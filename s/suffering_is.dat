5|$|Since the 18th century, {{people have}} become {{increasingly}} concerned about the welfare of farm animals. Possible measures of welfare include longevity, behavior, physiology, reproduction, freedom from disease, and freedom from immunosuppression. Standards and laws for animal welfare have been created worldwide, broadly {{in line with the}} most widely held position in the western world, a form of utilitarianism: that it is morally acceptable for humans to use non-human animals, provided that no unnecessary <b>suffering</b> <b>is</b> caused, and that the benefits to humans outweigh the costs to the livestock. An opposing view is that animals have rights, should not be regarded as property, and should never be used by humans.|$|E
5|$|The Irenaean theodicy is a Christian theodicy {{designed}} {{to respond to}} the problem of evil. As such, it defends the probability of an omnipotent and omnibenevolent (all-powerful and perfectly loving) God in the face of evidence of evil in the world. Numerous variations of theodicy have been proposed which all maintain that, while evil exists, God is either not responsible for creating evil, or he is not guilty for creating evil. Typically, the Irenaean theodicy asserts that the world is {{the best of all possible}} worlds because it allows humans to fully develop. Most versions of the Irenaean theodicy propose that creation is incomplete, as humans are not yet fully developed, and experiencing evil and <b>suffering</b> <b>is</b> necessary for such development.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of process theology has challenged the Irenaean tradition by teaching that God's power is limited {{and that he}} cannot be responsible for evil. Twentieth century philosopher Alvin Plantinga supported {{the idea that this}} world is the best possible world, arguing that the good in the world (including God's infinite goodness) outweighs the evil and proposing that the ultimate good of God's sacrifice when Jesus was crucified necessitated the existence of evil. His free will defence was not a theodicy because he was trying to show the logical compatibility of evil and the existence of God, rather than the probability of God. D. Z. Phillips and Fyodor Dostoyevsky challenged the instrumental use of suffering, suggesting that love cannot be expressed through suffering. However, Dostoyevsky also states that the beauty of love is evident, in that love can continue to grow, withstand and overcome even the most evil acts. Michael Tooley argued that the magnitude of <b>suffering</b> <b>is</b> excessive and that, in some cases, cannot lead to moral development. French theologian Henri Blocher criticised Hick's universalism, arguing that such a view negates free will, which was similarly important to the theodicy.|$|E
5000|$|... "The Noble Truth of <b>Suffering</b> (dukkha), monks, <b>is</b> this: birth (jati) <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> aging <b>is</b> <b>suffering...,</b> death <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> {{association}} with the unpleasant <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> dissociation from the pleasant <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> not to receive what one desires is suffering—in brief the five aggregates subject to grasping are suffering." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the Buddha's first discourse, Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta (SN 56.11), the Buddha is {{recorded}} as defining [...] "suffering" [...] (dukkha) {{in a manner}} that incorporates the first four remembrances: [...] "Birth <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> aging <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> sickness <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> death <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> association with the unpleasant <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> dissociation from the pleasant <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> not to receive what one desires is suffering...." [...] This formula is reiterated throughout the Pali Canon.|$|R
5000|$|Now this, bhikkhus, is {{the noble}} truth of <b>suffering</b> dukkha: birth <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> aging <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> illness (byādhi) <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> death <b>is</b> suffering; union {{with what is}} displeasing is suffering; {{separation}} from what is pleasing is suffering; not to get what one wants is suffering; in brief, the five aggregates subject to clinging <b>are</b> <b>suffering.</b>|$|R
5|$|The story depicts how <b>suffering</b> <b>is</b> {{essential}} to completing one's destiny. Southey's purpose in Thalaba, however, {{is to describe}} {{as many of the}} various myths and superstitions that he can, and this interferes with the resolving of moral problems within the story. Instead, the moral lessons are formulaic and the events focus on awards given to those who are obedient. Southey's emphasis on the actual mythic incidents over the moral events are backed up with more than 80 pages of his own notes that describe the various references to traditional myths or mythic creatures that are incorporated into the story. In terms of structure, the unilateral plot keeps Thalaba does not allow for an easy flow into various mythic incidents. Instances of the plot being supplanted by the myths can be found during the descriptions of the story of Irem, Haruth and Maruth, or others.|$|E

25|$|Job laments {{the day of}} his birth; {{he would}} like to die, but even that is denied to him. His three friends Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, console him. The friends do not waver in their belief that Job's <b>suffering</b> <b>is</b> a {{punishment}} for sin, for God causes no one to suffer innocently, and they advise him to repent and seek God's mercy. Job responds with scorn: a just God would not treat him so harshly, patience in <b>suffering</b> <b>is</b> impossible, and the Creator should not take his creatures so lightly, to come against them with such force.|$|E
25|$|Richardson et al. {{provide the}} example of {{behavioral}} therapy and psychodynamic therapy. If a therapist wanted {{to understand how the}} world affects his clients, he might integrate behavioral therapy into his practice. But, once he wanted to understand the inner dynamics of the psyche, he would have to integrate psychodynamic therapy in with behavioral therapy. The problem is that psychodynamic therapy says human <b>suffering</b> <b>is</b> caused by the conflicts and turmoil within the inner psyche while behavioral therapy says that human <b>suffering</b> <b>is</b> caused by external stimuli, reinforcement, and other forms of conditioning. These two theories are in direct contradiction to each other.|$|E

25|$|Antisthenes, a pupil of Socrates, first {{outlined}} {{the themes of}} Cynicism, stating {{that the purpose of}} life is living a life of Virtue which agrees with Nature.

25|$|Civil disobedience and {{non-cooperation}} as practised under Satyagraha {{are based}} on the “law of suffering”, a doctrine that the endurance of <b>suffering</b> <b>is</b> a means to an end. This end usually implies a moral upliftment or progress of an individual or society. Therefore, non-cooperation in Satyagraha is in fact a means to secure the cooperation of the opponent consistently with truth and justice.|$|E

25|$|According to B.R. Ambedkar, the Indian Buddhist Dalit leader, {{the four}} truths {{were not part}} of the {{original}} teachings of the Buddha, but a later aggregation, due to Hindu influences. According to Ambedkar, total cessation of <b>suffering</b> <b>is</b> an illusion; yet, the Buddhist Middle Path aims at the reduction of suffering and the maximizing of happiness, balancing both sorrow and happiness.|$|E
25|$|The Cynical life rejects {{conventional}} {{desires for}} wealth, power, health, and fame, by being {{free of the}} possessions acquired in pursuing the conventional. As reasoning creatures, people could achieve happiness via rigorous training, by living in a way natural to human beings. The world equally belongs to everyone, so <b>suffering</b> <b>is</b> caused by false judgments of what is valuable and what is worthless per the customs and conventions of society.|$|E

25|$|In the Theravada tradition, {{suffering}} {{arises when}} one identifies with or {{clings to the}} aggregates. This <b>suffering</b> <b>is</b> extinguished by relinquishing attachments to aggregates. The Mahayana tradition asserts {{that the nature of}} all aggregates is intrinsically empty of independent existence. The use of the skandhas concept to explain the self is unique to Buddhism among major Indian religions. It is not shared by Hinduism and Jainism, which believe that a living being has an eternal soul or metaphysical self.|$|E

25|$|The most {{dramatic}} festivals can be witnessed during the Mal ay Aldo, {{which is the}} Kapampangan expression of the Holy Week.

The melody of the Kapampangan pasion {{was said to have}} been taken from their traditional epic, whose original words were lost and replaced by the story of Christ. The highlight of the Mal ay Aldo celebration is the procession of the magdarame or sasalibatbat penitents covered in blood from self-flagellation. Some of them even have themselves crucified every Good Friday at the dried up swamp of barrio Cutud in San Fernando.|$|E
