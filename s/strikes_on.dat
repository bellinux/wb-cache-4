5|$|Harp and Mayer {{conducted}} an experiment using a lesson about lightning strikes. The effect of lightning <b>strikes</b> <b>on</b> airplanes was added as a seductive detail. In {{six out of}} six experiments, learners who studied the base lesson without the seductive details about the <b>strikes</b> <b>on</b> airplanes demonstrated they were {{three times more likely}} to recall the structurally important details. They also performed much better on a problem-solving task than learners whose lessons included the seductive details. Harper and Mayer suggested seductive details do their damage when learners are consolidating and organizing new information by forming knowledge structures ill-suited for later recall.|$|E

5|$|Founded in 2015, Donecle, a Toulouse {{start-up}} company, {{has also}} launched a drone approach which was initially specialized in {{the detection of}} lightning <b>strikes</b> <b>on</b> aeroplanes. Performed by five people equipped with harnesses and platforms, this inspection usually takes about eight hours. The immobilization of the aircraft and the staff are costly for the airlines, estimated at $10 000 per hour. The solution proposed by the start-up lasts twenty minutes.|$|E
