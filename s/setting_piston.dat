In this <b>setting,</b> <b>piston</b> configurations are analyzed in which the piston is modeled by a potential. For these configurations, analytic results for the Casimir energy and force are obtained by employing the zeta function regularization method. Also, explicit numerical results for the Casimir force are provided for pistons modeled by a class of compactly supported potentials that are realizable as delta-sequences. These results are then generalized to higher dimensional pistons by considering additional Kaluza-Klein dimensions. Comment: 21 Pages, 5 Figure...|$|E

5000|$|A swing-piston {{engine is}} a type of {{internal}} combustion engine in which the pistons move in a circular motion inside a ring-shaped [...] "cylinder", moving closer and further from each other to provide compression and expansion. Generally two <b>sets</b> of <b>pistons</b> are used, geared to move in a fixed relationship as they rotate around the cylinder. In some versions the pistons oscillate around a fixed center, as opposed to rotating around the entire engine. The design has also been referred to as a oscillating piston engine, vibratory engine when the pistons oscillate instead of rotate, or toroidal engine based on the shape of the [...] "cylinder".|$|R
5000|$|A more {{advanced}} system {{which is still}} in use in some organs is the electropneumatic capture system. To <b>set</b> a <b>piston,</b> the organist must press and hold the desired piston while pulling the desired stops. The motion of the stop control sets a mechanical on/off tab or lever on a rocker arm inside the combination action, allowing the configuration to be recalled from the set tabs. Since this [...] "hold-and-set" [...] system depended on manipulation of the stop controls, it was always located within the console. It represented an improvement over the setterboard in that the organist could remain seated at the console while altering registrations. These combination actions were actually early mechanical digital-memory storage devices.|$|R
50|$|Big Bertha's {{cylinder}} arrangement was unusual. There were four cylinders {{but only two}} <b>sets</b> of <b>piston</b> valves because there was insufficient space under the smokebox to fit piston valves for the inside cylinders. Instead, the large outside piston valves (as well as supplying the outside cylinders) supplied the inside cylinders through cross-over steam ports. The steam-flow characteristics would have been poor (because {{of the length of}} the ports) but this would not have mattered unduly in an engine that ran only at slow speed. It has been suggested that this design has been influenced by the four-cylinder cross-ported arrangement of the Italian 0-10-0 FS Class 470 heavy freight locomotive (in which this was motivated by its being part of an asymmetrical compound design), of which a complete set of drawings were stored at Derby.|$|R

Analytic results of the sound power are obtained and numerical simulations show {{that it is possible to}} reduce the radiation from a small <b>piston</b> <b>set</b> in a rigid sphere similar to the size of a human head up to a certain frequency. It is found that the introduction of the scattering object makes significant differences from the active control without scattering objects. This being the case, the scattering object makes the active noise control easier. To increase the global reduction of sound-power output, the optimal number and locations of the control sources and the optimal number and locations of error sensors are discussed.

50|$|Dynamic {{balance of}} in-line 4's {{requires}} a weight matched <b>set</b> of <b>pistons</b> and con-rods. The con-rods must be matched for rotating {{mass of the}} big end taken to be lower 1/3 of the rod and reciprocating mass of little end taken to be the other 2/3.

All cranks are balanced at manufacture to OEM spec, this is adequate for domestic use. As performance cars are usually stripped of interior and have harder suspension the vibration from the engine becomes less of a consideration so balancing to better than OEM spec is of little worth. If a crank has been re-worked then it needs re-balancing to OEM spec.|$|R

50|$|The {{engine was}} unusual in being an {{opposed piston engine}} where each {{horizontal}} cylinder contains two pistons, one at each end, that move in opposition to each other. Even more unusually, both <b>sets</b> of <b>pistons</b> drove only a single crankshaft; most opposed piston engines have a separate crankshaft {{at each end of}} the cylinder. The TS3 engine used a single crankshaft beneath the cylinders, each piston driving it through a connecting rod, a rocker lever and a second connecting rod. The crankshaft had six crankpins and there were six rockers. The engine was a two-stroke, compression-ignition diesel engine with uniflow-ported cylinders. Scavenging was performed by a Roots blower. which was mounted on the front of the engine and driven by a long quill shaft from a chain drive at the rear of the engine. Although the engines gained a reputation for good performance, this quill shaft was somewhat prone to breaking if over-worked.|$|R

Earlier variable compression engines have been highly desirable but technically unobtainable for production vehicles due to the mechanical complexity and difficulty of controlling all of the parameters.

The seal and the RC- 34 material, which may soon be available for use in the family auto, were developed by Ramsey Corporation, St. Louis, Missouri, a division of TRW Automotive Worldwide. The oil in an automobile engine must be I replaced every few thousand miles not because it wears out but because it becomes contaminated. The contamination sources are gasoline and combustion gases which blow by the piston rings to mix with the oil, reducing the oil's ability to lubricate properly. Seeking to prolong oil life by eliminating "blowby," Ramsey Corporation looked for a better way to seal piston rings and used NASA technology as a departure point. The parent company TRW, under contract to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, had developed seals and bladders from a type of material called elastomers which where designed to withstand the environmental extremes of interplanetary flight.

The analytical results are illustrated with numerical examples in which the piston is pulsating near the rigid/compliant boundary of a water-filled halfspace. Subsequently, the basic acoustic field quantities such as the acoustic radiation impedance load and the radiation intensity distribution are evaluated for representative values of the parameters characterizing the system.

40|$|This program aims at {{improving}} {{the efficiency of}} advanced natural-gas reciprocating engines (ANGRE) by reducing piston and piston ring assembly friction without major adverse effects on engine performance, such as increased oil consumption and wear. An iterative process of simulation, experimentation and analysis is being followed towards achieving the goal of demonstrating a complete optimized low-friction engine system. To date, a detailed <b>set</b> of <b>piston</b> and piston-ring dynamic and friction models have been developed and applied that illustrate the fundamental relationships between design parameters and friction losses. Low friction ring designs have already been recommended in a previous phase, with full-scale engine validation partially completed. Current accomplishments include the addition of several additional power cylinder design areas to the overall system analysis. These include analyses of lubricant and cylinder surface finish and a parametric study of piston design. The Waukesha engine {{was found to be}} already well optimized in the areas of lubricant, surface skewness and honing cross-hatch angle, where friction reductions of 12 % for lubricant, and 5 % for surface characteristics, are projected. For the piston, a friction reduction of up to 50 % may be possible by controlling waviness alone, while additional friction reductions are expected when other parameters are optimized. A total power cylinder friction reduction of 30 - 50 % is expected, translating to an engine efficiency increase of two percentage points from its current baseline towards the goal of 50 % efficiency.

The completed Phase II convertor is in the bolted configuration to allow future disassembly. By the end of Phase II, the convertor had passed all of the final testing requirements in preparation for delivery to the NASA Glenn Research Center.

Fabrication of the direct-current to direct-current (DC-DC) output stage, which would have stepped down the main controller output voltage from ~ 700 to 120 V(sub DC), was omitted from {{this phase of the}} project for budgetary reasons.

The project extended significantly longer than originally planned because of yearly funding delays. The team also experienced several hardware difficulties along the development path. Most of these were related to the different thermal expansions of adjacent parts constructed of different materials. This issue was made worse by the large size of the machine. Thermal expansion problems also caused difficulties in the brazing of the opposed stainless steel sodium-potassium (NaK) heater head.

50|$|A Griggs {{apparatus}} has {{the ability}} to create and maintain confining pressure on a sample while separately being able to strain the sample. Confining pressure is generated by advancing a hydraulic ram either by using a hand operated lever pump or a servo controlled syringe pump. The advancing ram then compresses the outer tungsten carbide piston (σ3) that in turn depresses the Pb plug {{at the top of the}} sample assembly and then in turn stresses the NaCl pressure medium. Deviatoric stress is created by a mechanical drive train that is powered by an electric motor that sits on top of the apparatus. When the electric motor is powered it engages with a set of gears that allow for variable strain rates to be chosen that range from 10−3sec-1 down to 10−8sec-1. To eliminate the torque from the advancing drive train produced by the gear set, a recirculating ball screw is located in between the gear <b>set</b> and deformation <b>piston</b> (σ1) that provides the axial load. Connected in series with the deformation piston is also an external load cell which measures the load applied to the inner (σ1). The outer (σ3) and inner (σ1) pistons that sit above the sample are two separate pieces, this allows for the advancement of the deformation piston with the drive train without altering the confining pressure which is operated with the hydraulic ram.|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{validation}} of analytical model. The {{objective of this}} study was to validate existing analytical models of the friction force and leakage for O-ring seals at high pressure, where high pressure is defined as 2000 psi. A <b>set</b> of three <b>pistons</b> with 9, 6, and 4 mm bore were used in this experiment. Each piston had a single O-ring seal located in the cap end. To validate the friction force model, the force efficiency was measured by exerting a load on a piston and collecting pressure, load, and displacement measurements during constant piston descent. To validate the leakage model, a static leakage test was performed by measuring the displacement of the piston after being exposed to a constant load for an extended amount of time. Results indicated that the friction force efficiency model was valid for a range of pressures between 500 and 2000 psi, which indicates that the model for O-ring friction holds at high pressure. Results from the leakage test showed that the piston moved close to 600 microns during the first 12 hours of testing and did not move for the remaining 36 hours. This indicates that O-ring seals are leak-free, so the volumetric efficiency can be approximated to be 100 %. Simple O-ring seal models can be used to compute the overall efficiency of small-scale hydraulic systems at high pressure.
