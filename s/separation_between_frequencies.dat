40|$|A {{method for}} stability-robustness {{analysis}} {{based on a}} quadratic Liapunov function that varies linearly with uncertainty parameters is derived. Linear time-invariant systems with structured uncertainties are discussed. The Liapunov function is optimized numerically to maximize the robustness region in parameter space. Numerical results are given for four examples in which the first-order method is compared to previous Liapunov methods. While the zero-order method is slightly better than the first-order method for one example, the first-order method is clearly superior in the other three (more realistic) examples. The first-order method is especially superior for the active control of flexible structures, where robustness with respect to (1) unmodeled coupling between modeled modes and (2) unmodeled modes is important. For such applications, the first-order method is much better at detecting the increased robustness associated with increased <b>separation</b> <b>between</b> <b>frequencies...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{satellite}} communication, Spatial Division Multiple Access (SDMA) {{has become}} one of the most promising techniques that can accommodate continuing increase in the number of users and traffic demands. The technology is based on radio resource sharing that separates communication channels in space. It relies on adaptive and dynamic beam-forming technology and well-designed algorithms for resource allocation among which frequency assignment is considered. This paper studies static Frequency Assignment Problem (FAP) in a satellite communication system involving a satellite and a number of users located in a service area. The objective is to maximize the number of users that the system can serve while maintaining the signal to interference plus noise ratio of each user under a predefined threshold. Traditionally, interference is treated as fixed (binary interferences or fixed minimal required <b>separation</b> <b>between</b> <b>frequencies).</b> In this paper, the interference is cumulative and variable. To solve the problem, we work on both discrete and continuous optimizations. Integer linear programming formulations and greedy algorithms are proposed for solving the discrete frequency assignment problem. The solution is further improved by beam decentring algorithm which involves continuous adjustment of satellite beams and deals with non-linear change of interference...|$|E
40|$|Low {{amplitude}} is {{the defining}} characteristic of solar-like oscillations. The space projects Kepler and CoRoT give us {{a great opportunity to}} successfully detect such oscillations in numerous targets. Achievements of asteroseismology depend on new discoveries of connections between the oscillation frequencies and stellar properties. In the previous studies, the frequency of the maximum amplitude and the large <b>separation</b> <b>between</b> <b>frequencies</b> were used for this purpose. In the present study, we confirm that the large separation between the frequencies has two minima at two different frequency values. These are the signatures of the He II ionization zone, and as such have very strong diagnostic potential. We relate these minima to fundamental stellar properties such as mass, radius, luminosity, age and mass of convective zone. For mass, the relation is simply based on the ratio of the frequency of minimum Δν to the frequency of maximum amplitude. These frequency comparisons can be very precisely computed, and thus the mass and radius of a solar-like oscillating star can be determined to high precision. We also develop a new asteroseismic diagram which predicts structural and evolutionary properties of stars with such data. We derive expressions for mass, radius, effective temperature, luminosity and age in terms of purely asteroseismic quantities. For solar-like oscillating stars, we now will have five very important asteroseismic tools (two frequencies of minimum Δν, the frequency of maximum amplitude, and the large and small separations between the oscillation frequencies) to decipher properties of stellar interior astrophysics.

A modification is done in such a way that, a gap coupling is used to increase the <b>separation</b> <b>between</b> the <b>frequency</b> bands.

These were supplemented with motion packages that measure linear accelerations, from which an assessment of cable displacement and speed was made. Motions due to vortex-induced vibrations caused by interaction of the mean flow with the cable are small (rms < 0. 15 cable diameters) and unlikely to affect estimates of the temperature variance dissipation rate χ[subscript]T. Surface wave–induced cable motions are significant, commonly resulting in vertical displacements of ± 1 m and vertical speeds of ± 0. 5 m s⁻¹ on 2 – 10 -s periods. These motions produce an enhancement to the measurement of temperature gradient in the surface wave band herein that {{is equal to the}} product of the vertical cable speed and the vertical temperature gradient (i. e., dT/dt ~w[subscript]cdT/dz). However, the temperature gradient spectrum is largely unaltered at higher and lower frequencies; in particular, there exists a clear scale <b>separation</b> <b>between</b> <b>frequencies</b> contaminated by surface waves and the turbulence subrange.

40|$|Radio {{frequency}} (RF) {{power amplifiers}} (PAs) represent {{the most challenging}} design parts of wireless transmitters. In order to be more energy efficient, PAs should operate in nonlinear region where they produce distortion that significantly degrades the quality of signal at transmitter’s output. With the aim of reducing this distortion and improve signal quality, digital predistortion (DPD) techniques are widely used. This work focuses on improving the performances of DPDs in modern, next-generation wireless transmitters. A new adaptive DPD based on an iterative injection approach is developed and experimentally verified using a 4 G signal. The signal performances at transmitter output are notably improved, while the proposed DPD does not require large digital signal processing memory resources and computational complexity. Moreover, the injection-based DPD theory is extended to be applicable in concurrent dual-band wireless transmitters. A cross-modulation problem specific to concurrent dual-band transmitters is investigated in detail and novel DPD based on simultaneous injection of intermodulation and cross-modulation distortion products is proposed. In order to mitigate distortion compensation limit phenomena and memory effects in highly nonlinear RF PAs, this DPD is further extended and complete generalised DPD system for concurrent dual-band transmitters is developed. It is clearly proved in experiments that the proposed predistorter remarkably improves the in-band and out-of-band performances of both signals. Furthermore, it {{does not depend on}} <b>frequency</b> <b>separation</b> <b>between</b> <b>frequency</b> bands and has significantly lower complexity in comparison with previously reported concurrent dual-band DPDs...|$|R

40|$|The large <b>separations</b> <b>between</b> the {{oscillation}} <b>frequencies</b> of solar-like {{stars are}} measures of stellar mean density. The separations have been {{thought to be}} mostly constant in the observed range of frequencies. However, detailed investigation shows {{that they are not}} constant, and their variations are not random but have very strong diagnostic potential for our understanding of stellar structure and evolution. In this regard, frequencies of the minimum large separation are very useful tools. From these frequencies, in addition to the large separation and frequency of maximum amplitude, Yı ldı z et al. recently have developed new methods to find almost all the fundamental stellar properties. In the present study, we aim to find metallicity and helium abundances from the frequencies, and generalize the relations given by Yı ldı z et al. for a wider stellar mass range and arbitrary metallicity (Z) and helium abundance (Y). We show that the effect of metallicity is significant for most of the fundamental parameters. For stellar mass, for example, the expression must be multiplied by (Z/Z_) ^ 0. 12. For arbitrary helium abundance, M ∝ (Y/Y_) ^ 0. 25. Methods for determination of Z and Y from pure asteroseismic quantities are based on amplitudes (differences between maximum and minimum values of) in the oscillatory component in the spacing of oscillation frequencies. Additionally, we demonstrate that the difference between the first maximum and the second minimum is very sensitive to Z.

The work starts by looking at designing a dual-wavelength laser inspired by work presented in the literature; with particular emphasis on reducing the wavelength spacing between the two wavelengths and improving the positions of the quantum-wells (QW) in order to reduce the residual absorption in the QWs. This naturally leads on to investigations into the effects of linewidth, and linewidth enhancement, on the performance of the device. It is found that linewidth enhancement is not a limiting factor in the design of dual-wavelength lasers. The thesis will then investigate the technique of injection locking, simulated by rate equations, in order to investigate, in detail, the various behavioural regions exhibited by such a scheme under varying injection rates and detuning frequencies. The scheme will consist of a two laser system approach, whereby both unidirectional and bidirectional injection locking will be investigated. The disadvantage to such a scheme is the fact that there will be a zero <b>frequency</b> <b>separation</b> <b>between</b> the lasers <b>frequencies</b> while operating in the locked condition, hence the injection locking scheme will provide a building block for a three laser locking system based on four-wave mixing (FWM). The interest in injection locking has been proven to be of great interest in the world of optics, ever since the Dutch scientist, Christiaan Huygens, discovered the phenomenon while confined to bed with illness during the 17 th century. Such an approach has shown to be durable and efficient in improving the spectral and dynamic performance of directly modulated laser diodes. The scheme of injection locking will be utilized in order to build a system based on the FWM phenomenon with a nonzero <b>frequency</b> <b>separation</b> <b>between</b> the lasers’ <b>frequencies.</b> As with the injection locking scheme, the various behavioural patterns at varying injection rates and detuning frequencies will be thoroughly investigated. The resilience of the system to perturbations (modulation response) will then be investigated, and the performance of the three laser FWM system will be compared to that of an uncoupled laser, whereby the phasor difference between the first and the second laser is calculated. The amplitude of the resultant wave is then compared to the amplitude of the uncoupled wave in order to establish whether or not the three laser FWM system supresses any of the introduced perturbations. It is found that the more the injection rate is increased, the more the FWM system supresses the effect of the perturbations, where a maximum improvement of 44...|$|R
