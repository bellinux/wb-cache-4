2500|$|In the United Kingdom, {{the second}} episode was {{scheduled}} against ITV's Emmerdale for 30 minutes, and was watched during its BBC One broadcast {{on the night}} by 2.7million viewers. This was a reduction from the previous week (4.19million). Sophie Dainty (Digital Spy) said {{this could have been}} because of its clash with Emmerdale, as they were not scheduled against each other the previous week. However, while episode 1 received similar viewership to that of the preceding episode of EastEnders, the episode of EastEnders that preceded episode 2 of Redwater was watched by 5.1million viewers on the night of broadcast, meaning that many EastEnders viewers did not <b>stay</b> <b>tuned</b> <b>to</b> BBC One to watch its spin-off. Dainty said, [...] "This is bound to raise questions of whether Redwater is in the wrong slot going up against Emmerdale, given that the clash is bound to leave soap fans with divided loyalties over which one to watch live".|$|E

50|$|Other errors {{which appear}} to be in the tuner are {{actually}} the result of incorrect data sent by one or more stations, often including missing electronic program guide data. Many ATSC tuners will remember EPG info for each station, but only for a few hours after viewing a channel on that station. Some will not remember at all (displaying only the required channel banner), while a very few others will store data for days (although this requires <b>staying</b> <b>tuned</b> <b>to</b> each station {{for more than a few}} seconds in order to receive the extended info). DirecTV receivers with ATSC tuners can download the guide at any time, while other TiVo units download guide data separately. TV Guide On Screen can also be used for this, but very few if any ATSC tuners include this (which requires downloading all guide data for all channels from one particular station). Stations sending the wrong time are also a major problem, as this can skew or ruin guide data for all stations until correct time is received again from a different and correctly set station.|$|R

40|$|Without {{presenting}} features {{different from}} those of the national language as regards grammar structures or the basic vocabulary, specialized languages raise terminology and contextualization problems, which, in the case of specialized translations, require certain competences from the part of translators, whether they are linguists or specialists in the field. They have to consider the synchronization of notions and conceptual equivalences, and <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> constantly <b>tuned</b> <b>to</b> the terminology dynamics. There are many circumstances in which the economic language demonstrates the quality of being a living language and, at the same time, a very technical language.

40|$|Abstract. During human-human interaction, emotion plays a {{vital role}} in {{structuring}} dialogue. Emotional content drives features such as topic shift, lexicalisation change and timing; it affects the delicate balance between goals related to the task at hand and those of social interaction; and it represents one type of feedback on the effect that utterances are having. These various facets are so central to most real-world interaction, that it is reasonable to suppose that emotion should also {{play an important role in}} human-computer interaction. To that end, techniques for detecting, modelling, and responding appropriately to emotion are explored, and an architecture for bringing these techniques together into a coherent system is presented. I. Computers with Emotional Users Emotion plays a central role in human communication, and especially in those communicative contexts in which there is disagreement. Dispute partners, consciously or not, <b>stay</b> finely <b>tuned</b> <b>to</b> each other’s emotional reactions, constantly weighing their partner’s reactions against possible outcomes, relationship maintenance, and goal achievement.

50|$|The Zero Point System {{acts like}} the Hipshot Tremsetter, {{in that it}} {{provides}} additional string tension {{that is needed to}} return the string to the zero position. Normally both the spring tension and opposing string tension is equal, when a tremolo bar is used for a very long duration (such as excessive dive bombs), the spring tension may be compressed to the point that no tension is provided for the string. Thus, the ZPS, which equips with two additional springs, provide the needed tension {{and the fact that it}} is a stop-bar allows extreme tuning stability at the cost of having very limited scope for up-bends. Another important innovation of the ZR tremolo is that, unlike other locking tremolos, even with a string break, the other strings can still <b>stay</b> in <b>tune</b> <b>to</b> an acceptable level. The ball-bearing and global tuner features of the ZR tremolos are manufactured under license to American Inventor and recording artist, Geoffrey Lee McCabe -- see U.S. Patent Nos. 6,175,066 5,965,831, 6,891,094, 5,986,191, 6,563,034 and 7,470,841.|$|R
