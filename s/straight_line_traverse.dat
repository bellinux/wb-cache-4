40|$|The {{reconstruction}} of 3 D scenes constituted by <b>straight</b> <b>lines</b> can find many applications both in Computer vision and in Mobile robotics.

In general, using a noncentral camera, the viewing rays starting from the points of a <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> constitute a non-planar surface: if this non-planar surface only contains one <b>straight</b> <b>line,</b> other than the viewing rays, then the <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> can univocally be localized.

40|$|Due to the {{discrete}} distribution computing errors {{and lack of}} adaptability are ubiquitous in the current <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> extraction for TLS data methods. A 3 D <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> segment extraction method is proposed based on spherical projection for single station terrestrial laser point clouds. Firstly, horizontal and vertical angles of each laser point are calculated by means of spherical coordinates, intensity panoramic image according to the two angles is generated. Secondly, edges which include <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> features are detected from intensity panoramic image by using of edge detection algorithm. Thirdly, great circles are detected from edges of panoramic image using spherical Hough transform. According to the axiom that a <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> segment in 3 D space is a spherical great circle after spherical projection, detecting great circles from spherical projected data sets is essentially detecting <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> segments from 3 D data sets without spherical projection. Finally, a robust 3 D <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> fitting method is employed to fitting the <b>straight</b> <b>lines</b> and calculating parameters of the <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> segments.
