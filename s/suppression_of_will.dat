Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 164 - 197). This dissertation critically examines how linguistic and discursive practices in global media discourses devalorize the revolutionary {{implications of the}} so called Arab Spring. By using media framing analysis it approaches the global media’s construct of the Arab Spring as a revolutionary event in three steps. First, it analyzes framing and usage of the name Arab Spring, showing how the name itself implies two defining characteristics of the events: the Arabness and the Springness. Second, it focuses on the universal conception of revolution, questioning its relationship with Western modernity that affects the way global media approach and represent non- Western revolutions. Third, it compares global media practices with local media practices, highlighting how Eurocentric understanding of the events affects media reporting in global news outlets. The thesis finds that regional, cultural, and political peculiarities of the Arab Spring affected global media’s reporting. When the global Western media approached the revolutions in the Arab world, the Arab Spring {{was not just a}} name; it became a condensation of political and social contexts that provided the meaning for the events. Western media has conceptualized the Arab Spring as a regional Arab event, a temporary awakening, that can suddenly turn into a <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> <b>will</b> and progress. Further on the concept of revolution as used by the media failed to explain the events: first, because the concept is defined by its own Western identity; second, because it is defined with its own understanding of modernization and progress that is specific to the European context. by Petra Cafnik Uludağ.

50|$|The {{reason for}} the {{increased}} infection rate in vitamin A deficient populations {{is due to the}} T-killer cells which require retinoids to proliferate correctly (Athanassiades1981). Retinoic acid binds the promoter region of specific genes and so activates the transcription process and therefore cell replication (Baron 1981). A vitamin A deficient diet will have a very limited surplus of retinol and so cell proliferation and replication will be suppressed, contributing to a reduced number of T-cells and lymphocytes. <b>Suppression</b> <b>of</b> these <b>will</b> result in a lack of immune reaction if pathogens become present in the body and consequently a greater susceptibility to incubation of disease.|$|R

40|$|Top predators can {{suppress}} mesopredators {{by killing}} them, competing for resources and instilling fear, {{but it is}} unclear how <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> mesopredators varies with the distribution and abundance of top predators at large spatial scales and among different ecological contexts. We suggest that <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> mesopredators <b>will</b> be strongest where top predators occur at high densities over large areas. These conditions are more likely to occur in the core than on the margins of top predator ranges. We propose the Enemy Constraint Hypothesis, which predicts weakened top-down effects on mesopredators towards the edge of top predators% ranges. Using bounty data from North America, Europe and Australia we show that the effects of top predators on mesopredators increase from the margin towards the core of their ranges, as predicted. Continuing global contraction of top predator ranges could promote further release of mesopredator populations, altering ecosystem structure and contributing to biodiversity loss...|$|R

Examining the ecological, social, political, and economic aspects surrounding fire management activities on these scales will help ensure healthier ecosystems in perpetuity.

40|$|A sliding mode {{controller}} (SMC) {{is proposed}} for the tip position control of a flexible manipulator. The authors' objectives are to control the tip to a desired position and to reduce vibrations as much as possible. Vibrations inherited from a light-weight manipulator structure are expensive to measure for feedback control purposes. Here, the authors approximate the vibrations by the first-order dominant mode. The sliding mode controller is employed for its insensitivity to modelling errors. When using a DC motor as the actuator, the system under control behaves as a single input multiple output system; {{it is difficult to}} satisfy both control objectives simultaneously. Here, a fuzzy-like weighting factor is imposed on the control signals. When the tracking error is large, tracking will have a higher priority and constitutes a larger portion of the control signal. <b>Suppression</b> <b>of</b> vibration <b>will</b> be effected when the tracking error is small while the portion of the tracking control signal is reduced.

In adults, mutations in a dominant and highly conserved B 27 -restricted Gag CTL epitope lead to loss of recognition and disease progression In mothers expressing HLA-B 27 who transmit HIV- 1 perinatally, we document transmission of viruses encoding CTL escape variants in this dominant Gag epitope that no longer bind to B 27. Their infected infants target an otherwise subdominant B 27 -restricted epitope and fail to contain HIV replication. These CTL escape variants remain stable without reversion {{in the absence of the}} evolutionary pressure that originally selected the mutation.

40|$|An {{operating}} mode {{with a very}} high confinement core like the VH-mode but a very low power flow to the divertor plates and low edge particle confinement like an L-mode would be beneficial. For a large tokamak like the proposed ITER, the power density at the separatrix is not that far above the scaled H-mode power threshold so not much of the power can be radiated inside of the separatrix without causing a return to L-mode. The thicker scrape-off layer of an L-mode increases the radiating volume of the scrape-off layer and helps shield impurities from the core. This is especially important if the first wall is metallic. In this paper an H-mode transport model based on E x B velocity shear <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> turbulence <b>will</b> be used {{to show that it}} is possible to have a strongly radiating mantle near the separatrix, which keeps the edge in L-mode, while having a VH-mode core with a broad region of suppressed turbulence.

The author argues that continued <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> these claims <b>will</b> not further ATS party goals for Antarctica: peace, no military activity, and scientific inquiry.

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that neutrinos {{originating}} from ultra-high energy cosmic rays produce black holes deep in the atmosphere in models with TeV-scale quantum gravity. Such black holes would initiate quasi-horizontal showers of particles far above the standard model rate, so that the Auger Observatory would observe hundreds of black hole events. This would provide the first opportunity for experimental study of microscopic black holes. However, any phenomenologically viable model with a low scale of quantum gravity must explain how to preserve protons from rapid decay mediated by virtual black holes. We argue that unless this is accomplished by the gauging of baryon or lepton number, the <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> proton decay <b>will</b> also suppress quantum gravity mediated lepton-nucleon scattering, and hence black hole production by scattering of ultra-high energy cosmic ray neutrinos in the atmosphere.

We focus on the experimentally used parameters and explicitly model the transverse confining direction. Based on transition rates computed within the Floquet-Fermi golden rule we obtain band population dynamics which are {{in agreement with the}} dynamics observed in experiment. Finally, we discuss whether and how photon-assisted collisions that may be the source heating and band population dynamics might be suppressed in the experimental setup by appropriate design of the transverse confining potential.

Attention to these details will strengthen the hypothesis in my view. Haig’s hypothesis predicts that “Maximal night-waking…will … overlap with the greatest benefits of contraceptive suckling. Consistent with this expectation, infant sleep becomes more fragmented after six months and then gradually consolidates. ” Night wakings and sleep consolidation, however, are known to follow significantly different courses err the first year of life odependent on attachment classifications of the infants.

40|$|Antisense {{oligomers}} initially showed {{promise as}} compounds to modify gene expression, primarily through RNaseH induced {{degradation of the}} target transcript. Expansion of the field has led to new chemistries capable of invoking different mechanisms, including <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> protein synthesis by translational blockade and gene silencing using short interfering RNAs. It is now apparent {{that the majority of}} the eukaryotic genome is transcribed and non-protein coding RNAs have been implicated in the regulation of gene expression at many levels. This review considers potential therapeutic applications of antisense oligomers to modify gene expression, primarily by interfering with the process of exon recognition and intron removal during gene transcript splicing. While <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> gene expression <b>will</b> be necessary to address some conditions, it is likely that antisense oligomer splice modification will have extensive clinical application. Pre-mRNA splicing is a tightly co-ordinated, multifactorial process that can be disrupted by antisense oligomers in a highly specific manner to suppress aberrant splicing, remove exons to by-pass nonsense or frame-shifting mutations or influence exon selection to alter spliceoform ratios. Manipulation of splicing patterns has been applied to a diverse range of conditions, including b-thalassemia, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy and certain cancers. Alternative exon usage has been identified as a major mechanism for generating diversity from a limited repertoire of genes in higher eukaryotes.
