40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to compare psychosocial {{outcomes}} for 50 new clinic attendees, referred for cancer genetic counselling to five UK centres. The centres represented England, Scotland and Wales, and were randomly selected from groups ranked by different levels of clinical activity in cancer genetics practice. Questionnaires assessed demographic data, risk perception, mental health and use of health services pre-consultation and at 1 and 12 months follow-up. Satisfaction was measured for attendees and referring doctors at follow-up. A total of 256 unaffected adults fulfilled the study criteria. The five centres varied widely with respect to service organisation and activity, but all had a greater proportion of unaffected attendees with a breast cancer risk (61 - 91 %) than either a bowel cancer risk (0 - 33 %) or ovarian cancer risk (3 - 25 %). There were no significant differences in the psychosocial data <b>between</b> <b>centres</b> pre-counselling. No significant change over time occurred for any of the centres for risk perception or general psychological distress. There were significant differences <b>between</b> <b>centres</b> in reduction of cancer worry from baseline to 12 months and with the number of women who were recommended to have mammographic surveillance who had not received this. Overall, one-third of women for whom mammography had been recommended had not been screened within 1 year of follow-up. Subsequent attendance at the GP, but not at a hospital, was associated with risk level, but differences <b>between</b> <b>centres</b> could not be analysed. Satisfaction differed significantly <b>between</b> <b>centres</b> for 4 : 14 aspects of service provision and with 3 : 17 items concerning communication; satisfaction was high overall. Over 90 % of referring doctors were moderately/very satisfied with the service, but 23 % were dissatisfied with waiting times and 19 % with access to preventive treatment. Results differed significantly <b>between</b> <b>centres</b> for doctor's satisfaction with the provision of referral criteria and prescribing information. In conclusion, there were relatively few significant differences in psychosocial outcomes <b>between</b> <b>centres,</b> considering the wide variation in service organisation and activity. These significant differences were not consistent across the centres, therefore, differences could not be linked to specific aspects of service provision...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Assessment of centre {{variation}} in renal transplantation outcome {{provides an opportunity}} to examine differences in quality of care <b>between</b> <b>centres.</b> However, differences in outcome may represent differences in patient factors <b>between</b> <b>centres</b> and be biased by sampling variability and inadequate data ascertainment. METHODS: Differences in 12 -month graft survival in 1986 primary renal transplant adult recipients from 16 <b>centres</b> in Australia <b>between</b> 1993 and 1998 were examined. Fifteen recipient and donor factors known prior to transplantation were examined to determine factors independently predictive of graft survival. Differences <b>between</b> <b>centres</b> in these factors were examined. Unadjusted and multivariable adjusted outcomes for each centre were compared to the average for all centres. Multivariable hierarchical modelling was employed to account for potential bias due to sampling variability. RESULTS: Factors predictive of reduced 12 -month graft survival on multivariable analysis that were significantly different <b>between</b> <b>centres</b> were time on dialysis prior to transplantation, donor age, organ source, and number of human lymphocyte antigen mismatches. Unadjusted 12 -month graft survival for all centres was 91. 7 % and ranged from 83. 1 to 96. 4 %. Although two centres performed significantly lower than average, this poorer outcome was accounted for {{in one of these}} two centres after adjusting for factors shown to be independently predictive of outcome. However, multivariable hierarchical modelling failed to identify any centre as performing significantly different to average, with 12 -month graft survival ranging from 89. 2 to 92. 2 %. Outcome in patients excluded from the study due to inadequate data ascertainment was significantly worse than patients who were included. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of centre variation after accounting for {{variation in}} risk factors predictive of poor outcome <b>between</b> <b>centres,</b> as well as potential bias due to sampling variability. Exclusion of patients due to inadequate data remains an important source of bias in estimating accurate outcomes. Appropriate analytical strategies and consideration of sources of bias are important for the valid identification of centres with poorer outcomes. Esther M. Briganti, Rory Wolfe, Graeme R.

40|$|Wind tunnel {{aeroelastic}} model {{tests of}} the Commonwealth Advisory Aeronautical Research Council (CAARC) standard tall building were conducted using a three-degree-of-freedom base hinged aeroelastic(BRA) model. Experimental investigation into the effects of coupled translational-torsional motion, cross-wind/torsional frequency ratio and eccentricity <b>between</b> <b>centre</b> of mass and centre of stiffness on the wind-induced response characteristics and wind excitation mechanisms was carried out. The wind tunnel test results highlight the significant effects of coupled translational-torsional motion, and eccentricity <b>between</b> <b>centre</b> of mass and centre of stiffness, on both the normalised along-wind and cross-wind acceleration responses for reduced wind velocities ranging from 4 to 20. Coupled translational-torsional motion and eccentricity <b>between</b> <b>centre</b> of mass and centre of stiffness also have significant impacts on the amplitude-dependent effect caused by the vortex resonant process, and the transfer of vibrational energy between the along-wind and cross-wind directions. These resulted in either an increase or decrease of each response component, in particular at reduced wind velocities close to a critical value of 10. In addition, the contribution of vibrational energy from the torsional motion to the cross-wind response of the building model can be greatly amplified by the effect of resonance between the vortex shedding frequency and the torsional natural frequency of the building model...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Pregnancy rates {{cannot be}} used {{reliably}} for comparison of IVF clinic performance because of differences in patients between clinics. We investigate if differences in pregnancy chance <b>between</b> IVF <b>centres</b> remain after adjustment for patient mix. METHODS: We prospectively collected IVF and ICSI treatment data from 11 out of 13 IVF centres in the Netherlands, between 2002 and 2004. Adjustment for sampling variation was made using a random effects model. A prognostic index for subfertility-related factors was used to adjust for differences in patient mix. The remaining variability <b>between</b> <b>centres</b> was split into random variation and true differences. RESULTS: The crude 1 -year ongoing pregnancy chance per centre differed by nearly a factor 3 <b>between</b> <b>centres,</b> with hazard ratios (HRs) of 0. 48 (95 % CI: 0. 34 - 0. 69) to 1. 34 (95 % CI: 1. 18 - 1. 51) compared with the mean 1 -year ongoing pregnancy chance of all centres. After accounting for sampling variation, the difference shrank since HRs became 0. 66 (95 % CI: 0. 51 - 0. 85) to 1. 28 (95 % CI: 1. 13 - 1. 44). After adjustment for patient mix, the difference narrowed somewhat further to HRs of 0. 74 (95 % CI: 0. 57 - 0. 94) to 1. 33 (95 % CI: 1. 20 - 1. 48) and 17 % of the variation <b>between</b> <b>centres</b> {{could be explained by}} patient mix. The 1 -year cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate in the two most extreme centres was 36 % and 55 %. CONCLUSIONS: Only a minor part of the differences in pregnancy chance <b>between</b> IVF <b>centres</b> is explained by patient mix. Further research is needed to elucidate the causes of the remaining differences...|$|R
