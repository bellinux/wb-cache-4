Billerud is a paper packaging industry. Karlsborg is today one of Europe's biggest makers of white, porous paper for packaging of building materials, {{but they also have}} production of other <b>strong</b> <b>packaging</b> paper, and some white, long fiber sulphate mass. Part AB makes prefabricated bathrooms that they sell all over Europe. Rolfs Såg och hyvleri AB refined wood into building material like planks, but also saw dust pellets to heat houses. Borö Pannan AB makes accumulator tanks for water heating. Silja Line/Tallink AB are a phone service based office, taking advantage of the perception that the northern accent is pleasant to listen to over the phone, not to mention that the salaries up north are lower than in the south of Sweden.|$|E
40|$|The DNA-packaging {{specificities}} of phages λ and 21 {{depend on}} the specific DNA interactions of the small terminase subunits, which have support helix-turn-recognition helix-wing DNA-binding motifs. λ-Terminase with the recognition helix of 21 preferentially packages 21 DNA. This chimeric terminase's ability to package λDNA is reduced ∼ 20 -fold. Phage λ with the chimeric terminase is unable to form plaques, but pseudorevertants are readily obtained. Some pseudorevertants have trans-acting suppressors that change codons of the recognition helix. Some of these codons appear to remove an unfavorable base-pair contact; others appear to create a novel nonspecific DNA contact. Helper-packaging experiments show that these mutant terminases have {{lost the ability to}} discriminate between λ and 21 during DNA packaging. Two cis-acting suppressors affect cosB, the small subunit's DNA-binding site. Each changes a cosBλ-specific base pair to a cosB 21 -specific base pair. These cosB suppressors cause enhanced DNA packaging by 21 -specific terminase and reduce packaging by λ-terminase. Both the cognate support helix and turn are required for <b>strong</b> <b>packaging</b> discrimination. The wing does not contribute to cosB specificity. Evolution of packaging specificity is discussed, including a model in which λ- and 21 -packaging specificities diverged from a common ancestor phage with broad packaging specificity...|$|E
40|$|Ubuntu is a GNU/Linux {{distribution}} {{based on}} Debian Linux {{that has become}} popular on desktops, servers, and in cloud-based environments. In addition to being free and open source, {{one of the important}} features of Ubuntu is the packaging system. The packaging system allows users and administrators to easily install and update software packages while automatically handling the software dependencies that may be needed in order for the software to run. CRAN currently has binary packages of the latest versions of R as well as the recommended R packages in both 32 -bit (i 386) and 64 -bit (amd 64) versions for a number of Ubuntu releases, including the latest two long term service (LTS) releases. Due to changes in hardware availability, the building process for these packages has changed. In this presentation, I will detail how the build process has moved from personal servers to Launchpad, a suite of tools provided by Ubuntu. Launchpad includes the ability to build binary packages for a variety of different architectures and Ubuntu releases. These builds are then synced to CRAN, allowing them to be mirrored on various servers across the world. However, even with the <b>strong</b> <b>packaging</b> system of Ubuntu, {{only a small number of}} the 2, 000 plus R packages are available via CRAN or the main Ubuntu repositories. Installing additional packages can be done within R, but this sometimes requires tracking down the required libraries in Ubuntu. In addition, onc...|$|E

In an effort to maximise the airflow, the front suspension was designed around the twin keel principle, pioneered by Sauber and also used by McLaren and Jordan.|$|R

50|$|On {{economic}} issues, the Socialists {{have often}} been greater advocates of liberal, free market policies than the conservative opposition, which has tended to favor more state interventionism in the economy through economic and price regulations, {{as well as through}} state ownership of key economic enterprises.

According to researchers, the elites of the Hungarian 'left' (MSZP and SZDSZ) have been differentiated from the 'right' by being more supportive of the classical neo-liberal economic policies, while the 'right' (especially extreme right) has advocated more interventionist policies. In contrast, issues like church and state and former communists show alignment along the traditional left-right spectrum. It is also noteworthy that, according to research, the MSZP elite's positions used to be closer to voters of the SZDSZ than to their own.|$|R

The version of record is available on line at doi: [URL] 1073 /pnas. 1420812112 ?? 2015 National Academy of SciencesWe present direct experimental evidence that assembly of a single-stranded RNA virus occurs via a packaging signal-mediated mechanism. We show that the sequences of coat protein recognition motifs within multiple, dispersed, putative RNA packaging signals, {{as well as their}} relative spacing within a genomic fragment, act collectively to influence the fidelity and yield of capsid self-assembly in vitro. These experiments confirm that the selective advantages for viral yield and encapsidation specificity, predicted from previous modeling of packaging signal-mediated assembly, are found in Nature. Regions of the genome that act as packaging signals also function in translational and transcriptional enhancement, as well as directly coding for the coat protein, highlighting {{the density of}} encoded functions within the viral RNA. Assembly and gene expression are therefore direct molecular competitors for different functional folds of the same RNA sequence. The <b>strongest</b> <b>packaging</b> signal in the test fragment, encodes a region of the coat protein that undergoes a conformational change upon contact with packaging signals. A similar phenomenon occurs in other RNA viruses for which packaging signals are known. These contacts hint at an even deeper density of encoded functions in viral RNA, which if confirmed, would have profound consequences for the evolution of this class of pathogen...|$|R

40|$|Alphaviruses {{synthesize}} {{large amounts}} of both genomic and subgenomic RNA in infected cells, but usually only the genomic RNA is packaged. This implies {{the existence of an}} encapsidation or packaging signal which would be responsible for selectivity. Previously, we had identified a region of the Sindbis virus genome that interacts specifically with the viral capsid protein. This 132 -nucleotide (nt) fragment lies within the coding region of the nsP 1 gene (nt 945 to 1076). We proposed that the 132 -mer is important for capsid recognition and initiates the formation of the viral nucleocapsid. To study the encapsidation of Sindbis virus RNAs in infected cells, we designed a new assay that uses the self-replicating Sindbis virus genomes (replicons) which lack the viral structural protein genes and contain heterologous sequences {{under the control of the}} subgenomic RNA promoter. These replicons can be packaged into viral particles by using defective helper RNAs that contain the structural protein genes (P. Bredenbeek, I. Frolov, C. M. Rice, and S. Schlesinger, J. Virol. 67 : 6439 - 6446, 1993). Insertion of the 132 -mer into the subgenomic RNA significantly increased the packaging of this RNA into viral particles. We have used this assay and defective helpers that contain the structural protein genes of Ross River virus (RRV) to investigate the location of the encapsidation signal in the RRV genome. Our results show that there are several fragments that could act as packaging signals. They are all located in a different region of the genome than the signal for the Sindbis virus genome. For RRV, the <b>strongest</b> <b>packaging</b> signal lies between nt 2761 and 3062 in the nsP 2 gene. This is the same region that was proposed to contain the packaging signal for Semliki Forest virus genomic RNA...|$|R
