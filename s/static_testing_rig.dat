The {{negative}} impact of HCF on turbomachinery blades can be reduced by dry friction vibration damping. A typical application of dry friction damping in gas turbine is the so called "underplatform damper". In this work a `real life' asymmetric underplatform damper is experimentally tested with two real blades. A <b>static</b> <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> is used to obtain the nonlinear frequency response function of a mock-up made with two real blades with an underplatform damper between them.

40|$|Rocket engine turbopumps often employ {{rolling element}} {{bearings}} for rotor support. These bearings frequently provide the primary mechanical interface between the stationary and rotating parts, and are relied upon {{to provide an}} adequate stiffness characteristic to ensure small rotor deflection due {{to a variety of}} sources of radial load. The rotordynamic design of a turbopump, however, requires a more detailed understanding of the bearing's load-deflection characteristic, to accurately predict critical speed location and response. Accordingly, engineers have developed tools to predict the load-deflection relationship for rolling element bearings. These tools allow the engineer to account for rolling element bearing geometric parameters as well as operational parameters, many of which have been shown to significantly influence a bearing's force-deflection characteristics. To that end, a <b>static</b> <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> has been designed, built, and tested to experimentally measure the radial stiffness of a rolling element bearing in a realistic mounting configuration.

This work attempts to develop a special <b>static</b> <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> for a component of IKEA’s sliding door system. It {{will be used to}} check the quality of the component in production. The simulation-driven design method will be used in the entire process. Therefore, before proceeding with the details of the <b>test</b> <b>rig,</b> the priority should be given to the simulation.

Four kinds of POM were used to define the model’s material properties. Meanwhile the compression experiment were also conducted. Finite element models were used to predict the load capacity and compare it with the experimental results. The closest prediction in relation to the test results was 2124 N, merely 6 N smaller than the experimental results, giving the proof of a good finite element analysis.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a <b>static</b> <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> called "Octopus" {{designed for the}} validation of numerical models aimed at calculating the nonlinear dynamic response of a bladed disk with underplatform dampers (UPDs). The <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> supports a bladed disk on a fixture and each UPD is pressed against the blade platforms by wires pulled by dead weights. Both excitation system and response measurement system are noncontacting. The paper features the design and the set-up of the noncontacting excitation generated by electromagnets placed under each blade. A travelling wave excitation is generated according to a desired engine order by shifting the phase of the harmonic force of one electromagnet {{with respect to the}} contiguous exciters. Since the friction phenomenon generated by UPDs introduces nonlinearities on the forced response, the amplitude of the exciting force must be kept constant at a known value on every blade during step-sine test to calculate Frequency Response Functions. The issue of the force control is therefore addressed since the performance of the electromagnet changes with frequency. The system calibration procedure and the estimated errors on the generated force are also presented. Examples of experimental tests that can be performed on a dummy integral bladed disk (blisk) mounted on the rig are described in the end...|$|R
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal ISRN Mechanical Engineering. This paper discusses two simplified analytical models for automotive disc brake vibration which can be used to complement more complex finite element methods. The first model approximates the brake disc as a simple beam structure with cyclosymmetric boundary conditions. Since the beam model is a one-dimensional approach, modelling of the inner boundary condition of the brake disc, at the interface of the brake rotor and the central hat, is not possible. The second model, which is established based upon Kirchhoff’s thin plate theory, is presented in this paper in order to incorporate the vibrational deformation at the hat-disc interface. The mode shapes, natural frequencies, and forced response of a static disc are calculated using different inner boundary conditions. Among others, the spring-supported boundary condition is proposed and applied in this paper to make appropriate predictions. The predicted results are compared with measurements of the vibration characteristics of a solid brake disc mounted upon a <b>static</b> <b>test</b> <b>rig.</b> These comparisons demonstrate that the most appropriate model for the inner boundary condition of the measured brake disc is the proposed spring-supported inner boundary condition...|$|R

The work {{has been part of}} a design andexperimental project carried out during the fall of 2012 at GKN Engine System departmentin collaboration with the department of Fluid Dynamics at Chalmers Universityof Technology. The main objective has been to investigate the Box propeller concept feasibilityat an initial experimental stage. To reach the goal a custom propeller <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> havebeen essential to manufacture, which has been the head extensive work of the thesis. The iterative design process has concluded in two rig designs for scale-model testing; aSingle rotor <b>Static</b> <b>test</b> <b>Rig</b> (SSR) and a Dual rotor Dynamic <b>test</b> <b>Rig</b> (DDR). The SSRis of a less complicated design because of its single rotor arrangement and essentiallycommercial of the self instrumentation, which have made it possible to realize the designwithin the given time frame. The SSR process describes the path from rst drawings to CAD models, onwards tomanufacturing and assembling. The rst Box prop tests have now been performed in theSSR and reach over 100 % of the specied speed range measuring net thrust, rotationalspeed together with additional motor parameters to derive propeller torque. The Box propellers were manufactured by two dierent rapid prototype methodsand plastic materials, where the initiating Box-blade design was developed by our thesisintern co worker.

This research was dedicated toward measuring the potential of a new hybrid seal design between a two-bladed PDS and a metal mesh element, which is used as the exit blade of this PDS. The goals were to reduce leakage of the PDS, enhance damping and counteract the negative stiffness of the PDS. To achieve these goals, two sets of experiments namely, the no-air and with-air experiments were conducted on a <b>static</b> <b>test</b> <b>rig.</b> The first set was designed to evaluate the effect of varying the clamping force, the metal mesh density and the amplitude of vibration of the seal journal on the metal mesh dynamic response. The second set was designed to check the effect of varying these three parameters in addition to the effect of varying the inlet pressure to the seal. The performance of the new seal will be evaluated by extracting the rotordynamic coefficients for each experimental setup and compare them to those of the PDS. Two methods were used for extracting the rotordynamic coefficients namely, the classical goo-curve fitting method and a nonlinear regression model. Furthermore, the leakage rate of the new seal was measured for a range of inlet air pressures to evaluate the reduction in the leakage rate...|$|R

There are many types of propellant such as nitrogen tetroxide and hydrazine but most of them are toxic in nature and can harm our health and environment. This has increased the renewed interest on hydrogen peroxide, also known as “green” propellant that can act as monopropellant or oxidizer which is ideal for spacecraft programs. This research is mainly about developing a rocket thruster by using hydrogen peroxide as monopropellant. Therefore, a 10 Newton rocket thruster has been designed and fabricated. However, in order to test the performance of rocket thruster, there are several preparations that have been done. Firstly, was the preparation of rocket grade hydrogen peroxide (concentration > 85 %) from lower concentration of hydrogen peroxide. Next, was development of rocket test facility which consists of two integral parts; (1) <b>static</b> <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> and (2) data acquisition system. Measuring discharge coefficient of the thruster injector was also part of the preparations to ensure the mass flow rate of propellant. Finally, the catalyst pack was prepared where silver screens were used as catalyzer. The hydrogen peroxide would react with the catalyst pack and decompose into water and oxygen. In order to identify the optimum configuration of producing 10 N thrust, several parameters were taken into consideration and they are injector orifice diameter, nozzle throat diameter, type of hydrogen peroxide used, catalyst pack length, compaction pressure of catalyst pack, engine heating temperature and propellant injection pressure. With a total of 5 series of successful hot tests, the optimum configuration of producing 10 N thrust using hydrogen peroxide monopropellant rocket thruster had been achieved.

These ducts possess cross-sectional shape transitions, from oblate to circular, with area increase and annular ducts at the engine face. The work was aimed at both fundamental understanding of the flows and at establishing test data for the prediction methods. Tests were performed at throat Mach numbers of nominally 0. 15 and 0. 6 and in the unit Reynolds number range of 3 x 10 _ 6 /m - 2 x 10 _ 7 /m for three different ducts each having different upstream bends but common downstream bends.

For the most extreme case large regions of complex three-dimensional separated flow occur and topological analysis of the recorded surface oil flow pattern allows reconstruction of the separating flow.

The <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> allows multi-axial <b>static</b> and dynamic loading of a rolling element bearing. Different types and sizes of bearings can be mounted and loaded as if built into a real machine. The <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> {{will be used to}} analyse the effect of external dynamic loads on the lifetime of these bearings. The dynamics of the <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> were analysed during {{the design and}} validated afterwards. It is proved that the bearings can be excited in the range from 25 to 440 Hz, free from resonances of the <b>test</b> <b>rig.</b> Also, several measures were taken to guarantee precise measurements of the bearing’s axial, radial and tilt motion. In this way, accurately measuring the bearing behaviour while applying a fully controlled dynamic load is the key feature of the <b>test</b> <b>rig.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{swingarm}} of {{a motorcycle}} {{is an important}} component of its suspension. In order to test the durability of swingarms, a dedicated <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> was designed and realized. The <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> was designed to load the swingarm in the same way the swingarm is loaded on the test track. The research report structure is as follows: relevant literature related to automotive component testing, current swingarm <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> models and composite swingarms were outlined. The Leyni bench, a rig specifically developed by Ducati to test swingarm reliability was shown to be effective but lacked the ability to apply variable loads. The objective of this research was to design and experimentally validate a swingarm <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> to evaluate swingarm performance at different loads. The methodology, the components of the <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> and the instrumentation required to achieve the objectives of the research were presented. The elastic modulus of the carbon fibre swingarm material was calculated using classical laminate theory. The strains and stresses within a swingarm during testing were analysed. The <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> was shown to be versatile, accurate and efficient, with potential for future application. This research has shown the benefit of <b>test</b> <b>rigs</b> for <b>testing</b> motorcycle components...|$|R
