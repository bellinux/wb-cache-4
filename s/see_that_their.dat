5|$|The video {{starts at}} the Clarksons' household. There, {{she and her husband}} are engaged in a heated {{argument}} and he threatens to smash down a picture of the family at one point. Time freezes still and her husband becomes immobile; Clarkson, however, is immune to this. Looking around her house, she sees her younger self. Hand in hand, the younger and older versions of Clarkson relive her troubled childhood as various painful memories are seen, such as the younger Clarkson making a picture for her father who tosses it into the sink while talking on the phone, and Clarkson's mother making an unappreciated dinner for her father as she puts the father's dinner into the bin. These events drive her mother to the point of taking pills before closing the door in the younger Clarkson's face, so that she doesn't see her starting to cry. The breaking point is finally seen when Clarkson's parents have a physical fight and throw objects at each other. Soon after, Clarkson's father packs his bags and leaves despite the younger Clarkson's pleas for him to stay. The older Clarkson runs back in time to the present, and instead of fighting with her husband, they make up. They then <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> daughter in the video had seen them fight, and they embrace her and each other. Throughout the music video, Clarkson is shown singing on the front porch, her mother's bed and a room full of mirrors, reflecting an image of her younger self. Note that Kelly is holding Kennedy's hand in the scene where the childhood memories are revealed.|$|E

During that time, he did have some problems with his brother Vince who was shown displeased with what happened at Cobra Pharmaceuticals and stated that their parents are in doubt about what happened. After Duke saves his parents and reunites with the other Joes, they arrive at the Hauser household where Connie wanted to treat them to a meal. Unfortunately, Vince had called Flint after he had warned Duke to stay away. Duke ends up defending his actions towards the other Joes and tells Flint upon the group's arrest to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> families are protected.|$|E

25|$|In August 1882 Wood {{commanded}} the 4th Brigade on the Egyptian expedition {{to suppress the}} Urabi Revolt. Wolseley kept him on occupation duties in Alexandria, so he missed the Battle of Tel el-Kebir. He returned to Chatham for a while again in November 1882 then returned to be Sirdar (commander) of the Egyptian Army from 21 December 1882 until 1885, during which period he thoroughly reorganised it, with Francis Grenfell and Kitchener working under him. He had 25 British officers (who were given extra pay and Egyptian ranks a grade or two higher than their British ones) and a few NCOs, although to Wood’s annoyance Lt-Gen Stephenson, commander of the British occupation forces, was confirmed as his senior in June 1884. During the cholera epidemic of 1883, British officers earned the respect of Egyptian soldiers by nursing them. Wood gave Sundays off from drill as well as Fridays (the Muslim holy day), so that Egyptian soldiers would <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> British officers took their own religion seriously.|$|E
25|$|After {{the protagonist}} {{receives}} his second tattoo, he and Ora are tasked to {{take revenge on}} the PMCs responsible for {{the attack on the}} dojo: a corporation called Hessian, run by a ruthless Eastern European plutocrat named Count Karajan. Meanwhile, the horishi artist Dosan expresses concern over the tattoo ink's quality and promises to learn why Azai has not procured a fresh supply. The protagonist invades Hessian's East Asian regional headquarters and murders Corporal Kelly, the Hessian employee who lead the attack on the dojo, and, using a stolen GPS tracking unit, stalks Karajan to his castle in Eastern Europe and slays him. Upon returning home, the protagonist and Ora <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> clan has stolen a great deal of high tech military equipment from Hessian, leaving them to realize that Azai's plan had been to rob Karajan and replace the old Hisomu Path with a modern, technological approach to espionage. Instead of committing seppuku, the protagonist flees with Ora to find Dosan, who had left a message indicating that he had personally gone in search of the mysterious desert flower.|$|E

He shot the teenage characters slightly below eye level to create the impression of looking up at an adult, and shot the adults slightly above eye level as if the viewer were looking down at a child. He said that hypocrisy was [...] "at the top of the list" [...] of the themes he wanted to explore in the story. While all of the adults in the film are attempting to live perfect lives, they cannot <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> children are driven to suicide, antidepressant addiction and kidnapping [...] for instance, Terri is so obsessed with her upcoming wedding that she does not realize her son is missing.|$|E

500|$|Conference {{notes and}} draft {{decisions}} illustrate {{the division of}} opinions before the decision was issued. Justices Douglas, Black, Burton, and Minton were predisposed to overturn Plessy. Fred M. Vinson noted that Congress had not issued desegregation legislation; Stanley F. Reed discussed incomplete cultural assimilation and states' rights and was inclined {{to the view that}} segregation worked to the benefit of the African-American community; Tom C. Clark wrote that [...] "we had led the states on to think segregation is OK and we should let them work it out." [...] Felix Frankfurter and Robert H. Jackson disapproved of segregation, but were also opposed to judicial activism and expressed concerns about the proposed decision's enforceability. Chief Justice Vinson had been a key stumbling block. After Vinson died in September 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Earl Warren as Chief Justice. Warren had supported the integration of Mexican-American students in California school systems following Mendez v. Westminster. However, Eisenhower invited Earl Warren to a White House dinner, where the president told him: [...] "These [...] are not bad people. All they are concerned about is to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> sweet little girls are not required to sit in school alongside some big overgrown Negroes." [...] Nevertheless, the Justice Department sided with the African American plaintiffs.|$|E

2500|$|People seldom find {{absolutely}} {{natural environments}} on Earth, and naturalness usually varies in a continuum, from [...] 100% natural in one extreme to 0% natural in the other.

2500|$|Nixon secured an easy primary victory: 1,285,151 votes (65.4 percent) to Shell's 656,542 (33.4 percent), {{but he did}} not {{immediately}} consult Shell to seek rapprochement with the conservative wing of the party. Thereafter, he declared that [...] "those who have supported Joe Shell will <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> differences with me are infinitesimal compared with their differences with Brown." [...] Shell first demanded that Nixon agree to trim state spending by at least $200 million (then 7 percent of the state budget) and to [...] "espouse conservatism" [...] as the price of his endorsement. He asked to be able to name a third of the delegates to the next national convention and to name the party's vice-chairman. When a considerable number of Shell's Assembly colleagues objected to the demands that he imposed on the basis of having polled only a third of the primary vote, Shell relented and agreed to endorse Nixon and the entire Republican ticket, including Senator Kuchel.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, Judt was a {{historian}} of modern France.

[...] In Past Imperfect: French Intellectuals, 1944–1956, Judt moved away both from social history towards intellectual history, and from the endorsement of French Marxist traditions to their critique. [...] In Past Imperfect, he castigated French intellectuals of the postwar era, above all Jean-Paul Sartre for their [...] "self-imposed moral amnesia". Judt criticized what he considered blind faith in Joseph Stalin's communism. In Judt's reading, French thinkers such as Jean-Paul Sartre were blinded by their own provincialism, and unable to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> calls for intellectual authenticity should have required them to interrogate their own attachment to communism and criticize the Soviet Union for its policies in postwar eastern Europe. [...] This was in some sense a criticism from within, using French sources and polemical style against famous French intellectuals. Judt made a similar case in some of his more popular writings. [...] For instance, following the recognition by then President Jacques Chirac, in 1995, of the responsibility of the French state during the Collaboration, on the anniversary of the Vel' d'Hiv raid, he claimed in an op-ed published by The New York Times that: ...|$|E

It can be <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> magnitudes are related to the dip angles regardless of the dip length, but their frequencies are not related to either dip angles or dip lengths. Therefore, the relationship between the accelerations on a locomotive component and the dip angles of dipped rail defects is important for monitoring the development of those defects.|$|R
