This new agenda challenges the traditional Itno army" policy of Costa Kica. Following a brief historical overview of the traditional policy, the paper considers the role of specific factors that promote structural conduciveness for the new "defense" policy and the attendant transformation of political <b>symbols</b> <b>and</b> <b>definitions.</b> The impact of the definitional and organizational changes on the implementation stage of policy is explored.

This approach aims at addressing the issues in object-oriented testing, especially for unit testing. A set of new <b>symbols</b> <b>and</b> <b>definitions</b> {{have been developed to}} capture the unit structure in object-oriented system. Rules and algorithms have been developed to guide test case generation. New methods are proposed to represent various relationships in object-oriented systems. The applicability of the {{new approach}} has been discussed for different type of classes. A modeling framework has been setup.

40|$|The first {{system that}} allows visual logic to be {{captured}} to dramatically reduce the development time of complex, large-scale, mixed-language software systems. This revolutionary new capability provides a simple visualization of both model and language to reduce bugs and dramatically improve software quality. This paper describes the Powware ™ Visual Programming Language ™ and underlying technology. It discusses {{a brief history of}} programming languages in general, a brief history of visual programming languages to date, and the externally visible features of Powware ™ Visual Programming Language™ via a simple example. This paper describes how this language uses two dimensional elements, unlike character-based predecessors, to model the syntax of the grammar as an ordered collection of symbols or shapes connected as directed graphs. Due to this graphical nature, the language circumscribes the concept of abstract syntactic pattern recognition. This pattern recognition is rooted in the development of spatial parsers, like its character-based counterparts. This methodology is better than representing yet another character-based language because it allows the structure of a program to be manipulated graphically, and references to <b>symbols</b> <b>and</b> <b>definitions</b> to be selected by natural input devices, such as speech, pen, or even a mouse, rather than reentered via discrete keyboard strokes...|$|E
40|$|Trying to {{decompose}} an integer into {{a product of}} integers, we feel irritation. There should dwell the reason why any prime appears like a real gem that one can touch and hold. We thus muse ever and again how and when ancient people discovered the way of sifting out primes and began appreciating them. Perhaps those who conceived the divisibility had already some sieves in their minds. Indeed, a wealth of evidences have been excavated supporting our view. The story to be told below must have originated more than five millennia ago 1), while the primordial intellectual irritation has remained fresh and fundamental till today. The history of Sieve Method is rich and fascinating; we would need a volume to exhaust the story. In the present article we shall instead concentrate onto several pivotal ideas that made the progress possible; so the scope is inevitably limited. Nevertheless, you will encounter instances of precious mathematical achievements {{that people in the}} future will certainly continue to relate.

50|$|Rather than {{functioning}} through <b>symbol</b> <b>and</b> meaning, this <b>definition</b> of ornament positions {{the function}} of ornament through a built form’s affects and therefore their actual aesthetic experience. Unlike symbolic definitions of ornament, which are rooted in a unified concept of society, Moussavi's definition of ornament argues that in a contemporary plural society - which lacks shared image-memories - the non-representational nature of affects allows built forms to be perceived by everyone but differently, making allowance for different subjectivities. This enables the built environment, like movies, music and art, {{to act as a}} common social fabric.|$|R
30|$|Consistent {{use of a}} given locus identifier, full gene name, <b>and</b> gene <b>symbol</b> is suggested. Consistency can be {{maintained}} {{as long as there}} are no major changes in the gene model or function, particularly no changes that would lead to a change in the start position of the locus. For example, consistency of nomenclature is possible in cases where the gene encodes an ORF, and the modifications in annotation change only the intron–exon boundaries, the strand identity, require the addition or deletion of exon(s) or intron(s), or change or modify the function or associated phenotype assigned to the locus. Similarly, in cases where updated annotation changes the definition of the ORF, the gene’s full name, <b>symbol,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>definition</b> line of the GenBank/DDBJ/EMBL records should reflect the change in the molecule’s structure or function, but in all of the above cases, the locus ID remains same.|$|R
