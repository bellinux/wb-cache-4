We first review a range of physical-layer attacks in CR networks, including the primary user emulation, sensing falsification, intelligence compromise, jamming and eavesdropping attacks. Then {{we focus on the}} physical-layer security of CR networks against eavesdropping and examine the <b>secrecy</b> performance <b>of</b> cognitive <b>communications</b> in terms <b>of</b> <b>secrecy</b> outage probability. We further consider the use of relays for improving the CR security against eavesdropping and propose an opportunistic relaying scheme, where a relay node that makes CR communications most resistant to eavesdropping is chosen to participate in assisting the transmission from a cognitive source to its destination. It is illustrated that the physical-layer <b>secrecy</b> <b>of</b> CR <b>communications</b> relying on the opportunistic relaying can be significantly improved by increasing the number of relays, showing the security benefit of exploiting relay nodes. Finally, we present some open challenges in the field of relays assisted physical-layer security for CR networks. Comment: 15 pages in IEEE Communications Magazine, September 201...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Long {{distance}} communication using electronic media {{is prone to}} unwanted interception just rather more than the communication over traditional channels was. While the traditional communication systems were insecure, it was rather more difficult to intercept communication without the communicating parties realizing that someone has seen the written message, due to either the tampering of the seal proof cover, or harm to the courier carrier person. But digital messages move over the Internet or the telephonic communication channels using store and forward techniques. Hence the message can be copied at any intermediate node without anyone getting any the wiser. The message, once inserted into the shared channel, is open to all, and completely insecure. Hence {{it is necessary to}} ensure that it won’t be understood by unwanted persons on the way. Cryptography and steganography approaches try to achieve this. Security of the messages in transit includes confidentiality, integrity, authentication and non-repudiation. In this paper, we study various algorithms developed towards ensuring security <b>of</b> <b>communications.</b> When people initially tried to communicate over distances, they tried to ensure the <b>secrecy</b> <b>of</b> their <b>communications.</b> The technologies <b>of</b> Cryptography and Steganography developed for this objective. The word Cryptography evolved from two Greek words – Crypto (hidden, secret); and Graphein (writing). Initially cryptography was done for just confidentiality, which was ensured by encryption.

40|$|This paper clarifies {{the extent}} of government's {{authorized}} access to information on cell phones and similar communications terminal devices under Paragraph 2 ，Article 21 of the Constitution of Japan, which protects the “secrecy of any means of communication．” This paper considers the U. S. standard that was established by the 2014 decision, Riley v. California. In this case, {{it was decided that}} the police must obtain a search warrant before they access the digital data on a cell phone seized from a person who has been arrested. The U. S. Court decided that it would be unreasonable to allow a search without a warrant, since the amount and variety of information on a cell phone often are enough that the police are able to reconstruct much of the suspect's private life. The U. S. Court also held that {{the extent of}} a warrantless “search incident to an arrest” is limited {{in the sense that it}} is allowed to find hidden weapons or prevent the destruction of evidence, and that this doctrine does not allow warrantless searches of cell phone data after an arrest. However, it does not fully explain the difference in the relevance to privacy between data on communications terminal devices and those on other devices or commodities. In Japan, Constitutional rights for <b>secrecy</b> <b>of</b> <b>communications</b> do not, in principle allow the police to implement a warrantless “search incident to arrest” to the content of communications terminal devices including a cell phone or any other communications facilities, regardless of its relevancy to privacy. This norm strongly protects communications users by preventing the police or other governmental agencies from having voluntary access to the communications terminal devices and data on them. It is thus concluded that the <b>secrecy</b> <b>of</b> <b>communications</b> plays an important role to distinguish data on communications terminal devices from those on other devices in terms of the extent of Constitutional protection. 長崎大学経済学部創立 110 周年記念論文集Essays in Commemoration of the 110 th Anniversary of the Faculty of Economics, Nagasaki Universit...|$|E

This paper develops a secure implementation of a typed pi calculus, in which type capabilities are employed to realize the policies for the access to communication channels. Our implementation translates the typed capabilities of the high-level calculi into corresponding term capabilities protected by encryption keys only known to the intended receivers. As such, the implementation is effective even in the presence of open contexts for which no assumption on trust and behavior may be made. Our technique and results draw on, and extend, previous work [3] on secure implementation of channel abstractions in a dialect of the join calculus.

40|$|The <b>secrecy</b> {{capacity}} <b>of</b> relay <b>communications</b> is {{investigated in}} this paper, where an eavesdropper is present. Distributed precoding through multiple relay nodes {{can be used}} to enhance the received signal power at the destination node and to mitigate the signal leakage to the eavesdropper, simultaneously. Due to individual power constraints at relay nodes, the distributed precoding scalar at each relay node is equivalent to a distributed precoding angle. An iterative algorithm is proposed to find the suboptimum distributed precoding angles at all the relay nodes, where the channel state information (CSI) sharing overhead among the relay nodes can also be substantially reduced. Each relay node receives the equivalent CSI from its preceding relay node, computes its distributed precoding angle, and updates the equivalent CSI for the next relay node. Compared with the simple decode-and-forward relaying protocol with random distributed precoding, the proposed iterative distributed precoding algorithm is able to further improve on the <b>secrecy</b> capacity <b>of</b> the multirelay wiretap system with an acceptable CSI sharing overhead...|$|R

We firstly investigate the PLA based secure communications for point-to-point wireless systems {{from the perspectives of}} both total power minimization and secrecy rate maximization. We then take a step further to apply the PLA based secure beamforming designs to relaying networks. The secrecy rate maximization for relaying networks is discussed in detail under both the perfect channel state information and the polarization sensitive array pointing error. In the later case, a robust scheme to achieve secure communications for relaying networks is proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed PLA based algorithms achieve lower total power consumption and better security performance compared with the conventional scalar array designs, especially under challenging environments where all received signals at destination are difficult to be distinguished from the spatial domain.

In this study CLSM – Couple Layered Security Model is suggested which has a hybrid structure enhancing information security using features of cryptography and steganography. In CLSM system; the information which has been initially cryptographically encrypted is steganographically embedded in an image at the next step. The information is encrypted {{by means of a}} Text Keyword consisting of maximum 16 digits determined by the user in cryptography method.

40|$|The {{growth of}} {{wireless}} networks has been considerable {{over the last}} decades. Due to the broadcast nature of these networks, security issues have taken {{a critical role in}} today’s communications. A promising direction towards achieving secure communications is information theoretic secrecy, which is an approach exploiting the randomness of the channels to ensure secrecy. Based on this approach, there has been a recent surge of interest in a potential cooperation between users to enhance the <b>secrecy</b> <b>of</b> <b>communications.</b> In this thesis we investigate the interaction between cooperation and secrecy. In particular the contributions of the thesis can be divided into two parts. In the first part, we study cooperative strategies for secrecy for wireless channels. Our goal is to evaluate the effect of fading and limited CSI on the eavesdropper’s channels. In that purpose we consider a scenario where a helper aims at increasing the secrecy of the communication between a source and destination in the presence of an eavesdropper. Several strategies are discussed for the helper, namely decode-and-forward, amplify-and-forward, and cooperative jamming. We introduce the secrecy outage probability, the conditional secrecy outage probability and the secure throughput as secrecy measures. For each measure, we investigate and compare the secrecy performance of cooperation. We furthermore elaborate a system optimization in terms of strategy selection, node positioning, power allocation and rate design. In the second part, we consider cooperation in the 4 -node scenario against a more sophisticated adversary: an active eavesdropper, which can either passively eavesdrop, or jam the transmission. A game-theoretic perspective is a natural way to analyze the competitive interaction between the helper and the eavesdropper. Therefore we define several secrecy games, for which we find the Nash and Stackelberg equilibria as well as the corresponding secrecy rate outcomes. Another important consideration in this scenario is the interaction between the source and the helper, which we model and solve as a Stackelberg game, and we illustrate its impact on the achievable secrecy rates.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{exchange}} secret information {{is critical to}} many commercial, governmental, and military networks. Information-theoretic security - widely accepted as the strictest notion of security - relies on channel coding techniques that exploit the inherent randomness of the propagation channels to significantly strengthen the security of digital communications systems. Motivated by recent developments in the field, this thesis aims at a characterization of the fundamental secrecy limits of large-scale wireless networks. We start by introducing an information-theoretic definition of the intrinsically secure communications graph (iS-graph), based {{on the notion of}} strong secrecy. The iS-graph is a random geometric graph which captures the connections that can be securely established over a large-scale network, in the presence of spatially scattered eavesdroppers. Using fundamental tools from stochastic geometry, we analyze how the spatial densities of legitimate and eavesdropper nodes influence various properties of the Poisson iS-graph, such as the distribution of node degrees, the node isolation probabilities, and the achievable secrecy rates. We study how the wireless propagation effects (e. g., fading and shadowing) and eavesdropper collusion affect the secrecy properties of the network. We also explore the potential of sectorized transmission and eavesdropper neutralization as two techniques for enhancing the <b>secrecy</b> <b>of</b> <b>communications.</b> We then shift our focus to the global properties of the iS-graph, which concern secure connectivity over multiple hops. We first characterize percolation of the Poisson iS-graph on the infinite plane. We show that each of the four components of the iS-graph (in, out, weak, and strong component) experiences a phase transition at some nontrivial critical density of legitimate nodes. Operationally, this is important because it implies that long-range communication over multiple hops is still feasible when a security constraint is present. We then consider full-connectivity on a finite region of the Poisson iS-graph. Specifically, we derive simple, explicit expressions that closely approximate the probability of a node being securely connected to all other nodes inside the region. We also show that the iS-graph is asymptotically fully out-connected with probability one, but full in-connectivity remains bounded away from one, no matter how large the density of legitimate nodes is made. Our results clarify how the spatial density of eavesdroppers can compromise the intrinsic security of wireless networks. We are hopeful that further efforts in combining stochastic geometry with information-theoretic principles will lead to a more comprehensive treatment of wireless security. by Pedro C. Pinto.
