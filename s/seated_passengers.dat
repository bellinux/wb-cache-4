5|$|The company bought five bogie trams. They {{had pointed}} ends to ease meeting the shorter trams in the city, {{and had a}} low-floor center section, with {{internal}} steps. The body and mechanical equipment was built by Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk, while the electrical components were built by Siemens-Schuckertwerke. Capacity was for 40 or 38 <b>seated</b> <b>passengers.</b> In early 1917, Barth was replaced by H. A. Mørk as director. Trial runs of the tramway started on 11 June 1917. It was retrospectively decided by the ministry that the official opening date was 1 July.|$|E
25|$|On curves {{the outer}} rail {{may be at}} a higher level than the inner rail. This is called {{superelevation}} or cant. This reduces the forces tending to displace the track and makes for a more comfortable ride for standing livestock and standing or <b>seated</b> <b>passengers.</b> A given amount of superelevation is most effective over a limited range of speeds.|$|E

40|$|Objective : To {{evaluate}} {{patterns of}} {{morbidity and mortality}} among bike riders and pillion <b>seat</b> <b>passengers</b> involved in road traffic accidents in Benin-City Nigeria between August 2003 -July 2004. Methods : A total of Fifty-one bike riders and pillion <b>seat</b> <b>passengers,</b> who participated in this study were part of a larger study, involved in a road traffic accident and were brought to the accident and emergency unit of either the University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH) or the State Specialist Hospital between August 2002 -July 2003. The injured ones were examined and dead patients had an autopsy done on them Results : A total of 51 cases of bikes riders/pillion <b>seat</b> <b>passenger</b> accidents were recorded representing 18 &#x 0025; of total accidents. 35 motorbike riders/pillion <b>seat</b> <b>passengers</b> were struck down by cars (68. 6 &#x 0025;). Seven bike riders/pillion <b>seat</b> <b>passengers</b> (13. 5 &#x 0025;) were struck by articulated vehicles. 7 bike riders/pillion <b>seat</b> <b>passengers</b> representing 13. 5 &#x 0025; of cases were stuck by buses, 2 (3. 9 &#x 0025;) pillion <b>seat</b> <b>passengers</b> fell of bikes from epilepsies and sustained secondary injuries.

25|$|In the {{original}} interior layout {{with a separate}} conductor and driver the HM V trams had capacity of 29 <b>seated</b> <b>passengers</b> and 69 standing passengers. During the rush hour this could be exceeded by an additional 50 standing passengers. On conversion to one-person operation during the late 1970s and early 80s, the conductor's seat was replaced with two additional seats, bringing the seating capacity up to 31, while the standing capacity was downsized to 57 plus an additional 44 during the rush hour. Following conversion into the Spårakoff, tram number 175 (ex-15) has a capacity of 24 all-seated passengers.|$|E
25|$|The Newark Light Rail {{system uses}} a new-model vehicle built by Kinki Sharyo of Japan. This vehicle, {{the same one}} used by the HBLR system, is a double-articulated vehicle with three {{sections}}. Each of the two end sections has an operator's cab at the far end, thus {{eliminating the need for}} the vehicle to turn itself around physically in order to reverse direction. Each end section also has seating for 16 passengers on an upper level, and seating for 13 passengers on the lower level, including one special fold-down seat next to an empty space that a passenger using a wheelchair may use. With these two sections, and a middle section that seats ten passengers (five on each side), the vehicle can comfortably accommodate 68 <b>seated</b> <b>passengers</b> and two wheelchairs. An additional 122 passengers could stand in the vehicle, if necessary. Vehicles can be coupled into two-unit sets. A contract to expand 10 of the 20 LRVs assigned to the Newark Light Rail system for the purpose of increasing passenger capacity was approved on July 9, 2014.|$|E

The four-car trains were modifications of Class 71, which was again based on the Swedish X2. The A-series consists of 16 intercity trains; they were delivered in 1999 and 2000 and are used on the Bergen, Dovre and Sørland Lines. The intercity service was branded as Signatur until 2003. The B-series consists of six regional trains delivered in 2002 and used on the Østfold Line. The regional trains were originally part of the Agenda concept. The trains have a power output of [...] and a maximum speed of [...] They have an overall length of [...] and have a capacity for 208 <b>seated</b> <b>passengers</b> in the A-series and 250 in the B-series.

500|$|The A-series has a {{capacity}} of 207 <b>seated</b> <b>passengers,</b> while the B-series has room for 250. The difference {{is due to the}} B-series having a smaller bistro and more compact seating. In the A-series, each of the four cars has seating in a different color (blue in BFM73 car, green in BMU73, red in BFR73, and yellow leather in BM73 and in the bistro area in BFR73). Originally, three of the cars had floors with carpet, while the fourth car (BFM73) had vinyl, of consideration to people with allergies. The carpets were removed in about 2005 as it was difficult to keep them clean. Seating is in two classes, standard and Komfort (originally [...] "Plus"); the latter (BM73 car) with leather seating and power supply for laptops. All the cars have cherry tree wood interior. The trains are equipped with a dining section (BFR73 car) and warm meals can be served at the seat or in the diner. The menu is according to the time of day, with breakfasts in the morning and larger meals in the afternoon and evening. The trains also feature a family section with a play area and HC area (BFM73 car). The BFM73 car has also a bicycle room behind the driver's cab. From 2011, the trains are equipped with free wireless Internet.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} pattern of {{injuries}} to front and rear seat occupants and test the hypothesis that rear <b>seat</b> <b>passengers</b> of different ages sustain different patterns of injury. Method: Patients admitted to a hospital following involvement in a crash in New South Wales (NSW) Australia between 2005 and 2007 were identified using International Classification of Diseases (10 th edition [ICD 10]) codes. Hospital admissions data were linked with NSW police crash data using probabilistic techniques. The profiles and patterns of injury of front and rear <b>seat</b> <b>passengers</b> were compared. Logistic regression {{was used to examine}} how age influenced {{the pattern of}} injury among rear <b>seat</b> <b>passengers.</b> Results: Sixty-three percent of hospital admissions were linked with police records. One in 5 <b>passengers</b> were rear <b>seat</b> <b>passengers.</b> There were more unrestrained occupants in the rear (7 %) compared to drivers (3 %) and front <b>seat</b> <b>passengers</b> (2 %). Younger (9 - 15 years) injured <b>passengers</b> were <b>seated</b> in the rear more often than in the front passenger position and older injured passengers (> 50 years) were seated more often in the front passenger position than in the rear (15 % rear compared to 5 % front aged 9 - 15 years; 22 % rear compared to 37 % front aged > 50 years; χ 2, P 50 years) rear passengers had 6. 3 times the odds of sustaining thoracic injuries (95 % confidence interval [CI], 2. 6 - 15. 0) and lower odds (odds ratio [OR] = 0. 4, 95 % CI, 0. 2 - 0. 9) of sustaining abdominal/lumbar injuries than the youngest occupants (9 - 15 years). The odds of sustaining a head injury did not vary with age, and the odds of sustaining thoracic, abdominal, or lower extremity injuries did not differ significantly between rear <b>seat</b> <b>passengers</b> aged 16 - 50 years and 9 - 15 years. Conclusions: The findings suggest {{that there is a need}} for enhanced protection for rear <b>seat</b> <b>passengers,</b> because they have proportionally more fatal injuries than front-seated occupants. The frequency of abdominal injury and the differences between injury patterns observed in front <b>seat</b> <b>passengers</b> suggests a potential benefit from adding abdominal injury risk assessment to rear seat occupant protection test protocols.
