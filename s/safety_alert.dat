Alert overriding may often be justified and adverse drug events due to overridden alerts are not always preventable. A distinction between appropriate and useful alerts should be made. The alerting system may contain error-producing conditions like low specificity, low sensitivity, unclear information content, unnecessary workflow disruptions, and unsafe and inefficient handling. These may result in active failures of the physician, like ignoring alerts, misinterpretation, and incorrect handling.

The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the impact of rosiglitazone <b>safety</b> <b>alerts</b> on trends in the sale of rosiglitazone and other oral antidiabetic drugs. An ecological study was conducted, using temporally aggregated data and linking <b>safety</b> <b>alerts</b> to countrywide sales of all oral antidiabetic drugs in Portugal from January 2002 to December 2012. Sales figures for oral antidiabetic drugs marketed in Portugal were supplied by IMS Health Portugal with a breakdown by active substance and fixed combinations. The number of defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants per day (DIDs) of each oral antidiabetic drug sold to the estimated diabetic population using oral antidiabetic drugs in Portugal was calculated. Particular attention was paid to the case of rosiglitazone, with the results being adjusted for changes in rosiglitazone reimbursement policies. A total of four <b>safety</b> <b>alerts</b> were issued about rosiglitazone. Rosiglitazone sales registered an increase of 32. 9 % (0. 202 DIDs; P 0. 05) and 0. 24 % (- 0. 001 DIDs; P > 0. 05), respectively.

40|$|Computerized {{physician}} {{order entry}} systems (CPOEs) usually generate drug <b>safety</b> <b>alerts</b> to remind physicians to potentially unsafe situations. However, physicians may feel overwhelmed by {{high numbers of}} alerts that are not patient-tailored and they may consequently suffer from alert fatigue. Alert fatigue is the mental state that {{is the result of}} alerts consuming too much time and mental energy, which can cause relevant alerts to be unjustifiably overridden along with clinically irrelevant ones. Reasonâ?Ts model of accident causation helps to understand how a drug <b>safety</b> <b>alerting</b> system meant to reduce medication errors may provoke them. Low specificity, unclear alert information, unnecessary workflow disruptions and unsafe and inefficient alert handling add to the risk of <b>alert</b> fatigue. Drug <b>safety</b> <b>alerts</b> were overridden in 90 % of cases and physicians often justified overriding by using incorrect rules or rules not applicable to the situation. A newly developed comprehensive test showed widely varying quality of drug <b>safety</b> <b>alerting</b> in Dutch hospital CPOEs. Counteracting alert fatigue appeared to be difficult. Turning off frequently overridden alerts hospital-wide was not feasible because of within-hospital differences in drug-related knowledge and routine monitoring practices. Levels of seriousness added to the alert text were perceived helpful but resulted in increased override rates. Directing alerts with respect to drug administration times to nurses was not accepted by the ward management. Preferred alert handling was hampered often because of low specificity, unclear alert recommendations and inefficient handling. This research generated unexpected results as well as insights how to improve drug <b>safety</b> <b>alerting</b> in CPOE...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Gastrointestinal bleedings are {{the most}} {{frequently}} occurring reason for medication-related hospital admissions, which are potentially preventable. We implemented a {{clinical decision support system}} that recommends to prescribe gastrointestinal prophylaxis in patients with an increased risk according to the Dutch guideline. Our primary objective was to determine whether the implementation resulted in improved compliance with this guideline for gastrointestinal prophylaxis. A secondary objective was to determine whether implementation resulted in a reduction of the number of drug <b>safety</b> <b>alerts.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: This intervention study was performed at the Spaarne Gasthuis, a teaching hospital, using Epic as hospital information system. We selected prescriptions with an indication for gastrointestinal prophylaxis according to the guideline, in the three months before and after implementation of the clinical decision support in November 2014. We analyzed whether gastrointestinal prophylaxis was prescribed more frequently after implementation using the Pearson's Chi-square test and the change in the number of drug <b>safety</b> <b>alerts.</b> RESULTS: Before implementation in 84. 0 % of the included 2064 prescriptions gastrointestinal prophylaxis was co-prescribed. After implementation this percentage increased to 94. 5 % of the 2269 prescriptions (p< 0. 001). The number of drug <b>safety</b> <b>alerts</b> decreased by 78. 2 % from 980 to 217 alerts. CONCLUSION: The introduction of a clinical decision support system for gastrointestinal prophylaxis improved adherence to the Dutch guideline. This was most likely due to a {{reduction in the number of}} irrelevant drug <b>safety</b> <b>alerts...</b>|$|R

40|$|Aim. This {{paper is}} a report of a study to {{determine}} whether action required by patient <b>safety</b> <b>alerts</b> was effectively taken. Background. Over the last 10 years, {{there has been a}} growing awareness of the number of patients unintentionally harmed {{in the course of their}} treatment. <b>Safety</b> <b>alerts</b> are designed to reduce the incidence of adverse events by removing these predisposing factors. Method. A multi-method study was carried out in 20 acute, two mental health, four ambulance and 15 primary care provider organizations in the United Kingdom in 2006 – 2007 using surveys, interviews with senior managers and front-line staff, collection of documentary evidence and equipment audit. The implementation of three <b>safety</b> <b>alerts</b> for nursing action is reported. Findings. Most staff were aware of the dangers posed by gloves to staff with latex allergy, but only 20 % were aware of the types of common equipment that posed a danger to sensitive patients. Almost 40 % of nurses were unable to give a correct acidity value to allow nasogastric feeding to commence. One alert, on needle-free intravascular connectors, was distributed in only a few organizations as the term used was unfamiliar at all levels of the organization. Conclusion. Healthcare providers have succeeded in setting up successful systems to disseminate alerts to middle management level, but there is evidence that implementation of recommendations by nurses is sub-optimal...|$|R

40|$|Background: One {{possible}} approach towards avoiding alert overload {{and alert}} fatigue in Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE) systems is to tailor their drug <b>safety</b> <b>alerts</b> to {{the context of}} the clinical situation.

Results: The 223 participants identified the 'severity of the effect' and the 'clinical status of the patient' as the most useful context factors. Further important factors are the 'complexity of the case' and the 'risk factors of the patient'. Conclusions: Our findings confirm the results of a prior, comparable survey inquiring CPOE researchers. Further research should focus on implementing these context factors in CPOE systems and on subsequently evaluating their impac...|$|R
