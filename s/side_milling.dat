40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} an optimal cutting-parameter design of heavy cutting in <b>side</b> <b>milling</b> for SUS 304 stainless steel. The orthogonal array with relational analysis {{is applied to}} optimize the <b>side</b> <b>milling</b> process with multiple performance characteristics. A grey relational grade obtained from the grey relational analysis {{is used as a}} performance index to determine the optimal cutting parameters. The selected cutting parameters are cutting speed, feed per tooth, axial depth of cut, and radial depth of cut, while the considered performance characteristics are tool life and metal removal rate. Experimental results have shown that cutting performance in the <b>side</b> <b>milling</b> process for heavy cutting can be significantly improved through this approach...|$|E

40|$|Computerized numerically {{controlled}} (CNC) routers {{have been used}} under hard processing conditions {{with the aim of}} raising productivity. Therefore, tool wear progresses rapidly, and burr formation occurs on the surface of wood and wood-based materials frequently. Because this burr formation greatly influences product quality and productivity, the development of a system that can monitor it automatically is needed. In this study, to monitor the burr formed because of tool wear, a charge-coupled device (CCD) vision sensor with high reliability in monitoring was installed in a CNC router, and a system for monitoring the burr formation in <b>side</b> <b>milling</b> and for removing it automatically was developed. In addition, verification experiments of this system were carried out. The main results obtained are as follow: The <b>side</b> <b>milling</b> system for monitoring burr formation was composed of a CCD vision sensor, a personal computer (PC) for CNC router control, and a monitoring PC to control other devices and collect sampling data for the burr formation. From the result of our verification experiment, it was found that this system could measure the area of the burr formed in <b>side</b> <b>milling</b> and remove it automatically...|$|E
40|$|For {{time and}} cost saving reasons, the lowest surface {{roughness}} possible is sought in milling operations. High speed milling is recommended {{in order to}} minimise the amount of material to be removed in subsequent finishing operations, e. g. grinding, electrical discharge machining or manual polishing. Several roughness parameters are usually employed for the characterization of polished surfaces. In this paper relevant roughness parameters are determined for polishing operations after <b>side</b> <b>milling</b> with cylindrical milling tool or after ball-end milling. It was observed that, in polishing operations after <b>side</b> <b>milling,</b> most relevant parameters are average roughness parameters such as Rk and Ra.

40|$|This project {{deals with}} {{modelling}} and simulation of <b>side</b> <b>milling</b> using Finite Element Analysis. The {{objective of this}} thesis is to validate the cutting force result between simulation and experiment. It describes how the finite element analysis predicts the cutting force before the machining process is proceeded. The data obtained in this project were cutting force and stress during the <b>side</b> <b>milling</b> process. Machining parameters such as cutting speed, feed rate, spindle speed were also studied. The cutting force and stress prediction was done by using finite element analysis software called ABAQUS. The finite element analysis was analyzed based on the interaction between aluminium 6061 work piece and high speed steel tool cutter. The cutting forces were measured by using dynamometer during the <b>side</b> <b>milling</b> process. The machining parameters were calculated before the experiment started. Finally, the cutting force in the three directions which is X, Y and Z direction versus time was measured and recorded in the data acquisition software which is Dyno-ware. From the results of dynamometer, noise has been eliminated to get the certain time period of cutting force. The results between simulation and experiment indicates that the predicted and the measured cutting force of milling process are in a good agreement...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce {{polishing}} time, the lowest surface roughness possible is sought in milling operations. In order to determine whether polishing time {{is directly related to}} previous milling conditions, several tests were performed. In <b>side</b> <b>milling</b> with cylindrical milling tool, feed per tooth f of 0. 02 and 0. 06 mm tooth- 1 revolution- 1 were considered. In ball-end milling, feed per tooth f of 0. 05 and 0. 40 mm tooth- 1 revolution- 1, and radial depth of cut Rd of 0. 25 and 0. 40 mm were taken into account. Results show that, in <b>side</b> <b>milling,</b> cutting time was the same regardless of feed employed. On the contrary, in ball-end milling, highest polishing time was obtained if both feed and radial depth is high. At low feed and/or radial depth values, polishing time decreases markedly...|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} cutters is an {{important}} consideration for the manufacture of helicoidal surfaces such as extruder screw surfaces. These surfaces are produced mostly by milling processes using form cutters of end <b>mill</b> type, <b>side</b> <b>mill</b> type or disc type, such as side-and-face mill or grinding wheel. The methodology proposed in the paper addresses {{the problem of the}} design of cutters for the machining of helicoidal surfaces. Using the proposed methodology, the characteristic profile(s) of the cutter can be determined from the given cross-sectional profile and lead of a helicoidal surface. By sweeping this characteristic profile along an appropriate path or around an axis, the geometry of the specific form cutter can be obtained. Such a geometry could be a turning tool, an end <b>mill,</b> a <b>side</b> <b>mill,</b> a side-and-face mill or a grinding wheel, depending on the process adopted for manufacture. The proposed methodology {{can also be used to}} determine the geometry of the helicoidal surface that will be obtained by using a given cutter.

40|$|Purpose: This {{paper is}} focused on the optimal cutting {{parameters}} design of rough cutting processes in <b>side</b> <b>milling</b> for SKD 61 tool steels. Design/methodology/approach: The fuzzy logics can be a proper basis to perform the optimization procedure with complicated multiple performance characteristics in this paper. Using this approach combined with the grey-relational analysis, the design algorithm is transformed into optimization of a single and simple grey-fuzzy reasoning grade rather than multiple performance characteristics. The Taguch method is also adopted to search for an optimal combination of cutting parameters for this rough cutting process in <b>side</b> <b>milling.</b> Findings: The improvement of tool life and metal removal rate from the initial cutting parameters to the optimal cutting parameters are 54 % and 9. 7 %. Hence, this reveals that the proposed approach in this study can effectively improve the cutting performance. Research limitations/implications: In this paper only four cutting parameters are taken into consideration. Many other parameters such as tool geometric shape are not applied to this study. Practical implications: It is believed that this optimal result can be applied to practical processes to effectively reduce manufacturing cost and greatly enhance manufacturing efficiency. Originality/value: A systematic and effective optimization method is presented in this paper. Using this method can effectively acquire an optimal combination of the cutting parameters...|$|E
