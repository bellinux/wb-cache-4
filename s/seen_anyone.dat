5|$|That {{shot was}} totally and {{completely}} inspired by 'Something's Got to Give,' Marilyn Monroe's last movie that never got finished. It's {{an homage to}} her, because I've never <b>seen</b> <b>anyone</b> re-create it. So many people have emulated so many of Marilyn's classic moments, but it's just that I'm {{a big fan of}} hers, and I thought it was really pretty at night with the pool. No one could ever be as fabulous as Marilyn was, but it's in honor and homage to her.|$|E
25|$|After Fatboy {{breaks a}} tree in Albert Square, Leon helps to replace it but is horrified to {{discover}} the body of Owen Turner (Lee Ross) buried beneath it. The next day Zsa Zsa makes a joke when Leon speaks after a prolonged silence, causing Leon to walk out. She finds him to apologise, as she had not realised the discovery had affected him badly. He then recalls the day his mother {{died in a car}} crash when it took an hour for firemen to cut him free and he was unable to lean over to close his mother's eyes. He admits to Zsa Zsa that he sometimes feels alone. He fails most of his GCSE exams. Months later he flirts with Glenda Mitchell (Glynis Barber) in the local bookmaker's and agree to meet later. He obtains two tickets to a music festival in France and plans to take Zsa Zsa, but he reveals to Fatboy that he slept with Glenda, who tells Mercy, who then tells Zsa Zsa. Zsa Zsa asks Leon if he has <b>seen</b> <b>anyone</b> else but he says no. Zsa Zsa then seduces Leon in Fatboy's van before throwing him out in his underwear and leaving Walford for France. Leon decides that as his bags are packed he will go to France anyway, hinting that he will follow Zsa Zsa to apologise and resume their relationship. Before leaving, he tells Fatboy that he will always be his best friend and they continue to stay in touch.|$|E

500|$|Vrba {{testified in}} January 1985 at the seven-week trial in Toronto of Holocaust denier Ernst Zündel, which ended with Zündel's {{conviction}} for knowingly publishing false material about the Holocaust. Vrba acknowledged that several passages in I Cannot Forgive (1964) {{were based on}} secondhand accounts. According to his deposition for Eichmann's trial in 1961, he obtained his information about the gas chambers and crematoria from Sonderkommando Filip Müller and others who worked there, something that Müller confirmed in 1979. Zündel's lawyer, Doug Christie, accused Vrba of lying about Auschwitz and asked whether he had <b>seen</b> <b>anyone</b> gassed. Vrba replied that he had watched people being taken into the buildings and had seen SS officers throw in gas canisters after them: ...|$|E
500|$|Inez and Vinoodh {{explained}} that the video symbolizes [...] "this idea that she goes through this struggle to go back onstage, which is in that pink laser tower. And she's sort of dragging that leg as a trophy and making it back on stage as a fully-realized, complete new person". Jo Ratcliffe, a London-based illustrator known for her hand-drawn graphic design, was hired to provide animation effects for the video. She described Gaga as [...] "really tough" [...] during filming and added that she had [...] "never <b>seen</b> <b>anyone</b> push themselves so hard." [...] Gaga spoke of this intensity during {{an interview with the}} radio station Z100 New York, explaining that it was difficult for her to quickly mould herself into the different personalities portrayed in the video.|$|E

She stated that the song [...] "has qualities of Prince that I've never <b>seen</b> <b>anyone</b> muster up before". Amanda Murray of Sputnikmusic called the song [...] "musically and melodically great", but criticized its lyrics. She {{wrote that the}} lyrics sound like the {{dialogue}} of a [...] "low-rent porn film", highlighting the lines: [...] "She's pressed up on me; I think she's ready to blow?" [...] and [...] "All I need is a moment alone, to give you my tongue and {{get you out of}} control". According to Murray, [...] "It makes one question exactly what films Timberlake was starring in during his sabbatical." [...] She concluded that [...] "FutureSex/LoveSound" [...] establishes a pattern for the rest of FutureSex/LoveSounds: [...] "infectiously catchy and in many cases accomplished pop music, marred by retardedly retarded lyrics".|$|E

500|$|Hull was {{remembered by}} his comrades as an {{exceptional}} pilot and an affable, jovial personality. Jimmy Beedle, in his 1966 history of No.43 Squadron, called Hull {{one of its}} all-time great characters, citing him as {{a major factor in}} the squadron's [...] "high standard of flying and... outstanding squadron spirit". John Simpson, who joined the unit as a pilot officer two months after Hull, recalled finding [...] "a confidence when flying with Caesar that was wholly lacking otherwise." [...] "I have never <b>seen</b> <b>anyone</b> who could throw a fighter about with so much confidence as old Caesar," [...] said another pilot, quoted by Beedle. [...] "Nobody gave me so much confidence to have a lead from, nobody gave me so much exhilaration and fun.

500|$|Webcomic creator Randall Munroe {{described}} {{his reasons for}} creating [...] "Time" [...] {{in an interview with}} Rolling Stone, where he stated that he {{came up with the idea}} as he was pondering the space between animation and a daily comic, wanting to do something [...] "in between". In an interview with Computer Sweden, Munroe stated that he had never <b>seen</b> <b>anyone</b> attempt such a project before and that he [...] "wanted to see if it would work." [...] Munroe noted that, in some cases, [...] "things become more interesting if they are difficult to access," [...] such as in books that deliberately make the story more complicated. He hoped that, as people slowly got into it, the world and language would excite readers on a deeper level. According to Munroe, nothing like [...] "Time" [...] had been done before because it is difficult to reach people once every hour without a tool such as the Internet.|$|E
500|$|A {{prolific}} goalscorer, Messi {{is known}} for his finishing, positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and precise passing, and is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker, though his ability on penalties has somewhat deteriorated in recent seasons. His pace and technical ability enable him to undertake individual dribbling runs towards goal, in particular during counterattacks, usually starting from the halfway line or {{the right side of the}} pitch. Widely considered to be the best dribbler in the world, and one of the greatest of all time, with regard to this ability, his former Argentina manager Diego Maradona has said of him, [...] "The ball stays glued to his foot; I've seen great players in my career, but I've never <b>seen</b> <b>anyone</b> with Messi's ball control." [...] Beyond his individual qualities, he is also a well-rounded, hard-working team player, known for his creative combinations, in particular with Barcelona midfielders Xavi and Andrés Iniesta.|$|E

There’s this competitive but playful obsession with her" [...] which is seen with Underwood's [...] "flirtation" [...] and [...] "feminine prowess". Regan continued, [...] "She knows that to be on top she has to beat Peggy ... So Dottie does want to get under her skin. She tries to make her feel uncomfortable and that might be with a look or a glance or what she says." [...] Atwell said, [...] "Peggy has male baddies that she fights, but to have someone who is physically her equal—she's a Black Widow, incredibly capable and very smart—I think that shows some balance for Peggy, like a flip side of the same coin." [...] After Carter defeats Underwood and Leviathan in the first season, Underwood becomes [...] "a lone wolf ... she’s a woman without a country right now, but she is more involved in the [...] case" [...] for the second season than it initially appears.|$|E
500|$|Prior {{to being}} cast in Glee, Colfer had no {{professional}} acting experience. He originally auditioned {{for the role}} of Artie Abrams, performing [...] "Mr. Cellophane" [...] from the musical Chicago. Murphy was so impressed by his performance that the role of Kurt was created for him. To keep the number of students in the glee club constant, a character named Rajish was cut from the show. Kurt's name is inspired by the character Kurt von Trapp from The Sound of Music, a role that Colfer once played as a child. The Hummel surname comes from the popular German Hummel figurines; Colfer explained in an interview that Murphy thought he had their rosy-cheeked complexion. Murphy praised Colfer's abilities despite his lack of formal training, saying, [...] "I just thought he was so talented and gifted and unusual. I've never <b>seen</b> <b>anyone</b> who looks like him or acts like him or sounds like him. You'd think he’d been at Juilliard for six years but he hasn't." [...] Murphy saw something of himself in the young actor, a fact that Colfer says is [...] "completely mind-blowing". Colfer added, [...] "For him to see me in him, I can't even describe it." ...|$|E
500|$|SFScope {{columnist}} Sarah Stegall also lauded Torv's performance, {{noting that}} the actress [...] "captures Nimoy's staccato delivery, her growling voice, even his trick eyebrow. Not since Zachary Quinto played a young Spock in Star Trek {{a couple of years}} ago have I <b>seen</b> <b>anyone</b> so perfectly sound and move like Nimoy." [...] Stegall did express a wish that the characters not try to explain every case (such as the one in the episode) out of a belief that their explanations were often absurd; this observation led Stegall to praise the new character of Lincoln however, as she believed, like Hanson, that the series has [...] "been needing an Everyman in this mix for awhile, someone for whom immortality is not a commonplace." [...] Charlie Jane Anders of io9 was critical of the episode, remarking that [...] "the whole 'soul magnets' thing, which had seemed to be a throwaway comment a few episodes ago, is turning out to be sort of a weak plot device. And the whole bodily-possession storyline is just perhaps one level of wackiness too far for me. I also had the feeling that this might finally be the acting challenge that was beyond Anna Torv's considerable abilities, as her Leonard Nimoy impression quickly started to grate on my nerves." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} at Power Station Studio in New York at a quick pace. Rodgers {{enlisted the help}} of his former Chic bandmates Edwards, who was the bassist, and Tony Thompson, who played the drums; they appeared on several tracks of the album. Rodgers decided to be the guitarist, when Edwards requested him to do so, in exchange for their help. The recording sessions did not start until the afternoon as Rodgers, who attended late-night parties, was not accustomed to work in early mornings. The schedule was also difficult for Madonna, who recalled that she used to [...] "go to the swim club on the Upper West Side and go swimming and walk from there to the recording studio. It was impossible for me to reach there at morning." [...] Rodgers recalled that Madonna was a real hard worker and incredibly tenacious. He commented: [...] "I am always amazed by Madonna's incredible judgement {{when it comes to making}} pop records. I've never <b>seen</b> <b>anyone</b> do it better, and that's the truth. When we did that album, it was the perfect union, and I knew it from the first day in the studio. The thing between us, man, it was sexual, it was passionate, it was creativity... it was pop." ...|$|E
500|$|Rivera {{achieved}} {{a reputation as}} an all-time great reliever among baseball experts and his peers. Hall of Fame starter-turned-closer Dennis Eckersley called him [...] "the best ever, no doubt", while Trevor Hoffman said he [...] "will go down as the best reliever in the game in history". Torre said, [...] "He's the best I've ever been around. Not only the ability to pitch and perform under pressure, but the calm he puts over the clubhouse." [...] Writer Tom Verducci said, [...] "Rivera is definitively the best at his position by a wider margin than any player at any position {{in the history of}} baseball. There is Rivera, a gulf, and then every other closer." [...] He compared Rivera's reputation for being the best at his position to that of Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky. MLB Commissioner Bud Selig said, [...] "Clearly unequivocally, he's the greatest relief pitcher of all time, and did {{it in a way that}} was remarkable." [...] Speaking about Rivera's looming presence at the end of games, Alex Rodriguez said, [...] "He's the only guy in baseball who can change the game from a seat in the clubhouse or the bullpen. He would start affecting teams as early as the fifth inning, because they knew he was out there. I've never <b>seen</b> <b>anyone</b> who could affect a game like that." [...] Gossage said that Rivera [...] "might be the greatest closer of all-time" [...] but suggested that the modern closer's job has become too specialized and easy compared to multiple-inning [...] "firemen" [...] from Gossage's era; Rivera had only one regular season save of seven-plus outs in his career, whereas Gossage logged 53. Although the Baseball Writers' Association of America has historically been reluctant to elect relievers into the Baseball Hall of Fame, sportswriters anticipate that Rivera will be elected in his first year of eligibility. In 2016, ESPN.com ranked Rivera 49th on its list of the greatest MLB players.|$|E
500|$|The album spawned five singles in total. On December8, 2010, {{the band}} {{released}} the artwork for the album's first single, titled [...] "Hear Me Now".

[...] "Hear Me Now" [...] was the album's most successful single, charting variously on the Billboard Heatseeker charts, Alternative charts, and the Rock charts. On March22, the band appeared live on the late night talk show Lopez Tonight as a musical guest where they performed the single [...] "Hear Me Now" [...] to promote the album. The band reportedly almost drank the entire bar behind the Turner Broadcasting System set, with George Lopez saying to J-Dog, [...] "Drink all of it. Go ahead, I don’t care. But I've never <b>seen</b> <b>anyone</b> drink that much." [...] The album's second and third official singles, [...] "Been to Hell" [...] and [...] "Coming Back Down", were both released on March 15, 2011. [...] "Been to Hell" [...] was previously released as a promotional single with a lyric video on February 6, but was then released as a single with a music video, leading to it chart on Billboards Heatseeker and Bubbling Under Hot 100 charts. Because [...] "Coming Back Down" [...] was released {{on the same day}} as [...] "Been to Hell", the track did not get a music video. [...] "Coming Back Down" [...] previously surfaced due to a leak on February 18 and was later confirmed to be on the album and was produced by Kevin Rudolf. Brian Voerding noted that the song showed the band's strength in both singing and rapping while comparing the sound to Linkin Park. The album's fourth single, [...] "Comin' in Hot", was released on April 9 with a music video to celebrate the album's release. Similar to [...] "Been to Hell", [...] "Comin' in Hot" [...] was originally a free promotional single released on January 21, but was later released as an album single following the release of American Tragedy. The track was reviewed by Evigshed along with [...] "Hear Me Now" [...] after it was released as a promotional single, who gave both [...] "Comin' in Hot" [...] and [...] "Hear Me Now" [...] a perfect ten out of ten score, noting that [...] "Comin' in Hot" [...] was much more upbeat and was extremely catchy. On July 8, it was announced the fifth single for the album would be [...] "My Town". The band began shooting the music video in early July and announced that fans would be featured in the video if they recorded themselves performing the song in front of a famous landmark. The video has no release date yet.|$|E
