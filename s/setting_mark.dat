40|$|OVER THE PAST decade, {{human service}} {{programs}} created specifi-cally for the complex of work, workers. and workplace have been {{embraced by the}} private and public sectors and by unions. These programs are not in themselves unique, nor do they address recently identified problems. Alcoholism, drug abuse, stress, mari-tal problems. relocation, emotional ill-ness. retirement, and termination are aspects of the human condition that have held the attention of clinicians and policymakers for some time. What is unique is the setting in which these issues are now addressed. His-torically, production goals of the cor-poration and the human and social needs of employees have existed in uneasy tension. Work concerns and personal concerns were assumed to be separate spheres, appropriately (ac-cording to conventional Wisdom) dis-tinct. Consequently, the introduction of human service programs such as Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) and the proliferation of social workers within the occupational <b>setting</b> <b>mark</b> a new development for social work and for the U. S. workplace. Occupational social work today is quickly evolving from isolated set· tings into a widespread field of prac-tice. This evolution emerges from a rich historical context that is de-scribed at length in this article. It also raises within the profession of social work several fundamental issues that deserve discussion. These issues reflect both the tensions and the potential that characterize oc-cupational social work in the 1980 s. LEGACY OF THE PAST The growth of occupational social work {{in the past several years}} has been dramatic. Less than 100 prac-titioners could be identified to par...|$|E
40|$|The {{currently}} unnamed early Cambrian (Series 2, Stage 4) sandstone unit {{is exposed}} in the Minto Inlier of western Victoria Island, Canadian Arctic Islands, and forms {{the base of}} the Phanerozoic succession. Coeval with other sandstones of this age in Laurentia, it was deposited in a shallow-marine embayment on the passive margin during the initial phase of the early Paleozoic transgression. Four facies associations are recognized: (1) outer embayment sand dune complex characterized by laterally continuous, planar cross-stratified, medium- to coarse-grained sandstone; (2) inner embayment sand flat consisting dominantly of fine- to medium-grained bioturbated sandstone and fine- to medium-grained sandstone interbedded with laminated mudstone; (3) coastal lagoon characterized by laterally continuous, medium-grained oolitic ironstone and fine- to medium-grained bioturbated sandstone; and (4) offshore muddy shelf consisting dominantly of laminated mudstone with discontinuous seams of medium- to coarse sand. Bioturbation {{in the form of a}} typical early Cambrian suite of shallow-subtidal ichnofossils predominated in the inner embayment and coastal lagoon settings, representing a low-diversity Cruziana ichnofacies. Oolitic ironstone horizons in the coastal lagoon <b>setting</b> <b>mark</b> periods of low sedimentation rates when iron became concentrated and calcite was the primary cementing agent. Dunes are, for the most part, non-bioturbated or contain just a few individual burrows belonging to Skolithos, representing the Skolithos ichnofacies. The dominantly tabular, sheet-like geometry of the sandstones characterizes a comparatively lower energy regime than what has been found in typical complex dune geometries in modern and ancient examples and is attributed to sediment deposition under essentially uniform current speeds at consistent water depth conditions on a low-gradient shelf. Paleocurrent measurements and thickness variation suggest that deposition was affected by undulating topography on the Proterozoic basement within facies association 1 and 2, as well as by syndepositional faulting in some areas. The coastline is envisaged as a complex of bays and lagoons. The embayment opened to the northwest where sandbars developed offshore; stratigraphic thinning towards both the south and northeast indicates the direction of the paleoshoreline. Approximately shoreline orthogonal paleocurrents are considered indicative of a tidal origin. The lack of hummocky cross-stratification suggests there was no influence of major storms in this region...|$|E

Some traditional sets use 馬 for both colors. Horses begin the game {{next to the}} elephants, on their outside flanks. A horse moves and captures one point orthogonally and then one point diagonally away from its former position, a move which is traditionally described as being like the character 日 Rì. The horse does not jump as the knight does in Western chess, and can be blocked by a piece located one point horizontally or vertically adjacent to it. Blocking a horse is called [...] "hobbling the horse's leg" [...] (蹩馬腿). The diagram on the left illustrates the horse's movement.|$|R
