50|$|Lavender v. Kurn, 327 U.S. 645 (1946) {{was a case}} {{decided by}} the Supreme Court of the United States dealing with a negligent {{wrongful}} death case against a railroad employer under the Federal Employers Liability Act. L.E. Haney was a <b>switchtender</b> who was killed at Grand Central Station in Memphis, Tennessee. He worked for both the Illinois Central and Frisco railroads.|$|E
50|$|Until July 6, 2007, the {{crossing}} {{was controlled by}} a human <b>switchtender</b> in a cabin near {{the crossing}} using semaphore signals to govern train movements through the diamonds. Because the crossing was not interlocked, all trains were required to make a stop before proceeding over the crossing as signaled by the specific semaphore signal governing the track the train was on. As a major crossing, {{and one of the}} few remaining locations with this classic method of operation, Brighton Park was a major attraction for rail enthusiasts, but had become increasingly inefficient for Chicago area rail operations.|$|E
50|$|As {{part of the}} Chicago Region Environmental and Transportation Efficiency Program (CREATE) project, the Brighton Park crossing, the {{semaphore}} signals, and <b>switchtender's</b> cabin {{were taken}} out of service {{on the evening of}} Friday, July 6, 2007 and conversion to an interlocked crossing ensued over the following weekend. As part of the conversion project, some of the tracks at the crossing were realigned and new crossing diamonds were put in place.|$|R

50|$|The Chicago and Western Indiana Railroad {{operated}} {{an extensive}} number of interlocking tower system on its system. From the north, towers were as follows: 12th Street tower, 15th Street tower, 16th Street tower, 21st Street tower, 40th Street tower, 47th Street tower, Ford Street tower (59th Street), 74th Street tower, 81st Street tower, Oakdale (later remote controlled by 81st Street), Pullman Junction, South Deering (112th St., later remote controlled from Main Line Drawbridge), Main Line Drawbridge {{and the famous}} State Line tower, which was North America's largest interlocking controlled by strong-arm mechanical levers. Pullman Junction was not a conventional interlocked junction, {{although there was a}} small interlocking machine for the signals protecting the C&WI-BRC junction there. The crossings were protected by gates and tilting targets. All trains were required to stop. <b>Switchtenders</b> were located at Dearborn Station, 31st Street, 80th Street and Pullman Junction.|$|R
5000|$|At {{its peak}} the {{crossing}} involved {{a total of}} 8 tracks of the PRR, B&OCT and CR&I crossing the two tracks of the C&A. Also included in the complex {{were a number of}} hand operated crossovers and wye tracks. Each of the 4 railroads involved in the crossing employed switchtenders on site to manage any crossover or connecting movements, with the PRR maintaining two tender stations, north and south of the crossing, to protect the two B&OCT to C&A wye tracks where they each crossed the Panhandle main line and the C&A crossing itself. [...] <b>Switchtender</b> cabin [...] "A" [...] managed the Alton crossing and would continue to do so until the crossing was interlocked in 2007.|$|E
50|$|After {{attending}} the Bronx High School of Science Mazer served in World War II in the U.S. Army Air Force from 1943-45. He became a sergeant, and {{he received a}} Purple Heart and an Air Medal with four bronze oak leaf clusters after his B-17 bomber was shot down over Czechoslovakia in April 1945. His wartime experiences eventually inspired several works of historical fiction, including The Last Mission and the Boy at War series (A Boy at War, A Boy No More, and Heroes Don't Run). After returning to the U.S., Mazer went to Union College, where he earned a BA in 1948. From 1950 to 1955 he was a railroad brakeman and <b>switchtender</b> for New York Central. He was an English teacher in upstate New York at the Central Square School for a year, in 1959. In 1960 he received a M.A. from Syracuse University.|$|E
5000|$|Iowa Falls {{businessman}} E.S. Ellsworth {{founded the}} Des Moines, Iowa Falls & Northern Railroad (DIF&N) in 1899 {{with the intention}} of connecting Iowa Falls to Des Moines. The Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad acquired the BCR&N in 1903, and created the St. Paul & Des Moines Railroad to acquire the DIF&N and to complete the line to St. Paul, Minnesota beginning in 1905. This new Rock Island route created a new Junction with the IC to the east of the original Iowa Falls junction. The two-story frame Mills Tower was built at the new junction about 1909. It was designed by the IC and may have been built by them as well. [...] Offices were located on the first floor, and the control room was on the second floor. The second contributing building is the c. 1912 signal maintainers and supply house. It was used mainly as storage and office space for the <b>switchtender.</b> The other buildings in this district were built later. They include the coal house, oil house, and tool house, all from about 1945, and an outhouse from 1976.|$|E
