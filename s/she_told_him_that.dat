5|$|R.C. MacLeod listed another tradition, {{somewhat}} {{similar to the}} one that appeared in c.1800 manuscript. According to this version, a MacLeod joined a Crusading army, and went to the Holy Land. While in the desert-wilderness, he came across a witch, from whom he managed to escape. He then came upon a river, and proceeded to cross it at a ford. However, a fairy maiden appeared from the water and blocked his passage. After a struggle, MacLeod overcame the fairy and passed over the river. He then became friends with her. Before they parted, the fairy maiden gave him a box of scented wood; this box, she told him, held several other smaller boxes, which fitted inside one another. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> the innermost box contained a magic banner, which when waved would bring forth a host of armed men to aid its owner. The fairy warned the MacLeod, that if he were to open the box within a year and a day from then, that no crops would grow on his land, no livestock would be born, as well as no children. When the MacLeod returned home he gave the box to the chief's wife. The wife, however, ignored the MacLeod's warning, and opened the box. Immediately a host of armed men appeared and that year, no children were born. The tradition concluded that ever since that time, the flag had been preserved for a time when such an army might mean salvation for the clan.|$|E

25|$|Georgian foreign {{minister}} Eka Tkeshelashvili called the Assistant Secretary of State of the United States, Daniel Fried. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> Russian tanks were moving towards South Ossetia, but Fried replied that war must be avoided.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, {{newspapers}} {{reported that}} Sir Hugh Rhys Rankin {{claimed to have}} met Ethel Le Neve in 1930 in Australia and that on that occasion, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> Crippen murdered his wife because she had syphilis.|$|E

60|$|He still persisted {{that he did}} {{not believe}} the story, but it became clear to her, by degrees, that the meaning of it all had at last sunk into his mind, and that he did believe it. Over and over again <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> all <b>that</b> <b>she</b> knew, {{explaining}} to him what his mother had suffered, making him perceive why she had removed herself out of his hands, and had leant on others for advice. And <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> also <b>that</b> though they still hoped that the jury might acquit her, the property must be abandoned.|$|R
25|$|When her spouse was {{informed}} that he was King, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> she would become his reliable adviser and confidante, but keep away from the matters of the state.

25|$|When Faustina went to Sopoćko for {{her first}} confession, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> she had been conversing with Jesus, who had a plan for her.

25|$|Gayda won TNA's Knockout of the Year 2005 on the January 14, 2006 {{episode of}} Impact!.

60|$|His {{father came}} back from going down-stairs with the doctor, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> all <b>that</b> Pony had told her, {{and it seemed to}} Pony that his father could hardly keep from laughing. But his mother did not even smile.|$|R
60|$|Then the Queen {{was very}} much ashamed, and {{she saw that the}} King was vexed with her; so <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> all <b>that</b> the fairies had {{predicted}} about Rosette, and begged him to think how the misfortunes might be prevented.|$|R
25|$|Wuornos told several {{inconsistent}} {{stories about}} the killings. She claimed initially that all seven men had raped her while she {{was working as a}} prostitute but later recanted the claim of self-defense, citing robbery and a desire to leave no witnesses as the reason for murder. During an interview with filmmaker Nick Broomfield, when she thought the cameras were off, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> it was, in fact, self-defense, but she could not stand being on death row—where she had been for ten years at that point—and wanted to die.|$|E
25|$|After La Gioconda, Callas had {{no further}} offers, and when Serafin, {{looking for someone}} to sing Isolde, called on her, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> she already knew the score, even though she had looked at only the first act out of curiosity while at the conservatory. She sight-read the opera's second act for Serafin, who praised her for knowing the role so well, whereupon she {{admitted}} to having bluffed and having sight-read the music. Even more impressed, Serafin immediately cast her in the role. Serafin thereafter served as Callas's mentor and supporter.|$|E
25|$|Biting {{his beard}} and {{ignoring}} his wounds, Starkad charged the Danish army, killing man after man, until {{he met the}} shieldmaiden Ursina who carried the banner of king Harald Wartooth. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> he had met his last opponent, but he cut off the hand that held the banner and killed her. Starkad continued killing warrior after warrior, until he finally was so severely wounded {{that he had a}} large gash on his neck and a large gash on his chest that made his two lungs hang out. On his right hand, he had lost a finger.|$|E
60|$|The {{next time}} he came, however, she brought it out, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> again <b>that</b> he was too proud. He {{repeated}} that he couldn't change, and this time she felt the impulse to say that with a little effort he might change.|$|R
60|$|She did not {{understand}} from this much better than she did before; but, as she had great confidence in Raymond, she concluded to let him manage in his own way. <b>She</b> accordingly <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> he might fix the saw, and take Caleb with him.|$|R
50|$|Jana saw Kevin out at {{the opening}} of his mother Gloria's nightclub Gloworm with Chloe Mitchell and apologized to him for what {{happened}} with Ryder. <b>She</b> also <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> wanted to give their marriage another chance, but Kevin refused, still hurt over Jana cheating on him.|$|R
25|$|Hernando de Soto, the Spanish conquistador who during 1540–1542 traversed {{what became}} the {{southeast}} United States, encountered many different mound-builder peoples, perhaps descendants of the great Mississippian culture. The mound-building tradition still existed in the southeast during the mid-sixteenth century. De Soto observed people living in fortified towns with lofty mounds and plazas, and surmised {{that many of the}} mounds served as foundations for priestly temples. Near present-day Augusta, Georgia, de Soto encountered a mound-building group ruled by a queen, Cofitachequi. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> the mounds within her territory served as the burial places for nobles.|$|E
25|$|He is a harsh taskmaster, likes {{being the}} boss, {{and is not}} very forgiving. One of his former {{tactical}} trainees from Quantico, Liz Warner has proclaimed to this and, after Colby confided in her {{that he made a}} mistake, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> the very fact that he still remains on Don's team means something. She also said that Don never spoke of his personal life while at the FBI Academy and was at the time fresh from the field in hunting fugitives (with friend Agent Cooper). Liz knows he has mellowed with age and he can hold a commitment with a woman for longer periods of time.|$|E
25|$|Pepys {{had taken}} to {{sleeping}} on his office floor; on Wednesday, 5 September, he was awakened by his wife at 2 a.m. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> the fire had almost reached All Hallows-by-the-Tower {{and that it was}} at the foot of Seething Lane. He decided to send her and his gold – about £2,350 – to Woolwich. In the following days, Pepys witnessed looting, disorder, and disruption. On 7 September, he went to Paul's Wharf and saw the ruins of St Paul's Cathedral, of his old school, of his father's house, and of the house in which he had had his stone removed. Despite all this destruction, Pepys's house, office, and diary were saved.|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Kenton {{waited for}} her husband in much less comfort, and when he came, and asked, restlessly, [...] "Where are the children?"

60|$|Wom. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> again, <b>that</b> he {{desired to}} live peaceably, and {{to follow his}} calling, that his family might be maintained; and moreover, said, My Lord, I have four small children, that cannot help themselves, {{one of which is}} blind, and have nothing to live upon, but the charity of good people.|$|R
25|$|Bishop Stefan (Nikitin) was {{a medical}} doctor and this {{assisted}} his survival in the concentration camps through work as a camp doctor. He often allowed the overworked and underfed prisoners {{to be allowed to}} stay in hospital to recuperate. The camp authorities became aware of this and warned him that a new trial was probably awaiting him that would have a possible maximum sentence of fifteen years for wrecking Soviet industrial effort by taking workers from their jobs. The bishop was told by a nurse of a woman named Matrionushka in the Volga city of Penza who he should ask to pray for him, and he was told that Matrionushka did not need a letter because she could hear him if he asked for her help. He shouted for her help, and the threatened trial did not happen, and he was released several weeks later. He moved to Penza in order to find Matrionushka. When he met her, she supposedly knew intimate details about him and that he had asked for her help, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> he had prayed to the Lord for him. She was soon arrested, however, and transported to a Moscow prison where she died.|$|E
25|$|From January 1978 {{until the}} early 1990s Genie moved {{through a series of}} at least four {{additional}} foster homes and institutions, some of which subjected her to extreme physical abuse and harassment. Shurley saw her at her 27th birthday party, in 1984, and again two years later, and in an interview years later he said that both times she was very depressed and uncommunicative. In 1992, Curtiss told Russ Rymer that the only two updates she had heard on Genie indicated she barely spoke and was depressed and withdrawn. When Rymer published a two-part magazine article on Genie in The New Yorker in April of that year he wrote that she lived in an institution and only saw her mother one weekend every month, as did the first edition of his 1993 book, entitled Genie: A Scientific Tragedy. The afterword of the 1994 edition of Rymer's book on Genie, written in November 1993, detailed conversations he had with Genie's mother—who had since gone blind again due to glaucoma—just before and after the publication of his magazine articles. At that time <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> Genie had recently moved into a more supportive foster home which permitted regular visits, and said that Genie was happy and, although hard to understand, was significantly more verbal.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Kaycee {{revealed}} to an online friend of hers, Randall van der Woning, that she suffered from leukemia, {{which was then}} in remission.

Sympathetic, Van der Woning offered {{to set up and}} host a blog for her to chronicle her struggles; Kaycee accepted the offer and the two created [...] "Living Colours" [...] in August 2000.|$|E
50|$|She went {{there and}} stayed in Chandragiri hill which was in Degva's area. There was a {{beautiful}} garden of King Degva just below the hill. She used to go there in night in form of a beautiful horse. King ordered to catch this horse. Fortunately, King himself found her {{in the garden and}} he tracked her in order to catch her. She went to hill again and came into her own apsara form. Seeing her beauty, king got attracted and asked her to stay with him in his palace. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> her story about her being Apsara and her punishment. <b>She</b> also <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> will go to Indralok once her punishment will be over.

60|$|The idea struck Newman as {{too dark}} and horrible for belief, {{and made him}} feel {{as he would have}} done if <b>she</b> had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was going to {{mutilate}} her beautiful face, or drink some potion that would make her mad. He clasped his hands and began to tremble, visibly.|$|R
