50|$|The {{first job}} in {{operating}} Colossus {{for a new}} message, was to prepare the paper tape loop. This was performed by the Wrens who stuck the two ends together using Bostik, ensuring {{that there was a}} 150-character length of blank tape between the end and the start of the message. Using a special hand punch they inserted a start hole between the third and fourth channels 2½ sprocket holes {{from the end of the}} blank section, and a <b>stop</b> <b>hole</b> between the fourth and fifth channels 1½ sprocket holes from the end of the characters of the message. These were read by specially positioned photocells and indicated when the message was about to start and when it ended. The operator would then thread the paper tape through the gate and around the pulleys of the bedstead and adjust the tension. The two-tape bedstead design had been carried on from Heath Robinson so that one tape could be loaded whilst the previous one was being run. A switch on the Selection Panel specified the “near“ or the “far” tape (this can be seen at the top left of the photograph of the panel).|$|E
40|$|Drilling a hole {{ahead of}} crack tip {{is one of}} the most common techniques, to prevent further crack {{propagation}} in structures subjected to fatigue load. Fatigue cracks are typically occur at locations where drilling a crack <b>stop</b> <b>hole</b> of desired dimensions is not possible due to geometrical constraints. In such cases, crack may reinitiate from the hole after few loading cycles. Techniques such as Static mechanical cold working are used to strengthen the undersized crack <b>stop</b> <b>hole</b> mentioned in the literature. In this study, application of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) patches laminated over cracks is proposed to delay the crack initiation from under sized crack <b>stop</b> <b>hole.</b> Although extensive literature exists for crack <b>stop</b> <b>hole</b> and CFRP patches independently to prevent the crack growth, few literatures are available for combined effect. In the present study combination of crack <b>stop</b> <b>hole</b> and CFRP overlays as a repair technique is studied. This combination helps to reduce the stress at edge of the hole, which delays the crack initiation. The combined effect of crack <b>stop</b> <b>hole</b> and CFRP patches is studied numerically using ANSYS. Steel plate subjected to tensile loading (mode-I) with initial central crack is considered. Material behaviour is assumed to be elastic. A hole is modelled ahead of crack tip and CFRP overlays are applied over it. Holes of various radii are considered to understand the effect of hole radii on stress at the edge of the hole. The entire setup is modelled in ANSYS. Ratio of stress intensity factor to square root of radius is KI / considered as a parameter for all cases. By the application of CFRP patches, the KI / is reduced by 70...|$|E

40|$|Many {{failures}} in engineering applications or machine components {{have been caused}} by a crack initiated from points at which stress was concentrated. As the stress concentration level is higher than a critical value, continuous crack-growth results in failure in the machine components. Crack initiation behavior has been evaluated to prevent an early failure of machine equipment. Delaying the crack initiation is important for the maintenance of machine elements {{as well as for the}} detection of crack initiation. Hence, the main objective of this study is to investigate the delay of crack using <b>stop</b> drilled <b>holes.</b> The investigation was based on the diameter of the <b>stop</b> drilled <b>holes</b> and the arrangement of the <b>stop</b> drilled <b>holes.</b> Both experiment and finite element analysis were done in order to validate the result. The experiment was carried out by using tensile test to obtain maximum applied load to the specimen while the finite element analysis was analyzed by using ALGOR V 22 software to obtain the stress of the specimen. The experimental results and the finite element analysis results show that the crack initiation life of the specimen was longer when the diameter of the <b>stop</b> drilled <b>holes</b> increased. The further the location of the <b>stop</b> drilled <b>holes</b> with the slits location, the longer crack initiation life of the specimen. Thus, the influence of the <b>stop</b> drilled <b>holes</b> on the crack initiation life has been evaluated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Most of {{the failure}} {{accidents}} of machine equipment {{are related to the}} fatigue crack initiation and growth. Therefore, some research was performed to inspect crack initiation and to repair the cracked materials. Those studies are important for the safe operation of machines and to extend the machine life. We have shown some simple methods for arresting crack growth. Those methods are introduced in the present paper. First, a method of drilling stop holes near the crack tip is shown. In this method, additional holes were drilled {{in the vicinity of the}} main <b>stop</b> <b>hole.</b> Second, the method for inserting pins into stop holes is shown. Third, a method of applying a crack arrester for stopping the growth of long cracks is shown...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study, the stop-hole method was {{investigated}} with creating a noncircular hole. The {{aim of the}} present work was to obtain an optimum <b>stop</b> <b>hole</b> shape that gives maximum fatigue crack initiation life by using finite element program. It {{was found that the}} fatigue life obtained by using the optimum hole shape ranges from 2 to 9 times the fatigue life obtained by using the circular holes. It was found that the optimum hole shape increased the initial fatigue life for all specimens used. Opposite to the traditional stress concentration factor minimization problem where the nominal area remains constant during optimization, here it is allowed to vary nominal area using design variables resulting in decreasing of the nominal stress in addition to decreasing of the stress concentration factor. This leads to higher fatigue life compared to previous studies...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{drilling}} a hole ahead of crack tip {{is one of the most}} common techniques to prevent crack propagation in structures subjected to fatigue load. An adequate size crack <b>stop</b> <b>hole</b> is necessary to convert a sharp crack into a blunt notch there by preventing crack propagation. However, fatigue cracks typically occur at locations where drilling a crack-stop hole of required dimensions may not be possible due to geometrical constraints. In such situations, the crack may initiate again from the hole within its service life. Hence, there is a need to strengthen undersized crack-stop holes. In the present study, a combination of crack-stop hole and carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) overlays under static loads are studied numerically using finite element analysis (FEA) to evaluate its potential as a viable repair technique. A steel plate with an initial central crack subjected to static tensile loading is considered. A hole is modelled ahead of a crack tip and CFRP patches are applied on either side of the crack. The numerical analysis is performed using general purpose FEA ANSYS to evaluate the stress intensity factor at notch tip (NSIF). The material behaviour is assumed to be elastic in case of linear analysis and as a multi linear isotropic hardening material type for nonlinear analysis...|$|E

40|$|Static {{tensile test}} results are {{presented}} for specimens of 2014 -T 6, 2024 -T 4, 6061 -T 6, and 7075 -T 6 aluminum alloy containing fatigue cracks. The results {{are found to be}} in good agreement with the results reported for similar tests from other sources. The results indicate that the presence of a fatigue crack reduced the static strength, in all cases, by an amount larger than the corresponding reduction in net area; the 6061 -T 6 alloy specimens were least susceptible to the crack and the 7075 -T 6 alloy specimens were most susceptible. It is indicated that a 7075 -T 6 specimen may develop as little as one-third of the expected static tensile strength when the fatigue crack was consumed only one-fourth of the original area. It was found that the static strength was substantially higher for specimens which had <b>stop</b> <b>holes</b> drilled {{at the end of the}} fatigue crack...|$|R

40|$|Prior to 1985, it {{was common}} {{practice}} to avoid welding the connection plates to the tension flange of the girders of steel bridges.

A field test on two skewed bridges showed that the adhesive-angle retrofit system decreased the out-of-plane strain range by 40 to 50 % when the original strain range was more than 50 microstrains.
