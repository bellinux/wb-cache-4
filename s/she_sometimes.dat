5|$|Henry allowed Catherine {{almost no}} {{political}} influence as queen. Although <b>she</b> <b>sometimes</b> acted as regent during his absences from France, her powers were strictly nominal. Henry gave the Château of Chenonceau, which Catherine had wanted for herself, to Diane de Poitiers, {{who took her}} place at the centre of power, dispensing patronage and accepting favours.|$|E

60|$|Sometimes {{his speech}} filled her mind, seemed to fill all her world; <b>sometimes</b> <b>she</b> ceased to listen, {{following}} thoughts of her own. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>she</b> dozed; <b>sometimes</b> <b>she</b> awakened from sleep {{to find him}} talking. But slowly she realized a thread in his discourse, a progress and development.|$|R
60|$|Presently Birbal {{arrived at}} the cemetery. And what sees he there? A {{beautiful}} woman of a light yellow colour, loaded with jewels from head to foot, holding a horn in her right and a necklace in her left hand. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>she</b> danced, <b>sometimes</b> <b>she</b> jumped, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>she</b> ran about.

5|$|As Anderson {{remained}} {{throughout her}} life evasive {{about the details}} of her life as a commercial writer, it is not known when she began writing commercially under pseudonyms, what those pseudonyms were, or, indeed, how much she wrote. She revealed only that she began writing for magazines and newspapers out of commercial necessity, and rarely under her own name. Although she achieved success later in this field, <b>she</b> <b>sometimes</b> stated that, as her writing improved, her pieces were more frequently turned down for publication. In her thirties, she began to write for commercial radio. Beginning with half-hour slots, Anderson gradually became interested in the technique of crafting radio plays, and began submitting some of her better work to the ABC under her own name. She later ascribed her fondness for writing the expansive dialogue in her novels to her early experience writing radio plays.|$|E
5|$|Farrar {{admitted}} that the marriage was never ideal. He later said that neither had expressed their love to each other, even at {{the early stages of}} marriage. Farrar recounted that Green seemed to lack the coping skills most adults bring to bear in challenging times; when she went into a rage, <b>she</b> <b>sometimes</b> harmed herself or broke things, and rarely gave any thought to whether she was in private or in public during these episodes. By the early 1990s, Farrar worked long hours away from the home to avoid arguments and what he perceived as his wife's shortcomings as a homemaker. When the couple fought, Green responded by treating the children, especially Tim, as small adults and telling them about what their father had done wrong. Swayed by their mother's opinions about their father, the children began to resent and disobey Farrar, to the point where Timothy and Farrar had physical altercations.|$|E

As the guitar intro of the song started, Madonna appeared on the side-stage and started dancing energetically, while flashlights fell on her. While singing the song, <b>she</b> <b>sometimes</b> opened her jacket and sometimes straddled the steel structure present on the stage. The performance ended with Madonna jumping off the side stage, onto the main stage. It was included on the video release, titled , which was shot in Detroit.|$|E

5|$|Amy {{is also a}} major {{character}} in the 2003–2006 anime series Sonic X. Attacking one of Eggman's machines, Sonic triggers Chaos Control and sends him, Amy, Tails and other characters from their world to Earth.

She frequently tries to woo Sonic and his discomfort angers her.

Sonic also rescues Amy from Eggman's creations on other occasions. <b>She</b> <b>sometimes</b> flares up at Sonic, attacking him when she realizes that he has tricked her into acting insane. The second season opens with arcs based on Adventure and Adventure 2, where Amy reprises {{her role in the}} games.
