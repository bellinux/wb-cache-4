5|$|According to Stodart, the fess checquy and buckles, {{prominent}} in 'MacAulay heraldry', {{are derived from}} {{the arms of the}} Stewarts. The basic <b>Stewart</b> coat of arms is blazoned: Or, a fess chequy azure and argent. The buckles used in 'Stewart heraldry' are ultimately derived from the canting arms of Alexander Boncle (d. by 1300), blazoned: gules, three buckles Or. Boncle's daughter (who in time became his heiress) married Sir John <b>Stewart</b> (d. 1298), younger son of Alexander <b>Stewart,</b> 4th High Steward of Scotland. Together the couple founded the 'Bonkyl' <b>Stewart</b> branch of the clan, and their descendants tended to use the 'Bonkyl' buckles as their heraldic differencing. One of the couple's sons, Sir Allan <b>Stewart</b> of Dreghorn (d. 1333), founded the <b>Stewart</b> of Darnley branch of the clan, which in time became the earls and dukes of Lennox.|$|E
