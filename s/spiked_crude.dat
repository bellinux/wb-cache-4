40|$|Impact {{of aging}} on {{nanoparticle}} toxicity in real matrices is scarcely investigated {{due to a}} lack of suitable methodologies. Herein, the toxicity of pristine and aged silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) to a bioluminescent Pseudomonas putida bioreporter was measured in <b>spiked</b> <b>crude</b> and final wastewater samples (CWs and FWs, respectively) collected from four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Results showed lower toxicity of pristine Ag NPs in CWs than in FWs. The effect of the matrix on the eventual Ag NP toxicity was related to multiple physico-chemical parameters (biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS) pH, ammonia, sulfide and chloride) based on a multivariate analysis. However, no collection site effect was concluded. Aged Ag NPs (up to eight weeks) were found less toxic than pristine Ag NPs in CWs; evident increased aggregation and decreased dissolution were associated with aging. However, Ag NPs exhibited consistent toxicity in FWs despite aging; comparable results were obtained in artificial wastewater (AW) simulating effluent. The study demonstrates the potency of performing nanoparticle acute toxicity testing in real and complex matrices such as wastewaters using relevant bacterial bioreporters...|$|E

The foreign exchange reserves had declined more by $10 billion {{to a level of}} $6.59 billion.|$|R
50|$|Under {{the fourth}} and the fifth {{economic}} development plans (1968-73; 1973-78), the Iranian economy became increasingly open to imports and foreign investment. A combination of oil revenues, public spending, and foreign and domestic investments enlarged the middle class in major cities, particularly Tehran. In {{the wake of the}} <b>spike</b> in <b>crude</b> oil prices that followed the 1973 war pitting Egypt and Syria against Israel, the process of industrialization and consumption grew rapidly. Between 1973 and 1977, the specialized banks provided more than 200 billion rials to the manufacturing sector, and the increase in investment averaged 56 percent per year. A flood of imported goods and raw materials overwhelmed the capacity of seaports and warehouses. The military was also a beneficiary of the new economic and social conditions. Military personnel, modern artillery and equipment, and military training absorbed {{a major part of the}} budget.|$|R
40|$|For {{several months}} now, the chronic {{political}} {{instability in the}} Niger Delta, the principal area of hydrocarbons exploita-tion in Nigeria, the world’s eleventh largest oil producer, has provided the media with spectacular stories of violence. Hardly a week goes by without an act of sabotage against an industrial facility, the kidnapping of an employee of an oil company (foreign or otherwise), or deadly clashes between security forces and militants from a complex network of heavily armed insurgency movements. Each day, {{tens of thousands of}} barrels of oil are stolen, sometimes illegally refined, and sold on the black market, robbing Nigerians of considerable revenue. It is estimated that between 100, 000 and 500, 000 additional barrels of oil per day, depending on the time period, could be produced if the country were secure. Before the current global financial crisis hit, the Niger Delta’s recurrent political problems significantly contributed to the <b>spike</b> in <b>crude</b> oil prices, in a global energy supply context that was already problematic due to political tensions in th...|$|R
40|$|Ciguatera is a {{significant}} food-borne disease caused by potent polyether toxins (ciguatoxins) which accumulate in the flesh of ciguateric reef fish at risk levels > 0. 1 ppb for Pacific ciguatoxins. Research on ciguatera has been severely hindered {{by the lack of}} analytical methods that detect and characterize low levels of ciguatoxin in crude extracts of fish. Here we report a new procedure for ciguatoxin analysis based on gradient reversed-phase HPLC/tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS/MS). The method gave a linear response to pure Pacific and Caribbean ciguatoxins (P-CTX- 1 and C-CTX- 1) and the structurally related brevetoxin (PbTx- 2) <b>spiked</b> into <b>crude</b> extracts of fish. Levels equivalent to 40 ppt P-CTX- 1, 100 ppt C-CTX- 1, and 200 ppt PbTx- 2 in fish flesh could be detected by HPLC/MS/MS. Using P-CTX- 1 as an internal standard, the analysis of extracts of 30 ciguateric fish from the Caribbean Sea (8 toxic, 12 borderline, and 10 nontoxic by mouse bioassay) confirmed the reliability of the method and allowed an estimated risk level of > 0. 25 ppb C-CTX- 1 to be established. HPLC/MS/MS provides a sensitive analytical approach, not previously available, for the determination of Pacific and Caribbean ciguatoxins at sub-ppb levels in fish flesh...|$|R
40|$|Two-dimensional gel {{electrophoresis}} (2 DE) {{is an important}} tool for investigating the complexity of snake venom proteomes. Apart from applications based on whole proteome analysis, we suggest that 2 DE {{can be used as}} an assay to guide the progress of protein purification. The aim {{of this study was to}} prove the feasibility of this concept by using it to purify rhodocetin from Calloselasma rhodostoma venom. Rhodocetin (&# 945; subunit) spot on the 2 DE profile of C. rhodostoma venom was first identified and confirmed by mass spectrometry, with a molecular mass of 16 kDa and calculated pI of 5. 16. Rhodocetin was subsequently purified by successive anion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography. Every peak from both chromatography profiles was collected and tested on 2 DE. The presence of rhodocetin (&# 945; subunit) spot in the 2 DE profile of the peak DP 2 indicated the presence of the protein. The purified compound was used to <b>spike</b> the <b>crude</b> venom. A <b>spiked</b> spot with a 1. 6 -fold increase in intensity was observed and its position matched to that of rhodocetin (&# 945; subunit) on the 2 DE profile. Together, these spots confirmed the identity of the purified compound as rhodocetin. Hence, our results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the concept we now term 2 DE-guided purification...|$|R
50|$|For a cricket net, the netting is {{the most}} {{important}} component. The net is usually manufactured in a synthetic polymer such as polyethylene, this is a hard wearing and relatively economic material. Prior to the mid-1990s nets were often made from nylon, however after the significant <b>spikes</b> in <b>crude</b> oil prices it was no longer viable to use nylon. The net will be black in colour or occasionally green. The mesh size of the net will be 50mm and will commonly have a twine diameter ranging from 1.8mm - 3.0mm. Cricket nets are supplied from a knotless or knotted netting - {{as a rule of thumb}} knotted nets are considered to be superior. It is important to understand that twine thickness of knotted and knotless nets are not directly comparable as breaking strengths of knotted nets are higher than knotless. A good standard cricket net will be UV stabilised and rot proof. For people who construct their own cricket cage, the netting is the only component which they need to purchase from a specialist supplier. Cricket netting is seamed at the edges to stop netting fraying. These seams are usually a 6mm cord sewn into the netting where it meets a cage or end. Canvas blinkers can be added to offer privacy and to reduce net wear. Also partial canvas skirts of 0.5m (at the lower portion of the netting) are added to prevent animal damage at night from creatures walking into netting and chewing out of it.|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} the proof-of-concept of the "Oil-Spill Snorkel": a novel bioelectrochemical approach {{to stimulate the}} oxidative biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in sediments. The "Oil-Spill Snorkel" consists of a single conductive material (the snorkel) positioned suitably to create an electrochemical connection between the anoxic zone (the contaminated sediment) and the oxic zone (the overlying O- 2 -containing water). The segment of the electrode buried within the sediment plays a role of anode, accepting electrons deriving from the oxidation of contaminants. Electrons flow through the snorkel up to the part exposed to the aerobic environment (the cathode), where they reduce oxygen to form water. Here we report the results of lab-scale microcosms setup with marine sediments and <b>spiked</b> with <b>crude</b> oil. Microcosms containing one or three graphite snorkels and controls (snorkel-free and autoclaved) were monitored for over 400 days. Collectively, {{the results of this}} study confirmed that the snorkels accelerate oxidative reactions taking place within the sediment, as documented by a significant 1. 7 -fold increase (p = 0. 023, two-tailed t-test) in the cumulative oxygen uptake and 1. 4 -fold increase (p = 0. 040) in the cumulative CO 2 evolution in the microcosms containing three snorkels compared to snorkel-free controls. Accordingly, the initial rate of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) degradation was also substantially enhanced. Indeed, while after 200 days of incubation a negligible degradation of TPH was noticed in snorkel-free controls, a significant reduction of 12 1 % (p = 0. 004) and 21 1 % (p = 0. 001) was observed in microcosms containing one and three snorkels, respectively. Although, the "Oil-Spill Snorkel" potentially represents a groundbreaking alternative to more expensive remediation options, further research efforts are needed to clarify factors and conditions affecting the snorkel-driven biodegradation processes and to identify suitable configurations for field applications...|$|R
40|$|Bioremediation {{of crude}} oil using biostimulation and/or {{bioaugmentation}} was done by simulation study in the green house under uncontrolled environment temperature. In this study, the soil with indigenous microbes was <b>spiked</b> with Tapis <b>crude</b> oil at 200 g/kg. The microbial density of the amended soils was augmented by addition of fresh inoculum of microbial consortium which consist of Pseudomonas aeruginosa UKMP- 14 T, Acinetobacter baumannii UKMP- 12 T and seed culture two strains of fungi, Trichoderma virens UKMP- 1 M and Trichoderma virens UKMP- 2 M at ratio 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 (v/w). The amendment soil was added with 20 % (v/w) of standardize consortium inoculum, 20 % (w/w) of dried empty fruit bunch (EFB) {{and the effect of}} EFB was compared with 0. 7 % commercial fertilizer (v/w) which contain NPK (8 : 8 : 1). Soil with indigenous microbes was used as a control. Results showed total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) degradation for treatment added with NPK fertilizer was 70. 36 %, addition with EFB bulking agent 68. 86 % and addition of both NPK and EFB was 100 % at day 30 of incubation. The control plot, 62 % of   TPH degradation was achieved after 30 days incubation...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of solid phase extraction (SPE) clean-up has been assessed to reduce matrix effects (signal suppression or enhancement) in the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC¿MS/MS) analysis of lipophilic marine toxins. A large array of ion-exchange, silica-based, and mixed-function SPE sorbents was tested. Polymeric sorbents {{were found to}} retain most of the toxins. Optimization experiments were carried out to maximize recoveries {{and the effectiveness of}} the clean-up. In LC¿MS/MS analysis, the observed matrix effects can depend on the chromatographic conditions used, therefore, two different HPLC methods were tested, using either an acidic or an alkaline mobile phase. The recovery of the optimized SPE protocol was around 90 % for all toxins studied and no break-through was observed. The matrix effects were determined by comparing signal response from toxins <b>spiked</b> in <b>crude</b> and SPE-cleaned extracts with those derived from toxins prepared in methanol. In crude extracts, all toxins suffered from matrix effects, although in varying amounts. The most serious effects were observed for okadaic acid (OA) and pectenotoxin- 2 (PTX 2) in the positive electrospray ionization mode (ESI+). SPE clean-up on polymeric sorbents in combination with the alkaline LC method resulted in a substantial reduction of matrix effects to less than 15 % (apparent recovery between 85 and 115 %) for OA, yessotoxin (YTX) in ESI¿ and azaspiracid- 1 (AZA 1), PTX 2, 13 -desmethyl spirolides C (SPX 1), and gymnodimine (GYM) in ESI+. In combination with the acidic LC method, the matrix effects after SPE were also reduced but nevertheless approximately 30 % of the matrix effects remained for PTX 2, SPX 1, and GYM in ESI+. It was concluded that SPE of methanolic shellfish extracts can be very useful for reduction of matrix effects. However, the type of LC and MS methods used is also of great importance. SPE on polymeric sorbents in combination with LC under alkaline conditions was found the most effective method...|$|R
