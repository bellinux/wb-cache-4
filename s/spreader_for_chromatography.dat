40|$|The {{very high}} thermal {{conductivity}} of diamond was first noted in measurements performed by Eucken on natural crystals in 1911. In {{the sixties and}} seventies the use of diamond as a heat <b>spreader</b> <b>for</b> the removal of thermal energy produced by semiconductor microwave devices stimulated experimental and theoretical investigations of the thermal conductivity of natural or synthetic diamond single crystals. Roughly one decade after the first measurements of thermal conductivity performed on diamond films synthesized by microwave plasma CVD the thermal conductivity of high-quality diamond films has approached that of single crystals, and the use of CVD diamond as a heat <b>spreader</b> <b>for</b> electronic and opto-electronic devices is becoming - besides tool coatings - the most important application of this material. The intent of the present article is not to give {{a review of the literature}} on the thermal conductivity of diamond single crystals and thin films. Instead it attempts to give (in chapter 2) an introduction into important models presently used to discuss the influences of various factors on the thermal conductivity of dielectric solids.

In this paper, a vapor chamber was experimentally investigated. Both the thermal resistance and the temperature uniformity of the condensing surface under different inclination angles were tested. As the inclination angle changed from 0 ° to 50 ° with 10 ° as an interval, the maximum relative change rate of thermal resistance and temperature uniformity were 9.1 % and 4.5 %, respectively. And the relative standard deviations of them were 5.5 % and 3.7 %.|$|R

50|$|Higher-quality {{stainless}} steel pressure cookers {{are made with}} heavy, three-layer, or copper-clad bottoms (heat <b>spreader)</b> <b>for</b> uniform heating because {{stainless steel}} has lower thermal conductivity. Most modern stainless steel cookers are dishwasher safe, although some manufacturers may recommend washing by hand. Some pressure cookers have a non-stick interior.A gasket or sealing ring, made from either rubber or silicone, forms a gas-tight seal that does not allow air or steam to escape between the lid and pan. Normally, the only way steam can escape is through a regulator on the lid while the cooker is pressurized. If the regulator becomes blocked, a safety valve provides a backup escape route for steam.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{operating}} {{concept of}} broadcast spreads is simple. A large material hopper is positioned over a horizontal spinning disk, the disk has {{a series of}} 3 or 4 fins attached to it which throw the dropped materials from the hopper out {{and away from the}} seeder/spreader. Alternately a pendulum spreading mechanism may be employed, this method is more common in mid-sized commercial <b>spreaders</b> <b>for</b> improved consistency in spreading. The photos clearly show the material hopper. Hoppers are commonly made of plastic, painted steel, or stainless steel. Stainless steel is usually used in large commercial units for strength and because granular fertilizer is often quite corrosive.|$|R

50|$|APG is {{primarily}} {{used as a}} heat <b>spreader</b> <b>for</b> the thermal management of high-end electronics. Due to its poor mechanical properties APG is typically encapsulated within in structural metallic materials. Aluminum is the most commonly chosen encapsulant for its strength, low mass, cost, manufacturability, and thermal conductivity. Since APG's conductivity is much lower through its thickness, thermal vias are sometimes inserted into the assembly to transfer heat into the graphite, as shown in Figure 1. These vias are typically composed of aluminum or copper. Thin, flexible sheets of APG can be encapsulated in thin flexible materials, such as polymers, aluminum foil, or copper foil to create {{what is known as}} a Thermal Strap.|$|R
40|$|Manipulation of the {{spreader}} pattern {{produced by}} spinning disc fertilizer <b>spreaders,</b> <b>for</b> site-specific applications, requires a continuous change of several spreader parameters, such as orifice position and angular {{speed of the}} disc, to keep the working width and {{the shape of the}} <b>spreader</b> pattern constant <b>for</b> varying fertilizer rates. To design an efficient control system, a model of the system is developed which takes account of spreader and particle parameters. The model is used <b>for</b> calculations of <b>spreader</b> patterns and forms the basis for further development of a spreader control system. An initial validation comparing measured and simulated spreader patterns, demonstrates that the mathematical model approximates reality quite well. By means of the model, <b>spreader</b> patterns <b>for</b> single- and twin-disc spreaders are calculated and the influence is examined of several spreader characteristics on the distribution pattern. Simulations for variations of angular velocity of the disc as well as the effects of a changing position of the orifice, referred to the driving direction, show a large effect on the spreading width and the shape of the distribution pattern. The shape of the orifice also has a large influence on the shape and the width of the distribution pattern. The simulation results further show that spreading site-specifically, simply by changing the mass flow, leads to a fluctuating spreader pattern, which results in large deviations from the intended application rates.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} analytical solution {{using the}} method of Fourier expansion is developed for determination of the spreading thermal resistance of a cubic heat <b>spreader</b> <b>for</b> electronic cooling applications. The model assumes that the heat spreader is receiving a uniform heat flux centroidally with a projected heating area from the heat source. Heat is conducted inside the heat spreader in a three-dimensional coordinate, then transferred to a heat sink with a constant convective heat transfer coefficient. Dimensionless expressions {{in the form of}} infinite series are provided to compute the maximum spreading thermal resistance, the surface temperature fields and the heat flux distribution as a function of relative projected heating area, plate thickness and Biot number. The correlation developed herein is effective and accurate to predict the spreading thermal resistance. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
