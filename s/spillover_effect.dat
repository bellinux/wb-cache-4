5|$|Although {{there was}} a {{consensus}} {{in the scientific community}} about how it was possible for the brain's neural circuitry to change through experience, the potential effect of web technologies on the brain's neural circuitry was unknown. On the topic of the Internet's effect on reading skills, Guinevere F. Eden, director of the Center for the Study of Learning at Georgetown University, remarked that the question was whether or not the Internet changed the brain {{in a way that was}} beneficial to an individual. Carr believed that the effect of the Internet on cognition was detrimental, weakening the ability to concentrate and contemplate. Olds cited the potential benefits of computer software that specifically targets learning disabilities, stating that among some neuroscientists {{there was a}} belief that neuroplasticity-based software was beneficial in improving receptive language disorders. Olds mentioned neuroscientist Michael Merzenich, who had formed several companies with his peers in which neuroplasticity-based computer programs had been developed to improve the cognitive functioning of kids, adults and the elderly. In 1996, Merzenich and his peers had started a company called Scientific Learning in which neuroplastic research had been used to develop a computer training program called Fast ForWord that offered seven brain exercises that improved language impairments and learning disabilities in children. Feedback on Fast ForWord showed that these brain exercises even had benefits for autistic children, an unexpected <b>spillover</b> <b>effect</b> that Merzenich has attempted to harness by developing a modification of Fast ForWord specifically designed for autism. At a subsequent company that Merzenich started called Posit Science, Fast ForWord-like brain exercises and other techniques were developed with the aim of sharpening the brains of elderly people by retaining the plasticity of their brains.|$|E

There are five important findings of this study: (1) there is indication of a positive productivity spillover from FDI on local firms; (2) the labour-intensive industries tend to receive negative <b>spillover</b> <b>effects,</b> whereas the capital-intensive industries tend to gain positive spillover effects; (3) the total factor productivity growth (TFPG) of firms in East Java is sourced mainly from the scale efficiency change (SEC); (4) the <b>spillover</b> <b>effects</b> of FDI are mainly scale-efficiency knowledge and technological knowledge; (5) the technical efficiency knowledge tends to be a long-run effect rather than a short-run...|$|R

Failure to have such an evaluation design can result in wrong policy recommendations and in the neglect of important mechanisms through which the program operates.

This often means selecting the control groups from different geographic units (e. g. the village or school). In order to understand the mechanisms that cause <b>spillover</b> <b>effects</b> one has to think about competing explanations and collect data on relevant outcomes.

40|$|Measurement of the <b>spillover</b> <b>effects</b> of {{research}} has drawn significant attention in recent years. Three aspects of <b>spillover</b> <b>effects</b> — <b>spillover</b> as an input in the research policy debate, as an input to support research management decisionmakers, and as an input in the fine-tuning {{of research}} evaluation methodology — {{are very important to}} understand (Davis 1991). Consideration of the <b>spillover</b> <b>effects</b> has significant implications for research policy design and evaluation of research benefits. Research systems generate technologies for target environments and commodities. However, the outcome of a research effort often impacts an area wider than the target. Thus, research systems generate two types of benefits for their investors: direct and <b>spillover</b> <b>effects.</b> Conventional research evaluation considers only the direct benefits and ignores the spillover. As a result, output from research is underestimated. So when policymakers decide on the level of investment to be made in research, they are likely to do so on the basis of such underestimated benefits. Therefore, the investment is likely to be less than optimum. If, however, <b>spillover</b> <b>effects</b> were quantified, they would help in making research investment decisions more attuned with the needs. Incorporation of <b>spillover</b> <b>effects</b> in the research policy design would also enhance the transparency of the decision-making process. Research <b>spillover</b> <b>effects</b> also {{have an impact on the}} competitiveness of farmers in different regions and countries. National research planning tends to underestimate returns to research by not considering <b>spillover</b> <b>effects</b> and, therefore, tends to underinvest in research. International research support, whether bilateral, regional or multilateral, is normally designed to complement national research activities and to generate maximum international rather than national research benefits. It selects research portfolios with an explicit consideration of the likely spillover benefits for countries with similar agroclimatic and socioeconomic environments...|$|R
