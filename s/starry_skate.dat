50|$|Beringraja stellulata, the Pacific <b>starry</b> <b>skate,</b> rock skate, prickly skate or <b>starry</b> <b>skate,</b> is {{a species}} of {{cartilaginous}} fish in the family Rajidae. It is found on rocky bottoms at 18-982 m depths (typically 70-150 m) in the Northeast and Eastern Central Pacific, from Coronado Bank in northern Baja California in Mexico to Barkley Sound in British Columbia, Canada. Females reach a maximum total length of 76.1 cm and a maximum age of 15 years, while males can be up to 71.7 cm long and live up to 14 years; the total length at birth is 15.5-22.5 cm. This skate prefers cold water with a temperature of 4.1-11.6 °C (average 8.9 °C).|$|E
50|$|Raja stellulata, or the Pacific <b>Starry</b> <b>Skate</b> have a row {{of strong}} spines along their mid-dorsal line. They also have large spines on their {{shoulder}} girdle. A row of small spines {{is located on the}} inner edge of the orbit of the Raja stellulata. Clusters of moderate spines are also located {{along the edge of the}} pectoral fin. <b>Starry</b> <b>skate</b> males also have a large spine. The dorsal and caudal fins are small. The anal fin is absent in starry skates. The pectoral fins are broad and attached to the snout and incorporated with the body. Pelvic fins are large and deeply notched. Starry skates have a horizontal fleshy ridge from either side of the ventral surface to the tail, this is more prominent in the posterior. Raja stellulata are a grayish brown color with numerous dark spots of various sizes scattered on the body with a weakly marked eye spots that is often present at the base of the pectoral fins.|$|E
5000|$|The Antarctic <b>starry</b> <b>skate</b> (Amblyraja georgiana) is {{a species}} of fish in the Rajidae family. It lives near the seabed in depths ranging from 20 to 350 metres in the Southeast Pacific near Chile and {{occasionally}} around Greenland and around the Barents Sea. Its maximum size is 1 metre. It produces oblong egg capsules which have four sharp thorns in each corner and which measure 116.5 mm long and 80.0 mm wide ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Starry</b> <b>skates</b> {{are known}} to live on hard {{substrate}} near rocky reefs. They {{can also be found}} on soft sediment, however they are more commonly found on rocky surfaces. They are found at depths of 18-982 m. Within these depths, they are most commonly found in depths of 70-150m.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>starry</b> <b>skate</b> is oviparous. They have a {{generation}} length of 8-12 years. The egg cases of starry skates are striated and have long, robust horns. Raja stellulata can reproduce year round {{and do not}} have a distinct cycle. Their size at birth is 15.5-22.5 cm total length. The young tend to follow large objects, which may be their mother. The length at first maturity in females is 47.4 cm and 9 years of age. At 100% maturity, females reach the length of 69.2 cm and are 15 years old. The length at first maturity for males is 46.0 cm and 6 years old. Males are 65.8 cm and 13 years old when they reach 100% maturity.|$|E
40|$|Stomach {{contents}} {{were identified}} from 206 Antarctic <b>starry</b> <b>skate</b> (Amblyraja georgiana) that were collected during three groundfish surveys (September 2007, April 2008 and January 2009) at South Georgia, Southern Ocean. The diet of A. georgiana varied with skate size and between years. Preferred prey included fish (particularly for larger individuals) and Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, {{as well as}} amphipods, polychaetes and other benthic fauna. The skate A. georgiana {{appears to be an}} opportunistic predator, and the clear presence of Antarctic krill in this demersal predator’s diet may indicate a benthic habit of this euphausiid species, which has hitherto mainly been considered as occupying a purely pelagic niche...|$|E
40|$|Since 1988 Greenland Institute of Natural Resources {{annually}} {{has conducted}} a bottom trawl survey off West Greenland. The {{main purpose of}} the survey is to evaluate the biomass and abundance of Northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis), but data on most fish spices have been recorded. This paper presents biomass and abundance estimates together with length frequencies of cod, Greenland halibut, redfish, wolffishes, American plaice and <b>starry</b> <b>skate</b> from the 2001 survey. Further, a recruitment index for Greenland halibut is presented. Materials and Methods The survey covers the offshore areas at West Greenland between 59 ° 00 'N and 72 ° 30 'N from the 3 -mile limit to the 600 m depth contour line and the inshore area Disko Bay (Figure 1 and Table 1). The survey area is divided into NAFO Divisions, which were further subdivided into three depth strata (0 - 200, 201 - 400 and 401 - 600 m) on basis of depth contour lines. The area surveyed has, however, changed throughout the years. From 1988 to 1990 the survey area included Div...|$|E
40|$|The Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fishes) are {{commonly}} accepted as being sister {{group to the}} other extant Gnathostomata (jawed vertebrates). To clarify gnathostome relationships and to aid in resolving and dating the major piscine divergences, we have sequenced the complete mtDNA of the <b>starry</b> <b>skate</b> and have included it in phylogenetic analysis along with three squalomorph chondrichthyans—the common dogfish, the spiny dogfish, and the star spotted dogfish—and a number of bony fishes and amniotes. The direction of evolution within the gnathostome tree was established by rooting it with the most closely related non-gnathostome outgroup, the sea lamprey, {{as well as with}} some more distantly related taxa. The analyses placed the chondrichthyans in a terminal position in the piscine tree. These findings, which also suggest that the origin of the amniote lineage is older than the age of the oldest extant bony fishes (the lungfishes), challenge the evolutionary direction of several morphological characters that have been used in reconstructing gnathostome relationships. Applying as a calibration point the age of the oldest lungfish fossils, 400 million years, the molecular estimate placed the squalomorph/batomorph divergence at ≈ 190 million years before present. This dating is consistent with the occurrence of the earliest batomorph (skates and rays) fossils in the paleontological record. The split between gnathostome fishes and the amniote lineage was dated at ≈ 420 million years before present...|$|E
40|$|Since 1991, the {{aggregate}} biomass of fish stocks inhabiting the West Greenland shelf stagnates {{at the lowest}} level. The latest survey results of cruise no. 152 conducted by FRV 'Walther Herwig III' do not indicate any improvements in state of the stocks, although no fishing effort was recently directed towards groundfish. The cod stock showed again a record low and is presently dominated by recruits of the year classes 1991 and 1993. Both year classes {{are considered to be}} weak and the cod stock is beyond the 'minimum biologically acceptable level'. Consequently, an increase in stock abundance is not expected either in short or long term. Other ecologically or economically important fish species, American plaice, redfish, wolffish and <b>starry</b> <b>skate,</b> were also found to have minimum stock abundances. By-catch estimates of juvenile groundfish taken by the shrimp fishery, operating at traditional grounds of cod and redfish fisheries, are indispensible. Analysis of climatological data from Nuuk/West Greenland indicates that climate during the past fourty years was characterized by two decades of anomalous warm conditions, and cooling which dominates the dimate since 1969. Anomalous cold events were encountered during 1983, 1984 and during 1992, 1993. Similar to the air temperature anomalies, autumn temperatures of the ocean surface layer indicate cold and warm periods during the past thirty years. In contrast to the colder than normal atmospheric conditions during the early nineties, however, the ocean conditions indicate intermediate warming...|$|E
40|$|The order Rajiformes, or skates, is a morphologically {{conservative}} {{group that}} exhibits {{a wide range}} of life history characteristics. This inter-species variability warrants species-specific research. This study investigates the age, growth, reproduction, and habitat of the <b>Starry</b> <b>Skate,</b> Raja stellulata, which is endemic to the U. S. West Coast. Age and growth parameters were determined using two preparation techniques: gross sectioning and histological sectioning. The assumption that gross sections deposit one band pair a year was indirectly validated with centrum edge analysis and marginal increment ratio. It was not indirectly validated with histological sections. Age estimates from gross sections ranged from 0 to 11 years, and growth was best described by the two parameter von Bertalanffy growth function in which L∞ = 865 mm TL and k = 0. 15. Age estimates from histological sections ranged from 0 to 15 years, and growth was best described by the Gompertz function in which L∞ = 845 mm TL, g = 0. 15, and k = 1. 53. Histological section results are recommended for describing growth of R. stellulata because the longevity is more conservative. Raja stellulata exhibits year-round reproduction and attains 50 % maturity at 632 mm TL, and 11. 2 years old for females and 603 mm TL, and 11. 5 years for males. Raja stellulata was collected most often on hard substrate between 70 and 150 m depth. An age/depth trend within the central California skate assemblage was found where increased habitat depth correlated with increased longevity...|$|E
40|$|Fishes (Superclass Pisces) {{constitute}} the most numerous and morphologically diverse vertebrate group, yet {{only a small}} fraction of all molecular evolutionary studies concern piscine evolution. This thesis aims to investigate the vertebrate tree, through the analysis of mitochondrial (mt) DNA sequences. To this end the coding regions of the mt genome of a jawless fish, the hagfish (Myxine glutinosa), were sequenced, along with the complete mt genomes of two elasmobranch (cartilaginous) fishes, the spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) and the <b>starry</b> <b>skate</b> (Raja radiata). Phylogenetic analyses were carried out on both on amino acid and nucleotide sequences and using both the jawless fishes (the hagfish, Myxine glutinosa, and the sea lamprey, Petromyzon marinus). The ?Cyclostomata hypothesis?-which states that hagfishes and lampreys constitute a monophyletic group-was tested against the ?Vertebrate hypothesis?, but neither hypothesis could be statistically rejected. The third possible hypothesis-that hagfishes are the sister group of the jawed vertebrates-was however rejected in all analyses. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the branching order and the evolutionary direction of the fishes was inverted compared to the traditional view on vertebrate evolution. In addition, all of the jawed fishes fell into one group while the amniotes formed a second, distinct group, as opposed to all of the taxa forming one large group as in the traditional tree. This finding suggests that the origin of extant aminotes predated the diversification of extant gnathostomous (jawed) fishes and therefore, if this topology is indeed the correct one, the ancestor of extant amniotes was not more closely related to the lungfish or the coelacanth lineages than to any other extant fishes. In addition to the jawless fishes a number of invertebrates (lancelet and echinoderms) were used to root the vertebrate tree. Irrespective of which invertebrate outgroups were used, the same tree polarity and the same phylogenetic relationship among piscine and amniote taxa were reconstructed. These findings could not be related to violations of the assumptions used in the phylogenetic reconstruction nor could they be ascribed to any random error (due to limited sample size) in the data set. The sequences of two elasmobranchs were used to investigate the relationship between cartilaginous and bony fishes. In contrast with all previous mtDNA studies the cartilaginous fishes were not found to be basal among jawed vertebrates, but instead fell in a crown position among the fishes, constituting the sister group to the teleosts. This terminal position of the elasmobranchs was well-supported in all of the analyses. Rooting the tree with the cartilaginous fishes resulted in the traditional vertebrate tree. This is however an operation inconsistent with the principle of unquestionable outgroup rooting, since cartilaginous fishes have not clearly been shown to be the most basal gnathostomous group. The reconstructed crown position of the elasmobranchs together with their questionable use as an outgroup confirms that rooting, using cartilaginous fishes, is probably the cause for the incongruent topologies reconstructed. This thesis deals with these new, molecular findings, their implications for vertebrate phylogeny and evolution and the validity of the traditional views...|$|E
