5000|$|The former ASTM F1677 was {{the test}} method for the Brungraber Mark II (also known as Portable Inclinable Articulated Strut Tribometer or PIAST) device, {{and the former}} ASTM F1679 test method was written for the English XL Variable Incidence Tribometer (VIT). Shortly after being {{published}} in 2004, ASTM withdrew these standards in 2006, with no replacement. (They are still available for purchase from ASTM as a withdrawn or [...] "historical" [...] standard.) Regarding ASTM F1679, ASTM provides the following 'withdrawn rationale': [...] "Formerly {{under the jurisdiction of}} Committee F13 on Pedestrian/Walkway <b>Safety</b> and <b>Footwear,</b> this test method was withdrawn as an active ASTM standard by action of the Committee of Standards (COS) on September 30, 2006 for failure to include an approved precision statement (violating Section A21 of the Form and Style for ASTM Standards), and for including reference to proprietary apparatus where alternatives exist (violating Section 15 of the Regulations Governing ASTM Technical Committees)." [...] ASTM offers the following, similar 'withdrawn rationale' for F1677: [...] "Formerly under the jurisdiction of Committee F13 on Pedestrian/Walkway <b>Safety</b> and <b>Footwear,</b> this test method was withdrawn as an active ASTM standard by action of the Committee of Standards (COS) on September 30, 2006 for failure to include an approved precision statement (violating Section A21 of the Form and Style for ASTM Standards), and for including reference to proprietary apparatus where alternatives exist (violating Section 15 of the Regulations Governing ASTM Technical Committees)." [...] Using these two instruments, different test labs got very different answers on identical tiles in interlaboratory studies, meaning these test methods (or devices) were unreliable and unable to provide [...] "reasonable precision statements". The English XL is still used widely in the U.S., mostly by professional expert witnesses, who have discovered that the result of the test can be greatly influenced by how the actuating button is pressed by the user. This problem of precision can be used to their advantage in legal issues regarding slips and falls.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Nowadays, {{trades and}} {{research}} have become closely related between different countries and anthropometric data {{are important for}} the development in global markets. The appropriate use of anthropometry may improve wellbeing, health, comfort and <b>safety</b> especially for <b>footwear</b> design. For children a proper fit of footwear is very important, not constraining foot growth and allowing a normal development. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the anthropometric characteristics of German and Brazilian children’s feet from 3 to 10  years of age. Methods We compared five indirect measures of two databases of children's feet. Forefoot, midfoot and rearfoot widths were measured in static footprints and the Chippaux-Smirak and Staheli indices of the longitudinal arch were calculated. Results Brazilian children showed a significantly narrower forefoot from 5 to 10  years, wider rearfoot from 3 to 4  years, wider midfoot for 4  year-olds and narrower midfoot for 10  year-old children. Nevertheless, the Chippaux-Smirak and Staheli indices showed no group differences. The only exception was for 4  year-old Brazilian children who showed a higher Chippaux-Smirak index compared to German children (48. 4 [*]±[*] 17. 7 %; 42. 1 [*]±[*] 13. 8 %). Conclusions Our study revealed anthropometric differences in absolute forefoot and rearfoot widths of German and Brazilian children, but a similar longitudinal arch development. At 4  years of age, Brazilian children present a foot anthropometry similar to the 3  year-olds and develop the plantar longitudinal arch from 4 to 5  years more rapidly when compared to German children...|$|R

40|$|Product {{diversification}} is a usual {{strategy of}} footwear producers. As a requirement related to competitiveness in this domain, diversification {{can be done}} by practical application of some criteria. Considering this aspect, the paper proposes a research on the diversification {{in the case of a}} <b>safety</b> <b>footwear</b> product by modifying its component patterns, while keeping the initial shape of the product. Thus, starting from a safety shoe model, diversification was performed by changing the configuration in the joining area of two patterns of the product.

The size of the set presents a significant influence on the theoretical nesting factor and implicitly on the size of the wastes. The analysis of the resulting new model types lead to highlighting the influence of the patterns number of the uppers and the area of the set on the usage index of the leather surface when cutting the parts and on the specific consumption. ...|$|E
40|$|Shoe soles are {{extremely}} complex {{to design and}} manufacture due to their organically shaped but technically precise nature and their manufacturing constraints. Consequently, {{there is a need}} for the increased design process flexibility offered by the use of specific CAD methodologies and techniques, to facilitate the work of expert designers and permit effective construction of the three-dimensional elements comprising the complete structure. Recent advances in additive manufacturing systems have extended the possibilities of shoe sole design. These systems can be used to create the final mould and to incorporate dynamic elements that are of particular value in sports footwear. In this article, we present a new methodology for the design and validation of shoe soles. The methodology assists designers in the design concept process and in transfer of the design to manufacturing. The model incorporates both a structural and a functional approach. To this end, a set of specific tools have been developed that can be used to quantify design quality. For example, the model calculates the coefficient of friction or slip resistance, necessary to comply with international standards concerning <b>safety</b> <b>footwear.</b> The financial support of this study comes from IVACE (Instituto Valenciano de Competitividad Empresarial) project: DIHUCA—complex tread designs for footwear soles (IMDEEA/ 2015 / 4) ...|$|E

Both models were manufactured in two variants - with and without steel toe cap. The boot insulation was measured with an artificial, heated foot (AHF). One model was used in experiment with subjects (n= 6). Cold exposure consisted of sitting for 60 minutes at - 10 °C. There were no differences between insulation levels of boots with and without steel cap for one boot model, but the differences were statistically significant for the second model showing slightly higher insulation values for the boot without steel cap. No significant differences due to insulation dissimilarities could be found from the measurements on subjects. Statistically {{significant differences were found}} for both models regarding the rate of change of heat loss from AHF when its location was changed from warm to cold and back to warm. The rise and decrease of heat loss from AHF depended on the rate of temperature change of the boots.
