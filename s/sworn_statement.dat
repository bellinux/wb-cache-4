5|$|The next {{incident}} {{proved to}} be a major event in the coming of the American Revolution. On the evening of May 9, 1768, Hancock's sloop Liberty arrived in Boston Harbor, carrying a shipment of Madeira wine. When custom officers inspected the ship the next morning, they found that it contained 25 pipes of wine, just one fourth of the ship's carrying capacity. Hancock paid the duties on the 25 pipes of wine, but officials suspected that he had arranged to have more wine unloaded during the night to avoid paying the duties for the entire cargo. They did not have any evidence to prove this, however, since the two tidesmen who had stayed on the ship overnight gave a <b>sworn</b> <b>statement</b> that nothing had been unloaded.|$|E
5|$|The High Court's {{decision}} was overruled by the Court of Appeal. The Court {{held that the}} Registrar had given genuine consideration to Komoco's arguments. It found that the Registrar had been entitled to take, prima facie, the Customs' OMV figures as correct unless they had {{been shown to be}} incorrect. Although the Registrar had been disposed to follow the Customs' OMV, she had equally been concerned to find out whether there had been sufficient reasons for her not to follow the administrative convention. Komoco had neither challenged the sworn evidence given by the Registrar by applying to cross-examine her, nor adduced any evidence to disprove the Registrar's <b>sworn</b> <b>statement.</b> There was thus no merit in Komoco's contention that the Registrar had not given genuine consideration to its representation. Furthermore, Komoco had not provided new evidence not already presented to the Customs to justify a departure from the administrative convention. Therefore, there had not been any compelling reason for the Registrar to re-evaluate her decision. She had adequately justified her refusal to depart from the policy, and had not fettered her discretion.|$|E

25|$|With popular feeling against Communism {{raging in}} the wake of European events and {{political}} heat rising in Washington, the Justice Department moved to action. On October 23 a federal grand jury in Manhattan indicted Browder for passport fraud, a felony. The formal charge against him specified that Browder had made multiple returns to the United States using a passport bearing his own name, but which had been obtained {{on the basis of a}} falsely <b>sworn</b> <b>statement.</b> Indictments of CPUSA treasurer Wiliam Wiener and Young Communist League leader Harry Gannes on passport charges followed in December, and the Communist Party sent several of its top leaders into hiding in anticipation of a broader crackdown.|$|E

25|$|The {{prosecutor}} called Joseph Faulkner, {{a tailor}} who knew Whelan in Montreal, {{hoping that he}} would testify about Whelan's Fenian connections; while he said he recollected Whelan being angered by McGee during the election season, which was contradicted by other witnesses who claimed Whelan showed no interest in politics, {{he said there was}} no known Fenian connection. Another witness identified as Turner testified that he had heard a member of parliament mention that the government had offered Doyle $16,000 and passage to anywhere in the world to restart his life, if he would make a <b>sworn</b> <b>statement</b> against Whelan. However Susan Wheatley later testified that she had heard Turner say he would swear his grandfather's life away for $10,000 or $20,000 and no mention was made of Doyle. Later witnesses were actually directly asked to swear whether they had received any money for their testimony.|$|E
25|$|In January, 2009, Carlos Alberto Torres was {{scheduled}} for a parole hearing, after serving 29 years behind bars. On {{the eve of his}} hearing, prison authorities accused him and eight of his cellmates of possessing knives which the tenth cellmate had hidden in the light fixture of the cell. On July 28, the Parole board notified Carlos Alberto that they would postpone their decision for at least 90 days, pending resolution of the charges. Two days later, the prison disciplinary hearing officer held hearings on the weapons charges. Alberto's defense consisted not merely of his statement denying possession. The tenth cellmate appeared as a witness, admitting that the knives were his, and his alone, and that Carlos Alberto and none of the other cellmates knew he had hidden the knives in the light fixture. The guilty party also provided a <b>sworn</b> <b>statement</b> to this effect. The disciplinary hearing officer nevertheless found them guilty of possessing the hidden weapons.|$|E
25|$|The {{most famous}} {{aspect of the}} {{production}} is Craig's use of a single, plain set that varied from scene to scene by means of large, abstract screens that altered {{the size and shape}} of the acting area. There is a persistent theatrical myth that these screens were impractical and fell over during the first performance. This myth may be traced to a passage in Stanislavski's My Life in Art (1924); Craig demanded that Stanislavski delete the story and Stanislavski admitted that the incident occurred only during a rehearsal. He eventually provided Craig with a <b>sworn</b> <b>statement</b> that the mishap was due to an error by the stage-hands and not the design of Craig's screens. The screens had been built ten feet taller than Craig's designs specified, which may have also contributed to the mishap. Craig had envisaged specially costumed, visible stage-hands to move the screens, but Stanislavski had rejected the idea. This forced a curtain close and delay between scenes, which disrupted the sense of fluidity and movement inherent to Craig's conception. The different arrangements of the screens for each scene were used to provide a spatial representation of Hamlet's state of mind or to underline a dramaturgical progression across a sequence of scenes, as visual elements were retained or transformed. In terms of costume design there were also differences between the two artists. For example, in the scene containing the dumb show Craig wished for the Actors to wear oversized masks, but Stanislavski despised this idea as it did not ring true to a realistic style of acting. Eventually there was a compromise which allowed the actors to wear makeup along with extravagant beards and wigs (Innes 158).|$|E
50|$|Before the trial, {{occupation}} authorities reclassified {{the defendants}} from {{prisoners of war}} to Civilian Internees.

5000|$|Spitzer {{defended the}} {{decision}} not to provide testimony, saying that it was not necessary for Baum and Dopp to be questioned after Cuomo determined no crime was committed. The attorney general's office said investigators rejected the <b>sworn</b> <b>statements</b> of Dopp and Baum since both men refused to testify, and some observers have noted this has left several questions unanswered. These omissions have prompted speculation that the governor may have been involved in some way. Jeffrey Lerner, a spokesman for the Attorney General, stated that [...] "We told the Governor's Counsel's office that we wanted to interview Darren Dopp and Richard Baum. The Governor's Counsel's office declined and instead sent <b>sworn</b> written <b>statements.</b> We had no power to compel testimony," [...] and that [...] "our investigators decided not (to) include the written statements as they did not have the chance to interview Dopp and Baum." [...] The Governor said that the written statements by Baum and Dopp were [...] "sufficient for the attorney general to close its investigation," [...] and reiterated that he was not involved in the decision to not have Baum and Dopp testify before Cuomo. Still, their <b>sworn</b> <b>statements</b> were not accepted for use in the report.|$|R

Pegram had known Booth well as a young man; he submitted a <b>sworn</b> <b>statement</b> that the body which {{he had seen in}} 1869 was Booth's. Others positively identified this body as Booth at the funeral home, including Booth's mother, brother, and sister, along with his dentist and other Baltimore acquaintances. Earlier, The New York Times had {{published an}} account by their reporter in 1911 detailing the burial of Booth's body at the cemetery and those who were witnesses.
