40|$|In recent years, the {{confocal}} and two photon microscopes {{have become}} ubiquitous tools in life science laboratories. The {{reason for this}} is that both these systems can acquire three dimensional image data from biological specimens. Specifically, this is done by acquiring a series of two-dimensional images from a set of equally spaced planes within the specimen. The resulting image stack can be manipulated and displayed on a computer to reveal a wealth of information. These systems can also be used in time lapse studies to monitor the dynamical behaviour of specimens by recording a number of image stacks at a sequence of time points. The time resolution in this situation is, however, limited by the maximum speed at which each constituent image stack can be acquired. Various techniques have emerged to speed up image acquisition and in most practical implementations a single, in-focus, image can be acquired very quickly. However, the real bottleneck in three dimensional imaging is the process of refocusing the system to image different planes. This is commonly done by physically changing the distance between the specimen and imaging lens, which is a relatively slow process. It is clear with the ever-increasing need to image biologically relevant specimens quickly that the speed limitation imposed by the refocusing process must be overcome. This thesis concerns the acquisition of data from a range of <b>specimen</b> <b>depths</b> without requiring the specimen to be moved. A new technique is demonstrated for two photon microscopy that enables data from a whole range of <b>specimen</b> <b>depths</b> to be acquired simultaneously so that a single two dimensional scan records extended depth of field image data directly. This circumvents the need to acquire a full three dimensional image stack and hence leads to a significant improvement in the temporal resolution for acquiring such data by more than an order of magnitude. In the remainder of this thesis, a new microscope architecture is presented that enables scanning to be carried out in three dimensions at high speed without moving the objective lens or specimen. Aberrations introduced by the objective lens are compensated by the introduction of an equal and opposite aberration with a second lens within the system enabling diffraction limited performance over a large range of <b>specimen</b> <b>depths.</b> Focusing is achieved by moving a very small mirror, allowing axial scan rates of several kHz; an improvement of some two orders of magnitude. This approach is extremely general and can be applied to any form of optical microscope with the very great advantage that the specimen is not disturbed. This technique is developed theoretically and experimental results are shown that demonstrate its potential application to a broad range of sectioning methods in microscopy.

To assess low-flux limitations a theoretical model is used to derive an analytical expression for the minimum variance bound.

It is concluded that approximately 14 nm depth resolution is achievable with flux levels available when tracking fluorescent sources in three dimensions in live-cell biology and that the method is suitable for three-dimensional photo-activated localization microscopy resolution.

The wedge splitting (WS) test {{is now a}} promising method to perform stable fracture mechanics tests on concrete-like quasi brittle materials. Fracture parameters, such as fracture toughness and critical crack opening displacement and et. al, are however not easy to determined since formulae available from stress intensity factor manual are restricted to standard specimen geometry. The paper attempts to compute expressions for commonly used fracture parameters for a general wedge splitting specimen. By means of finite element analysis program, test simulation was performed on non-standard wedge splitting specimen with different depth and initiation crack length, and thereafter expressions were proposed for stress intensity factor at the pre-cast tip and crack mouth opening displacement on the load line. Based on the work above, size effect on the unstable fracture toughness and crack extension were investigated, and the consistency of fracture toughness data for various <b>specimen</b> <b>depth</b> as well as initiation crack length is demonstrated.

The photodegradation of PVC and WPVC composites under natural weathering conditions were lower than those under accelerated weathering conditions.

The state of stress was examined in a standard steel tensile test specimen that had been previously ground and then statically loaded with an effective strain of 0. 45 % and 1 %, respectively. Stress measurements were carried out by the sin 2 ψ method with a ψ-diffractometer and using KαCo radiation. The classical version of this method and a version with a fixed angle of incidence of X-ray radiation applied onto the steel surface were used, alternatively. Based on the reflection from plane (211), the stresses in steel sub-surface layers of different thickness, as determined from the depth of X-ray penetration (with the classical θ-θ method and the fixed incidence angle method at α= 30 °, combined with the material layer stripping method), were calculated. It has been demonstrated that the determination of the stress distribution over the <b>specimen</b> <b>depth</b> based on a single method of radiation exposure providing the identical depth of penetration into the material gives as a result a distribution curve that is shifted toward either the lower or higher stresses. The use of two (or more) methods of radiation exposure from two (or more) effective depths of penetration into the material from the same testing surface enables the gradients of stresses in the material sub-surface layers to be determined and, what is the most important, their averaged values will define a stress distribution in the specimen, which will be closer to the actual stress distribution...|$|E
40|$|The {{fracture}} toughness testing of A 285 carbon steel storage tank material was carried out. A series of single edge-notched bend (SENB) specimens with various constraint levels were used. The variation of crack tip constraint {{was achieved by}} changing {{the ratio of the}} initial notch length to the <b>specimen</b> <b>depth.</b> The test data show that the J-R curves are specimen-dependent, which is known as the constraint effect. A two-parameter fracture methodology is adopted to construct a constraint-modified J-R curve, which {{is a function of the}} constraint parameter, A 2, while J remains the loading parameter. This additional fracture parameter is derived from a closed form solution and can be extracted from the finite element analysis for a specific crack configuration. Using this set of SENB test data, a mathematical expression for the J-R curve of the A 285 carbon steel can be developed. It is shown that the predicted J-R curves match well with the SENB data over an extensive amount of crack growth. In addition, this expression of the constraint modified J-R curve is used to predict the test data of a compact tension specimen (CT), and good agreement can be achieved. To demonstrate its application in the structural integrity assessment, a generic A 285 storage tank with a postulated axial flaw is used. For a flaw length of 10 percent of the tank height, the predicted J-R curve is found to be similar to that for a SENB specimen with a short notch, which is in a state of low constraint. This implies that the use of traditional J-R curve, which is typically obtained by high constraint specimens, may be overly conservative...|$|E

40|$|The shear {{strengths}} of structural glued laminated timber (glulam) have been traditionally evaluated in the United States {{based on the}} procedures set forth in ASTM Standards D 3737 and D 2555 using small block shear values of clear wood specimens. For most glulam products, the design shear stresses so derived are conservative. In recent years, the demand to optimize the design shear stress has been increased due to a higher design shear stress offered by competing structural wood composites, such as laminated veneer lumber (LVL) and parallel strand lumber (PSL). Since 1997, APA has {{conducted a series of}} full-size shear tests on glulam manufactured with Douglas fir, Southern pine, and Spruce-Pine-Fir. A four-point load method with a clear distance between the edge of the reaction bearing plate {{to the edge of the}} nearest curved load bearing block of at least 2 times the <b>specimen</b> <b>depth</b> was used to test all specimens. Based on this experience, the full-size shear test method has been adopted in ASTM D 3737 as a standard test method for determining the horizontal shear strength of glulam. This paper provides detailed descriptions of the test methods, experimental results, and data analyses. The test results obtained from this study indicate that the characteristic shear strength values based on full-size shear tests are approximately 70 % of the values determined from small block shear tests. However, the allowable horizontal shear stress could be increased by a factor of at least 1. 25, including a 10 % reduction to allow for occasional seasoning checks. This increase can be attributed in part to the difference in the procedures used to derive the design value between the full-size and small block shear tests...|$|E
40|$|In the Unites States, the {{allowable}} {{horizontal shear}} stresses of structural glued laminated timber (glulam) have been traditionally determined {{based on the}} procedures set forth in ASTM Standards D 3737 and D 2555 using block shear values of small-clear wood specimens as the basis. In recent years, however, information has been generated, suggesting that the allowable shear stresses so derived may be overly conservative {{when compared to the}} results of full-size flexure tests. Unfortunately, all available U. S. data on full-size glulam tests, as related to shear strength, were either proprietary or conducted using a non standard test method. Moreover, the different test setups used by these studies made the data comparison difficult. A systematic evaluation on major wood species used in the production of glulam in the U. S. based on a consistent full-size flexure test method was considered critical by the U. S. glulam industry to determine the appropriate allowable horizontal shear stresses for glulam. During 1996 - 97, APA- The Engineered Wood Association conducted a total of 201 full-size tests on glulam manufactured with Douglas fir, Southern pine, and Spruce-Pine-Fir. A two-point load method with a clear distance between the edge of the reaction bearing plate {{to the edge of the}} nearest curved loading block of at least 2 times the <b>specimen</b> <b>depth</b> was used to test all specimens.

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. December 2013. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: Francis A. Kulacki. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 111 pages. The {{objective of this}} research is to design a satisfactory analytical and experimental model so as to determine the heat generated during the process of polymerization in the light-activated composite dental resin materials in the process of restoration of cavities in teeth. When the curing light is subjected at the top surface of the composite resin, the overall temperature at the pulp-dentine junction increases. This temperature rise is due to the generation of heat within the composite resin. The energy released by the light activation unit along with the exothermic polymerization reaction, which occurs within the monomer molecules of the resin compound, increases the temperature at the pulp-dentin junction. With the increase of the temperature beyond a certain scale (~ 20 oF),the condition of the nerves and blood vessel at the pulp-dentin junction deteriorates in 60 % of cases studied, and the pulp fails to recover from the intra-pulpal temperature increase. A major conclusion is that the restorative resin compound which produces the minimum temperature rise over the time-period of curing, ~ 40 s is the best composite to use for dental restoration purpose. In this paper the temperature rise due to polymerization for the three composite dental resins such as, 3 M TM ESPE TM Z 100 TM Restorative, Filtek TM LS Low Shrink Posterior Restorative System, and 3 MTM ESPETM Filtek Bulk Fill Flowable Restorative (assumed to be made up off 100 % resins) are measured. The depth of curing of the restorative resin is equally important as the generation of heat. If the resin is not fully cured, i. e., incomplete polymerization occurs then it can adversely affect the mechanical properties, environmental resistance, wear behavior and biocompatibility with the pulpal tissue of these restorative materials. So, the knowledge of the heat generation and curing depth are essential in determining the effectiveness of a resin from the restoration point of view. To determine the two parameters; the heat generation due to polymerization of the resins and the curing depth, a detailed literature review is done on some relating topics in Chapter 1, so as to create a foundation for the thesis problem. Analysis and experiments have been conducted. The temperature rise versus time and temperature rise versus the curing depth are measured using thermal infrared techniques. Experimental results are compared to an one-dimensional heat conduction model for which the solutions is obtained using the general integral transform method. The comparison between measurement and prediction is good from the trend and shape of the plots point of view but did not agree well {{on the basis of the}} values of temperature, time and <b>specimen</b> <b>depth.</b> As the curing depth of the three resins are well beyond 5 - 6 mm (practical filling depth), so all of them could be used for the dental restorative purpose. But the results showed the heat generation due to polymerization is highest for 3 MTM ESPETM Filtek Bulk Fill Flowable Restorative and lowest for 3 M TM ESPE TM Z 100 TM Restorative. Thus this makes 3 M TM ESPE TM Z 100 TM Restorative the most suitable restorative resin out of the three for dental filling purpose...|$|E

This study assessed {{the impact of}} additional light-curing on polymerization kinetics, the degree of conversion (DC) and mechanical properties of a novel, dual-cured RBC with alkaline fillers. Since the bioactivity of a material often implies a release of compounds, the mechanical stability in simulated clinical environments was also evaluated. Polymerization kinetics and DC were assessed at 2 - and 4 -mm <b>specimen</b> <b>depths</b> in real-time up to one hour (n = 6). Incident and transmitted irradiance and radiant exposure were recorded at 2 - and 4 -mm depths. Micro-mechanical profiles (n = 6) were assessed in 100 -µm steps along 6 -mm deep specimens at 24 h post-polymerization. Flexural strength and modulus (n = 10) were determined up to three months of immersion in neutral (6. 8) and acidic (4) pH conditions. DC variation in time was best described by a sigmoidal function (R 2 > 0. 98), revealing a retarded (3. 4 ± 0. 4 min) initiation in C=C double bond conversion in self-cured versus dual-cured specimens. The setting reaction kinetic was identical at 2 - and 4 -mm depths for the self-cure mode. For the dual-cure mode, polymerization initiated at 2 -mm depth instantly with light-irradiation, while being retarded (0. 8 min) at 4 -mm depth. The material behaves similarly, irrespective of curing mode or depth, later than 11 min after mixing.
