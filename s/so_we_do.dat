McGregor called his first on-screen kiss with Brewer [...] "awkward". Mark liked Kate as she was [...] "a pretty easy-going girl who doesn't let too much get to her", but McGregor told TV Week that Mark was wary of starting a relationship with her because of Declan and his commitment to his work. He was also hesitant because of the age gap between them. McGregor told Holy Soap, [...] "Kate's 19 and my character is about 25. It's funny because a few friends of mine have mentioned it, but I think it's because of what they do and where they are in life. At one point Kate's having driving lessons, and I'm working as a detective who's moved up through the ranks quickly, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> seem quite different in age, but it's better left unsaid I think!"

500|$|The Navy didn't {{like the}} compromises made {{to reduce the}} {{displacement}} down to Stalin's [...] and to achieve the high speed demanded as revealed in a March 1950 meeting in the Kremlin where Stalin revealed critical points about his thoughts for these ships. When the admirals responded to his question about {{the purpose of these}} ships by saying that they were to fight the enemy's heavy cruisers, he contradicted them and said that their purpose was to fight light cruisers: [...] "It is necessary to increase its speed to 35 knots and create a cruiser that will cause panic among the enemy's light cruisers, disperse and destroy them." [...] Furthermore, he believed that they would fight close to home, defending the coastal waters of Soviet Union. [...] "You cannot blindly copy the Americans and English, they face different conditions, their ships travel far over the ocean, out of touch with their bases. We are not considering conducting oceanic battles, but instead will fight close to our own shores, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not need a large ammunition supply on the ship." [...] The admirals also did not like the reduction in the secondary armament made to accommodate the larger machinery and extra boilers needed to reach the speed desired by Stalin, but he reminded them that most aircraft would attack the battlecruiser at heights below [...] and the ceiling of the 130mm was far in excess of that. He also ordered a reduction in the light anti-aircraft guns believing that its escorts would defend it. This design was approved by the Council of Ministers on 25 March 1950.|$|E

500|$|During the 1999 {{parliamentary}} {{debate on the}} rule of law, Jeyaretnam asserted that detention without trial under the ISA contravened the doctrine as [...] "there {{is no way of}} checking the Minister's decision, who decides to make an order detaining a subject, depriving him of his liberty, completely contrary to the rule of natural justice and the fundamental principle that all men are free". He called for the provisions in the Act permitting such detention to be repealed, saying: [...] "The power is only necessary in emergency times when there is a real threat and <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not need it any more. Let us for once realise that it is a violation of the Rule of Law. Let us be honest and repeal it." [...] Nominated Member of Parliament Simon Tay expressed the view that [...] "the ISA fulfills the Constitution as an exception. It does not fulfill the concept of the Rule of Law in the sense that there are only very limited grounds on which a court can review the decision of the Minister. It is in that sense a subjective discretion." [...] Nonetheless, he recognized that the ISA remained relevant, for instance, as a tool against people alleged to have engaged in espionage, and thus preventive detention could not be definitively declared right or wrong: [...] "It is a case-by-case decision, because that is how we live our lives in a real society." [...] Responding to Jeyaretnam, Ho Peng Kee noted that the justifications for the ISA had been fully debated in Parliament on previous occasions, and emphasized that there are safeguards in place to tackle the apparent arbitrariness of detentions under the Act, including a review of each detention by an advisory board composed of a Supreme Court judge and two prominent members of the public, and also the President's personal discretion to order a detainee's release in the event that the advisory board and Home Affairs Minister disagreed over the necessity for the detention.|$|E

This was clearly demonstrated in 2002, when the band was booked to appear on UK national TV channel GMTV, where they were to play [...] "Don't You Want Me" [...] before being interviewed. The producer was astounded when the band arrived at 5am (three hours early) expecting {{to set up and}} rehearse; it had been assumed they would just mime to playback.

2500|$|The Tuesday {{night after}} the second double murder, rumors had already spread that the killer had been caught.

Captain Gonzaullas and Sheriff Presley discounted these allegations. Surprised at the credence locals gave them, Gonzaullas also stated that it [...] "hindered the investigation because of the time it was necessary to consume tracking it down. The spreading of the rumor certainly was an injustice to the family and the boy, because it absolutely is not <b>so.</b> <b>We</b> <b>do</b> not have any minister's son in custody at this time, nor have we had one in custody or questioned a minister's son relative to this crime." ...|$|E
2500|$|Instances of this {{behavior}} {{have been found}} in the Bible. In a cave painting from at least 8000 BC in the Northern Italian Val Camonica a man is shown about to penetrate an animal. Raymond Christinger interprets that as a show of power of a tribal chief, and <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not know if this practice was then more acceptable, and if the scene depicted was usual or unusual or whether it was symbolic or imaginary. The Cambridge Illustrated History of Prehistoric Art says the scene may be humorous, as the penetrating man seems to be waving cheerfully with his hand at the same time. Potters seem to have spent time depicting the practice, but this may be because they found the idea amusing. Dr [...] "Jacobus X", said to be a nom-de-plume for a French author, said this was clearly [...] "before any known taboos against sex with animals existed." [...] Marc Epprecht states that authors such as Jacobus X do not deserve respect because their methodology is based on hearsay, and was designed for voyeuristic titillation of the reader. Masters said that since pre-historic man is prehistoric {{it goes without saying that}} we know little of his sexual behaviour, depictions in cave paintings may only show the artist's subjective preoccupations or thoughts.|$|E

2500|$|Within the church, {{there have}} also been a number of {{unofficial}} statements regarding gender. For example, [...] "Strengthening Our Families: An In-Depth Look at the Proclamation on the Family" [...] (a book compiled by the School of Family Life at the church-owned Brigham Young University) states, [...] "Although we do not fully understand the eternal nature of gender, we should acknowledge its meaning and purpose, and humbly seek to understand and appreciate the nature of divine gender distinctions in God's plan for His children." [...] The book also states: God created us male and female. This is not a mistake or a variety of genetic or hormonal chance. What we call gender is an essential characteristic of our existence prior to our birth. Gender is part of our eternal identity and essential to our eternal progression. Although we may not know all the reasons why this is <b>so,</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> know some of the reasons why gender is essential to our eternal progression. To achieve our exaltation, an eternal marriage {{between a man and a}} woman is necessary. ...The sexual union between a married man and woman is, among other things, the means God has ordained to bring His spirit children into mortality, which is an essential step in the plan of salvation.|$|E
2500|$|The above account, however, is dated {{five years}} after Sulcoit in the Annals of Inisfallen, and {{is in fact the}} first entry {{following}} the lacuna beginning in mid 969, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not know what events have preceded it in the past two and a half years, assuming it is correctly placed. Ivar is first mentioned by name in the surviving annals in early-mid 969, which record that [...] "Beólán Litil and his son were killed by Ímar of Luimnech." [...] The identity of this person is not completely certain but he is assumed to be identical with the Uí Néill king of Lagore (Loch Gabor) or Southern Brega whose death, without cause given, is recorded in several other annals in the same year. [...] Clare Downham notes that this puts Ivar and the Limerick Norse active all the way out in the neighborhood of Dublin and says that Beolán was an ally of the King of Dublin, namely Olaf Cuaran. The Cogad also records this killing but provides no motive, simply mentioning it immediately after Ivar's return to Limerick, allegedly from Britain, with a second great fleet. After his alleged expulsion sometime following Sulcoit the author of the Cogad states Ivar and a certain [...] "Amlaíb, son of Amlaíb" [...] attempted the conquest of Britain, but without success, with Amlaib being killed by the king of Britain (unnamed). Having returned to Limerick and killed Beolán (or vice versa), Ivar is said to have then [...] "made many spoils and battles." [...] No other record of these survives, if this properly counts as one, and we must wait til 972 for the Annals of Inisfallen to pick up again.|$|E
