Experiments under high inoculum pressure showed a reduction in newly formed cankers of 57, 35 and 60 % with respect to untreated for 3 years respectively. The chemical standard thiophanate-methyl further reduced the number of newly formed cankers by 99, 60 and 89 % with respect to untreated for these 3 years respectively in these experiments.

As Jennifer Shute noted, [...] "the Trobrianders eat alone, {{retiring}} to their own hearths with their portions, turning their backs on one another and eating rapidly {{for fear of being}} observed." [...] However, it is perfectly acceptable to chew betel nuts, particularly when mixed with some pepper plant and <b>slaked</b> <b>lime</b> <b>to</b> make the nut less bitter. The betel nut acts as a stimulant and is commonly used by Trobrianders, causing their teeth to often appear red.

Miamala is the time of the year when the subject of food is most discussed and that time food is more important because it is harvest time and it is time of feasting. But they can face hunger and scarcity at any time of year because of poor growing conditions. In the mid of 2009 the problem of food insecurity was brought to attention on national and international level by the media. The stories they reported were of more concern about population pressure which results as food shortage. Australian and International media highlighted the food shortage topic.|$|R

50|$|CMA can be {{produced}} from a reaction of a magnesium/calcium compound with glacial acetic acid. If it is reacted with dolomite or dolomitic lime, acetic acid {{does not need to}} be concentrated to produce CMA. Acetic acid production requires the fermentation of organic material which must be carried out at a pH around 6.0. Separating agents used to recover acetic acid must therefore maintain a high capacity while within this pH range. Amberlite LA-2 in 1-octanol diluent maintains nearly full capacity up to a pH value of 6.0 and is readily regenerated by aqueous, <b>slaked</b> dolomitic <b>lime</b> <b>to</b> form CMA, making it a good acetic acid separating agent for CMA production.|$|R

Batch bioleaching was performed on a pyrite concentrate in 1 -L reactors, using a mixed mesophilic culture at a temperature of 35 ºC. Neutralising agents were added regularly to ad-just pH to the desired level of 1. 5. The ashes used were Bioash, Waste ash and Coal & Tyres ash, representing ashes gen-erated from combustion of biomass, a mixture of wood chips and municipal waste, and a mixture of coal and tyres. The dust used was an EAF dust produced in a scrap-based steel plant, while the sludge used was Mesalime produced in a pa-per and pulp plant. The study aimed to investigate the possibility to replace the conventionally used lime or limestone with by-products, based on their neutralising capacity and to observe eventual toxic effects on the bacterial activity. The bioleaching effi-ciency was similar for all the neutralising agents used except Waste ash, when compared with <b>slaked</b> <b>lime.</b> The extent of pyrite oxidation was in the range 69 - 75 % for all neutralising agents, except Waste ash, which had a pyrite oxidation of 59 %. The Waste ash contained {{a large number of}} potentially toxic elements and the chloride concentration of 11 % proba-bly had a negative effect as observed on the lower redox potential and pyrite oxidation.

This material is usually some kind of clay soil which is considered as impermeable and erosion-resistant. Dispite that, in many occasions not only seepage, but {{the failure of the}} dam occured due to surface erosion, because these kinds of irregular soils are barely investigated, and their presence are not considered during the phase of designing. In geotechnics these soils are called dispersive clays, and their greatest hazard is that they are not distinguishable at sight or by the standard geotechnical tests from the regular erosion-resistant clays, therfore many dams are built by these kind of materials, causing extra risk when {{it comes to}} evaluating the probability of failure.

After hydration, the slightly moist <b>slaked</b> <b>lime</b> is conveyed <b>to</b> a separator where coarse fractions are removed, and the powder dries.

The nanostructure and irreversible colloid nature of calcium hydroxide crystals in <b>slaked</b> <b>lime</b> putty, which determine the desirable working properties of putties, such as plasticity, density and viscosity, are modified through crystal coarsening triggered by drying.
