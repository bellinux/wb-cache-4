5|$|Harding's {{political}} advisers {{had given}} him a physically demanding schedule, even though the president had ordered it cut back.

5000|$|Spoking {{patterns}} may be [...] or semi-tangential. For {{a normal}} wheel size and spoke count, only {{the latter is}} suitable for a wheel that has to transmit torque from the hub to the rim, as with rear wheels or hub brakes. This rule is occasionally broken where {{a very large number}} of spokes is used or the wheel is unusually small in diameter, either of which reduces the amount of increased tensile stress <b>on</b> each radial <b>spoke</b> to an acceptable degree; some BMX bicycles and low-riders use radial spoking for both wheels. Rear wheels may also incorporate radial <b>spoking</b> <b>on</b> the non-drive side and semi-tangential <b>spoking</b> <b>on</b> the drive side. At least one example, the Mavic Ksyrium, has radial <b>spoking</b> <b>on</b> the drive side of the rear wheel.|$|R

Presley was raised in Graceland, while Jackson lived at Neverland.|$|E
5|$|Letcher was {{considered}} the strongest Whig candidate in the state, and his inability to win the seat was a harbinger of the ultimate failure of the Whig Party in Kentucky.

5|$|On February 7, 2011, the premier’s office {{announced}} {{that due to}} several incidents since Dunderdale became premier in December that police bodyguards were protecting her.

Dunderdale <b>spoke</b> <b>on</b> the issue the following day, she said that due to privacy reasons she was partially reluctant to take on a bodyguard but respects the RNC’s decision. Dunderdale also said that the police had asked her not to comment on the issue and therefore she would stay mum about what led to the need for security.|$|E
5|$|The Sauks {{were divided}} {{about whether to}} resist {{implementation}} of the disputed 1804 treaty. Most Sauks decided to relocate west of the Mississippi rather than become involved in a confrontation with the United States. The leader of this group was Keokuk, who had helped defend Saukenuk against the Americans during the War of 1812. Keokuk was not a chief, but as a skilled orator, he often <b>spoke</b> <b>on</b> behalf of the Sauk civil chiefs in negotiations with the Americans. Keokuk regarded the 1804 treaty as a fraud, but after having seen the size of American cities {{on the east coast}} in 1824, he did not think the Sauks could successfully oppose the United States.|$|E
40|$|The common {{interpretation}} of <b>spokes</b> <b>on</b> the B ring of Saturn {{is that they}} are the result of light scattered by electrostatically levitated micrometer- and submicrometer-size dust particles.

5|$|This {{incident}} {{sparked a}} major public discussion on station safety and security, mainly because the station was unstaffed when the suspects mugged Ali on the platform. The only security present was CCTV cameras, and the ticket barriers were left open allowing the suspects to enter the station freely. Many high-profile politicians <b>spoke</b> <b>on</b> the issue of station safety and called on rail companies to provide security or staff the station until the last train had left the station. The Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone assailed Silverlink, the train company who managed the station, for not providing all-night staffing or security. The new provider of every franchise across the rail network will have to provide staff at all times the station is open.|$|E
5|$|According to Carroll family tradition, Powis {{told his}} new clerk that he {{believed}} King James was receiving bad advice related to the religious turmoil in England. Powis {{was concerned about the}} consequences for English Catholics. He supposedly <b>spoke</b> <b>on</b> Carroll's behalf to an associate of his, Charles Calvert, proprietor of the Maryland colony. Charles Calvert's grandfather, George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, was a former member of Parliament and Secretary of State to James I, whose Catholicism had effectively ended his political career. Intense lobbying by George Calvert had led to the granting of a hereditary charter to the Calvert family. The Maryland colony was established in the 1630s on land granted by this charter. It was intended as a haven for English Catholics and other religious minorities. Powis may have encouraged Carroll to emigrate to Maryland with the hope that the younger man's career would come to greater fulfillment in a place with less religious conflict than England at the time.|$|E

Sherman looked forward to staying with his wife at home for an extended period {{for the first time in}} years, when news arrived that Garfield had been shot in Washington. The assassin, Charles J. Guiteau, was a deranged office-seeker who believed that Garfield's successor would appoint him to a patronage job. After lingering for several months, Garfield died, and Arthur became president. After completing a long-planned visit to Yellowstone National Park and other Western sites with his brother William, Sherman returned to a second special session of Congress in October 1881.|$|E
