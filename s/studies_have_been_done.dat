25|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} in size {{has been}} proposed as {{an explanation for the}} widespread nature of sexual cannibalism across distantly related arthropods. Typically, male birds and mammals are larger as they participate in male-male competition. However, in arthropods this size dimorphism ratio is reversed, with females commonly larger than males. Sexual cannibalism may have led to selection for larger, stronger, females in invertebrates. Further research is needed to evaluate the explanation. To date, <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> on wolf spiders such as Zyuzicosa (Lycosidae), where the female is much larger than the male.|$|E
25|$|Prenylcysteine lyase (PCLase) catalyzes the {{cleavage}} of prenylcysteine (a protein modification) {{to form an}} isoprenoid aldehyde and the freed cysteine residue on {{the protein}} target. The FAD is non-covalently bound to PCLase. Not many mechanistic <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> looking at the reactions of the flavin, but the proposed mechanism is shown below. It is proposed {{that there is a}} hydride transfer from the C1 of the prenyl moiety to FAD that results in the reduction of the flavin to FADH2 and the formation of a carbocation that is stabilized by the neighboring sulfur atom. FADH2 then reacts with molecular oxygen to restore the oxidized enzyme.|$|E
25|$|Several <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> on Palestinian textbooks. The U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem {{commissioned}} {{studies from}} IPCRI – Israel/Palestine Center for Research and Information. In Europe the Georg Eckert Institute performed research. The Hebrew University's Harry S. Truman Research Institute for the Advancement of Peace has also published papers on this issue. A U.S. Senate subcommittee and the Political Committee of the European Parliament have both held hearings about Palestinian textbooks. Israel {{has used the}} issue as a cornerstone of its Hasbara campaign against the Palestinian Authority. Palestinians say that their textbooks rightly focus on their own national narrative, which includes the privations of life under occupation.|$|E

25|$|Different {{diseases}} and disorders {{can affect the}} biological workings of semantic memory. A variety of <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> {{in an attempt to}} determine the effects on varying aspects of semantic memory. For example, Lambon, Lowe, & Rogers (2007) studied the different effects semantic dementia and herpes simplex virus encephalitis have on semantic memory. They found that semantic dementia has a more generalized semantic impairment. Additionally, deficits in semantic memory as a result of herpes simplex virus encephalitis tend to have more category-specific impairments. Other disorders that affect semantic memory - such as Alzheimer's disease - has been observed clinically as errors in naming, recognizing, or describing objects. Whereas researchers have attributed such impairment to degradation of semantic knowledge (Koenig et al. 2007).|$|E
25|$|Programs are set {{up around}} the country in hopes to educate {{individuals}} with and without developmental disabilities. <b>Studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> testing specific scenarios on how what is the most beneficial way to educate people. Interventions are a great way to educate people, but also the most time consuming. With the busy schedules that everybody has, it is found to be difficult to go about the intervention approach. Another scenario that was found to be not as beneficial, but more realistic in the time sense was Psychoeducational approach. They focus on informing people on what abuse is, how to spot abuse, and what to do when spotted. Individuals with developmental disabilities don't only need the support programs to keep them safe, but everybody in society needs to be aware of what is happening and how to help everybody prosper.|$|E
25|$|Numerous <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> on {{possible}} effect {{of nuclear power}} in causing cancer. Such studies have looked for excess cancers in both plant workers and surrounding populations due to releases during normal operations of nuclear plants {{and other parts of}} the nuclear power industry, as well as excess cancers in workers and the public due to accidental releases. There is agreement that excess cancers in both plant workers and the surrounding public have been caused by accidental releases such as the Chernobyl accident. There is also agreement that some workers in other parts of the nuclear fuel cycle, most notably uranium mining – at least in past decades – have had elevated rates of cancer. However, numerous studies of possible cancers caused by nuclear power plants in normal operation have come to opposing conclusions, and the issue is a matter of scientific controversy and ongoing study.|$|E

30|$|Two {{studies are}} more {{complete}} and more impressive {{among the various}} <b>studies</b> that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> about uniqueness of the people's blood vessels pattern [12]. In 1935, Simon and Goldstein [7] first introduced uniqueness of the pattern of vessels among peoples; they also have suggested using of retina images for identification in their subsequent articles. The next <b>study</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> by Tower in 1950 which showed that pattern of retina's blood vessels is different even for twins [16, 17].|$|R

25|$|MEG is {{also being}} used to better {{localize}} responses in the brain. The openness of the MEG setup allows external auditory and visual stimuli to be easily introduced. Some movement by the subject is also possible {{as long as it}} does not jar the subject's head. The responses in the brain before, during, and after the introduction of such stimuli/movement can then be mapped with greater spatial resolution than was previously possible with EEG. Psychologists are also taking advantage of MEG neuroimaging to better understand relationships between brain function and behavior. For example, a number of <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> comparing the MEG responses of patients with psychological troubles to control patients. There has been great success isolating unique responses in patients with schizophrenia, such as auditory gating deficits to human voices. MEG {{is also being}} used to correlate standard psychological responses, such as the emotional dependence of language comprehension.|$|E
25|$|A rise {{in social}} network use is {{being driven by}} college {{students}} using the services to network with professionals for internship and job opportunities. Many <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> {{on the effectiveness of}} networking online in a college setting, and one notable one is by Phipps Arabie and Yoram Wind published in Advances in Social Network Analysis. Many schools have implemented online alumni directories which serve as makeshift social networks that current and former students can turn to for career advice. However, these alumni directories tend to suffer from an oversupply of advice-seekers and an undersupply of advice providers. One new social networking service, Ask-a-peer, aims to solve this problem by enabling advice seekers to offer modest compensation to advisers for their time. LinkedIn is also another great resource. It helps alumni, students and unemployed individuals look for work. They are also able to connect with others professionally and network with companies.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} has established {{the existence of}} primary progressive apraxia of speech caused by neuroanatomic motor atrophy. For a long time, this disorder was not distinguished from other motor speech disorders such as dysarthria and in particular primary progressive aphasia. Many <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> trying to identify areas in the brain in which this particular disorder occurs {{or at least to}} show that it occurs in different areas of the brain than other disorders. One study observed 37 patients with neurodegenerative speech disorders {{to determine whether or not}} it is distinguishable from other disorders, and if so where in the brain it can be found. Using speech and language, neurological, neuropsychological and neuroimaging testing, the researchers came to the conclusion that PAS does exist and that it correlates to superior lateral premotor and supplementary motor atrophy. However, because PAS is such a rare and recently discovered disorder, many studies do not have enough subjects to observe to make data entirely conclusive.|$|E
