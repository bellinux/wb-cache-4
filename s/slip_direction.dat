40|$|Variations in diurnal tidal stress due to Europa's {{eccentric}} orbit {{have been considered}} as the driver of strike-slip motion along pre-existing faults, but obliquity and physical libration have not been taken into account. The first objective of this work {{is to examine the}} effects of obliquity on the predicted global pattern of fault <b>slip</b> <b>directions</b> based on a tidal-tectonic formation model. Our second objective is to test the hypothesis that incorporating obliquity can reconcile theory and observations without requiring polar wander, which was previously invoked to explain the mismatch found between the <b>slip</b> <b>directions</b> of 192 faults on Europa and the global pattern predicted using the eccentricity-only model. We compute predictions for individual, observed faults at their current latitude, longitude, and azimuth with four different tidal models: eccentricity only, eccentricity plus obliquity, eccentricity plus physical libration, and a combination of all three effects. We then determine whether longitude migration, presumably due to non-synchronous rotation, is indicated in observed faults by repeating the comparisons with and without obliquity, this time also allowing longitude translation. We find that a tidal model including an obliquity of 1. 2 ?, along with longitude migration, can predict the <b>slip</b> <b>directions</b> of all observed features in the survey. However, all but four faults can be fit with only 1 ? of obliquity so the value we find may represent the maximum departure from a lower time-averaged obliquity value. Adding physical libration to the obliquity model improves the accuracy of predictions at the current locations of the faults, but fails to predict the <b>slip</b> <b>directions</b> of six faults and requires additional degrees of freedom. The obliquity model with longitude migration is therefore our preferred model. Although the polar wander interpretation cannot be ruled out from these results alone, the obliquity model accounts for all observations with a value consistent with theoretical expectations and cycloid modeling...|$|R

50|$|In {{materials}} science, a slip system {{describes the}} set of symmetrically identical slip planes and associated family of slip directions for which dislocation motion can easily occur and lead to plastic deformation.An external force makes parts of the crystal lattice glide along each other, changing the material's geometry.Depending {{on the type of}} lattice, different slip systems are present in the material.More specifically, slip occurs on close-packed planes (those containing the greatest number of atoms per area), and in close-packed directions (most atoms per length). The magnitude and direction of slip are represented by the Burgers vector.The picture on the right shows a schematic view of the slip mechanism.The slip planes and slip directions in a crystal have specific crystallographic forms.The slip planes are normally the planes with the highest density of atoms, i.e., those most closely spaced, and the direction of the slip is the direction in the slip plane that corresponds to one of the shortest lattice translation vectors.Often, this is the direction in which atoms are most closely spaced.A slip plane and a <b>slip</b> <b>direction</b> constitute a slip system.A critical resolved shear stress is required to initiate a slip.

30|$|This {{similarity}} is also {{apparent in}} the seismicity. The earthquakes in the Urakawa-Oki and Kamaishi-Oki regions show linear distributions in the <b>slip</b> <b>direction</b> (Fig.  1 c, d). A similar observation has also been reported for the strike-slip environment of the San Andreas Fault, California, where Rubin and Gillard (2000) showed linear distributions of small repeating earthquakes. The elongate slip distributions and linear earthquake distributions are probably different manifestations of the anisotropy in the <b>slip</b> <b>direction.</b> We therefore return {{to the idea of}} a patchy structure. If several patches are sparsely distributed in the <b>slip</b> <b>direction,</b> then each patch tends to rupture independently, as observed in the Urakawa-Oki and Kamaishi-Oki regions. However, if several patches are densely distributed in the <b>slip</b> <b>direction,</b> each patch tends to rupture dynamically and continuously, following the observations in the Kushiro-Oki and Naka-Oki regions. Field observations from outcropping faults have reported that a characteristic structure develops in the <b>slip</b> <b>direction,</b> with the fault surfaces corrugated on a variety of scales and possessing lineations that are parallel to the <b>slip</b> <b>direction</b> (Power et al. 1987, 1988; Power and Tullis 1991; Kuwahara et al. 1993; Lee and Bruhn 1996; Renard et al. 2006; Candela et al. 2009; Kirkpatrick and Brodsky 2014). The patchy structure must therefore be related to these field observations.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} motion of a uniform thin rod {{released}} from rest, with the bottom end initially in contact with a horizontal surface. Our focus here is {{the motion of}} the bottom end as the rod falls. For small angles of release with respect to the horizontal, the rod falls without the bottom end slipping. For larger angles, the <b>slipping</b> <b>direction</b> depends on the static friction coefficient between the rod and the horizontal surface. Small friction coefficients cause the end to slip initially in one direction and then in the other, while for high coefficients, the end <b>slips</b> in one <b>direction</b> only.

40|$|Abstract. Recent {{advances}} {{in our understanding}} of fatigue crack growth processes and respective crack growth modeling techniques are reviewed. Much of the observed experimental behavior (such as the effects of notches, maximum applied stress, crack length, in-plane biaxiality, out-of-plane constraint, and transient loadings) can be explained based on crack closure concepts. Both Dugdale based models and finite element techniques have been utilized. However, so far neither approach has accounted for crystallographic slip effects, grain orientation effects, or microstructural barriers. A model for crack closure with two microscopic crystallographic <b>slip</b> <b>directions</b> is used to model microscopic cracks. The model predicts variations in closure levels as the orientations of the two <b>slip</b> <b>directions,</b> with respect to the crack growth direction, are changed.

30|$|Our {{results suggest}} either some linear {{structure}} that extends in the <b>slip</b> <b>direction</b> or the long-term motion along the plate boundary. Almost all the M[*]> 4 earthquakes in the Naka-Oki and Kushiro-Oki regions possess a slip distribution that is elongate in the <b>slip</b> <b>direction.</b> However, the heterogeneous azimuthal station distribution, {{with most of}} the stations {{to one side of the}} events, may suggest that this elongation is an artifact. The 1 -σ model error is estimated to be three times smaller than the estimated value (Additional file 1 : Figures S 16 and S 17), which indicates that the slip anisotropy of these earthquakes is not an artifact. Furthermore, the total slip distribution of the M[*]~[*] 3 earthquakes in each region is estimated as an approximate point source without any elongation (Figs.  6 e, 8 g). Moreover, the elongation direction is in parallel to the <b>slip</b> <b>direction,</b> rather than the dip direction, which is more likely to appear as the result of inhomogeneous station distribution. The station distributions are quite different between the Kushiro-Oki and Naka-Oki regions. Therefore, it is unlikely that the modeled elongation is an artifact due to this heterogeneous station distribution. We propose that this elongate slip distribution that is parallel to the <b>slip</b> <b>direction</b> is a common feature of earthquakes in the Tohoku–Hokkaido subduction zone. This interpretation is supported by the slip distributions of larger earthquakes, such as the 2003 Tokachi-Oki (Mw 8.3) and 2005 Miyagi-Oki (Mw 7.2) earthquakes, which were also elongate in the <b>slip</b> <b>direction</b> (Koketsu et al. 2004; Yaginuma et al. 2007; Wu et al. 2008).|$|E

In this study, we adopt the approach of Otsubo et al. (2008, 2013) for the analysis of stress and associated focal mechanisms in the Iwaki City region. The spatial and temporal changes in stress can be identified by relating observed slip directions from focal mechanisms to a single stress solution (Otsubo et al. 2008, 2013). The threshold of the misfit angle was determined here based on the uncertainties of the strike, dip, and rake (Gephart and Forsyth 1984; Michael 1991). When the misfit angles are smaller than the uncertainties of the stress and focal mechanism solutions, the observed slip directions agree with theoretical values to within the estimated uncertainties.|$|E

The minimum energy path between two potential minima, and thus the corresponding activation barrier, is obtained using the Nudged Elastic Band method. The constructed Peierls barrier reproduces correctly both the well-known twinning-antitwinning asymmetry observed for pure shear parallel to the <b>slip</b> <b>direction</b> and the effect of shear stresses perpendicular to the <b>slip</b> <b>direction.</b> This advancement introduces {{for the first time the}} effect of both shear stresses parallel and perpendicular to the <b>slip</b> <b>direction</b> into the model of thermally activated dislocation motion.
