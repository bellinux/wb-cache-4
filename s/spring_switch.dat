50|$|On {{the morning}} of the derailment, Norfolk Southern train 703 {{approached}} the <b>spring</b> <b>switch</b> at the west end of the Boyd Siding and was given a signal restriction. The crew of 703 stopped in the siding and examined the <b>spring</b> <b>switch</b> at the east end of the siding, noting a 1/4-inch gap was present between the switch point and the stock rail. The crew manually operated the switch several times and noted that the switch still had a small 1/8-inch gap. The 703 engineer radioed Norfolk Southern dispatch to report the issue. Train 703 then proceeded through the switch without incident.|$|E
5000|$|A {{maintenance}} {{person was}} sent to investigate the report, arriving at the site around 11:00 AM EDT. He observed that the signals were clear and that the <b>spring</b> <b>switch</b> appeared to be properly aligned against the rail, likely having completely closed after train 703 passed through the switch earlier. The signal maintainer later told investigators that he felt the switch [...] "looked like it {{could use a little}} oil".|$|E

50|$|In a trailing-point {{movement}} (running {{through the}} switch {{in the wrong}} direction while they are set to turn off the track), the flanges on the wheels will force the points to the proper position. This is sometimes known as running through the switch. Some switches are designed to be forced to the proper position without damage. Examples include variable <b>switches,</b> <b>spring</b> <b>switches,</b> and weighted switches.|$|R

5000|$|Once four {{cars were}} loaded, {{they were once}} again allowed to roll {{downhill}} to a special section of track called the [...] "Reverser Track". As the cars rolled onto the Reverser Track, they would immediately start rolling uphill until {{they came to a}} stop and started rolling back the way they came. They would then pass over a special switch, called a <b>spring</b> <b>switch,</b> that would send the four loaded cars to one of two [...] "saucer" [...] tracks. These tracks were built in a shape of a saucer, with each end higher than middle. The cars would roll into the saucer track and settle at the bottom. When the next four loaded cars arrived, they would couple to the cars already there without damaging the cars and the entire line of cars would be evenly settled on the saucer track.|$|E

By describing the multibody system with <b>springs</b> <b>switching</b> on and off in a variational inequality setting, the solutions are smooth and the behaviour in the stiff limit can be analyzed.

40|$|Correlated {{phases of}} matter provide {{long-term}} stability for systems {{as diverse as}} solids, magnets, and potential exotic quantum materials. Mechanical systems, such as relays and buckling transition <b>spring</b> <b>switches</b> can yield similar stability by exploiting non-equilibrium phase transitions. Curiously, in the optical domain, observations of such phase transitions remain elusive. However, efforts to integrate optical and mechanical systems [...] optomechanics [...] suggest that a hybrid approach combining the quantum control of optical systems with the engineerability of mechanical systems may provide {{a new avenue for}} such explorations. Here we report the first observation of the buckling of an optomechanical system, in which transitions between stable mechanical states corresponding to both first- and second-order phase transitions are driven by varying laser power and detuning. Our results enable new applications in photonics and, given rapid progress in pushing optomechanical systems into the quantum regime, the potential for explorations of quantum phase transitions.

40|$|The diet of the mulgara, Dasycercus cristicauda, {{from the}} Simpson Desert in Queensland, was {{analysed}} using seats collected between 1990 and 1995. Insects, arachnids and rodents {{were the main}} classes of prey of D. cristicauda, but reptiles, centipedes and small marsupials were also consumed. Insects represented 92 % by percentage frequency of occurrence in seats, while rodents represented 33 % by percentage frequency. Invertebrate prey {{greater than or equal}} to 6 mm in length and vertebrate prey occurred frequently in seats, but small prey (1 - 5 mm), when present, occurred in large numbers. D. cristicauda ate more individual prey items in spring and winter than in autumn, and more large-sized prey in spring than in autumn. In autumn, D. cristicauda consumed mostly insects (100 % by frequency) and few rodents (8 %), but in winter and <b>spring,</b> <b>switched</b> to rodents (38 % and 47 % respectively) and insects (88 % and 93 % respectively). Seasonal shifts in diet may reflect changes in the availability of different groups of prey, or changes in prey selectivity by D. cristicauda in response to costs imposed by seasonal reproduction. The dietary flexibility of D. cristicauda may allow individuals to occupy stable ranges, and has perhaps also promoted the persistence of the species in arid areas that have been subjected to changes in land use since European settlement...|$|R

40|$|Nutrient loading by {{riverine}} input into estuarine systems {{has increased by}} 6 â 50 times for the N load from pristine conditions to present, whereas a 18 â 180 times increase has been observed in the P load. Reductions in the ratio of N to P delivery has also occurred with time. In a review of nutrient limitation in estuarine systems, it is shown that many estuarine systems display P limitation in the <b>spring,</b> <b>switching</b> to N limitation in the summer with some estuaries displaying dissolved silicate limitation of the spring diatom bloom. Historical and recent changes in nutrient loading and their effect on nutrient limitation have intensified {{the debate on the}} control of nutrient delivery to estuaries from both agricultural and point sources, and as to what nutrient (N or P) should be managed for in estuarine systems. It is hypothesized that potential reductions in P may help oxygen depletion especially in deep estuaries and reduce fast growing macrophytes such as Ulva sp., although P reductions probably will have little effect on summer chlorophyll concentrations, an important recreational management goal. Reductions in N loading should reduce summer chlorophyll concentrations and improve the conditions for submerged aquatic vegetation and thus improve ecosystem functioning. Finally, if only P reductions are pursued, that is if we are able to reduce P such that it is limiting year around in estuarine systems, {{it is likely that the}} export of N from estuarine systems would increase to the bordering N-limited marine systems, thus only exporting the problem of enhanced production with eutrophication...|$|R

40|$|AbstractâThis paper {{reports on}} the design, fabrication, and testing of a low-actuation voltage Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) switch for {{high-frequency}} applications. The mechanical design of low spring-constant folded-suspension beams is presented first, and switches using these beams are demonstrated with measured actuation voltages of as low as 6 V. Furthermore, common nonidealities such as residual in-plane and gradient stress, as well as down-state stiction problems are addressed, and possible solutions are discussed. Finally, both experimental and theoretical data for the dynamic behavior of these devices are presented.

40|$|On {{its most}} obvious level, Ode 1. 4 by Quintus Horatius Flaccus {{consists}} of two jarringly discrepant and seemingly unrelated parts, beginning with an idyllic depiction of <b>spring</b> and <b>switching</b> to a morbid obsession with the shortness of life, which results in the "carpe diem" philosophy. On closer inspection, however, the first part encompasses not only spring but a whole cycle of seasons, gliding from very early spring (or late winter) to an almost summerlike period. In the second part, this passage of time {{is used as a}} parallel for the cycle of life, with the spring and summer as symbolic of youth and winter as emblematic of death. The combination of the two parts thus stems from a well-considered purpose rather than random association. However, the full impact of the work is only understood when it is read as a whole, composed of many parts influencing each other, since a Horatian poem is subtly held together by a careful choice of words and their positions, which form links,. reflections and contrasts. In particular this ode shows a technique of oblique and highly economical mode of expression, so that the intent of many nuances easily escapes notice...|$|R
