50|$|In a {{solid-state}} transistor, {{the electrons}} collide with the <b>semiconductor</b> <b>lattice</b> and suffer from scattering which slows down {{the speed of}} the electrons. In fact, in silicon, the velocity of electrons is limited to 1.4×107 cm/s. However, in vacuum electrons do not suffer from scattering and can reach a velocity of the velocity of up to 3×1010 cm/s. Therefore, a vacuum-channel transistor can operate at a faster speed than a silicon soild-state transistor.|$|E
50|$|A {{subsurface}} Zener diode, {{also called}} 'buried Zener', is a device {{similar to the}} Surface Zener, but with the avalanche region located deeper in the structure, typically several micrometers below the oxide. The hot carriers then lose energy by collisions with the <b>semiconductor</b> <b>lattice</b> before reaching the oxide layer and cannot be trapped there. The Zener walkout phenomenon therefore does not occur here, and the buried Zeners have voltage constant over their entire lifetime. Most buried Zeners have breakdown voltage of 5-7 volts. Several different junction structures are used.|$|E

50|$|Group III-V semiconductors, the {{compound}} semiconductors, use group VI atoms as donors and group II atoms as acceptors. Group III-V semiconductors {{can also use}} group IV atoms as either donors or acceptors. When a group IV atom replaces the group III element in the <b>semiconductor</b> <b>lattice,</b> the group IV atom acts as a donor. Conversely, when a group IV atom replaces the group V element, the group IV atom acts as an acceptor. Group IV atoms can act as both donors and acceptors; therefore, they are known as amphoteric impurities.|$|E
5000|$|Neutron effects: A neutron {{interacting}} with the <b>semiconductor</b> <b>lattice</b> will displace its atoms. This leads {{to an increase in}} the count of recombination centers and deep-level defects, reducing the lifetime of minority carriers, thus affecting bipolar devices more than CMOS ones. Bipolar devices on silicon tend to show changes in electrical parameters at levels of 1010 to 1011 neutrons/cm², CMOS devices aren't affected until 1015 neutrons/cm². The sensitivity of the devices may increase together with increasing level of integration and decreasing size of individual structures. There is also a risk of induced radioactivity caused by neutron activation, which is a major source of noise in high energy astrophysics instruments. Induced radiation, together with residual radiation from impurities in used materials, can cause all sorts of single-event problems during the device's lifetime. GaAs LEDs, common in optocouplers, are very sensitive to neutrons. The lattice damage influences the frequency of crystal oscillators. Kinetic energy effects (namely lattice displacement) of charged particles belong here too.|$|E
5000|$|Total {{ionizing}} dose effects: The {{cumulative damage}} of the <b>semiconductor</b> <b>lattice</b> (lattice displacement damage) caused by ionizing radiation over the exposition time. It {{is measured in}} rads and causes slow gradual degradation of the device's performance. A total dose greater than 5000 rads delivered to silicon-based devices in seconds to minutes will cause long-term degradation. In CMOS devices, the radiation creates electron-hole pairs in the gate insulation layers, which cause photocurrents during their recombination, and the holes trapped in the lattice defects in the insulator create a persistent gate biasing and influence the transistors' threshold voltage, making the N-type MOSFET transistors easier and the P-type ones more difficult to switch on. The accumulated charge can be high {{enough to keep the}} transistors permanently open (or closed), leading to device failure. Some self-healing takes place over time, but this effect is not too significant. This effect is the same as hot carrier degradation in high-integration high-speed electronics. Crystal oscillators are somewhat sensitive to radiation doses, which alter their frequency. The sensitivity can be greatly reduced by using swept quartz. Natural quartz crystals are especially sensitive. Radiation performance curves for TID testing may be generated for all resultant effects testing procedures. These curves show performance trends throughout the TID test process and are included in the radiation test report.|$|E

50|$|This MLD {{technique}} utilizes the crystalline {{nature of}} semiconductors and its self-limiting surface reaction properties to form highly uniform, self-assembled, covalently bonded dopant-containing monolayers {{followed by a}} subsequent annealing step for the incorporation and diffusion of dopants. The monolayer formation reaction is self-limiting, thereby, resulting in the deterministic coverage of dopant atoms on the surface. MLD differs from other conventional doping techniques such as spin-on-dopants (SODs) and gas phase doping techniques {{in the way of}} dopant dose control. Such control in MLD is much more precise due to the self-limiting formation of covalently attached dopants on the surface while the SODs just rely on the thickness control of the spin-on oxide and the gas phase technique depends on the control of dopant gas flow rate; therefore, the excellent dose control in MLD can yield the exact tuning of the resulting dopant profile. Compared to ion-implantation, MLD does not involve the energetic introduction of dopant species into the <b>semiconductor</b> <b>lattice</b> where crystal damages are induced. In the case of implantation, defects such as interstitials and vacancies are inevitably generated, which interact with the dopants to further broaden the junction profile. This is known as the transient-enhanced diffusion (TED), which limits the formation of good quality of USJs. Also, stochastic variation in the dopant positioning and sever stoichiometric imbalance are thus induced for binary and tertiary compound semiconductors by the implantation techniques. In contrast, all MLD dopant atoms are thermally diffused from the crystal surface to the bulk and the dopant profile can be easily controlled by the thermal budget. Since the MLD system can be classified as a limited source model, this is desirable for controlled USJ fabrication with high uniformity and low stochastic variation. Combined with the excellent dopant dose uniformity and coverage in MLD, it is especially attractive for doping nonplanar devices such as fin-FETs and nanowires. As a result, high quality sub-5 nm ultra-shallow junction has been demonstrated in silicon via the use of this MLD technique. Compared to low-energy ion-implantation into a screening film followed by in-diffusion, the MLD technique requires a lower thermal budget and allows conformal doping on topographic features.|$|E

However, displacement damage causes new defects in the <b>semiconductor</b> <b>lattice</b> of the active area, significantly affecting the DCR; e.g., in Ref. [15] DCR of APD irradiated by protons increased by one to two orders of magnitude (limited by a saturated passive quenching window comparator).|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, the {{interest}} in reducing the lattice thermal conductivity (kL), without affecting the electrical one (ke), {{represents one of the}} main objectives for researchers in thermoelectricity. In <b>semiconductors,</b> <b>lattice</b> vibrations contribute about 95 % to thermal conductivity. Because phonons and electrons transport operates over markedly different length scales, the power factor (S 2 r), and consequently the ZT factor of merit, can be significantly improved through the reduction of kL without sacrifying the electrical conductivity (r) and the Seebeck coefficient (S). In this work, we focus on the realization of an efficient e-beam lithography patterning methodology for phononic crystals to investigate thermal conductivity reduction in novel integrated thin film converters. The adopted ''dots on the fly'' lithography strategy, combined with an appropriate anisotropic plasma etching technique, permits the fabrication of phononic crystal patterns with minimal dimensions, easy layout and writing speeds 3 orders of magnitude larger of those obtained by conventional techniques. 2014 Elsevier B.
