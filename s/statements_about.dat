5|$|According to Jainism, no single, {{specific}} statement {{can describe}} {{the nature of}} existence and the absolute truth. This knowledge (Kevala Jnana), it adds, is comprehended only by the Arihants. Other beings and their <b>statements</b> <b>about</b> absolute truth are incomplete, and at best a partial truth. Anekāntavāda is a fundamental doctrine of Jainism.|$|E
5|$|Another {{application}} of such chain conditions is in Noetherian induction—also known as well-founded induction—which is a generalization of mathematical induction. It frequently {{is used to}} reduce general <b>statements</b> <b>about</b> collections of objects to <b>statements</b> <b>about</b> specific objects in that collection. Suppose that S is a partially ordered set. One way of proving a statement about the objects of S is to assume {{the existence of a}} counterexample and deduce a contradiction, thereby proving the contrapositive of the original statement. The basic premise of Noetherian induction is that every non-empty subset of S contains a minimal element. In particular, the set of all counterexamples contains a minimal element, the minimal counterexample. In order to prove the original statement, therefore, it suffices to prove something seemingly much weaker: For any counterexample, there is a smaller counterexample.|$|E
50|$|Essentially, {{the second}} axiom says that any <b>statement</b> <b>about</b> {{possibility}} called X {{is the same}} as a negation or denial of a different <b>statement</b> <b>about</b> necessity Y. The <b>statement</b> <b>about</b> necessity shows the denial of the same original statement X.|$|R
50|$|One can deduce this <b>statement</b> <b>about</b> linear functionals {{from the}} <b>statement</b> <b>about</b> {{positive}} linear functionals by first showing that a bounded linear functional {{can be written}} as a finite linear combination of positive ones.|$|R
50|$|This fallacy {{is often}} {{confused}} with the fallacy of hasty generalization, in which an unwarranted inference is made from a <b>statement</b> <b>about</b> a sample to a <b>statement</b> <b>about</b> the population from which it is drawn.|$|R
5|$|Both the McCain and Obama campaigns {{released}} light-hearted <b>statements</b> <b>about</b> the prank. However, a McCain campaign advisor {{said that}} behind the scenes, aides and advisors {{to the campaign}} were not happy that the pranksters were able to lie their way up to Palin, or with the publicity Palin received because of the call.|$|E
5|$|Detectives who {{had spoken}} to both Green and Farrar {{the night of the}} fire testified as to Green's unusual {{demeanor}} during their interview, and a videotape of the questioning was played, including Green's <b>statements</b> <b>about</b> having urged Tim Farrar to stay in the burning house and her references to her children in the past tense.|$|E
5|$|False {{statements}}. Offenders {{who make}} or publish false statements of fact regarding the personal character or conduct of a candidate, or false <b>statements</b> <b>about</b> a candidate's {{withdrawal from the}} election, are liable on conviction to a fine or jail of up to 12 months or both, and to the disqualifications referred to above.|$|E
5000|$|However, in IEEE arithmetic, {{division}} of zero by zero {{is still considered}} indeterminate.

5000|$|In philosophy, in re means [...] "in reality", a <b>statement</b> <b>about</b> {{the real}} world {{as opposed to a}} <b>statement</b> <b>about</b> an ideal world - Plato's idea of philosopher kings, for example, has been criticized for being {{impossible}} to maintain in re.|$|R
50|$|A {{predictive}} {{conditional sentence}} concerns a situation {{dependent on a}} hypothetical (but entirely possible) future event. The consequence is normally also a <b>statement</b> <b>about</b> the future, although {{it may also be}} a consequent <b>statement</b> <b>about</b> present or past time (or a question or order).|$|R
5|$|In 1936, Ayer wrote Language, Truth and Logic, {{in which}} he claimed that {{religious}} language is meaningless. He put forward a strong empirical position, arguing that all knowledge must either come from observations of the world or be necessarily true, like mathematical statements. In doing so, he rejected metaphysics, which considers {{the reality of a}} world beyond the natural world and science. Because it is based on metaphysics and is therefore unverifiable, Ayer denounced religious language, as well as <b>statements</b> <b>about</b> ethics or aesthetics, as meaningless. Ayer challenged the meaningfulness of all <b>statements</b> <b>about</b> God– theistic, atheistic and agnostic– arguing that they are all equally meaningless because they all discuss the existence of a metaphysical, unverifiable being.|$|E
5|$|It {{should include}} <b>statements</b> <b>about</b> {{appropriate}} attributes either to describe (define) the taxon or to differentiate it from other taxa (the diagnosis, ICZN Code, Article 13.1.1, ICN, Article 38). Both codes deliberately separate defining {{the content of}} a taxon (its circumscription) from defining its name.|$|E
5|$|More {{sophisticated}} counting techniques, {{for example}} counting cosets, yield more precise <b>statements</b> <b>about</b> finite groups: Lagrange's Theorem states {{that for a}} finite group G the order of any finite subgroup H divides the order of G. The Sylow theorems give a partial converse.|$|E

5|$|Although Benchley {{was known}} for {{misleading}} and fictional autobiographical <b>statements</b> <b>about</b> himself (at one point asserting that he wrote A Tale of Two Cities before being buried at Westminster Abbey), he actually was the great-grandchild of the founder of Benchley, Texas, Henry Wetherby Benchley, who was jailed for his help with the Underground Railroad. Robert Benchley was born on September 15, 1889, in Worcester, Massachusetts, the son of Maria Jane (Moran) and Charles Henry Benchley.|$|E
5|$|Dewi Zephaniah Phillips defended Wittgenstein's theory {{by arguing}} that {{although}} religious language games are autonomous, {{they should not be}} treated as isolated because they make <b>statements</b> <b>about</b> secular events such as birth and death. Phillips argued that because of this connection, religions can still be criticised based on human experiences of these secular events. He maintained that religion cannot be denounced as wrong because it is not empirical.|$|E
5|$|Nash {{had also}} {{previously}} made <b>statements</b> <b>about</b> {{his intention to}} bring Major League Soccer to Vancouver as early as 2011, which he has succeeded in doing. He joined the USL-1 Vancouver Whitecaps FC team's ownership group in July 2008 and in March 2009, Vancouver was officially named as a future MLS expansion city, set to join the league in 2011. Nash occasionally attends practice for his co-owned team, also called Vancouver Whitecaps FC.|$|E

5|$|News of Chatwin's AIDS {{diagnosis}} first {{surfaced in}} September 1988. However, {{at the time}} of his death, obituaries referred to Chatwin's <b>statements</b> <b>about</b> a rare fungal infection. Following his death, members of the gay community criticised Chatwin for lacking the courage to reveal the true nature of his illness, which some people think would have raised public awareness of AIDS, as he was one of the first high-profile individuals in Great Britain known to have contracted HIV.|$|E
5|$|On 31 May, {{just after}} the King of Bahrain had called for {{dialogue}} without preconditions to begin in early July the military National Safety Court issued an order for Rajab's arrest {{along with those of}} prominent Al Wefaq parliamentarians. Rajab was accused of spreading false news and <b>statements</b> <b>about</b> the situation in Bahrain and promoting hatred and disrespect of a specific religious sect, in addition to humiliating the king of Bahrain. All the detainees were released the same day.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{to these}} {{developments}} in psychology, a philosophical behaviorism (sometimes called logical behaviorism) was developed. This {{is characterized by}} a strong verificationism, which generally considers unverifiable <b>statements</b> <b>about</b> interior mental life pointless. For the behaviorist, mental states are not interior states on which one can make introspective reports. They are just descriptions of behavior or dispositions to behave in certain ways, made by third parties to explain and predict another's behavior.|$|E

5|$|The {{book has}} been called engagingly written, wisely researched, and {{honestly}} told. Critics admired the wit and humour. The book reviewer for The Globe and Mail admitted he grew impatient with the grand and repetitive <b>statements</b> <b>about</b> the changing global food system and the authors' hyperbole regarding their modest culinary discoveries. Compared to Kingsolver's Animal, Vegetable, Miracle, The 100-Mile Diet {{was found to be}} more compelling and easier to read, with Smith and MacKinnon more relatable and sympathetic than Kingsolver.|$|E
5|$|The main {{criticism}} levelled at the EIHL is {{that the}} league is too expensive, an accusation given credence {{by the collapse of}} the London Racers mid season in 2005, and the continued financial problems experienced by a number of other member clubs (most notably Basingstoke Bison and Manchester Phoenix in 2008–09). Both the Edinburgh Capitals and Newcastle Vipers made public <b>statements</b> <b>about</b> their potentially perilous financial situations, casting further doubt over both their own, and the league's sustained viability.|$|E
