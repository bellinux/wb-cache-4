5|$|His {{body was}} flown to the Casa Rosada {{for a state}} funeral, and three {{national}} days of mourning were declared. Kirchner's funeral was attended by thousands, despite heavy rain. According to media reports, 1,000 people per hour entered the Casa Rosada in groups of 100 to 150. Cristina Kirchner, dressed in mourning, <b>stood</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the coffin. People brought candles, flags and flowers, some of which Cristina accepted personally.|$|E
5|$|Production of {{electricity}} in the station ceased in 1919, ushered in by the completion of an extension to generating equipment at Newburn Steelworks. The building was retained and continued {{to be used to}} supply power to the tram route by housing a sub-station, which used rotary converters. The station also provided a service for local residents who wanted their wireless accumulators recharged. The station continued to operate in this way until 1946, when the tram route was closed. The station's chimney was demolished in 1949, along with remaining structures of the Tyne Iron Works, which had <b>stood</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the power station throughout its operation.|$|E

5|$|New York Police linked rapper Fabolous to {{a crew of}} robbers who {{targeted}} Judah twice. According {{to police}} reports, the Street Fam Crew, the gang that attempted to rob Judah, {{is made up of}} 20members, all former drug dealers from Fabolous' Brooklyn neighborhood. In 2006, three men tried to rob Judah as he <b>stood</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> his Lamborghini on West 27th Street at 10th Avenue in New York City. The three men drove up to Judah in a minivan at about 5am, and came out. One man pulled a handgun on Judah, and told him to put his jewelry on the hood of his car, but Judah ran instead. The muggers followed in their minivan, but crashed into a tree a block away. All three robbers fled the scene, but one was captured by a Homeland Security agent on his way to work, and another was grabbed by a nearby cab driver.|$|E
5|$|The first White House Astronomy Night {{was held}} on the South Lawn on October 7, 2009. This first event coincided with the International Year of Astronomy. Science Advisor to the President John Holdren <b>stood</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> President Obama as the {{president}} made a speech wherein he emphasized the values of science education and how crucial it was to society to increase the interest of youth towards studying science. This was an attempt by the White House to increase motivation for children to enter science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Only optical telescopes were used to peer at the heavens during the events. Over twenty such telescopes were placed on the South Lawn of the White House in addition to displays of Moon rocks, meteorites, and presentations of the Solar System.|$|E

According to an expert who analyzed the tree, the fall was likely due to rot.|$|E

25|$|After Cyrus's {{victory against}} Astyages, the Medes were {{subjected}} to their close kin, the Persians. In the new empire they retained a prominent position; in honour and war, they <b>stood</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the Persians; their court ceremony {{was adopted by the}} new sovereigns, who in the summer months resided in Ecbatana; and many noble Medes were employed as officials, satraps and generals.|$|E
25|$|Birger {{initially}} {{based his}} operation in Harrisburg, Southern Illinois. The law authorities in Saline County eventually {{persuaded him to}} leave, and he built a fortified speakeasy called Shady Rest just across the line in Williamson County. Shady Rest <b>stood</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> old Highway 13, halfway between Harrisburg and Marion. A small barbecue stand just off the highway served as the guard shack.|$|E

It <b>stood</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the Circus Theatre (rebuilt in 1860 as the Mariinsky Theatre), but it was {{replaced}} in the 1890s by the present-day building of the St. Petersburg Conservatory. It was at St. Petersburg's Bolshoi that the first great Russian operas, Glinka's A Life for the Tsar and Ruslan and Lyudmila, premiered.|$|E

Mrs Girvan kept goats in stone-built goat rees or pens on the good grazing near Garry Loch. The feral billy goats were wont to interfere with these nanny goats and this was another reason for their demise.|$|E
25|$|During the war Bevin was {{responsible}} for diverting nearly 48,000 military conscripts {{to work in the}} coal industry (these workers became known as the Bevin Boys) while using his position to secure significant improvements in wages and working conditions for working-class people. He also drew up the demobilisation scheme that ultimately returned millions of military personnel and civilian war workers into the peacetime economy. Bevin remained Minister of Labour until 1945 when Labour left the Coalition government. On VE Day he <b>stood</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Churchill looking down on the crowd on Whitehall.|$|E
25|$|William Wells Brown, {{who escaped}} to freedom, {{reported}} that on one plantation, slave men {{were required to}} pick 80 pounds per day of cotton, while women were required to pick 70 pounds; if any slave failed {{in his or her}} quota, they were subject to whip lashes for each pound they were short. The whipping post <b>stood</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the cotton scales. A New York man who attended a slave auction in the mid-19th century reported that at least three-quarters of the male slaves he saw at sale had scars on their backs from whipping. By contrast, small slave-owning families had closer relationships between the owners and slaves; this sometimes resulted in a more humane environment but was not a given.|$|E

25|$|Remarkably, {{this is one}} of {{very few}} {{instances}} in Egyptian art where the statues of the king and his consort have equal size. Traditionally, the statues of the queens <b>stood</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> those of the pharaoh, but were never taller than his knees. Ramesses went to Abu Simbel with his wife in the 24th year of his reign. As the Great Temple of the king, there are small statues of princes and princesses next to their parents. In this case they are positioned symmetrically: on the south side (at left as one faces the gateway) are, from left to right, princes Meryatum and Meryre, princesses Meritamen and Henuttawy, and princes Rahirwenemef and Amun-her-khepeshef, while on the north side the same figures are in reverse order. The plan of the Small Temple is a simplified version of that of the Great Temple.|$|E
25|$|The beach front {{promenade}} {{remains a}} popular draw for visitors and tourists with its Victorian Italian Garden that displays many unusual {{palm trees and}} exotic plants. The surviving element of the original Victorian pier is a summer staging point for the various pleasure steamers, that ply their trade {{from time to time}} in the Bristol Channel and the pier is used as a popular winter sea fishing venue. There is also the historic Penarth Yacht Club, built in 1883, <b>stood</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the new RNLI lifeboat station and its associated shop, together with a wide range of popular cafes and restaurants available on the seafront. The seafront remains uncommercialised with none of the amusement arcades that can be found at other traditional Victorian holiday resort frontages. The town's swimming pool and baths built in the late 19th century was closed in the 1980s and, after a short reincarnation as a bar and bistro, has recently been tastefully converted into luxury flats while retaining its Victorian exterior.|$|E
500|$|Historically, Roman stationes or auditoria, where {{teaching}} was done, <b>stood</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> public libraries housed in temples.

In the 5th century, Zacharias Rhetor reported that the school <b>stood</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the [...] "Temple of God", the description of which permitted its identification with the Byzantine Anastasis cathedral.|$|E

500|$|The only gate whose {{location}} is known with certainty, {{aside from the}} Old Golden Gate, is the Gate of Saint Aemilianus ( [...] , Porta tou hagiou Aimilianou), named in Turkish DavutpaÅa KapÄ±sÄ±. It lay at the juncture with the sea walls, and served the communication with the coast. According to the Chronicon Paschale, the Church of St Mary of Rhabdos, where the rod of Moses was kept, <b>stood</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the gate.|$|E
