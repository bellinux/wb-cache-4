In the case in which there is alteration of the <b>spermiogram</b> the microsurgical treatment seems more efficient for the sperm quality because it is more valuable in eliminating the venous stasis, and the operation Belgrano 1 seems to be the best compared to the others. Correlating the treatment efficiency to the simplicity of the application and to the treatment expense and reduced morbility we think it is advisable to treat the spermatic vein with laparoscopic ligature in patients with normal fertility indexes, even on the basis of our recent experience.

Insulation {{was applied to the}} scrotum of eight bulls (insulated) for a period of four days, eight bulls were treated daily for seven days with 20 mg dexamethasone injected intramuscularly, and four bulls were untreated controls. Semen from four bulls in each group was collected and evaluated over a six-week period after treatment. Blood samples for testosterone analysis were taken hourly for eight hours at {{the beginning and the end}} of the six-week period from the control bulls and before and after treatment from the four insulated and four dexamethasone-treated bulls that were not used for semen collection. At the end of the last blood sampling period, the four bulls in each group were castrated for the collection of testicular tissue for the determination of testosterone concentrations. Basal, peak episodic, and mean serum testosterone concentrations among control bulls, pre and postinsulated bulls, and pretreatment samples of dexamethasone-treated bulls were not different (p > 0. 05); however, bulls that had received dexamethasone treatments had significantly lower basal, peak episodic, and mean testosterone concentrations (p 0. 13). The <b>spermiograms</b> of the control bulls varied insignificantly over the six-week sampling period; however, there was a marked increase in sperm defects in insulated and dexamethasone-treated bulls. The types of sperm defects and the temporal relationships of rises and declines of sperm defects were quite similar for both treatments.

However, these results have been debated by other studies. To verify these data, we analyzed 625 individuals in three groups of case-controls from three different Italian regions. In these series, the frequency of the different genotypes was not statistically different in oligozoospermic vs normal subjects. Even considering the pooled controls and patients (348 and 277, respectively), no significant difference was shown (p = 0. 11).

40|$|We have {{observed}} that sperm quality parameters indicative of spermatozoa hyperactivation such are lower "linearity" and "straightness", and as showed by this research "elongation", were more pronounced in patients with normal <b>spermiogram</b> compared {{to the group of}} men with reduced sperm motility who were undergoing routine in vitro fertilisation. The research encompassed 97 men diagnosed with normozoospermia (n = 20), asthenozoospermia (n = 54) and oligoasthenozoospermia (n = 23). The findings indicate that sperm quality of patients with normal <b>spermiogram</b> diagnosed according to WHO criteria, may be compromised by showing premature spontaneous hyperactivation which can decrease the chances of natural conception. We assessed synergistic effects of multiple chemical elements in ejaculated semen to find if premature spontaneous hyperactivation of spermatozoa can be a sign of imbalanced semen composition especially of elements K, Ca, Cu and Zn. Human semen samples showing low or high baseline status of chemical elements concentrations were found in samples from all three diagnostic groups. However, correlation of K/Ca and Cu/Zn ratios, taking into account samples from all three groups of men, were negative at statistical significance level p = 0. 01. We tested if the negative correlation between K/Ca and Cu/Zn ratio works for greater number of semen samples. We found the negative correlation to be valid for 175 semen samples at statistical significance of p = 0. 00002. The ratio of K/Ca and Cu/Zn, i. e. increased concentrations of K and Zn in comparison to concentrations of Ca and Cu, were associated with a decrease of "straightness" in the group of men with normal <b>spermiogram</b> and pronounced spontaneous hyperactivation of spermatozoa, implying that these elements act in synergy and that the balance of elements and not their absolute concentrations plays the major role in premature spermatozoa hyperactivation in ejaculated semen...|$|E

A testitular examination, <b>spermiogram</b> and determination of FSH, LH, testosterone and prolactin were done to all. Testicular biopsy was done to patients with severe oligospermia or azoospermia. Causes of infertility were defined and classified as pretesticular, testicular, posttesticular or unclassified. Results: Two hundred fifty seven males were studied. In 3. 5 % of them, the cause of infertility was defined as pretesticular (that included hypothalamic and pituitary endocrine causes), in 66. 9 % it was classified as testicular, in 15. 6 % as posttesticular and in 14 %, as unclassified.

For these reasons, we analyzed the acrosomal and sperm surface proteins in men with normal and pathological <b>spermiograms.</b> We found that intra-acrosome proteins: TERA (Transitional endoplasmic reticulum ATPase), GAPDHS (Sperm Glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase), and PRKAR 2 A (C-AMP-dependent protein kinase II, PRKAR 2 A), which can be identified using our monoclonal antibodies, are different express in healthy men and men with astenozoospermia (with reduced sperm motility), and with a significantly reduced expression in the astenozoospermia. These proteins are involved in energy metabolism and apoptosis of the cells, {{and some of them}} in the sperm-egg interaction; therefore, they have an important role in reproduction. On the other hand, there were no statistically significant differences in the expression of surface proteins (Appolipoprotein J (Clusterin) and Semenogelin). Our findings show that astenozoospermia as a complex disorder of the semen is often combined with other pathological conditions that are not diagnosed by the semen analysis.

Materials and methods: We performed 277 consecutive testicular ultrasound examinations from January 2012 to July 2012. Among all these, we selected 86 patients that showed no pathological elements at echography and 11 patients affected by MT, to one or both testicles. Each patient was also submitted to a short-term semen analysis using the WHO 2010 parameters for sperm evaluation. Results: Among 11 patients with MT, 7 (63. 63 %) were dyspermic and 4 (36. 36 %) were normospermic. Among the 86 patients with normal testicular ultrasound 51 (59. 3 %) were dyspermic, 4 (4. 65 %) were azoospermic, while the remaining 31 (36. 05 %) were normospermic.

40|$|Asthenozoospermia {{is one of}} {{the main}} seminal pathologies {{underlying}} male infertility. Previous proteomic studies have demonstrated the significant differences in the protein profiles between normozoospermic and asthenozoospermic sperm samples. Since these studies were primarily focused on the identification of differentially expressed proteins by mass spectrometry, we aimed to evaluate the ability of our diagnostic antibodies to detect the differential expression of selected protein markers by fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry techniques. Therefore, we analyzed sperm samples from 30 men with normal and 30 men with astheno <b>spermiograms,</b> average by the panel of our diagnostic anti-human sperm (Hs) antibodies. Fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry analysis revealed quantitative differences in the protein abundances between normo and astheno sperm samples, namely, in GAPDHs, evaluated with Hs- 8 MoAb, VCP, evaluated with Hs- 14 MoAb, and ATP synthase, evaluated with MoAb Hs- 36. From the methodological point of view, we observed very high correlation between the data obtained by fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry techniques and therefore both methods are useful for evaluation of protein differences associated with asthenozoospermia. From the clinical point of view, we observed the strong association of the low sperm motility in the sample with the expression of proteins, playing an important role in sperm energy metabolism (expected), but also with the expression of all tested intra-acrosomal proteins. These findings further demonstrate asthenozoospermia as a complex semen disorder frequently associated with other semen pathologies, which are not diagnosed by basic semen analysis, and the possibility to use monoclonal antibodies as a tool for diagnosis of protein associated sperm pathologies in the semen with the low sperm motility...|$|R

METHODS: a retrospective study in which the <b>spermiograms</b> of all men in process of investigation for conjugal infertility in a service of assisted reproduction in the Northeast of Brazil were evaluated from September 2002 to December 2004. A number of 531 individuals submitted to 531 spermatic evaluations were included in the study. The following parameters have been analyzed: spermatic volume, concentration, motility and morphology. The men under investigation have been divided in groups, according to the results obtained in each of the variables studied. Seminal volume groups were divided in: hypospermia, normospermia and hyperspermia. Spermatic concentration groups were divided in: azoospermia, oligospermia, normospermia and polyspermia. Motility groups were divided in: normal motility and asthenospermia. Morphology groups were divided in: normal morphology and teratospermia. The t test has been used to compare the average age of patients in groups with normal and in groups with altered parameters. The program XLSTAT (p< 0. 05) has been used for the statistical analysis. RESULTS: the individuals studied presented an average of 37 ± 7. 9 years old, with an average of seminal volume of 3 ± 1. 4 mL, a spermatic concentration of 61. 4 ± 66. 4 spermatozoids by mL of semen, a progressive motility of 44. 7 ± 19. 4 % of the total of spermatozoids and normal morphology of 11. 2 ± 6. 6 % of the spermatozoids. Average age among groups were similar, except for that of individuals with hypospermia, which was significantly higher than the one from men with normospermia (39. 6 ± 10. 3 versus 36. 5 ± 7. 3, p= 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: age interferes in an inversely proportional way on the ejaculated volume, but does not influence spermatic concentration, motility and morphology...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar histologicamente as biópsias testiculares de cães obtidas por punção aspirativa por agulhas fina (PAAF) e “tru cut”. Foram utilizados 40 cães, adultos, hígidos, distribuídos em 2 grupos: G 1 - punção biópsia aspirativa; e G 2 - biópsia com agulha “tru-cut”. Cada grupo foi dividido em quatro subgrupos (Ga, Gb, Gc e Gd) com cinco animais cada, sendo estes orquiectomizados 3, 7, 14 e 62 dias após as biópsias PAAF ou “Tru-cut”. O {{material}} colhido pela PAAF foi submetido à avaliação citológica, e o proveniente da biópsia “tru-cut” e orquiectomia submetidos à histopatologia. Foram avaliados os espermiogramas e mensuração de comprimento e largura do escroto e colhido o soro para pesquisa de anticorpo antiespermatozóides. Referente ao espermiograma e a mensuração do escroto não foram observados diferenças (p> 0, 05) significativas. A amostra direcionada para citologia e histologia obtida pelas duas técnicas foi considerada de quantidade suficiente para diagnóstico. Na histopatologia a PAAF apresentou menor área de lesão e reação inflamatória comparada a “tru cut”, no entanto esta última apresentou maior quantidade de material, preservando a arquitetura dos túbulos seminíferos e interstício. Não foi observado diferença (p> 0, 05) na produção de anticorpos anti-espermatozóides, após as biopsias. Concluímos que apesar das biópsias fornecerem material em qualidade e quantidade adequadas, e da PAAF ter se mostrado menos traumática, a escolha da técnica a ser empregada dependerá da finalidade para o qual o material se destina. The aim of {{this study}} it was evaluate hystologicaly the testicular biopsies in dogs obtained by aspirative puncture by fine needle and “tru-cut”. Forty males dogs, adults, healthies were used, distributed in 2 groups: G 1 – Fine Needle aspiration; and G 2 - biopsy by “Tru-cut”. Each group were shared in four groups (Ga, Gb, Gc e Gd) with 5 animals each, and all of then were orchiectomized after 3, 7, 14, 62 days after the biopsies by FNA and “tru-cut” being performed. The samples collected by FNA were submitted to cytology evaluate, and the sample from tru-cut biopsy and orchiectomy submitted to histopathology. The <b>spermiograms</b> were evaluated, the testicular length and with were measure, and the animal’s blood were collected to the anti-sperm antibody quantification. About the spermogram and measurement of scrotal bag any significative difference was observed (p> 0, 05). The sample to cytology and histology obtained from two techniques showed be in quantity enough to diagnostic. In histopathology, the biopsy FNA showed smaller damage area and inflammatory reaction compared to tru-cut, however this one showed biggest quantity of material, preserving the seminiferous tubules architeture and interstitium. It was not observed significative difference at anti-sperm antibodies production. We concluded that althought the biopsies provide material in quantity and quality appropriate, and the PAAF showed less traumatic, the choose of the technique to be used will depend the purpose for which the material is intended...|$|R

40|$|Background: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the influence of Toxoplasma gondii infection on spermatic and hormonal parameters in a pilot sample of immunocompe­tent human male subjects. Methods: This cross sectional, observational pilot study on 60 immunocompetent hu­man male subjects aged between 18 and 60 yr old was conducted between 2012 - 2013. Blind evaluation of serological markers of past T. gondii infection (TOX-IgG, TOX-IgM) was performed, along with individual spermiograms and determinations of folli­cle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and testosterone serum levels. Results: The overall prevalence of past T. gondii infection in the investigated immunocom­petent male subjects was 25 %. No statistically significant influence of T. gondii infection on sperm characteristics (ejaculate quantity, sperm count, motility, morphol­ogy) and serum levels of FSH or testosterone were found. Among possible predictors of a modified <b>spermiogram</b> studied by multiple logistic regression along with the T. gondii infection (age, smoking, alcohol consumption, fertility influencing malfor­mations, infections, trauma or medication), only the presence of varicocele in the medi­cal history of the studied subjects was found to significantly participate in the predic­tion of a modified <b>spermiogram</b> (P= 0. 0154). A necessary sample size of 994 subjects was computed in order to achieve a test power of 0. 8 (80 %) to discriminate an effect size of 8. 89 % estimated by our pilot study. Conclusions: Although our investigation did not demonstrate an influence of latent T. gondii infection on spermatic and hormonal parameters of immunocompetent male hu­mans, the absence of such an influence cannot be affirmed, due to the limited sample size of our pilot study.   </p...|$|E
40|$|Male {{fertility}} is an orchestrated {{interplay of}} loci on the Y chromosome {{with a number}} of genes from across the other chromosomes. In this context, micro-deletions in the Y chromosome have been correlated with spermatogenic failure often leading to infertility. However, causes of infertility in the patients with the normal <b>spermiogram</b> have remained unclear and therefore pose another level of challenge. In the present study, we analyzed 64 STSs, studied different Y-linked genes and loci and conducted single nucleotide variant (SNV) analyses in 31 infertile males with normal <b>spermiogram</b> along with 67 normal fertile males (NFMs) to gain an insight into the organization of their Y chromosome. Further, employing quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), we studied copy number variation of DYZ 1 arrays and three genes and mutational status of SRY by direct sequence analyses. STS analyses of the AZFa, b and c regions in these patients showed known and new mutations. Further, copies of DAZ and BPY 2 in the patients were found to be affected (p < 0. 001) compared to those in NFMs. All the patients had normal copy number of the SRY however its sequence analysis (in silico) showed mutations in eight patients. In four of these eight patients, SRY mutations resulted into truncated proteins. Similarly, DYZ 1 analysis showed micro-deletions and it's much reduced copy number (p < 0. 001) as compared to those in NFMs. Present study in males with unexplained infertility revealed deletions similar to those observed in oligospermic and azoospermic patients. Thus, there are some common but still unknown factors underlying infertility in these patients irrespective of their spermatogenic status. This work is envisaged to augment DNA diagnosis, proving beneficial in the context of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and genetic counselling...|$|E

Serial measurements of these parameters in routine andro-logical work permit standards for four main <b>spermiogram</b> diagnoses to be established. Laser-Doppler-spectroscopy was used to verify alterations in the motility of spermatozoa after capacitation in an in-vitro fertilization programme. An enhancement of 16 % for total sperm motility and 36 % for mean spermatozoa! velocity could be observed. The results of in-vitro fertilization after various spermigram diagnoses, combined with long-term observations of mean spermatozoal velocity, may be considered as another step towards the elucidation of sperm-oocyte interactions.

All partners provided a <b>spermiogram</b> for the exclusion of male factor infertility. Further exclusion criteria were known causes of uterine malformations, endometrial adhesions and hormonal therapy such as oral contraceptives or other oestrogen–progesterone medications within the last 3  months before hysteroscopy. If necessary, the procedure was combined with a laparoscopy to test the tubal patency, and the hysteroscopy was done in most cases during the same operating session and under general anaesthesia.
