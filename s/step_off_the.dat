5|$|Novelists {{influenced}} by Blyton include the crime writer Denise Danks, whose fictional detective Georgina Powers {{is based on}} George from the Famous Five. Peter Hunt's A <b>Step</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Path (1985) is also {{influenced by}} the Famous Five, and the St. Clare's and Malory Towers series provided the inspiration for Jacqueline Wilson's Double Act (1996) and Adèle Geras's Egerton Hall trilogy (1990–92) respectively.|$|E
25|$|On May 3, 2006, Chen {{canceled}} {{plans to}} pass through the United States on his way to Latin America. He was hoping to stop by either San Francisco or New York City to refuel and stay overnight, but the US refused his request instead limiting him to a brief refuelling stopover in Anchorage, Alaska where Chen {{would not be allowed to}} <b>step</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> plane. Chen and Taiwan saw this as a snub and led to Chen's cancellation. The trip to Latin America will continue, however, without a US stopover. The US State Department claimed that the Alaska stopover offer was consistent with its previous accommodations. However, former Taiwan president Lee Teng-hui was granted a visit to Cornell University eleven years ago. More recently, in addition, Taiwan's leaders have in general been granted permission to stopover in the United States for brief periods before continuing on to other countries. This recent American stance is interpreted by Taiwan to be an expression of the increasing irritation the United States feels towards Taiwan and Chen's seemingly pro-independence gestures. Chen attended the inauguration of Óscar Arias, the president of Costa Rica, one of the few countries that recognized the Republic of China at that time. Laura Bush was also present to represent U.S. president George W. Bush. Chen seized the opportunity, approached her and shook her hands, while Chen's aide produced a camera immediately for an impromptu photo-op. Chen's supporters saw this act as a step forward in Taiwan's struggle for diplomatic recognition, while his detractors claimed that it was a grave breach of international etiquette and put Taiwan to shame.|$|E
500|$|At {{the bottom}} of the ladder Armstrong said, [...] "I'm going to <b>step</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> LEM now" [...] (referring to the Apollo Lunar Module).

Jeff {{promises}} Hayley that, if she spares his life, he will tell her the other man's name so she can exact her revenge.

[...] Janelle arrives, and Hayley once again urges Jeff to hang himself, promising that she will destroy the evidence. Defeated, Jeff lets Hayley slide the noose around his neck, and takes the last fatal <b>step</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> roof; after he falls Hayley says [...] "or not". Hayley then gathers her belongings and escapes through the woods. The film ends as Hayley walks {{down the road in}} her red hoodie.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{world and}} {{characters}} were designed primarily by Gilbert. After having read Tim Powers' historical fantasy novel On Stranger Tides, {{he decided to}} add paranormal themes to the game's plot. He also cited Powers' book as an influence on the characters, particularly those of Guybrush and LeChuck. Inspiration for the game's ambiance came from Gilbert's favorite childhood amusement park ride, Pirates of the Caribbean. Grossman said that Gilbert always wanted [...] "to <b>step</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ride" [...] and [...] "talk {{to the people who}} lived in that world". Near the final stages of the design work, Gilbert introduced several characters who were not directly related to the game's story. He considered this to be an important decision, as the player would need those seemingly minor characters in later parts of the game and would receive a chance to [...] "really interact with them".|$|E
500|$|Two marches were {{organized}} in Portland. The [...] "We the People: Marching in Resistance" [...] rally included groups such as: Oregon's Union Movement, Basic Rights Oregon, Unite Oregon, and the Northwest Oregon Labor Council. The event {{was held at}} Director Park and the groups had a permit to march. Don't Shoot Portland organized a demonstration {{in front of the}} Edith Green – Wendell Wyatt Federal Building, where a small group of protestors faced off with police. This second protest did not have a permit and consisted of a couple of hundred people. The police were in riot gear and pushed the crowd out of the street. Thirteen demonstrators were arrested for blocking traffic. One protester was tackled by the police and then shot with non-lethal projectiles. One man who was reportedly [...] "one <b>step</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> curb" [...] in the street was pushed to the ground by police, had his arms pinned to his back, and was then pepper-sprayed in the face; and a woman was shoved to the sidewalk and then shot by police with [...] "pepper balls". A 66-year-old woman was also tackled and hurt by the police when she attempted to shield her 72-year-old friend from being pushed. Several of the people arrested were minors, with six young people including a 14-year-old being cited. The adults were arrested on charges of disorderly conduct in the second degree, with one man also being charged with resisting arrest and giving false information to the police.|$|E

500|$|X was {{introduced}} on the series via {{a phone call}} made to Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) in the second season episode [...] "The Host", telling Mulder that he had [...] "a friend in the FBI". However, the character did not appear on-screen until [...] "Sleepless", two episodes later, aiding Mulder in an investigation by leaking information on a secret military project from the Vietnam War. [...] While X's loyalties and his own agenda were often unclear, he proved more than once that he at least does not want Mulder dead. In the episode [...] "End Game", he is approached by Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who pleads {{that she needs to}} know where Mulder is, believing his life to be in danger. Initially X refuses, and is subsequently confronted by Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), who seemed to recognize X. He relinquishes Mulder's location, though not until after a brief but intense scuffle with Skinner. In the episode [...] "731", X's loyalty to Mulder is further confirmed. Trapped on a train car equipped with a time bomb, Mulder, about to escape, is attacked brutally by the Red Haired Man, a Men in Black assassin. X fatally shoots the Red Haired Man as he is about to <b>step</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> car, then boards the car with only enough time left to save either Mulder or the alien-human hybrid the car was transporting. He opts to save Mulder, and carries him off to safety just as the car explodes.|$|E
2500|$|Meares and Howell {{documented}} Campese's {{first half}} performance against Argentina in Wallaby Legends by writing that, [...] "Finally, a kick-through was fielded by Marty Roebuck. He counter-attacked, swerving out towards the left wing. He fed Campese – a <b>step</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> left foot, a <b>step</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> right {{and then a}} burst of blistering pace – he was through and over. Five minutes later {{and he was in}} again, this time chiming into the backline and scooting through a chink in the Pumas' defence.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{misconception}} {{occurs when}} in the set position, a pitcher must <b>step</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> rubber before attempting a pick-off or appeal play. Rule 8.01(c) allows a pitcher to pitch, throw to an occupied base, or step off while {{in contact with the}} rubber. [...] The pitcher may also throw to an unoccupied base if appealing that a runner missed a base or left too early on a fly ball.|$|E

2500|$|Aggie {{football}} fans {{call themselves the}} 12th Man, meaning they are there to support the 11 players on the field.

2500|$|While being {{modest and}} diligent under the regency of Minh Tông, the {{independent}} reign of [...] Emperor Dụ Tông saw extravagant {{spending on the}} building of several luxurious palaces and other pleasurely indulgences. Dụ Tông introduced theatre, which was considered {{at the time to}} be a shameful pleasure, in the royal court. Hierarchy and order were completely discarded by the Emperor, and he had the princes and princesses of the royal family do trivial tasks such as folding paper fans in the market. During official audiences, when Dụ Tông felt happy, he would <b>step</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> throne to dance with his ministers. One time, the Emperor was so drunk that he fell into a pool of water and caught a disease that was only cured after a long period of treatment. The Emperor died on 25 May of the Lunar calendar, 1369, at the age of 33 following a reign of twenty-eight years. He did not have any posthumous name and was buried in Phụ Tomb.|$|E
