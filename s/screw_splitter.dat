40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study on hand injury from powered wood {{splitters}} was to describe injury epidemiology and anatomy, to rate injury severity, to evaluate the outcome after injury and to describe factors of possible importance for the occurrence of injury. By searching a computerized patient registry, 131 patients injured by wood splitters from 1995 to 2001 were identified. Information was obtained from hospital records and radiographs, a written questionnaire and a structured telephone interview. Injury severity was rated according to the Hand Injury Severity Scoring System (HISS system) and the Injury Severity Score (ISS). Outcome was evaluated with the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand outcome questionnaire (DASH) and, in 26 of the most severely injured patients, with the Sollerman test. Forty-six percent of the injuries occurred during April or May. Wedge splitters caused 82 % of all injuries and most often injured the index finger, while screw splitters caused 18 % of all injuries and most often injured the metacarpus. Screw splitters caused palmar perforation and thumb avulsion. Sixty-three percent of all patients had an amputation or devascularising injury. The reliability of HISS rating was good. The mean Hand Injury Severity Score (HISS) was 63 which is equivalent to a severe hand injury. The mean ISS was 3. 7. Nineteen percent of patients had minor, 31 % had moderate, 23 % had severe and 27 % had major injury according to the HISS system. Children had more severe injuries than adults. There was no significant difference regarding HISS or DASH scores between wedge and <b>screw</b> <b>splitter</b> injuries. The mean DASH score was 15, indicating moderate residual sequelae, but patients without sequelae and patients with grave sequelae were found in all HISS severity grades. There was a weak but significant correlation between the HISS and DASH scores. The mean Sollerman score in the injured hand was 66, indicating significantly impaired hand function. Twenty-nine percent of splitters were home-made. Very few machines had the safety measures required by European Standards. Children were present during splitting in at least 15 % of cases. Not being alone at the machine was one cause of wedge splitter injury. Glove use was one cause of <b>screw</b> <b>splitter</b> injury. Hand injury from powered wood splitters is a significant problem. Many of the injuries are severe, and cause long term sequels and impairment of hand function. Prevention is essential and should focus on unsafe machines and dangerous patterns of use...|$|E
50|$|No {{matter what}} the power source, a log {{splitter}} either uses a hydraulic piston to drive the log through a stationary blade or a rotating cone shaped screw mandrel that pulls the log up over a wedge. Some models have attachments that prevent the split logs from falling to the ground allowing the operator to reposition the logs quickly for a second pass on the log splitter. Some cone or <b>screw</b> <b>splitters</b> are mounted on steel platforms mounted on a 3-point linkage that allow the log to be repeatedly split into smaller pieces without putting the wood down and up again.|$|R
40|$|A {{case of the}} {{accidental}} death of a 42 -year-old male injured by a <b>screw</b> log <b>splitter</b> in the yard of a private house necessitated a post-mortem examination and the technical evaluation of the machinery. The autopsy revealed fatal traumatic lesions to the head, caused by impact with a downward-moving log. Analysis of {{the scene of the}} accident showed that the machinery was not equipped with safety systems and was used incorrectly by the operators. The decision of the Criminal Court determined the absence of liability of the parties to be persecuted...|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} years, {{the proper design of}} {{agricultural}} machines for both professional and non-professional use has assumed a relevant role in workers protection and accident avoidance. The {{activities related to}} cutting and sawing of firewood is the main cause of injuries or death of the operator. This is often due to the use of inadequately built or modified machines, improper use of equipment and use of tools intended for other purposes. This study aimed to design a conical <b>screw</b> log <b>splitter</b> that meets the criteria of the European Directive 2006 / 42 /EC and the technical standards of EN 609 - 2 : 1999 +A 1 : 2009 (E) guideline. For a proper design we determined the forces that influence the machine during its use, and sized the machine accordingly. The log splitter was scanned and digitalized in three dimensions. From the digital model we obtained a real model in 5 : 1 scale. Comparing the created log splitter with other solutions available on the market we confirmed its similar costs with the costs of tools currently marketed. The productivity of the machine was only slightly lower than that of machines not equipped with protections, but its safety was significantly improve...|$|R
