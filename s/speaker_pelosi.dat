500|$|According to Jonathan Alter's book, , Emanuel opposed Barack Obama's {{plan for}} a broad health care reform, but Obama overrode him. Emanuel {{advocated}} a smaller plan because it could get bipartisan support. Emanuel wanted to expand coverage for children, and increase [...] the number of single mothers eligible for Medicaid. For that reason, it was called [...] "the Titanic plan." [...] Reportedly, House <b>Speaker</b> <b>Pelosi</b> had to convince Obama {{on the health care}} initiative after Emanuel dramatically scaled it back. Emanuel has since apologized for his role, saying [...] "Thank God for the country he didn’t listen to me," [...] after the Supreme Court upheld Obamacare in 2012.|$|E
500|$|Supporters of Rangel {{argued that}} by {{comparison}} with previous cases, a reprimand {{would be a more}} fitting punishment for Rangel's trangressions than censure. [...] Rangel repeatedly insisted, as he had all along, that nothing he had done was with the aim of enriching himself. [...] It was to no avail. [...] On December 2, 2010, a motion was made in the full House to censure Rangel. [...] Ethics committee chair Zoe Lofgren emphasized that it was Rangel's [...] "accumulation of actions" [...] that warranted the stiffer penalty, and said that the treatment of Rangel should set a new precedent, not follow old ones. [...] A motion to amend the resolution in favor of reprimand was voted down 267–146; most of Speaker Pelosi's allies rejected it and over 105 Democrats voted the resolution down. [...] The House of Representatives then voted 333–79 to censure Rangel. Per custom, Rangel went to the well of the House to hear <b>Speaker</b> <b>Pelosi</b> solemnly read the formal measure of censure. It had been 27 years since the last such measure and Rangel was only the 23rd House member to be censured. Rangel asked to speak and said, [...] "I know in my heart I am not going to be judged by this Congress. I’ll be judged by my life in its entirety." ...|$|E
