50|$|About 100 {{lightning}} strokes {{per second}} are generated {{all over the}} world excited by thunderstorms located mainly in the continental areas at low and middle latitudes. In order to monitor the thunderstorm activity, <b>sferics</b> are the appropriate means.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sferics</b> can be {{simulated}} approximately by {{the electromagnetic}} radiation field of a vertical Hertzian dipole antenna. The maximum spectral amplitude of the sferic typically is near 5 kHz. Beyond this maximum, the spectral amplitude decreases as 1/f if the Earth's surface were perfectly conducting.

50|$|A {{lightning}} channel {{with all its}} branches and its electric currents behaves like a huge antenna system from which electromagnetic waves of all frequencies are radiated. Beyond a distance where luminosity is visible and thunder can be heard (typically about 10 km), these electromagnetic impulses are the only sources of direct information about thunderstorm activity on the ground. Transients electric currents during return strokes (R strokes) or intracloud strokes (K strokes) are the main sources for the generation of impulse-type electromagnetic radiation known as <b>sferics</b> (sometimes called atmospherics). While this impulsive radiation dominates at frequencies less than about 100 kHz, (loosely called long waves), a continuous noise component becomes increasingly important at higher frequencies. The longwave electromagnetic propagation of <b>sferics</b> takes place within the Earth-ionosphere waveguide between the Earth's surface and the ionospheric D- and E- layers. Whistlers generated by lightning strokes can propagate into the magnetosphere along the geomagnetic lines of force. Finally, upper atmospheric lightning or sprites, that occur at mesospheric altitudes, are short-lived electric breakdown phenomena, probably generated by giant lightning events on the ground.|$|E
50|$|For smaller aircraft, {{especially}} in general aviation, {{there are two}} main brands of lightning detectors (often referred to as <b>sferics,</b> short for radio atmospherics): Stormscope, produced originally by Ryan (later B.F. Goodrich) and currently by L-3 Communications, and the Strikefinder, produced by Insight. Lightning detectors are inexpensive and lightweight, making them attractive to owners of light aircraft (particularly of single-engine aircraft, where the aircraft nose is not available for installation of a radome).|$|E
5000|$|A radio {{atmospheric}} signal or sferic (sometimes also spelled [...] "spheric") is a broadband electromagnetic impulse {{that occurs}} {{as a result}} of natural atmospheric lightning discharges. <b>Sferics</b> may propagate from their lightning source without major attenuation in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide, and can be received thousands of kilometers from their source. On a time-domain plot, a sferic may appear as a single high-amplitude spike in the time-domain data. On a spectrogram, a sferic appears as a vertical stripe (reflecting its broadband and impulsive nature) that may extend from a few kHz to several tens of kHz, depending on atmospheric conditions.|$|E

According to an interview with Andy Jackson, recording engineer for the album, this noise is electromagnetic noise from the solar wind. More precisely, this sound is a very low frequency record of dawn chorus and <b>sferics,</b> radio events respectively due to solar wind interference with Earth's magnetosphere, and lightning strikes radio emissions interfering with Ionosphere; this sound has been mistaken for Earth's crust shifting and cracking.|$|E

5000|$|VLF waves {{have very}} low path attenuation, 2-3 dB per 1000 km, with {{little of the}} [...] "fading" [...] {{experienced}} at higher frequencies, [...] This is because VLF waves are reflected {{from the bottom of}} the ionosphere, while higher frequency shortwave signals are returned to Earth from higher layers in the ionosphere, the F1 and F2 layers, by a refraction process, and spend most of their journey in the ionosphere, so they are much more affected by ionization gradients and turbulence. Therefore, VLF transmissions are very stable and reliable, and are used for long distance communication. Propagation distances of 5000 to 20000 km have been realized. [...] However, atmospheric noise (<b>sferics)</b> is high in the band, including such phenomena as [...] "whistlers", caused by lightning.|$|E
50|$|The signal {{strength}} of radio waves decreases the farther they travel from the transmitter, so {{the range of}} a system depends {{on the power of}} the transmitter and the sensitivity of the receiver. AM broadcast band radio waves travel as ground waves which follow the contour of the Earth, so AM radio stations can be reliably received at hundreds of miles distance. Due to their higher frequency, FM band radio signals do not travel far beyond the visual horizon; limiting reception distance to about 40 miles (64 km), and can be blocked by hills between the transmitter and receiver. However FM radio is less susceptible to interference from radio noise (RFI, <b>sferics,</b> static) and has higher fidelity; better frequency response and less audio distortion, than AM. So in many countries serious music is only broadcast by FM stations, and AM stations specialize in radio news, talk radio, and sports.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a typical}} cloud-to-ground stroke (R stroke), {{negative}} electric charge (electrons) {{of the order}} of Q = 1 C stored within the lightning channel is lowered to the ground within a typical impulse time interval of τ = 100 μs. This corresponds to an average current flowing within the channel {{of the order of}} J = Q/τ = 10 kA. Maximum spectral energy is generated near frequencies of f = 1/τ = 10 kHz, or at wavelengths of λ = c/f = 30 km (c is the speed of light). In typical intracloud K strokes, positive electric charge of the order of C = 10 mC in {{the upper part of the}} channel and an equivalent amount of negative charge in its lower part neutralize within a typical time interval of τ = 25 μs. The corresponding values for average electric current, frequency and wavelength are J = 400 A, f = 40 kHz, and λ = 7.5 km. The energy of K strokes is in general two orders of magnitude weaker than the energy of R strokes. The typical length of lightning channels can be estimated to be of the order of L = λ/4 = 8 km for R strokes and L= λ/2 = 4 km for K strokes. Often, a continuing current component flows between successive R strokes. Its [...] "pulse" [...] time typically varies between about 10 to 150 ms, its electric current is of the order of J = 100 A, corresponding to the numbers of Q = 1 to 20 C, f = 7 to 100 Hz and λ = 3 to 40 Mm. Both R strokes as well as K strokes produce <b>sferics</b> seen as a coherent impulse waveform within a broadband receiver tuned to 1 - 100 kHz. The electric field strength of the impulse increases to a maximum value within a few microseconds and then declines like a damped oscillator. The orientation of the field strength increase depends on whether it is a negative or a positive discharge ...|$|E

30|$|These <b>sferics</b> are {{characterized}} by a sudden impulse in the time domain and {{can be divided into}} two main frequency bands, namely those above 1  kHz and those below it. In the low-frequency band of extremely low-frequency (ELF) waves, <b>sferics</b> consist of a high-amplitude impulse (Fig.  3) called the slow tail (Mackay and Fraser-Smith 2010), whereas in the high-frequency band of very low-frequency (VLF) waves, <b>sferics</b> are mainly shaped as oscillations. To analyze ELF waves using the CWT, we have chosen the Cauchy wavelet. Most of the previous work on MT methods with wavelets was based on the Morlet wavelet stemming from its properties of good resolution in terms of both the time and frequency (Zhang and Paulson 1997; Garcia and Jones 2008). However, the shape of the ELF wave (Fig.  4 a) is very impulsive and therefore wide in frequency, so it is closer to Cauchy’s shape than to Morlet’s one. Indeed, the ELF wave is very short in time and has very few oscillations, so we need a wavelet that has similar properties. As illustrated in Fig.  4 b, c, the highest coefficients obtained with the Morlet wavelet span a wide time length, i.e., longer than the actual length of the ELF wave. Because of their impulsive nature, <b>sferics</b> have a wide frequency content (Mackay and Fraser-Smith 2010). In the time–frequency domain, <b>sferics</b> appear as a series of high-valued coefficients along the frequency axis (very localized in time and spread out in frequency).|$|E

This study summarizes our results from <b>sferics</b> signals at 81 kHz and subionospheric transmitted signals at 19. 8 and 40 kHz recorded at Agartala, Tripura (latitude: 23 ¢XN, longitude: 91. 4 ¢XE). We observed significant absorption in amplitude of these signals during the eclipse period compared to their ambient values for the same period during the adjacent 7 days. The signal strength along their propagation paths was controlled by the eclipse associated decrease in ionization in the D-region of the ionosphere. Waveguide mode theory calculations show that the elevation of the height of lower ionosphere boundary of the Earth-ionosphere waveguide to a value where the conductivity parameter was 106 unit. The absorption in 81 kHz <b>sferics</b> amplitude is high compared to the absorption in the amplitude of 40 kHz signal transmitted from Japan.

An experimental network of five ground-based radio receivers, was situated along the US east coast and Puerto Rico. That network measured <b>sferics</b> between July 1997 and February 1998. In this study, <b>sferics</b> distributions from this experimental network are compared to lightning data form the US National Lightning Detector Network (NLDN) and the Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) onboard the TRMM satellite. An analysis which neglected non-linear propagation effects on pulse shapes produced location errors up to 100 kilometers due to uncertainties in signal processing, phase velocity modeling, and radio receivers ’ spatial configuration effects. After applying statistical corrections, North Atlantic Ocean and northwest South America regions location errors were reduced to less than 50 km. Expected errors derived from Monte Carlo simulation for this experimental network agreed with the errors retrieved from independent measurements with some moderate disagreement over {{the west coast of}} US. A location error correction scheme is developed, which combines theoretical and experimental models along with satellite infrared observations.
