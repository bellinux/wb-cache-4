50|$|At the factory, Bender was {{programmed}} for cold-bending structural <b>steel.</b> <b>Bender</b> later attended Bending State University, {{where he}} majored in bending and minored in Robo-American Studies. At the university, {{he was a}} member of Epsilon Rho Rho (ERR), a robot fraternity, where he became something of a fraternity hero for his many shenanigans: one night he chugged an entire keg of beer, streaked across campus, and stuffed 58 people into a telephone booth (although he concedes they were mostly children).|$|E
50|$|The Angle Ring Company Limited is an {{engineering}} {{firm based in}} Tipton, West Midlands, England. It was founded in 1951 at a site in Bloomfield Road, and has since expanded {{to become one of}} the most prominent <b>steel</b> <b>benders</b> / curvers of metal and alloys in its market. By 1980, it was Britain's largest steel bending firm and ten years later was exporting its goods to foreign markets.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the roles of reinforcement in the Collapse of buildings in Nigeria. The study {{was carried out by}} means of interview administered to <b>steel</b> <b>benders</b> and observation of steel work on construction sites of private building owners in Ondo State of Nigeria. Information from the forty-eight building projects ranging from one storey to two storeys formed the data, on which the study is based. The study showed that: in columns, 60. 4 % of building projects utilized (less than or equals to 11. 5 mm diameter) inadequate size of reinforcement rods; in beams/lintels 75 % of projects utilized (less than or equals to 11. 5 mm) inadequate size of reinforcement rods; in upper floor slab 64. 6 % of projects utilized (less than or equals to 11. 5 mm) adequate size of reinforcement rods. The result also showed that: in columns 64. 6 % of the projects used (3 No reinforcement rods instead of 4) inadequate number of reinforcement rods, in beams/lintel 75 % of projects utilized (3 No reinforcement rods instead of 4) inadequate number reinforcement rods. In upper floor slab 75 % of projects studied utilized (100 mm- 150 mm centres to centres) adequate centre to centre arrangement. At the openings (doors windows) 50 % of projects studied utilized (less than 300 mm as projection on both sides) inadequate projection at both sides of opening. It is recommended that clients especially prospective private building owners employ structural Engineers {{to take care of the}} structural aspects of their building projects...|$|R
40|$|Hong Kong is {{notorious for}} her high {{construction}} accidents rates. Although the accidents rate {{has dropped from}} 350 per 1000 workers in mid 1980 to 60 per 1000 workers in 2007, it still accounted for nearly one-fifth of all the industrial accidents in Hong Kong. Contractors were economically pressed and battered by exorbitant compensation over the years. This paper presents a comprehensive study of non-fatal accidents compensation court cases from 2004 to 2008. Although approximately one-third of the cases with injured persons aged between 47 and 56, the percentage of court cases over construction employees by age group was highest in age group 17 - 26. In terms of trade of workers, General laborers/causal workers stood the highest, then came electrical technicians and painters/decorators/plasterers. The highest rates of injury were falling from height and hitting by falling objects. Increasing from HK$ 10, 997, 637 in 2004, the total compensation reached the peak of HK$ 39, 643, 353 in 2006. The heaviest compensation was HK$ 13, 800, 000 among 101 cases. Most {{of the victims were}} compensated under loss of earnings and Pain Suffering and Loss of Amenities. While general labourers marked the highest number of cases, less than one-fourth of them were awarded compensation which exceeded HK$ 1, 500, 000. Four out of seven <b>steel</b> <b>benders</b> who filed court cases, however, received compensation greater than HK$ 1. 5 million for each case. Those who were struck by objects had relatively the highest chance to be compensated with a huge sum of money. </p...|$|R
