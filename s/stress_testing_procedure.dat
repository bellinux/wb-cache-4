40|$|Abstract. Numerical {{simulations}} in {{machining processes}} {{are dependent on}} the flow stress input data. The flow stress is computed from empirical models which depend on number of material parameters, the values of which are derived from various mathematical optimization techniques. The derived flow stress parameters vary based {{on the nature of}} techniques used and the flow <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> <b>procedure</b> utilized. This results in variations in the numerical simulation results when working with different models. In this work, the Johnson Cook flow stress model is tested for its sensitivity towards the finite element (FE) results. Orthogonal turning is conducted with AA 6082 (T 6) aluminium alloy and the process is simulated in Deform 2 D. The flow stress computed from the Johnson Cook model is input to the FE code and the cutting force and chip thickness recorded. The FE results are input to the Minitab statistical code and an optimization process conducted based on the orthogonal arrays concept. The comparative study reveals the sensitivity of the five parameters of the material model towards the cutting force and chip thickness...|$|E
40|$|Stress {{testing is}} a general term for {{framework}} that assesses possible impact of an adverse shock on the financial health and a capital adequacy of a bank, other financial institution or the whole financial system. Because credit risk is typically the most important risk of a bank and many international surveys describe the credit risk stress testing {{as one of the}} least developed, it became the main topic of this thesis. Credit risk stress testing methods developed in the last years very dynamically especially thanks to the requirements on stress testing under the Basel II regulatory framework and a fact that further improvement of these methods is expected to ensure higher financial stability of institutions and financial sector to adverse shocks and enable to withstand severe crisis. The thesis concentrates on the micro level stress tests that are run by each individual bank. It describes the whole credit risk <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> <b>procedure,</b> Basel II regulatory requirements, the importance of this framework for an institution and offers examples of possible stress testing methods and scenarios.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this thesis is to develop methodological and {{practical}} improvements on robust portfolio optimization procedures. Firstly, the thesis discusses the drawbacks of classical mean-variance optimization models, and examines robust portfolio optimization procedures with CVaR and worst-case CVaR risk models by providing a clear presentation of derivation of robust optimization models from a basic VaR model. For practical purposes, the thesis introduces an open source software interface called “RobustRisk”, which is developed for producing empirical evidence for the robust portfolio optimization models. The software, which performs Monte-Carlo simulation and out-of-sample performance for the portfolio optimization, is introduced by using a hypothetical portfolio data from selected emerging markets. In addition, the performance of robust portfolio optimization procedures are discussed by providing empirical evidence in the crisis period from advanced markets. Empirical results show that robust optimization with worst-case CVaR model outperforms the nominal CVaR model in the crisis period. The empirical results encourage us to construct a forward-looking <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> based on robust portfolio optimization under regime switches. For this purpose, the Markov chain process is embedded into robust optimization procedure in order to stress regime transition matrix. In addition, assets returns, volatilities, correlation matrix and covariance matrix can be stressed under pre-defined scenario expectations. An application is provided with a hypothetical portfolio representing an internationally diversified portfolio. The CVaR efficient frontier and corresponding optimized portfolio weights are achieved under regime switch scenarios. The research suggests that stressed-CVaR optimization provides a robust and forward-looking <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> {{to comply with the}} regulatory requirements stated in Basel II and CRD regulations...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} how the Radio Frequency (RF) {{waveform}} measurement and engineering techniques developed for Power Amplifier (PA) design {{can be used to}} investigate RF reliability. Within this area two major themes are concentrated on – firstly the effect of a load impedance mismatch and secondly an investigation into using the RF IV waveform measurement system for RF stress testing. The initial aim for this work was to investigate the potential for removing the output protection isolator from a PA. It was seen that in doing so there is the potential to cause an impedance mismatch, which results in a portion of the power produced being reflected back. It was shown that the conditions that could be presented to a device {{as a result of an}} impedance mismatch can be found by performing a Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) sweep. The results of the worst possible case scenario VSWR sweep, when all of the power is reflected back, can be split into three regions. One of high RF drain voltage swings, one of high RF drain currents and a transition region of simultaneously high RF drain currents and voltage swings. Each of these regions presents different operating conditions to the device, and in turn different stresses. The second part of this thesis concentrates on an investigation into Gallium Nitride (GaN) Heterostructure Field Effect Transistor (HFET) reliability, specifically if the RF waveform measurement system can be used to provide detailed information about the state of the device during RF stress testing. A <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> <b>procedure</b> was developed to allow this, which featured both DC and RF characterisation measurements before and after every stress period. It was shown that the measurements made during the characterisation stages only gives a representation of the degradation seen in the same measurements during the RF stress period...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} new method for {{analysing}} multiperiod stress scenarios for portfolio credit risk more systematically {{than in the}} current practice of macro <b>stress</b> <b>testing.</b> Our method quantifies the plausibility of scenarios by considering {{the distance of the}} stress scenario from an average scenario. For a given level of plausibility our method searches systematically for the most adverse scenario for the given portfolio. This method therefore gives a formal criterion for judging the plausibility of scenarios and it makes sure that no plausible scenario will be missed. We show how this method can be applied to a range of models already in use among <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> practitioners. While worst case search requires numerical optimisation we show that for practically relevant cases we can work with reasonably good linear approximations to the portfolio loss function that make the method computationally very efficient and easy to implement. Applying our approach to data from the Spanish loan register and using a portfolio credit risk model we show that, compared to standard <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> <b>procedures,</b> our method identifies more harmful scenarios that are equally plausible. <b>Stress</b> <b>Testing,</b> Credit Risk, Worst Case Search, Maximum Loss...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} a proposed qualification standard for photovoltaic concentrator modules. The standard's {{purpose is to}} provide <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> and <b>procedures</b> to identify any component weakness in photovoltaic concentrator modules intended for power generation applications.

40|$|An {{integrated}} simulation {{and testing}} approach {{is presented to}} evaluate batteries for electric vehicle (EV) applications. This new approach combines traditional experimental testing with computer simulations to create a cost-effective means to evaluate EV batteries and provide important information that is difficult or impossible to obtain from purely experimental measurements. The present simulators for the lead-acid and Ni-MH batteries are developed based on the fundamental principles governing their electrochemical behaviors and are created using an advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique. Computer simulations are validated by experimental data under the dynamic <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> (DST) <b>procedure</b> for a lead-acid battery module and a Ni-MH cell with good agreement. Moreover, computer simulations reveal that the studied lead-acid battery under-utilizes the active material {{by as much as}} 70 % and the MH electrode of the Ni-MH cell is over-designed by about 30 % under the simulated EV duty. Therefore, there is good potential of increasing the specific energy and reducing the cost if batteries are optimized for electric vehicles using a simulation-based design approach...|$|R
40|$|Purpose–The {{purpose of}} this paper is to build an easy to implement, pragmatic and parsimonious yet {{accurate}} model to determine an exposure at default (EAD) distribution for CCL (contingent credit lines) portfolios. Design/methodology/approach–Using an algorithm similar to the basic CreditRisk+ and Fourier Transforms, the authors arrive at a portfolio level probability distribution of usage. Findings–The authors perform a simulation experiment which illustrates the convolution of two portfolio segments to derive an EAD distribution, chosen randomly from Moody's Default Risk Service (DRS) database of CCLs rated as of 12 / 31 / 2008, to derive an EAD distribution. The standard deviation of the usage distribution is found to decrease as we increase the number of puts used, but the mean value remains relatively stable, as the extreme points converge towards the mean to produce a shrinkage in the spread of the distribution. The authors also observe, for the sample portfolio, that an increase in the additional usage rate level also increases the volatility of the associated exposure distribution. Practical implications–This model, in conjunction with internal bank financial institution research, can be used for banks' EAD estimation as mandated by Basel II for bank CCL portfolios, or implemented as part of a Solvency II process for insurers exposed to credit sensitive unfunded commitments. Apart from regulatory requirements, distributions of stochastic exposure generated can be inputs for different economic capital models and <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> <b>procedures</b> used to capture an accurate risk profile of the portfolio, as well as providing better insights into the problem of managing liquidity risk for a portfolio of CCLs and similar exposures. Originality/value–In-spite of the large volume of CCLs in portfolios of financial institutions all (for commercial banks holding these as well as for insurance companies having analogous exposures), paucity of EAD models, unsuitability of external data and inconsistent internal data with partial draw-downs have been a major challenge for risk managers as well as regulators in managing CCL portfolios.

Extensive laboratory experiments are carried out to assess the influence of parameters such as transducer/amplifier frequency response, signal definition parameters, stress rate, strain rate, specimen size, stress level, delay time, temperature, water content, confining pressure, and directional loading on the Kaiser Effect of Stanstead granite and other rock types.

The <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> offered valuable information for the quantification study of fatty acid requirements in marine fish larvae.

However, this potential has been been realized in practice due to some drawbacks which include problems associated with strain rates, soil disturbance, and stress environment during a pressuremeter test. ^ A calibration chamber system and <b>testing</b> <b>procedures</b> to perform chamber pressuremeter tests in cohesive soils were developed in this research. More than twenty model pressuremeter tests have been performed in the chamber. A method based on the Simplex curve fitting technique was developed to derive soil stress strain relationship from pressuremeter data. A <b>stress</b> controlled holding <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> and its interpretation using a finite difference program were developed. One dimensionally (K(,o)) consolidated triaxial tests and oedometer tests were conducted to provide reference soil parameters. ^ Results of the model pressuremeter tests show that the initial shear modulus as derived from the pressuremeter interpretation increases with strain rate and is very sensitive to stress disturbance. The peak principal stress difference decreases with strain rate; after reaching a minimum value, the peak stress difference then increases with the strain rate. As strain rate increases, the interpreted soil stress strain relationship becomes more strain softening. The stress disturbance affects the measurements of initial lateral earth pressure and initial shear modulus but has little impact on {{the latter part of the}} test. The limit pressure is relatively insensitive to strain rate and stress disturbance. The horizontal coefficient of consolidation (c(,h)) from <b>stress</b> controlled holding <b>tests</b> in normally consolidated samples are very close to those determined from horizontal oedometer tests under virgin loading. ...|$|R
