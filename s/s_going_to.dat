5000|$|Craig {{tells the}} contestants {{that in this}} next {{challenge}} they will be saving more than just their team if they win. At the challenge, the contestants are told that they must save four Midget Macs from the ocean, similar to I Love New York 2, when Buddha saved Midget Mac from drowning in the water hole. The team captains are [...] for the Gold Team and Brandi C. for the Green Team. Because the Gold Team has two extra members, [...] must select two people to sit out, but she cannot sit out Hoopz because she sat out last time. [...] picks Rodeo and The Entertainer to sit out the challenge. The competition starts and 12 Pack and Chance dash towards the water. 12 Pack swims very quickly, but Chance, who is wearing a life jacket, does a doggy paddle. 12 Pack goes to the farthest Midget Mac and begins bringing it back when Chance gets to his, which is the second-farthest. They get to the shore {{and the rest of}} their team can now put the Macs on a stretcher and bring them behind their team lines. After 12 Pack returns Heather goes for the second farthest Midget Mac. Once Chance finally returns, Megan goes next. Whiteboy and the other guys are aroused when Megan, who is wearing a red bikini, begins to run out into the ocean to save the second closest Midget Mac. Brandi C. says Megan looks cute and that its just like Baywatch. Megan says shes upset that she has to swim so fast to make up for Chance. Next, Toastee and [...] go together to the closest one, which is submerged underwater. It is attached by a clip which Toastee cannot undo, but [...] refuses to help her because shes too afraid, and they waste a lot of time. Megan returns and Whiteboy goes out for the farthest Midget Mac. Whiteboy returns, and Real and Brandi C. go together to their closest and final Mac. Toastee and [...] finally get their Midget Mac free and start bringing him to shore as he falls apart. Hoopz goes for the second closest Mac and returns before Brandi C. and Real get theirs back meaning the Gold Team wins. After the challenge Megan tries to convince [...] that she needs to eliminate one of the Stallionaires, because the Green Team has only five members meaning that Brandi C., Megan, and one of the Stallionare will be put in the strongbox. [...] as Paymaster is unsure if she should break her alliance with the Stallionaires or not. In the vault, Megan and Brandi C. are voted into the box and Chance volunteers to put his check in the box for his poor performance. At their power outing with , they go to a spa, but Chance hardly talks and acts like hed rather be anywhere else, stating that since him and [...] are already in alliance he does not need to prove himself. When Megan calls him out for not trying to save his self, he yells at her. Megan realizes that shes in danger of going home and she {{must find a way to}} save herself. [...] is then given time to spend one-on-one and chooses Megan because she had wanted to tell [...] something in private. Megan tells [...] that the Stallionares will only use Toastee and her as sacrifices later in the game because they are at the bottom of the chain in their alliance. Megan also says that she is the only one that has not been captain on her team, so if Megan becomes captain next challenge and the Green Team wins, Megan will be Paymaster and [...] will be saved. [...] is unsure if the Stallionare Alliance will allow Megan to become captain and voices her opinion to Megan. Megan replies that if someone else is captain, Megan and Brandi C. will throw the challenge and the Gold Team will win, saving [...] Megan also tells her that Megan, Brandi C., , and Toastee can form a new [...] "Secret Alliance" [...] to get the other alliances out. [...] is very impressed with Megans offers, because they guarantee her safety. Back at the house, Hoopz tries to convince [...] to get rid of Megan because she is manipulative, and Hoopz thinks Megan will easily control [...] [...] considers Hoopzs reasoning because [...] and Megan do not like each other ever since [...] stated she wanted a boob-job if she won the money and Megan said in front of everybody [...] "Saggy boobs suck." [...] At elimination, [...] gives her first check to Brandi C., for her weakness. Then she calls up Megan, and Chance believes that <b>s</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> tell her shes going home. [...] states every reason she does not like Megan and why she should not trust her, and then gives her the check, thus eliminating Chance. 12 Pack is happy someone finally took out a Stallionaire, but Hoopz, Whiteboy, Real and Chance freak out and get very upset, spewing profanity and threats toward [...] Chance gets his check voided and angrily leaves. [...] now realizes shes a major target of the Stallionare Alliance.|$|E

Using a controlled experiment, we examine the role of nurture in explaining the stylized fact that women shy away from competition. Our subjects (students just under 15 years of age) attend publicly-funded single-sex and coeducational schools. We find robust differences between the competitive choices of girls from single-sex and coed schools. Moreover, girls from single-sex schools behave more like boys even when randomly assigned to mixed-sex experimental groups. Thus it is untrue that the average female avoids competitive behaviour {{more than the average}} male.

40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to {{evaluate}} the Soret effect in liquid Fe-Ni-S-P alloys {{in order to gain}} a better understanding of the physical and thermodynamic properties of metallic liquids and to assess the possibility of systematic errors in Czochralski growth techniques. The metal-sulfide liquids were found to show a substantial Soret effect and, contrary to previous expectation, can be as large as that seen in the silicate system. The segregation is largely produced by S-Fe interactions. The P redistribution occurs to reduce activity gradients in P consequent upon S gradients, and P segregation can be approximately predicted in Fe-Ni-S liquids using the activity model of Jones and Malvin (1990). It is inferred that the sense of the Soret segregation, with P going to the cold end and <b>S</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the hot end, is in accordance with the prediction of Malvin et al.
