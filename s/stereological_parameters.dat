40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} {{was to investigate the}} association between renal structural parameters and renal function. The structural parameters were renal cortical volume, total renal volume, number of glomeruli, and total glomerular volume, and renal function was expressed by the single kidney GFR (skGFR). Investigations were performed using both healthy and chronically diseased kidneys. We investigated which of the structural parameters showed the best correlation to renal function and evaluated the possibility of predicting the renal function from structural parameters. Methods Twenty-four pigs, twelve with healthy kidneys and twelve with diseased kidneys, underwent skGFR measurements. Nephrectomies were performed and structural parameters were estimated using stereological procedures. The correlation between the structural parameters and skGFR was analysed by Pearson's correlation test. The prediction of skGFR from structural parameters was analysed by a linear regression test. Results In general, we demonstrated a good correlation between structural parameters and skGFR. When all kidneys were evaluated together Pearson's correlation coefficient between skGFR and any <b>stereological</b> <b>parameter</b> was above 0. 60 and highly significant (p Conclusion The observed correlations between structural parameters and renal function suggest that these parameters may potentially be useful as surrogate markers of the renal function.

40|$|Abstract. In this work, it {{is shown}} that the contiquity ratio, Crr, defined as the {{fraction}} of the total grain boundary area of recrystallized grains shared by other recrystallized grains, is a useful experimental parameter for describing the clustering of recrystallization nuclei in partially recrystallized microstructures. Two experimental examples are presented where anisotropic impingement behavior, i. e. non random recrystallized grain distributions, is thought to be important. In the experimental examples, the deviation of Crr from Crr = Vv which is a characteristic of a random distribution, is clearly shown. The results justify the need for these cases to be modelled, as had been done, by impingement patterns other than the simple random nucleation behavior so often postulated without proof in recrystallization kinetics studies. Introductio Partially recrystallized microstructures are systems containing two constituents- a particulate (embedded recrystallized grain) “phase ” and the matrix (deformed volumes). The recrystallized grains are defined by their grain boundaries. These grain boundaries may separate the recrystallized grains from the deformed volumes or from other recrystallized grains. The contiguity ratio [1] is a measureable <b>stereological</b> <b>parameter</b> which relates to the spacial distribution or dispersion of the embedded recrystallized grains. In terms of grain boundary area densities, the contiguity, Crr, is given by [1] rrC...|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} {{developed}} a comprehensive methodological framework for characterizing geometrical and morphological aspects of pore space in cementitious materials and explored its application to actual cement pastes and model concretes {{for the purpose of}} predicting mechanical and transport properties of cementitious materials. The evolution of pore structure during the hydration process is studied as a function of technical parameters such as cement particle size distribution, water cement (w/c) ratio and degree of hydration. This issue is approached by quantitative image analysis techniques, stereological estimation, and by mathematical morphology methods. The research is carried out in two parallel approaches, i. e., computer simulation by the SPACE (Software Package for the Assessment of Compositional Evolution) system and experimental investigations based on quantitative image analysis of actual specimen sections. Stereological theory is used to derive three-dimensional (3 D) structural information including porosity and specific surface area from two-dimensional (2 D) sections, thus avoiding the extremely laborious character of serial sectioning. Spacing parameters (e. g. nearest neighboring distance, mean free spacing) in stereological theory are adopted to represent the spatial dispersion of solid phases, and thereby provide information on pore size. On the other hand, mathematical morphology measurements (e. g. covariance function, opening distribution technique) are performed on model concretes and on section images of actual cement pastes for quantitative characterization of pore structure. Mechanical and transport properties of cementitious materials can be predicted with the empirical models {{on the basis of the}} derived structural information. A proposal is formulated in this study to refine the Katz-Thompson equation for estimating permeability of cements and concretes, by means of incorporating a new <b>stereological</b> <b>parameter</b> (the so-called 3 D pore distribution density). In addition, the stochastic concept of heterogeneity is discussed on the basis of local porosity analysis of pore structure and demonstrated by a comparison study of cement pastes with different degrees of maturity. The research outcomes provide important implications for microstructural analysis of cementitious materials and for experimental design in concrete technology. The structural evolution and properties of the interfacial transition zone (ITZ) between cement paste and aggregate, as well as the depercolation threshold of capillary porosity has been explored in view of the morphological aspects of model concretes.

To these effects we would now like to add induction of differentiation, based on biological analysis of xenografted human neuroblastoma (SH-SY 5 Y, WAG rnu/rnu) treated with the angiogenesis inhibitor TNP- 470. Treatment with TNP- 470 (10 mg/kg s. c., n = 15) reduced the tumor growth by 66 % and <b>stereological</b> vascular <b>parameters</b> (LV, VV, SV) by 36 – 45 %. The tumor cell apoptotic fraction increased more than threefold, resulting in a decrease in viable tumor cells by 33 %. In contrast, the mean vascular diameter (29 μm) and the mean tumor cell proliferative index (49 %) were unaffected. TNP- 470 -treated tumors exhibited striking chromaffin differentiation of neuroblastoma cells, observed as increased expression of insulin-like growth factor II gene (+ 88 %), tyrosine hydroxylase (+ 96 %), chromogranin A, and cellular processes. Statistical analysis revealed an inverse correlation between differentiation and angiogenesis.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to compare two methods {{quantifying}} eumelanins and pheomelanins, pigments synthesized by melanocytes. One is based on the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) quantitation of specific degradation products of each melanin type. The other requires image analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and stereology. This study was carried out in cultured human melanoma cells and for each line, melanins were measured by HPLC and cells were fixed and embedded as pellets for TEM. Ultrathin sections were treated or not by the alkali elution method allowing the elimination of pheomelanins. The obtained micrographs were analyzed with our image analysis program permitting the estimation of several primary parameters. Stereology was used for estimating melanosomal maturation, intracellular melanins content, and number of melanized melanosomes per cell, for total melanin, eumelanins, or pheomelanins. Our results show a good correlation between both methods for total melanin, particularly when using the cytoplasmic volume density of melanin (r= 0. 93). Moreover, we report that the number of melanized melanosomes per cell and not the melanosomal maturation is responsible for the differences in total melanin content observed between the different cell lines. However, none of the <b>stereological</b> melanization <b>parameters</b> was correlated in the case of eumelanins or pheomelanins. In order to demonstrate the utter relevancy of this stereological approach, utilization of more pigmented melanoma cells, comparative study of HPLC and stereology, in normal epidermal melanocytes and a new evaluation of the alkali elution method in appropriate animal models would help us to explain the present results.

It induces apoptosis, interferes with endocrine function by changing the sex hormones secretion and leads to male infertility. Testosterone is produced from cholesterol by Leydig cells (LC), with the participation of testicular macrophages (MO). Thus, to investigate whether nicotine administration to pregnant and lactating rats changes cholesterol and sexual hormone levels and LC and MO populations of offspring, female rats received nicotine (2 mg/kg/day) through osmotic minipumps from the first day of pregnancy up to the end of weaning. At 1, 30, 60 and 90 days post-partum (dpp) the plasma cholesterol and testosterone levels were obtained, as well as the biometric, histopathological and <b>stereological</b> testicular <b>parameters.</b> Nicotine reduced the body weight, cholesterol levels and lipid droplet number in foetal LC at 1 dpp. the number of apoptotic LC did not change in the offspring of nicotine group at any age studied. No alterations in the numerical densities of MO and LC occurred at 60 and 90 dpp. Hypertrophy of mature LC and increase in cholesterol and testosterone levels were noted at 90 dpp. in conclusion, nicotine when administered to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation induces morphofunctional alterations of foetal and mature LC and affects cholesterol and testosterone levels.

A thin slab is prepared without mechanically disturbing weak layers or hard inclusions by using a tool with a heated wire as a cutter. The contrast is given by the sunlight from {{the back side of}} the profile. It is not falsified by damaged snow layers or an uneven distribution of the colour. Critical layers are easily detected, documented and investigated on site and samples for a micro analysis can be taken from the lateral walls.

Surface hoar, boundaries due to wind action and melted horizons are then subjected to a more thorough investigation by an analysis of thin sections or serial cuts.

40|$|The {{motivation}} for this thesis was in investigating the heritability of brain structure changes {{that may be}} useful in simplifying complicated genetic studies in epilepsy. An essential step in realizing this goal is the establishment of reliable and robust tools forautomated MRI-based in-vivo segmentation and measurement of geometric properties of brain structures. A reliable automated technique is necessary for future large scale genetic studies, where large amounts of data are needed to be produced efficiently, where manual methods are simply not practical. For this reason, this thesis focuses on investigating the optimisation, validity and reliability of Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (QMRI) techniques for the measurement of geometric properties of brain structures. In this thesis it is proposed to use the mathematically unbiased manual technique of stereology to validate the brain structure volumes produced by an automated method. In this work, the impact of object shape on the efficiency of MRI-based stereological sampling is firstly investigated for volume estimation and recommendations are then made for the optimal sampling of 4 varying shaped brain structures; cerebral white matter, temporal lobe, hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Using these optimal <b>parameters,</b> <b>stereological</b> estimates are further examined to determine accuracy, repeatability and reliability of the manual volume estimates, before being compared with volumes obtained from the automated method, FreeSurfer. Results from this validation of the automated segmentation procedure demonstrated Freesurfer to be a reliable technique for hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volume measurements when compared with manual b a d stereology. This automated method was then applied to investigate potential MRI-based brain structure in patients with clinically defined temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). A number of sub cortical structural volumes and cortical based volumes and thicknesses were examined and results demonstrated a reduction of volume in cerebral white matter, hippocampus, thalamus, mesial temporal cortex and left entorhinal cortex. A preliminary study was then carried out to investigate the heritability and, hence, endophenotypic potential of these identified abnormalities in a cohort of TLE patients, their unaffected siblings and control subjects. Our findings suggest a significant decrease in cerebral white matter and left entorhinal cortex common to patients and their non-affected siblings and a significant relationship between sibling pairs of thalamus volume, suggesting that structural volume changes in TLE patients may contain a heritable factor...|$|R

Hyperoxia-exposed 2 -wk rats showed significant changes only in total number of alveoli, mean alveolar volume, and lacunarity with respect to equal-in-age normoxic rats. In the comparison between 6 -wk rats, the hyperoxia-exposed group showed decreased D and increased lacunarity, together with changes in all <b>stereological</b> <b>parameters</b> except for septal thickness. Analysis of receiver operating characteristic curves showed a comparable discriminatory power of D, lacunarity, and total number of alveoli; Lm and mean alveolar volume were less discriminative. D and lacunarity did not show significant changes when different segmentation thresholds were applied, suggesting that the fractal approach may be fit to automatic image analysis...|$|E
