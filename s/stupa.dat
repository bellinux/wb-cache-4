5|$|A {{centre of}} Buddhist {{learning}} and culture, Gangtok's most notable Buddhist institutions are the Enchey monastery, the Do-drul Chorten <b>stupa</b> complex and the Rumtek Monastery. The Enchey monastery is the city's oldest monastery {{and is the}} seat of the Nyingma order. The two-hundred-year-old baroque monastery houses images of gods, goddesses, and other religious artifacts. In the month of January, the Chaam, or masked dance, is performed with great fanfare. The Dro-dul Chorten is a <b>stupa</b> which was constructed in 1945 by Trulshik Rimpoché, head of the Nyingma order of Tibetan Buddhism. Inside this <b>stupa</b> are complete set of relics, holy books, and mantras. Surrounding the edifice are 108 Mani Lhakor, or prayer wheels. The complex also houses a religious school.|$|E
5|$|The two hills are {{connected}} by a walkway. The eastern hill is also called the <b>Stupa</b> hill, while the western hill is called the Canon hill, reflecting their historic colonial era names, the ancient <b>Stupa</b> and the Portuguese era firing Canons they host respectively.|$|E
5|$|Hartmann, a Dutch {{administrator}} of the Kedu region, continued Cornelius's work, and in 1835, the whole complex was finally unearthed. His interest in Borobudur was more personal than official. Hartmann did not write any reports of his activities, in particular, the alleged story that he discovered the large statue of Buddha in the main <b>stupa.</b> In 1842, Hartmann investigated the main dome, although what he discovered is unknown and the main <b>stupa</b> remains empty.|$|E
50|$|The {{construction}} of <b>stupas</b> were considered acts of great merit. The purpose of <b>stupas</b> were mainly to enshrine relics of Buddha. The design specifications are consistent within {{most of the}} <b>stupas,</b> entrances to <b>stupas</b> are laid out so that their centre lines point to the relic chambers.|$|R
5000|$|Double <b>Stupas</b> - Two {{sandstone}} <b>stupas,</b> or [...] "phra that", cube-shaped with round tops, are west of Mo E-Dang cliff. The <b>stupas</b> house {{items that}} indicate {{the prosperity of}} the Khmer period.|$|R

5|$|Next, {{along the}} face of the eastern hill to the north of Sitabai's cave is another small Hindu {{excavation}} with a veranda, which was probably to be three cells, but was abandoned following the discovery of a flaw in the rock. Past the 7th cave, to the east of hill is a dry pond, with large artificial boulders and Buddhist cisterns along its banks. At the end of the north spur of the main hill is a mound that resembles a Buddhist <b>stupa.</b> This, states Michell and Dhavalikar, may be the remains of a much higher Buddhist <b>stupa</b> from about 2nd century BCE.|$|E
5|$|The {{second phase}} of the temple was {{completed}} in late 2008, featuring a new Main Ksitigarbha Prayer Hall as well as a Guanyin Meditation Hall with lapis lazuli statues and a 7-storey <b>stupa.</b>|$|E
5|$|Borobudur differs {{markedly}} {{from the}} general design of other structures built for this purpose. Instead of being built on a flat surface, Borobudur is built on a natural hill. However, construction technique is similar to other temples in Java. Without the inner spaces seen in other temples, and with a general design similar {{to the shape of}} pyramid, Borobudur was first thought more likely to have served as a <b>stupa,</b> instead of a temple. A <b>stupa</b> is intended as a shrine for the Buddha. Sometimes stupas were built only as devotional symbols of Buddhism. A temple, on the other hand, is used as a house of worship. The meticulous complexity of the monument's design suggests that Borobudur is in fact a temple.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Stupas</b> {{originated}} as pre-Buddhist tumuli {{in which}} śramaṇas {{were buried in}} a seated position called chaitya. After the parinirvana of the Buddha, his remains were cremated and the ashes divided and buried under eight mounds with two further mounds encasing the urn and the embers. The earliest archaeological evidence {{for the presence of}} Buddhist <b>stupas</b> dates to the late 4th century BCE in India. Buddhist scriptures claim that <b>stupas</b> were built at least a century earlier. Since it is likely that before this time <b>stupas</b> were built with non-durable materials such as wood, or that they were merely burial mounds, little is known about them, particularly since it has not been possible to identify the original ten monuments. [...] However, some later <b>stupas,</b> such as at Sarnath and Sanchi, seem to be embellishments of earlier mounds. The earliest evidence of monastic <b>stupas</b> dates back to the 2nd century BCE. These are <b>stupas</b> that were built within Buddhist monastic complexes and they replicate in stone older <b>stupas</b> made of baked bricks and timber. Sanchi, Sarnath, Amaravati and Bharhut are examples of <b>stupas</b> that were shaped in stone imitating previously existing wooden parts.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} <b>stupas</b> in the precincts {{of the temple}} complex of which four have {{paintings}} in its interior. Two of the <b>stupas</b> are dated to the 13th century, based on the paintings. A carved wooden lintel was also found {{in one of the}} <b>stupas.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Twin <b>Stupas.</b> The Twin <b>Stupas</b> are two red {{sandstone}} structures, 1.93 m. {{square and}} 4.20 m. high, with lotus-bud-shaped apices.|$|R
5|$|Built for the {{protection}} of a small <b>stupa,</b> the structure has two stone platforms decorated with elaborate stone carvings. The lower platform is entered through a single entrance facing the north, while the second platform can be accessed through four doorways facing the four cardinal points. The upper platform, surrounded by a brick wall, contains the <b>stupa.</b> Four Buddha statues are seated around it, each facing one of the entrances. Three concentric rows of stone columns had also been positioned here, presumably to support a wooden roof. The entire structure is decorated with stone carvings. Some of the carvings at the Polonnaruwa Vatadage, such as its sandakada pahanas, are considered to be the best examples of such architectural features. Although some archaeologists have suggested that it also had a wooden roof, this theory is disputed by others.|$|E
5|$|Flash floods {{resulting}} from glacial lake outburst flooding {{in the upper}} reaches of the valley, are a common occurrence in the Mo Chu and Pho Chu rivers, and in the past caused flooding and damage to the dzong, especially in 1957, 1960 and 1994. Fires and earthquakes have also further added to the problem. In 1996, flash floods in the Pho Chu river damaged the large <b>stupa</b> and caused several deaths.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} recorded Chortens are the Great Chorten and the Small Chorten (<b>stupa)</b> to {{the early}} 13th century, following {{the building of the}} Sumtseg. These chortens are decorated gateways known locally as 'Kakani Chörten' and 'Ka-ka-ni mchod-rten' that are considered unique to Alchi with historical link to other monuments. More chortens were added between the 13th and 14th centuries. In the Alchi complex, there are also three other chortens, which have ancient paintings.|$|E
5000|$|The One Hundred and Eight <b>Stupas</b> (...) is {{an array}} of one hundred and eight Buddhist <b>stupas</b> (also called dagobas) on a {{hillside}} {{on the west bank}} of the Yellow River at Qingtongxia in Ningxia, China. The <b>stupas</b> were originally constructed during the Western Xia, but have been renovated and rebuilt several times over the centuries.|$|R
50|$|Sand {{is brought}} to the temple grounds and is made into <b>stupas</b> or mounds, then {{decorated}} before being given to the monks {{as a way of}} making merit. There are two ways to make the sand <b>stupas.</b> One way is to go to the beach, and the other way is to bring sand to the vat, or temple. Sand <b>stupas</b> are decorated with flags, flowers, white lines, and splashed with perfumed water. Sand <b>stupas</b> symbolize the mountain, Phoukhao Kailat, where King Kabinlaphrôm's head was kept by his seven daughters.|$|R
50|$|The Four Noble Truths <b>Stupas,</b> erected at {{the four}} corners of the Main Hall, are testaments to the first {{teaching}} that the Buddha gave following his enlightenment. The Four Noble Truths <b>Stupas</b> are dedicated in correspondence to the Four Great Bodhisattvas: Avalokitesvara, Ksitigarbha, Manjusri, and Samantabhadra. Offerings of incense, flowers, and light can be made to the Bodhisattvas at these <b>stupas.</b>|$|R
5|$|While {{developing}} the story, {{members of the}} Studios confronted Hergé with concerns about elements of Tintin in Tibet. Bob de Moor feared the scene in which Haddock crashes into a <b>stupa</b> was disrespectful to Buddhists. Jacques van Melkebeke suggested that the Yeti not be depicted {{to create a sense}} of enigma; Hergé disagreed, believing that it would disappoint his child readers.|$|E
5|$|Across {{the top of}} {{the ravine}} from Cave 1 on the other <b>Stupa</b> hill is a large hall known as Sitabai's temple cave. The portico has four pillars and two pilasters. The hall has 3 {{chambers}} at the back, the central one a shrine and the rest for monks or priests. The door of the central shrine has pilasters and a frieze, with the threshold decorated with lion figures. The sanctum has no image now, but is similar to Linga shrine on the island.|$|E
5|$|The {{brick wall}} around the {{platform}} is in a considerably preserved state as well, although parts of it have broken off. It is quite thickand was presumably constructed to protect the <b>stupa</b> from the sides. There is evidence that inner surface of the wall had been adorned with paintings. Its lower portion is covered by stone panels with carvings of a flower design. Below the wall, {{the side of the}} upper platform itself is decorated with carvings, as is the side of the lower platform.|$|E
50|$|The relics {{were later}} dug up by Ashoka, {{and used the}} relics (said to have been divided into 84,000 portions) and had <b>stupas</b> built over them {{throughout}} the region he rules. Many of the remains were taken to other countries. The Ashokavadana narrates how Ashoka redistributed Buddha's relics across 84,000 <b>stupas,</b> with {{the distribution of the}} relics and construction of the <b>stupas</b> performed by Yakshas.|$|R
5000|$|Sanchi is {{the center}} of a region with a number of <b>stupas</b> {{including}} Satdhara (17 km from Sanchi, 40 <b>stupas,</b> the Relics of Sariputra and Mahamoggallana, now enshrined in the new Vihara, were unearthed there), Morel Khurd (on a fortified hilltop with 60 <b>stupas),</b> Andher (17 km NE of Vidisha), Mawas, Sonari etc. all within a few miles of Sanchi.

25|$|<b>Stupas</b> in Tibet and Bhutan {{are usually}} called chorten in English, {{reflecting}} {{the term in}} the Tibetan language. There are eight different kinds of <b>stupas</b> in Tibetan Buddhism, each referring to major events in the Buddha's life.|$|R
5|$|The four Buddha statues, which {{depict the}} Dhyana mudra, are also carved from solid rock. Two {{of them are}} more or less intact today, while only parts of the other two remain. The <b>stupa</b> in the middle appears to have been of the Bubbulakara (bubble shaped) design {{commonly}} seen in Sri Lanka. The upper part has been destroyed, and only the dome shaped lower part now remains. However, it has only two Pesavas (the rings found at the base of stupas) rather than the traditional three.|$|E
5|$|According to the Samyutta Nikaya, Koṇḍañña {{retired to}} {{the banks of the}} Mandakini Lake in the Chaddanta forest, said to be the abode of the paccekabuddhas. It was said that the 8000 {{elephants}} in the forest took turns to catering for his needs. Koṇḍañña only left once, to farewell Gautama Buddha. Koṇḍañña kissed the Buddha's feet and stroked them with his hands. He advised his disciples not to mourn him before returning to the forest to pass away the following morning. He was cremated on a large sandalwood pyre which was constructed {{with the help of the}} elephants, and the ceremony was presided over by Anuruddha, one of the ten chief disciples and five hundred other monks. The ashes were later taken to Veluvana, where they were enshrined in a silver <b>stupa.</b>|$|E
5|$|The oldest part of {{the temple}} was built in 652 by Songtsen Gampo. To find a {{location}} for the temple, the king reportedly tossed his hat (a ring in another version) ahead of him with a promise to build a temple where the hat landed. It landed in a lake, where a white <b>stupa</b> (memorial monument) suddenly emerged over which the temple was built. In another version of the legend, Queen Bhrikuti founded the temple to install the statue she had brought and Queen Wencheng selected the site according to Chinese geomancy and feng shui. The lake was filled, leaving a small pond now visible as a well fed by the ancient lake, and a temple {{was built on the}} filled area. Over the next nine centuries, the temple was enlarged; its last renovation was carried out in 1610 by the Fifth Dalai Lama.|$|E
50|$|At Nandan Garh {{there are}} also Baudh (Buddha) <b>stupas</b> made out of bricks and about 80 ft high which {{according}} to the authoritative source are Ashoka <b>Stupas,</b> in which ashes of Lord Buddha’s funeral pyre are enshrined.|$|R
50|$|Lao <b>stupas</b> {{also have}} a {{distinct}} character, with That Luang being the most recognizable example, but would also include the That Phanom in Isan, Thailand, That Dam in Vientiane, and That Sikhottabong (That Ing Hang) in Thakhek. Lao <b>stupas</b> are characterized by a pyramidal base with an upward sloping spire which is elongated to represent a closed lotus blossom. The <b>stupas</b> are significant Buddhist sites of pilgrimage and are customarily built over important religious relics.|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} Qing dynasty the <b>stupas</b> {{underwent}} a major renovation, and the dilapidated mud <b>stupas</b> were encased in brick to protect them. The brick casing was thinly coated with white plaster several times {{up to the}} 1980s.|$|R
5|$|The {{restoration}} {{then was}} carried out between 1907 and 1911, using the principles of anastylosis and led by Theodor van Erp. The first seven months of restoration were occupied with excavating the grounds around the monument to find missing Buddha heads and panel stones. Van Erp dismantled and rebuilt the upper three circular platforms and stupas. Along the way, Van Erp discovered more things {{he could do to}} improve the monument; he submitted another proposal, which was approved with the additional cost of 34,600 guilders. At first glance, Borobudur had been restored to its old glory. Van Erp went further by carefully reconstructing the chhatra (three-tiered parasol) pinnacle on top of the main <b>stupa.</b> However, he later dismantled the chhatra, citing that there were not enough original stones used in reconstructing the pinnacle, which means that the original design of Borobudur's pinnacle is actually unknown. The dismantled chhatra now is stored in Karmawibhangga Museum, a few hundred meters north from Borobudur.|$|E
5|$|The spire can {{be divided}} into three sections. The lower section, which is the base, is formed of seven {{superimposed}} layers, each layer representing a level of heaven in accordance with the Traiphum Buddhist cosmology. The middle section is {{in the shape of a}} bell; however the roundness has been flattened to create a four sided shape. This represents the <b>stupa</b> in which the Buddha's ashes have been interred. The top section is similar to the top of chedis, depicting a tapered lotus bud or the crystal dew drop signifying the escape from the Saṃsāra or cycle of rebirths. The spire is supported by garudas on its four sides; as well as being the symbol of kingship, the garuda represents the mythical creatures of the Himavanta forest surrounding Mount Meru.|$|E
5|$|UNESCO {{identified}} three {{specific areas of}} concern under {{the present state of}} conservation: (i) vandalism by visitors; (ii) soil erosion in the south-eastern part of the site; and (iii) analysis and restoration of missing elements. The soft soil, the numerous earthquakes and heavy rains lead to the destabilization of the structure. Earthquakes are by far the most important contributing factors, since not only do stones fall down and arches crumble, but the earth itself can move in waves, further destroying the structure. The increasing popularity of the <b>stupa</b> brings in many visitors, most of whom are from Indonesia. Despite warning signs on all levels not to touch anything, the regular transmission of warnings over loudspeakers and the presence of guards, vandalism on reliefs and statues is a common occurrence and problem, leading to further deterioration. As of 2009, there is no system in place {{to limit the number of}} visitors allowed per day or to introduce mandatory guided tours only.|$|E
50|$|Deorkothar (Devanāgarī: देउर कोठार, also Deur Kothar) is a {{location}} of archaeological importance in Madhya Pradesh, Central India. It {{is known for}} its Buddhist <b>stupas</b> and was discovered in 1982.These <b>stupas</b> are credited to the Mauryan emperor, Ashoka.|$|R
