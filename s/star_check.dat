40|$|This thesis aims {{to study}} how {{amending}} certain astrophysical observable of quark stars due to presence of magnetic field. To do this we need to obtain Equation of State (EOS) and consider the stability of Strange Quark Matter (made up of quarks u, d and s) cold dense and magnetized in stellar equilibrium (beta equilibrium, conservation of the baryonic number and charge neutrality). We will work using the phenomenological MIT Bag model. The stability of the Magnetized Strange Quark Matter (MSQM) is studied {{taking into account the}} variation of parameters from the model: s quark mass, baryonic density, magnetic field and the Bag parameter. Results obtained were compared with those of magnetized normal quark matter (only u and d quarks in beta equilibrium) as well as the Strange Quark Matter (SQM). It is found that the energy per baryon decreases with the increasing magnetic field which implies that the MSQM is more stable than SQM.

Results: X-ray emission from MP Mus originates from high density cool plasma but a hot flaring component is also present, suggesting that both coronal magnetic activity and accretion contribute to the observed X-ray emission. We find a Ne/O ratio similar to that observed in the much younger classical T Tauri star BP Tau.

This paper aims to carry out {{an investigation of the}} validity of the quasi-static approximation in the context of pulsating <b>stars.</b> We <b>check</b> the adequacy of a two-dimensional time-dependent model of a Cepheid-like variable with focus on its spectroscopic properties. With the radiation-hydrodynamics code CO 5 BOLD, we construct a two-dimensional time-dependent envelope model of a Cepheid with T_eff= 5600 K, g= 2. 0, solar metallicity, and a 2. 8 -day pulsation period. Subsequently, we perform extensive spectral syntheses of a set of artificial iron lines in local thermodynamic equilibrium. The set of lines allows us to systematically study effects of line strength, ionization stage, and excitation potential. We evaluate the microturbulent velocity, line asymmetry, projection factor, and Doppler shifts. The mean Doppler shift is non-zero and negative, - 1 km/s, after averaging over several full periods and lines. This residual line-of-sight velocity (related to the "K-term") is primarily caused by horizontal inhomogeneities, and consequently we interpret it as the familiar convective blueshift ubiquitously present in non-pulsating late-type stars. Limited statistics prevent firm conclusions on the line asymmetries. Our two-dimensional model provides a reasonably accurate representation of the spectroscopic properties of a short-period Cepheid-like variable star. Some properties are primarily controlled by convective inhomogeneities rather than by the Cepheid-defining pulsations...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{discoveries of}} extrasolar {{planetary}} systems around lower main-sequence {{stars such as}} tau Booe (HD 120136) has prompted further investigation into their stellar activity. A cursory analysis of tau Booe for cyclic chromospheric activity, based on its 30 -yr record of Ca 2 H and K fluxes obtained {{as part of the}} HK Project from Mount Wilson Observatory, finds an intermediate, sub-yearly period (approximately 117 d) in chromospheric activity in addition to, and separate from, both its rotation (3. 3 d) and long-term variability. As a persistent subyearly period in surface magnetic activity is unprecedented, we investigate this apparent anomaly further by examining chromospheric activity levels of other stars with similar mass, searching for variability in chromospheric activity with periods of less than one year, but longer than measured or predicted rotation. An examination of the time series of 40 mid-to-late F dwarfs yielded one other star for further analysis: alpha Com (HD 114378, P approximately 132 d). The variations for these two <b>stars</b> were <b>checked</b> for persistence and coherence. Based on these determinations, we eliminate the possibilities of rotation, long-term activity cycle, and the evolution of active regions as the cause of this variation in both stars.
