Wagnerian music, though confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at the first go-off but the music of Mercadante's Huguenots, Meyerbeer's Seven Last Words on the Cross and Mozart's Twelfth Mass he simply revelled in, the Gloria in that being, to his mind, the acme of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat. He infinitely preferred the sacred music {{of the catholic church}} to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or Bid me to live and i will live thy protestant to be. He also yielded to none in his admiration of Rossini's Stabat Mater, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers, in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable sensation, he might safely say, greatly adding to her other laureis and putting the others totally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers' church in upper Gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos, or virtuosi rather. There was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore. On the whole though favouring preferably light opera of the Don Giovanni description and Martha, a gem in its line, he had a penchant, though with only a <b>surface</b> <b>knowledge,</b> for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn. And talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites, he mentioned par excellence Lionel's air in Martha, M'appari, which, curiously enough, he had heard or overheard, to be more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from the lips of Stephen's respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat. Stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he didn't sing it but launched out into praises of Shakespeare's songs, at least of in or about that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near Gerard the herbalist, who anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus, an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom B. did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their dux and comes conceits and Byrd (William) who played the virginals, he said, in the Queen's chapel or anywhere else he found them and one Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull.|$|E

40|$|The {{presented}} thesis {{documents the}} investigation {{and development of the}} mathematical foundations for a novel knowledge-based system for surface texture (VitualSurf system). This {{is the first time that}} this type of novel knowledge-based system has been tried on <b>surface</b> texture <b>knowledge.</b> It is important to realize that <b>surface</b> texture <b>knowledge,</b> based on new generation Geometrical Product Specification (GPS) system, are considered to be too theoretical, abstract, complex and over-elaborate. Also it is not easy for industry to understand and implement them efficiently in a short time. The VirtualSurf has been developed to link surface function, specification through manufacture and verification, and provide a universal platform for engineers in industry, making it easier for them to understand and use the latest <b>surface</b> texture <b>knowledge.</b> The intelligent knowledge-base should be capable of incorporating knowledge from multiple sources (standards, books, experts, etc), adding new knowledge from these sources and still remain a coherent reliable system. In this research, an object-relationship data model is developed to represent <b>surface</b> texture <b>knowledge.</b> The object-relationship data model generalises the relational and object orientated data models. It has both the flexibility of structures for entities and also good mathematical foundations, based on category theory, that ensures the knowledge-base remains a coherent and reliable system as new knowledge is added. This prototype system leaves much potential for further work. Based on the framework and data models developed in this thesis, the system will be developed into implemental software, either acting as a good training tool for new and less experienced engineers or further connecting with other analysis software, CAD software (design), surface instrument software (measurement) etc, and finally applied in production industries.
