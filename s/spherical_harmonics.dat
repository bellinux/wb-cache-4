5|$|Tomb Raider: Underworld {{continued}} the plot line established in Legend. Crystal Dynamics used {{new technology to}} improve the character for seventh generation consoles, focusing on improving realism. The dirt accumulation and water cleansing mechanic from Legend was altered to be a real-time mechanic that can involve the entire game environment. To achieve a more natural appearance, the developers added <b>spherical</b> <b>harmonics</b> to provide indirect lighting to in-game objects like Lara Croft. Crystal Dynamics made the character model more complex and detailed than previous instalments, featuring more texture layers that determine the appearance of shadows and reflective light on it, and using skeletal animation to portray believable movement. The number of polygons in the model increased to 32,000. The developers enhanced Croft's facial model by {{increasing the number of}} polygons, bones used in the animation skeleton, and graphical shaders in the face to add more detail and expressive capabilities. The hair was created as a real-time cloth simulation to further add realism to its shape and movement. The developers kept Croft's hair tied back because they felt a real person would not want it flying around while performing dangerous manoeuvres. The character's body size was increased and breast size reduced to portray more realistic proportions.|$|E

30|$|This study {{demonstrated}} {{the utility of}} localized Slepian basis functions to model near-surface low-pass-filtered total intensity and selected CHAMP satellite vector magnetic anomalies over a 25 °-radius cap centered on Australia. Effective Slepian <b>spherical</b> <b>harmonic</b> coefficients were obtained by weighted least squares inversion of the multi-altitude data sets. Relative to global <b>spherical</b> <b>harmonic</b> models, far fewer Slepian <b>spherical</b> <b>harmonic</b> coefficients are needed for honoring the smaller wavelength properties of the localized observations. However, the Slepian coefficients {{also can be used}} to update the global <b>spherical</b> <b>harmonic</b> coefficients, and thus, Slepian modeling can be efficient for updating global <b>spherical</b> <b>harmonic</b> models with new data. This approach will be particularly effective for updating global <b>spherical</b> <b>harmonic</b> models for new satellite observations such as from the Swarm mission (e.g., Thébault et al. 2016; Olsen et al. 2016) and new aeromagnetic surveys such as in the Antarctic (e.g., Kim et al. 2013; Golynsky et al. 2013; von Frese et al. 2008), the oceans, and other large unsurveyed regions of the Earth.|$|R

Spectral forms of the non-linear rotating Boussinesq and anelastic momentum, magnetic field and heat equations are derived for spherical geometries from vector <b>spherical</b> <b>harmonic</b> expansions of the velocity, magnetic induction, vorticity, electrical current and gravitational acceleration, and from scalar <b>spherical</b> <b>harmonic</b> expansions of the pressure and temperature. Combining the vector <b>spherical</b> <b>harmonic</b> forms of the momentum equation and the magnetic induction equation with poloidal-toroidal representations of the velocity and the magnetic field, non-linear <b>spherical</b> <b>harmonic</b> spectral equations are also derived for the poloidal-toroidal potentials of the velocity, or the momentum density in the anelastic approximation, and the magnetic field.
