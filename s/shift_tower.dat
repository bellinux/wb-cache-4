5000|$|Blitz! {{opened in}} London 8 May 1962 at the Adelphi Theatre, while Bart's {{enormous}} West End success Oliver! was still running at the New Theatre; {{at that time}} Oliver! {{had not yet been}} produced on Broadway. Blitz ran for 568 performances. It never ran on Broadway: between its scale and the fact that New Yorkers could hardly be expected to share Londoners' nostalgia for the period, it proved [...] "unexportable". Bart wrote the music and lyrics, and had directed the original London production himself; Joan Maitland contributed to the libretto. Sean Kenny designed the elaborate sets, which included representations of Victoria Station, Petticoat Lane, and the Bank underground station, not to mention London on fire during an air raid. Four revolving house units and an enormous, mobile overhead bridge carried on two <b>shifting</b> <b>towers</b> made it, at the time, the most expensive West End musical ever produced. Noël Coward called it [...] "twice as loud and twice as long as the real thing." ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDriver {{sensation}} {{during a}} gearshift in a manual transmission {{is one of}} the most remarkable actions in terms of comfort perception in motor vehicles. This importance has increased in a reasonable way in the last years mainly because of higher quality requirements demanded by the market. All movements and efforts, mainly the so-called double bump, are directly transferred to the drive's hand thru the gearshift lever inside the vehicle and cables that make the connection of the lever with the <b>shifting</b> <b>tower.</b> Having said that, it is possible to verify in the available literature that no human interaction analysis with the gearshift system considering human factors and ergonomics (HFE) are used to define its relation to the physical values observed during the process of gearshifting (e. g. efforts, impulses, times, etc.) to support changes in the transmission hardware. Therefore, using a HFE approach for the gearshift system, this study analyzes the models of the available literature and check its considerations, and applying HFE concepts proposes a different approach to estimate human perception about shift comfort...|$|R

5000|$|The test {{took place}} on October 10, 1959. [...] For the test, steel cable was {{attached}} to each Tower and a crane was used to exert lateral force, all connected to a 'load-force' meter. The crane was unable to topple or even <b>shift</b> the <b>Towers</b> with the forces applied, and the test was concluded when the crane experienced mechanical failure. Bud Goldstone and Edward Farrell were the engineer and architect leading the team. The stress test registered 10,000 lbs. The Towers are anchored less than 2 ft in the ground, and have been highlighted in architectural textbooks, and have changed the way some structures are designed for stability and endurance.|$|R

50|$|The {{junction}} had an interlocking {{tower and}} turntable, but no station. The tower opened on December 20, 1911, {{four days before}} the Cut-Off itself. The small Slateford turntable saw limited use; it was dismantled in the 1930s and its pit filled in shortly thereafter. The tower closed on January 11, 1951; its operations were <b>shifted</b> to the <b>tower</b> at East Stroudsburg.|$|R
50|$|In 1995 Hurricane Opal {{washed away}} {{much of the}} sand around the <b>tower,</b> <b>shifted</b> it {{partially}} off its pilings and rotated it, leaving it leaning about 10° from vertical. In 1998 the tower was further damaged by Hurricane Georges. Supporters raised $50,000 locally and $160,000 from the state to correct the tilt. The tower was righted and a new foundation built under it in 2002. However, the base was still exposed to surf, and the new foundation began deteriorating. The tower collapsed on October 22, 2005.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{illustrates}} how different dynamic identification techniques {{can be used}} to justify the significant vibration phenomena observed in modern bell tower during the swinging motion of the bells. First, the modal model of the tower is extracted from the structure ambient vibration. The results obtained by two output-only identification techniques, working in the frequency (EFDD) and the time domain (SSI), are compared. Then the bell excitation is characterized from the steady-state of the tower forced response to the bell swinging motion. The resonance between the fundamental tower frequency and the third harmonic of the horizontal dynamic force applied to the structure by the swinging bells is clearly recognized as the source of large oscillations. A finite element model is developed and updated to properly reproduce the tower spectral properties. Aiming to mitigate the identified phenomenon, the model allows the design of a stiffening intervention to properly <b>shift</b> the <b>tower</b> resonant frequency. The effectiveness of the designed solution is successfully verified by a post-intervention dynamic test campaig...|$|R

5000|$|Jenkins {{describes}} {{the tower and}} spire thus:"The tower now rises free of the roofline of the aisles, with two tiers of blind arcading. Then come two stages of bell openings, one with two windows the next with just one, as if to increase the tension. The tower is carefully tapered, with lines accentuated by angle buttresses. Four pinnacles now effortlessly conceal the <b>shift</b> from square <b>tower</b> into octagonal spire, which rises from its small broaches in a single final thrust. The taper of the spire seems perfectly judged, with its ribs and three tiers of diminishing lucarnes covered in ballflower, as if infested with golden snails. Grantham's tower ranks with any masterpiece of English art. Such was the effect on Ruskin that he (allegedly) swooned on first seeing it." ...|$|R
50|$|The Ipswich Range Lights are a pair {{of range}} lights on Crane Beach in Ipswich, Massachusetts. They have a long and varied story. They were first built as two brick towers, 542 ft apart on {{a more or less}} east-west line in 1838. The {{movement}} of the sands led to <b>shifting</b> of the <b>towers</b> and by 1881 the rear tower, Ipswich Rear Range Light, was badly cracked. It was replaced by a cast-iron tower, while by 1867 the front light, Ipswich Front Range Light, had been replaced by a movable wood structure that could be shifted as the channel shifted. The front light was discontinued in 1932 and the rear light was replaced in 1938 with a skeleton tower. It, or its replacement, is still in service today. The 1881 cast-iron rear tower was loaded on a barge and shipped to Edgartown, Massachusetts, where it replaced the Edgartown Harbor Light that had been destroyed in the Hurricane of 1938.|$|R
50|$|The {{defence systems}} in Queensland were {{deemed to be}} lacking in {{cohesion}} and discipline, and a necessary reorganisation was soon established under the Queensland Defence Act 1884. It created a small permanent force {{as well as a}} partially paid militia force and voluntary infantry units, and set out new orders of battle and establishment. It also divided the colony into two Military Districts - Southern and Northern. On 24 February 1885 No 4 Battery was redesignated as the Townsville Garrison Battery in the Kennedy Division (KD) of the Northern Military Division (NMD). A number of volunteer companies, A through F, were formed in Townsville, Charters Towers and Ravenswood throughout the year. By June, when Queensland Premier Sir Samuel Walker Griffith toured the north and visited Townsville, the 64-pounder guns recommended by Scratchley in 1882 had been mounted at Kissing Point and Magazine Island and were fired. This entailed construction of a timber platform over which the gun carriage could move. The 10 acre site (about 4 hectares) where the battery was constructed was formally gazetted for Defence Purposes in 1886. Following reorganisation of the colony's regimental divisions, in October of the same year, the 3rd Queensland (Kennedy) Regiment was raised and headquartered in Townsville, subsuming the various Volunteer Independent Rifle Companies listed above. It received its colours in 1887 when its headquarters were <b>shifted</b> to Charters <b>Towers.</b>|$|R
60|$|From {{a broken}} stair-like base, washed, as {{the steps of}} a water-palace, by the waves, the tower rose in entablatures of strata to a shaven summit. These uniform layers, which compose the mass, form its most {{peculiar}} feature. For at their lines of junction they project flatly into encircling shelves, from top to bottom, rising one above another in graduated series. And as the eaves of any old barn or abbey are alive with swallows, so were all these rocky ledges with unnumbered sea-fowl. Eaves upon eaves, and nests upon nests. Here and there were long birdlime streaks of a ghostly white staining the tower from sea to air, readily accounting for its sail-like look afar. All would have been bewitchingly quiescent, {{were it not for}} the demoniac din created by the birds. Not only were the eaves rustling with them, but they flew densely overhead, spreading themselves into a winged and continually <b>shifting</b> canopy. The <b>tower</b> is the resort of aquatic birds for hundreds of leagues around. To the north, to the east, to the west, stretches nothing but eternal ocean; so that the man-of-war hawk coming from the coasts of North America, Polynesia, or Peru, makes his first land at Rodondo. And yet though Rodondo be terra-firma, no land-bird ever lighted on it. Fancy a red-robin or a canary there! What a falling into the hands of the Philistines, when the poor warbler should be surrounded by such locust-flights of strong bandit birds, with long bills cruel as daggers.|$|R
6000|$|There is no {{sight in}} any country that raises my own spirits {{so much as a}} {{scaffolding}}. It is a tragedy that they always take the scaffolding away, and leave us nothing but a mere building. If they would only take the building away and leave us a beautiful scaffolding, it would in most cases be a gain to the loveliness of earth. If I could analyse what it is that lifts the heart about the lightness and clarity of such a white and wooden skeleton, I could explain what it is that is really charming about New York; in spite of its suffering from the curse of cosmopolitanism and even the provincial superstition of progress. It is partly that all this destruction and reconstruction is an unexhausted artistic energy; but it is partly also that it is an artistic energy that does not take itself too seriously. It is first because man is here a carpenter; and secondly because he is a stage carpenter. Indeed there is about the whole scene the spirit of scene-shifting. It therefore touches whatever nerve in us has since childhood thrilled at all theatrical things. But the picture will be imperfect unless we realise something which gives it unity and marks its chief difference from the climate and colours of Western Europe. We may say that the back-scene remains the same. The sky remained, and in the depths of winter it seemed to be blue with summer; and so clear that I almost flattered myself that clouds were English products like primroses. An American would probably retort on my charge of scene-shifting by saying that at least he only <b>shifted</b> the <b>towers</b> and domes of the earth; and that in England it is the heavens that are shifty. And indeed we have changes from day to day that would seem to him as distinct as different magic-lantern slides; one view showing the Bay of Naples and the next the North Pole. I do not mean, of course, that there are no changes in American weather; but as a matter of proportion {{it is true that the}} most unstable part of our scenery is the most stable part of theirs. Indeed we might almost be pardoned the boast that Britain alone really possesses the noble thing called weather; most other countries having to be content with climate. It must be confessed, however, that they often are content with it. And the beauty of New York, which is considerable, is very largely due to the clarity that brings out the colours of varied buildings against the equal colour of the sky. Strangely enough I found myself repeating about this vista of the West two vivid lines in which Mr. W. B. Yeats has called up a vision of the East:-- ...|$|R
5000|$|During the Ming dynasty, troops under {{permanent}} encampment in {{and around}} Beijing were called Jingjun or Jingying ("capital troops"). During the Yongle era (1402-1424), they were organised into three groups, called Wujunying (consisting {{of the majority of}} the army), Sanqianying (consisting of mercenary and allied Mongol troops), and Shenjiying (consisting of troops using firearms). The three ying were further divided into 72 wei, organised into five groups named Zhongjun (centre), Zuoyejun (left middle), Youyejun (right middle), Zuoshaojun (left guard), and Youshaojun (right guard); these were collectively known as the Wujunying ("five troops"). The majority of the Jingjun were headquartered outside of west Deshengguan. Some camped in the rural districts of the capital area, at Nanyuan, Tonzhou, Lugouqiao, Changping, and the Juyongguan interior Great Wall. During the Tumu Crisis in 1449, the entire Jingjun was destroyed, a loss of some 500,000 men. Yu Qian then changed the organisational structure of the force, bringing approximately 100,000 well-trained troops from several different camps into one supergroup: the 10-battalion supergroup. This was raised to 12 battalions during the reign of Emperor Xian of the Ming dynasty. These were commanded from within the Inner city at Dongguanting and Xiguanting. Drilling and training fields outside of the city walls could also be used as temporary encampments. The original Wujunying, Sanqianying, and Shenjiying were converted to guard units in charge of protecting the Imperial city and the Forbidden city. Later the Imperial guards were joined by the Jinyiwei and the Tengxiangwei, whose commanders included [...] "Mianyiwei Dahan General", [...] "Hongkui General", [...] "Mingjia General", [...] "Bazong Director", and several others. A guard post in the Imperial city called [...] "Hongpu" [...] was formed. The city gates were closed at night; no one was allowed in or out unless special permission was given (one exception was the carts that continually brought spring water from Mount Yuquan). The city streets had guards on constant patrol at night. Loud and disruptive behaviour was forbidden. Some streets had barricades erected at night to keep traffic away. The city walls normally had no soldiers on station, day or night. Most lived under the walls in encampments, with a few doing night <b>shifts</b> at gate <b>towers,</b> watchtowers, and enemy sight towers. Only when there was danger of enemy attack were soldiers stationed atop the city walls. During the Ming dynasty, Beijing was often under siege by Mongol and Manchu forces. The city of Beijing was totally closed many times, with commoners forbidden entrance into the city.|$|R
