Among the 31 provinces in China (not {{including}} Taiwan, Hongkong and Macao, the same hereafter), the smallest sample numbers are less than 3000 (Jiangxi 2608, Tianjin 2818, and Hainan 2829).

30|$|Woody {{cover in}} the KNP {{has been shown to}} vary {{depending}} on topographic position, with the valleys having more woody cover (Gertenbach 1983). The topographic location of the field <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> was, therefore, purposefully varied in order to represent woody cover in valley, crest and mid-slope positions. Therefore, purposive sampling was employed in the field, with the goal of representing these topographic positions in the sample data. The overall layout of the <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> at each of the study sites approximated linear transects. Logistics and the time-consuming nature of the field work limited the total number of <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> and necessitated separate fieldwork excursions to the study sites during 2013 and 2014.

40|$|Earth surface {{systems are}} {{controlled}} {{by a combination of}} global and local factors, which cannot be understood without accounting for both the local and global components. The system dynamics cannot be recovered from the global or local controls alone. Ground forest inventory is able to accurately estimate forest carbon stocks at <b>sample</b> <b>plots,</b> but these <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> are too sparse to support the spatial simulation of carbon stocks with required accuracy. Satellite observation is an important source of global information for the simulation of carbon stocks. Satellite remote-sensing can supply spatially continuous information about the surface of forest carbon stocks, which is impossible from ground-based investigations, but their description has considerable uncertainty. In this paper, we validated the Lund-Potsdam-Jena dynamic global vegetation model (LPJ), the Kriging method for spatial interpolation of ground <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> and a satellite-observation-based approach as well as an approach for fusing the ground <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> with satellite observations and an assimilation method for incorporating the ground <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> into LPJ. The validation results indicated that both the data fusion and data assimilation approaches reduced the uncertainty of estimating carbon stocks. The data fusion had the lowest uncertainty by using an existing method for high accuracy surface modeling to fuse the ground <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> with the satellite observations (HASM-SOA). The estimates produced with HASM-SOA were 26. 1 and 28. 4 % more accurate than the satellite-based approach and spatial interpolation of the <b>sample</b> <b>plots,</b> respectively. Forest carbon stocks of 7. 08 Pg were estimated for China during the period from 2004 to 2008, an increase of 2. 24 Pg from 1984 to 2008, using the preferred HASM-SOA method...|$|R
50|$|Soil bulk density, pore-size distribution, water {{permeability}} and {{the relative}} apparent gas diffusion coefficient give a good overview of the permeability of soils to air and water and therefore {{on the degree of}} compaction. Since the coarse pores are most important for water infiltration, gas exchange and transport, focusing on them when measuring the porosity and the diffusion coefficient is recommended. Data gained at a laboratory are reliable as long as a certain amount of samples has been analyzed.

30|$|Within each site, 30 center {{points were}} located along transects running {{perpendicular}} to the long axis of each site. Four circular <b>sampling</b> <b>plots</b> (0.89 m 2 each) were established at 90 ° angles 7.1 meters around each center point, two along each transect {{and the other two}} {{perpendicular to the}} transects. For each sampling year (1972, 1974, 1980, 2003, 2004), two <b>sampling</b> <b>plots</b> were randomly selected for sampling. Midsummer of each sampling year, the herbaceous stems within the selected <b>sampling</b> <b>plots</b> were identified to species, counted, clipped and dried to determine biomass production. The mean of the two <b>sampling</b> <b>plots</b> was used in the analyses. In the earlier published manuscripts (Oswald and Covington 1983, Oswald and Covington 1984), Analysis of Variance (p= 0.05) was used to test the effect of passage of time (1972 to 1980) and severity of burn on biomass production. The Student-Newman-Kuels Multiple Range test was used to test differences. The relatively large number of N’s within each site allowed for statistical analysis even though treatments (burn severities) were not replicated.|$|R
