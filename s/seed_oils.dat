25|$|Although {{the best}} source of ALA is seeds, most seeds and <b>seed</b> <b>oils</b> are much richer in an n−6 fatty acid, {{linoleic}} acid. Exceptions include flaxseed (must be ground for proper nutrient absorption) and chia seeds. Linoleic acid is the other essential fatty acid, but it, and the other n−6 fatty acids, compete with n−3s for positions in cell membranes and have very different effects on human health.

25|$|<b>Seed</b> <b>oils</b> are {{the richest}} sources of α-linolenic acid, notably those of chia, perilla, {{flaxseed}} (linseed oil), rapeseed (canola), and soybeans. α-Linolenic acid is also {{obtained from the}} thylakoid membranes in the leaves of Pisum sativum (pea leaves). Plant chloroplasts consisting of more than 95 percent of photosynthetic thylakoid membranes are highly fluid due to large abundance of linolenic acid, that shows up as sharp resonances in high resolution carbon-13 NMR spectra, invariably. Some studies state that ALA remains stable during processing and cooking. However, other studies state that ALA might not be suitable for baking, as it will polymerize with itself, a feature exploited in paint with transition metal catalysts. Some ALA may also oxidize at baking temperatures. ALA percentages in the table below refer to the oils extracted from each item.|$|E

The aim {{of the study was}} to analyze natural cold pressed oils as potential cosmetic products. Material and methods. Cold pressed oils obtained from selected seeds and fruit stones were analyzed, including: chokeberry <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> blackcurrant <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> elderberry <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> raspberry <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> apricot <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> tomato <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> strawberry <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> broccoli <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> Nigella sativa <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> hemp <b>oil,</b> safflower <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> Silybum marianum <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> and coconut oil. 80 adult volunteers assessed the cosmetic properties of the analyzed oils. Each of the volunteers tested 2 to 4 different oils, by applying them on the skin. In addition, patch tests with all analyzed oils were performed on 23 individuals. Results. The majority of tested oils were positively evaluated by the participants: in the opinion of the participants, oil extracted from safflower had the best appearance (100 % positive opinions), coconut oil had the best smell (70 % positive opinions), while black currant <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> showed the best absorbency (85 % positive opinions).
