5|$|After the Hessians {{entered the}} fort, the American {{officers}} attempted to placate the Hessian commander, Captain von Malmburg, {{who was in}} charge of the surrender. They invited him into their barracks, and offered him punch, wine, cake, with compliments. As they left the fort, the Hessians <b>stripped</b> <b>the</b> American troops of their baggage and beat some of them. Their officers intervened to prevent further injuries or deaths. The British captured thirty-four cannons, two howitzers, along with many tents, blankets, tools and much ammunition.|$|E
5|$|After the Nazi {{seizure of}} power in 1933, Hess was {{appointed}} Deputy Führer of the NSDAP and received a post in Hitler's cabinet. He was the third {{most powerful man in}} Germany, behind only Hitler and Hermann Göring. In addition to appearing on Hitler's behalf at speaking engagements and rallies, Hess signed into law much of the legislation, including the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, which <b>stripped</b> <b>the</b> Jews of Germany of their rights in the lead-up to the Holocaust.|$|E
5|$|Anne's daughter, Margaret, married John Tufton, the Earl of Thanet. John's son, Thomas, <b>stripped</b> <b>the</b> castle around 1695 {{to support}} the {{reconstruction}} of Appleby Castle. The furnishings were sold in 1714 and in 1763 much of the stone from Clifford's Tower was plundered {{for use in the}} construction of Brough Mill; the castle was subsequently completely abandoned. The south-west corner of the keep partially collapsed around 1800.|$|E

The JTWC issued their final warning on the system at 00:00UTC that day accordingly. The JMA maintained {{the system as a}} tropical depression as the former typhoon began turning to the east. Uleki later transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September16 as it accelerated to the east. The system dissipated the following day near the International Dateline, far from any major landmasses.|$|E
5|$|However, over time, the {{cumulative}} {{probability of a}} chance encounter with a star increases, and disruption of the planets becomes all but inevitable. Assuming that the Big Crunch or Big Rip scenarios {{for the end of}} the Universe do not occur, calculations suggest that the gravity of passing stars will have completely <b>stripped</b> <b>the</b> dead Sun of its remaining planets within 1quadrillion (1015) years. This point marks the end of the Solar System. Although the Sun and planets may survive, the Solar System, in any meaningful sense, will cease to exist.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, the {{controversy}} was revived. Alerted to the incident, American Association for Cancer Research (AACR), which had established the Cornelius P.

He concluded {{there was no evidence}} of unethical human experimentation, but the letter was so offensive that the prize should be renamed. AACR concurred and <b>stripped</b> <b>the</b> honor from Rhoads because of his racism.|$|E

5|$|The Act {{succeeded in}} its initial aim of {{establishing}} a mental health care system for Alaska, funded by income from lands allocated to a mental health trust. However, during the 1970s and early 1980s, Alaskan politicians systematically <b>stripped</b> <b>the</b> trust of its lands, transferring the most valuable land to private individuals and state agencies. The asset stripping was eventually ruled to be illegal following several years of litigation, and a reconstituted mental health trust {{was established in the}} mid-1980s.|$|E
5|$|With the Byzantine {{forces at}} the Persian front having already {{suffered}} heavy casualties in previous confrontations, Domentziolus {{was unable to}} oppose the Sassanid raids during 605. There was also little chance of further reinforcements. Phocas had concluded peace treaties with the Lombards and Avars {{in an attempt to}} secure control of his provinces in the Italian Peninsula and the Balkans. He had already <b>stripped</b> <b>the</b> Balkans of most of their military forces, reassigning them to the Persian front. But this policy had backfired with the undermanned Balkans facing a Slavic invasion, notably endangering Thessalonica.|$|E
5|$|According to an {{official}} government press agency dispatch, {{about half of}} the candidates (approx. 360) were PZPR members. A majority of the remainder belonged to PZPR allies (Democratic Party (SD), United People's Party (ZSL)). There was no opposition party in Poland since all political groupings had to support the program of the PZPR. As a result, no real opposition candidates were permitted to run in the elections, but in theory the Polish voters could have <b>stripped</b> <b>the</b> communists from their claimed legitimacy by abstaining from voting. Another means of preventing the PZPR from obtaining a political victory would have occurred if all of the PZPR candidates were struck out, leaving only 100 to be elected.|$|E

5|$|As the {{blizzard}} progressed, Patrick Dolan began to rant deliriously, stripped off his clothes, {{and ran into}} the woods. He returned shortly afterwards and died a few hours later. Not long after, possibly because 12-year-old Lemuel Murphy was near death, some of the group began to eat flesh from Dolan's body. Lemuel's sister tried to feed some to her brother, but he died shortly afterwards. Eddy, Salvador, and Luis refused to eat. The next morning, the group <b>stripped</b> <b>the</b> muscle and organs from the bodies of Antonio, Dolan, Graves, and Murphy and dried it to store for the days ahead, taking care to ensure that nobody would have to eat his or her relatives.|$|E
5|$|At Oregon's request, the U.S. Congress <b>stripped</b> <b>the</b> slough of its navigable {{status in}} 1978. This ended channel {{dredging}} on the slough, which {{could then be}} used for recreation. Other laws affecting the slough in the 1970s and beyond were the federal Clean Water Act and the Oregon Comprehensive Land Use Planning Act. In 1986, a business association began promoting commercial development along the upper slough, and the city later used urban renewal funds to support industrial projects near the airport. In 1996 the city acquired the Whitaker Ponds Natural Area, where it began a slough watershed education program for children.|$|E
5|$|Following the eviction, Killakee House {{was briefly}} {{used as an}} {{operations}} base by the Detective Unit of the Garda Síochána in 1931 while they hunted IRA subversives who were hiding explosives at Killakee. When the bank {{was unable to find}} a buyer for the estate, it was acquired by a builder who <b>stripped</b> <b>the</b> house and then demolished it in 1941. The lands were eventually acquired by the State and opened to the public. In the late 1930s, the Director of Forestry, a German called Otto Reinhard, laid out the area as an urban forest. The trees have reclaimed most of the land once occupied by the formal gardens: all that remains is the brickwork {{at the rear of the}} Turner glasshouses and the system of irrigation canals and ponds for the exotic plants contained within.|$|E

5|$|In 1660 Charles II was {{restored}} to the throne and ownership of the castles changed once again. Beaumaris {{was restored}} to {{the control of the}} Bulkeley family, traditionally the constables of the castle, who promptly <b>stripped</b> <b>the</b> castle of any remaining materials, including the roofs, and Conwy was returned to the Conway family, who stripped down the castle for lead and timber, reducing it to a ruin as well. Charles' new government regarded Caernarfon's castle and town walls as a security risk and ordered them to be destroyed, but this order was never carried out, possibly because of the costs involved in doing so.|$|E
5|$|Most Sri Lankan Tamils {{live in the}} Northern and Eastern {{provinces and}} in the capital Colombo, and most Indian Tamils live in the central highlands. Historically, both groups have seen {{themselves}} as separate communities, {{although there has been}} a greater sense of unity since the 1980s. In 1948, the United National Party government <b>stripped</b> <b>the</b> Indian Tamils of their citizenship. Under the terms of an agreement reached between the Sri Lankan and Indian governments in the 1960s, about forty percent of the Indian Tamils were granted Sri Lankan citizenship, and most of the remainder were repatriated to India. By the 1990s, most Indian Tamils had received Sri Lankan citizenship.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{featured}} preliminary matches on the SmackDown brand was between The Undertaker and Edge for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship. At Backlash, the Undertaker defeated Edge {{to retain the}} title by forcing him {{to submit to the}} gogoplata, a chokehold move that causes opponents to spit blood (scripted) from their mouths. On the May 2 episode of SmackDown, authority figure Vickie Guerrero <b>stripped</b> <b>the</b> title from the Undertaker, after claiming the gogoplata was an illegal submission hold and she did it to protect the other wrestlers. The following week, Guerrero booked Undertaker in a match for the vacant title at Judgment Day against Edge, who last eliminated Batista in a battle royal, an elimination style match where the last person in the ring is the winner, to become the number one contender.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 16th century, the Lords was the {{stronger}} {{of the two}} houses of Parliament. A process of gradual developments combined with such moments of crisis as the English Civil Wars transferred the political control of England, first from the Crown to the House of Lords {{and then to the}} House of Commons. The rising wealth of the Commons eventually allowed it to wage two civil wars, dethrone two Kings, and gradually reduce the power of the Lords. Prior to the House of Lords Act 1999, the power of the Lords had been diminished by the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 which <b>stripped</b> <b>the</b> Lords of the ability to block, or veto, adoption of most bills; at most it could delay bills for one year. Furthermore, the Commons has absolute power when it comes to money bills.|$|E
5|$|Rising {{property}} prices in Surrey in the 1940s and 1950s made the LNC increasingly valuable, but {{also made it}} a target for property speculators. In 1959 a hostile takeover succeeded, and LNC's independence came to an end. From 1959 to 1985 a succession of owners <b>stripped</b> <b>the</b> profitable parts of the business from the company, leaving a rump residual company operating the increasingly derelict cemetery. In 1985 {{what remained of the}} company came into the ownership of Ramadan Güney, who set about reviving what remained. Links were formed with London's Muslim communities in an effort to encourage new burials, and a slow programme of clearing and restoring the derelict sections of the cemetery commenced. Although it was never as successful as planned, the LNC was very influential on both the funeral industry and the development of the area around Woking, and Brookwood Cemetery remains the largest cemetery in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The Danger Tree {{had been}} part of a clump of trees located about halfway into No Man's Land and had {{originally}} been used as a landmark by a Newfoundland Regiment trench raiding party {{in the days before the}} Battle of the Somme. British and German artillery bombardments eventually <b>stripped</b> <b>the</b> tree of leaves and left nothing more than a shattered tree trunk. During the Newfoundland Regiment's infantry assault, the tree was once again used as a landmark, where the troops were ordered to gather. The tree was however a highly visible landmark for the German artillery and the site proved to be a location where the German shrapnel was particularly deadly. As a result, the regiment suffered a large concentration of casualties around the tree. A replica representation of the twisted tree now stands at the spot.|$|E
