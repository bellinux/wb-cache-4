5|$|US-89 leaves Salt Lake City at exit 312 of I-15, {{where it}} acts as I-15's {{frontage}} roads. Just south of I-15's junction with I-215, US-89 splits to the northeast, passing through Bountiful and Woods Cross. A northerly curve onto 500 West removes the highway from Bountiful's Main Street, and it merges with I-15 at exit 317 to bypass Centerville and Farmington, where the old road (former US-91, but never US-89) is SR-106, through the narrow strip of land that separates Farmington Bay from the Wasatch Mountains. US-89 leaves I-15 at exit 324, where the Legacy Parkway also ends, and proceeds north on a freeway. This portion of US-89 {{is the only one}} to include exit numbers based on its own mileage, as opposed to the overlapping I-15 or I-70. The freeway ends after US-89 crosses SR-273, the former <b>surface</b> <b>alignment</b> of US-91 in both directions, and heads north as a four-lane road along the Wasatch foothills, to the east of Layton and Hill Air Force Base. After crossing I-84 in Uintah, US-89 enters Ogden, which it traverses via Washington Boulevard, rejoining old US-91 (now SR-26) south of downtown. Beyond Ogden, US-89 continues in a general northerly direction along the thin strip between Willard Bay and the Wasatch Mountains to Brigham City, where it finally turns east away from the I-15 corridor.|$|E

25|$|In early 1965, this unconstructed {{expressway}} {{was assigned}} the designation I-487, allowing a commercial-vehicle-accessible means of travel {{on the east}} side of the Hudson River. By 1967, strong resident opposition caused the segment from Peekskill to Beacon to be cancelled. In 1971, the section from Tarrytown to Ossining had also been cancelled due to lack of public support. The only portion that was ever built was the section from Crotonville to Peekskill, and was later named the Croton Expressway. The Croton Expressway opened in 1967 with the US9 designation. The original <b>surface</b> <b>alignment</b> of US9 became an extension of NY9A.|$|E
25|$|In the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995, {{the portion}} of US15 in New York was defined as part of I-99. I-99 {{currently}} ends just shy of I-80; however, construction is either underway or has been completed on projects to upgrade US220 and US15 between Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, and Corning to Interstate Highway standards. In June 2007, work began on a new freeway alignment for US15 between the Pennsylvania state line and Watson Creek Road in Lindley. The highway was opened to traffic on October1, 2008. Ownership and maintenance of the former <b>surface</b> <b>alignment</b> of US15 was transferred to Steuben County, which designated the highway as CR115.|$|E
25|$|In the Bronx, I-278 {{becomes the}} Bruckner Expressway and reaches an {{interchange}} with the southern terminus of I-87 (Major Deegan Expressway). At this point, the Bruckner Expressway heads northeast on a six-lane elevated alignment through industrial areas with some residences, paralleling the Northeast Corridor. Along this section, {{there is a}} westbound exit and eastbound entrance for 138th Street. I-895 splits from the eastbound direction of I-278 as the Bruckner Expressway makes a turn to the east into residential and commercial neighborhoods on a <b>surface</b> <b>alignment,</b> crossing the Bronx River on a drawbridge.

40|$|Owing to the {{significant}} price drop of liquid crystal displays (LCDs) {{and the efforts}} to save natural resources, LCDs are even replacing paper to display static images such as price tags and advertising boards. Because of a growing market demand on such devices, the LCD that can be of numerous <b>surface</b> <b>alignments</b> of directors as its ground state, the so-called multi-stable LCD, comes into the limelight due to the great potential for low power consumption. However, the multi-stable LCD with industrial feasibility {{has not yet been}} successfully performed. In this paper, we propose a simple and novel configuration for the multi-stable LCD. We demonstrate experimentally and theoretically that a battery of stable <b>surface</b> <b>alignments</b> can be achieved by the field-induced surface dragging effect on an aligning layer with a weak surface anchoring. The simplicity and stability of the proposed system suggest that it is suitable for the multi-stable LCDs to display static images with low power consumption and thus opens applications in various fields.

25|$|Ownership and {{maintenance}} of the former <b>surface</b> <b>alignment</b> of US219 north of Peters Road—now known as Miller Road, and including the two-lane, high-level bridge that currently carries it across the valley surrounding Cattaraugus Creek—was transferred {{from the state of}} New York to Erie and Cattaraugus counties. The two sections of road leading to and from the bridge were transferred immediately while the bridge itself was not turned over until a state-funded rehabilitation project was completed in 2013. The latter half of the plan drew criticism from Erie County officials who believe that the state should continue to maintain the bridge due to its size, importance and the resulting cost of upkeep. Because of safety concerns, the bridge was closed to traffic on January5, 2012 and remained closed until April of that year while repairs were made to the structure.|$|E
25|$|Eglinton Crosstown LRT: The longest {{proposed}} corridor, at over , {{would be}} along Eglinton Avenue, from Kennedy subway station in Scarborough to Jane Street. Between Keele Street and Laird Drive, the road has been deemed too narrow for a right-of-way, {{and therefore the}} line will run in a tunnel (with underground stations), much like the cancelled Eglinton West subway line. The entire planned route is originally {{expected to be completed}} by 2020. The western section between Mount Dennis and Toronto Pearson International Airport was postponed as a result of provincial funding cuts. It is the only LRT line that survived Rob Ford's cuts, albeit modified to include an extended underground section in the eastern section and the removal of the western section. The eastern underground extension was later revised back to a <b>surface</b> <b>alignment</b> in the 2012 transit vote. Currently, the  long central and eastern sections are under construction with a projected completion date of 2021.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, a {{regional}} transit authority (later Sound Transit) {{was formed to}} build a light rail system for the Seattle metropolitan area. The University District was named as a major destination for the system, with two stations at NE Pacific Street and NE 45th Street {{on the western side}} of the university campus, and would be connected to Downtown Seattle via a tunnel under Capitol Hill. The $6.7 billion proposal, including a light rail line continuing north from the University District to Northgate and Lynnwood, was rejected by voters in 1995 and replaced with a smaller plan. In November 1996, a condensed $3.9 billion regional transit plan was approved by voters, including a shorter light rail line from the University District to Downtown Seattle and SeaTac. A <b>surface</b> <b>alignment</b> through Eastlake was also proposed in the event that tunnel boring through Capitol Hill and under Portage Bay would be too expensive. Sound Transit finalized its preferred alignment for the light rail project in 1999, including stations at NE Pacific Street and NE 45th Street.|$|E

500|$|Similar {{conversion}} {{projects were}} also conducted elsewhere. In Irondequoit, {{the portion of}} the Sea Breeze Expressway (now NY590) from Empire Boulevard to Culver Road opened in the late 1950s. US104 and NY18 were extended eastward along East Ridge Road to meet the expressway at what is now exit11.

2500|$|Each pixel of an LCD {{typically}} {{consists of}} a layer of molecules aligned between two transparent electrodes, and two polarizing filters (parallel and perpendicular), the axes of transmission of which are (in most of the cases) perpendicular to each other. Without the [...] liquid crystal between the polarizing filters, light passing through the first filter would be blocked by the second (crossed) polarizer. Before an electric field is applied, {{the orientation of the}} liquid-crystal molecules is determined by the alignment at the surfaces of electrodes. In a twisted nematic (TN) device, the <b>surface</b> <b>alignment</b> directions at the two electrodes are perpendicular to each other, and so the molecules arrange themselves in a helical structure, or twist. This induces the rotation of the polarization of the incident light, and the device appears gray. If the applied voltage is large enough, the liquid crystal molecules {{in the center of the}} layer are almost completely untwisted and the polarization of the incident light is not rotated as it passes through the liquid crystal layer. This light will then be mainly polarized perpendicular to the second filter, and thus be blocked and the pixel will appear black. By controlling the voltage applied across the liquid crystal layer in each pixel, light can be allowed to pass through in varying amounts thus constituting different levels of gray. [...] Color LCD systems use the same technique, with color filters used to generate red, green, and blue pixels.|$|E
