5|$|Van Peebles had {{received}} a permit to set a car on fire, but had done so on a Friday; as a result, {{there was no time}} to have it filed before shooting the <b>scene.</b> <b>When</b> the scene was shot, a fire truck showed up. This ended up in the final cut of the film.|$|E

5|$|Camus was the {{supposed}} {{leader of a}} Norse expeditionary force defeated by the armies of King Malcolm II at the Battle of Barry. Tradition, popularised {{in the sixteenth century}} by historian Hector Boece, states that Camus fled the battle <b>scene</b> <b>when</b> defeat was imminent, and was caught and slain {{at the point where the}} cross now stands. The battle, and its main protagonists, including Camus, are now known to be historically inauthentic.|$|E
5|$|Detectives began re-examining 10,000 witness statements, and {{submitting}} {{items for}} forensic tests {{not available in}} 1985. In September 2004 the back garden of a terraced council house in Willan Road, near the Broadwater Farm estate, was excavated after a tip-off. A female friend of Cynthia Jarrett, the woman whose death sparked the Broadwater Farm riot, lived alone at the house between 1984 and 1989, {{and according to the}} Evening Standard {{was one of the first}} on the <b>scene</b> <b>when</b> police raided Jarrett's house.|$|E
5|$|During post-production, Vasan asked Ramnoth {{his opinion}} of the <b>scene</b> <b>when</b> {{hundreds}} of Veerasimhan's warriors storm the palace to rescue Chandralekha from Sasankan. Although the scene's photography, shots and action had been unanimously praised by others, Ramnoth was quiet before saying that the suspense might be ruined if the scene was shown uncut. This sparked a discussion; Vasan advised Chandru to edit in accordance with Ramnoth's direction, and {{was impressed with the}} result. C. E. Biggs was the film's audio engineer.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the innovative visual effects for the film, Stokdyk created a miniature of a skyscraper section at 1:16 scale with New Deal Studios' Ian Hunter and David Sanger. Stokdyk chose to design the miniature instead of using computer-generated imagery so damage done to the building could be portrayed realistically and timely without guesswork involving computer models. In addition, to Sony Imageworks, Cafe FX provided visual effects for the crane disaster <b>scene</b> <b>when</b> Spider-Man rescues Gwen Stacy, as well as shots in the climactic battle.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Ruskin {{is at the}} Trudy's murder <b>scene</b> <b>when</b> a guard, believing Ruskin to be Monk, informs him Leverett is the killer. When Stottlemeyer and Disher {{arrive at}} Leverett's car {{dealership}} to arrest him, Ruskin has already arrived and is keeping him as a hostage. Monk enters the dealership and stops Ruskin but is emotionally shaken when Ruskin says he could have saved Trudy. At the end, he talks with Dr. Kroger and cancels his trip.|$|E
5|$|Bill Fulcher supplanted Bud Carson. Fulcher {{appeared}} to be the right choice but quit after two seasons, overwhelmed by the Tech fan base. Fulcher's tenure included a terrible feud with Eddie McAshan, which peaked before the 1972 UGA game. McAshan had requested additional tickets for the game so that his family could attend. Fulcher refused the ticket request and McAshan sat out of practice in protest. Fulcher responded by suspending the quarterback for the UGA game and the upcoming Liberty Bowl. The story exploded on the national <b>scene</b> <b>when</b> Jesse Jackson attended the UGA game, allowing McAshan to sit with him outside of the stadium in protest.|$|E

5|$|De Bont came up {{with the}} idea for the film after he had a {{recurring}} nightmare about a cruise ship crashing into an island. Speed star Keanu Reeves was initially supposed to reprise his role as Jack Traven for the sequel, but decided not to commit and was replaced by Patric prior to filming. Production took place aboard Seabourn Legend, the ship on which the film is set. The film's final <b>scene,</b> <b>when</b> the ship crashes into the island of Saint Martin, cost almost a quarter of the film's budget, and set records as the largest and most expensive stunt ever filmed. Many interior scenes aboard the ship were shot on soundstages in the Greater Los Angeles Area. The film's soundtrack featured mostly reggae music. Mark Mancina returned to compose the film score, which was released as an album 13 years after the film's release.|$|E
5|$|Drive {{has been}} called a tough, hard-edged, neo-noir, art house feature, {{extremely}} violent and very stylish, with European art and grindhouse influences. According to Refn, Drive turns into a superhero film during the elevator <b>scene</b> <b>when</b> The Driver kills the villain. Drive also references 1970s and 1980s cult hits such as The Day of the Locust (1975) and To Live and Die in L.A. (1985). Other influences {{can be seen in the}} neon-bright opening credits and the retro song picks"a mix of tension-ratcheting synthesizer tones and catchy club anthems that collectively give the film its consistent tone". Drives title sequence is hot-pink, which was inspired by Risky Business (1983). Refn has also indicated that the film's romance was partly inspired by the films of writer-director John Hughes.|$|E
5|$|Earp's {{good friend}} William Hart {{produced}} {{and wrote the}} seven-reel epic Wild Bill Hickok released by Paramount in 1923. It was the first movie to depict Wyatt Earp and the only movie that included his character before he died in 1929. Hart played Wild Bill Hickok and Bert Lindley played Earp. The role of Earp's character in the movie was very small. He appears {{at the back of}} a crowd <b>scene</b> <b>when</b> Hickok meets some gentlemen on the city street. Bert Lindley is not listed on some descriptions of the movie and this portrayal of Earp is often overlooked. Alan Barra, author of Inventing Wyatt Earp: His Life and Many Legends, overlooked this movie in his biography. Earp served as a technical adviser on the film.|$|E

5|$|In 1976, a {{few months}} after the {{publication}} of Tintin and the Picaros, Hergé told the journalist Numa Sadoul that he was contemplating the next adventure of Tintin—setting an entire story in an airport lounge. This idea was dropped, and in 1978, he decided to set the story in the world of modern art. During his later years Hergé had grown increasingly interested in this subject, and decided to incorporate his love of avant-garde artwork into the new story. Being a regular at Brussels' art galleries and exhibitions, he was able to draw directly upon his experiences in the art <b>scene</b> <b>when</b> producing the story. Given his age, and the length of time that it was taking him to produce each Adventure, British literary critic Michael Farr suggested that Hergé likely knew that this would be his final installment in the series.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>scene</b> <b>when</b> Homer, Bart and Lisa pick up Maggie {{from the}} daycare center, babies are perched {{all over the}} building, staring at the family and quietly sucking on pacifiers. This is a spoof of the final shot of Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds. Indeed, a cartoon-version of Hitchcock can be seen walking his dogs past the daycare, a {{reference}} to his own cameo appearance in the film. The episode also contains an allusion to the opera scene in Citizen Kane, in which Homer plays with a shredded playbill while he watches {{his wife in the}} musical.|$|E
5|$|Martin Filler {{acknowledged}} that the film legitimately used artistic licence to make valid dramatic points, {{such as in the}} probably imagined <b>scene</b> <b>when</b> George V lectures his son on the importance of broadcasting. Filler cautions that George VI would never have tolerated Logue addressing him casually, nor swearing, and the King almost certainly would have understood a newsreel of Hitler speaking in German. Filler makes the larger point that both the King and his wife were, in reality, lukewarm towards Churchill because of the latter's support for his brother during the abdication crisis. They only warmed to Churchill later in the war, because of his performance as a wartime leader.|$|E

5|$|On August 31, 2003, Sami Atias, an Israeli {{drug dealer}} who {{had belonged to}} an ecstasy ring headed by Abergil and Moshe Malul, was shot at close range and killed {{in the parking lot}} of an Encino café as he was getting into his car. Allegedly he had tried to steal 76 {{kilograms}} of Ecstasy in 2002. According to the indictment, Moshe Malul and fugitive Vineland Boyz′ member Luis Sandoval, were at the <b>scene</b> <b>when</b> Atias was shot, but another man had pulled the trigger. Itzhak Abergil had offered to help with the slaying during a meeting in Spain, but he did not play a direct role in the killing.|$|E
5|$|The Mortaras {{spent the}} morning of 24 June {{attempting}} to have Feletti's order overruled by either the city's cardinal legate, Giuseppe Milesi Pironi Ferretti, or the Archbishop of Bologna, Michele Viale-Prelà, but they found that neither was in the city. Around noon, the Mortaras decided {{to take steps to}} make the separation as painless as possible. Edgardo's siblings were taken to visit relatives while Marianna reluctantly agreed to spend the evening with the wife of Giuseppe Vitta, a Jewish family friend. Around 17:00 Momolo visited San Domenico to make one last plea to Feletti. The inquisitor repeated all he had said to Padovani and Moscato the previous night and told Momolo not to worry as Edgardo would be well cared for, under the protection of the Pope himself. He warned that it would benefit no-one to make a <b>scene</b> <b>when</b> the carabinieri returned that evening.|$|E
5|$|The rain when Jenny and Lindsay's car {{breaks down}} was added {{digitally}} in post-production. The filmmakers {{had not been}} granted permission to film at the roadside location, but went ahead against the authorities' wishes as Six felt the location in the woods was ideal for the <b>scene.</b> <b>When</b> Heiter's window is repaired after Lindsay's escape attempt, {{the use of a}} tracking shot through the window pane required the reflection of the crew to be digitally removed from the glass. The film contains a large number of long tracking shots; Six has cited the influence of Takashi Miike who also uses many tracking shots in his films.|$|E
