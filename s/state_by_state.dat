25|$|The {{divisions}} became fully exposed {{with the}} 1860 presidential election. The electorate split four ways. The Southern Democrats endorsed slavery, while the Republicans denounced it.

25|$|Entitlements vary <b>state</b> <b>by</b> <b>state</b> and {{according}} to the use, source, legal form, level of devolution, security and transferability among others. There has been a move across all states in recent years to move from older forms of water entitlement to more secure and transferable entitlements. Key parts of this move has been the separation of water entitlements from ties to particular parcels of land and the specification of entitlements with specific volumes and reliability.|$|E

25|$|William Saunders planned Gettysburg National Cemetery. He {{enclosed}} it with {{a massive}} stone wall, the lawns were framed by trees and shrubs. The graves were {{laid out in a}} great semicircle, <b>state</b> <b>by</b> <b>state,</b> around the site for a sculptured central feature, a Soldier's National Monument. The Soldier's National Cemetery, as it was then called, was dedicated by President Abraham Lincoln on November 19, 1863. The speaker's platform occupied the site set aside for the Soldier's National Monument, then awaiting future design. The immortal words of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address gave this spot a historical and patriotic association. Gettysburg National Cemetery became the honored property of the nation on May 1, 1872, now a century ago.|$|E
25|$|The one {{tangible}} {{result that}} all the research continually focused on is that community-based services, such as those provided by the HCBS waiver programs, provided a higher {{quality of life for}} disabled individuals. It can also be argued that the research upholds the idea that the cost per individual was lower for those enrolled in the HCBS waiver program than for those attending institutions for similar services. The difficulty when collecting research and data for programs with fewer years of operation is concrete evidence for sufficient analysis. It is also critical {{to keep in mind that}} the HCBS waiver program varies <b>state</b> <b>by</b> <b>state</b> with regard to demographics, funding, state policies, and so forth. The most effective changes come as each state analyzes the overall functionality, success, and performance of their individual HCBS waiver program.|$|E
25|$|On {{receiving}} the proposed Constitution from the Philadelphia Convention, Congress initiated a ratification procedure {{for the proposed}} Constitution which by-passed the sitting state legislatures, going directly {{to the people of}} the country, <b>state</b> <b>by</b> <b>state.</b> Four delegates, James Madison with Edmund Randolph for the Federalists and Patrick Henry with George Mason for the Anti-federalists made most of the speeches of the Convention; 149 of the 170 delegates were silent. An early estimate gave the Federalists seeking ratification a slim margin of 86 to Anti-Federalists rejecting at 80, with four unknowns. Federalists came from the Tidewater and Northern Neck, the Shenandoah Valley and western counties, although the Kentucky counties along the Ohio River feared being abandoned to the Spanish under the new government. The Anti-federalists found strength in the central Piedmont, Southside and southwest counties.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, it is {{possible}} that individuals in a de facto relationship can be treated substantively different to a person in a marriage. In the event of an unexpected end to a de facto relationship (such as death of a partner), the surviving partner must often prove the existence of a relationship in order to be registered as the next of kin on a death certificate and receive government bereavement payments and access to a partner's superannuation. These requirements vary on a <b>state</b> <b>by</b> <b>state</b> basis. Given that same-sex couples do not have the option to marry, as heterosexual couples do, these discrepancies can have a particularly discriminatory impact on same-sex couples. The rights of a de facto partner may be poorly understood by government departments, resulting in occasions where said couples have not had their rights upheld.|$|E
25|$|The final {{prediction}} by FiveThirtyEight on {{the morning}} of election day (November 8, 2016) was at 10:41AM and had Hillary Clinton with a 71% chance to win the 2016 United States presidential election. while other major forecasters had predicted Clinton to win with at least an 85% to 99% probability. FiveThirtyEight's model pointed the possibility of an Electoral College-popular vote split widening in final weeks based on both Clinton's small lead in general polls, but also on Trump's improvement in swing states like Florida or Pennsylvania, mixed with Clinton's poor performing in several of those swing states in comparison with Obama's performing in 2012. The main issues pointed by the forecast model was the unbalance of Clinton's improvement in very populated states like Texas, Georgia (projected safe for Republican) and California (projected safe for Democrats); mixed with her inability to attract white voters without a college degree, an increasing demographic in swing states, in addition to a potential decline in turnout from minorities. In consequence, Clinton's probabilities to win the Electoral College were not improving. Nate Silver also focused on <b>state</b> <b>by</b> <b>state</b> numbers in considered 'must-win' states like Ohio and Florida, plus a consideration of polls' margin of error in advantages of less than three points.|$|E
25|$|Newborn {{screening}}: Newborn screening is used {{just after}} birth to identify genetic disorders {{that can be}} treated early in life. A blood sample is collected with a heel prick from the newborn 24–48 hours after birth {{and sent to the}} lab for analysis. In the United States, newborn screening procedure varies <b>state</b> <b>by</b> <b>state,</b> but all states by law test for at least 21 disorders. If abnormal results are obtained, it does not necessarily mean the child has the disorder. Diagnostic tests must follow the initial screening to confirm the disease. The routine testing of infants for certain disorders is the most widespread use of genetic testing—millions of babies are tested each year in the United States. All states currently test infants for phenylketonuria (a genetic disorder that causes mental illness if left untreated) and congenital hypothyroidism (a disorder of the thyroid gland). People with PKU do not have an enzyme needed to process the amino acid phenylalanine, which is responsible for normal growth in kids and normal protein use throughout their lifetime. If there is a buildup of too much phenylalanine, brain tissue can be damaged, causing developmental delay. Newborn screening can detect the presence of PKU, allowing kids to get put on a special diet right away to avoid the effects of the disorder.|$|E
