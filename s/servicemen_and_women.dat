The art wall and floor installation included Aboriginal fighting artefacts e. g. nulla-nulla, shield, boomerang and spears propped against the wall.

5|$|In {{order to}} {{advocate}} for the many thousands of returned <b>servicemen</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> many ex-services organisations sprang up. The most prominent of these was probably the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia which had been established in 1916 by representatives from many state-based organisations already in existence. Following the war this organisation grew in its political influence as its numbers grew and was very active in the repatriation process, advocating for financial entitlements for veterans and securing concessions for soldiers returning to civilian employment. By 1919 it was estimated to have 150,000 members although this fell dramatically in the mid-1920s.|$|E
5|$|The {{demobilisation}} of the Australian military after World War II involved discharging almost 600,000 men {{and women}} from the military, supporting their transition to civilian life and reducing the three armed services to peacetime strengths. Planning for the demobilisation process began in 1942 and thousands of <b>servicemen</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> were discharged {{in the last years of}} the war in response to shortages of labour in the domestic war economy. The general demobilisation of the military began in October 1945 and was completed in February 1947. The demobilisation process was largely successful, though some military personnel stationed in the South West Pacific complained that their repatriation to Australia was too slow.|$|E

40|$|This chapter argues, {{following}} Angus Calder, {{that there}} was an official line of commemoration of the Second World War: a mythic construction that celebrated heroism, courage, resourcefulness, loyalty and patriotism. It valorised the virtues of the responsible middle class and of officers. Drawing on a range of cultural sources, The chapter concentrates on a counter-hegemonic construction: the 'other war' - a war of skivers, shirkers and petty criminals out for individual gain who displayed the reverse qualities to those lauded in the official myth. The mode for this alternative construction was comedy, which could present this disturbing and unsettling construction under the guise of 'harmless fun'. The chapter focuses on a group of service comedies made from 1945 - 65 that celebrated the wit, respurcefulness and bloodymindedness of the working-class ordinary <b>serviceman</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman</b> which were highly popular and so spoke to a deep-seated irreverence in Britsh culture...|$|R

Some families of <b>servicemen</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> who were killed in Iraq reacted angrily, with one antiwar commentator dismissing Blair's regrets over the loss of life. Shortly after the release of A Journey, the screenwriter of the 2006 film The Queen, which depicts Blair's first months in office, accused Blair of plagiarising a conversation with Elizabeth II from him.|$|E

5000|$|East Macedonia and Thrace {{came under}} Bulgarian {{occupation}} and was annexed to Bulgaria, which had long claimed these territories. The remaining {{two thirds of}} Greece was occupied by Italy, with the Ionian Islands directly administered as Italian territories. Count Pellegrino Ghigi represented Italian interests with the Greek government while General Carlo Geloso commanded the 11th Army occupying Greece. Relations between the Germans and Italians were not good and frequently Greek bars that hosted servicemen from the two Axis nations were the scenes of bloody fights. It was German policy to strongly discourage relationships between German <b>servicemen</b> <b>and</b> Greek <b>women</b> as the German leaders feared miscegenation between the [...] "pure" [...] Aryan Germans and the racially inferior Greeks, who were seen as debased Aryans, [...] "tainted" [...] by miscegenation during the long period of Ottoman rule. By contrast, the Italians had no such inhibitions, which utterly disgusted Wehrmacht and SS officers. German officers often complained that the Italians {{were more interested in}} making love than in making war, and that the Italians lacked the necessary [...] "hardness" [...] to wage a counter-guerrilla campaign because so many Italian soldiers had Greek girlfriends. After the Italian capitulation in September 1943, the Italian zone was taken over by the Germans, who often attacked the Italian garrisons.
