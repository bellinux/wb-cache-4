5|$|Even mild or <b>subclinical</b> {{hypothyroidism}} {{leads to}} possible infertility and {{increased risk of}} miscarriage. Hypothyroidism in early pregnancy, even with limited or no symptoms, may {{increase the risk of}} pre-eclampsia, offspring with lower intelligence, and the risk of infant death around the time of birth. Women are affected by hypothyroidism in 0.3–0.5% of pregnancies. <b>Subclinical</b> hypothyroidism during pregnancy has also been associated with gestational diabetes and birth of the baby before 37 weeks of pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|Many people {{infected}} with HSV-2 display no physical symptoms—individuals with no symptoms {{are described as}} asymptomatic or as having <b>subclinical</b> herpes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Subclinical</b> {{hypothyroidism}} is a milder form of hypothyroidism {{characterized by}} an elevated serum TSH level, but with a normal serum free thyroxine level. This milder form of hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by Hashimoto's thyroiditis. In adults it is diagnosed when TSH levels are greater than 5 mIU/L and less than 10mIU/L. The presentation of <b>subclinical</b> hypothyroidism is variable and classic {{signs and symptoms of}} hypothyroidism may not be observed. Of people with <b>subclinical</b> hypothyroidism, a proportion will develop overt hypothyroidism each year. In those with detectable antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO), this occurs in 4.3%, while in those with no detectable antibodies, this occurs in 2.6%. Those with <b>subclinical</b> hypothyroidism and detectable anti-TPO antibodies who do not require treatment should have repeat thyroid function tests more frequently (e.g. yearly) compared with those who do not have antibodies.|$|E
5|$|Women {{are more}} likely to develop {{hypothyroidism}} than men. In population-based studies, women were seven times {{more likely than men to}} have TSH levels above 10 mU/l. 2–4% of people with <b>subclinical</b> hypothyroidism will progress to overt hypothyroidism each year. The risk is higher in those with antibodies against thyroid peroxidase. <b>Subclinical</b> hypothyroidism is estimated to affect approximately 2% of children; in adults, <b>subclinical</b> hypothyroidism is more common in the elderly, and in Caucasians. There is a much higher rate of thyroid disorders, the most common of which is hypothyroidism, in individuals with Down syndrome and Turner syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide {{about one}} billion people are {{estimated}} to be iodine deficient; however, it is unknown how often this results in hypothyroidism. In large population-based studies in Western countries with sufficient dietary iodine, 0.3–0.4% of the population have overt hypothyroidism. A larger proportion, 4.3–8.5%, have <b>subclinical</b> hypothyroidism. Of people with <b>subclinical</b> hypothyroidism, 80% have a TSH level below the 10mIU/l mark regarded as the threshold for treatment. Children with <b>subclinical</b> hypothyroidism often return to normal thyroid function, and a small proportion develops overt hypothyroidism (as predicted by evolving antibody and TSH levels, the presence of celiac disease, and the presence of a goiter).|$|E
5|$|Women with anti-TPO {{antibodies}} who {{are trying}} to become pregnant (naturally or by assisted means) may require thyroid hormone supplementation even if the TSH level is normal. This is particularly true if they have had previous miscarriages or have been hypothyroid in the past. Supplementary levothyroxine may reduce the risk of preterm birth and possibly miscarriage. The recommendation is stronger in pregnant women with <b>subclinical</b> hypothyroidism (defined as TSH 2.5–10mIU/l) who are anti-TPO positive, in view of the risk of overt hypothyroidism. If a decision is made not to treat, close monitoring of the thyroid function (every 4 weeks in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy) is recommended. If anti-TPO is not positive, treatment for <b>subclinical</b> hypothyroidism is not currently recommended. It has been suggested that many of the aforementioned recommendations could lead to unnecessary treatment, {{in the sense that the}} TSH cutoff levels may be too restrictive in some ethnic groups; there may be little benefit from treatment of <b>subclinical</b> hypothyroidism in certain cases.|$|E
5|$|In pregnancy, <b>subclinical</b> {{hypothyroidism}} {{is defined}} as a TSH between 2.5 and 10mIU/l with a normal thyroxine level, while those with TSH above 10mIU/l are considered to be overtly hypothyroid even if the thyroxine level is normal. Antibodies against TPO may be important in making decisions about treatment, and should, therefore, be determined in women with abnormal thyroid function tests.|$|E
5|$|Many {{cases of}} {{hypothyroidism}} {{are associated with}} mild elevations in creatine kinase and liver enzymes in the blood. They typically return to normal when hypothyroidism has been fully treated. Levels of cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and lipoprotein (a) can be elevated; the impact of <b>subclinical</b> hypothyroidism on lipid parameters is less well-defined.|$|E
5|$|No {{single test}} has {{adequate}} {{sensitivity and specificity}} to diagnose pelvic inflammatory disease. A large multisite U.S. study found that cervical motion tenderness as a minimum clinical criterion increases {{the sensitivity of the}} CDC diagnostic criteria from 83 percent to 95 percent. However, even the modified 2002 CDC criteria do not identify women with <b>subclinical</b> disease.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} tests {{that can be used}} to test the {{function}} of the thyroid, for the presence of diseases, and for the success or failure of treatment. Blood tests in general aim to measure thyroid function or determine the cause of thyroid dysfunction. Thyroid function tests include a battery of blood tests including the measurement of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4, as well as the measurement of TSH. They may reveal hyperthyroidism (high T3 and T4), hypothyroidism (low T3, T4), or <b>subclinical</b> hyperthyroidism (normal T3 and T4 with a low TSH).|$|E
5|$|Most {{people with}} {{hypothyroidism}} symptoms and confirmed thyroxine deficiency {{are treated with}} a synthetic long-acting form of thyroxine, known as levothyroxine (L-thyroxine). In young and otherwise healthy people with overt hypothyroidism, a full replacement dose (adjusted by weight) can be started immediately; in the elderly and people with heart disease a lower starting dose is recommended to prevent over supplementation and risk of complications. Lower doses may be sufficient in those with <b>subclinical</b> hypothyroidism, while people with central hypothyroidism may require a higher than average dose.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{of severe}} and even fatal {{hepatotoxicity}} {{related to the}} use of methoxyflurane began to appear in 1966. These reports prompted anesthesiologists to subject this agent to intense and systematic scrutiny. A study published in 1973 by Cousins and Mazze demonstrated that compared with halothane, methoxyflurane produces dose-dependent and deleterious abnormalities in renal function. The authors showed that <b>subclinical</b> nephrotoxicity occurred following methoxyflurane at minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) for 2.5 to 3hours (2.5 to 3MAC hours), while overt toxicity was present in all patients at dosages greater than five MAC hours. This landmark study provided a model that would be used for the assessment of the nephrotoxicity of volatile anesthetics for the next two decades.|$|E
5|$|The levels found {{today in}} {{most people are}} orders of {{magnitude}} greater than those of pre-industrial society. Due to reductions of lead in products and the workplace, acute lead poisoning is rare in most countries today, but low level lead exposure is still common. It {{was not until the}} second half of the 20th century that <b>subclinical</b> lead exposure became understood to be a problem. During the end of the 20th century, the blood lead levels deemed acceptable steadily declined. Blood lead levels once considered safe are now considered hazardous, with no known safe threshold.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} {{clinical}} forms of smallpox. Variola major was the severe and most common form, {{with a more}} extensive rash and higher fever. Variola minor was a less common presentation, and a much less severe disease, with historical death rates of 1 percent or less. <b>Subclinical</b> (asymptomatic) infections with variola virus were noted but were not common. In addition, a form called variola sine eruptione (smallpox without rash) was seen generally in vaccinated persons. This form was marked by a fever that occurred after the usual incubation period and could be confirmed only by antibody studies or, rarely, by virus isolation.|$|E
25|$|However, while {{clinical}} hyperthyroidism {{is associated}} with frank neuropsychological and affective alterations, the occurrence of these alterations and their treatment in mild and <b>subclinical</b> hyperthyroidism remains a controversial issue. Regardless of the inconsistent findings, a 2007 study by Andersen et al. states that the distinction between <b>subclinical</b> and overt thyroid disease is in any case somewhat arbitrary. <b>Subclinical</b> hyperthyroidism {{has been reported in}} 63% of euthyroid Graves' disease., but only in 4% of cases where Graves' disease was in remission.|$|E
25|$|<b>Subclinical</b> PNH. PNH {{abnormalities}} on {{flow cytometry}} without signs of hemolysis.|$|E
25|$|Chronic, <b>subclinical</b> {{exposure}} {{does not}} lead to symptoms so dramatic as acute aflatoxicosis.|$|E
25|$|In <b>subclinical</b> hyperthyroidism, serum TSH is {{abnormally}} low, but T4- and T3-levels {{fall within}} laboratory reference ranges. It primarily affects the skeleton and the cardiovascular system (abnormalities in other systems {{have also been}} reported), in a similar but less severe and less frequent way than overt hyperthyroidism does. It can alter cardiac function, with increased heart rate, increased left ventricular mass index, increased cardiac contractility, diastolic dysfunction, and induction of ectopic atrial beats. Long-term mild excess of thyroid hormone can thus cause impaired cardiac reserve and exercise capacity. In a large population-based study of 2008, the odds of having poorer cognitive function were greater for <b>subclinical</b> hyperthyroidism than for stroke, diabetes mellitus, and Parkinson's disease. <b>Subclinical</b> hyperthyroidism might modestly {{increase the risk of}} cognitive impairment and dementia.|$|E
25|$|L-Thyroxine over-replacement may {{contribute}} to osteoporosis, {{in a similar fashion}} as thyrotoxicosis does. This can be relevant in <b>subclinical</b> hypothyroidism.|$|E
25|$|The intima-media {{thickness}} of the carotid artery wall is a marker of <b>subclinical</b> atherosclerosis, it increases with age and with long-term exposure to particulate air pollution.|$|E
25|$|Asymptomatic <b>subclinical</b> {{infection}} {{may help}} spread these diseases, particularly Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, V. cholerae, and Yersini. For example, as of 1984 {{it was estimated}} that in the United States, 200,000 people were asymptomatic carriers of Salmonella.|$|E
25|$|Antibodies to {{herpes zoster}} can be measured. A 4-fold {{increase}} {{has been used}} to support the diagnosis of <b>subclinical</b> herpes zoster (zoster sine herpete). However, a rising titer secondary to viral exposure rather than reactivation cannot be ruled out.|$|E
25|$|Cumulative {{effects from}} this process {{should not be}} {{confused}} with long-term effects—when short-term effects have disappeared and long-term effects are <b>subclinical,</b> reirradiation can still be problematic. These doses are calculated by the radiation oncologist and many factors are taken into account before the subsequent radiation takes place.|$|E
25|$|The chronic {{recurrent}} phase may {{be marked}} by repeated bouts of uveitis, but is more commonly a chronic, low-grade, often <b>subclinical,</b> uveitis {{that may lead}} to granulomatous anterior inflammation, cataracts, glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Full-blown recurrences are, however, rare after the acute stage is over. Dysacusia may occur in this phase.|$|E
25|$|Inflammation and {{extension}} of scaling outside the scalp exclude {{the diagnosis of}} dandruff from seborrhoeic dermatitis. However, many reports suggest a clear link between the two clinical entities - the mildest form of the clinical presentation of seborrhoeic dermatitis as dandruff, where the inflammation is minimal and remain <b>subclinical.</b>|$|E
25|$|Long-term {{exposure}} to nitrous oxide may cause vitamin B deficiency. It inactivates the cobalamin form of vitamin B12 by oxidation. Symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency, including sensory neuropathy, myelopathy, and encephalopathy, may occur within {{days or weeks}} of {{exposure to}} nitrous oxide anaesthesia in people with <b>subclinical</b> vitamin B12 deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{theories}} {{postulated that}} the virus remained in the body for a lifetime. However, studies using sensitive DNA techniques have shown that through immunological response the virus can either be cleared or suppressed to levels below what polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests can measure. One study testing genital skin for <b>subclinical</b> HPV using PCR found a prevalence of 10%.|$|E
25|$|In {{veterinary}} medicine, it is a well-recognized {{cause of}} bovine mastitis, {{hence the name}} dys-galactiae. In some geographic regions, it is reported only second to Staphylococcus aureus {{as a cause of}} both clinical and <b>subclinical</b> mastitis. S. dysgalactiae has been particularly linked to mastitis occurring during the summer time (“Summer mastitis”), and bacterial spreading by flying insects has been suggested. Mastitis in other animals has also been documented.|$|E
25|$|Epilepsy {{has been}} noticed in a {{sampling}} of coeliac disease patients. One prime example is calcium channel obstruction {{in the brain and}} dementia. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that <b>subclinical</b> cases in older adults will typically progress toward dementia, a large number of studies in Italy and Spain have documented earlier onset cases, though the autoimmune condition is not known, folic acid malabsorption may be the cause.|$|E
25|$|<b>Subclinical</b> {{deficiency}} {{has also}} been observed in women taking oral contraceptives, in the elderly, in people with eating disorders, chronic alcoholism and in diseases such as HIV, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes and chronic heart disease. The Celiac Disease Foundation points out that a gluten-free diet may be low in riboflavin (and other nutrients) as enriched wheat flour and wheat foods (bread, pasta, cereals, etc.) is a major dietary contribution to total riboflavin intake.|$|E
25|$|Scurvy or <b>subclinical</b> scurvy {{is caused}} by a {{deficiency}} of vitamin C. In modern Western societies, scurvy is rarely present in adults, although infants and elderly people are affected. Virtually all commercially available baby formulas contain added vitamin C, preventing infantile scurvy. Human breast milk contains sufficient vitamin C, if the mother has an adequate intake. Commercial milk is pasteurized, a heating process that destroys the natural vitamin C content of the milk.|$|E
25|$|Oral {{polio vaccine}} is highly {{effective}} and inexpensive (about US$0.10 per dose, or US$0.30 per child) and its availability has bolstered efforts to eradicate polio. A study {{carried out in}} an isolated Eskimo village showed that antibodies produced from <b>subclinical</b> wild virus infection persisted for at least 40 years. Because the immune response to oral polio vaccine {{is very similar to}} natural polio infection, it is expected that oral polio vaccination provides similar lifelong immunity to the virus.|$|E
25|$|Biotin {{deficiency}} can {{be caused}} by inadequate dietary intake or inheritance of one or more inborn genetic disorders that affect biotin metabolism. <b>Subclinical</b> deficiency can cause mild symptoms, such as hair thinning or skin rash typically on the face. Neonatal screening for biotinidase deficiency began in the United States in 1984 and today many countries test for this disorder at birth. Individuals born prior to 1984 are unlikely to have been screened, thus the true prevalence of the disorder is unknown.|$|E
25|$|More than 900 {{drugs have}} {{been implicated in}} causing liver injury (see LiverTox, {{external}} link, below) {{and it is the}} most common reason for a drug to be withdrawn from the market. Hepatotoxicity and drug-induced liver injury also account for a substantial number of compound failures, highlighting the need for drug screening assays, such as stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells, that are capable of detecting toxicity early in the drug development process. Chemicals often cause <b>subclinical</b> injury to the liver, which manifests only as abnormal liver enzyme tests.|$|E
25|$|After Clemetson’s {{retirement}} from teaching in 1991, his work focused on developing {{the hypothesis that}} the hemorrhages seen in infants with shaken baby syndrome are caused not by inflicted trauma, but by capillary damage due to Barlow's disease (<b>subclinical</b> scurvy) - a condition called by proponents Clemetson/Kalokerinos syndrome. The mechanism he argued to be high histamine levels associated with low serum vitamin C, the latter deficiency arising before birth due to factors such as the pregnant mother's malnutrition, and in the infant by recurrent infections and recent multiple vaccinations.|$|E
25|$|F. magna {{infections in}} {{definitive}} hosts are usually <b>subclinical.</b> However, massive deaths {{caused by the}} fluke in red-, fallow- and roe deer were reported. Lethargy, depression, weight loss and decreased quality of antlers can occur sporadically. In addition, nervous symptoms were observed very rarely. In the first case, urging motion followed by apathy was reported in one experimentally infected fallow deer. Authors suggested that these symptoms were associated with hepatocerebral syndrome. Other author has observed partial paralysis in naturally infected wapiti caused by migrating juvenile flukes in the spinal cord.|$|E
