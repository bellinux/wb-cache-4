5|$|Immediately after {{returning}} from Canada, Monson was called to the high council of the Valley View Stake in Holladay. Two months later he was made area supervisor over nine stake missions (Winder, Wilford, Monument Park, Monument Park West, Hillside, Highland, Parleys, Sugarhouse, and Wasatch).

5|$|The <b>stakes</b> <b>were</b> {{raised in}} the {{conflict}} on 10 October, when the High Court declared valid the Act granting the territories two senators each. In a half-Senate election, most successful candidates would not take their places until 1 July 1976, but the territories' senators, and those filling Field's and Bunton's seats, would assume their seats at once. This gave Labor an outside chance of controlling the Senate, at least until 1 July 1976.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the stylistic}} {{innovations}} Radama adopted {{for the construction}} of several of the compound's buildings, the Rova largely retained its traditional features during his reign. The basic layout of the compound remained largely unaltered from its original design with the sole exception of an expansion of the Rova along its north-south axis. Stone walls topped with sharpened wooden <b>stakes</b> <b>were</b> built around the new perimeter during this period. Venerable buildings such as Besakana, Nanjakana, Mahitsy and Manjakamiadana were retained, as were the houses of several of Andrianampoinimerina's wives, many of whom were still living at the time of Radama's death in 1828. During his reign, Radama undertook the restoration of Marivolanitra to serve chiefly as housing for visiting foreigners, and briefly inhabited it himself in addition to his main residence at Besakana. He also had a house called Kelisoa ("Petite Beauty") built as a lodging for his concubines.|$|E

50|$|The first Latter Day Saint <b>stake</b> <b>was</b> {{organized}} {{at church}} headquarters in Kirtland, Ohio on February 17, 1834, with Joseph Smith as its president. The second <b>stake</b> <b>was</b> organized in Clay County, Missouri, {{later that year}} on July 3, with David Whitmer as president.

5|$|Djokovic and Murray met for {{the first}} time since the {{aforementioned}} French Open final in the championship match of the season-concluding ATP World Tour Finals in London in November. Of the five meetings (all in championship matches) that took place between the pair in 2016, this one had added significance, as for the first time in tournament history, the two finalists had the chance to become year-end number 1 by winning the title. The <b>stakes</b> <b>were</b> high in Djokovic's case, as a win would have seen him win his fifth consecutive year-end title, and sixth overall (matching the record held by Roger Federer); Murray, on the other hand, was shooting for his first year-end title, having qualified for the championship match for the first time. Ultimately, Murray won in straight sets, ensuring he ended the year ranked world number one, and also becoming the first man other than Djokovic, Federer or Rafael Nadal to finish the year at the top of the rankings since Andy Roddick in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Sham, {{who had won}} the Santa Anita Derby, {{was seen}} as the most {{formidable}} challenger to Secretariat in the Derby because of his finish ahead of Secretariat in the Wood and his Santa Anita victory. Coming off the heels of the his victory at the Wood, Angle Light was seen as a threat to win. Angle Light was also trained by Lucien Laurin, along with as Secretariat, and thus Secretariat and Angle Light were coupled for betting purposes. Flamingo Stakes winner Our Native finished first or second in seven of his nine starts during the 1973 season, causing him to be named as a contender. Blue Grass Stakes winner My Gallant and Shecky Greene, who won the Fountain of Youth <b>Stakes,</b> <b>were</b> both trained in Chicago by Lou Goldline, which also resulted in their odds being coupled. Goldline said the two horses were similar and would do well at Churchill Downs because they both liked fast tracks. Impecunious, who was victorious in the Arkansas Derby, was initially entered in the race, but withdrew two days before because of a bruised heel. None of the competing horses had been sired by a previous Derby winner.|$|E
25|$|The limes {{itself is}} a {{relatively}} simple construction. It {{is similar to the}} fortification that a travelling troop of Roman soldiers would construct every evening to protect their camp from attacks. On the outside, the soldiers dug a ditch. The earth from the ditch was used to build a mound. On top of the mound <b>stakes</b> <b>were</b> attached. The Limes had a deeper ditch and a higher mound. The <b>stakes</b> <b>were</b> higher too and in front of the ditch while on several parts of the limes, instead of stakes there was a simple stone wall.|$|E

25|$|The {{issue of}} {{privilege}} gradually made Johnson reconsider {{his own business}} career. 'Traction' (streetcar) companies depended on route franchises granted by city councils; political connections and payoffs gave favored companies the upper hand. In an era when most everyone rode the cars, the <b>stakes</b> <b>were</b> high, and battles for franchises were often the hidden issue behind cities' factional strife.|$|E
25|$|The Confiscation Act of 1862 {{allowed the}} Treasury Department to sell many {{captured}} {{lands on the}} grounds of delinquent taxes. All told, the government now claimed 76,775 acres of Sea Island land. Auditors arrived in Port Royal and began to assess the estates now occupied by blacks and missionaries. The <b>stakes</b> <b>were</b> high: the Sea Island cotton harvest represented a lucrative commodity for Northern investors to control.|$|E
25|$|The 1876 {{match against}} Steinitz {{was held at}} the West-end Chess Club in London. The <b>stakes</b> <b>were</b> £60 a side with the winner taking all.

25|$|The simple shapes {{made by the}} {{tinsmith}} require tools {{similar to}} a coppersmith. In addition to the big shears anchored in {{a hole in his}} bench he used hand snips and nippers for cutting. The tin was flattened on an anvil made of a block of steel. Straight and curved anvils (<b>stakes)</b> <b>were</b> used to turn and roll the edges of the tin. Solder was then used to join the pieces together; a soldering iron and fire pot were needed to do this.|$|E
25|$|The German foreign {{ministry}} at Wilhelmstraße, {{on the other}} hand, wanted to exploit Finland's precarious situation {{after the fall of}} Vyborg to connect military aid to political concessions. Ryti and Mannerheim did not know the internal balance between OKW and Wilhelmstraße, and the <b>stakes</b> <b>were</b> too high to risk Ribbentrop's pressuring the Wehrmacht to withdraw its support from Finland. The decision to send the letter was made in the evening of June 25, the same day the Red army managed to break through the VKT-line at Tali.|$|E
25|$|In the LDS Church, {{the largest}} of the Latter Day Saint denominations, the quorums of the seventy are {{directed}} and supervised hierarchically by the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, who are in turn directed by the First Presidency.

25|$|Booby traps {{ranged from}} the simple to the complex. Non-explosive traps {{included}} the well-known sharpened punji stake coated in excrement, and mounted on sapling triggers and placed in shallow, covered pits. <b>Stakes</b> <b>were</b> deployed where infantry would walk or fling themselves to avoid attack such as roadside trenches, or behind logs. One of these devices was to injure a future Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff - Colin Powell. Another type of trap was a spiked mud ball that swung down on its victim after a trip wire release, impaling him. Other impalement devices included bamboo whips and triggered sapling spikes. Bows with poisoned arrows were also used.|$|E
25|$|In 1978 Cork set out {{to secure}} an {{impressive}} third successive All-Ireland title. The team go {{off to a good}} start with McCarthy won an eighth Munster medal following a 0–13 to 0–11 defeat of Clare in a dour provincial decider. This victory paved the way for Cork to take on Kilkenny in the subsequent All-Ireland final. The <b>stakes</b> <b>were</b> high as Cork were attempting to capture a first three in-a-row since 1954. The game, however, was not the classic that many expected. Cork were never really troubled over the course of the seventy minutes and a Jimmy Barry-Murphy goal helped the team to a 1–15 to 2–8 victory over their age-old rivals. This victory gave Cork a third All-Ireland title in succession and gave McCarthy a fifth and final All-Ireland medal.|$|E
