50|$|He was {{a lifelong}} fighter against communalism. He {{was one of}} the first leaders who {{recognized}} the threat posed by the rise of the communal forces to the <b>secular</b> <b>principle</b> of the Indian State. He played a crucial role in 1989, 1996 and 2004 in creating the political formations and the setting up of governments which excluded the communal forces. Surjeet played a remarkable role in the defence of national unity and in formulating policies to counter the threat from the divisive forces. His firm stance and leadership in fighting against Khalistani terrorism in Punjab and the sacrifice made by over 200 Communists in fighting extremism constitutes a glorious chapter. From the late fifties, Surjeet was involved in tackling the problems of Jammu & Kashmir. He played a role in the evolution of the Assam Accord in the eighties. Imbued with deep anti-imperialism and the values of the nationalist movement, Surjeet looked at all issues of national unity from a democratic and secular standpoint.|$|E

The political actors, their strategies, and methods of instrumentalisation of Islam in the third largest Muslim majority country of the world are indicative of how and why the ideology of Islamism appeals, and how domestic, regional and international events influence the dynamics. The findings that the war in Afghanistan between 1979 and 1989, US foreign policy towards the Middle East, and the fifty year regional rivalry between India and Pakistan facilitated this transformation as much as domestic power jockeying made other analysts take pause before presenting simplistic interpretations such as poverty or Muslim exceptionalism as the causes.|$|E

40|$|Despite first impressions, the High Court’s {{decision}} in the chaplaincy case was far from a clear victory for federalism, writes Graeme Orr In Inside Story •VISITORS to the valleys and downs west of Brisbane often note the region’s religiosity, reflected in billboards, makeshift and professional, decrying abortion or proclaiming the Gospel. Though he’s as fecund as any biblical patriarch, Toowoomba father of seven Ron Williams doesn’t drink from the same philosophical well. Late last week, he succeeded in having the national school chaplaincy program declared unconstitutional, at least in its present form. Williams was offended that the secular status of his children’s public school was diluted by a program established by the Howard government and continued by Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard. Politically, the scheme represents third-way thinking: churches delivering social welfare. Economically, it is canny. While {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars have been invested so far, chaplains are not well-paid.

40|$|The {{nineteenth century}} radically {{transformed}} education from a church function {{to a state}} duty. During the early to late 1800 s, Australian legislators debated the foundations of education for their new society. Decades of acrimonious argument, and sustained (but failed) attempts to create a workable denominational system led the colonies to explore more radical options. To minimize religious division, Australia 2 ̆ 7 s proposal was for public education to be “free, compulsory and secular. ” New South Wales legislated these then politically progressive principles in the Public Instruction Act of 1880, following Victoria in 1872, and Queensland and South Australia in 1875. No state defined the term “secular” and each interpreted it differently. Prolonged, ambiguous applications of the <b>secular</b> <b>principle</b> continue to create confusion and division today. This article examines constructions of the “secular” in education and compares the approaches of Henry Parkes in New South Wales and George Higinbotham in Victoria. It follows the erosion of secular intent in public and parliamentary debates from early settlement to 1880...|$|E

40|$|The global {{response}} to the tsunami disaster in south Asia on 26 December 2004 has been overwhelming. Approxi-mately US $ 6 billion have been pledged in aid by citizens and governments, and authorities have offered military assis-tance and debt relief (W 1). This outpour-ing of goodwill reflects the universality of the humanitarian impulse: an innate, altruistic urge to assist fellow human beings who are suffering (W 2), which the President of MSF International recently described as “a visceral and practical response of one human being to the suffering of another ” (W 3). Codified in most cultures and all major religions, it {{is also found in}} the <b>secular</b> <b>principle</b> of “humanity ” to which so many humani-tarian agencies subscribe (W 4). The strength of the humanitarian impulse can be affected by various fac-tors, among them people’s closeness to the suffering (as the media brought the tsunami victims into our living rooms), the suddenness of the disaster, the num-ber of victims, and the ease with which people can empathize with the victims (for example, the many western tourists). Natural disasters are also much more likely to elicit a humanitarian impulse than are civil wars, because the victims are seen as blameless. Finally, professional perspectives are also influential: clinical doctors and public health professionals are both driven by humanity, but the reaction of public health professionals is also mediated by population-based mor-bidity and mortality statistics — which leads to a different response. The very strong humanitarian impulse to relieve the suffering of those affected by the tsunami was mainly very positive, but it may unfortunately have resulted in some undesirable side-effects. Much of the assistance was inappropriate, with health agencies not able to match their enormous resources to the modest immediate health needs of the victims. In some areas, the over-abundance of outside helpers added to problems of coordination. For example, one agency working in Aceh, Indonesia...|$|E
