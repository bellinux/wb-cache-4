40|$|Traditionally, male parental {{effort and}} mate {{attraction}} effort {{are expected to}} be in conflict as they compete for the same resource budget. However, the quality of care provided by the male may be of a direct benefit to females and may provide an important mate choice cue. In a laboratory experiment, we examined how males modified their parental behavior with respect to mating opportunity by allowing male <b>sand</b> <b>gobies</b> to mate with a single female either in a big or small nest (a constraint on future mating potential). We then exposed half of these males to the visual stimulus from additional females and recorded male egg fanning and nest building (two components of care), courtship behavior, and reproductive success through out the brood cycle. We found that males fanned longer and more frequently and did more nest construction in the presence of females and in big nests. Males guarding large nests courted females more than did males guarding small nests. All males consumed eggs during the brood cycle, but complete clutch cannibalism was most frequent when males were guarding small nests in the absence of females. The pattern of filial cannibalism that we observed suggests that males prematurely terminated care when their reproductive potential was low, that is, when there was little nest space for additional mating and no mates present. We found no support for a trade-off between mate attraction and parental care. Indeed, taken together our results suggest that males may use parental care as a courtship strategy and that males who invest in mate attraction also have higher parental effort.

40|$|As one of {{the most}} {{important}} processes underlying biodiversity, (adaptive) radiation has since long enthralled evolutionary biologists. The phenomenon is often linked with closed systems (e. g. islands or lakes), sympatric speciation and species flocks  although this association is not always a given fact. In any case, radiation provides an ideal setting for the study of speciation. Textbook cases are found in two of the most species-rich fish families, cichlids and gobies. We focus on a clade of each of them, the tropheine cichlids from Lake Tanganyika and the <b>sand</b> <b>gobies</b> from the Eastern Mediterranean. As such, we include an example of both major types of fish species flocks: a lacustrine, sympatric one (Tropheini), and a case of vicariant allopatry (<b>sand</b> <b>gobies).</b> Next to species flocks, parasites provide another exquisite study system in speciation and radiation research. They often show a tendency towards specialization, in that they often only infect a single host species or organ. Therefore, host diversity and the wealth of microhabitats available within their host niche allow them to diversify into abundant members of biodiversity. Parasites are even purported to account for more than half of all species on Earth. Co-phylogenetic research compares host and parasite trees in an attempt to explain the contribution of various speciation modes to parasite biodiversity. Possibilities include co-speciation, host-switch (= ecological transfer), duplication within a host species, extinction or failure to diverge. Prerequisites for co-phylogenetic analysis are comprehensive sampling of host and parasite clades, sound systematics for both actors, understanding of the historical-biogeographical context and a close association between host and parasite. For the chosen well-defined host systems (tropheine cichlids and <b>sand</b> <b>gobies),</b> reaching decent taxon coverage is not impossible; from there onwards, it is clear which phylogenetic and biogeographic work lies ahead to provide a framework for co-phylogeny. Regarding the choice of parasites targeted, we opt for monogenean flatworms. These inconspicuous and hence often overlooked animals are mostly ectoparasites of bony fishes. By virtue of their direct lifecycle (no intermediate hosts) and alleged host-specificity, they offer the required intimate relationship with their host species. Other advantages are their high species diversity and relative harmlessness, rendering Monogenea an extensive dataset of quite neutral markers. As no formal reports of Monogenea exist for either of the two host systems, the description of new parasite faunas is an important part of the task at hand. First of all, adequate understanding of host taxonomy and phylogeny is paramount. In the case of Tropheini, host phylogeny is well-studied and up-to-date. However, high-resolution sampling along the western shoreline of Lake Tanganyika revealed taxonomic problems in these and other fishes that need be addressed using genetic tools and parasitological data. Exploring the lakes diversity of monogeneans, we uncovered major differences between the two ectoparasitic genera most often encountered on Tanganyika cichlids, Gyrodactylus and Cichlidogyrus. The former is seldom observed. Morphological and molecular species identification showed one of its representatives to infect a range of hosts. Other proof of host-switching are the three morphologically and genetically highly diverged species found on a single host species, Simochromis diagramma. Similarly, deep morphological diversity was found in the Cichlidogyrus of ectodine cichlids. These observations suggest that Lake Tanganyika harbours highly diverse and possibly ancient monogenean lineages, as it does for cichlids. The more host-specific Cichlidogyrus is the most common monogenean ectoparasite on Tanganyika cichlids, hence our target for co-phylogenetic analysis. Available host data, and a nuclear-mitochondrial dataset of Cichlidogyrus infecting Tropheini, with extensive geographic and taxonomic coverage, were used. A significant signal of co-speciation was found; within-host diversification is the most frequent speciation mode in these parasites. We hypothesize that parasite species richness is mainly driven by host availability and, at least in case of stenotopic host species, host allopatry. This underpins the importance of host biology in mediating parasite species richness. Phylogeographic analyses are recommended to test these patterns on a population-level scale, especially for the model cichlid Tropheus. In Europe, the goby fauna demonstrates that even in that continent, fish biodiversity is by far fully understood. For the Balkan <b>sand</b> <b>gobies,</b> we reconstruct a mitochondrial phylogeny, addressing taxonomical and conservational concerns. This phylogenetic reconstruction was compared to that of their Gyrodactylus parasites (three markers). While co-speciation was found to be significant here as well, host-switching is more important than in Cichlidogyrus. This is explained by the colonization mode of Gyrodactylus (offering the potential for transfer) and by episodes of host sympatry (offering an opportunity for it). Some cases of within-host diversification, possibly related to fish size, were observed, supporting the utility of parasites as evolutionary magnifying glasses for their hosts history. Comparing different host-parasite settings, our approach allows generalizations about speciation in monogenean parasites. It highlights the importance of both the potential (colonise a host) and the opportunity (host availability) to diversify, akin to any radiation process. Some recommendations are made concerning how to combine morphological and molecular data, and regarding geographic and phylogenetic expansions of this research to disentangle the mechanisms and origins of parasitic flatworm diversification. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Many {{fish species}} emit sounds in agonistic contexts. During direct {{confrontations}} sounds are typically produced during the display phase {{in conjunction with}} visual exhibitions. Here we studied sound production during territorial defence in captive painted gobies, Pomatoschistus pictus, and related acoustic parameters with male traits and the date of recording (Julian day, i. e., with {{the approach of the}} peak of the breeding season). Territorial males emitted drumming sounds during displays that involved darkening the chin and fins, spreading fins and quivering the body. Drums were trains of low frequency pulses (≈ 23 pulses) repeated every 27 ms and usually lasting under a second. Drums were produced in short sequences of sounds (bursts). All acoustic parameters differed significantly among males. Drum and burst duration, and drum number of pulses increased significantly with male size. Calling duration (including drum, burst duration and drum number of pulses) also increased significantly with Julian date and presented a high intra-male variability, suggesting that these parameters may also depend on the individual’s motivation.

40|$|In animals, {{colorful}} and conspicuous ornaments enhance individual attractiveness to potential mates, but are typically tempered {{by natural selection}} for crypsis and predator protection.

We examined the function of the conspicuous dark eyes that female <b>sand</b> <b>gobies</b> temporarily display during courtship by experimentally testing if males preferred to associate with females with artificially darkened eyes and if dark eyes are displayed during female aggression.

40|$|Female mating {{preferences}} are {{often based on}} more than one cue.

The females were given a binary choice between males that differed either in body size or size of their nest or both. We found that neither body size nor size of the nest alone affected male attractiveness, but together these 2 cues had a significant effect. Specifically, large males were more popular among females when they had a large nest than when they occupied a small nest.
