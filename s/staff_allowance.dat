50|$|On 6 June 2008, Spelman was {{the subject}} of {{controversy}} when it was suggested that for around twelve months from May 1997 she paid her child's nanny, Tina Haynes, from her parliamentary <b>staffing</b> <b>allowance,</b> contrary to the rule governing such allowances and fears of the misuse of them. Spelman claims that her nanny also acted as her constituency secretary and was paid from the public taxpayers' purse for this aspect of her further employment. Haynes confirms that occasionally she would answer phone calls and post documents but initially she denied such happenings when interviewed on BBC Two's Newsnight via telephone. The accusations came at a time when Conservative Party leader David Cameron had tasked Spelman with reviewing the use of parliamentary allowances by Conservative MPs and MEPs {{in the wake of the}} Derek Conway affair.The allegation against Spelman came shortly after two Conservative MEPs, Giles Chichester (Leader of the Conservatives in the EU Parliament) and Den Dover (Conservative Chief Whip in the EU Parliament), were forced to resign amid claims they misused their parliamentary allowances. However, Spelman was not urged to resign by party leader, David Cameron. She referred the matter pertaining to herself, her nanny and parliamentary funds to John Lyon, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards.|$|R

25|$|The Hong Kong AIDS Foundation is a {{registered}} charitable institution which depends on funding and donations. According to the annual reports of year 2002–2005, the Foundation received funding mainly from the AIDS Trust Fund, donations and income from the seed fund. The greatest contribution in terms of monetary value comes from the seed fund, in which the capital donation came from the Hong Kong SAR Government and The Hong Kong Jockey Club. The Foundation has a continued annual trend of current expenses exceeding current income and therefore relies on the income brought by the seed fund as well as investments which contributes to surpluses {{at the end of}} March throughout the years. The top three donors were AIDS Trust Fund (愛滋病信託基金委員會), Maryknoll China Service and Levi Strauss & Co.in the year 2004–2005. Also, the Foundation is exempted from Hong Kong profits tax as it is {{a registered}} charitable institution. The fund is mainly spent on various projects and activities, library development, education and publicity programs and other administrative costs like salaries for full-time staff. The percentage of expenses spent on <b>staff</b> and <b>allowances</b> has remained high throughout the years – 69% of the total amount of expenditure was allocated under the category of <b>staff</b> and <b>allowances</b> in the year 2005.

40|$|A key {{trend in}} home care {{in recent years}} in England has been {{movement}} away from "in-house" service provision by local government authorities (e. g., counties) towards models of service commissioning from independent providers. A national survey in 2003 identified that there were lower levels of satisfaction and perceptions of quality of care among older users of independent providers compared with in-house providers. This paper reports the results of a study that related service users' views of 121 providers with the characteristics of these providers. For the most part, characteristics associated with positive perceptions of quality were more prevalent among in-house providers. Multivariate analyses of independent providers suggested that aspects of the workforce itself, in terms of age and experience, provider perceptions of <b>staff</b> turnover, and <b>allowance</b> of travel time, were the most critical influences on service user experiences of service quality...|$|R

50|$|By {{the early}} 1970s Kane {{had been working}} for GCHQ for more than 25 years, having worked in almost every section of the organisation. In 1973, Kane {{uncovered}} fraud in GCHQ, concerned with subsistence <b>allowances.</b> <b>Staff</b> sent on training courses had been collecting their full allowance over a weekend, when they were already home. Fraud that Kane found in the GCHQ outpost of Little Sai Wan in Hong Kong concerned employees renting apartments at lower rates than their £600 rent allowance, then submitting false invoices for the higher amount, and sharing the difference with their Chinese landlords. Kane had worked in Hong Kong until 1976. Senior GCHQ officers were also involved in the fraud, and Kane found that senior management at GCHQ were not interested in his complaints. Kane believed that these activities could expose staff to blackmail by hostile intelligence agencies. A spy ring had already been uncovered in Little Sai Wan, with 150 people arrested for spying in Hong Kong from 1970-1976. His allegations also concerned the loss of secret documents and the collection of material from wastepaper baskets by Chinese cleaners, which he had established by intercepting communications between Chinese intelligence agents.|$|R
40|$|A {{clamping}} robot serving {{for several}} NC machines can recognize the best fit in manny blank parts. Forthermore, the shape information acquisition and pose measurment {{can be achieved}} by its computer vision system. The key question is that the clamping robot automatively choices the best fit part by statistical result of geometric dimension of all parts. The best fit part is the one that its length and its diameter are mostly proximate to the processing requirement. This choice method can save <b>staff,</b> reduce working <b>allowance,</b> and lessen finished cost. According to the shape information and position information, the robot can confirm the grab order, grab angle and finger joint distance. Firstly, the part image is smoothing by noise reduction technology, secondly, the feature points are extracted. The feature points present the information of the location of the mass center, the dip angle and diameter. Finally, the clamping robot can grab the most fit bar part by means of rotational motion, rectilinear motion, and finger open-close movement when the shape information and location information of the bar part have been confirmed. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

40|$|The study {{investigated}} impact of financial management on secondary school’s administration in Zone A Senatorial District of Benue State-Nigeria. Two research questions and two hypotheses guided the study. The literature was reviewed under conceptual frameworks which identified the gap {{to be filled}} by this study. It also provides a roadmap as {{to the type of}} design to be used. The descriptive survey design was adopted for the study. The population of the study comprised 1229 teachers from 90 secondary schools. 292 teachers were used for the study. A 10 -item structured four-point rating scale questionnaire constructed by the researcher titled impact of financial management on secondary school administration questionnaire (IFMSSAQ) was used for collection of data for the study. A pilot test on the instrument was conducted before taken to the field. Data obtained from the field study were then analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Means and standard deviations were used to answer the research questions while the chi-square (x 2) test of goodness of-fit was used to test the hypotheses at 0. 05 level of significance. It was found out that prompt payment of <b>staff</b> salaries and <b>allowances</b> significantly impact on the management of secondary schools.
