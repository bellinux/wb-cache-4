5|$|Napoleon's {{original}} death mask {{was created}} around 6 May, {{although it is}} not clear which doctor created it. In his will, he had asked to be buried {{on the banks of the}} Seine, but the British governor <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be buried on Saint Helena, in the Valley of the Willows.|$|E
25|$|After an {{independent}} {{investigation by the}} governor’s office, he was later ordered to pay back more than $25,000 of $44,000 to the state. Critics <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have been fired, as he conducted the personal travel with intent.|$|E

25|$|On August 12, 2006, Rahman {{lost the}} WBC heavyweight {{championship}} to rival Oleg Maskaev by 12th Round TKO in a mandatory {{defense of his}} title. Rahman was knocked down early in the 12th round and eventually stumbled to the mat. Rahman was then {{holding on to the}} ropes to stay on his feet. Maskaev landed a flurry of punches with Rahman unable to defend himself. The referee stopped the bout to save Rahman from further punishment. Afterwards he <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have followed his trainer's game plan.|$|E
25|$|Romney had job {{approval}} ratings around 50percent {{for most of}} his term, but they began to decline towards the end of his term. A March 2005 poll found that only 32percent felt Romney should be re-elected if he ran for a second term as governor (69percent of Republicans <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be re-elected, compared to 31percent of independents and 12percent of Democrats). Many in Massachusetts grew dissatisfied with Romney's frequent out-of-state travel and shift toward promoting socially conservative issues as he began to focus increasingly on national rather than state politics.|$|E

25|$|On 12 June 1974, {{he played}} against Hampshire at Taunton in a Benson & Hedges Cup (B Cup) quarter-final. Hampshire won the toss {{and decided to}} bat. They scored 182 all out with Botham taking two for 33 {{including}} the prize wicket of Barry Richards, bowled for 13. Botham was number nine in Somerset's batting order and came in with his team struggling at 113 for 7. Almost immediately, that became 113 for 8 and he had only the tailenders Hallam Moseley and Bob Clapp to support him. He was facing the West Indian fast bowler Andy Roberts who delivered a bouncer which {{hit him in the}} mouth. Despite heavy bleeding and the eventual loss of four teeth, Botham refused to leave the field and carried on batting. He hit two sixes and made 45*, enabling Somerset to win by one wicket. He won the Gold Award. Later, he <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have left the field but was full of praise for Moseley and Clapp.|$|E
500|$|Middleton was {{assigned}} {{as an assistant}} inspector general in the army headquarters in Manila. Here he listened to complaints as he travelled to various Army installations including Fort William McKinley and Corregidor. [...] Less than six months into his Philippine tour he received a telegram from President Smith renewing his offer of a job at LSU as the dean of administration with a salary of $5400 per year. Middleton {{was in the hospital}} undergoing testing for some heart irregularity when the telegram arrived, and he showed it to two other lieutenant colonels who were visiting him. One of them <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> take the offer, the salary being excellent. The other lieutenant colonel, Dwight Eisenhower, <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> stay in the army. Eisenhower had spent three years in Panama as an aide to General Fox Conner, who knew that the terms of the Treaty of Versailles were being ignored by Adolf Hitler and the Nazis, and who was certain another war was coming soon. Eisenhower reasoned that this was no time for an officer with Middleton's combat experience to be getting out of the Army.|$|E

Brand asked how the committee was supposed to obtain these goods. Eichmann <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> open negotiations with the Allies overseas and that Eichmann would arrange a travel permit. Brand suggested Istanbul, where another committee member had a Jewish Agency contact. He testified years later that on leaving the hotel he felt like a [...] "stark madman".|$|E

In fact, Mary handled the crisis quite well and kept a cool head [...] in public. In October, she {{travelled}} {{to the north of}} France to meet her brother-in-law, King Francis I of France, the second husband of her sister Eleanor. On October 23, they signed a treaty. Francis thereby promised Mary that he would not help those who rebelled against her, while the Queen promised to compensate certain French noblemen who lost their land in the Low Countries during the Italian Wars.|$|E
500|$|The Jewish Council in Budapest did {{hand the}} report out to individuals. A {{teenager}} in 1944, the Hungarian biologist George Klein {{was working for}} them as a junior secretary in their offices in Síp Street. One day in late May or early June, his boss, Dr. Zoltán Kohn, a rabbi, told him that two young Slovak Jews had escaped {{from one of the}} major camps and had written a report. He gave Klein a carbon copy in Hungarian, and <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> tell only his closest family and friends; otherwise he had to promise to keep it a secret. Reading the report, he felt [...] "a strange mixture of nausea and a kind of intellectual satisfaction": ...|$|E
500|$|On June 6, 1990, {{before a}} Yankees–Red Sox game at Fenway Park, the Yankees fired Bucky Dent as their manager, making Fenway Park {{the scene of}} his worst moment as manager, {{although}} he had his greatest moment as a player there. Red Sox fans felt retribution as Dent was fired on their field, while players on the Yankees, including former Red Sox catcher Rick Cerone and Mattingly felt Dent {{was used as a}} scapegoat. Dan Shaughnessy criticized Steinbrenner for firing Dent in Boston and <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> [...] "have waited until the Yankees got to Baltimore" [...] to fire Dent. He said that [...] "if Dent had been fired in Seattle or Milwaukee, this would have been just another event in an endless line of George's jettisons. But it happened in Boston and the nightly news had its hook." [...] He also said that [...] "the firing was only special because...it's the first time a Yankee manager...was purged on the ancient Indian burial grounds of the Back Bay." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{critical}} {{recognition and}} renown of Astral Weeks came to overshadow Morrison's subsequent work, {{as well as}} Morrison himself. According to biographer Johnny Rogan, his recording career was [...] "all too often crystallized in a single moment. Like the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds, Astral Weeks was perceived as a one-off whose critical standing allowed little discussion for other equally fascinating musical forays that followed." [...] Morrison felt annoyed by the retrospective acclaim and claims about the record's significance. In agreement with Logan's original criticism, he later <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have [...] "changed the arrangements because the arrangements are too samey ... four or five other songs {{should have had a}} change of mood." [...] Merenstein, on the other hand, still admires the album: [...] "To this day it gives me pain to hear it. Pain is the wrong word—I'm so moved by it." [...] In 2001, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, having shipped 500,000 copies in the US. Music historian Andrew Ford said the album's commercial performance, much like its musical aesthetic, is similar to classical music: [...] "Neither instant nor evanescent: Astral Weeks will sell as many copies this year as it did in 1968 and has every year in between".|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} Island {{in the second}} season finale [...] "Live Together, Die Alone", Michael was {{supposed}} to return in the season three finale, but Perrineau was filming the pilot of Demons, so was unable to return. Instead he returned in the seventh episode of season four, [...] "Ji Yeon". His return {{was meant to be}} announced during Losts slot at the 2007 Comic-Con International, however there were complaints at the Television Critics Association Press Tour when ABC's President of Entertainment Stephen McPherson commented that [...] "some big announcements" [...] would be made at the Lost panel. Some journalists felt that any announcements should be made to them at the press meeting, rather than at a fan convention. After numerous reporters asked about what would be announced, Lost producer Damon Lindelof was contacted, and he gave permission for McPherson to say Harold Perrineau would be returning to Lost. At Comic-Con, Lindelof confirmed Perrineau would be back as a cast member, not just for a flashback. Lost producer Carlton Cuse said [...] "Michael's story is for us one of the most becoming storylines on the show because here's a character who ... undertook some very extreme actions in order to basically get his son off the Island, and then when he sailed off in that boat I think everyone was very curious about what happened to him, what is his fate ... we really feel that Michael's story will be a really compelling part of the season." [...] Perrineau was disappointed that he was brought back to the show only to be killed, and that Michael does not get a chance to reunite with his son, Walt, saying, [...] "there are all these questions about how [...] respond to black people on the show ... Walt just winds up being another fatherless child. It plays into a really big, weird stereotype and, being a black person myself, that wasn't so interesting." [...] Cuse responded [...] "We pride ourselves on having a very racially diverse cast. It's painful when any actor's storyline ends on the show. Harold is a fantastic actor whose presence added enormously to Lost". Perrineau later <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have thought before making a racial comment, and although he felt like that, he never discussed the matter with the producers. Perrineau said that although he would be happy to return to Lost, he would have to know what the storyline would be.|$|E
2500|$|However, in a {{conversation}} in Karachi, Younis opened his idea about the retirement, where he can extend his international career, {{but only if the}} Pakistan board and team needs him to do so. The news sudden many of the global fans, and some <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> retire with the dignity and some <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> extend the career for two more years. With that, on 23 April 2017, Younis confirmed his retirement at the end of West Indies tour with Misbah, by citing he will retire even if he scores [...] "a hundred in every innings of every match against West Indies".|$|E

2500|$|The Marbury v. Madison {{decision}} {{expanded the}} power of the Supreme Court in general, by announcing that the 1789 law which gave the Court jurisdiction in this case was unconstitutional. [...] Marbury thus lost his case, which the Court <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have won, but, in explaining its inability to provide Marbury the remedy it said he deserved, the Court established the principle of judicial review, i.e., the power to declare a law unconstitutional.|$|E
