The lesser kudu and the gerenuk might compete for evergreen species in the dry season. However, unlike the gerenuk, the lesser kudu rarely prefers Acacia species and does not stand on its hindlegs while feeding. The lesser kudu does not have a great requirement for water, and can browse in arid environments. It eats succulent plants, such as the wild sisal, <b>Sansevieria,</b> and Euphorbia species in the dry season, and drinks water when sources are available.|$|E

Its hot, dry climate is suitable for Plumeria and Bougainvillea cultivars in the outer crater, kiawe (Prosopis pallida) and koa haole (Leucaena leucocephala) trees, and four major collections organized by region (Africa, the Americas, Hawaii, Madagascar). Other collections include adeniums, alluaudias, aloes, baobabs, cacti, euphorbias, palms, and <b>sansevierias,</b> as well as a native grove of wiliwili trees (Erythrina sandwicensis). A loop trail (2 miles) runs through the collections. They have About 500 trees and 200 species of trees.|$|R

50|$|There {{is great}} {{variation}} within the genus, and species range from succulent desert {{plants such as}} <b>Sansevieria</b> pinguicula to thinner leafed tropical plants such as <b>Sansevieria</b> trifasciata. Plants often form dense clumps from a spreading rhizome or stolons.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>Sansevieria</b> species seldom set seed, and {{commercial}} {{species such as}} <b>Sansevieria</b> trifasciata are typically grown using micropropagation. However, since S. pinguicula grows so slowly, micropropagation is unprofitable. Therefore, vegetative propagation by division or by leaf cutting is the preferred method.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sansevieria</b> ehrenbergii (blue <b>sansevieria,</b> sword <b>sansevieria,</b> oldupai, or East African wild sisal) is a {{flowering}} plant which grows in northeastern Africa from Libya south to Tanzania, Oman, and Saudi Arabia. It occurs notably in proliferation along the Olduvai Gorge in northern Tanzania. Mature leaves are dark green and usually range between 0.5 and 1.5 m {{in length and}} 2.45 and 8.0 cm in width. The plant grows in tight clusters and in close proximity amongst itself.|$|E

[...] <b>Sansevieria</b> use the crassulacean acid metabolism process, which absorbs carbon dioxide and releases oxygen at night. This purportedly makes them suitable bedroom plants. However, since the leaves are potentially poisonous if ingested, <b>Sansevieria</b> is not usually recommended for children's bedrooms.|$|E

In nature, <b>Sansevieria</b> flowers are pollinated by moths, but both flowering and fruiting is erratic and few seeds are produced. The raceme of <b>Sansevieria</b> {{is derived from the}} apical meristem and a flowered shoot will no longer produce new leaves. Unlike plants such as agave which die after flowering, a bloomed <b>Sansevieria</b> shoot will simply cease to produce new leaves.

50|$|The {{leaves of}} <b>Sansevieria</b> are {{typically}} {{arranged in a}} rosette around the growing point, although some species are distichous. There is great variation in foliage form within the genus. All species {{can be divided into}} one of two basic categories based on their leaves: hard leaved and soft leaved species. Typically, hard leaved <b>Sansevieria</b> originate from arid climates, while the soft leaved species originate from tropical and subtropical regions.Hard leaved <b>Sansevieria</b> have a number of adaptations for surviving dry regions. These include thick, succulent leaves for storing water and thick leaf cuticles for reducing moisture loss. These leaves may be cylindrical to reduce surface area and are generally shorter than those of their soft leafed tropical counterparts, which are wide and strap-like.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Sansevieria</b> cylindrica has striped, elongate, smooth, greenish-gray subcylindrical leaves. They {{are up to}} 3 cm {{diameter}} and grow up to 2 m above soil. The Spear <b>Sansevieria</b> grows fan-shaped, with its stiff leaves growing from a basal rosette. The species is interesting in having subcylindical instead of strap-shaped leaves caused by a failure to express genes which would cause the cylindrical bud to differentiate dorsoventrally or produce a distinctive and familiar top and bottom surface to the leaf blade. [...] The 3 cm greenish-white tubular flowers are tinged with pink. The species is drought-tolerant and in captivity requires water only about once every other week during the growing season. The species was described by Wenceslas Bojer in 1837. <b>Sansevieria</b> cylindrica received its name from a competition in a Dutch national newspaper. It is popular as an ornamental plant as {{it is easy to}} culture and take care of in a home if given bright sunlight and other required resources.|$|E
