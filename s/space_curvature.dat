5000|$|The {{geodetic}} {{effect is}} an effect caused by space-time being [...] "curved" [...] by {{the mass of}} the Earth. A gyroscope's axis when parallel transported around the Earth in one complete revolution does not end up pointing in exactly the same direction as before. The angle [...] "missing" [...] may be thought of as the amount the gyroscope [...] "leans over" [...] into the slope of the space-time curvature. A more precise explanation for the <b>space</b> <b>curvature</b> part of the geodetic precession is obtained by using a nearly flat cone to model the <b>space</b> <b>curvature</b> of the Earth's gravitational field. Such a cone is made by cutting out a thin [...] "pie-slice" [...] from a circle and gluing the cut edges together.

50|$|The general {{method of}} {{approach}} {{to resolve these}} complications follows two steps. First, the constraint of perfect space-filling is relaxed by allowing for <b>space</b> <b>curvature.</b> An ideal, unfrustrated, structure is defined in this curved space.

The final structure {{is a mixture of}} ordered regions, where the local order {{is similar to that of}} the template, and defects arising from the embedding. Among the possible defects, disclinations play an important role.|$|E

5000|$|Quantum {{slipstream}} was a starship drive used in two {{episodes of}} the science fiction television series Star Trek: Voyager. It {{first appeared in the}} season 4 finale, [...] "Hope and Fear". Similar to the Borg transwarp conduits, the slipstream is a narrowly focused, directed field that is initiated by manipulating the fabric of the space-time continuum at the quantum level using the starship's navigational deflector array. It works by focusing a quantum field through a deflector dish to generate massive changes in local <b>space</b> <b>curvature.</b> This creates a subspace tunnel, which is projected ahead of the vessel. Once a ship has entered this tunnel, the forces inside propel it at incredible speed. To maintain the slipstream, a ship has to constantly modify the quantum field with its deflector dish; however, the calculations involved are too complicated, and the time available too short for 24th-century Starfleet computer technology. When this technology was discovered by the crew of the lost and stranded USS Voyager, it was hoped this could be used to allow the starship to travel at even greater speeds: the first test of this drive allowed the ship to travel 300 light years in minutes.|$|E
