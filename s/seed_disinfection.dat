Ideally, pathogen-free or pathogen-/disease-resistant planting material is desirable, but this situation is not always possible on a practical basis. For most bacterial pathogens, resistance is not available in cultivated hosts, and production of pathogen-free planting material requires strict certification schemes via several routes. These include (i) indexing, with subsequent removal of infected/contaminated material from the production chain; (ii) meristem and other tissue culture production systems; (iii) thermo- or chemotherapy; (iv) plant or <b>seed</b> surface <b>disinfection</b> for epiphytic bacterial pathogens; (v) avoidance or decontamination of contaminated production factors such as substrate, soil or irrigation water.

This research was conducted to study the effects of seed quality on seedling emergence rate, seedling number and yielding capacity. The study comprised three-year field experiments conducted during 20072009, established at three sites: Jokioinen, Nousiainen and Ylistaro. Spring barley cultivars Saana (2007) and Annabell (2008 - 2009) were sown at rate of 500 germinating seeds m- 2. Five seed lots were included as treatments: farm saved seed (FSS); downgraded seed 2. 7 mm); upgraded seed > 2. 7 mm with disinfection (FSS> 2. 7 mm + dis); and commercial certified <b>seed</b> with <b>disinfection</b> (CCS). Up- and down-graded seed lots (FSS 2. 7 mm, and FSS> 2. 7 mm + dis) all originated from the FSS. Seedling emergence rate was measured from the time when coleoptiles started to break through the soil surface. The number of seedlings (3 × 1 m row per plot) was recorded at five-day intervals four times from the same rows. Plots were harvested at physiological maturity and grain yield (kg ha- 1), hectolitre weight (HLW, kg) single grain weight (SGW, mg) and grain protein content (%) were recorded. Seed lots of CCS and FSS> 2. 7 mm + dis enhanced seedling emergence rate and increased the number of plants compared with other treatments. These two seed lots also produced the highest grain yield and had the lowest grain protein. Seed quality had an apparent effect on plant stand establishment and grain yield. A seed lot effect was evident despite identical targeted sowing rates that took into account germination rate and seed weight. Therefore, differences in seedling emergence and yielding capacity were likely outcomes of variation in seed vigour among the five treatments. ...|$|R

Therefore a search was made for disinfectants, penetrating the seeds, using ascochyta-infected seeds for tests. The most effective compounds were the newly discovered antibiotics rimocidin and pimaricin, products of Streptomyces spp. They penetrated the seeds and eliminated internal fungus without impairing germination. An 18 -h soaking reduced the percentage of seeds with viable mycelium from 80 to less than 1 %. Dry or almost dry treatment was less effective. A further drawback of these antibiotics was the reversible loss of fungicidal activity inside plant tissue through adsorption, and inactivation by UV radiation. Rimocidin and pimaricin were nevertheless of interest because of their selectivity, being highly toxic to most fungi, but hardly toxic to bacteria and higher plants. Remarkable also was ready uptake by plants and seeds despite their large complex molecules. A new aspect of the parasitism of this fungus was that the fungus was often present in plant parts or whole plants without symptoms. Rarely the fungus was even isolated from seeds, harvested from plants without symptoms. It was also observed that during ripening of the pods many pycnidia appeared outside the limited brown-edged spots, typical for this disease. <p/...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was amid to detect and {{identify}} seed borne fungi associated with soybean seeds and to assess the effect of surface disinfection time on percent of seed infection. A single variety of soybean “Clark ” of two batches obtained from Jimma agriculture research center {{was used for the}} study. Seed borne fungi associated with soybean were detected using agar plate and blotter technique. Four disinfection times (0 minute, 2 minute, 4 minute and 6 minute) were tested in the study. A total of five fungi species comprising four genera namely Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Fusarium spp., Penicillium sp. and Rhizopus spp. were isolated from soybean seed. Among which Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger were found to be the most prevalent. The study also indicate that time of <b>seed</b> <b>disinfection</b> has significant effect (p> 0. 05) on percent of seed infection. The highest seed infection was observed in the un-disinfected seed lots while the lowest seed infection was recorded in the plate containing seed disinfected with longer time 6 minute. However the difference in disinfection time has no relation with the germination potential of the grain. Generally, the present study reviled that a wide range of pathogens are associated with soybean seed, and the time of surface disinfection can considerably affect the percent of seed infection. Moreover, extensive similar researches needs to be conducted to develop safe and effective management tools to tackle problems related with seed borne fungi...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: In Ethiopia, O. abyssinica has varies {{economic}} importance. However, conventional propagation {{methods of}} O. abyssinica are generally inefficient {{due to their}} low multiplication rate, time consuming, labor intensive, and too costly. Aims: The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a protocol for micropropagation of O. abyssinica through seed culture. Methodology: For <b>seed</b> <b>disinfection,</b> NaOCl of 3, 4, and 5 % concentration for 15, 20, and 25 min exposure time were tested. MS medium augmented with BAP or KN at different concentrations was used for shoot initiation and multiplication. For in vitro rooting, ½MS medium supplemented with IBA or NAA at different concentrations was used. Data were subjected to ANOVA and mean values were compared using LSD at a 5 % of probability level. Results: Seeds disinfected in 4. 0 % NaOCl for 25 minutes gave 71. 6 % clean explants and 23. 45 % germinated explants. In shoot initiation experiment all viable seeds were able to proliferate in 5 - 7 days of culturing in all treatments; and 4. 0 mg dm^- 3 BAP was found better in maximum shoot initiation percent (86. 67) and mean number of shoots per explants (4. 8). Similarly, in shoot multiplication 4. 0 mg dm^- 3 BAP was effective in highest mean number of shoot (11. 33) and multiplication rate (3. 77). The maximum rooting percent (93. 33) and maximum root number per clump (9. 42) were found at 8. 0 mg dm^- 3 IBA. Finally, the survival rate of plantlets in greenhouse condition was found to be 91. 67 % after 30 days of acclimatization. Conclusion: The study enables to develop an effective and applicable protocol for O. abyssinica micropropagtion...|$|E
40|$|Mediterranean and West European pre-modern {{agriculture}} (agriculture before 1600) was {{by necessity}} ‘organic agriculture’. Crop protection is {{part and parcel}} of this agriculture, with weed control in the forefront. Crop protection is embedded in the medieval agronomy text books but specialised sections do occur. Weeds, insects and diseases are described but identification in modern terms is not easy. The pre-modern ‘Crop Portfolio’ is well filled, certainly in the Mediterranean area. The medieval ‘Pest Portfolio’ differs from the modern one because agriculture then was a Low External Input Agriculture, and because the proportion of cultivated to non-cultivated land was drastically lower than today. The pre-modern ‘Control Portfolio’ is surprisingly rich, both in preventive and interventive measures. Prevention was by risk management, intensive tillage, and careful storage. Intervention was mechanical and chemical. Chemical intervention used natural substances such as sulphur, pitch, and ‘botanicals’. Some fifty plant species are mentioned in a crop protection context. Though application methods look rather modern they are typically low-tech. Among them are <b>seed</b> <b>disinfection,</b> spraying, dusting, fumigation, grease banding, wound care, and hand-picking but also scarification, now outdated. The reality of pest outbreaks and other damages is explored as to frequency, intensity, and extent. Information on the practical use of the recommended treatments is scanty. If applied, their effectiveness remains enigmatic. Three medieval agronomists are at the heart of this book, but historical developments in crop protection from early Punic, Greek, and Roman authors to the first modern author are outlined. The readership of these writers was the privileged class of landowners but hints pointing to the exchange of ideas between them and the common peasant were found. Consideration is given to the pre-modern reasoning in matters of crop protection. Comparison of pre-modern crop protection and its counterpart in modern organic agriculture is difficult because of drastic changes in the relation between crop areas and non-crop areas, and because of the great difference in yield levels then and now, with several associated differences...|$|E
