50|$|The {{defining}} {{characteristics of}} a vulnerable plaque include {{but are not limited}} to: a thin fibrous cap, large lipid-rich necrotic core, increased plaque inflammation, positive vascular remodeling, increased vasa-vasorum neovascularization, and intra-plaque hemorrhage. These characteristics together with the usual hemodynamic pulsating expansion during systole and elastic recoil contraction during diastole contribute to a high mechanical <b>stress</b> <b>zone</b> on the fibrous cap of the atheroma, making it prone to rupture. Increased hemodynamic stress, e.g. increased blood pressure, especially pulse pressure (systolic blood pressure vs. diastolic blood pressure difference), correlates with increased rates of major cardiovascular events associated with exercise, especially exercise beyond levels the individual does routinely.

The effects of genetic and non-genetic factors viz., sire, parity, period of calving and age group at first calving were found non-significant on pregnancy rate. The effect of THI was found significant (p< 0. 001) on pregnancy rate of Murrah buffaloes calved for first time and overall pregnancy rate. The threshold THI affecting the pregnancy rate was identified as THI 75. The months from October to March showed THI< 75 and considered as non heat <b>stress</b> <b>zone</b> (NHSZ), while months from April to September were determined as heat <b>stress</b> <b>zone</b> (HSZ) with THI≥ 75.

The crack growth rates are found to be substantially lower as the crack tip moved through the residual <b>stress</b> <b>zone</b> induced by cold expansion. The TSA results demonstrated that the crack tip plastic zones were reduced in size by the presence of the residual compressive stresses induced by cold expansion. The crack tip plastic zones were found to be insignificant in size in comparison to the residual <b>stress</b> <b>zone</b> resulting from cold expansion, which implied that they were unlikely to have had a notable impact on the surrounding residual stresses induced by cold expansion. The residual stress distributions measured along the direction of crack growth, using SXRD, showed no signs of any significant stress relaxation or redistribution, which validates the conclusions drawn from the TSA data.

The International Association of Drilling Contractors (IADC) classification {{was used to}} design 14 types of profiles. The formation model was built, with given bit size, formation properties, meshing method and boundary conditions, etc. Moreover, the pseudo-static state and mass scaling were used to reduce the simulation time and increase the simulation accuracy.

When the gauge height decreased, the high <b>stress</b> <b>zone</b> turned from the nose and center to the gauge zone. For the non-common bit profiles, the convex bit produced larger high stress field, and the pilot section bottom of bicentre bits had concentrated stress. Fractures were created in the gauge zones and noses, and the bits with larger cone height and gauge height induced longer vertical fractures.

The foundation is stiffer the rupture under front plane is more clearly expressed. The typical macrofracture mode is represented in Fig.  8 a. The failure starts at the front (loaded) plane: the rupture fracture (9) is extended under the back plane. The final failure takes place along shear fracture (10) at the back plane.

40|$|Generally, {{knowledge}} of stress redistribution around the longwall panel causes {{a better understanding}} of the mechanisms that lead to ground failure, especially to rock bursts. In this paper, passive seismic velocity tomography is used to demonstrate the state of stress around the longwall mining panel. The mining-induced microseismic events were recorded by mounting an array of receivers on the surface, above the active panel. To determine the location of seismic events and execute the process of tomography, double difference method is employed as a local earthquake tomography. Since passive sources are used, the ray coverage is insufficient to achieve the quality images required. The wave velocity is assumed to be the regionalized variable and it is therefore estimated in a denser network, by using geostatistical estimation method. Subsequently, the three dimensional images of wave velocity are created and are sliced into the coal seam. These images clearly illustrate the <b>stressed</b> <b>zones</b> that they are appropriately in compliance with the theoretical models. Such compliance is particularly apparent in the front abutment pressure and the side abutment pressure near the tailgate entry. Movements of the <b>stressed</b> <b>zones</b> along the advancing face are also evident.
