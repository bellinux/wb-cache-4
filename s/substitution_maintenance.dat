40|$|Objective: In Malaysia, opioid {{abuse is}} an {{acknowledged}} problem with severe health and economic repercussions. Until recently, drug addicts were mainly criminalised and forcefully rehabilitated in correctional facilities. However, the high relapse rates of this approach, {{coupled with the}} high rates of blood borne infections among drug users, led to increasing acceptance of a healthcare-based approach in the rehabilitation of drug addicts. Methadone was among the medications introduced as <b>substitution</b> <b>maintenance</b> therapy in 2005 and Universiti Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) is a centre for MMT.

A case-control study was conducted {{at a hospital in}} Coimbra, Portugal, between 2001 and 2014. Drug-dependent pregnant women (n= 236) were compared with a control group of low risk women (n= 228) in terms of maternal characteristics, obstetric history, pregnancy complications, and labor details. Factors that influenced the mode of delivery were determined. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS v. 23. 0 (IBM Corp.). p values < 0. 05 were considered statistically significant. Results. Drug-dependent women presented a lower rate of cesarean delivery (18. 2 versus 28. 9 %, p= 0. 006). After adjusting for the factors that were significantly related to the mode of delivery, drug dependency influenced the rate of cesarean section (β= 0. 567; 95 % CI = 0. 328 – 0. 980). Within the drug-dependent group, the mode of delivery was significantly related to previous cesarean or vaginal delivery (p= 0. 008 and p< 0. 001, resp.) and fetal presentation (p< 0. 001), but not with the type of drug, route of administration, or <b>substitution</b> <b>maintenance</b> therapy.

40|$|Methadone {{is widely}} used as a {{replacement}} for illicit opioid use such as heroin in medically-supported opioid <b>substitution</b> <b>maintenance</b> programmes. Two other drugs have been used to help reduce illicit opioid use, specifically buprenorphine and LAAM (levo-alpha-acetylmethadol). LAAM is not used in current clinical practice. Buprenorphine is currently used and can reduce illicit opioid use compared with placebo, although it is less effective than methadone. Buprenorphine is an opioid drug that is not as potent as heroin and methadone, although the effects of buprenorphine may last longer. Buprenorphine can be taken once every two days. The trials include different formulations of buprenorphine: sublingual solution, sublingual tablets, combined buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablet and an implant. Key results The review of trials found that buprenorphine at high doses (16 mg) can reduce illicit opioid use effectively compared with placebo, and buprenorphine at any dose studied retains people in treatment better than placebo. Buprenorphine appears to be less effective than methadone in retaining people in treatment, if prescribed in a flexible dose regimen or at a fixed and low dose (2 - 6 mg per day). Buprenorphine prescribed at fixed doses (above 7 mg per day) was not different from methadone prescribed at fixed doses (40 mg or more per day) in retaining people in treatment or in suppression of illicit opioid use...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Substitution</b> <b>maintenance</b> {{treatment}} {{is considered to}} be one of the most effective options for the management of heroin or other opioid drug addiction. It has expanded substantially in the European Union in the last decade. It is part of recognised medical practice approved by competent authorities. Research has shown that methadone maintenance {{treatment is}} more effective than detoxification programmes in promoting retention in drug treatment and abstinence from illicit drug use. The death rate of people with opioid dependence under methadone maintenance treatment is one third to one fourth the rate of those not under treatment. IDUs who do not enter treatment are up to six times more likely to become infected with HIV and fifteen times more with hepatitis C than injectors who enter and remain under treatment. Criminal behaviour is strongly reduced. Every Euro invested in the programmes may yield a return of between four and seven Euros in reduced drug-related crime, criminal justice costs and theft alone, and when including savings related to health care, total savings can exceed costs by a ratio of 1 : 12. Conclusions: Since 1995 eighteen Centres for the Prevention and Treatment of Drug Addiction have been established in the Republic of Slovenia. Centre for Treatment of Drug Addicts at the University Hospital of Psychiatry in Ljubljana was established in 2003. Substitution treatment with methadone was introduced in Slovenia in 1990, buprenorphine was registered in 2004 and SR morphine in 2005. Since 2007 buprenorphine-naloxone combination has been used as well. In 2008 there were 4429 patients treated in these outpatient centres, 3332 of them with substitution medications and additionally 542 in prisons. At the Centre for treatment of drug addiction 790 patients were treated in the outpatient clinic, 174 as inpatients and 70 in the day hospital...|$|E

Quality of evidence: Medline and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched. Consensus reports, guidelines published, and other authoritative sources were also included in this review. Apart from expert guidelines, data included in this review constitute level 1 evidence. Findings: Bup/nx is a partial µ-opioid agonist combined with the opioid antagonist naloxone in a 4 : 1 ratio. It has a lower abuse potential, carries less stigma, and allows for more flexibility than methadone. Bup/nx is indicated for both inpatient and ambulatory medically assisted withdrawal (acute detoxification) and long-term <b>substitution</b> treatment (<b>maintenance)</b> of patients who have a mild-to-moderate physical dependence. A stepwise long-term substitution treatment with regular monitoring and follow-up assessment is usually preferred, as it has better outcomes in reducing illicit opioid use, minimizing concomitant risks such as human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C transmission, retaining patients in treatment and improving global functioning. Conclusion: Bup/nx is safe and effective for opioid detoxification and substitution treatment. Its unique pharmaceutical properties make it particularly suitable for office-based maintenance treatment of opioid-use disorder.

40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} whether buprenorphine {{is more effective}} than clondine and other symptomatic medications in managing ambulatory heroin withdrawal. Design: Open label. prospective randomized controlled trial examining withdrawal and 4 -week postwithdrawal outcomes on intention-to-treat. Setting: Two specialist, out-patient drug treatment centres in inner city Melbourne and Sydney, Australia. Participants: One hundred and fourteen dependent heroin users were recruited. Participants were 18 yea rs or over. and with no significant other drug dependence, medical or psychiatric conditions or recent methadone treatment. One hundred and one (89 %) participants completed a day 8 research interview examining withdrawal outcomes, and 92 (81 %) completed day 35 research interview examining postwithdrawal outcomes. Interventions: Participants randomized to control (n = 56) (up to 8 days or clonidine and other symptomatic medications) or experimental (n = 58) (up to 5 days of buprenorphine) withdrawal groups. Following the 8 -day withdrawal episode, participants could self-select from range of postwithdrawal options (naltrexone, <b>substitution</b> <b>maintenance</b> or counselling). Measurements: Retention in withdrawal: heroin use during withdrawl: and retention in drug treatment 4 weeks after withdrawal. Secondary outcomes: Withdrawal severity: adverse events, and heroin use in the postwithdrawal period. Findings: The experimental group had better treatment retention at day 8 (86 % versus 57 %, P = 0. 001, 95 % CI for numbers needed to treat (NNT) = 3 - 8) and day 35 (62 % versus 39 %, P = 0. 02, 95 % CI for NNT = 4 - 18) : used heroin on fewer days during the withdralwal programlme (2. 6 ± 2. 5 versus 4. 5 ± 2. 3.

40|$|The most {{rapid growth}} rate of the {{epidemic}} process of HIV in Ukraine is observed among injection drug users (IDUs). <b>Substitution</b> <b>maintenance</b> therapy (SMT) with methadone and buprenorphine significantly increases the patients’ maintenance in treatment due to increased adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), which is a mandatory component of comprehensive medical care for HIV-infected. The aim of our {{study was to determine}} the impact of SMT on the efficiency of ART for IDUs with HIV infection compared with patients infected through sexual contact. Materials and methods. The study included 95 patients with HIV that were divided into three groups. The first group included 33 IDUs patients who were treated with SMT. The second group included 32 IDUs patients without SMT. The third group included 30 patients with the sexual way of HIV infection. After the inclusion into the research all the patients were prescribed ART. Immunological examination and determination of viral load were carried out before the appointment of ART after 6 and 12 months during the treatment. Results and discussion. During the treatment with ART harder immunosuppression was recorded in the second group of patients, while the average viral load did not statistically differ in the research groups. After 6 months of the treatment the increase (P < 0. 05) of the number of CD 4 -lymphocytes was noted in all groups of patients, and the proportion of patients with full suppression of HIV in the first and the third groups was higher than in the second group, however this difference was not significant. After 12 months of the treatment, there was a further increase (P < 0. 05) of the absolute number of CD 4 -lymphocytes in the research groups, and in the virological efficiency of ART assessing a significantly higher (P < 0. 01) percentage was found in patients of the first and the third groups, who achieved the full viral suppression. It should be noted, that within 6 - 12 months of the treatment there was a decrease of the proportion of patients with virological efficiency of ART in the second group of patients. Conclusions. Immunological and virological efficiency of ART in the patients with HIV-infection IDUs received SMT after 12 months of the treatment didn`t differ from the group of patients infected by the sexual contact. There is an increase in the number of cases with virological failure among the patients with HIV IDUs who were not receiving SMT within 6 to 12 month of the treatment. Enabling patients to SMT programs increases the efficiency of the clinical examination and allows beginning of ART in time without severe immunosuppression, so it significantly improves the immunological efficiency of ART. ...|$|E
40|$|DNA {{damage and}} {{telomere}} dysfunction shorten organismal lifespan. Here {{we show that}} oral glucose administration at advanced age increases health and lifespan of telomere dysfunctional mice. The study reveals that energy consumption increases in telomere dysfunctional cells resulting in enhanced glucose metabolism both in glycolysis and in the tricarboxylic acid cycle at organismal level. In ageing telomere dysfunctional mice, normal diet provides insufficient amounts of glucose thus leading to impaired energy homeostasis, catabolism, suppression of IGF- 1 /mTOR signalling, suppression of mitochondrial biogenesis and tissue atrophy. A glucose-enriched diet reverts these defects by activating glycolysis, mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative glucose metabolism. The beneficial effects of glucose substitution on mitochondrial function and glucose metabolism are blocked by mTOR inhibition but mimicked by IGF- 1 application. Together, these results provide the first experimental evidence that telomere dysfunction enhances the requirement of glucose <b>substitution</b> for the <b>maintenance</b> of energy homeostasis and IGF- 1 /mTOR-dependent mitochondrial biogenesis in ageing tissues...|$|R
40|$|Summary : Heroin (or diacetylmorphine), a {{depressant}} of {{the nervous}} central system, is a semi-synthetic opiate. Its main adverse effect, respiratory depression, can lead to death, especially after an intravenous injection. By loss of tolerance, an overdose can be lethal following heroin use {{after a period of}} abstinence (voluntary or not). Mortality rate among heroin users is between 1 and 3 %. Addiction, following a regular and continuous use, occurs in {{less than a quarter of}} persons who ever tried heroine. Heroin addicts often present with different problems (for instance, a criminal behaviour), without any obvious link with addiction. For a fraction of the addicts, addiction becomes a chronic relapsing disease, requiring a long term <b>maintenance</b> <b>substitution</b> therapy. However, relapses and sometimes continuous heroin use are frequent. For treatment resistant and severe heroin addicts, heroinassisted treatment can be a solution. Despite the numerous available therapies, heroin is considered to be the drug with the most negative effects on the user. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the tree species population dynamics in a fragment of Montane Araucaria Forest, in the municipality of Lages, Santa Catarina (SC) state, along a period of four years (2008 - 2012). For this, for all species sampled, in 50 permanent plots of 10 x 20 m, the regeneration guilds [pioneer (P), light-demanding climax (LDC) and shade-tolerant climax (STC) ] and dynamics rates were determined (mortality, recruitment, loss and gain in basal area, net change in abundance and basal area). The existence of significant association between regeneration guilds and dynamic rates was verified by chisquare tests, applied to contingency tables. Changes in relative participation of regeneration guilds between years were analyzed using proportion tests. In 2008, 87 species were found (P: 9, LDC: 64, STC: 11, nonclassified: 3), 1. 841 ind. ha- 1 and 36. 17 m². ha- 1. In 2012, 86 species (P: 9, LDC: 63, STC: 11, non-classified: 3), 1. 882 ind. ha- 1 and 39. 17 m². ha- 1 were observed. Most species showed gains in basal area. Among the most abundant, {{the highest rates of}} recruitment and basal area gain were observed for Banara tomentosa Clos, with, respectively, 5. 43 %. year- 1 and 6. 08 %. year- 1, and the highest rates of mortality and basal area loss occurred for Zanthoxylum rhoifolium Lam., with, respectively, 7. 75 %. year- 1 and 4. 74 %. year- 1. No significant association between the dynamics patterns and regeneration guilds was observed, whose relative participations in the community, during the evaluated period, were constants. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that the forest fragment {{is in the process of}} structural instability, indicated by the increment of the number of individuals and basal area, and floristic-successional stability, due to the low floristic <b>substitution</b> and <b>maintenance</b> of the relative importance of the regeneration guilds, along the evaluated period...|$|R
40|$|The French {{system for}} drug <b>substitution,</b> or <b>maintenance</b> treatment, {{established}} in 1996, {{differs from the}} often strict conditions attached to methadone clinics in other countries. Because of the predominant role of general practitioners and the flexible prescription rules for Subutex((R)) in France, {{the relationship between the}} physician and the drug user becomes a central element in the treatment. This article deals with the expectations that these users have of the physician, and their perception of his or her attitude towards them. In order to identify possible reasons for the absence of treatment compliance and of Subutex((R)) misuse, it focuses on the users' assessment of the physician's response to the problems they report. This study, based on a diversified convenience sample of 28 persons (19 men, 9 women) in treatment, showed 4 patterns of relationships between physicians and users, which differed in their focus: (1) closely focused on the posology of the prescription; (2) compliance with the prescribed regimen is the main issue in a relationship dominated by the physician; (3) an alliance between the physician and the user who is acknowledged as a person, and (4) a instrumental solely {{on the part of the}} user, who comes to procure a free, legal drug from a doctor's office. In all four case types, users had difficulty reporting other drug use or intravenous Subutex((R)) injection within this relationship, in which the stigma attached to drug dependence seems to reappear. Moreover, the lack of clarity about the treatment objectives and the time frame of the consultation limits the users' ability to integrate the treatment into their lives and to commit themselves to it. The heterogeneity and fragility of the users' situations, and the treatment objectives require regular assessment during contact with the physician. This constant reappraisal of the situation with the physician should help to optimize the treatment and avoid the hiatus that can generate or continue "misuse. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{ecological}} {{efficiency of}} industrial production {{has become the}} focus of a range of innovative and promising research and implementation activities. Eco-efficiency promises to achieve a less polluted environment at lower costs than pollution control and ensure human well-being with less detrimental effects than adaptation and remediation. At the same time, it is less radical and therefore offers a higher promise for success than service efficiency or sufficiency. This paper reviews a broad range of activities that are of interest to the “industrial transformation ” focus of the International Human Dimensions of Global Environmental Change Program. It offers a framework in which eco-efficiency is organized in five categories: pollution prevention, cleaner technology, design for environment, loop closing, and environmental management systems. Pollution prevention focuses on changes to existing equipment and technology and includes input <b>substitution</b> and improved <b>maintenance.</b> Cleaner technology aims to develop new technologies. Design for environment includes environmental considerations as criteria for the design process for products and manufacturing. Material loops can be closed using remanufacturing, recycling and industrial ecosystems. Environmental management systems try to change the day-to-day management practice to address and document factors influencing the environmental performance of companies. Life cycle assessment and environmental impact evaluation are tools useful for all of these efforts.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{tradeoff}} in time allocation between maintenance activities/travel and discretionary activities/travel. We recognize that people generally must travel a minimum {{amount of time in}} order to allocate one unit of time to the activity. This minimum amount of travel is represented by the travel time price, a ratio obtained by dividing the total amount of time traveling to maintenance or discretionary activities by the total amount of time spent on activities of the same type; it is the time equivalent of the monetary price for performing an activity. Using the San Francisco Bay Area 1996 Household Travel Survey data and applying the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) of demand equations, we found that with respect to the time equivalent of income elasticities of maintenance and discretionary activities, the former is less than unity and the latter is greater than unity. In other words, maintenance activities are a necessity and discretionary activities are a luxury. With respect to the own travel time price elasticities, if the travel time price of performing a certain type of activity increases (for reasons such as traffic congestion), one would reduce the time allocated to that type of activity. Time spent on maintenance activities is less elastic than the time spent on discretionary activities. As for the cross travel time price elasticities (changes in time allocated to activity type i in responses to changes in the time price for activity type j), we found that epsilon(dm) > 0 and epsilon(md) > 0, suggesting a <b>substitution</b> effect between <b>maintenance</b> and discretionary activities...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} reported the in vitro generation of a neutralization-resistant {{variant of the}} molecularly cloned isolate of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1), HXB 2 D. The molecular basis for the resistance was {{shown to be a}} point mutation in the env gene, causing the substitution of threonine for alanine at position 582 of gp 41. Here, we show the variant to be resistant to syncytium inhibition as well as to neutralization by the immune-selecting serum. Moreover, 30 % of HIV-positive human sera able to neutralize the parental virus have significantly decreased ability to neutralize the variant. As the A-to-T substitution thus has general relevance to the interaction of HIV- 1 with the host immune system, we investigated further the biologic and immunologic bases for the altered properties. Synthetic peptides corresponding to the 582 region failed to compete in infectivity, neutralization, or syncytium inhibition assays and did not elicit neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, human antibodies, affinity purified on synthetic peptide resins, bound to gp 41 and peptides from the 582 region but did not possess neutralizing antibody activity. Some viral constructs in which the AVERY sequence in the 582 region was altered by site-directed mutagenesis were not infectious, indicating that the primary structure in this region is crucial for viral infectivity. Constructs predicted to possess a local secondary structure {{similar to that of the}} variant nevertheless behaved like the parental virus and remained neutralization sensitive. These results suggest that the requirements for neutralization resistance in this region are very precise. Our results with synthetic peptides show that the 582 region does not by itself constitute a neutralization epitope. Moreover, the degree of flexibility in amino acid <b>substitution</b> which allows <b>maintenance</b> of neutralization sensitivity suggests that position 582 does not form part of a noncontiguous neutralization epitope. The basis for neutralization resistance of the immune-selected variant is more likely a conformational change altering a neutralization epitope at a distant site...|$|R
40|$|Health {{political}} background: Methadone {{substitution treatment}} in Germany is introduced in 1988 {{in the framework}} of a scientific pilot study in North Rhein Westphalia. Recent statistics show that by now a broad offer of substitution treatment exists. From 1 June 2002 to 31 December 2003 113, 000 substitution treatments have been recorded as being started of which around 56, 000 have been recorded as ongoing treatments by 1 December 2003. Scientific background: Substitution treatment (treatment of opioid-dependent persons using substitution substances) is one part of addiction treatment. Its goals are harm reduction and the stabilisation of opioid dependent persons. Integration of opioid-dependent persons in a treatment-setting, reduction of consumption of psychoactive substances, reduction of risk behaviour (primarily related to infectious diseases), decrease of mortality and improvements concerning the social, psychic and physic situation are seen as a success of <b>substitution</b> treatment as <b>maintenance</b> therapy. Research questions: The aim of this HTA report is to investigate which indicators can be used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} substitution treatment. Based on these indicators an evaluation of the medical, social and economical benefit of substitution treatment - also in relation to abstinence oriented treatment - is carried out. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed in 31 international databases which yielded 2451 articles with publication date between 1995 and February 2005. Results: After a twofold selection process 32 publications were included for assessment and 276 publications were used as background literature. Despite serious restrictions due to selection bias and dropout in most studies focusing on substitution treatment, reduction of consumption of illegal opioids, reduction of risk behaviour, criminal behaviour, mortality and incidence of HIV can be seen as an empirically proven success of substitution treatment. Concerning the improvement of life and health situation the results of the studies are contradictory. The results show that retention rate of substitution treatment is higher than retention rate of abstinence oriented treatment. Regarding economical aspects substitution treatment is efficient in avoiding secondary illnesses (infections) and decreasing criminality. From the perspective of medical ethics substitution treatment as well as medical prescription of heroin is in principle acceptable. Discussion and conclusions: Based on these results, it can be recommended that substitution treatment in principle should be made available for all opioid dependent persons. The decision whether substitution treatment or another treatment (e. g. abstinence oriented treatment) is more promising has to take into account the individual situation of the client. In addition a combination of substitution treatment and abstinence oriented treatment might be promising although there is a lack of studies about this approach. In any case the decision concerning a certain form of treatment should leave aside pseudo-moralic concerns and should be made on the base of established medical ethic principles - like the interest of the patient - taking into account the specific situation of the client...|$|R
