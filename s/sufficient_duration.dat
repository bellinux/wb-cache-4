60|$|The second error {{to which}} the {{landlord}} is liable, is that of mistaking a mere temporary rise of prices, for a rise of <b>sufficient</b> <b>duration</b> to warrant an increase of rents. It frequently happens, that a scarcity {{of one or two}} years, or an unusual demand arising from any other cause, may raise the price of raw produce to a height, at which it cannot be maintained. And the farmers, who take land under the influence of such prices, will, in the return of a more natural state of things, probably break, and leave their farms in a ruined and exhausted state. These short periods of high price are of great importance in generating capital upon the land, if the farmers are allowed to have the advantage of them; but, if they are grasped at prematurely by the landlord, capital is destroyed, instead of being accumulated; and both the landlord and the country incur a loss, instead of gaining a benefit.|$|E

In one hand was his sword, but a voice arose, crying in tones of authority. [...] "Take her alive! Do not harm her!" [...] Instantly the fellow returned his sword to its scabbard and then Tara of Helium was upon him. Straight for that beautiful body she sprang and in the instant that the arms closed to seize her her sharp blade drove deep into the naked chest. The impact hurled them both to the ground and as Tara of Helium sprang to her feet again she saw, to her horror, that the loathsome head had rolled from the body and was now crawling away from her on six short, spider-like legs. The body struggled spasmodically and lay still. As brief as had been the delay caused by the encounter, it still had been of <b>sufficient</b> <b>duration</b> to undo her, for even as she rose two more of the things fell upon her and instantly thereafter she was surrounded. Her blade sank once more into naked flesh and once more a head rolled free and crawled away. Then they overpowered her and in another moment she was surrounded by fully a hundred of the creatures, all seeking to lay hands upon her. At first she thought that they wished to tear her to pieces in revenge for her having slain two of their fellows, but presently she realized that they were prompted more by curiosity than by any sinister motive.|$|E

Two important habitat requirements for waterbirds are an inundated area of sufficient depth and of suitable duration for breeding, and a sufficient inundated area of shallow water from which they can feed. We investigated {{the influence of a}} variable wetting and drying regime on these habitat requirements, and related them to known waterbird breeding events in the Narran Lakes, Australia. The complexity of the Narran lakes ecosystem, with its different wetland components, makes it an ideal site for the provision of these habitat conditions.

40|$|Background The {{contribution}} of <b>sufficient</b> sleep <b>duration</b> to lower CVD risk {{in addition to}} sufficient physical activity, a healthy diet, (moderate) alcohol consumption, and non-smoking has not been investigated yet. Design The MORGEN study is a prospective cohort study including 8128 men and 9759 women aged 20 - 65 years, free of CVD at baseline. Methods Sufficient physical activity (3. 5 h/week cycling or sports), a healthy diet (Mediterranean Diet Score 5), (moderate) alcohol consumption (1 beverage/month), non-smoking, and <b>sufficient</b> sleep <b>duration</b> (7 hours) were assessed by self-administered questionnaires between 1994 and 1997. Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality were ascertained through linkage with national registers. Hazard ratios and preventable proportions were calculated adjusted for age, sex, and educational level. Results During 10 - 14 years of follow up, 607 composite CVD events (fatal CVD, nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke) occurred, of which 129 were fatal. Those with the four traditional healthy lifestyle factors had a 57 % lower risk of composite CVD (HR 0. 43, 95 % CI 0. 31 - 0. 59) and a 67 % lower risk of fatal CVD (HR 0. 33, 95 % CI 0. 16 - 0. 68) compared with those with none or one healthy lifestyle factor. Sleeping sufficiently {{in addition to the}} four traditional lifestyle factors resulted in a 65 % lower risk of composite CVD (HR 0. 35, 95 % CI 0. 23 - 0. 52), and an 83 % lower risk of fatal CVD (HR 0. 17, 95 % CI 0. 07 - 0. 43). Conclusions Sufficient sleep and adherence to all four traditional healthy lifestyle factors was associated with lower CVD risk.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} was to conduct a scientifically rigorous update to the National Sleep Foundationâ€™s sleep duration recommendations. Methods: The National Sleep Foundation convened an 18 -member multidisciplinary expert panel, representing 12 stakeholder organizations, to evaluate scientific literature concerning sleep duration recommendations. We determined expert recommendations for <b>sufficient</b> sleep <b>durations</b> across the lifespan using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method. Results: The panel agreed that, for healthy individuals with normal sleep, the appropriate sleep duration for newborns is between 14 and 17 hours, infants between 12 and 15 hours, toddlers between 11 and 14 hours, preschoolers between 10 and 13 hours, and school-aged children between 9 and 11 hours. For teenagers, 8 to 10 hours was considered appropriate, 7 to 9 hours for young adults and adults, and 7 to 8 hours of sleep for older adults. Conclusions: <b>Sufficient</b> sleep <b>duration</b> requirements vary across the lifespan and fromperson to person. The recommendations reported here represent guidelines for healthy individuals and those not suffering froma sleep disorder. Sleep durations outside the recommended range may be appropriate, but deviating far from thenormal range is rare. Individuals who habitually sleep outside the normal range may be exhibiting signs or symptoms of serious health problems or, if done volitionally,may be compromising their health and well-being...|$|R

40|$|The {{physiological}} and behavioural development of diving was examined in Australian fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus) pups {{to assess whether}} animals at weaning are capable of exploiting the same resources as adult females. Haematocrit, haemoglobin and myoglobin contents all increased throughout pup development though total body oxygen stores reached only 71 % of adult female levels just prior to weaning. Oxygen storage components, however, did not develop at the same pace. Whereas blood oxygen stores had reached adult female levels by 9 months of age, muscle oxygen stores were slower to develop, reaching only 23 % of adult levels by this age.

30|$|Considering {{the large}} number and types of new {{nanomaterials}} being developed and coming to the market, in vitro studies are essential in assessing the toxicity in high-throughput systems as they provide rapid and cost-effective screening. In most in vitro cytotoxicity experiments, cells are cultured in a culture medium to which a prepared dispersion of the NPs in a suitable solution is introduced. In contrast, in vivo toxicology studies frequently employ NPs dispersed in a suitable medium that are subsequently injected into the blood vessels or tissues of the animal model. If successful, the dispersed NPs will reach tumor sites and achieve deep penetration and entrapment in the cancerous tissue {{by means of the}} enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, characterized by increased vascular permeability and compressed lymphatic networks in solid tumors [21]. However, making highly stable and efficient dispersions of nanoparticles to achieve efficient nanoparticle delivery for both in vitro and in vivo applications has been a challenging task. A major difference that NPs possess compared to the well-studied conventional toxic chemicals (which are well soluble molecules and ions) is the difficulty in dispersing them in suitable solutions and culture media and to maintain them as stable dispersions for <b>sufficient</b> <b>durations</b> [22]. For most in vitro studies, NP suspensions should remain stable at least for 24 Â h while in vivo studies require stability for much longer durations [23]. Formation of large agglomerates and their sedimentation over longer periods often prevents a significant fraction of the NPs from participating in efficient interactions with the test cells and the resulting cytotoxic response.|$|R
