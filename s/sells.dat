40|$|The {{research}} {{problem in this}} thesis has been formulated as: How can industrial <b>selling</b> performed by Swedish manufacturing {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} in the different <b>selling</b> situations be characterized? The {{research problem}} has been further developed in forms of three research questions dealing with <b>selling</b> activities, individuals involved in <b>selling,</b> and <b>selling</b> processes in the different <b>selling</b> situations. The <b>selling</b> situations included are; new <b>selling</b> task, modified <b>selling</b> task and routine <b>selling</b> task. Selling in this study has been defined as the activities performed by any individual(s) for the purpose of doing business at an individual customer level. Further, small and medium-sized companies have been defined as companies with 10 - 249 employees. The intention with this research has not been to quantitatively describe and generalize findings to all Swedish manufacturing SMEs. Instead, an exploratory and descriptive perspective has been adopted. The ambition, however, have been to begin to understand how Swedish manufacturing SMEs perform industrial <b>selling.</b> The approach for this study is to be considered qualitative. In order to address our research problem and research questions, four case studies in two different industries were investigated. Within the manufacturing industry, one small and one-medium sized company was selected. Similarly, one small and one medium-sized company in the electronics industry were identified. Personal interviews were used in order to collect data. Totally, we have interviewed 19 respondents in different positions within the selected companies. The findings indicate that <b>selling</b> activities performed by the manufacturing SMEs in this study are complex and includes a variety of different activities. In addition to activities included in the conceptual framework, a new class of activities was identified, where the <b>selling</b> company was engaged in developing the customer's operations fundamentally. The individuals we found to be involved in <b>selling</b> were many and represented several different functions within the <b>selling</b> company. Furthermore, the findings indicate that the studied companies included external individuals when performing their <b>selling.</b> Finally, we also found that the performed <b>selling</b> activities could be described in several <b>selling</b> processes. Our findings indicate that the <b>selling</b> processes vary from rather simple and transaction-oriented <b>selling</b> processes to more complex processes dealing with both long-term customer relationships and single transactions.
