40|$|This study {{investigated}} the influence of time delay and duration of photo-activation on linear polymerization shrinkage, <b>shrinkage</b> <b>force,</b> and hardening of a dual-cured core build-up resin composite. The test material (Rebilda DC) was light-cured for 20 or 60 s either early (2 min) or late (7 min) {{after the start of}} mixing. Non-irradiated self-cured specimens served as controls. Linear shrinkage and <b>shrinkage</b> <b>force</b> were measured for 60 min using custom-made devices. Knoop hardness was determined {{at the end of the}} observation period. Self-cured controls, showing a linear shrinkage similar to that of specimens early light-cured for 20 s generated the lowest <b>shrinkage</b> <b>force</b> and hardness. A shorter light exposure time (20 s vs. 60 s) reduced linear shrinkage, <b>shrinkage</b> <b>force,</b> and hardness when early light-curing was performed, but did not affect the three properties in specimens light-cured late after the start of mixing. Late photo-activation increased linear shrinkage, irrespective of irradiation time, and resulted in a higher <b>shrinkage</b> <b>force</b> and hardness for short light exposure time. A moderate correlation was found between the two shrinkage properties studied (r(2) = 0. 65). In conclusion, improvements in shrinkage behavior of the tested core build-up material were associated with inferior hardening, making it important to adapt curing protocols to the clinical situation...|$|E

Three light-curing resin composites (SDR bulk-fill, Esthet X flow, and Esthet X HD) and one dual-curing material (Rebilda DC) were subjected to different irradiation protocols with identical energy density (27 J cm− 2) : high-intensity continuous light (HIC), low-intensity continuous light (LIC), soft-start (SS), and pulse-delay curing (PD). Axial shrinkage and <b>shrinkage</b> <b>force</b> of 1. 5 -mm-thick specimens were recorded in real time for 15 min using custom-made devices. Knoop hardness was determined {{at the end of}} the observation period. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences among the curing protocols for both Knoop hardness and axial shrinkage, irrespective of the composite material. Pulse-delay curing generated the significantly lowest shrinkage forces within the three light-curing materials SDR bulk-fill, Esthet X flow, and Esthet X HD. High-intensity continuous light created the significantly highest shrinkage forces within Esthet X HD and Rebilda DC, and caused significantly higher forces than LIC within Esthet X flow. In conclusion, both the composite material and the applied curing protocol control <b>shrinkage</b> <b>force</b> formation.

40|$|OBJECTIVES To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} pre-heating of high-viscosity bulk-fill composite materials on their degree of conversion and <b>shrinkage</b> <b>force</b> formation. METHODS Four bulk-fill composite materials (Tetric EvoCeram Bulk Fill-TECBF, x-tra fil-XF, QuixFil-QF, SonicFill-SF) and one conventional nano-hybrid resin composite (Tetric EvoCeram-TEC) were used. The test materials were either kept at room temperature or pre-heated to 68 °C {{by means of a}} commercial heating device, before being photoactivated with a LED curing unit for 20 s at 1170 mW/cm(2). Shrinkage forces (n= 5) of 1. 5 -mm-thick specimens were recorded in real-time for 15 min inside a temperature-controlled chamber at 25 °C (simulating intraoral temperature after rubber dam application) with a custom-made stress analyzer. Degree of conversion (n= 5) was determined at the bottom of equally thick (1. 5 mm) specimens using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Data were analyzed with Student's t-test, ANOVA and Tukey's HSD post-hoc test (α= 0. 05). RESULTS Composite pre-heating significantly increased the degree of conversion of TECBF, but had no effect on monomer conversion of the other materials investigated. For each of the test materials, pre-heated composite generated significantly lower shrinkage forces than room-temperature composite. At both temperature levels, TECBF created the significantly highest shrinkage forces, and QF caused significantly higher shrinkage forces than both XF and TEC. CONCLUSIONS Both the composite material and the pre-cure temperature affect <b>shrinkage</b> <b>force</b> formation. Pre-heating of bulk-fill and conventional restorative composites prior to photoactivation decreases polymerization-induced shrinkage forces without compromising the degree of conversion.

The method of choice for doing this is laser welding, due to its inherit attributes of strength, cleanliness and long-term reliability [1]. However, the disadvantage of laser welding is the so-called Welding Induced Alignment Distortion (WIAD).

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{investigate}} the subsurface degree of conversion (DC) and <b>shrinkage</b> <b>force</b> formation of low-viscosity (flowable) bulk-fill composite materials. MATERIALS AND METHODS Three flowable bulk-fill resin composites [SureFil SDR flow (SDR; Dentsply DeTrey), Venus Bulk Fill (VB; Heraeus Kulzer) and x-tra base (XB; VOCO) ] and one conventional flowable control composite material [EsthetX flow (EX; Dentsply DeTrey) ] were tested. The materials were photoactivated for 20 s at an irradiance of 1170 mW/cm 2 and the DC (n= 5) was recorded at 0. 1 -, 1. 5 - and 4 -mm depth using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Shrinkage forces (n= 5) of 1. 5 -mm-thick specimens were continuously recorded for 15 min using a custom-made stress analyzer. Data were statistically analyzed by ANOVA, Tukey's HSD and Bonferroni's post-hoc tests (α= 0. 05). RESULTS SDR generated the significantly lowest shrinkage forces (22. 9 ± 1. 4 N), but also attained the significantly lowest DC at 1. 5 -mm depth (67. 5 ± 0. 8 %). The conventional flowable composite EX generated the significantly highest shrinkage forces (40. 7 ± 0. 7 N) and reached {{a significantly higher}} DC (74. 4 ± 1. 3 %) compared to SDR and XB at 1. 5 -mm depth. The <b>shrinkage</b> <b>force</b> values of VB (29. 4 ± 1. 1 N) and XB (28. 3 ± 0. 6 N) were similar (p> 0. 05).

40|$|The {{composite}} resins {{are used}} as filling material to restore tooth cavities. The polymerization shrinkage of dental resin composites bonded to cavity walls leads to <b>shrinkage</b> <b>force</b> having {{negative effect on the}} restoration-tooth interface. The cavity must resist this tensile force. In a filling the bonded resin composite is deformed by the shrinkage and causes tensile stress on the tooth. Particularly, the light-cured composites harden very fast and at the beginning cause high tensile stress. The objective of the present study is to investigate the forces arising during polymerization shrinkage of several light-cured resin composites by proving different materials and sample lengths. After preliminary tests with nine series and 80 trials no influence can be determined by the application of a supporting polyethylene sleeve as well as different irradiation times or humidity appearing. The measurements of the principal trails have been affected at a universal test machine (Instron, model 6025) between two silan-coated steel disks (diameter d = 6 mm) during a period of 360 seconds. The irradiation time of the polymerization amounts to 60 seconds. Seven light-cured composites resins Dyract (Dentsply), Spectrum TPH (Dentsply), Visio-Dispers (Espe), Visio-Molar (Espe), Charisma (Kulzer), Charisma F (Kulzer) and Durafill VS (Kulzer), with three different sample lengths (2, 4, 8 mm, 10 trials each), in total 210 measurements, are investigated. Larger sample lengths cause a significantly larger <b>shrinkage</b> <b>force</b> (u-test after MANN and WHITNEY, p < 0. 0001). This force increase is not proportional to the sample length. The lowest <b>shrinkage</b> <b>force</b> is caused by Dyract (2 mm with 14. 6 N, 4 mm with 18. 2 N, 8 mm with 24. 6 N), the highest Visio-Dispers (2 mm with 29. 9 N, 4 mm with 38. 2 N, 8 mm with 53. 2 N). The minimum tensile stress is 0. 5 MPa and the maximum tensile stress is 1. 9 MPa. The forces arising from the seven materials differ significantly. No obvious correlation of inorganic filler volume, type of fillers, Young´s modulus and consistency could be found during the polymerization. With an in vitro test, polymerizing composites resins cause a tension stress below the tensile strength of enamel.

40|$|AbstractLa 5. 4 WO 12 −δ (LaWO) is a {{promising}} membrane {{candidate for a}} variety of H 2 -related applications due to its appreciable levels of mixed proton–electron conduction and its stability in moist reducing atmospheres at elevated temperatures. Governed by Wagner theory, the H 2 permeation performance of a membrane can be enhanced by reducing its thickness. Therefore, the present work deals with preparing LaWO supported membranes with reduced thickness and optimised microstructure. Combining a dense membrane with a porous supporting layer is associated with mismatched sintering rates, which ultimately lead to bending effects. Therefore, the sintering behaviour of both the dense membrane and the porous substrate must be carefully adjusted to each other. For this purpose, single and co-fired membrane and substrate layers were produced by tape casting. Sintering experiments were carried out with an optical dilatometer. The shrinkage and microstructural evolution of the layers were evaluated in terms of the anisotropic <b>shrinkage</b> <b>forces</b> and the membrane rigidness counteracting the substrate shrinkage.

In the same time, the yield strength increased and breaking strength decreases and the elongation decreased dramatically for O state, but, for H 26 state, the strength and elongation increased dramatically, which correspond to the properties of this state at low temperatures.

40|$|Research {{has been}} carried out with the aim of better {{understanding}} the relevant properties of materials to be used in a new self-healing cementitious composite material system. The system consists of shape memory polymer tendons embedded within a cementitious matrix, upon heat activation these tendons undergo a shrinkage process which closes any cracks present. After this heat activation, autogenous healing of the cracks is enhanced by the ongoing application of pressure to the cracked faces. In a previous study the build-up of stress in a restrained poly(ethylene terephthalate) specimen upon heat activation was investigated. In the current study, the long term stress relaxation behaviour of such a restrained specimen has been investigated so that its potential for use in the material system described above can be better understood. Both experimental and numerical approaches have been undertaken. A specimen of poly(ethylene terephthalate) was restrained against longitudinal shrinkage and a heat of 90 oC applied for a duration of 10 minutes to simulate the conditions it would be subject to within the system. The stress in the specimen was continuously monitored during heat activation, cooling, and for approximately 6 months after this. This data was used to quantify the stress relaxation of the specimen. The stress relaxation over the period studied was found to be very low; the peak stress was 32. 80 MPa, this fell to a minimum value of 30. 84 MPa after a period of approximately 97 days had elapsed. These low levels of stress relaxation are beneficial to the system since a larger <b>shrinkage</b> <b>force</b> will be applied {{for a longer period of}} time, which should also lead to improved autogenous healing of cracks...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. To {{verify the}} {{hypothesis}} that crack analysis and a mechanical test would rank a series of composites in a similar order with respect to polymerization stress. Also, both tests would show similar relationships between stress and composite elastic modulus and/or shrinkage. Methods. Soda-lime glass discs (2 -mm thick) with a central perforation (3. 5 -mm diameter) received four Vickers indentations 500 mu m from the cavity margin. The indent cracks were measured (500 x) prior and 10 min after the cavity was restored with one of six materials (Kalore/KL, Gradia/GR, Ice/IC, Wave/WV, Majesty Flow/MF, and Majesty Posterior/MP). Stresses at the indent site were calculated based on glass fracture toughness and increase in crack length. Stress at the bonded interface was calculated using the equation for an internally pressurized cylinder. The mechanical test used a universal testing machine and glass rods (5 -mm diameter) as substrate. An extensometer monitored specimen height (2 mm). Nominal stress was calculated dividing the maximum <b>shrinkage</b> <b>force</b> by the specimen cross-sectional area. Composite elastic modulus was determined by nanoindentation and post-gel shrinkage was measured using strain gages. Data were subjected to one-way ANOVA/Tukey or Kruskal-Wallis/Mann-Whitney tests (alpha: 5 %). Results. Both tests grouped the composites in three statistical subsets, with small differences in overlapping between the intermediate subset (MF, WV) and the highest (MP, IC) or the lowest stress materials (KL, GR). Higher stresses were developed by composites with high modulus and/or high shrinkage. Significance.

40|$|International audienceIt {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that critical properties of geo-materials that {{play a key}} role in failure of earth-structures undergo often a substantial evolution induced by non-mechanical processes and variables. That includes: hydro-thermal fracture, thermal collapse, chemical mass removal or accretion (dissolution or precipitation), chemical shrinkage/swelling, drying <b>shrinkage,</b> capillary <b>force</b> evolution during pore water phase change. The properties affected are: strength in all its manifestation, compressibility, permeability, thermal conductivity, to mention just a few. The physical processes involved are either natural or engineered. Their phenomenology is per se a conundrum, as often they constitute a series of parallel or sequential processes. A review of several phenomena leading to geomaterial degradation, and methodology is presented to deal with multi-physical couplings in constitutive modeling. In plasticity, the central constitutive function is a hardening rule. Also in this case, phenomenological observations indicate a chemo-mechanical, two-way coupling. Other degradation phenomena discussed include drying—cracking, and or the role of suction induced hardening in unsaturated materials...|$|R
40|$|The {{moisture}} loss and drying shrinkage behavior of mortar with mineral admixture such as blast-furnace slag and fly ash are investigated {{focusing on the}} microstructure affected by curing temperature. The curing at high temperature greatly accelerates the hydration reaction of the mortar with mineral admixture to make pore structure denser and leads to smaller {{moisture loss}} than that of mortar without mineral admixture. The moisture loss is almost proportional to the accumulated volume of pores whose radii are larger than the radius at the liquid/vapour interface based on the Kelvin equation and BET theory of absorbed water. When the shrinkage {{is assumed to be}} induced only by the capillary tension, the estimated shrinkage shows different tendency from experimental one. It suggests that the other <b>shrinkage</b> driving <b>forces</b> that have been believed to be dominant under severe drying conditions should be taken into account even under normal drying condition (RH= 60 % at 20 degree) ...|$|R
40|$|Stereolithography is a rapid {{prototyping}} method that {{is becoming an}} important product realization and concurrent engineering tool, with applications in advanced and agile manufacturing. During the build process, material behavior {{plays a significant role}} in the mechanics leading to internal stresses and, potentially, to distortion (curling) of parts. The goal of the ``Stereolithography Manufacturing Process Modeling and Optimization`` LDRD program was to develop engineering tools for improving overall part accuracy during the stereolithography build process. These tools include phenomenological material models of solidifying stereolithography photocurable resins and a 3 D finite element architecture that incorporates time varying material behavior, laser path dependence, and structural linkage. This SAND report discusses the in situ measurement of <b>shrinkage</b> and <b>force</b> relaxation behavior of two photocurable resins, and the measurement of curl in simple cantilever beams. These studies directly supported the development of phenomenological material models for solidifying resins and provided experimental curl data to compare to model predictions...|$|R
