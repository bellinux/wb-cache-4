40|$|The name {{broccoli}} comes mainly {{due to its}} appearance: broccoli {{comes from}} the Latin Brachium, which means strong arm or branch. Broccoli itself has lots of arms or branches that grow from the main stem. Broccoli doesn’t {{have a long history}} in Romania, it’s cultivated on small parcels by small gardeners for their own consumption and the broccoli that we find in supermarkets are mostly imported from other countries and it’s quite expensive. Broccoli is very good against cancer and in Romania cancer rate is growing every year that’s why people should start eating broccoli. It’s also a good source of vitamins (A, B 2, C) also calcium, potassium. Romania also has a temperate climate that is recommended for broccoli growing. We can grow it in early spring, spring and autumn. That’s why we tried in our research to find the best way to produce broccoli. We tested three hybrids: Fiesta F 1, Marathon F 1 and Belstar F 1, also different densities and different ways to set the crop in the field (with two rows or three rows). After we cut the main broccoli sprouts, secondary sprouts (also called <b>side</b> <b>shoots)</b> will start developing. <b>Side</b> <b>shoots</b> will vary in size and weight, depending on the hybrid but as general information, <b>side</b> <b>shoots</b> are smaller than main broccoli heads.

50|$|Heath {{barberry}} {{is a low}} (up to ½ m {{high and}} over 1 m wide in the wild) shrub. The mature twigs have a warm brown color, with 3-branched, flattened, light brown spines (1-1½ cm long) under each short <b>side</b> <b>shoot.</b> The thick, narrow leaves are semi-deciduous, linear in shape (1-2 cm long), somewhat bluish-green, with entire, rolled-under margins, and pointed, often purplish tips that may later die-down to a light brown.

As in other Berberis species, the tepals are set in four whorls of three to five and equal in shape and color, so {{it is difficult to}} separate sepals from petals. The filament has a tooth on each side near its upper end, where the anther is attached. The fruit is a globose, blue-black berry of about 7 mm in diameter.|$|E

40|$|Two {{methods for}} restricting plant height (CCC {{application}} and excision {{of the main}} shoot apex) were applied to okra cv. ‘Boyiatiou’ {{with the aim of}} assisting crop management and optimizing yield. Apex excision 26 or 40 days after transplantation (DAT) effectively restricted plant height, but either had no effect (40 DAT) or reduced the number of side shoots per plant (26 DAT). Moreover, although the length of side shoots increased after apex excision, the number of nodes per <b>side</b> <b>shoot</b> was not affected. Hence pod number and weight was less than in the control (untreated). CCC application (500 and 2000 ppm) reduced plant height due to a reduction in internode length; however, when applied at the time of transplantation (0 DAT) (both concentrations) or 26 DAT (2000 ppm) it also caused a reduction in node number on the main stem. CCC did not affect the number of side shoots or the number of nodes per shoot, and <b>side</b> <b>shoot</b> length decreased due to shorter internode lengths. The number and weight of pods per plant was reduced by 2000 ppm CCC irrespective of the time of application, but was not affected by 500 ppm CCC at 0 DAT (pod number) or 40 DAT (pod weight and number). We conclude that the application of 500 ppm CCC at 40 DAT may aid okra cultivation since it reduces overall plant size (height and diameter) without adversely affecting yield, and may thus assist crop management (e. g. easier hand-harvesting) and permit an increase in plant density...|$|E
40|$|Flowering Locus T (FT) plays {{a pivotal}} role in floral induction. It {{integrates}} the inputs from a complex network of flowering signalling pathways. Flowering is an efficiently orchestrated event that occurs in a plant at a particular time to ensure maximum reproductive success. It has been suggested that the FT protein is a long- distance mobile floral stimulus. In this report studies with a mutant version of FT (mFT) which had the start codon replaced with a stop codon to generate a non-translatable FT indicated that the mRNA was also capable of long distance movement although its physiological function as a floral stimulus was inhibited. Gene function study of FT and FT orthologues on brassica, tobacco, tomato and potato using the plant virus expression vector Potato Virus X (PVX) generated some interesting findings. In Short day Maryland Mammoth tobacco plants the overexpression of the Arabidopsis FT under non-inductive Long day condition induced early flowering while the mFT and mock control remained in the vegetative stage. In short day potato, it did not seem to have an effect on tuberization as only one from five of the inoculated plants tuberized. In brassica (broccoli) the effect on flowering time was inhibited due to Virus-induced Gene Silencing (VIGS) but the tomato FT (SP 6 A) had an effect on flowering time. In tomato, the overexpression of the Arabidopsis FT and FT- orthologues from tomato induced early flowering but the difference in flowering time in comparison to the controls was only a few days. Phenotypical and morphological changes such as seed production and lateral <b>side</b> <b>shoot</b> development were caused by expression of the target genes. The exact mechanism of action of these genes in the control of seed production and lateral <b>side</b> <b>shoot</b> development is unclear...|$|E

40|$|The {{enormous}} {{variation in}} architecture of flowering plants is based {{to a large}} extent on their ability to form new axes of growth throughout their life span. Secondary growth is initiated from groups of pluripotent cells, called meristems, which are established in the axils of leaves. Such meristems form lateral organs and develop into a <b>side</b> <b>shoot</b> or a flower, depending on the developmental status of the plant and environmental conditions. The phytohormone auxin is well known {{to play an important role}} in inhibiting the outgrowth of axillary buds, a phenomenon known as apical dominance. However, the role of auxin in the process of axillary meristem formation is largely unknown. In this study, we show in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) that auxin is depleted from leaf axils during vegetative development. Disruption of polar auxin transport compromises auxin depletion from the leaf axil and axillary meristem initiation. Ectopic auxin biosynthesis in leaf axils interferes with axillary meristem formation, whereas repression of auxin signaling in polar auxin transport mutants can largely rescue their branching defects. These results strongly suggest that depletion of auxin from leaf axils is a prerequisite for axillary meristem formation during vegetative development...|$|E

This research aimed to study the difference in glass particle contamination from ampules with different intravenous administration methods commonly used in clinical practice.

The <b>side</b> <b>shooting</b> group also showed the smallest number of glass particles, but it was statistically insignificant.
