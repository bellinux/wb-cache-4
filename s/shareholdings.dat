5|$|Brown's {{government}} introduced {{monetary and}} fiscal policies {{to help keep}} the banks afloat during the financial crisis in 2008, and as a result the United Kingdom's national debt increased dramatically. The Government took majority <b>shareholdings</b> in Northern Rock and Royal Bank of Scotland, both of which experienced financial difficulties. Large amounts of money were injected into several other banks, including newly merged HBOS-Lloyds TSB, which received £17billion. Domestic policies focusing on education, employment and health were introduced by the administration. The Labour Party was persuaded to give Gurkhas settlement rights in Britain by the campaign of actress Joanna Lumley and attracted criticism for its handling of the Scottish Government's release of Abdelbaset al-Megrahithe only person to have been convicted over the 1988 Lockerbie bombing. Brown was also dogged by allegations of bullying.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{shareholder}} on the Arsenal {{board is}} American sports tycoon Stan Kroenke. Kroenke first launched {{a bid for}} the club in April 2007, and faced competition for shares from Red and White Securities, which acquired its first shares off David Dein in August 2007. Red & White Securities was co-owned by Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov and Iranian London-based financier Farhad Moshiri, though Usmanov bought Moshiri's stake in 2016. Kroenke came close to the 30% takeover threshold in November 2009, when he increased his holding to 18,594 shares (29.9%). In April 2011, Kroenke achieved a full takeover by purchasing the <b>shareholdings</b> of Nina Bracewell-Smith and Danny Fiszman, taking his shareholding to 62.89%. As of May 2017, Kroenke owns 41,721 shares (67.05%) and Red & White Securities own 18,695 shares (30.04%). Ivan Gazidis has been the club's Chief Executive since 2009.|$|E
5|$|In , the {{caretaker}} government approved plans to turn Biman {{into a public}} limited company with <b>shareholdings</b> split between seven public sector organisations. As {{a part of the}} restructuring, the government put in place a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) to reduce the man-equipment ratio (MER) of 367:1 (ratio of manpower to aircraft). The industry average at the time was 200:1, and other Asian airlines operated with MERs of about 150:1. The VRS provided compensation based on length of service, at a cost to the government of over BDT2.97billion borrowed from the World Bank. Biman management expected to reduce its workforce by 1,600, but 2,162applications were received, many from employees who expected to be dismissed with little or no severance pay if the quota was not met. Biman accepted between 1,863 and 1877 applications, and affirmed that key personnel {{would not be allowed to}} leave the organisation via VRS.|$|E

40|$|Antitrust {{concern about}} {{keiretsu}} <b>shareholding</b> ties is misplaced and {{at odds with}} economic reasoning and with empirical investigation. <b>Shareholding</b> by suppliers in their customers assures the suppliers of rewards from their transaction-specific investments. <b>Shareholding</b> by customers in suppliers bonds the suppliers to cater more fully to the customers' interests. <b>Shareholding</b> by Japanese banks in the companies to which they lend resolves agency problems and lowers the costs of borrowing. Organization of firms into cross-shareholding groups magnifies the favorable effects of cross-shareholding by assuring that direct <b>shareholding</b> links give rise to indirect <b>shareholding</b> as well.
