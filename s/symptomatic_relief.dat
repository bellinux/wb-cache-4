40|$|Small fibre {{neuropathy}} is a neuropathy of {{the small}} non-myelinated C-fibres and myelinated Adelta-fibres. Clinically, an isolated small fibre neuropathy is distinguished by sensory and autonomic symptoms, with practically no abnormalities on neurological examination other than possible distorted pain and temperature sensation. Specific diagnostic tests for small fibre neuropathy are skin biopsy, including a count of the intra-epidermal small nerve fibres that cross the basal membrane, and quantitative sensory and autonomic testing. Diabetes mellitus is the most frequent underlying cause of small fibre neuropathy. Other causes can be classified into the following categories: toxic (e. g. alcohol), metabolic, immune-mediated, infectious and hereditary.

30|$|A {{significant}} number of patients currently suffering from coronary artery disease (CAD) experience severe ischemia due to multi-vessel atherosclerotic obstruction, leading to heart failure and impaired myocardial function (Allen et al. 2008). Prophylaxis and treatment for this patient population involves drug therapy, percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) (Allen et al. 2008; Kim et al. 2002). A large portion of these patients suffer from refractory CAD not amenable to percutaneous or conventional surgical interventions (Andréll et al. 2011; Allen et al. 2008; Kim et al. 2002). For this patient population the extent of CAD is widespread and traditional revascularization alone {{is not sufficient to}} reinstate adequate flow through the coronary vessels.

25|$|Although the {{prostate}} was first described by Venetian anatomist Niccolò Massa in 1536, {{and illustrated by}} Flemish anatomist Andreas Vesalius in 1538, prostate cancer was not identified until 1853. Prostate cancer was initially considered a rare disease, probably because of shorter life expectancies and poorer detection methods in the 19th century. The first treatments of prostate cancer were surgeries to relieve urinary obstruction. Removal of the entire gland (radical perineal prostatectomy) was first performed in 1904 by Hugh H. Young at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Surgical removal of the testes (orchiectomy) to treat prostate cancer was first performed in the 1890s, but with limited success. Transurethral resection of {{the prostate}} (TURP) replaced radical prostatectomy for <b>symptomatic</b> <b>relief</b> of obstruction {{in the middle of}} the 20th century because it could better preserve penile erectile function. Radical retropubic prostatectomy was developed in 1983 by Patrick Walsh. This surgical approach allowed for removal of the prostate and lymph nodes with maintenance of penile function.|$|E
25|$|Antiandrogens {{that are}} {{currently}} on the market are particularly useful {{for the treatment of}} prostate cancer during the early stages. However, prostate cancer often progresses to a hormone-refractory state in which the cancer progresses in the presence of continued androgen ablation or antiandrogen therapy. This suggests that long term use of these antiandrogens during prostate cancer can lead to the development of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells or the ability of adrenal androgens to support tumor growth. This phenomenon is called antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome (AWS) {{and is one of the}} major drawbacks of existing antiandrogens. AWS is defined as tumor regression or <b>symptomatic</b> <b>relief</b> observed upon discontinuation of the antiandrogen therapy. The mechanism for this is not fully understood but current theories include alterations of the AR gene, coregulator proteins and/or signal transduction pathways. This antiandrogen resistance may also be linked to the relative weakness of current antiandrogens as they have an affinity 50 times or more lower than that of DHT for the AR. This may also explain why compensatory AR overexpression is often observed.|$|E
25|$|The main {{goals of}} {{treatment}} in angina pectoris are relief of symptoms, slowing {{progression of the}} disease, and reduction of future events, especially heart attacks and death. Beta blockers (e.g., carvedilol, propranolol, atenolol) have {{a large body of}} evidence in morbidity and mortality benefits (fewer symptoms, less disability and longer life) and short-acting nitroglycerin medications have been used since 1879 for <b>symptomatic</b> <b>relief</b> of angina. Calcium channel blockers (such as nifedipine (Adalat) and amlodipine), isosorbide mononitrate and nicorandil are vasodilators commonly used in chronic stable angina. A new therapeutic class, called If inhibitor, has recently been made available: Ivabradine provides pure heart rate reduction leading to major anti-ischemic and antianginal efficacy. ACE inhibitors are also vasodilators with both symptomatic and prognostic benefit. Statins are the most frequently used lipid/cholesterol modifiers, which probably also stabilize existing atheromatous plaque. Low-dose aspirin decreases the risk of heart attack in patients with chronic stable angina, and was part of standard treatment. However, in patients without established cardiovascular disease, the increase in hemorrhagic stroke and gastrointestinal bleeding offsets any benefits and it is no longer advised unless the risk of myocardial infarction is very high.|$|E

Bovine NP tissue explants were injected with media (control), human MSCs (hMSCs) alone, acellular L-pNIPAM-co-DMAc hydrogel or hMSCs incorporated within the L-pNIPAM-co-DMAc hydrogel and maintained at 5 % O 2 for 6 weeks. Viability of native NP cells and delivered MSCs was maintained. Furthermore hMSCs delivered via the L-pNIPAM-co-DMAc hydrogel differentiated and produced NP matrix components: aggrecan, collagen type II and chondroitin sulphate, with integration of the hydrogel with native NP tissue. In addition L-pNIPAM-co-DMAc hydrogel injected into collagenase digested bovine discs filled micro and macro fissures, were maintained within the disc during loading and restored IVD stiffness. The mechanical support of the L-pNIPAM-co-DMAc hydrogel, to restore disc height, could provide immediate <b>symptomatic</b> pain <b>relief,</b> whilst the delivery of MSCs over time regenerates the NP extracellular matrix; thus the L-pNIPAM-co-DMAc hydrogel could provide a combined cellular and mechanical repair approach...|$|R

40|$|Upper airway {{symptoms}} or dysphagia {{may be caused}} by vascular anomalies, forming a ring around the trachea, oesophagus or both. To analyse the clinical presentation, use of various diagnostic techniques, treatment and follow-up we carried out a retrospective study of 38 children who had been diagnosed with a vascular ring between 1981 and 1996. We found 74 % of the vascular rings to be symptomatic, with inspiratory stridor and wheezing as the main complaints. The delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis of a vascular ring in patients without associated anomalies ranged from 1 to 84 mo. Associated anomalies were found in 53 % of cases and 80 % of these anomalies consisted of associated cardiovascular malformations. Oesophagography proved to be a valuable diagnostic technique when a vascular ring was suspected. Echocardiography appeared to be of little value for the diagnosis of a vascular ring, but was essential to exclude associated cardiovascular malformations. Although angiography has always been considered to be the gold standard in the determination of the exact anatomy of vascular rings, increasing evidence is available that CT scan or MRI may replace this role.

METHODS: This international, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial randomly assigned 747 patients with FM to placebo or 300, 450, or 600 mg/day pregabalin twice daily for 14 weeks. Primary efficacy measures were endpoint mean pain scores and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC). Secondary outcomes included assessments of sleep and function. RESULTS: Patients in the 450 mg/day pregabalin group showed significant improvements versus placebo in endpoint mean pain score (- 0. 56; p = 0. 0132), PGIC (73 % improved vs 56 % placebo; p = 0. 0017), and function [Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) total score - 5. 85; p = 0. 0012]. PGIC was also significant for 600 mg/day pregabalin (69 % improved; p = 0. 0227). Results for these endpoints were nonsignificant for pregabalin at 300 mg/day and for pain and FIQ score at 600 mg/day. Early onset of pain relief was seen, with separation from placebo detected by Week 1 in all pregabalin groups. All pregabalin doses demonstrated superiority to placebo on the Medical Outcomes Study-Sleep Scale Sleep Disturbance subscale and the Sleep Quality diary.

A 4 -week prospective multicenter open-label observational study was designed to explore and describe the combined effect of ibuprofen SR and standard medical care in patients suffering from osteoarthritis in 15 general medical practices in Egypt. Patients and methods: In total, 519 patients were prescribed ibuprofen SR 2 × 800 mg once daily for 4 weeks. Results: Ibuprofen SR combined with standard medical care significantly improved day and night pain, with 99. 4 % of the patients reporting improvement. The treatment reduced the symptom severity of joint tenderness/stiffness and the duration of morning stiffness, and allowed more patients to carry out normal activities.
