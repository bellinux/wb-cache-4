50|$|A DSL modem modulates {{high-frequency}} tones for transmission to a <b>digital</b> <b>subscriber</b> line <b>access</b> multiplexer (DSLAM), {{and receives}} and demodulates {{them from the}} DSLAM.

50|$|At the {{telephone}} exchange, the line generally terminates at a <b>digital</b> <b>subscriber</b> line <b>access</b> multiplexer (DSLAM) where another frequency splitter separates the voice band signal for the conventional phone network.

50|$|At the exchange, a <b>digital</b> <b>subscriber</b> line <b>access</b> {{multiplexer}} (DSLAM) terminates the DSL circuits and aggregates them, {{where they}} are handed off to other networking transports. In the case of ADSL, the voice component is also separated at this step, either by a filter integrated in the DSLAM or by a specialized filtering equipment installed before it. The DSLAM terminates all connections and recovers the original digital information.|$|R

50|$|Until {{the late}} 1990s, {{the cost of}} digital signal {{processors}} for DSL was prohibitive. All types of DSL employ highly complex digital signal processing algorithms to overcome the inherent limitations of the existing twisted pair wires.

40|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>subscriber</b> lines (xDSL) {{belong to}} a family of {{technologies}} that provide the ability to transmit digital data over local telephone (copper) infrastructure. As the second most popular broadband platform in the United States, {{it is estimated that}} over twenty-five million xDSL lines are in service, capturing nearly 30 percent of the U. S. broadband market. While the service range of xDSL is somewhat limited, often extending to a maximum of 18, 000 feet from a central office (CO), available bandwidth also decays as distance increases from the CO. As a result, there are often marked disparities in the quality of xDSL service within market areas. This article proposes a bi-objective location model for maximizing both service coverage and quality of coverage in siting <b>digital</b> <b>subscriber</b> line <b>access</b> multiplexers (DSLAMs).

40|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>subscriber</b> line (DSL) {{networks}} are currently enhanced to provide {{higher transmission rates}} and reliability {{in order to support}} emerging triple-play services, i. e., voice, video, and data. This is typically achieved by installing <b>digital</b> <b>subscriber</b> line <b>access</b> multiplexers (DSLAMs) in street cabinets to signi?cantly reduce the loop length to the subscribers. In addition, such DSLAMs typically employ DSL technologies that can use a wider spectrum for data transmission and thus effectively provide much higher transmission rates for short distances. The DSL performance is typically limited by crosstalk from the other lines in the bundle. Crosstalk can be mitigated by using spectrum coordination or signal coordination techniques, commonly referred to as dynamic spectrum management (DSM). This paper focuses on the concept and potential gains of signal coordination, known as DSM level 3, as well as the standardization efforts and considerations for future development and deployment of DSM level...|$|R
40|$|Asymmetric <b>digital</b> <b>subscriber</b> line (ADSL) is {{the latest}} copper-wire access {{technology}} that has the capability to deliver data rate up to 8 Mbps in downstream and up to 640 kbps in upstream.

40|$|Abstract: We {{present a}} five phases {{approach}} for the cost-efficient design of commu-nication platforms. We start with complete and executable {{models of the}} system func-tion that capture all essential parts of a reference application, i. e. processing kernels, data and control flow, and timing constraints. We analyze such an architecture-independent model to narrow the design space and derive a most flexible initial plat-form architecture. We map the model onto the platform hard- and software, and pro-file the system. Through iterations, the prototype is refined, until an architecture is found that meets performance and cost constraints. The resulting virtual prototype serves as executable specification {{for the design of}} the final system.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} to providing full-rate <b>digital</b> <b>subscriber</b> line (xDSL) <b>access</b> to residential customers in rural or remote locations {{is the use of}} existing copper infrastructure. First, copper is not particularly good for moving high frequencies over extended distances. Second, much of the existing copper in the United States is of diminished quality. Third, digital loop carriers, bridge taps, load coils, and ambient interference negatively impact data transmission. Because of these problems, the geographic reach of xDSL services is limited. To combat this limitation, providers are installing remote <b>digital</b> <b>subscriber</b> line <b>access</b> multiplexers (RDSLAMs). RDSLAMs seek to maximise the amount of demand covered for a peripheral neighborhood and aggregate this data traffic onto a fiber optic connection for transport back to the central office (CO) for switching. Although this is more feasible than constructing a new CO, acquiring the rights of way and installing fiber is expensive. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the complexities associated with locating RDSLAMs in a competitive telecommunications market through the use of an integer programming model—the remote access hierarchical assignment problem—and a geographic information system. Pertinent policy and technology related issues in residential broadband deployment and their impacts on high-speed services such as xDSL are highlighted. ...|$|R

In this paper we propose and demonstrate the applicability of the Rényi entropy as a useful diagnosis feature for explicitly characterizing DSL-level anomalies issued in an IPTV network of a large European ISP.
