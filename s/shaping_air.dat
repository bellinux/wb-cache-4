40|$|For {{high-quality}} {{spray painting}} of small parts, a rotary bell atomizer {{with a narrow}} spray pattern {{is used in the}} automotive industry. The required unusual high <b>shaping</b> <b>air</b> flow rate yields in an atomization process predominated by a pneumatic atomization and rather than by a rotary atomization, called hybrid bell atomizer in this article. Numerical and experimental investigation on typical high-speed rotary bell atomizers, with rotation type of high rotational speed 40000 - 60000 rpm of the bell, were already successful demonstrated. For these high-speed rotary bell atomizer for painting bigger areas the ratio between tangential velocity at the bell edge and axial <b>shaping</b> <b>air</b> velocity at the bell edge is in the range of 0. 8 and 4, depending on the process parameter. At the hybrid bell atomizer (10000 - 20000 rpm), this ratio is between 0. 2 and 0. 4. The first step of the present study includes the theoretical characterization of spray cone velocity profile using two definitions of swirl-number compared to experimental measurements of particle velocities using Laser-Doppler-Velocimetry (LDV). This study was carried out on varying <b>shaping</b> <b>air</b> settings and rotational speeds. The results show that the the swirl of the main airflow field is dominated by the secondary airflow, which is induced coaxial in an angle of 45 °. The influence of the circumferential speed of the bell cup on the swirl of the main airflow field plays a subordinate role, so the resulting spray pattern is only weakly influenced by the number of revolutions of the bell-cup. In the second step, the hybrid bell atomizer was examined numerically. In order to implement the hybrid atomization concept in the simulation correctly, methods for creating droplet initial conditions in the trajectory calculation was developed. The simulation results were verified through comparisons of calculated and measured velocity profiles inside the spray cone and calculated and measured film thickness distributions on the work piece. In the present investigations of the atomizer, it has been demonstrated numerically and experimentally that the airflow field of this hybrid bell atomizer is strongly impacted by the secondary <b>shaping</b> <b>air</b> and both the circumferential speed of the bell cup and the direct electrostatic charge on the bell have only a minor effect on the generated spray pattern and the resulting transfer efficiency...|$|E
40|$|International audienceElectrostatic rotary bell {{sprayers}} (ERBS) {{are widely}} used in automotive painting applications. These processes involve complex airflows to shape paint sprays and transport droplets toward automotive parts to be coated. Despite the importance of shaping airflow on global spray characteristics, a detailed characterization of this aerodynamic flow is still missing. For this purpose, an experimental study {{was conducted on the}} influence of some ERBS operating parameters on the development and characteristics of shaping airflow. Results show that, for low swirl numbers, the flow behavior is close to that of annular swirling jets and a good agreement is found between ERBS flow characteristics and data available in literature. When rotational speed of the bell cup is sufficiently fast, a change of regime is observed with a shift in the longitudinal flow development and an increase of recirculation zone length. This change of regime is attributed to vortex breakdown instability, known to occur when high swirl strength is beyond a critical value. Experimental results obtained in this study put forward a clear link between the <b>shaping</b> <b>air</b> flow rate and the rotation frequency on the aerodynamics and also provide valuable leads to design <b>shaping</b> <b>air</b> flow in modern ERBS...|$|E

40|$|The modern {{painting}} process in automotive industry {{is complex and}} a lot of factors affect the result. The trial and error method is used today to control the quality and introduce new colours. This method {{takes a lot of time}} and does not show any clear numbers of how the process is affected by changing the parameters. During this thesis, we have investigated a delimited number of parameters. The work is based on experiments performed on samples that represents a flat surface of the cab, to reduce experimental costs. Our master thesis is done at Scania in Oskarshamn, where all the cabs for the European production is produced. The objectives with this thesis has been to explain how the process parameters of the robotic applicator affect the paint distribution, paint thickness and the colour of the top coat. We also optimised the process by finding which settings gives an even paint distribution, a correct thickness and an accepted colour of the top coat. We have been using Design of Experiments to achieve the goals of this study. Design of Experiments is a statistic method that is used to perform experiments effectively. It also shows the effect of changing the factors from a low to a high level. We have chosen to divide the workflow into three parts: screening, optimisation and confirmation. The experiments are performed during the daily production to replicate the real circumstances. The <b>shape</b> <b>air,</b> paint flow and high rotation is the most important parameters to control. Paint flow also seems to have a linear impact on the thickness of the top coat layer. The <b>Shape</b> <b>air</b> and the high rotation on the other hand mainly affect the distribution of the top coat layer. Different levels are needed for the <b>shape</b> <b>air</b> and high rotation depending on what paint flow is used. The optimal settings of the factors for our colour were found to be paint flow at 82 %, the <b>shape</b> <b>air</b> at 90 %, the high rotation at 90 % and high voltage at 100 %. The optimal settings give a result of 1, 535 μm in spread and 40, 08 μm in mean thickness.

40|$|Evaporation {{of paint}} {{solvents}} {{is a significant}} part of a automobile 2 ̆ 7 s environmental footprint. Relationships between evaporation of droplets and application parameters were developed to optimize the spray process and reduce the environmental footprint by reducing paint waste in the booth. A Phase Doppler Anemometer (PDA) was used to calculate the evaporation of spray from a rotary bell atomizer (RBA). The change in volume flux between consecutive planes was found to be significant. The total evaporation when spraying water was 0. 93 cm 3 /s and 0. 46 cm 3 /s between 22. 5 - 30. 0 cm and 30. 0 - 37. 5 cm axial distances, respectively. Tests were performed to determine the effects on evaporation of water spray for three rotary bell atomizer operational parameters: <b>shaping</b> <b>air</b> flow rate, bell speed and liquid flow rate. Evaporation rate increased with higher flow rate and bell speed, but no statistically significant effects were obtained for <b>shaping</b> <b>air</b> flow rate or interactions between parameters. For clearcoat sprays, evaporation increased with increasing bell speed and increase of flow rate from 100 to 200 cm 3 /s. The combination of higher electrostatic potential and lower flow rate decreased the mean particle diameter. Particle mean velocity increased with increasing bell speed and flow rate. The trend of mean diameter decreasing with an increasing bell speed that was found in water and clearcoat, was also found for basecoat. However, the measurements with basecoat had a low statistical viability, and were deemed unsuitable for calculating the flux through parallel planes, which is required for calculating the evaporation. A model was proposed by combining two existing models from the literature; and the RBA nozzle parameter, K 1, and the evaporation rate, K, were calculated for water and clearcoat at 24 °C. K 1 was found constant for clearcoat but was flow rate and bell speed dependent for water. The value of K was found to be between 860 - 1270 μm 2 /s and 1300 - 2000 μm 2 /s for water and clearcoat, respectively. The initial particle diameter for different bell speeds and flow rates can be calculated using this RBA constant and the model. A model for the evaporation of droplets at any axial distance was also development...|$|E

40|$|A {{method of}} spray {{modeling}} and measurements for pharmaceutical pan tablet coating applications is proposed. It consists of (1) spatially resolved spray characterization and (2) computational predictions of subsequent spray evolution using CFD. Both (1) and (2) {{are in line}} with PAT guidelines that emphasize process understanding and analytical process design. ^ (1) utilizes a dual-mode Phase Doppler Anemometry (PDA) system. Data are obtained at multiple points covering the entire spray cross-sectional area. Measurements are validated by ensuring that PDA-measured mass flowrate matches measured mass flowrate and by comparing PDA-calculated absorptances to the optical patternator measured ones. ^ Experimental data show that drop size, velocity, and volume flux vary spatially throughout a spray cross-sectional area. Spatial variation in size and velocity do not significantly change with variations in spraying parameters. Drop size decreases with an increase in atomizing/shaping air pressure, a decrease in liquid supply rate, and a decrease in formulation concentration (viscosity). Drop velocities increase with an increase in atomizing air pressure, a decrease in liquid supply rate, a decrease in formulation concentration, and a decrease in gun-to-target distance. ^ In contrast to size and velocity distribution, spatial variation in volume flux is sensitive to changes in operating conditions. For elliptical sprays, an increase in <b>shaping</b> <b>air</b> pressure and an increase in liquid viscosity lead {{to the development of a}} dumbbell-shaped pattern. Increasing atomizing air pressure narrows the spray whereas increasing liquid supply rate produces a more elliptical spray. On the contrary, volume flux distributions for round sprays are significantly less sensitive to changes in either operating conditions or liquid viscosity. ^ (2) utilizes a commercially-available CFD package to predict how sprays evolve under drum coater conditions. Results show that drum rotation induces gas swirling that transports small drops away from the spray zone. It also lengthens the spray. Drying air promotes spray evaporation, therefore reducing local drop number density. Furthermore, since drying air enters from the top of the drum, it pushes the spray downward, leading to spray patterns that resemble the letter ‘C’. Drying air flow also helps reduce the effects of drum rotation on spray evolution by providing droplets with additional axial momentum. The additional momentum in turn increases droplet velocities. ^ Computed drop sizes and drop velocities generally agree well with measured data, but ∼ 46 % difference is observed when comparing measured and computed volume flux magnitude. Measured volume flux data, however, are likely less accurate due to the systematic limitations of the standard (Fiber) PDA system. ^ Results from (1) provide a comprehensive understanding on how changes in atomizer operational parameters influence spray characteristics and patterns, and on how drum coater parameters (drying air flow and drum rotational speed) influence the spray evolution process. Results from (2) provide a means to model spray evolution in the drum coater and to reinforce process understanding, particularly for the influence of drum rotation on drying air flow, and for the influence of process variables on spray pattern. ...|$|E
