5|$|Twenty-one {{companies}} were eventually formed and were employed digging subways, cable trenches, Sapping, dugouts {{as well as}} offensive or defensive mining. At {{the end of the}} war, Engineers were directly responsible for maintaining buildings and designing the infantry front-line fortifications and artillery positions, the telephones, wireless and other <b>signalling</b> <b>equipment,</b> railways, roads, water supply, bridges and transport. They also operated the railways and inland waterways.|$|E
5|$|The regiment, {{with three}} squadrons of tanks, {{would spend the}} next year in training, {{learning}} to use the <b>signalling</b> <b>equipment</b> and guns of the tanks it was expected to use. One squadron was to be equipped with Crusaders {{with the other two}} squadrons operating Shermans. However, the mechanically unreliable Crusaders were later replaced with Shermans. Burrows initially oversaw the transition to armour until he returned to New Zealand on furlough in May 1943 and was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel J. W. McKergow.|$|E

5|$|Together {{with the}} {{introduction}} of S Stock trains, the track, electrical supply and signalling systems are being upgraded in a programme planned to increase peak-hour capacity on the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines by 65 per cent by the end of 2018. A single control room for the sub-surface railway is to be established in Hammersmith and an automatic train control (ATC) system will replace <b>signalling</b> <b>equipment</b> installed from the 1940s. The cross-London Crossrail line, planned to open in 2018, is expected to reduce crowding between Paddington and Whitechapel.|$|E
5|$|Tunnelling was {{completed}} in December 1905, after which work continued {{on the construction of}} the station buildings and the fitting-out of the tunnels with tracks and <b>signalling</b> <b>equipment.</b> As part of the UERL group, the CCE obtained its electricity from the company's Lots Road Power Station, originally built for the electrification of the MDR; the proposed Chalk Farm generating station was not built. The final section of the approved route between Charing Cross and the Embankment was not constructed, and the southern terminus on opening was Charing Cross. After a period of test running, the railway was ready to open in 1907.|$|E
5|$|In {{an earlier}} {{disaster}} in May 1901, three underground explosions at the colliery killed 81 miners. The inquest {{established that the}} colliery had high levels of airborne coal dust, which would have exacerbated the explosion and carried it further into the mine workings. The cause of the 1913 explosion is unknown, but the subsequent inquiry thought the most likely cause was a spark from underground <b>signalling</b> <b>equipment</b> that could have ignited any firedamp present. The miners in {{the east side of}} the workings were evacuated, but the men in the western section bore the brunt of the explosion, fire and afterdamp—a poisonous mixture of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen left after an explosion.|$|E
40|$|In {{the history}} of railway <b>signaling,</b> <b>signal</b> <b>equipment</b> evolved with the {{development}} of electronics technologies from machines to relays, electricity, electrons, and computers. Especially, since the establishment of JR East, technological breakthroughs have enabled the establishment of innovative systems such as ATOS, COSMOS, and digital ATC with computer and network technologies. Signal control at front-line train operations, however, still relied on wiring technologies, and this caused transport disruptions on the Chuo line in September 2003. We have been developing a new network signal control system as a measure to deal with this problem, and this paper describes what kind of research and development will be demanded now and in the future. 1 Development of railway <b>signal</b> <b>equipment</b> follows a vicious circle pattern; new <b>signal</b> <b>equipment</b> is introduced after a major accident in order to avoid reoccurrence of the same kind of accidents, then a new accident that reveals blind spots of that new <b>signal</b> <b>equipment</b> occurs, and again, a new measure is implemented. In the early stage of <b>signal</b> <b>equipment</b> development, accidents triggered the introduction of new <b>signal</b> <b>equipment</b> to answer the question of how <b>signal</b> <b>equipment</b> should prevent accidents. Today, new systems are being developed based on the need to answer the question of how operation efficiency and customer service can be improved while maintaining safety. Control of signals and point switches installed at operation sites however had problems since they used old-style wiring technologies. In this paper, I would like us to review {{the history of}} railway signal systems, discuss the innovative systems that have been created so far, including not only train operations but also transportation that have been carried out since the establishment of JR East. Then I would like to clarify the current signal system problems, and describe what future signal systems should be like. 2 Special feature articl...|$|R

5|$|The 6S {{units were}} {{intended}} to be introduced into service in June 1957. On 5April a fire at Cannon Street signal box disabled all <b>signalling</b> <b>equipment</b> there. As a result, locomotive-hauled trains were banned from the station. A temporary signal box was commissioned on 5May and the 6S units were introduced on peak services the next day. Two units coupled together formed the 06:58 and 07:26 Hastings–Cannon Street services in the morning, and the 17:18 and 18:03 Cannon Street–Hastings services in the evening. From 17June the 6S and 6L units were working services throughout the day. The 6B units entered service between May and August 1958.|$|E

The locomotives were formerly 37100, 37170, 37178 and 37217 respectively. A new inspection shed was built in 2008 at Coleham (Sutton Bridge Junction) in Shrewsbury for these locos.|$|E
25|$|Together {{with the}} {{introduction}} of 7-car S Stock trains, the sub-surface track, electrical supply and signalling systems are being upgraded in a programme to increase peak-hour capacity on the District line by 24 per cent by the end of 2018. A single control room for the sub-surface network is to be established in Hammersmith which will begin operation in 2019. Trains will also be increased to 32 per hour in central London and to Barking during peak times in 2022.

25|$|Tryon was criticised by {{officers}} from the enemy fleet {{that he had not}} given due warning to merchant vessels before attacking, nor allowed their crews time to escape as required under international law. He had bombarded defenceless cities and 'killed' civilians, and it was claimed he used false flags and captured <b>signalling</b> <b>equipment.</b> He was praised by the Admiralty for his handling of the fleet, but his opponents in turn felt criticised for their failings. The public felt comforted that such an officer was really on the British side.|$|E
25|$|After the {{railways}} in Britain were privatised in 1994, staff from the then operating company, Railtrack, {{paid a visit}} to the Union Pacific Operating Center, USA in 1999. After viewing the facilities and seeing the control they decided that a handful of major operating centres was the way forward for UK operations. Just one centre was approved and built in 2003 at Saltley, near to Birmingham, as part of the West Coast Route Modernisation. However this building was not connected for some time and whilst it was used by Network Rail staff, no <b>signalling</b> <b>equipment</b> was installed until 2006.|$|E
25|$|Tests {{showed no}} <b>signalling</b> <b>equipment</b> faults and {{the report was}} able to dismiss the {{possibility}} that the signalman had only changed the route after the Perth train had passed the caution signal. The driver of the Perth train had not slowed his train in response to this signal and had then passed two danger signals before colliding with the Tring train. All the evidence suggested that the driver had made no attempt to stop until the very last moment: Eyewitnesses on board the Perth train reported that an emergency brake application was made a few seconds before the collision.|$|E
