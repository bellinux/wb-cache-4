Currently, {{there are}} major gaps in our {{understanding}} of the molecular interactions between S. homoeocarpa and creeping bentgrass. In this study, 454 sequencing technology was used in the de novo assembly of S. homoeocarpa and creeping bentgrass transcriptomes. Transcript sequence data obtained using Illumina’s first generation sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) were mapped to the transcriptome assemblies to estimate transcript representation in different SBS libraries. SBS libraries included a S. homoeocarpa culture control, a creeping bentgrass uninoculated control, and a library for creeping bentgrass inoculated with S. homoeocarpa and incubated for 96 h. A Fisher’s exact test was performed to determine transcripts that were significantly different during creeping bentgrass infection with S. homoeocarpa. Fungal transcripts of interest included glycosyl hydrolases, proteases, and ABC transporters. Of particular interest were the large number of glycosyl hydrolase transcripts that target a wide range of plant cell wall compounds, corroborating the suggested wide host range and saprophytic abilities of S. homoeocarpa. Several of the multidrug resistance ABC transporters may be important for resistance to both fungicides and plant defense compounds. Creeping bentgrass transcripts of interest included germins, ubiquitin transcripts involved in proteasome degradation, and cinnamoyl reductase, which is involved in lignin production.

40|$|A {{filamentous}} ascomycete fungus <b>Sclerotinia</b> homoeocarpa causes <b>dollar</b> <b>spot,</b> {{which is}} the most important disease of turfgrasses in the United States. Despite the increased number of reports of site-specific fungicide resistance and a recent report of multidrug resistance (MDR) in S. homoeocarpa field populations, the genetic mechanisms behind resistance or reduced sensitivity to fungicides remain poorly explained in the fungus. In order to prevent further development of fungicide resistance in the <b>dollar</b> <b>spot</b> pathosystem, a detailed elucidation of mechanisms of site-specific fungicide resistance and MDR is needed. In addition, the previous studies of MDR in fungi mostly focused on efflux transporter mediated drug/xenobiotic detoxification. However, the recent release of fungal genome sequences has revealed that ascomycete filamentous fungi including S. homoeocarpa possess a large number of cytochrome p 450 s (CYP 450 s) that are involved in xenobiotic metabolism. Chapters 2 and 3 of this dissertation describe demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicide/MDR mechanisms in S. homoeocarpa through Phase I xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (CYP 450 s) and Phase III efflux transporters using functional genomic and genetic techniques. We identified a fungal specific transcription factor (Shxdr 1) that regulates the Phase I and III genes and a novel gain of function mutation of the transcription factor found from a MDR field strain is responsible for constitutive and induced overexpression of the Phase I and III genes, resulting in MDR. In Chapter 4, the mechanisms of qualitative and quantitative resistance of a dicarboximide fungicide have been determined using field and lab mutant S. homoeocarpa strains. We confirmed that S. homoeocarpa field isolates gained qualitative and quantitative dicarboximide resistance through the polymorphism in the histidine kinase gene Shos 1 and the overexpression of ABC efflux transporter ShPDR 1, respectively. Chapter 5 studies the management of a S. homoeocarpa population with different combinations of resistance to dicarboximide, DMI, and benzimidazole fungicides to find the best fungicide options for controlling the S. homoeocarpa population and further understanding the dynamics of how the population responds to fungicide applications, and to long-term lack of exposure to fungicides during winter. Succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHI; fluxapyroxad and boscalid (high rate)), multi-site fungicide (fluazinam), and the fungicide mixture (chlorothalonil, iprodione, thiophanate methyl, and tebuconazole) controlled the S. homoeocarpa population very well. The isolates with resistance to DMI and dicarboximide were most frequently selected by iprodione or propiconazole applications and the isolates with resistance to DMI and benzimidazole were selected by boscalid applications, but these multiple fungicide resistant isolates decreased after overwintering...|$|R

40|$|<b>Dollar</b> <b>spot,</b> {{caused by}} the {{pathogen}} S. homoeocarpa (F. T. Bennett), is a common disease that infects {{a wide variety of}} turfgrasses all over the world. Yet it is significant problem on golf course putting greens and fairways consisting of creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) and annual bluegrass (Poa annua L.). It is active {{in a wide variety of}} environmental conditions ranging from 16 - 30 ˚C but favors warm, humid days, followed by cool nights. Sclerotinia homoeocarpa overwinters as dormant mycelium in dead plant tissue. In the spring, germinating mycelia begin to infect leaf blades causing foliar lesions, which then spread via mycelium by means of wind, rain, animals and equipment. While there are a number of cultural practices that can reduce disease severity, frequent fungicide applications are required to maintain acceptable playing conditions on a golf course. The repeated use of fungicides with the same mode of action has led to the development of fungicide resistance of S. homoeocarpa to certain fungicide classes. Most notably, demethylase inhibitor (DMI) fungicides have been found to have varying levels of inefficacy against S. homoeocarpa across North America. The cause for reduced efficacy is suspected to the shifted sensitivity levels of many S. homoeocarpa populations, which are resulted from repeated use of the DMI fungicide. Recently, “early-spring fungicide applications” targeting to reduce initial inoculum density of <b>dollar</b> <b>spot</b> have gained popularity in an attempt to reduce <b>dollar</b> <b>spot</b> severity. In addition, preventative fungicide applications (from late October through mid-November) containing DMI fungicides have been traditionally practiced to target snow molds (caused by Microdochium nivale, Typhula spp.) in the northeastern United States.

Glasshouse studies showed increasing Cl applied as CaCl? reduced Bipolaris cynodontis on Tifgreen bermudagrass by 20 % 1 week after inoculation and 30 % 2 weeks after inoculation as rates of Cl increased from 0 to 97. 6 kg ha??. <b>Dollar</b> <b>spot</b> infection of glasshouse-grown Tifgreen bermudagrass was reduced by 26 % and 33 % one and two weeks after infection as Cl applied a CaCl? increased from 0 to 97. 6 kg ha??. Increasing K applied as K?SO? reduced <b>dollar</b> <b>spot</b> by 26 % and 21 % one and two weeks after infection as rates of K increased from 24. 4 to 97. 6 kg ha??. Leaf tissue concentration of N was not affected by increasing rates of Cl applied as CaCl? or K applied as K?SO? increased from 0 to 97. 6 kg ha??. Leaf tissue K was not affected by Cl applied as CaCl? as rates went from 0 to 97. 6 kg ha?? and increasing K above 48. 8 kg ha?? did not increase leaf tissue K. Leaf tissue Cl decreased as K applied as K?SO? increased from 24. 4 to 97. 6 kg ha??. Leaf tissue N from 20 to 24 g kg??, K from 13 to 16 g kg??, and Cl from 4. 5 to 6 g kg?? had no effect on the infection by Bipolaris cynodontis on field-grown common bermudagrass...|$|R

Pest management in turf involves the use of fumigants such as methyl bromide, as well as selective pesticides. However, the loss of methyl bromide and development of disease resistance to fungicides suggests that more integrated practices are needed. Residual material from the extraction of oils of oriental mustard seed may provide an integrated approach. Research was conducted comparing the effects of MSM to dazomet on the germination of different weeds and turfgrasses. Comparisons were also conducted with MSM to iprodione to determine effectiveness for control of <b>dollar</b> <b>spot.</b> Finally, plant-back intervals with cool-season turfgrasses were identified following applications of MSM. Results indicate that plant counts and plant biomass were reduced from 19 to 81 % and 10 to 99 % for all weed and turfgrass species tested in both field and greenhouse experiments, respectively. Rates of MSM [lesser than] 840 kg/ha reduced <b>dollar</b> <b>spot</b> counts from 50 to 74 % compared to the untreated control and also increased overall turfgrass quality and color over time. Reductions in plant counts and biomass were observed for all cool-season turfgrasses tested when planted the same day following MSM applications. Tall fescue and perennial ryegrass were least sensitive to oriental mustard seed meal with no phytotoxic affects present when seeded 7 days after application of oriental mustard seed meal. From these results, MSM suppresses a number of weed and turfgrass species as well as <b>dollar</b> <b>spot</b> as rates of MSM increases. However {{more research is needed to}} determine effective MSM rates/ plant-back intervals...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} in a non-parametric setup {{whether a}} long-run relationship exists between monetary fundamentals and the <b>dollar</b> <b>spot</b> exchange rates for 19 countries. Although the Johansen's parametric approach failed {{to retrieve a}} long-relationship {{for any of the}} countries considered, the Bierens (1997 a) non-parametric approach suggests that there is one cointegrating relationship {{for the majority of the}} countries considered. In addition, the [1, - 1] cointegrating vector between the fundamentals and the log-level of the dollar exchange rate could not be rejected in the non-parametric formulation. ...|$|R

While the forward premium and the interest rate differential cointegrate in both the 3 month and 6 month markets, the data reject the formal restrictions of covered interest parity. Well defined error-correction mechanisms suggest that the forward premium bears the burden of adjustment to the long run cointegrating relationship and that past changes in the forward premium predict changes in the interest rate differential. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Dollar</b> <b>spot</b> disease, {{caused by}} the fungus Sclerotinia homoeocarpa F. T. Bennett is common on intensively managed {{creeping}} bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) and annual bluegrass (Poa annua L.), and other turfgrasses. Frequent chemical applications {{during the growing season}} are made to control this disease. Previous observations state that application of fungicides such as azoxystrobin can increase the level of disease within the same growing season. The {{purpose of this study was}} to quantify the extent of disease increase caused by an application of azoxystrobin the previous year. In three field tests on creeping bentgrass between 2005 and 2007, a single application of azoxystrobin in the late fall was found to increase the incidence of dollar plot several fold on treated plots in the following summer. In addition, this study also found a slight enhancement of <b>dollar</b> <b>spot</b> incidence on Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), which has not been previously reported. Although the cause of this disease enhancement is not known, the physical and chemical characteristics of azoxystrobin, along with turfgrass cultural practices and the finding of the longer term effect from this study, implies that the phenomenon stems from non-target effects on microbial populations of leaves or soil rather than a direct long term effect on the plants. Studies on phyllosphere communities may shed light on this phenomenon and point out directions for future research...|$|R
