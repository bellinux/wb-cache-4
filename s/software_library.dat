5|$|The Katamari series, {{which has}} long been PlayStation 2 {{exclusive}}s, found {{one of the more}} recent installments, Beautiful Katamari, exclusive to Xbox 360. These releases fueled rumors and fear that Final Fantasy XIII and Tekken 6, two highly anticipated exclusive PlayStation 3 games at the time, would also be available for Xbox 360, the PlayStation 3's primary competitor and at E3 2008, it was announced that Final Fantasy XIII would be simultaneously released on the Xbox 360 in Europe and North America; later on October 8, 2008, it was announced that Tekken 6 would also be releasing on the Xbox 360. After the multiplatform releases of these games, the fifth installment of the Metal Gear series, , has also been announced for the Xbox 360; L.A. Noire, which was announced as an exclusive since the beginning of its development, has also been released for the Xbox 360; Dark Souls, the spiritual successor to Demon's Souls, has also been released on Xbox 360; the Persona series, which {{has a long history of}} being PlayStation exclusive, found the seventh generation installment, Persona 4 Arena multiplatform; however, Metal Gear Solid 4, Yakuza 3, Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection ONLINE, and Disgaea 3: Absence of Justice still remain PlayStation 3 exclusives.

40|$|If {{the role}} of <b>software</b> <b>libraries</b> is to {{communicate}} information about software artefacts between software engineers, {{it is vital that}} the information be stored in such a manner as to be readily understandable. The designs of existing <b>software</b> <b>libraries</b> present several cognitive impediments to a software engineer, hindering the understanding of library organisation and content. In this paper, a focused review of existing <b>software</b> <b>libraries</b> is undertaken. Shortcomings of the designs of existing <b>software</b> <b>libraries</b> and resulting cognitive deficiencies are identified. The design problems to be discussed are: the hiding of underlying library structure, the inadequacy of component interfaces, the problems of querying large collections, and the subjective nature of component organisation. Having encountered these problems with existing <b>software</b> <b>libraries,</b> some avenues for alleviating them are identified.

25|$|The {{concept of}} the Switch came about as Nintendo's {{reaction}} to several quarters of financial losses into 2014, attributed to poor sales of its previous console, the Wii U, and market competition from mobile gaming. Nintendo's then-president Satoru Iwata pushed the company towards mobile gaming and novel hardware. The Switch's design is aimed at a wide demographic of video game players through the multiple modes of use. Nintendo opted to use more standard electronic components, such as a chipset based on Nvidia's Tegra line, to make development for the console easier for programmers and more compatible with existing game engines. As the Wii U had struggled to gain external support, leaving it with a weak <b>software</b> <b>library,</b> Nintendo preemptively sought the support of many third-party developers and publishers to help build out the Switch's game library alongside Nintendo's own first-party titles, including many independent video game studios. Prior to launch, Nintendo had announced that over 100 titles were in development by 70 developers.|$|E
25|$|After the Federal {{criminal}} investigation ended in 1996, Zimmermann {{and his team}} started a company to produce new versions of PGP encryption. They merged with Viacrypt (to whom Zimmermann had sold commercial rights and who had licensed RSA directly from RSADSI), which then {{changed its name to}} PGP Incorporated. The newly combined Viacrypt/PGP team started work on new versions of PGP encryption based on the PGP 3 system. Unlike PGP 2, which was an exclusively command line program, PGP 3 was designed from the start as a <b>software</b> <b>library</b> allowing users to work from a command line or inside a GUI environment. The original agreement between Viacrypt and the Zimmermann team had been that Viacrypt would have even-numbered versions and Zimmermann odd-numbered versions. Viacrypt, thus, created a new version (based on PGP 2) that they called PGP 4. To remove confusion about how it could be that PGP 3 was the successor to PGP 4, PGP 3 was renamed and released as PGP 5 in May 1997.|$|E

500|$|The Nintendo DSi {{received}} generally positive reviews. Critics praised {{many of the}} console's {{changes to}} the DS Lite's aesthetic and functionality, but complained that it launched with insufficient exclusive software. IGN's Craig Harris noted that the DSi-exclusive <b>software</b> <b>library</b> and DSi Shop were lacking in content even after five months on the Japanese market. Jeff Bakalar of CNET said that owners of the original DS should consider buying a DSi, but that its only incentive for DS Lite owners was the DSi Shop. PCWorld New Zealand's Jan Birkeland shared Bakalar's opinion, but {{believed that it was}} too early to judge the quality of DSi Shop software. Many critics were disappointed by the removal of the GBA cartridge slot, but some of them, such as PCWorlds Darren Gladstone, Bit-techs Joe Martin, and IGN's Harris and Lowe, believed that it was a reasonable exchange for SD card support and the DSi Shop. However, Bakalar stated, [...] "We'd gladly give up the 4 millimeters [...] {{to be able to play}} any Game Boy Advance game." ...|$|E
500|$|Released in 1988, the Sega Genesis (known as the Sega Mega Drive in Japan, Europe and Brazil) was Sega's {{entry into}} the fourth {{generation}} of video game consoles. Selling 30.75 million units worldwide, the Genesis was the most successful console Sega ever released. The successor to the Genesis, the Sega Saturn, was released in Japan in 1994. The Saturn was a CD-ROM-based console that displayed both 2D and 3D computer graphics, but its complex dual-CPU architecture {{made it more difficult}} to program for than its chief competitor, the Sony PlayStation. Although the Saturn debuted before the PlayStation in both Japan and the United States, its surprise U.S. launchâwhich came four months earlier than originally scheduledâwas marred by a lack of distribution, which remained a continuing problem for the system. Moreover, Sega's early release was undermined by Sony's simultaneous announcement that the PlayStation would retail for US$299âcompared to the Saturn's initial price of $399. Nintendo's long delay in releasing a competing 3D console and the damage done to Sega's reputation by poorly supported add-ons for the Genesis (particularly the Sega 32X) allowed Sony to establish a foothold in the market. The PlayStation was immediately successful in the U.S., in part due to a massive advertising campaign and strong third-party support engendered by Sony's excellent development tools and liberal $10 licensing fee. Sony's success was further aided by a price war in which Sega lowered the price of the Saturn from $399 to $299 and then from $299 to $199 in order to match the price of the PlayStationâeven though Saturn hardware was more expensive to manufacture and the PlayStation enjoyed a larger <b>software</b> <b>library.</b> Losses on the Saturn hardware contributed to Sega's financial problems, which saw the company's revenue decline between 1992 and 1995 as part of an industry-wide slowdown. [...] Furthermore, Sega's focus on the Saturn over the Genesis prevented it from fully capitalizing on the continued strength of the 16-bit market.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} {{the design of}} modern numerical linear algebra problem solving environments. Particular {{emphasis is placed on}} three essential components out of which such environments are constructed, namely well-designed numerical <b>software</b> <b>libraries,</b> <b>software</b> tools that generate optimized versions of a collection of numerical kernels for various processor architectures, and software systems that transform disparate, loosely-connected computers and <b>software</b> <b>libraries</b> into a unified, easy-to-access computational service. A brief description of the "pioneers", namely the EISPACK and LINPACK <b>software</b> <b>libraries</b> as well as their successor, the Linear Algebra PACKage (LAPACK), illustrates the essential importance of block-partitioned algorithms for shared-memory, vector, and parallel processors.
