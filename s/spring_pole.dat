5000|$|The {{origin of}} turning dates to around 1300 BCE when the Ancient Egyptians first {{developed}} a two-person lathe. One person {{would turn the}} wood work piece with a rope while the other used a sharp tool to cut shapes in the wood. Ancient Rome improved the Egyptian design {{with the addition of}} a turning bow. In the Middle Ages a pedal replaced hand-operated turning, allowing a single person to rotate the piece while working with both hands. The pedal was usually connected to a pole, often a straight-grained sapling. The system today is called the [...] "spring pole" [...] lathe. <b>Spring</b> <b>pole</b> lathes were in common use into the early 20th century.|$|E
50|$|The archaeological {{record of}} {{woodturning}} {{is limited to}} illustrations because wood is a fiber prone to rot. Egyptian monuments illustrate a strap used by a helper to rotate the lathe while another worker cut the wood. Early bow lathes and strap lathes were developed and used in Egypt and Rome. The Chinese, Persians, and Arabs had their own variations of the bow lathe. Early lathe workers would sometimes use their bare feet to hold cutting tools in place while using their hand to power the lathe. Bow lathes continue in use {{right up to the}} present day, and much of our information about them comes from watching turners use them. Between 500 and 1500 A.D., turned wooden vessels served as the everyday bowls and cups of most of the population of Europe. Our knowledge of these humble vessels comes from bowls excavated from shipwrecks, such as the Mary Rose and the Oseberg burial ship, or dug out of deep wells, where they were preserved in a nonaerobic environment. Much of this ware was turned from green wood on a <b>spring</b> <b>pole</b> lathe. Finely crafted drinking bowls, known as Mazers, were produced in very limited quantities from dry wood, then decorated with gilded rims.|$|E

40|$|California ranks {{second in}} the nation, behind Florida, in {{production}} of fresh market tomatoes. ● In the U. S., approximately 31 % of fresh market tomatoes are grown in California. ● In 1996, fresh market tomatoes ranked twenty-first in value among all California agricultural commodities (10). ● A total of 1, 162, 800, 000 pounds of fresh market tomatoes were produced on approximately 40, 800 acres in California in 1997. The average yield was 28, 500 pounds (14. 25 tons) per acre (10). ● The average price paid for packed and loaded fresh tomatoes in 1997 was $ 0. 27 per pound. The total cash value of the 1997 crop was $ 313, 956, 000 (10). This would equate to an average cash value (gross) of $ 7, 695 per acre. Production Regions About 45 % of the state's fresh market tomatoes are produced in San Joaquin, Stanislaus and Merced counties. Nearly all the fresh market tomatoes produced {{in this area are}} from bush varieties. Planting of fresh market tomatoes is from February to June with harvest from mid-July to late October. The San Joaquin Valley south of Merced County produces about 30 % of the fresh market tomatoes. Cherry tomatoes are grown in some areas of Fresno southward.

40|$|A {{breeding}} vectors {{approach is}} used to investigate {{the hypothesis that the}} Martian atmosphere is predictable at certain times of year, by identifying the fastest-growing modes of instability ar different times in a Mars general-circulation model. Results indicate that the period from northern mid-spring until mid-autumn is remarkably predictable, with negative global growth rates for a range of conditions, in contrast to the situation on the earth. From northern late autumn to early spring growing modes do occur, peaking in northern high latitudes and near winter solstice. Reducing the size of the initial perturbations increases global growth rates in most cases, supporting the idea that instabilities which saturate nonlinearly at lower amplitudes have generally faster growth rates. In late autumn/early winter the fastest-growing modes ('bred vectors') are around the north pole, increase with dust loading, and probably grow via barotropic as well as baroclinic energy conversion. In northern late winter/early spring the bred vectors are around the north pole and are strongly baroclinic in nature. As dust loading (and with it the global circulation strength) is increased their growth rates first decrease, as the baroclinic mode is suppressed, then increase again as the fastest-growing instabilities switch to being those which dominated earlier in the year. If dust levels are very low during late northern autumn (late southern spring) then baroclinic modes are also found around the <b>spring</b> <b>pole</b> in the south, though for a slight increase in dust loading the dominant modes shift back to northern high latitudes. The bred vectors are also used as perturbations to the initial conditions for ensemble simulations. One possible application within the Mars model is as a means of identifying regions and times when dust-lifting activity (related to surface wind stress) might show significant interannual variability for a given model configuration, without the need to perform long, computationally expensive multi-year model runs with each new set-up. This is tested for a time of year when previous multi-year experiments showed significant variability in dust storm onset in the region north of Chryse. Despite the model having no feedbacks between dust lifting and atmospheric state (unlike the original multi-year mn), the ensemble members still show maximum divergence in this region in terms of near-surface wind stress, suggesting both that this application deserves further testing, and that the intrinsic atmospheric variability alone may be important in producing interannual variability in this storm type. © Royal Meteorological Society, 2004...|$|E

50|$|A pole lathe is a wood-turning lathe {{that uses}} a long pole as a return spring for a treadle. Pressing the treadle with your foot pulls on a cord that is wrapped around the piece of wood or billet being turned. The {{other end of the}} cord reaches up {{to the end of a}} long springy pole. As the action is reciprocating, the work rotates in one {{direction}} and then back the other way. Cutting is only carried out on the down stroke of the treadle, the <b>spring</b> of the <b>pole</b> only being sufficient to return the treadle to the raised position ready for the next down stroke. Modern pole lathes often replace the springy pole with an elastic bungee cord.|$|R

This type of starter eliminated the solenoid, {{replacing it with}} a movable pole shoe and a separate starter relay. This starter operates as follows: The driver turns the key, activating the starter switch. A small electric current flows through the solenoid actuated starter relay, closing the contacts and sending large battery current to the starter motor. One of the pole shoes, hinged at the front, linked to the starter drive, and spring-loaded away from its normal operating position, is swung into position by the magnetic field created by electricity flowing through its field coil. This moves the starter drive forward to engage the flywheel ring gear, and simultaneously closes a pair of contacts supplying current {{to the rest of the}} starter motor winding. Once the engine starts and the driver releases the starter switch, a <b>spring</b> retracts the <b>pole</b> shoe, which pulls the starter drive out of engagement with the ring gear.|$|R
60|$|They {{were very}} fond of horses. The {{standard}} of Kent was {{the picture of a}} white horse. They could break them in and manage them wonderfully well. Indeed, the horses (of which they had an abundance, though they were rather small) were so well taught in those days, that they can scarcely be said to have improved since; though the men are so much wiser. They understood, and obeyed, every word of command; and would stand still by themselves, in all the din and noise of battle, while their masters went to fight on foot. The Britons could not have succeeded in their most remarkable art, without the aid of these sensible and trusty animals. The art I mean, is the construction and management of war-chariots or cars, for which they have ever been celebrated in history. Each of the best sort of these chariots, not quite breast high in front, and open at the back, contained one man to drive, and two or three others to fight--all standing up. The horses who drew them were so well trained, that they would tear, at full gallop, over the most stony ways, and even through the woods; dashing down their masters' enemies beneath their hoofs, and cutting them to pieces with the blades of swords, or scythes, which were fastened to the wheels, and stretched out beyond the car on each side, for that cruel purpose. In a moment, while at full speed, the horses would stop, at the driver's command. The men within would leap out, deal blows about them with their swords like hail, leap on the horses, on the <b>pole,</b> <b>spring</b> back into the chariots anyhow; and, {{as soon as they were}} safe, the horses tore away again.|$|R
40|$|International audienceGlobal {{distributions}} of profiles of sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6) have been retrieved from limb emission spectra {{recorded by the}} Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) on Envisat covering the period September 2002 to March 2004. Individual SF 6 profiles have a precision of 0. 5 pptv below 25 km altitude and a vertical resolution of 4 ? 6 km up to 35 km altitude. These data have been validated versus in situ observations obtained during balloon flights of a cryogenic whole-air sampler. For the tropical troposphere a trend of 0. 227 ± 0. 008 pptv/yr has been derived from the MIPAS data, which is in excellent agreement with the trend from ground-based flask and in situ measurements from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Earth System Research Laboratory, Global Monitoring Division. For the data set currently available, based on {{at least three days}} of data per month, monthly 5 ° latitude mean values have a 1 ? standard error of 1 %. From the global SF 6 distributions, global daily and monthly {{distributions of}} the apparent mean age of air are inferred by application of the tropical tropospheric trend derived from MIPAS data. The inferred mean ages are provided for the full globe up to 90 ° N/S, and have a 1 ? standard error of 0. 25 yr. They range between 0 (near the tropical tropopause) and 7 years (except for situations of mesospheric intrusions) and agree well with earlier observations. The seasonal variation of the mean age of stratospheric air indicates episodes of severe intrusion of mesospheric air during each Northern and Southern polar winter observed, long-lasting remnants of old, subsided polar winter air over the <b>spring</b> and summer <b>poles,</b> and a rather short period of mixing with midlatitude air and/or upward transport during fall in October/November (NH) and April/May (SH), respectively, with small latitudinal gradients, immediately before the new polar vortex starts to form. The mean age distributions further confirm that SF 6 is destroyed in the mesosphere to a considerable amount. Model calculations with the Karlsruhe simulation model of the middle atmosphere (KASIMA) chemical transport model agree well with observed global distributions of the mean age only if the SF 6 sink reactions in the mesosphere are included in the model...|$|R
40|$|Though {{sporadic}} arrivals of Poles {{into the}} United States had started much earlier, it was onl y in 1854 that Polish immigration {{led to the}} establishment of the first self-contained Polish community and parish. It was perhaps a trick played by history that the first settlements of Silesian <b>Poles</b> <b>sprang</b> up in the San Antonio area of Texas rather than in an area such as Connecticut, which in many respects is geographically more like Poland. The large stream of Polish immigrants arriving in this country {{in the latter part of}} the nineteenth century and in the early twentieth moved to the American Northeast and Midwest, where the majority of Polish immigrants (largely of peasant origin) joined the ranks of industrial workers. Thus the oldest Polish settlements in Texas form a separate chapter in polish-American immigration history. They are unique because frontier life in Texas was so different from Silesia at that time. Moreover, the rural, isolated character of their colony allowed the settlers to preserve many old cultural traits until the present day. Journalists, historians, linguists, and other scholars have been fascinated by the Texas Poles and stimulated to do research on them. T. Lindsay Baker, a young Texan-born historian of non-Polish ethnic background, stands out among these researchers as the most thorough and perhaps most dedicated in his efforts to reconstruct and document the life of Silesian Poles in Texas. The book first treats the Upper Silesian origins of the group, the founding of the settlement, and Polish life on the frontier. Separate chapters analyze the impact of the Civil War and Reconstruction on the colonies, the growth and development of Silesian institutions and settlements, and the Silesian way of life in Texas. The book ends with chapters on the twentieth-century experience and the significance of the Texas Silesians. Each chapter is buttressed by numerous references to archival materials, old newspaper articles, and personal interviews. It seems that in his efforts to collect materials Baker has not left one stone unturned. Baker achieves a high degree of objectivity. For example, his description of eminent Poles such as Peter Kiolbassa is balanced by the inclusion of an outlaw such as Martin Mroz. In general, however, Baker interprets the Silesians sympathetically. Of greatest interest to many readers may be his portrayal of Silesian way of life in Texas in which he describes some of the customs still flavored with Silesian influences, such as weddings and funerals, as well as the pioneering work on the farms of Texas. The First Polish Americans: Silesian Settlements in Texas is a valuable contribution to the historical study of immigration and should be highly recommended reading for ethnic heritage programs...|$|R
