5000|$|Another {{variation}} {{is called a}} reverse tooth blade. On reverse tooth blades, the bottom 3/4" [...] of the teeth are reversed (point up). This arrangement helps to reduce splintering on the bottom edges of the cut. However, it does not clear sawdust out of the cut {{as well as a}} regular blade, so cutting is slower and produces more heat. This heat reduces blade life and makes scorching of the workpiece more likely. Reverse tooth blades are especially useful when cutting <b>softwood</b> and <b>plywood</b> such as Baltic birch.|$|R
5000|$|During 1990 {{sales and}} {{profits in the}} company's <b>softwood</b> lumber, <b>plywood,</b> and {{building}} products areas slumped due to weakening demand. This situation was attributed to an economic downturn, increasing concerns over the U.S. federal budget deficit, and fears about the unsettled global geopolitical environment. The construction industry suffered because of bankers' reluctance to finance new projects and consumers' decisions to delay home purchases. Housing starts for 1990 fell to 1.19 million, the lowest level since 1982 and down 13.3 percent from 1989. [...] LP responded to these developments by curtailing production at many of its plants and increasing exports of its specialty building products.|$|R

5000|$|Hardwoods are {{employed}} in a large range of applications, including fuel, tools, construction, boat building, furniture making, musical instruments, flooring, cooking, barrels, and manufacture of charcoal. Solid hardwood joinery tends to be expensive compared to softwood. In the past, tropical hardwoods were easily available, but the supply of some species, such as Burma teak and mahogany, is now becoming scarce due to over-exploitation. Cheaper [...] "hardwood" [...] doors, for instance, now consist of a thin veneer bonded to a core of <b>softwood,</b> <b>plywood</b> or medium-density fibreboard (MDF). Hardwoods {{may be used in}} a variety of objects, but are most frequently seen in furniture or musical instruments because of their density which adds to durability, appearance, and performance. Different species of hardwood lend themselves to different end uses or construction processes. This is due to the variety of characteristics apparent in different timbers, including density, grain, pore size, growth and fibre pattern, flexibility and ability to be steam bent. For example, the interlocked grain of elm wood (Ulmus spp.) makes it suitable for the making of chair seats where the driving in of legs and other components can cause splitting in other woods.|$|E

Specimens were sawn at a constant feed per tooth (0.05 mm) using two saw speeds. The mass concentration of airborne dust of diameter 7.07 μm or less (respirable dust) was measured with a light-scattering dust monitor. The mass concentration showed a log-normal distribution, and the geometric means of mass concentration at saw speeds of 2000 and 3000 rpm were 2.33 and 2.89 mg/m 3 for tropical hardwood plywood, 1.13 and 2.84 mg/m 3 for particleboard, 0.91 and 2.28 mg/m 3 for medium-density fiberboard, 1.09 and 1.38 mg/m 3 for <b>softwood</b> <b>plywood,</b> and 0.32 and 0.66 mg/m 3 for sugi lumber.

5|$|Various beetles in the Bostrichoidea {{superfamily}} {{attack the}} dry, seasoned wood used as structural timber in houses {{and to make}} furniture. In most cases, it is the larvae that do the damage; these are invisible from {{the outside of the}} timber, but are chewing away at the wood in the interior of the item. Examples of these are the powderpost beetles, which attack the sapwood of hardwoods, and the furniture beetles, which attacks <b>softwoods,</b> including <b>plywood.</b> The damage has already been done by the time the adult beetles bore their way out, leaving neat round holes behind them. The first that a householder knows about the beetle damage is often when a chair leg breaks off or a piece of structural timber caves in. Prevention is through chemical treatment of the timber prior to its use in construction or in furniture manufacture.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the years}} a {{significant}} decline in employment {{had occurred in}} the Douglas-fir region’s lumber and wood products industry. High levels of unemployment can lead to undesirable economic and social effects. An {{understanding of the nature}} of unemployment can facilitate future planning as well as mitigating current problems. This study has attempted to examine the underlying causes of employment decline in the region’s <b>softwood</b> lumber and <b>plywood</b> industries, specifically over the period 1979 - 86. This time span is of particular importance since there was a rapid decline in employment levels after 1979. There has been much controversy over the causes of this reduction but no comprehensive empirical analysis was ever undertaken to determine its cause. Meanwhile levels of output, which also declined in the early part of this span, have again reached pre-recession levels. A cost function approach was employed as the basis of the empirical analysis. The results suggest that most of the employment decline in these industries has been caused by changes in the structure of production and by increasing labour productivity. Although there are indications of cyclical unemployment, much of the reduction in the industries 2 ̆ 7 labour force seems to be attributable to greater substitution of capital and logs for labour. Simulation analyses tend to suggest that changes in factor prices would not have had any dramatic effect on employment levels. It was found that of the recent employment decline in the two industries, around one-quarter of the loss in the lumber industry and one-third in the plywood industry are caused by cyclical forces. Structural factors were assumed to be the cause of the remaining loss in levels of labour input...|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} a multiregional {{model of the}} soft wood forest products industry in the United States, designed to describe the dynamics of interregional competition in the industry and to provide means for policy experimentation and short-term projection of regional market shares. Two products (<b>softwood</b> lumber and <b>plywood),</b> five product supply regions (including Canada), and six product demand regions are recognized. The design of the model {{is based on a}} combined top-down/bottom-up approach and consists of three interdependent components: (1) the aggregate product market, (2) regional product markets, and (3) regional factor markets. Model solutions are obtained by the simultaneous determination of national level product prices and quantities and allocation of equilibrium quantities across producing regions {{on the basis of their}} relative prices and locational advantage. The model is evaluated in an historical simulation using data for 1950 - 84. Graphical analysis of simulated series suggests that the model replicates short-run trends as well as cyclical movements in aggregate demand and regional market shares. The results indicate that the short-run impacts of relative prices and locational advantage on regional market shares are generally small. Price responsiveness of regional market shares for lumber appear to be considerably lower than that of plywood, indicating greater degrees of regional substitution in the plywood market. The forecasting application of the model is demonstrated by extrapolating the complete structure for two years beyond the sample period. The projected trend during this two-year period is one of increasing demand for both lumber and plywood. Domestic producers 2 ̆ 7 shares of the lumber market are expected to remain relatively stable. The results show that nearly all increases in demand for lumber in this period will be satisfied by Canadian imports...|$|R

40|$|Current {{tariffs on}} wood {{products}} {{act as a}} barrier to trade. They restrict market access to more efficient producers. When a multilateral tariff elimination policy is simulated with a global trade model the results project greater trade activity in softwood lumber and plywood, and a greater market share for the US, Canada and European producers. Smaller but similar effects are found in the hardwood sector. The scenario analysis also suggests the possibility that, in the short term, tariff elimination may not lead to increase global consumption. A tariff elimination policy may result in a strong demand effect in the North American market, and, as a result, may lead to higher prices. Supply tightness may come from either stronger than expected demand growth and restrictions on supply availability in North America. Demand rigidity in Asian economies for lumber and plywood lead to positive, but small consumption gains with tariff liberalization. Initial changes in softwood lumber trade flows reach 20 % from baseline dropping to 13 % by 2010. The result suggests that tariffs in softwood lumber have restricted markets mostly for North American and European producers. Because the North American, particularly the US market, and Europe are also the major consumers of softwood lumber, a tariff elimination scenario results in greater international demand for their products raising domestic prices and lowering domestic consumption. This reduction in North American and European domestic consumption outweighs consumption gains in Japan, Australia and Mexico, regions where tariff elimination occurs. The current economic outlook for Asia is likely having a strong influence on the above result. Baseline results suggest a strong demand in the US while Asian consumption has fallen. The current global market condition has raised product prices in the US and lowered prices in Asia, an effect expected from lowering tariffs, but due to different forces. With an expanding US domestic markets and little consumption growth in Asian, the tariff elimination policy places further upward price pressure on US consumers as US and other producers shift some production from domestic to international markets. A further strengthening of foreign demand through a tariff elimination scenario reinforces upward price pressures affecting consumers in the US. Hence, the simulation suggests a global consumption decline in the short term with a price rise in the North American and European markets. This result suggests low cost producers are constrained from meeting expanded demand from tariff liberalization in the short run. A dominant North American market characterizes the global <b>softwood</b> <b>plywood</b> sector. The simulation results suggest that tariff elimination in the <b>softwood</b> <b>plywood</b> sector increases trade activity as well as global consumption and production. The US, a major consumer and producer of <b>softwood</b> <b>plywood,</b> acts as an exporter reducing its consumption and increasing output. As such the US dominates the response from a tariff elimination scenario in the model. Since many of the producing sectors outside the US have exogenous behavior for this sector, production changes in the model are limited. The limited production capacity outside North America for <b>softwood</b> <b>plywood</b> is likely to lessen the importance from these exogenous production constraints. Tariff effects on plywood trade are substantial percentage-wise; they reach 8 % immediately and attain 14 % by 2010. <b>Softwood</b> <b>plywood</b> is viewed as a mature product in decline being replaced by alternative engineered materials. Production capacity expansion in these engineered materials outside the U. S. are more likely to lessen the expanded production and consumption associated with the simulated tariff elimination policy in <b>softwood</b> <b>plywood.</b> Currently, fiberboard and reconstituted products are projected exogenously in CGTM. Tariff elimination in the softwood lumber and plywood sectors has a direct impact on the sawlog and pulpwood sectors. There is little evidence of any substantial effect from a tariff elimination policy in the softwood sawlog sector and no recorded changes in the pulpwood sector due to tariff elimination. This is because tariffs currently exist in countries with limited market behavior, such as China, or with small trade flows such as Mexico. Hence, changes observed in the log sector are driven primarily by the softwood lumber tariff elimination. Softwood log trade is lower under the tariff elimination policy. Changes in trade activity in the softwood log sector reach 8 % from baseline due to lumber and plywood tariff elimination. Hardwood sector results are smaller than the softwood sector impacts. Assumptions regarding China’s consumptive behavior have a strong influence on the results. Sensitivity analysis with higher Chinese consumption projects greater imports originating from nearby Asian countries. Otherwise, much of the increase in production would come from the US. The above results suggests the major part of increased softwood harvests would involve Canadian forests which are mostly natural followed by secondary forests in the US and Europe. Depending on Chinese consumption changes, the major increase in hardwood harvests would originate from Southeast Asian producers under high Chinese consumption growth. Otherwise, the increase in hardwood consumption would flow from US forests...|$|E

40|$|Widely differing {{theoretical}} expectations exist {{concerning the}} economic performance of labor-managed firms or producer cooperatives (PCs). While {{a good number}} of theoretical studies of these firms by economists have been undertaken, there remain considerable gaps in the empirical record. This is especially true in the case of American PCs. In general, theoretical controversies have not been tempered by enough empirical analysis. While some expect good performance from PCs, others are much less sanguine. This study compares the economic performance of a group of eight worker-owned producer co-op plants with that of eight conventional mills in the Pacific Northwest <b>softwood</b> <b>plywood</b> industry. The purpose is to test the validity of several propositions that are typically maintained in the analysis of PCs suggesting that this type of organization basically lacks the incentive to utilize labor inputs efficiently, and is therefore less productive when compared to conventionally organized producing units. Using secondary data, pooled time-series cross-section equations are estimated. Results indicate that growth in annual output per employee per year is 18 percent greater in the co-ops than in their conventional counterparts. The study provides strong evidence that the two groups of plants differ significantly in their behavior. The major conclusion that emerges is that worker-owned co-ops are a viable and productive form of economic organization that utilize labor inputs efficiently and in doing so can achieve higher worker productivity than their conventional counterparts. In a public policy context, government support of employee ownership and establishment of worker-owned co-ops is viewed as a viable policy option to plant closings...|$|E
40|$|The forest-products {{industries}} {{are most important}} {{to the state of}} Oregon. Oregon leads the nation in the production of plywood, lumber, and particle board. More than half of <b>softwood</b> <b>plywood</b> production in the United States came from Oregon {{at the time of this}} survey, and more than a fifth of the lumber and about a third of the particle board were produced in Oregon. Over 90 percent of the logs harvested in the state at the time of this survey were destined for sawmills and plywood plants. In producing lumber and plywood from logs, less than half of the entering log volume emerges as the finished primary product. That portion of the log remaining consists of such items as bark, sawdust, shavings, slabs; veneer trim, plywop-dArim, cores, and sander dust. This portion that remains after primary manufacture frequently is called residue. f Ouch of this residue formerly was considered waste and usually was disposed of by burning. But now a large portion of this residue material is recovered for other uses-primarily as raw material for paper and wood-composition board manufacture. If residue is not used, it presents a problem of disposal within allowable limits of pollution ! Because these residue materials are a valuable raw material, we conducted a survey of virtually all sawmills and plywood plants in the state to determine how these residues were being used; to point out what quantities might be available for future use; and to note the changes that had occurred in residue usage since previous surveys. An additional objective was to obtain information on a material balance' for sawmill and plywood plants, so that conversion factors could be developed for estimating average quantities of different types of residue generated from a given production of lumber or plywood. From these conversion factors, the average amount of a given type of residue that might be expected in producing a given board footage of lumber or a given square footage of plywood can be estimated...|$|E
40|$|The {{consequences}} of decisions regarding {{the management of}} forest resources in Oregon are local, national and international. This {{is to say that}} unilateral policies implemented to achieve an objective associated with Oregonian forest management programs will have unintended consequences elsewhere. This study examines the unintended consequences that arise from a simulated policy to maintain Oregon’s harvest levels constant over the next 4 decades. Forest economies other than Oregon and their associated environments are affected by our local choices. With a projected increase in the demand for wood products, {{what does it mean for}} Oregon to constrain its participation by restraining timber harvest? This study projects a future scenario for the global forest sector with and without Oregon’s increased participation to describe the impact the Oregon forest sector has on national and international markets. It also discusses several potential impacts on the environment associated with the changes in wood flows. This study addresses the following questions: What does a reduction in Oregon’s timber output mean for forest products markets locally, across the US and internationally? Which regions pick up the market share vacated by Oregon? What tradeoffs exist between timber production and the environment? What is Oregon’s role in providing forest products, environmental protection, social and economic benefits into the future for its citizens and the global community? To estimate the effect of Oregon’s annual harvest level on US and foreign markets, we first analyze the future demand for wood products to 2040, and identify the producers of wood products that meet this demand. We next constrain the annual harvest level in Oregon to be constant throughout the projection period (2000 to 2040), and note the changes in harvest volumes in markets outside of Oregon. Once recorded, environmental measures for the areas that increase harvest activities are examined. We also note the potential social and economic benefits associated with changes in market shares. An estimate of future global demand for wood fiber is based on annual projections of gross domestic product (GDP) of 3. 5 % and two historical trends in consumption of wood fiber. Consumption is estimated to reach between 2. 0 and 2. 8 billion cubic meters (Bm 3) over the next 5 decades, adding from 0. 5 to 1. 3 Bm 3 by the end of the 50 -year period. Many regions participate in meeting this growing demand for wood products, including Oregon, in this business-as-usual scenario. Focusing on softwood saw logs, the South contributes over 100 million cubic meters (MMm 3) or 17. 7 billion board feet (BBF) followed by Canada (40 MMm 3 or 7. 1 BBF) and the US West (including Oregon) (10 MMm 3 or 1. 8 BBF). This study estimates that the southern states will meet more than half of the projected demand growth. When Oregon’s annual harvest levels are maintained constant—i. e. harvest levels are not allowed to expand to meet the projected demand growth—two effects occur in the market. The first effect is an increase in timber prices. This is followed by responses from other regions and alternative material producers to increase production. The South captures 43 % of the decline in Oregon’s annual harvest levels. Alternative material producers—i. e. lost wood demand—capture 32 % of the lost market. They are followed by Asia and Canada, which capture 15 % and 10 % respectively of the projected demand growth without an increase in Oregon’s annual harvest levels. These results suggest there are several competing regions with the capacity to increase harvest volumes that an Oregonian forest manager must contend with including southern states, Canada and countries outside of the US with established plantations. Recent data on import trends confirm increased market activity from several countries with expanding forest resources. Latin America, as a region, has increased its exports of softwood lumber and plywood to western ports from less than $ 10 million in 1990 to over $ 100 million in 2002 for softwood lumber and from nearly no activity in 1997 to over $ 8 million in <b>softwood</b> <b>plywood</b> (mostly from Chile). While Brazil’s share appears to have peaked in 1999 at less than $ 25 million (mostly lumber), other countries have increased exports to western ports including Chile (both lumber and plywood), Uruguay (lumber) and Argentina (plywood). Softwood lumber entering western ports from Australia and New Zealand has increased from negligible numbers in 1990 to nearly $ 150 million in 2002. Imports of <b>softwood</b> <b>plywood</b> from New Zealand topped $ 1 million in 2002. These trade flows are small but significant since they signal new market suppliers to the US through western ports that directly compete with Oregonian products. Within the southern states, annual harvest levels are projected to increase over the next twenty years in those states outlying the traditional timber-producing central states of Georgia and Alabama. Fringe regions in eastern Texas and the Carolinas are expected to increase annual harvest volumes by 15 % or more in some areas more than offsetting declines in Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi. We examine several environmental measures for those regions expected to increase market share due to constant annual harvest levels in Oregon. In general, since regions that compensate for Oregon’s lower harvest volume have shorter rotations and lower volumes per acre at harvest time, there will be more acres disturbed by harvest activities than would have been if the harvest activity were to occur in Oregon. Conservation concerns in the South are growing as they continue to augment their share of the US market. They include a decline in ecosystem communities that are endangered and not under public management. Also, with much wood growing in emerging plantation regions around the world, and their rankings in biodiversity and other indices low, there is concern that the shift to Asian and Latin American producers may lead to lower conservation efforts abroad. Carbon dioxide and other green house gas emissions also increase with greater use of alternative materials like steel and concrete. Estimates place the additional emissions as high as 1. 4 million metric tons annually by 2040. A loss in future market share also has implications for investment strategies in Oregon, with its social and economic consequences. One conclusion of the analysis suggests that the South, with continued growing demand for wood fiber, will increase its management intensity of forests augmenting productivity. Without the larger market for Oregon producers such management investments become more questionable in Oregon with a concomitant effect on its own forest productivity. While prices for timber may go up, the revenues that landowners receive maybe reduced since they are not able to harvest the same volumes as before. In addition, the lower harvest level removes any incentive for new capacity expansion in Oregon, amounting to 7 to 8 average-sized mills. There are also extensive areas of plantations internationally. These areas are likely to come into play in the near future representing low-cost sources of wood and attracting investments to produce wood products for a globalized market. These results suggest that planners need to evaluate the tradeoffs associated with an unexpected change in harvest levels for Oregon. Since there is a need to meet growing demand and Oregon can increase its annual harvest level to meet a part of the growth in demand, any program that limits its potential to supply wood products will allow other regions and countries to expand their harvest levels, with an associated environmental tradeoff and shift in social and economic benefits. The question becomes whether the tradeoffs are favorable for Oregon and the global community or not. These tradeoffs need to be considered in order to reach environmental, social and economic goals, which may extend outside of Oregon’s boundaries. This study, combined with others that detail Oregon’s environmental management, should prove useful in answering that question...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the early}} 1980 s, the US {{has worked to}} persuade Japan to open its wood {{products}} market to US products through various channels including bilateral talks, multilateral negotiations, and regional alliances. In response, Japan has reluctantly liberalized and deregulated its wood products imports through tariff reductions, building standards revisions, and foreign product standards recognition over the last fifteen years. Although the US-Japan trade dispute has been a widely discussed topic in general, the dispute over trade liberalization and market deregulation of the wood products sector has been often neglected or seldom mentioned. At a time when discussions of new multilateral trade talks are beginning within the WTO, and Japan is reevaluating its stance toward liberalized wood products imports by initiating a preliminary investigation to the possible implementation of a safeguard action against softwood lumber imports, it will be useful {{to look back and}} understand the process through which the US-Japan wood products trade dispute has progressed, the outcomes it has achieved, and the lessons that can be drawn from this experience. The objectives of this study are 1) to describe the historical development of the US-Japan wood products trade dispute, 2) to summarize the trade liberalization and market deregulation measures taken in Japan {{as a result of these}} trade negotiations, 3) to analyze the performance of US products in Japan’s mix of wood products imports, and 4) to conduct a preliminary evaluation of US trade liberalization and market deregulation initiatives on Japan’s wood products market. HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE US-JAPAN WOOD PRODUCTS TRADE DISPUTE The US-Japan wood products trade dispute began in the early 1980 s under the conditions of a growing US trade deficit with Japan, the economic recession in the US, and the relative decline of the wood products industry in the western US. In 1985, Japan’s wood products sector was chosen as a target for the MOSS talks, mainly due to Japan’s strong opposition to the reduction of tariffs on veneer and plywood. Both countries reached an agreement to reduce specific wood product tariffs and to modify product standards so as to meet the requests of the US. In spite of the trade policy changes achieved in 1985, US legislators remained dissatisfied with the growing trade deficit with Japan and legislated the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, including the Super 301 provision. Due to US industry frustration with Japan’s reluctance toward continuing the MOSS process, Japan’s wood products sector was identified as a “priority practice” under the Super 301 provision in 1989. Under the threat of retaliation, both countries concluded the “ 1990 Agreement on Wood Products. ” Although the Agreement did not deal with tariff issues directly, it required an overhaul of Japan’s building standards and products standards. After the completion of Super 301 negotiations, the US wood products industry turned to a new trade issue: the zero-for-zero initiative in the GATT Uruguay Round, by forming the Zero Tariff Coalition in cooperation with other industrial sectors. Although several industrial sectors achieved mutual tariff elimination during the Uruguay Round, the wood products sector failed to achieve tariff elimination primarily due to Japan’s opposition. Following the end of the GATT negotiations in December 1993, the US continued its pressure on Japan to eliminate tariffs on wood products. Due to Japan’s resistance, coupled with the failure of the Framework talks in February 1994, the US revived the Super 301 provision to name Japan’s wood products sector in the watch list, forcing Japan to compromise. With Japan’s promise to fully implement the 1990 Agreement and new initiatives in Japan’s housing sector that was partly stimulated by the Kobe Earthquake disaster, the US industry finally allowed the removal of Japan from the Super 301 watch list in 1996. Although the tariff elimination issue was also discussed during the bilateral negotiations following the Super 301 revival, it was eventually transferred to the regional discussions held within APEC. While the elimination of wood products tariffs was successfully included in the EVSL initiative, Japan refused to participate in the wood products tariff measure citing the APEC principle of voluntarism. Finally, APEC members agreed to move the renamed ATL initiative to the WTO, hoping to reach agreement during the Third WTO Ministerial Meeting in Seattle. However, no progress was made on the ATL initiative, or on the initiation of the WTO New Round. RESULTS OF TRADE LIBERALIZATION AND MARKET DEREGULATION The US industry succeeded in the trade liberalization and market deregulation initiatives in Japan’s wood products sector. As the result of fifteen years of negotiations, Japan reduced tariffs on wood products, changed its building standards from prescriptive to performance-based, and recognized wood products graded in the US for construction use in Japan. First, regarding tariffs, the MOSS agreement reduced tariffs on specific products including veneer and plywood, and the Uruguay Round Agreement reduced tariffs on most wood products by approximately 30 % from the applied level in 1993. The final bound rates were implemented in 1999 following a five-year staging period. However, due to shifts in Japan’s wood products imports from logs to processed products, the trade-weighted average of wood products tariffs increased slightly during the 1985 - 1999 period. Second, in 1999, Japan revised its Building Standard Law from a prescriptive to a performance-based system, as promised in the 1990 Agreement on Wood Products and the 1996 Emergency Priority Program. Additionally, Japan immediately implemented specific building standard measures listed in the ANNEX of the 1990 Agreement. It is expected that the revised BSL will increase the number of 2 x 4 wood frame housing starts and promote the use of imported value-added wood products for post and beam homes. Third, Japan introduced new systems, which recognized imported wood products for construction use in Japan. Regarding JAS, MAFF implemented the FTO system, which permitted the use of test data conducted by recognized foreign testing organizations for the mill certification and product testing process as a result of the MOSS agreement. Later, in 1999, MAFF revised the JAS Law to incorporate the RCO/RFCO system which authorized specific (foreign) certification organizations to certify (foreign) manufacturers to test their own products and self-label them as JAS approved. At the same time, MOC reached a mutual recognition agreement with the US industry which recognized the use of dimension lumber, MSR lumber, and finger-jointed lumber bearing the grademark of US testing agencies for 2 x 4 wood frame construction in Japan. These measures will surely provide easier access for foreign products, not limited to just US products, in Japan’s wood products market. EFFECTS OF TRADE LIBERALIZATION AND MARKET DEREGULATION In spite of its success in the trade liberalization and market deregulation initiatives, the US wood products industry has been losing market share in Japan’s imports of softwood lumber, <b>softwood</b> <b>plywood,</b> softwood veneer, structural laminated lumber, wood doors, and wood windows. In some cases, the US increased its exports to Japan, but exports from other countries, mostly Canada and EU, increased more rapidly than those from the US, resulting in a lower market share for the US. This trend indicates that as the US industry was negotiating trade liberalization and market deregulation initiatives in Japan, structural changes were occurring that would adversely impact the competitiveness of the US wood products industry. These structural and market changes include changing material preferences in Japan toward kiln-dried products, the strength of the US dollar relative to Canadian and European currencies, and higher transportation costs from the US to Japan than from the EU. In addition, it should be noted that some studies indicated that other successful countries made substantial efforts to develop a better understanding of Japanese market conditions and accommodate Japanese customers’ extra requirement for products and services. PRELIMINARY EVALUATION The declining share of US products in Japan’s wood products imports can be attributed to two factors: an increase in US domestic consumption of wood products, and the reduced international competitiveness of US wood products. First, wood products exports have become less important to the US industry with the increasing consumption of wood products under the strong economic growth of the 1990 s. Second, the US industry has been slow to develop its advantage relative to its competitors in Japan, where some market conditions, including a shift in material preferences toward kiln-dried products, less favorable changing exchange rates, and highertransportation costs, have adversely impacted the competitiveness of US wood products. If the US industry wants to increase its wood products exports, it would be advisable for the industry to develop its advantages relative to its competitors in addition to improving market access. Important factors for success include developing a better understanding of the market, making stronger efforts to match product offerings with changing customer preferences, accommodating customers’ extra requirements for products and services, improving product quality, and offering competitive prices. Additionally, the US industry may wish to reconsider their export strategies in response to increasing domestic consumption and constrained resource availability and the impact of these factors on their ability to commit to long-term relationships with their foreign customers. At this time, it is too early to reach a final conclusion regarding the competitiveness of the US wood products industry. Given Japan’s changing market conditions, new opportunities could emerge for the US wood products industry to further penetrate Japan’s import market. In that case, future success is dependent upon the US industry’s efforts to develop its advantages relative to their competitors...|$|E
