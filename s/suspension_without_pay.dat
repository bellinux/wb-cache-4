500|$|On May 16, 2006 the University {{released}} their findings; the Investigative Committee agreed unanimously that Churchill {{had engaged}} in [...] "serious research misconduct", including falsification, fabrication, {{and two of the}} three allegations of plagiarism. The committee was divided on the appropriate level of sanctions. [...] The Standing Committee on Research Misconduct accepted the findings of the Investigative Committee but also disagreed on what sanctions should be imposed. Churchill's appeal against his proposed dismissal was considered by a panel of the University's Privilege and Tenure Committee, which found that two of the seven findings of misconduct did not constitute dismissible offences. [...] Three members recommended that the penalty should be demotion and one year's <b>suspension</b> <b>without</b> <b>pay,</b> while two favored dismissal.|$|E

2500|$|On appeal, Burlington Northern {{argued that}} White had not {{suffered}} [...] "adverse employment action," [...] and therefore {{could not bring}} the suit, because {{she had not been}} fired, demoted, denied a promotion, or denied wages. In November 2002, a panel of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals initially agreed, where Judge James S. Gwin was joined by Judge Robert B. Krupansky, over the dissent of Judge Eric L. Clay. [...] The case was reheard en banc, however, and, in April 2004, the full court found for White, holding that the <b>suspension</b> <b>without</b> <b>pay</b> - even if back pay was eventually awarded - was an [...] "adverse employment action," [...] as was the change of responsibilities within the same job category.

50|$|Before the Mitchell Report came out, MLB had one unannounced {{mandatory}} test {{each year}} for every player and random tests for selective players during the season and the off-season. Each drug test examined each player for steroids, steroid precursors, and designer steroids. If caught, <b>suspensions</b> <b>without</b> <b>pay</b> occurred. The first positive tests resulted in a suspension for ten days, the second for thirty days, the third for sixty days and the fourth positive test resulted in a one-year suspension.|$|R

50|$|After George Mitchell’s {{report came}} out, MLB {{markedly}} increased testing and punishments. Now baseball tests unannounced {{twice a year}} for all players and random testing still occurs for selective players. MLB also tests for more substances. As of 2015, the MLB's Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program tests for eight different abusive drugs, 74 performance-enhancing drugs, and 56 stimulants. One of the 74 performance-enhancing drugs is Human Growth Hormone (HGH), a substance that was never tested for before the Mitchell Report because no reliable test existed. Along {{with the increase of}} substances tested for came an increase in <b>suspensions</b> <b>without</b> <b>pay.</b> The first positive test now results in an eighty-game suspension, the second is 162 games (a full season), and the third positive results in a lifetime suspension from the MLB.|$|R

40|$|Many {{complain}} about {{a lack of}} sanctions against prosecutors who violate disclosure obligations. Such violations frequently go undetected {{for a variety of}} reasons, such as the prevalence of guilty pleas and the difficulty inherent in learning what a prosecutor did not reveal. Even when detected, such violations often go unpunished by judges or bar disciplinary authorities. To fill this sanction gap, some have called for prosecutor offices to investigate and impose sanctions internally for disclosure violations. The Department of Justice’s (DOJ’s) investigation of the prosecutors who handled the trial of US Senator Ted Stevens provides a rare opportunity to observe the operation of such an internal disciplinary process. The investigation generated disagreements about the level of culpability of various members of the prosecution team and about who should be sanctioned. The most recent development in this internal sanctions saga occurred on April 5, 2013, when Administrative Judge Benjamin Gutman reversed 40 - and 15 -day <b>suspensions</b> <b>without</b> <b>pay</b> for the only two Stevens trial prosecutors against whom the DOJ’s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) had sought sanctions...|$|R

5000|$|In June 2003, two LVMPD {{corrections}} officers, Alan Hirjak, and Christopher Brinkley threw lit firecrackers into inmate {{areas at}} the Clark County Detention Center, which prompted a federal lawsuit by four former CCDC inmates against the two officers, and their supervisor, Sergeant P.J. Leeke. The lawsuit was dismissed in 2006 by U.S. District Judge James Mahan, but was re-instated by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in 2008, {{and at that}} time, Sergeant Leeke {{was removed from the}} lawsuit. The settlement case called for LVMPD to pay $8,000 to the former inmates, and the two corrections officers will pay $7,500 each out of their own pocket. An internal affairs investigation resulted in Hirjak serving a 160-hour <b>suspension</b> <b>without</b> <b>pay,</b> and Brinkley a 120-hour <b>suspension</b> <b>without</b> <b>pay.</b> Then-Sheriff Bill Young described the incident as a [...] "practical joke gone awry."

50|$|Players who test {{positive}} for either their {{first or second}} tests are given the option to appeal, in which scientific tests will be conducted to prove validity of test.

50|$|Since steroid testing {{began in}} 1987, the NFL has made strides to {{discourage}} steroid use through their testing policies and procedures. According to nflcommunications.com, The NFL collects more than 14,000 tests each year {{which is more}} than any other professional sport league. But there are also 53 players in each team, so this does not necessarily mean, there are more tests per player, compared to other leagues.

The NFL has committed to testing for a wide array of Performance Enhancing drugs, Starting in 2011 the NFL implemented random blood test {{for the use of the}} human growth hormone (HGH).

Bounties were placed on four specific players: quarterbacks Brett Favre, Cam Newton, Aaron Rodgers, and Kurt Warner. The NFL hit the Saints hard with punishments. Williams, who became defensive coordinator with the St. Louis Rams, was suspended indefinitely. Head coach Sean Payton was suspended for the entire 2012 season. Although he did not participate in the bounty program, he never told anyone to stop it. General Manager Mickey Loomis was suspended for the first eight regular season games, as he ignored an order from owner Tom Benson to ensure that the program was stopped. Assistant head coach Joe Vitt (who was named interim head coach during Payton's suspension) was banned for the first six regular season games. The Saints were also fined $500,000 and stripped of their 2nd-round picks in the 2012 and 2013 NFL drafts. Payton began his suspension April 15 after his appeal was rejected. Loomis and Vitt also appealed their suspensions, but they were upheld. [...] The NFL later announced punishments to four current and former Saints players. Linebacker Jonathan Vilma was suspended for the entire 2012 season; he twice offered $10,000 to anyone who knocked out Warner and Favre in the 2009 playoffs.
