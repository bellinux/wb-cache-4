50|$|Sir Walter Merriman {{established}} 'Merryville' {{one of the}} country's {{most famous}} <b>sheep</b> <b>studs</b> and arguably its leading fine-wool establishment in 1903. Yass is a prominent area for raising sheep which produce very fine wool due to the soil and climatic conditions of the Yass area.|$|R
50|$|In 1934 {{both the}} cattle and the <b>sheep</b> <b>studs</b> were sold at public auction, leaving about 750 acres on the {{homestead}} block around East Talgai house. George Carr Clark resided {{there with his}} wife and various family members until his death in 1942 when the entire property was sold.|$|R

In addition they operated a small Romney Marsh <b>sheep</b> <b>stud.</b> At 7700 acre in size Cuppacumbalong {{was one of}} the largest remaining freehold rural properties in the late 1960s.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, the school's {{respected}} agricultural credentials drew {{students from}} neighbouring communities. [...] The school provided many entries into Royal Adelaide Show livestock and horticulture competitions, especially the sheep and beef cattle categories. In the early 1980s the school became a poll dorset <b>sheep</b> <b>stud</b> called 'SASdor' for several years.|$|E

50|$|It {{is a small}} {{community}} within an agricultural area, rather than a town. The town lies {{in an area of}} limestone; erosion of this has led to the surrounding land being riddled with caves. To the west are two undeveloped cave complexes, Wet Caves and Honeycomb Caves, which are an attraction to cavers. The ground is pitted with sinkholes, a danger to the cattle that graze the fields. The district is probably named after the caves, though until 1897 it was known as Brookside. Prior to settlement what is now developed agricultural land was dense forest. The timber and dairy industries are prominent parts of Caveside's rural history and it was known in the early 20th century for the quality of its cattle and <b>sheep</b> <b>studs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pirra Homestead, in Forest Road, Lara, Victoria, {{was built}} in the mid-1860s by George Fairbairn (senior), one of Australia’s most prosperous pastoralists and a pioneer of Australia’s frozen meat export trade, who {{established}} the property as a premier <b>sheep</b> <b>stud.</b> The homestead was originally called 'Woodlands', but by 1880 the name of the property had changed to 'Windermere'.|$|E

50|$|Eton Vale Station was {{selected}} in 1840 by Arthur Hodgson who {{had followed the}} Leslie Brothers onto the Darling Downs. It was the second run selected in Queensland. At the time it covered an area of 268 km2. Originally a grazing property, wheat was grown from 1846 {{and it became a}} <b>sheep</b> <b>stud</b> in 1850. The slab house, erected soon after 1840 formed the core of a larger brick residence which continued to be added to up to as late as 1880.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the death}} of Macquoid's son Thomas Hyacinth Macquoid in 1857, Andrew Cunningham of Lanyon {{purchased}} the property. Cunningham, a banker from Fyfeshire in Scotland, had arrived in Sydney {{with his family in}} 1845. Tuggeranong became the centre of Cunningham's <b>sheep</b> <b>stud</b> activities and the flocks from all of Cunningham's properties were shorn in the sheds at Tuggeranong. After Cunningham's death in 1887, his sons James and Andrew Jackson Cunningham operated Tuggerangong and Lanyon in partnership, with James at Tuggeranong and Andrew at Lanyon.|$|E
50|$|He {{turned his}} {{attention}} to sheepfarming, at Corryton Park, successfully breeding <b>stud</b> <b>sheep,</b> while his wool clips had a good reputation both in South Australia and in London.|$|R
5000|$|They {{lived the}} happy {{untrammelled}} free {{life of the}} Australian Squire for such in effect is the status and surroundings of the pastoral proprietor of flocks and herds colloquially termed a Squatter..

This scenic town is situated about 70 km from East London on the N6 highway to the north. It is the home of many picturesque hiking trails, as well as mountain streams that are well-stocked with trout. A number of cattle and <b>sheep</b> <b>stud</b> farms are also to be found in Stutterheim. Wool, beef, dairy and citrus fruit are other central products which the area yields.|$|E

5000|$|Stein participated {{prominently}} in community {{life in the}} Mid North, including as a promoter and judge of horseracing events, magistrate, and (until his resignation in 1853) as Justice of the Peace. Not wishing to seem partisan, he participated in multiple fraternal lodges including Oddfellows and Freemasonry. He was fondly remembered as 'the life and soul' of any celebration. During that period, despite apparent wealth and influence, he carried increasing debts and mortgaged his wide-ranging estate. His declaration of insolvency in September 1848 was an irreparable step. His Kadlunga Station later became a merino <b>sheep</b> <b>stud</b> and Percheron horse stud, being successively owned by John Chewings (1816-79), Sir Samuel Way (1836-1916), and then Sir John Melrose (1860-1938).|$|E

50|$|In 1839 Osmond Gilles {{was part}} of a {{syndicate}} of nine investors that established the Hutt River Special Survey in the Clare Valley.

Among these was Kadlunga (also spelt Cadlunga, Tadlunga and Katalunga in earliest times), held under an occupation licence by James Stein. Kadlunga, beside Mount Horrocks and near Mintaro, was in later decades a premium <b>sheep</b> <b>stud</b> owned by Sir Samuel Way. During Oakden's time in the Clare Valley Mount Oakden (altitude 568 m) at nearby Penwortham was named for him. He was a close associate of neighbouring pastoralist John Ainsworth Horrocks, whose brother Arthur Horrocks resided with Oakden at Kadlunga from 1846 until his marriage in 1850, at which Oakden was groomsman. In 1846 Oakden had leased Kadlunga from Stein, who in 1848 became insolvent. Oakden then managed it until 1850.|$|E
