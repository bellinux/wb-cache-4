40|$|Selecting {{seeds for}} {{long-term}} storage {{is a key}} factor for food hoarding animals. <b>Siberian</b> <b>chipmunks</b> (Tamias sibiricus) remove the pericarp and scatter hoard sound acorns of Quercus mongolica over those that are insect-infested to maximize returns from caches. We {{have no knowledge of}} whether these chipmunks remove the pericarp from acorns of other species of oaks and if this behavior benefits seedling establishment. In this study, we tested whether <b>Siberian</b> <b>chipmunks</b> engage in this behavior with acorns of three other Chinese oak species, Q. variabilis, Q. aliena and Q. serrata var. brevipetiolata, and how the dispersal and germination of these acorns are affected. Our results show that when chipmunks were provided with sound and infested acorns of Quercus variabilis, Q. aliena and Q. serrata var. brevipetiolata, the two types were equally harvested and dispersed. This preference suggests that <b>Siberian</b> <b>chipmunks</b> are incapable of distinguishing between sound and insect-infested acorns. However, <b>Siberian</b> <b>chipmunks</b> removed the pericarp from acorns of these three oak species prior to dispersing and caching them. Consequently, significantly more sound acorns were scatter hoarded and more infested acorns were immediately consumed. Additionally, indoor germination experiments showed that pericarp removal by chipmunks promoted acorn germination while artificial removal showed no significant effect. Our results show that pericarp removal allows <b>Siberian</b> <b>chipmunks</b> to effectively discriminate against insect-infested acorns and may represent an adaptive behavior for cache management.

5000|$|The {{increasing}} rate {{of urbanization}} provides humans with greater mobility, and this advancement provides easier opportunities for humans to introduce non-native species, many of which cause health or economic issues. For instance, <b>Siberian</b> <b>chipmunks</b> tend to eat crops and damage urban gardens. [...] In Russia, they eat approximately 50 percent of the forest nuts, and in other locations they can produce economic setbacks in regards to grains and orchards because of large consumption of these products. [...] These chipmunks are also known for preying upon low-nesting birds, and <b>Siberian</b> <b>chipmunks</b> often compete with other small native animals, such as the red squirrel, wood mouse, and bank vole.

40|$|To {{understand}} {{the prevalence of}} Cryptosporidium infection in rodents in China and to assess the potential role of rodents {{as a source for}} human cryptosporidiosis, 723 specimens from 18 rodent species were collected from four provinces of China and examined between August 2007 and December 2008 by microscopy after using Sheather's sugar flotation and modified acid-fast staining. Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected in 83 specimens, with an overall prevalence of 11. 5 %. Phodopus sungorus, Phodopus campbelli, and Rattus tanezumi were new reported hosts of Cryptosporidium. The genotypes and subtypes of Cryptosporidium strains in microscopy-positive specimens were further identified by PCR and sequence analysis of the small subunit rRNA and the 60 -kDa glycoprotein (gp 60) genes. In addition to Cryptosporidium parvum, C. muris, C. andersoni, C. wrairi, ferret genotype, and mouse genotype I, four new Cryptosporidium genotypes were identified, including the hamster genotype, chipmunk genotype III, and rat genotypes II and III. Mixed Cryptosporidium species/genotypes were found in 10. 8 % of Cryptosporidium-positive specimens. Sequence analysis of the gp 60 gene showed that C. parvum strains in pet <b>Siberian</b> <b>chipmunks</b> and hamsters were all of the subtype IIdA 15 G 1, which was found previously in a human isolate in The Netherlands and lambs in Spain.

5000|$|Although {{these animals}} can exhibit slight {{variations}} in coloration in different geographic regions, they possess several common characteristics. [...] Typically the <b>Siberian</b> <b>chipmunk</b> has 4 white stripes and 5 dark stripes along the back. [...] It is 18-25 cm long, {{a third of}} which is the tail. [...] The weight of adults depends on the time of year and food availability. [...] Even though the <b>Siberian</b> <b>chipmunk</b> normally grows to 50-150 grams, this species is relatively small compared to other Sciuridae, such as the Red Squirrel. [...] The Siberian chipmunks are not known to exhibit sexual dimorphism, and size and body proportions are the only way to distinguish younger chipmunks from older ones. Their small size may contribute to their relatively short lives, which tend to range from 2 to 5 years in the wild.

50|$|A perhaps {{surprisingly}} high {{balance of}} mammalian foods consists of rodents or similar smallish mammals, as {{about half of}} the species consumed by brown bears weigh less than 10 kg on average. These may include hares (Lepus ssp.), pikas (Ochotona ssp.) marmots (Marmota ssp.), ground squirrels, chipmunks, mice, rats, lemmings and voles. Due to their propensity for digging, brown bears are able to smell out active subterranean burrows of these small mammals and either wait quietly or furiously dig away until the animals are either displaced and lunged at or are cornered in their burrows. Not only do they consume the small mammals, but they also feed on their caches, as has been recorded in grizzly bears attacking voles and northern pocket gophers (Thomomys talpoides). In some areas, caches may be the primary target when bears dig at these animal's burrows, as may be the case with <b>Siberian</b> <b>chipmunks</b> (Eutamias sibiricus), whose hoards can contain up to 20 kg of food, with the chipmunks themselves only being caught occasionally. With particular regularity, tundra-dwelling grizzlies will wait at burrows of Arctic ground squirrels (Spermophilus parryii) hoping to pick off a few of the 1 kg rodents. Ground squirrel hunting is most successful in September and October, when early snow may impede the rodents‚Äô rocky escape routes. In Denali National Park, Arctic ground squirrels represent about 8% of the year-round diet of grizzly bears and are the most consistent source of animal protein for grizzlies there. An even more important dietary relationship with a small mammal occurs in the Tibetan blue bear, which is apparently the most completely carnivorous brown bear race, foraging most regularly for plateau pikas (Ochotona curzoniae), a species about one-sixth the weight of an Arctic ground squirrel. As many as 25 pikas have been found in a single bear's stomach and in Changtang, 60% of the diet consisted of pikas. Where plateau pikas are absent, as in the Mustang region of Nepal, Himalayan marmots (Marmota himalayana) become the dietary staple of the bear, occurring in about half of nearly a thousand scats. Large rodents such as beavers (Castor spp.) and North American porcupines (Erethizon dorsatum) are rare prey items, mostly due to differing habitat preferences, as well as the obvious defenses of the latter. Up to five species of cetacean have been recorded as a food source in the coastal regions of Alaska, the Central Arctic and (formerly) California when beached.|$|R

5000|$|Lyme disease, {{also known}} as Borrelia burgdorferi, is a vector-borne disease that can be {{transmitted}} through ticks. In comparison to bank voles and wood mice, the Siberian chipmunks contribute a much larger risk {{when it comes to}} Lyme disease. The chipmunk's ability to spread this disease poses a risk to humans because Lyme disease can cause neurological, joint, and skin problems. The Invasive Species Compendium states that the <b>Siberian</b> <b>chipmunk</b> can easily survive and spread diseases, like Lyme disease, to humans because the species has high genetic variability and high reproductive potential. [...] Also, with the Siberian chipmunk's movement and introduction into new environments, ticks and other parasites possess a greater opportunity to attach to hosts. Lastly species invasion is difficult and costly to control, so these animals will continue to pose a threat to humans and other animals until they eventually became extinct or until humans actively take measures to reduce their impact on society.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In Italy {{there are}} four species of {{squirrel}}s: the native red squirrel and other three species recently introduced. The red squirrel {{is present in the}} Italian peninsula with three subspecies, and is missing only in Salento, and Italian islands. This species is common on Alps and Apennines, while in the plains it is declining because of the habitat loss. Competition with the grey squirrel and habitat fragmentation are considered the major threats to the survival of the red squirrel. The grey squirrel is present in Piedmont and Liguria. A study on the Piedmontese colony showed that the red squirrel is disappearing from the area colonised by the grey squirrel and the damage due to bark-stripping and feeding is considerable. Free-ranging populations of the <b>Siberian</b> <b>chipmunk</b> live in Belluno, Verona, and Rome, but records of single animals were reported for other areas. The Finlayson's squirrel is present with a small nucleus in an urban area of Piedmont. Here, the impact of this species on the vegetation appears dramatic.

40|$|While sexual {{selection}} in mammals with female defense systems has historically received considerable attention, much less {{is known about}} the factors affecting reproductive success in mammalian species with scramble competition mating systems. Using mark‚Äìrecapture techniques and DNA microsatellite loci to assign parentage, we examined the mating system and factors affecting the variation of the annual reproductive success in an introduced population of the <b>Siberian</b> <b>chipmunk,</b> Tamias sibiricus, a small, monomorphic, solitary squirrel. Our analyses showed that breeding females were spatially dispersed, setting the stage for a scramble competition mating system. Male reproductive success was positively associated with the size of the home range. The strength of {{sexual selection}} on this behavioral trait was very strong, equaling previous estimates for morphological traits in female defense mating systems. These findings suggest that a behavioral trait, space use, strongly influences the annual reproductive success in males, which is consistent with expectations in a scramble competition mating system. In both sexes, reproductive success was influenced by habitat, with twice as many juveniles produced in semi-open than in closed habitat, possibly due to differences in food availability between the two habitats...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{spread of}} an {{immigrant}} host species can be influenced both by its specific helminth parasites that {{come along with}} it and by newly acquired infections from native fauna. The <b>Siberian</b> <b>chipmunk,</b> Tamias sibiricus Laxmann (Rodentia, Sciuridae), a northeastern Eurasiatic ground nesting Sciurid, has been introduced in France for less than three decades. Thirty individuals were collected from three suburban forests in the Ile-de-France Region between 2002 and 2006. Two intestinal nematode species dominated the helminth fauna: Brevistriata skrjabini [Prevalence, P, 99 % C. I., 87 % (64 ‚Äì 97 %); mean intensity, M. I., 99 % C. I., 43 (28 ‚Äì 78) ] and Aonchotheca annulosa [P, 47 % (25 ‚Äì 69 %); M. I., 35 (3 ‚Äì 157) ]. B. skrjabini is a direct life cycle nematode species of North Eurasiatic origin, with a restricted spectrum of phylogenetically related suitable hosts.

However, such variation in mortality is difficult to relate to functional life history components (e. g. reproduction, dispersal, hibernation) due to the difficulty in monitoring biological processes at a sufficiently fine timescale. In this study, we used a 10 -year individual-based data set with an infra-annual timescale to investigate both intra- and inter-annual survival patterns according to intrinsic and environmental covariates in an introduced population of a small hibernating rodent, the <b>Siberian</b> <b>chipmunk.</b> We compared three distinct periods related to particular life history events: spring reproduction, summer reproduction and hibernation. Our results revealed strong interactions between intrinsic and temporal effects. First, survival of male chipmunks strongly decreases during the reproduction periods, while survival is high and equal between sexes during hibernation. Second, the season of birth affects the survival of juveniles during their first hibernation, which does not have long-lasting consequences at the adult stage. Third, at an inter-annual scale, we found that high food resource availability before hibernation and low chipmunk densities specifically favour subsequent winter survival.
