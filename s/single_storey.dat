5|$|A {{significant}} extension {{was designed}} in 1889 by John Whitelaw. The south-west wing, 'behind' the original house, used the different architectural {{style of a}} Victorian villa for the two-storey addition. The NZHPT assumes {{that at the same}} time, a <b>single</b> <b>storey</b> extension was built onto the south-east side.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{the concept}} of {{liberating}} the spirits of the soldiers and civilians who were sacrificed during the Japanese invasion in World War II, the temple of Poh Ern Shih was constructed {{on the site of the}} bloodshed on Chwee Chian Hill. It was established in 1954 as a modest <b>single</b> <b>storey</b> temple by philanthropist Lee Choon Seng (1888—1966), as one of the few Chinese Mahayana temples in Singapore dedicated to the Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva.|$|E
5|$|Four two storey residences, Numbers 8, 10, 16 and 18 The Terrace, {{were built}} during the 1850s for officer accommodation. Number 8, {{also known as}} the Chaplain's House, is a two storey house with {{rendered}} and painted limestone walls. The plan is roughly square with verandahs and balconies along the west and south sides. A <b>single</b> <b>storey</b> building connects the south-east side of the house to the main prison wall.|$|E

5|$|At {{the south}} eastern {{corner of the}} eastern terrace is the former pumping station, {{associated}} tunnels {{and a set of}} 1850s workshops within an enclosing wall. Underneath parts of the eastern terrace, the adjacent Hampton Road, the pumping station and the workshops there are a complex series of shafts, drives and weirs cut from the rock during the 1890s and early twentieth century. The east workshops is a <b>single</b> <b>storey</b> limestone building on the western side with an enclosed area to the east. The entire workshops yard was roofed using a light steel truss on steel supports in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Quamby {{house was}} built for Sir Richard Dry in 1838, {{probably}} to a design by Richard Cromwell Carpenter. It was built mostly by convict labour, using locally made clay bricks, in an American Colonial style, a <b>single</b> <b>storey</b> with a stone-flagged long veranda. The original estate was broken up {{in the second half}} of the 19th century. Quamby was opened for tourism, by Tasmanian Premier David Bartlett on 4 October 2009. It is operated as the Quamby Golf and Country Club, and has a par 38 9-hole golf course that dates from the early 1990s.|$|E

50|$|Originally a <b>single</b> eight <b>storey</b> block {{containing}} 576 beds {{standing on}} a three storey podium, further buildings have since been added, with the most recent being a new cancer care centre to replace the current Beatson Oncology Centre facilities that are currently spread between Gartnavel, the Western Infirmary and the Royal Infirmary.|$|R
5|$|The {{entrance}} to the house is {{on the north side}} through a <b>single</b> <b>storey</b> portico. The north façade features tall sash windows on the ground and first floors of 12 panes; the second floor windows to the central section are shorter and of nine panes. moulded stucco cornices run above the ground and first floor windows. The east and west façades are five bays wide with a two-storey projecting bay on the east end and a single-storey projecting bay on the west end.|$|E
5|$|The principal, or South façade, is 344feet (104.9m) {{in length}} (from {{each of the}} {{flanking}} wings to the other), its austerity relieved on the piano nobile level only by a great six-columned portico. Each end of the central block is terminated by a slight projection, containing a Venetian window surmounted by a <b>single</b> <b>storey</b> square tower and capped roof, similar to those employed by Inigo Jones at Wilton House nearly a century earlier. A near identical portico was designed by Inigo Jones and Isaac de Caus for the Palladian front at Wilton, but this was never executed.|$|E
5|$|The <b>single</b> <b>storey</b> 1855 {{refractory}} block {{is on the}} same axis as the main cell block to its east. It consists of twelve punishment cells and six dark cells with no light. The gallows chamber, built in 1888, is between this and the main cell block and relates to the colonial use of the prison. The gallows operated via a rope tied around a beam, over a trap door, on the upper level. Opening the trap door would cause the condemned prisoner fall, and thus be hanged.|$|E

5|$|Number 16 is a {{house is}} two storey building, roughly square in plan, with painted {{limestone}} walls and a corrugated sheet metal roof behind a parapet. It accommodated first the superintendent, later on the resident magistrate, and remained in-use as housing for prison officers until the 1970s. Number 18, {{also known as the}} Surgeon's House, is a two storey structure with limestone walls. It is the southernmost house on The Terrace. Numbers 18 and 8, the northernmost of the initial buildings, both featured two sitting rooms, three bedrooms, and two dressing rooms, as well as a kitchen, water closet and shed, but with mirrored layouts. Number 18 was expanded with additions built in the 1890s. A <b>single</b> <b>storey</b> limestone structure (former stables) is located to the south of Number 18.|$|E
5|$|The hospital, built between 1857 and 1859, was {{a crucial}} {{component}} of Fremantle Prison. Public works during the convict era relied on convict labour, which could only be provided if the convicts were healthy. Located in the north-eastern corner of the prison compound, the building is H-shaped in plan, <b>single</b> <b>storey</b> with rendered and painted limestone walls. It features a wide verandah with timber posts. From 1886 to 1903, medical services were relocated to the main cell block, with the former building used to keep invalids and female prisoners. The hospital was refurbished, and reopened in 1904. It subsequently remained in continuous operation until the prison's closure in 1991.|$|E
5|$|The {{north-western}} complex {{was originally}} a service {{area with a}} cookhouse, bakehouse and laundry, built in the 1850s. A place for women prisoners was needed following the closure of Perth Gaol and the transfer of prisoners to Fremantle. The buildings were converted to a prison, and a wall built around them, creating Western Australia's first separate prison for women – a gaol within a gaol. Population and crime growth led to them being extended in the 1890s and 1910s. The <b>single</b> <b>storey</b> limestone building, {{also known as the}} female division, has a distinctive monitor roof and an upper storey addition to part of the eastern range in red brick. The construction of Bandyup Women's Prison saw Fremantle's Women's Prison close in 1970. The space was used for education and assessment until the main prison's closure in 1991, and has since been adapted for TAFE use as a visual arts facility.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} {{analytical}} studies is presented on the behaviour of an unprotected plane composite steel-concrete frame under fire scenarios which occur across <b>single</b> <b>storeys</b> of the structure. The main {{purpose is to}} assess the effectiveness of using various types of sub-assembly in predicting the structural behaviour in fire. The studies are based on modelling a full-scale experimental multi-storey frame in which some fire testing is to take place shortly, and in part originate from a programme of analyses in which the authors have participated whose aim has been to determine the test parameters required. For the basic modelling studies the frames and subframes {{are assumed to be}} rigidly connected, but the effect of the semi-rigidity of real connections is also investigated. The analyses are all performed using a program NARR 2, whose most recent development has been the capability to take into account strain reversal whenever it happens. This allows an assessment of the residual effects on the frame members after a local fire has been extinguished and the frame has returned to ambient temperature...|$|R
5|$|The {{park has}} two gate lodges; both are listed at grade II. The {{northern}} lodge at Slaughter Hill is by Blore and dates from 1847. In red brick with darker-brick diapering, stone dressings and a slate roof, {{it has a}} T-shaped plan with a <b>single</b> <b>storey,</b> and is Jacobean in style. It features two shaped gables, each decorated with a panel carved with Crewe Estate emblems, and a hexagonal central bay with a pyramidal roof which forms a porch. The Elizabethan-style Weston or Golden Gates Lodge {{to the south of}} the house dates from before 1865 and is attributed to William Eden Nesfield, although it is not typical of his style. In red brick with blue-brick zig–zag diapering, ashlar dressings and a slate roof, the lodge has two storeys, with a projecting canted bay to the road face. The driveway face has an ashlar panel with a shield bearing the Crewe family coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|The prison's {{workshops}} provided {{activities and}} training for the prisoners. They also reduced the cost of maintenance, repairs, and construction by providing an in-house service. The original workshop was a blacksmith's shop, {{one of the first}} buildings to be constructed on the prison site. Later known as the East Workshops, other workshops included carpenter's, plumber's and painter's, a printing office, and from the 1850s, a metal shop. The West Workshops were built {{at the start of the}} twentieth century, providing more work for prisoners through a paint shop, mat maker, shoe maker, book binder and tailor shop. The five western workshops are a <b>single</b> <b>storey</b> squared limestone rubble building with openings dressed in brick, with an open saw-tooth roof with southern skylights, concealed behind a parapet wall. In 1993 the western workshops were adapted for use as TAFE art workshops.|$|E
5|$|Sprotbrough Bridge is {{actually}} two bridges that carry Mill Lane, the southern one crossing the weir stream {{and the northern}} one crossing the lock cut. Replacing a ferry crossing of the river, the first bridge and associated toll house were built in 1849 for Sir Joseph William Copley of Sprotbrough Hall. The designers of the southern bridge were Benjamin Brundell and William Arnold, and the present structure has three segmental arches on each side, which originally formed the approaches to a central arch. The arch was replaced by an above-deck truss in 1897. The ironwork was manufactured by Newton Chambers & Co. Ltd., who were based at Thorncliffe Ironworks in Sheffield, as recorded by plates attached to the bridge. The northern bridge was a single-arched masonry structure, which {{has been replaced by}} a plate girder bridge resting on the original piers. The toll house, consisting of a <b>single</b> <b>storey</b> with a half basement, made of dressed sandstone with an asphalt roof, still survives on the northern bank of the lock cut. Tolls collected here for passage over Sprotbrough Bridge were said to have been given by the Copley family to the Doncaster Dispensary.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} seismic resistance of typical <b>single</b> and double <b>storey</b> masonry buildings constructed in the southern districts of Pakhthunkhwa, Pakistan. Two types of bricks; wooden and rice husk burnt bricks, have been investigated in combination with mud and cement-sand mortar. Plane and reinforced specimens have been tested in axial compression and diagonal compression. Analysis of the experimental results show that both <b>single</b> and double <b>storey</b> buildings constructed {{in the study area}} with mud mortar and mud plaster are seismically vulnerable. However application of the wire mesh on wall surface subsequently plastered increases the strength significantly and make the structure resistant to the earthquake forces...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the primary}} {{requirements}} of houses constructed in hot humid climatic conditions such as those prevailing in Sri Lanka is that those should be thermally comfortable for the occupants throughout the day and around the year. Most of the <b>single</b> and two <b>storey</b> houses constructed in Sri Lanka have failed to fulfill this requirement. Therefore, a critical review was undertaken to develop passive concepts that can be incorporated in the future houses. It is shown with a detailed study that three storey houses can perform much better than <b>single</b> and two <b>storey</b> houses not only with respect to thermal comfort, but also with respect to visual comfort, functionality, minimisation of Flash floods, creation of a desirable micro climate etc. It is also shown {{that the cost of}} three storey houses can be in the range of that of the <b>single</b> and two <b>storey</b> houses, when the traditional construction materials are used in an efficient manner. The use of these concepts for houses built in the future in Sri Lanka will be extremely important in order to minimise the electrical energy required for operation of houses; this will be quite useful since the electrical energy sources available for Sri Lanka are limited...|$|R
5|$|Dating from 857 of the Tang Dynasty, the Great East Hall (东大殿) is {{the third}} oldest dated wooden {{building}} in China after the main hall of the Nanchan Temple dated to 782, and the main hall of the Five Dragons Temple, dated to 831. The hall {{is located on the}} far east side of the temple, atop a large stone platform. It is a <b>single</b> <b>storey</b> structure measuring seven bays by four or 34 by 17.7 metres (110 by 58ft), and is supported by inner and outer sets of columns. On top of each column is a complicated set of brackets containing seven different bracket types that are one-third as high as the column itself. Supporting the roof of the hall, each of the bracket sets are connected by crescent shaped crossbeams, which create an inner ring above the inner set of columns and an outer ring above the outer columns. The hall has a lattice ceiling that conceals much of the roof frame from view. The hipped-roof and the extremely complex bracket sets are testament to the Great East Hall's importance as a structure during the Tang Dynasty. According to the 11th-century architectural treatise, Yingzao Fashi, the Great East Hall closely corresponds to a seventh rank building in a system of eight ranks. The high rank of the Great East Hall indicates that even in the Tang Dynasty it was an important building, and no other buildings from the period with such a high rank survive.|$|E
