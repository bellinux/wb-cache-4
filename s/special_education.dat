40|$|This is a {{research}} paper that will discuss relations between universal design (UD) <b>education</b> and <b>special</b> needs <b>education</b> in the Japanese context. First, the definitions and terminology of UD are explained. In addition, UD education, UD for learning (UDL) and UD for instructions (UDI) are explained. Second, how UD was introduced into Japanese education is discussed. Third, the relationship between UD <b>education</b> and <b>special</b> needs <b>education</b> is approached. Japanese teachers may apply UD as to practice <b>special</b> needs <b>education.</b> However, UD means“ universal” and UD practice usually targets all children, while <b>special</b> needs <b>education</b> focuses more deeply upon an individual child. To ensure an understanding of these relations, survey results of teachers’ perceptions of UD education was included. The survey revealed that teachers were confused and unsure what UD was, or what the difference between UD <b>education</b> and <b>special</b> needs <b>education</b> was. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} figure out the concept of UD education. Although UD <b>education</b> and <b>special</b> needs <b>education</b> are not equal, the notion of UD may have much potential to improve <b>special</b> needs <b>education.</b> For examples, UD might provide better practices for students with high functioning developmental disabilities and it may also cover a gap between regular <b>education</b> and <b>special</b> needs <b>education.</b> To conclude, UD education may be useful as first intervention and <b>special</b> needs <b>education</b> may take the role of being effective additional support. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{research}} {{article on the}} provision of <b>special</b> needs <b>education</b> in Zimbabwe. This paper is informed by the view that by accepting the principles enunciated in the Salamanca Statement and Framework for Action on <b>Special</b> Needs <b>Education,</b> Zimbabwe opted for inclusion as its guiding philosophy {{in the provision of}} <b>Special</b> Needs <b>Education.</b> In the light of this, the paper further presents the situation of <b>Special</b> Needs <b>Education</b> as it has historically developed in Zimbabwe, noting that it was, and largely informed by the philosophy of integration. The argument is then made that there is need for conceptual clarity if integration and inclusion are not to be confused in the provision of <b>Special</b> Needs <b>Education</b> so that the focus should be on inclusive education for which Zimbabwe has opted. In other words, it is noted that while inclusion is the preferred concept, it appears that integration predominates the practice in <b>Special</b> Needs <b>Education</b> in Zimbabwe. This predominance largely emanates from policy documents that have been produced over the years to give guidance to those involved in the provision of <b>Special</b> Needs <b>Education.</b> Even scholars who have written on <b>Special</b> Needs <b>Education</b> in Zimbabwe tend to betray a lack of conceptual clarity between these two concepts as they tend to use them interchangeably. Thus, primary sources in the form of policy documents from government ministries and secondary sources in the form of articles by scholars on <b>Special</b> Needs <b>Education</b> are discussed. It is maintained in this article that lack of conceptual clarity often results in lack of progress towards the attainment of the preferred philosophy...|$|R

5|$|An example {{may be a}} {{local school}} system in the United States. It {{receives}} {{a grant from the}} its local state government to support a new <b>special</b> <b>education</b> initiative, another grant from the federal government for a school lunch program, and an annuity to award teachers working on research projects. At periodic intervals, the school system needs to generate a report to the state about the <b>special</b> <b>education</b> program, a report to a federal agency about the school lunch program, and a report to another authority about the research program. Each of these programs has its own unique reporting requirements, so the school system needs a method to separately identify the related revenues and expenditures. This is done by establishing separate funds, each with its own chart of accounts.|$|E

40|$|<b>Special</b> Needs <b>Education</b> Program in Uganda {{has survived}} {{through a period}} of trends since its formal {{introduction}} to the districts in 1992. Examples are trends in National Policies like Universal Primary Education (UPE) Reform & Decentralization of Administration to the districts. Other trends are the phasing out of main donor support to <b>Special</b> Needs <b>Education</b> at the districts of Uganda and formalization of appointments for <b>Special</b> Needs <b>Education</b> staff at the districts of Uganda. In a recent National School Inspection Programme undertaken by the National Standards Agency (ESA), it featured in its Report that the management and implementation of <b>Special</b> Needs <b>Education</b> was ineffective at the districts of Uganda. Based on that, this study was developed with a focus to identify the negative factors influencing the management of <b>Special</b> Need <b>Education</b> at the districts of Uganda and describe how these factors are influencing it. There was need to develop an understanding of what challenges the Assessment & Resource Teachers were facing in the management of <b>Special</b> Needs <b>Education</b> and how those problems were influencing its management. There was need to establish whether the newly formalised (district) appointments for the Assessment & Resource Teachers had any influence on their role. There was also need to identify possible challenges which the district local administration might have faced in the management of <b>Special</b> Needs <b>Education.</b> The {{purpose of the study was}} to build foundation for relevant decision making and action towards developing better strategies for managing <b>Special</b> Needs <b>Education</b> at the districts of Uganda. To guide this process, a research question developed in the background of the National Inspection Report was, What factors are influencing the management of <b>Special</b> Needs <b>Education</b> at the districts of Uganda and how are they influencing it? The approach taken was a Qualitative Case Study Design. It was a Multiple Case Study of three Assessment & Resource Centres in three districts purposely sampled from 45 original districts of Uganda. This approach followed Qualitative Semi Structured Interviews for Assessment & Resource Teachers (as the main informants) and the District Inspectors of Schools (to provide additional information). Broadly, the findings have pointed out that the Management of <b>Special</b> Needs <b>Education</b> is facing problems. These problems are arising from an existing gap or loose link between and/or among respective Systems which are pertinent to its survival. These Systems are potentially in place but are simply uncoordinated. There is (for example) a felt distance between the Centre (Macrosystem level) and the Districts (Microsystem level). Similarly, in as far as <b>Special</b> Need <b>Education</b> is concerned, the systems within the districts are loosely linked up to effectively manage <b>Special</b> Needs <b>Education.</b> Even those at the Centre are feared to be equally bearing coordination gaps. This has created other gaps leading to secondary problems like a role shift among the Assessment & Resource Teachers, low motivation, among others discussed in the text. To this effect, the suggestion is change the approach to <b>Special</b> Needs <b>Education</b> in Uganda. Instead of focusing on problems and changing people, it is better to engage them in a collaborative discovery of what makes their system effective in financial, material and human resource terms...|$|R
