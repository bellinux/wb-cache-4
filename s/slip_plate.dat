The {{purpose of the}} shaking table is to evaluate the response of scaled model structures subjected to base excitation. Every component of the shaking table was carefully designed or sized to perform optimally at targeted levels. The performance curves for the shaking table which define the maximum load, velocity, and displacements that the table can attain were developed from the specifications of the hydraulic system. Interaction between the shaking table system and the foundation mass was analyzed. The dynamic characteristics of the <b>slip</b> <b>plate</b> and its interaction with model structures were studied to determine the optimum size of the <b>slip</b> <b>plate.</b> The transfer function between the command displacement signal sent {{to the table and}} the table displacement was developed analytically for the system, encompassing servovalve hydraulics and the PIDF control system...|$|E
40|$|Vibration fixtures, at times, have {{resonant}} frequencies {{that exist}} in the frequency range needed for conducting vibration tests. These resonant frequencies can cause significant problems when running vibration tests over ranges which include these resonances. A test engineer will attempt to control the shaker system through a feedback accelerometer which controls the level of vibration input into the test specimen. However, the control accelerometer can only control the level of vibration at that point. It cannot change the resonant behavior of the vibration fixture. Some problems involving this are described in this article along with some basic material about these phenomena. Often times, vibration tests, are performed to qualify or verify the acceptability of specific hardware for certain environments. We use shaker systems to generate forces or accelerations to replicate some known operating condition or to generate an input spectrum that envelops the actual environment. Usually, a specification mandates the particular input that is needed to satisfy the requirement. The interface between the shaker and the test article is the test fixture. As defined in this article, the test fixture includes the shaker armature, expander head (or <b>slip</b> <b>plate)</b> as well as the attachment fixture (i. e.,. the item designed to accommodate the test specimen). So, when we refer to the fixture, we mean everything between the shaker’s driver coil and the test specimen. (Just because we can’t see the armature, doesn’t mean that it’s not part of the fixture setup). Figure 1 shows a typical schematic of the elements of a fixture...|$|E
40|$|International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) Correction Coil (CC) case, made of {{ultra-low}} carbon {{austenitic stainless}} steel 316 LN with 20 mm thickness, was designed in the outmost layer of the CC, and was used to protect the internal superconducting coil, resist the deformation effect caused by the powerful electromagnetic force and thermal stress during the operation process. These cases have characteristics of small cross-section, large dimension, and complex structure. They {{were divided into two}} parts for the convenience of the internal superconducting coil being inserted into the case, and they will be closure welded together after insertion. Thus, weld seam is located the whole perimeter of the case, which will decide the large quantity weld with the specific distribution caused by the geometric profile of the case. The distribution requires a specific welding system, aim at the CC case closure welding characteristic, should be developed to realize the field welding. The strict deformation requirement, temperature control of internal coil and full penetration with high welding quality brings the technology challenges to this closure welding. The welding system must be constructed and these key technologies must be solved using this welding tooling before the offcial production of CC. A fibre laser robotic welding system was developed for the case closure welding based on the research, scheme design and analysis in this thesis. The specific qualification experiments were carried out on this laser welding system according to technology challenges on the welding quality, temperature control and deformation. Firstly, according to the distribution of weld seam, the preliminary scheme designs of welding systems based on several different welding methods were carried out. It was found that the laser welding is identified as the most suitable welding method. Based on above, reasonable arrangement of robots and external rail, and simulation of robotic welding motion process were carried out in order to further optimize design and analysis. The simulation results show that there exist the dead zone where the robot arm can not doing the effective welding and the robotic welding workspace should be increased. A <b>slip</b> <b>plate</b> module for the welding robot was added to assist travel, after that, the robot was successful in covering all weld seams in all cases. Secondly, to complete this welding system, the welding fixture should be developed to support the welding platform, adjust the assembly tolerance and provide the rigid constrain to control the welding deformation, and electric control should be developed to integrate the welding system and increase its security and stability. A number of ground supports match with the C-type clamps were designed and special distributed aim at the geometric profile of case. The rotatable ground supports, which can provide two types of welding platform, were developed to meet the two different welding positions with arched and concave shape of SCC case. In order to provide the turn over function for SCC case, a welding tilter with tilter framework, single central axis, load-bearing jig was designed base on the good finite element analysis (FEA) result. In addition, the design requirements of the control system of the CC case laser welding were analyzed and the integrated control system was developed based on SIEMENS PLC system S 7 - 300. Thirdly, narrow gap multi-pass laser welding with hot wire was developed as the welding process for the case closure welding. The welded jointed with defects-free and good mechanical properties was achieved based on good optical system, reasonable groove structure and optimized welding procedure. In order to protect the internal superconducting coil, which is inside of the case, the backing strip was designed and welded by laser welding behind the case in the actual welding structure of the CC case. The temperature distribution of the welding process was simulated by FEA and measured by the thermocouples on a short sample. The FEA temperature distribution shows good agreement with the experimental measurement, the highest temperature of the inner face of case was 255 ℃, and the highest temperature record of surface of the internal coil was 59 ℃. The result shows the laser welding process will not harm the superconducting coil, and the welding process, based on the laser welding system, can meet the temperature control requirement. To study the welding deformation, a SCC model case was designed, fabricated and welded by the laser welding system. The principle of positioning welding before continuous welding, as well as segmented, skip, symmetry and repeated turn over, was developed to keep uniform heating of the model case. According to the detected results of welding deformation of the model case, the overall welding deformation was controlled below ± 2 mm. Satisfactory results of the welding deformation of the model case certify the reasonability of the welding structure, system and process of the CC case closure welding, and also provide technical support for the full scale CC case. In conclusion, this thesis study to develop a special robotic laser welding system to solve the CC case closure welding, and some key technologies were studied aim at the related engineering challenges...|$|E
30|$|Discrepancies {{between the}} two results need some explanation. One {{possible}} explanation is that E–W contraction was a short-term feature that would be released by aseismic fault slips either as afterslips following large earthquakes or as unknown slow slip events during interseismic periods. Kawasaki et al. (2001) demonstrated that aseismic fault slips following M 7 class earthquakes along the Japan trench contribute equally to or even larger than the coseismic <b>slips.</b> <b>Plate</b> boundary <b>slips</b> can release interseismic E–W contraction.

40|$|The spatio-temporal {{development}} of an incompressible two-dimensional viscous wake flow confined by two flat <b>slipping</b> <b>plates</b> is investigated by means of direct numerical simulation (DNS), using a spectral Chebyshev multi-domain method. The limit between unstable and stable configurations is determined with respect to several non-dimensional parameters: the confinement, the velocity ratio and two different Reynolds numbers, $ 100 $ and $ 500 $. The comparison of such limit curves with theoretical results obtained by Juniper (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 565, 2006, pp. 171 - 195) confirms {{the existence of a}} region at moderate confinement where the instability is maximal.

30|$|The large slip {{near the}} trench axis {{suggested}} by our study {{is consistent with}} those derived from teleseismic waveform data (Shao et al., 2011; Hayes, 2011; Ammon, 2011; Ide et al., 2011). However, the estimated slip of 57 m at the shallower plate boundary near the trench axis seems to be too large for a typical Mw 9.0 -class earthquake, such as the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake (e.g., Fujii and Satake, 2007). At the moment, it is still unclear whether such a large slip actually occurred in the shallower plate boundary, or a comparable other mechanism, to develop the large vertical deformation of the seafloor which occurred during the earthquake. It is suggested that inelastic deformation resulting from a very soft sediment cover above the trench due to shallow-dipping <b>slip</b> over the <b>plate</b> interface could have enhanced the tsunami amplitude even for an ordinary <b>slip</b> on the <b>plate</b> interface (Tanioka and Seno, 2001; Seno and Hirata, 2007). Additionally, steeply-inclined fault systems cutting the sedimentary layers near the trench off Sanriku (Tsuru et al., 2002), such as the splay fault in the Nankai trough subduction zone (Park et al., 2002), may also cause a similar effect to the large <b>slip</b> of the <b>plate</b> boundary along the shallow plate interface near the trench.|$|R
50|$|At the Salk Institute for Biological Studies (1959-1965) in La Jolla, CA, {{the need}} for {{mechanical}} services (air ducts, pipes, etc.) was so extensive that Kahn decided to create a separate service floor for them above each laboratory floor {{to make it easier}} to reconfigure individual laboratories in the future without disrupting neighboring spaces. He also designed each laboratory floor to be entirely free of internal support columns, making laboratory configuration easier. Komendant engineered the Vierendeel trusses that make this arrangement possible. These pre-stressed concrete trusses are about 62 ft long, spanning the full width of each floor and extending from the bottom of each service floor to the top. They are supported by steel cables embedded in the concrete in a curve similar to that of cables supporting a suspension bridge. Their rectangular openings, which are 6 ft high in the center and 5 ft at the ends, allow maintenance workers to move easily through the thicket of pipes and ducts on the service floors. The trusses impose strictly vertical loads on their support columns, to which they are attached not rigidly but with a system of <b>slip</b> <b>plates</b> and tension cables to permit small movements during moderate earthquakes.|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} new method to monitor <b>slip</b> at the <b>plate</b> {{interface}} using non-volcanic deep-low frequency (DLF) tremors. We {{assume that a}} DLF tremor is the superposition of frequently excited intermittent events, meaning that the envelope of the reduced displacement of the DLF tremor provides an apparent moment rate function. We estimate a conversion factor from the apparent moment to the seismic moment with an assumption that a total size of DLF tremors of an episode {{is proportional to the}} size of corresponding slow slip event (SSE). The cumulative seismic moment estimated by DLF tremors is consistent with that estimated from geodetic methods and provides appropriate slip and slip rate at the plate interface.
