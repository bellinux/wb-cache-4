5|$|Although the {{earliest}} temnospondyls were primarily semiaquatic, {{they had the}} ability to feed on land. Later, eryopoids and dissorophoids, some well adapted to terrestrial life, also fed on land. Some eryopoids became better adapted toward life in water, and <b>shifted</b> <b>their</b> diets toward aquatic organisms. The first primarily aquatic feeders were archegosaurs in the Permian. Trematosaurs and capitosaurs became independently aquatic and also returned to this type of feeding.|$|E
5|$|Originally, Camelot {{planned to}} create a single title instead of a series, and in the {{extremely}} early stages of their project they had created a game design document for the one Golden Sun game {{to be on the}} Nintendo 64 console. When it became apparent the N64 was to be superseded by the GameCube, Camelot <b>shifted</b> <b>their</b> focus to making a game on the handheld Game Boy Advance.|$|E
5|$|The {{controversy}} embroiled leading European universities; the Qing dynasty's Kangxi Emperor {{and several}} popes (including Clement XI and Clement XIV) considered the case; {{the offices of}} the Holy See also intervened. Near the end of the 17th century, many Dominicans and Franciscans had <b>shifted</b> <b>their</b> positions in agreeing with the Jesuits' opinion, but Rome disagreed. Clement XI banned the rites in 1704. In 1742, Benedict XIV reaffirmed the ban and forbade debate.|$|E

5|$|But {{in recent}} years, many {{businessmen}} have <b>shifted</b> <b>their</b> operations {{away from the}} town centre to other suburbs due to a large presence of illegal immigrants from Mindanao islands in the Philippines which has caused trouble, mostly crime such as theft and vandalism on public facility and also solid waste pollution in marine and coastal areas. But later in January 2003, an urban renewal project, was launched to revive the town centre as a commercial hub in Sandakan and since 2013, the Government of Malaysia has launched a major crackdown on illegal immigrants.|$|E
5|$|By 1759, Prussia {{had reached}} a {{strategic}} defensive position in the war. Upon leaving winter quarters in April 1759, Frederick assembled his army in Lower Silesia; this forced the main Habsburg army to remain in its winter staging position in Bohemia. The Russians, however, <b>shifted</b> <b>their</b> forces into western Poland and marched westward toward the Oder river, a move that threatened the Prussian heartland, Brandenburg, and potentially Berlin itself. Frederick countered by sending an army corps commanded by Friedrich August von Finck to contain the Russians; he sent a second column commanded by Christoph II von Dohna to support Finck.|$|E

5|$|By 9 April, the {{pressure}} was decreasing on the New Zealand positions as the Germans <b>shifted</b> <b>their</b> offensive north to the area around Armentières. While {{the bulk of the}} New Zealand Division remained on the Somme and consolidated its defences, some of its artillery went to reinforce the British forces bearing the brunt of the renewed German attacks. Casualties for this period of the war were high; nearly 1,000 of the division's personnel were killed through March and April and almost 2,700 were wounded.|$|E
5|$|Development of Sonic Advance {{began after}} Sega <b>shifted</b> <b>their</b> focus to {{third-party}} software development, {{due to the}} underperformance of the Dreamcast. The company recruited Dimps—a Japanese development studio consisting of former Neo Geo Pocket Color programmers—to lead development, {{with the assistance of}} longtime series developer Sonic Team. While the game follows a similar style of gameplay to the Sega Genesis Sonic games, certain concepts and designs were re-used from newer titles such as Sonic Adventure. The game has since been ported to Nokia's N-Gage and Android devices, and is available on the Wii U via the Virtual Console.|$|E
5|$|Feminism in Russia {{originated}} in the 18thcentury, influenced by the Western European Enlightenment and mostly confined to the aristocracy. Throughout the 19thcentury, the idea of feminism remained closely tied to revolutionary politics and to social reform. In the 20thcentury Russian feminists, inspired by socialist doctrine, <b>shifted</b> <b>their</b> focus from philanthropic works to organizing among peasants and factory workers. After the February Revolution of 1917, feminist lobbying gained suffrage and nominal equality for women in education and the workplace; however, in the 1960s and 1970s, women continued to experience discrimination in certain career-paths (including politics) as well as income inequality and a greater burden of household work. In spite of this, the concern with feminism waned during this period.|$|E

5|$|Harrison placed fifth on {{the first}} ballot, with Sherman in the lead, and the next few ballots showed little change. The Blaine {{supporters}} <b>shifted</b> <b>their</b> support among candidates they found acceptable, and when they shifted to Harrison, they found a candidate who could attract the votes of many other delegations. He was nominated as the party's presidential candidate on the eighth ballot, by a count of 544 to 108 votes. Levi P. Morton of New York was chosen as his running mate.|$|E
5|$|After Prop 17 lost by a voter {{margin of}} 53–47, the project's opponents – which {{had grown to}} include other {{environmental}} groups, such as the Friends of the River and the Sierra Club – <b>shifted</b> <b>their</b> focus on limiting {{the amount of water}} the reservoir could hold, rather than trying to stop the dam altogether. In the meantime, construction on the dam continued to progress. On April 1, 1978 the gates of the diversion tunnel were closed, and New Melones Lake began to fill, soon inundating the old Melones Dam. As the reservoir filled, work moved ahead on the power plant and generating units, which were all completed by the end of 1978. The main embankment of the dam was topped out on October 28, 1978.|$|E
5|$|Although Metzger {{had been}} trying to pitch a movie based on the life of Joseph Süß Oppenheimer for many years, the impetus for the movie came from Joseph Goebbels' desire to make an antisemitic {{response}} to Mendes' philo-semitic film adaptation of Lion Feuchtwanger's 1925 novel Jud Süß. Because Mendes' movie was so sympathetic to the subject, the scriptwriters <b>shifted</b> <b>their</b> model to Wilhelm Hauff's 1827 novella. However, even after Harlan rewrote the original script, the result was not antisemitic enough to suit Goebbels' propaganda needs so he personally intervened in the editing process to the point of dropping some scenes and rewriting others including making a substantial change to the film's ending to show Süß as humbled rather than defiant. Thus, the message of the film was diametrically opposed to the intent of Feuchtwanger's novel. At the same time, however, the film evokes Feuchtwanger’s texts, twisting and reversing the core of the Jewish writer’s work. Although inspired by the historical details of Süß's life, the novel, novella, and film only loosely correspond to the historical sources available at the Landesarchiv Baden-Württemberg.|$|E

5|$|Hong Kong's {{population}} recovered {{quickly after}} the war, as {{a wave of}} skilled migrants from the Republic of China moved in to seek refuge from the Chinese Civil War. When the Communist Party eventually took full control of mainland China in 1949, even more skilled migrants fled across the open border for fear of persecution. Many newcomers, especially {{those who had been}} based in the major port cities of Shanghai and Guangzhou, established corporations and small- to medium-sized businesses and <b>shifted</b> <b>their</b> base operations to British Hong Kong. The establishment of a socialist state in China (People's Republic of China) on 1 October 1949 caused the British colonial government to reconsider Hong Kong's open border to mainland China. In 1951, a boundary zone was demarked as a buffer zone against potential military attacks from communist China. Border posts along the north of Hong Kong began operation in 1953 to regulate the movement of people and goods {{into and out of the}} territory.|$|E
5|$|In 1230 the Teutonic Knights, a crusading {{military}} order, {{moved to}} Chełmno Land and launched the Prussian Crusade against the pagan Prussian clans. With {{support from the}} pope and Holy Roman Emperor, the Teutons conquered and converted the Prussians by the 1280s and <b>shifted</b> <b>their</b> attention to the pagan Grand Duchy of Lithuania. For about 100 years the Knights raided Lithuanian lands, particularly Samogitia, as it separated the Knights in Prussia from their branch in Livonia. While the border regions became an uninhabited wilderness, the Knights gained very little territory. The Lithuanians first gave up Samogitia during the Lithuanian Civil War (1381–1384) in the Treaty of Dubysa. The territory {{was used as a}} bargaining chip to ensure Teutonic support for one of the sides in the internal power struggle.|$|E
5|$|KWGN and KPLR moved The CW's primetime lineup {{one hour}} later (to 8:00 p.m.) than the network-recommended timeslot, and <b>shifted</b> <b>their</b> evening newscasts to 7:00 p.m. (weekend {{editions of the}} evening newscasts were {{discontinued}} with the move; KPLR has since expanded its 7:00 p.m. newscast to Saturday and Sunday evenings) to avoid competing with KDVR and KTVI's 9:00 p.m. newscasts; KWGN retained its weekday morning newscast (which competes directly with KDVR's morning newscast), but canceled its 5:30 p.m. – and later, 11:00 a.m. – newscasts. In contrast, KPLR (which had run a primetime newscast for much of its history) eventually added hour-long midday and late afternoon newscasts. The two LMA arrangements became legal duopolies in December 2013, once Tribune finalized its acquisition of Local TV.|$|E

5|$|Lithium {{was used}} to {{decrease}} the melting temperature of glass and to improve the melting behavior of aluminium oxide when using the Hall-Héroult process. These two uses dominated the market {{until the middle of}} the 1990s. After the end of the nuclear arms race, the demand for lithium decreased and the sale of Department of Energy stockpiles on the open market further reduced prices. In the mid 1990s, several companies started to extract lithium from brine which proved to be a less expensive than underground or open-pit mining. Most of the mines closed or <b>shifted</b> <b>their</b> focus to other materials because only the ore from zoned pegmatites could be mined for a competitive price. For example, the US mines near Kings Mountain, North Carolina closed before the beginning of the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|Reactions to {{the death}} of Gaveston varied considerably. Edward was furious and deeply upset over what he saw as the murder of Gaveston; he made {{provisions}} for Gaveston's family, and intended to take revenge on the barons involved. The earls of Pembroke and Surrey were embarrassed and angry about Warwick's actions, and <b>shifted</b> <b>their</b> support to Edward in the aftermath. To Lancaster and his core of supporters, the execution had been both legal and necessary to preserve the stability of the kingdom. Civil war again appeared likely, but in December, the Earl of Pembroke negotiated a potential peace treaty between the two sides, which would pardon the opposition barons for the killing of Gaveston, in exchange for their support for a fresh campaign in Scotland. Lancaster and Warwick, however, did not give the treaty their immediate approval, and further negotiations continued through most of 1313.|$|E
5|$|After {{speeches in}} favor of the other front-runners, Garfield rose to place Sherman's name in nomination; his nominating speech was well-received, but the delegates mustered little {{excitement}} for the idea of Sherman as the next president. The first ballot showed Grant leading with 304 votes and Blaine in second with 284; Sherman's 93 placed him in a distant third. Subsequent ballots quickly demonstrated a deadlock between the Grant and Blaine forces, with neither having the 379 votes needed for nomination. Jeremiah McLain Rusk, a member of the Wisconsin delegation, and Benjamin Harrison, an Indiana delegate, sought to break the deadlock by shifting a few of the anti-Grant votes to a dark horse candidate—Garfield. Garfield gained 50 votes on the 35th ballot, and the stampede began. Garfield protested to the other members of his Ohio delegation that he had not sought the nomination and had never intended to betray Sherman, but they overruled his objections and cast their ballots for him. In the next round of voting, nearly all of the Sherman and Blaine delegates <b>shifted</b> <b>their</b> support to Garfield, giving him 399 votes and the Republican nomination. Most of the Grant forces backed the former president to the end, creating a disgruntled Stalwart minority in the party. To obtain that faction's support for the ticket, former New York customs collector Chester A. Arthur, a member of Conkling's political machine, was chosen as the vice-presidential nominee.|$|E
