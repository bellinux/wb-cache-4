The rivers become icebound during the winter, although the areas with strong rapids freeze later or not at all.|$|E

Population growth in the 1970 Census was <b>small,</b> <b>but</b> positive, with Teaneck reaching its historical maximum of 42,355. Absolute declines in population followed in both the 1980 (−7.9%) and 1990 (−3.0%) data. The 2000 Census showed recovery in Teaneck's population to 39,260, though growth (3.8%) was smaller than in Bergen County overall (7.1%).|$|E
5|$|Agricultural and {{forestry}} work were the traditional {{uses of the}} Finnhorse. The Finnhorse was never bred to be a particularly large or heavy draught horse, {{as it was the}} only horse breed of the country, and versatility was desired as the Finnhorse was also used as the primary steed of the cavalry. The climate and conditions of Finland necessitated that the breed be durable and hardy. As a result, the Finnhorse remained <b>small</b> <b>but</b> tough, and could pull heavy loads in difficult terrain and even in chest-deep snow. Relative to its size, the Finnhorse is among the most powerful workhorses in the world with the best animals able to pull as much as 200percent of their own weight.|$|E

Canavan noted small olfactory tracts, and said that Southard had difficulty detecting certain smells. The arteries {{at the base of}} his brain were <b>small,</b> <b>but</b> the significance of this finding was unclear. The distinctive features of Southard's brain did not appear in those of his mother or father.|$|E
