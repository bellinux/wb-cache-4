5|$|At {{least partly}} {{explaining}} why both Lamb and Hazlitt felt {{the inadequacy of}} Shakespearean stage performances was that the theatres themselves were huge and gaudy, audiences were noisy and unmannerly, and dramatic presentations {{in the early nineteenth}} century were sensationalistic, laden with artificial and showy props. In addition, unless one <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pit, one could easily miss the subtleties of the actors' facial and vocal expressions.|$|E
5|$|One major {{demonstration}} {{took place}} in the Shi'a island of Sitra, where several thousand men, women, and children took to the streets. According to witnesses interviewed by Physicians for Human Rights, hundreds of fully armed riot police arrived on the scene and immediately began firing tear gas and sound grenades into the crowds. They then fired rubber bullets into the unarmed crowd, aiming at people in the front line who had <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> street in protest.|$|E
5|$|Although Phra Candasaro {{had studied}} with many masters, and had {{mastered}} many important Pali texts, {{he was not}} satisfied. He withdrew himself in the more peaceful area of his hometown twice. Some sources state he also withdrew himself in the jungles to meditate more, but Newell doubts this. In the eleventh rains retreat (vassa) after his ordination, in 1916, he stayed at Wat Botbon at Bangkuvieng, Nonthaburi Province. Wat Botbon was the temple {{where he used to}} receive education as a child, a temple known for its peacefulness. As seen from Luang Pu Sodh's autobiographical notes, he reflected to himself that he had been practicing meditation for many years and had still not understood the essential knowledge which the Buddha had taught. Thus, on the full-moon day in the tenth lunar month of 1916, he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> main shrine hall of Wat Botbon, resolving not to waver in his practice of sitting meditation, whatever might disturb his single-mindedness. That same night he experienced in meditation {{what became known as the}} attainment of the Dhammakaya, which marked the start of Dhammakaya meditation as a tradition.|$|E

They were filmed by anti-war activists and video clips were distributed. The students then marched around the city centre and ended up back at Albert Square at about 4pm where they remained demonstrating in front of the Town Hall for some hours. The whole of this event was filmed by anti-war activists accumulating two hours of footage.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, Tucker {{organized}} a sit-in at Alexandria Library, which refused to issue library cards to black residents. On August 21, five {{young black men}} whom Tucker had recruited and instructed – William Evans, Otto L. Tucker, Edward Gaddis, Morris Murray, and Clarence Strange – entered the library one by one, requested applications for library cards and, when refused, each one took a book off the shelf and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reading room until they were removed by the police. Tucker had instructed the men to dress well, speak politely and offer no resistance to the police so as to minimize the chance of the men being found guilty of disorderly conduct or resisting arrest. Tucker defended {{the men in the}} ensuing legal actions, which resulted in the disorderly conduct charges against the protestors being dropped by city attorney Armistead Boothe (who would later become a key figure in desegregating Virginia schools), and in a branch library being established for blacks.|$|E
500|$|The act {{occurred}} {{at the intersection of}} Phan Đình Phùng Boulevard (now Nguyễn Đình Chiểu Street) and Lê Văn Duyệt Street (now Cách Mạng Tháng Tám Street) at , a few blocks southwest of the Presidential Palace (now the Reunification Palace).

As the marchers formed a circle around him, Đức calmly <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> traditional Buddhist meditative lotus position on the cushion. A colleague emptied the contents of the petrol container over Đức's head. Đức rotated a string of wooden prayer beads and recited the words [...] ("Homage to Amitābha Buddha") before striking a match and dropping it on himself. Flames consumed his robes and flesh, and black oily smoke emanated from his burning body.|$|E

2500|$|In 1907, Joseph Quincy Adams, Jr., {{suggested}} that Heywood {{might have been}} influenced by Lucian’s Icaro-Menippus when representing Jupiter on earth, notably the passage: “…close to every one was placed a golden chair. [...] Jupiter <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first he came to, and lifting up the lid, listened to the prayers, which, as you may suppose, were of various kinds…One sailor asked for a north-wind, another for a south; the husbandmen prayed for rain, and the fuller for sun-shine…One petition, indeed, puzzled him a little; two men asking favors of him, directly contrary to each other, at the same time, and promising the same sacrifice; he was at a loss which to oblige.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In the passage, Jesus has <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{temple to}} teach {{some of the}} people, after he spent the {{previous}} night at the Mount of Olives. [...] A group of scribes and Pharisees confront Jesus, interrupting his teaching session. They bring in a woman, accusing her of committing adultery, claiming she {{was caught in the}} very act. They ask Jesus whether the punishment for someone like her should be stoning, as prescribed by Mosaic Law. Jesus first ignores the interruption, and writes on the ground as though he does not hear them. But when the woman's accusers continue their challenge, he states that the one who is without sin is the one who should cast the first stone. The accusers and congregants depart, leaving Jesus alone with the woman. [...] Jesus asks the woman if anyone has condemned her. She answers that no one has condemned her. Jesus says that he, too, does not condemn her, and tells her to go and sin no more.|$|E
2500|$|Confident in his skill, Mannock {{arrived in}} France on 31 March 1917 at 40 Squadron {{headquarters}} near Aire, Lens. He {{did not give}} his new squadron-mates a good first impression. On his first night he inadvertently <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chair of a popular pilot killed that day and proceeded to ask pilots about their personal scores and offer, without invitation, his own views on air combat. Lieutenant Lionel Blaxland recalled; [...] "He seemed a boorish know-all, we all felt the quicker he got amongst the Huns the better; that would show him how little he knew." [...] Mannock flew the squadrons Nieuport 17 scout the following day. As the days passed, he preferred to remain airborne {{by virtue of his}} squadron's hostility. The public school boy-dominated squadron detested his [...] "gutter politics" [...] and mannerisms although Mannock was befriended by Irishman Lieutenant de Burgh, of the same ilk. Mannock would forge friendships with new pilots. George McElroy arrived in September and became Mannock's protégé.|$|E

2500|$|In November 1965, {{an article}} was {{published}} involving an antique oak rocking chair {{said to have}} been previously owned by attorney Charlie Willett, a Bell descendant. The rocking chair was recently sold in an estate sale to Mrs. J. C. Adams, owner of an antique store on U.S. 41. A customer <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chair, after learning it was not for sale, and while rocking in the chair asked Mrs. Adams if she believed in the supernatural. Two weeks later, the customer's daughter visited the home of Mrs. Adams and said after her mother had left and visited the Bell cemetery a voice told her to [...] "stand up and look around, you will find something of much value." [...] After some car trouble, the woman walked out into a field and found a black iron kettle turned over. She turned the kettle over and found a pearl buckle in the grass. The woman's daughter reported a jeweler estimated the buckle to be 160 to 200 years old.|$|E
2500|$|When the councillors of Sweden {{had chosen}} Gustav as king, {{he met with}} the two visiting councillors of Lübeck. The German representatives {{supported}} the appointment without hesitation and declared it an act of God. Gustav stated he had to bow to what was described as the will of God. In a meeting with the Privy Council, Gustav Eriksson announced his decision to accept. In the following ceremony, led by the deacon of Strängnäs, Laurentius Andreae, Gustav swore the royal oath. The next day, bishops and priests joined Gustav in Roggeborgen where Laurentius Andreae raised the holy sacrament above a kneeling Gustav Eriksson. Flanked by the councillors of Lübeck, Gustav Eriksson was brought to Strängnäs Cathedral where the king <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> choir with the Swedish privy councillors on one side, and the Lübeck representatives on the other. After the hymn [...] "Te Deum", Laurentius Andreae proclaimed Gustav Eriksson king of Sweden. He was, however, still not crowned. In 1983, in remembrance of the election of Gustav as Swedish king on 6 June, that date was declared the National Day of Sweden.|$|E

There the trail ended and I <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water. [...] I was nearly out of breath. I started to rise out of the water, and when I came out I was born by my mother. When I was born I could know and see and understand for a time, but afterwards went back to it as a baby. [...] Then I grew up naturally. [...] At the age of seven I began to learn, and when twelve began to fight enemies. That was the reason I always refused to wear any war-dress. [...] Only a bit of grass in the hair. [...] That was why I always was successful in battles. The first fight was with the Shoshones. The Shoshones were chasing the Sioux. [...] I, with my younger brother riding double. [...] Two of the Shoshones came for us. [...] We started to meet them. [...] I killed one of them and took his horse. [...] We jumped on him, my brother and I double, and escaped." ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{stood in}} his first county game in 1970. [...] Three years later, he officiated at his first Test match, England v New Zealand at Headingley in Leeds. The other umpire was Charlie Eliott as England won by an innings and one run. [...] Bird was to umpire again twice more that summer, {{in the second and}} third tests of the tour by the West Indies - both of which proved eventful: in the second test at Edgbaston, Bird had to umpire from the bowler's end at both ends for couple of overs, with a {{substitute}} umpire at square leg, when Arthur Fagg refused to continue in protest against the conduct of the West Indian players. And then at Lords, play was interrupted by an IRA bomb scare (later found out to be a hoax). While the crowd cleared out of the ground in record time, Bird and the players <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> centre of the pitch, knowing there was no bomb there. [...] He gained a reputation for stopping play for weather, and almost never giving batsmen out LBW - he gave LBWs so seldom that if he did give it, there was absolutely no doubt the batsman was out. [...] Bird was also very strict on the definitions of [...] "intimidatory bowling", both from short-pitched deliveries and high full tosses, and made it abundantly clear he would tolerate none of it.|$|E
2500|$|Sassoon's {{periods of}} duty on the Western Front {{were marked by}} {{exceptionally}} brave actions, including the single-handed capture of a German trench in the Hindenburg Line.

A pointless feat, since instead of signalling for reinforcements, he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> German trench and began reading a book of poems which he had brought with him. When he went back he did not even report. Colonel Stockwell, then in command, raged at him. The attack on Mametz Wood had been delayed for two hours because British patrols were still reported to be out. [...] "British patrols" [...] were Siegfried and his book of poems. [...] "I'd have got you a D.S.O., if you'd only shown more sense," [...] stormed Stockwell.Sassoon's bravery was inspiring to the extent that soldiers of his company said that they felt confident only when they were accompanied by him. He often went out on night-raids and bombing patrols and demonstrated ruthless efficiency as a company commander. Deepening depression at the horror and misery the soldiers were forced to endure produced in Sassoon a paradoxically manic courage, and he was nicknamed [...] "Mad Jack" [...] by his men for his near-suicidal exploits.

2500|$|In June 1800, McGready {{was joined}} at Red River by several area Presbyterian ministers, {{including}} William Hodge, John Rankin (whom McGready had recently appointed the minister for the Gasper River congregation), and the brothers, William and John McGee, the latter a Methodist minister who, some years later, wrote his {{account for the}} Methodist Missionary Magazine. [...] His narrative painted a vivid picture of the revival’s beginnings: [...] “All was silent until Monday, {{the last day of}} the feast. … [...] While Mr. Hodge was preaching, a woman in the East end got an uncommon blessing, broke through order, and shouted for some time and then sat down in silence." [...] McGee continued, relating that most of the ministers were already gathered outside the meeting house while the people remained seated inside, unwilling to leave, when his brother, William, “felt such a power come on him that he quit his seat and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> floor of the pulpit." [...] John McGee began to tremble as weeping erupted through the congregation. [...] The woman in the east end began to shout again and McGee started toward her just as someone reminded him that his Presbyterian hosts were “much for order” and would not “hear this confusion; go back and be quiet." [...] McGee turned to go back and was “near falling” when he changed his mind and “went through the house shouting and exhorting with all possible ecstasy and energy." [...] Using the term that came to be associated with the revival phenomenon of collapsing in a state of physical helplessness, McGee continued: [...] “The floor was soon covered with the slain; their screams for mercy pierced the heavens.” ...|$|E
