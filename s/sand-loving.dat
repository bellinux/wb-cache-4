25|$|Amrum's {{vegetation}} {{is determined}} by the sea and by the different types of landscapes on the island, most of which are low in nutrients. In parts of the dune belt and on the Kniepsand marram grass or sea wormwood grow, as well as numerous other <b>sand-loving</b> plants like sheep's bit which will bloom in sheltered areas between the dunes. Also some stunted pines, bent by the sea wind, and Salix repens, the creeping willow can be found there. Until the 1970s, the rare sea holly could still be seen in the dunes.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work {{was to assess the}} {{conservation}} status of coastal dune systems in Tuscany (Italy). Emphasis was given to the presence and abundance of plant communities identified as habitat in accordance with the Directive 92 / 43 /EEC. Twenty transects perpendicular to the shoreline were randomly positioned on the whole coastal area (30 km in length) in order to sample the full spectrum of plant communities. Vegetation zonation and relationships with the most frequent disturbance factors in the study area – beach cleaning, coastline erosion, presence of paths and roads, bathing settlements and trampling – were investigated through Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCO) and Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). Natural factors, such as distance from the sea and total length, were also considered. Differences in the conservation status of the sites were found, ranging from the total disappearance of the foredune habitats to the presence of the complete psammophilous (<b>sand-loving)</b> plant communities. Erosion, trampling and paths were found to be closely correlated with degradation and habitat loss. Furthermore, the overall plant species diversity of dunes was measured with NHDune, {{a modified version of the}} Shannon index; while the incidence of invasive taxa was calculated using N, a naturalness index. However, these diversity indices proved to be a weaker bioindicator of ecosystem integrity than habitat composition along transects. A possible strategy for the conservation and management of these coastal areas could be to protect the foredunes from erosion and limit trampling through the installation of footbridges or the use of appropriate fences...|$|E
40|$|Natural and {{anthropogenic}} disturbances {{are important}} structuring agents in rocky intertidal communities. Here, {{the impacts of}} disturbance {{in the form of}} human trampling and periodic sand inundation on the invertebrates and algae of coralline algal turf communities were evaluated. First, a preliminary observational study of the turf communities at eight rocky intertidal sites indicated that differences in invertebrate community composition, diversity, and abundances existed among sites and sampling times. Density and diversity were highest in an area that has been closed to public use and lowest at the most heavily visited sites. In order to quantify the timing and extent of sand inundations to a rocky intertidal area, observations of sand depth were made along a large, permanent grid system for 21 months. Inundations of sediment were relatively rapid and lasted on the order of one to two months, while erosion was equally rapid. The presence of sand was negatively correlated to the maximum significant wave height for that time period. The use of time-lapse video proved to be an efficient method for collecting vast amounts of data regarding patterns of human visitation to the rocky intertidal. It was observed that the amount of visitation was highly site-specific. Time of day and week were more important predictors of visitation than was the height of the tide. The coralline turf invertebrate communities exhibited rapid responses to disturbance in manipulative studies, but also appeared to recover rapidly. An acute, or "pulse", disturbance in the form of controlled sand addition caused an immediate exodus of highly mobile taxa and then a gradual increase in psammophilic (<b>sand-loving)</b> gastropods. A more continuous, or "press", disturbance in the form of human trampling caused a decrease in density and diversity of coralline turf invertebrates. In both cases, a return to control abundances occurred within one to nine months, indicating a resilient system. The results of these studies fill an important gap in the knowledge of the natural history of rocky intertidal communities and the processes which shape them. Additionally, the techniques and results presented here will be valuable for future management decisions in protected coastal area...|$|E
40|$|The {{national}} wildlife refuge at Chincoteague, Virginia, {{is one of the}} newest in a chain of sanctuaries placed along the flight lanes of the waterfowl. Coming down from the north the principal links of the chain are Parker River, Montezuma, Susquehanna, Brigantine, and Bombay Hook. Then from Chincoteague the links run south, through Back Bay and Pea Island, Mattamuskeet and Cape Romain. Chincoteague, like other waterfowl refuges, is needed because birds migrate, and because in so doing they expose themselves to great dangers. The migration of birds is one of the ancient spectacles of earth, {{and one of the most}} mysterious. But while we know little about why birds migrate or how they find their way over enormous distances, common sense tells us this: like human travelers, birds must have places where they can stop in safety for food and rest. Once there were plenty of natural hostelries for the migrants. That was before our expanding civilization had drained the marshes, polluted the waters, substituted resort towns for wilderness. That was in the days when hunters were few. In those days our waterfowl probably numbered 200 million. Now only a small remnant of this number is left. If we are to preserve the remaining waterfowl, and the sports and recreations which depend on them, we must set apart for the birds refuges like Chincoteague, where they may find these simple and necessary creature requirements: food, rest, security. Chincoteague was selected as a refuge site because the biologists of the Fish and Wildlife Service, after years of searching for the best spot to fill the gap between the refuges at Bombay Hook and Back Bay, decided that this wild seacoast island on the Eastern Shore of Virginia would provide protection and breeding territory for the greatest number of species. Purchase of this site for a refuge was approved by the Migratory Bird Commission in 1942; and the refuge was formally placed under administration by the Fish and Wildlife Service in 1945. Two things determined the location of the Chincoteague Refuge: its physical features, combining beaches, dunes, marshes, woodland, and protected waters; and its position with relation to the flight lanes of the birds. As to the first: About nine thousand acres in area, the refuge occupies the southern third of Assateague Island, separated from Chincoteague Island by a narrow channel. Assateague is one of the barrier islands typical of the Middle Atlantic coast, never more than three miles from shore to shore, lying between Chincoteague Bay and the sea. Seen from the air, as the migrating waterfowl coming in from the north must see it, its eastern border is a wide ribbon of sand that curves around in a long arc at the southern end of the island to form a nearly enclosed harbor. Back from the beach the sand mounts into low dunes, and the hills of sand are little by little bound and restrained by the beach grasses and the low, succulent, <b>sand-loving</b> dune plants. As the vegetation increases, the dunes fall away into salt marshes, bordering the bay. Like islands standing out of the low marsh areas are the patches of firmer, higher ground, forested. with pine and oak and carpeted with thickets of myrtle, bayberry, sumac, rose, and catbriar. Scattered through the marshes are ponds and potholes filled with wigeongrass and bordered with bulrushes and other good food for ducks and geese. This is waterfowl country. This is the kind of country the ducks knew in the old days, before the white man 2 ̆ 7 s civilization disturbed the face of the land. This is the kind of country that is rapidly disappearing except where it is preserved in wildlife sanctuaries. The pattern of the flyways, more than any other fact, determines the location of the waterfowl refuges. A flyway is more than a migration route-it is a whole geographic region. There are four such flyways in the United States: the Atlantic, the Mississippi, the Central, and the Pacific. Although the breeding grounds of the various flyways overlap, each has its own wintering grounds, and a complex system of migration paths leading from winter to summer areas. 23 pages, with illustrations by Shirley A.
