40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} usage of thin and {{high strength steel}} roof battens in the roof structures of low-rise buildings, recent cyclones and storms have shown that they prematurely fail at their <b>screw</b> <b>fastener</b> connections to the rafters or trusses due to the screw heads pulling through the batten bottom flanges. Such pull-through failures can lead to catastrophic failures of the entire roofing systems as observed during recent high wind events. Therefore a detailed experimental study consisting of both small scale and full scale tests was undertaken to investigate the pull-through failures of roof battens under wind uplift loading in relation to many critical parameters such as <b>screw</b> <b>fastener</b> tightening, roof batten geometry, batten thickness, steel grade, <b>screw</b> <b>fastener</b> head size and <b>screw</b> <b>fastener</b> location.

40|$|In recent times, the roofing systems made of {{thin and}} high {{strength}} steel roof sheeting and battens or purlins are predominantly used {{in the construction of}} low-rise buildings. However, such thin steel roofing systems continue to fail frequently at their <b>screw</b> <b>fastener</b> connections during high wind events such as storms and cyclones due to inadequate connection capacities. Localised pull-out failures occurring at the thin steel roof sheeting to batten or purlin connections have been the root cause for extensive loss of roofing systems under high wind uplift loads over many years. Such premature connection failures often cause partial or even complete loss of steel roofing systems and, thus allowing rainwater to cause severe damage to building contents. Therefore a detailed experimental study was conducted to investigate the pull-out failures occurring at the steel roof sheeting to batten or purlin connections. One hundred and eighty-seven small scale pull-out tests were conducted for this purpose using a range of <b>screw</b> <b>fastener</b> sizes and many thicknesses of thin steel roof battens and purlins.

40|$|High wind uplift loads {{acting on}} the light gauge steel roofing systems during {{tropical}} cyclones and storms frequently cause premature failures of roof connections, which lead to extensive damage to roofing systems. Such roofing system damage was observed in recent cyclones due to premature failures of steel roof batten to rafter/truss connections.

Hence a series of small scale and full scale tests of roof battens was first conducted to study their pull-through failures.

40|$|Thin {{profiled}} steel {{roof sheeting}} and battens are increasingly {{used in the}} construction of roofing systems of residential, commercial, industrial and farm buildings in Australia. The critical load combination of external wind suction and internal wind pressures that occur during high wind events such as thunderstorms and tropical cylcones often dislocate the roofing systems partially or even completely due to premature roof connection failures. Past wind damage investigations have shown that roof sheeting failures occured at their screw connections to battens. In most of these cases, the <b>screw</b> <b>fastener</b> head pulled through the thin roof sheeting whilst the screw fasteners also pulled out from the battens. Research studis undertaken on the roof sheeting to batten connection failures have improved this situation. However, the batten to rafter or truss connections have not been investigated adequately. Failure of these connections can cause the failure of the entire roof structure as observed during the recent high wind events.

40|$|Mechanical {{behavior}} of the shear connections has a significant influence on both the load-carrying capacity and the bending stiffness of timber-concrete composite (TCC) beams. All the studies reported so far have concentrated {{on the performance of}} TCC connections in mature concrete. The performance of shear connections for TCC beams at early concrete ages, however, has not been investigated yet. This information is essential to evaluate the structural {{behavior of}} TCC floors or bridges during construction. In this paper, a total of 18 push-out tests with concrete ages ranging from 12 h to 28 days are performed, to investigate the early-age performance of lag screw shear connections in the lightweight concrete. Development of concrete strength with time is also analyzed. At the concrete ages shorter than 7 days, both the stiffness and strength of the screw connectors increase evidently with time, which follows the same growth trend with the concrete strength. After a 7 -day cure, screw shear connections reach almost 100 % of both the 28 -day serviceability slip modulus and shear strength. Material properties of the glulam and the <b>screw</b> <b>fastener</b> are decisive in the shear performance of connections when the concrete hardens to some degree.

40|$|Light {{gauge steel}} roofing systems made of thin {{profiled}} roof sheeting and battens are used commonly in residential, industrial and commercial buildings. Their critical design load combination is {{that due to}} wind uplift forces that occur during high wind events such as tropical cyclones and thunderstorms. However, premature local failures at their screw connections have been a concern for many decades since cyclone Tracy that devastated Darwin in 1974. Extensive research that followed cyclone Tracy on the pull-through and pull-out failures of roof sheeting to batten connections has significantly improved the safety of roof sheeting. However, this has made the batten to rafter/truss connection the weakest, and recent wind damage investigations have shown the failures of these connections and the resulting loss of entire roof structures. Therefore an experimental research program using both small scale and full scale air-box tests is currently under way to investigate the pull-through failures of thin-walled steel battens under high wind uplift forces. Tests have demonstrated that occurrence of pull-through failures in the bottom flanges of steel batttens {{and the need to}} develop simple test and design methods as a function of many critical parameters such as steel batten geometry, thickness and grade, <b>screw</b> <b>fastener</b> sizes and other fastening details.

40|$|The use of cold-formed steel {{structures}} is increasing rapidly {{around the world}} due to the many advances in construction and manufacturing technologies and relevant standards. However, the structural behaviour of these thin-walled {{steel structures}} is characterised by a range of buckling modes such as local buckling, distortional buckling or flexural torsional buckling. These buckling problems generally lead to severe reduction and complicated calculations of their member strengths. Therefore {{it is important to}} eliminate or delay these buckling problems and simplify the strength calculations of cold-formed steel members. The Hollow Flange Beam with two triangular hollow flanges, developed by Palmer Tube Mills Pty Ltd in the mid- 1990 s, has an innovative section that can delay the above buckling problems efficiently. This structural member is considered to combine the advantages of hot-rolled I-sections and conventional cold-formed sections such as C- and Z-sections (Dempsey, 1990). However, this structural product was discontinued in 1997 due to the complicated manufacturing process and the expensive electric resistance welding method associated with severe residual stresses (Doan and Mahendran, 1996). In this thesis, new fastening methods using spot-weld, <b>screw</b> <b>fastener</b> and self-pierced rivet were considered for the triangular Hollow Flange Beams (HFBs) and the new rectangular hollow flange beams (RHFBs). The structural behaviour of these types of members in axial compression was focused in this research project. The objective of this research was to develop suitable design models for the members with triangular and rectangular hollow flanges using new fastening methods so that their behaviour and ultimate strength can be predicted accurately under axial compression. In the first stage of this research a large number of finite element analyses (FEA) was conducted to study the behaviour of the electric resistance welded, triangular HFBs (ERW-HFBs) under axial compression. Experimental results from previous researchers were used to verify the finite element model and its results. Appropriate design rules based on the current design codes were recommended. Further, a series of finite element models was developed to simulate the corresponding HFBs fastened using lap-welds (called LW-HFBs) and screw fasteners or spot-welds or self-piercing rivets (called S-HFBs). Since the test specimens of LW-HFBs and S-HFBs were unavailable, the finite element results were verified by comparison with the experimental results of ERW-HFB with reasonable agreement. In the second stage of this research, a total of 51 members with rectangular hollow flanges including the RHFBs made from a single plate and 3 PRHFBs made from three plates fastened with spot-welds and screws was tested under axial compression. The finite element models based on the tests were then developed that included the new fasteners, contact simulations, geometric imperfections and residual stresses. The improved finite element models were able to simulate local buckling, yielding, global buckling and local/global buckling interaction failure associated with gap opening as agreed well with the corresponding full-scale experimental results. Extensive parametric studies for the RHFBs made from a single plate and the 3 PRHFBs made from three plates were undertaken using finite element analyses. The analytical results were compared with the predictions using the current design rules based on AS 4100, AS/NZS 4600 and the new direct strength method. Appropriate design formulae based on the direct strength method for RHFBs and 3 PRHFBs were developed. This thesis has thus enabled the accurate prediction of the behaviour and strength of the new compression members with hollow flanges and paved the way for economical and efficient use of these members in the industry...|$|E
