5|$|Academic reviewers {{were mostly}} positive, but several raised {{concerns}} over Berger's incorrect use of terminology. Reviewers noted the study's importance in developing Pagan <b>studies</b> <b>as</b> an academic discipline and helping further the wider sociological investigation into new religious {{movements in the}} United States. In the years following the study's publication, Berger continued to investigate the Pagan community, focusing her interest on the popularity of Wicca among teenagers.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{its history}} Goofus and Gallant has been {{interpreted}} as an effective didactic comic. It {{has been used in}} several <b>studies</b> <b>as</b> a stimulus to prompt children to identify kind and unkind actions, and the characters of Goofus and Gallant, as archetypes of badness and goodness, have been referenced in several works by philosophers.|$|E
5|$|Women {{have tended}} to be {{overlooked}} in Byzantine <b>studies</b> <b>as</b> Byzantine society left few records about them. Women were disadvantaged in some aspects of their legal status and in their access to education, and limited in their freedom of movement. The life of a Byzantine Greek woman could be divided into three phases: girlhood, motherhood, and widowhood.|$|E
50|$|A {{plane is}} a flat, {{two-dimensional}} surface that extends infinitely far. Planes {{are used in}} every area of geometry. For instance, planes can be <b>studied</b> <b>as</b> a topological surface without reference to distances or angles; it can be <b>studied</b> <b>as</b> an affine space, where collinearity and ratios can be studied but not distances; it can be <b>studied</b> <b>as</b> the complex plane using techniques of complex analysis; and so on.|$|R
50|$|Affine {{space is}} usually <b>studied</b> <b>as</b> {{analytic}} geometry using coordinates, or equivalently vector spaces. It {{can also be}} <b>studied</b> <b>as</b> synthetic geometry by writing down axioms, though this approach is much less common. There are several different systems of axioms for affine space.|$|R

5|$|A chavrusa {{helps the}} student stay awake, keep his mind {{focused on the}} learning, sharpen his {{reasoning}} powers, develop his thoughts into words, and organize his thoughts into logical arguments. This type of learning also imparts precision and clarity into ideas that would otherwise remain vague. Having to listen to, analyze and respond to another's opinion inculcates respect for others. It is considered poor manners to interrupt one's chavrusa. The chavrusa relationship also strengthens the student's personal commitment to his <b>studies,</b> <b>as</b> he is loathe to disappoint or cancel on his chavrusa.|$|E
5|$|Acrocanthosaurus is {{classified}} in the superfamily Allosauroidea within the infraorder Tetanurae. This superfamily is characterized by paired ridges on the nasal and lacrimal bones {{on top of the}} snout and tall neural spines on the neck vertebrae, among other features. It was originally placed in the family Allosauridae with Allosaurus, an arrangement also supported by <b>studies</b> <b>as</b> late as 2000. Most studies have found it {{to be a member of}} the related family Carcharodontosauridae.|$|E
5|$|Apart from a {{definition}} of leisure, there are other questions of theoretical concern to the sociologist of leisure. For example, quantifying the results is difficult, as time-budget studies have noted that a given amount of time (for example, an hour) may have different values, depending on when it occurs—within a day, a week, or a year. Finally, as with many other fields of inquiry in the social sciences, {{the study of the}} sociology of leisure is hampered by the lack of reliable data for comparative longitudinal <b>studies,</b> <b>as</b> there was little to no standardized data-gathering on leisure throughout most of human history. The lack of longitudinal studies has been remedied in the last few decades by recurring national surveys such as the General Household Survey in the United Kingdom (ongoing since 1971). In addition to surveys, an increasing number of studies have been focusing on qualitative methods of research (interviews).|$|E

5|$|Carney {{was born}} in St. Joseph, Missouri and was raised and educated at {{military}} posts in the U.S. as well as abroad where his parents were stationed, including in Bad Tolz, Germany, Fort Bliss, Texas and Taipei, Taiwan. His father served in the United States Army in the early 1940s before being assigned to the Judge Advocate Generals Corps in 1948. His mother, daughter of a surgeon in St. Joseph, raised Carney and his two siblings as the family moved from one military posting to another. He received his Bachelor of Science degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1966 and the U.S. Foreign Service sent him on a brief sabbatical to study at Cornell University from 1975 until 1976, focusing on Southeast Asian <b>studies</b> <b>as</b> part of his career. Carney {{was a member of}} the board of the American Academy of Diplomacy and speaks Khmer, Thai and French fluently.|$|E
5|$|Drama {{is equally}} important, with plays staged {{throughout}} the school year, the main performance being at Great Academies, whilst some students take Theatre <b>Studies</b> <b>as</b> an additional AS Level subject. The college has a traditional theatre, the Academy Room, and a high-tech theatre built at St Mary's Hall {{as part of the}} Centenaries Appeal in 1993. The latter plays host to the annual Ribble Valley International Piano Week. Several former pupils have gone on to achieve success upon the stage, including OSCAR-winning actor and director Charles Laughton and BAFTA-winning director and producer Peter Glenville.|$|E
5|$|Each {{graduate}} school offers {{at least one}} double degree with another {{graduate school}}.

He seduced a major who {{was attached to the}} San Francisco recruiting station on the condition that the major approve Sarria's enlistment. Jose Sarria was approved and entered the Army Reserve, continuing his <b>studies</b> <b>as</b> he waited to be called up to active duty. Shortly before he was scheduled for induction in the regular Army, his beloved second father, Charles Millen, died of a heart attack. Sarria's induction was delayed a month, then he was sworn in and ordered to Sacramento, California, for basic training with the Signal Corps.|$|E
5|$|From 1951 to 1963, Stevens {{served as}} {{vice-president}} of the Lucy Stone League, though she struggled with maintaining militancy. Stevens was not anti-male, rather pro-female. She {{did not follow}} a belief that for women to succeed, men had to be omitted; rather, she believed that collaboration with men was essential. In her last years, Stevens supported the establishment of feminist <b>studies</b> <b>as</b> a legitimate field of academic inquiry in American universities and tried to establish a Lucy Stone Chair of Feminism at Radcliffe College.|$|E
5|$|Master's and {{doctoral}} programs are offered through the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the Law Center, the School of Medicine, the McCourt School of Public Policy, and the School of Continuing Studies. Masters students occasionally share some advanced seminars with undergraduates, and most undergraduate schools offer abbreviated bachelors and masters programs following {{completion of the}} undergraduate degree. The McDonough School of Business and the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service both offer masters programs. The School of Foreign Service is renowned for its academic programs in international affairs. Its graduate program was ranked first {{in the world by}} Foreign Policy and its undergraduate program was ranked fourth. The Center for Contemporary Arab Studies also offer a Master's of Arab <b>Studies,</b> <b>as</b> well as certificates.|$|E

5|$|Performers {{are first}} trained in acrobatics, {{followed}} by singing and gestures. Several performing schools, {{all based on}} the styles of famous performers, are taught. Some examples are the Mei Lanfang school, the Cheng Yanqiu school, the Ma Lianliang school, and the Qi Lintong school. Students previously trained exclusively {{in the art of}} performance, but modern performance schools now include academic <b>studies</b> <b>as</b> well. Teachers assess the qualifications of each student and assign them roles as primary, secondary, or tertiary characters accordingly. Students with little acting talent often become Peking-opera musicians. They may also serve as the supporting cast of foot soldiers, attendants, and servants that is present in every Peking-opera troupe. In Taiwan, the Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of China runs a national Peking-opera training school.|$|E
