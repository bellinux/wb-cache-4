25|$|Although WMAQ-TV {{has since}} moved to NBC Tower {{about a mile}} away, {{and for the most}} part the 19th floor of the Mart has been turned into office space, one former tenant (Bankers Life and Trust Company) {{maintained}} a remnant of the original studios as their video and multimedia department. The former WMAQ space is currently being redeveloped by Flashpoint Academy as a full modern soundstage facility as well as a <b>screening</b> <b>room,</b> backlot, and classroom space over the 19th and 20th floors.|$|E

25|$|After the <b>screening</b> <b>room</b> incident, Hughes {{moved into}} a {{bungalow}} at the Beverly Hills Hotel where he also rented rooms for his aides, his wife, and numerous girlfriends. He would sit naked in his bedroom with a pink hotel napkin placed over his genitals, watching movies. This may have been because Hughes found the touch of clothing painful due to allodynia. He may have watched movies to distract himself from his pain—a common practice among patients with intractable pain, especially {{those who do not}} receive adequate treatment. In one year, Hughes spent an estimated $11million at the hotel.|$|E
50|$|An RF {{anechoic}} chamber is usually {{built into a}} <b>screened</b> <b>room,</b> designed using the Faraday cage principle. This is {{because most of the}} RF tests that require an {{anechoic chamber}} to minimize reflections from the inner surfaces also require the properties of a <b>screened</b> <b>room</b> to attenuate unwanted signals penetrating inwards and causing interference to the equipment under test and prevent leakage from tests penetrating outside.|$|R

25|$|In 1958, Hughes {{told his}} aides {{that he wanted}} to screen some movies at a film studio near his home. He stayed in the studio's darkened <b>screening</b> <b>room</b> for more than four months, never leaving. He ate only {{chocolate}} bars and chicken and drank only milk, and was surrounded by dozens of Kleenex boxes that he continuously stacked and re-arranged. He wrote detailed memos to his aides giving them explicit instructions not to look at him nor speak to him unless spoken to. Throughout this period, Hughes sat fixated in his chair, often naked, continually watching movies. When he finally emerged in the summer of 1958, his hygiene was terrible. He had not bathed nor cut his hair and nails for weeks; this may have been due to allodynia, which results in a pain response to stimuli that would normally not cause pain.|$|E

500|$|The Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Roth v. United States (1957) that the First Amendment did not protect {{obscenity}}. It also {{ruled that the}} Hicklin test was inappropriate; instead, the Roth test for obscenity was [...] "whether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest". This definition proved hard to apply, however, and in the following decade, members of the Court often reviewed films individually in a court building <b>screening</b> <b>room</b> {{to determine if they}} should be considered obscene. Justice Potter Stewart, in Jacobellis v. Ohio (1964), famously stated that, although he could not precisely define pornography, [...] "I know it when I see it".|$|E

500|$|Back at {{the office}} that Monday, Lasseter {{assembled}} the company in a <b>screening</b> <b>room</b> and pitched the revised version of Toy Story 2 from exposition to resolution. Story elements were recycled from the original drafts of the first Toy Story. [...] The original film's original opening sequence featured a Buzz Lightyear cartoon playing on television, which evolved into the Buzz Lightyear video game that would be shown in the opening Toy Story 2. A deleted scene from Toy Story, featuring Woody having a nightmare involving him being thrown into a trash can, was incorporated in a milder form for depicting Woody's fear of losing Andy. [...] The idea of a squeak-toy penguin with a broken squeaker also resurfaced from {{an early version of}} Toy Story.|$|E
500|$|By January 1969, {{the single}} [...] "If I Can Dream", {{written for the}} special, reached number 12. The soundtrack album broke into the top ten. According to friend Jerry Schilling, the special {{reminded}} Presley of what [...] "he {{had not been able}} to do for years, being able to choose the people; being able to choose what songs and not being told what had to be on the soundtrack.... He was out of prison, man." [...] Binder said of Presley's reaction, [...] "I played Elvis the 60-minute show, and he told me in the <b>screening</b> <b>room,</b> 'Steve, it's the greatest thing I've ever done in my life. I give you my word I will never sing a song I don't believe in.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The film Valkyrie, {{starring}} {{and produced}} by Tom Cruise, premiered in New York City on December 17. Entertainment reporter Roger Friedman {{noted that it}} was held [...] "in the private <b>screening</b> <b>room</b> at the Time Warner Center. Not the [...] or Loews Lincoln Square, where most premieres are held in public." [...] The venue was chosen in part to minimize the exposure to Scientology protestors gathered at the Time Warner Center. For the same reason, Cruise arrived at the December 18 Los Angeles screening through an underground tunnel. There were also Scientology protests at the European premiere in Berlin, where one protester got his V for Vendetta mask autographed by Tom Cruise. Chanology participants shared the limelight with {{a person in a}} bunny suit protesting against the hero worship of Claus von Stauffenberg.|$|E

500|$|In November 1997, Disney {{executives}} Roth and Peter Schneider {{viewed the}} film's story reels, with some finished animation, in a <b>screening</b> <b>room</b> at Pixar. [...] They {{were impressed with}} the quality of work and became interested in releasing Toy Story 2 in theaters. [...] In addition to the unexpected artistic caliber, there were other reasons that made the case for a theatrical release more compelling. [...] The economics of a direct-to-video Pixar release were not working as well as hoped thanks to the higher salaries of the crew. [...] After negotiations, Jobs and Roth agreed that the split of costs and profits for Toy Story 2 would follow the model of a newly created five-film deal—but Toy Story 2 would not count as one of the five films. Disney had bargained in the contract for five original features, not sequels, thus assuring five sets of new characters for its theme parks and merchandise. [...] Jobs gathered the crew and announced the change in plans for the film on February 5, 1998.|$|E
500|$|On the way {{to their}} {{vacation}} spot, Lois falls asleep. Unfortunately, Peter doesn't {{pay attention to the}} road, deciding instead to read a comic book while driving, and crashes the car into a tree. They are forced to spend their entire honeymoon money on car repairs and are about to return home when Peter discovers that actor/director Mel Gibson has a private suite at a luxurious hotel nearby, [...] "which he barely uses". He and Lois then go to the hotel, where Peter poses as Gibson to gain access to his room. When Lois yells out Gibson's name during intercourse, Peter, again, decides to return home. As the two are about to leave, Peter accidentally stumbles upon Gibson's private <b>screening</b> <b>room</b> and discovers a sequel to The Passion of the Christ entitled The Passion of the Christ 2: Crucify This. To spare the world from [...] "...another two hours of Mel Gibson Jesus mumbo-jumbo," [...] Peter steals the film. However, when they leave the hotel, they are noticed by two priests, Gibson's associates, who were there to collect the film.|$|E
500|$|When Valkyrie premiered in New York City on December 15, 2008, it {{was shown}} in a private <b>screening</b> <b>room</b> at the Time Warner Center, rather than at a Lincoln Square theater. The venue was chosen in part to {{minimize}} the exposure to Scientology protesters gathered at the Time Warner Center. Protesters also appeared at the December 18 Los Angeles screening, where Cruise entered through a tunnel. While the US [...] "red carpet" [...] was held in private, Cruise interacted with fans in South Korea and Europe. There were small anti-Scientology protests at the European premiere in Berlin, where Cruise signed one protester's Guy Fawkes mask. Anti-Scientology protests also occurred at the London premiere, and Amsterdam where Scientologists in the crowd engaged the protesters. The NTV news report about the January 26 Moscow premiere noted that journalists had to sign a document promising not {{to ask questions about}} Scientology, and their questions would be censored; to this, the reporter remarked, [...] "You can't help getting reminded of those historic times depicted in Operation Valkyrie." ...|$|E
