Now believing Magnus is who <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>is,</b> Zimmerman recounts {{the events of the}} plague to her; ten years ago, a {{contagion}} was released in Old City, transforming humans to cannibalistic creatures. When containing the city failed, the disease spread throughout the globe and despite her best efforts, Magnus could not find a cure and was eventually killed in Buenos Aires. Several world governments deployed nuclear weapons in an attempt to stop the threat until they fell. All Sanctuary personnel apart from Zimmerman were killed in the process. Only around 100,000 unaffected humans remain in colonies in the Arctic and remote islands. Jessica is revealed to be infected and alerts the creatures to the Sanctuary after she transforms, forcing Zimmerman to kill her. Both Magnus and Zimmerman fortify one section of the Sanctuary so Magnus can learn, via computer files, how the plague started. Zimmerman is revealed to have been infected during his last skirmish, and sacrifices himself to buy Magnus more time.|$|E

He asks if she is alright, to which <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>is,</b> and just as he is about to leave she picks up the vase he glued for her and says she wants him to have it. Eli asks again if she is alright, and she politely asks him to leave. Later that day, after Mary Alice had shot herself, Eli watches police cars and neighbors gossiping from afar, regretting that he did nothing to save her. He then makes a vow to God to not only fix people's belongings but their lives as much as he can as well.

2500|$|Other {{moments in}} the series suggest that other Time Lords have {{more control over their}} {{regeneration}} than that usually displayed by the Doctor. Prior to regenerating in the episode [...] "Utopia", the Master expresses a desire to be [...] "young and strong" [...] like the Doctor and transforms accordingly. Subsequently, in [...] "Last of the Time Lords", the Master is shot by Lucy Saxon and is able to prevent regeneration at will, despite the Doctor's pleas. In [...] "The Stolen Earth," [...] the Doctor begins to regenerate in a cliffhanger moment, but at the start of [...] "Journey's End" [...] (the following episode), he interrupts the process after healing his bodily injuries, redirecting the remaining regeneration energy into his preserved hand. In [...] "Let's Kill Hitler", when Mels begins to regenerate into River Song, <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> trying to concentrate so she can come out a particular dress size. In [...] "Nightmare in Silver", the Eleventh Doctor suggests that he can trigger regeneration voluntarily, using the suggestion to threaten the Cyber-Planner invading his body and mind, saying [...] "I could regenerate now. Big blast of regeneration energy, burn out any little Cyber widgets in my brain, along with everything you're connected to. Don't want to. Use this me up, who knows what we'll get next? But I can." [...] (Even though by The Time Of The Doctor this was revealed to be a bluff {{due to the fact that}} the Eleventh Doctor was actually the final incarnation of his first regeneration cycle.) In [...] "The Girl Who Died, the Twelfth Doctor speculates that he deliberately, if not subconsciously, chose the form of Caecilius (from [...] "The Fires of Pompeii") to remind himself that he is a man who always saves people, even if it is just one. In [...] "The Doctor Falls", the Doctor is wounded by Cybermen and starts to regenerate, but is able to hold back his regeneration, refusing to change again.|$|E
2500|$|The series seven opener [...] "Asylum of the Daleks" [...] (2012) shows Amy, {{still working}} as a fashion model, signing papers for her and Rory's divorce. In the episode, the Doctor {{engineers}} a reconciliation between the two during the mission, allowing them to discuss their feelings for each other. It is revealed Amy left Rory because she has been infertile since [...] "A Good Man Goes to War", and knew he wanted children. The couple continue traveling with the Doctor on small adventures in [...] "Dinosaurs on a Spaceship" [...] and [...] "A Town Called Mercy", but leave {{at the end of}} each to return to their normal lives. In [...] "The Power of Three", Amy says that the Doctor has been in her and Rory's life for ten years, and she now works as a journalist. The couple realise they have to choose between their normal lives and their life with the Doctor. They are inclined to choose the former, but Rory's father Brian (Mark Williams) encourages the pair to continue travelling with the Doctor. Their next adventure, [...] "The Angels Take Manhattan", is their last. In the story, Amy and Rory are threatened by the evil Weeping Angels, whose touch will send them into the distant past to die alone. Having witnessed this eventuality, they attempt suicide, creating a paradox which destroys all but one Angel, but also renders the area permanently off-limits to the Doctor's TARDIS. In the present, the surviving Angel sends Rory back in time, and knowing the Doctor cannot recover him, Amy allows the Angel to touch her too so she can be with him. Gravestones in a New York cemetery reveal that Rory died at the age of 82 and Amy died at the age of 87. River arranges for Amy to leave the Doctor a message in the afterword of a 1930s pulp fiction novel, where <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> happy with Rory and that they worry about the Doctor travelling alone. [...] "P.S.", a mini shows-episode supplement based on the original script for this episode, shows that Rory and Amy adopted a son, in 1946, and named him Anthony Brian Williams. The actress reprised the role in [...] "The Time of the Doctor" [...] (2013), in which Matt Smith departs the series. During the Eleventh Doctor's regeneration, he hallucinates images of young Amelia Pond on board his TARDIS, before a vision of adult Amy approaches and says a final goodbye.|$|E
