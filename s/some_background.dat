5|$|Gilbert Foliot's letters provide <b>some</b> <b>background</b> to Chesney's election, {{showing that}} King Stephen of England and Stephen's brother Henry of Blois, the Bishop of Winchester, {{attempted}} to secure Lincoln {{for one of}} their relatives: the royal candidates were the abbots of Fécamp, Westminster, and St Benet's of Hulme. They were rejected by Pope Eugene III, {{paving the way for}} the chapter to elect Chesney. Foliot relates that the electors from the chapter travelled to London, where they proceeded to elect Chesney in front of Foliot, Theobald, and some other bishops. That account is contradicted by Chesney's profession of obedience to Theobald, which claims that the election took place on 13December 1148 at Westminster. Henry of Huntingdon and Ralph de Diceto, both medieval chroniclers, approved of the election and mentioned the unanimous nature of Chesney's selection. That Chesney's brother William was a firm supporter of Stephen's probably helped reconcile Stephen and his brother to Chesney's election.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was mostly mixed. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. The two noted that the [...] "X-File in itself is an interesting concept, but left frustratingly vague." [...] Shearman and Pearson, however, did positively write that the episode is [...] "a character study which gives its new leads <b>some</b> <b>background</b> and depth and, better yet, somewhere new to develop." [...] VanDerWerff later awarded the episode an [...] "C+" [...] and wrote that [...] "there {{are a lot of}} things to like in “Empedocles,” but the central conceit is just too stupid for the episode as a whole to work." [...] While he enjoyed the [...] "way that [...] features all four FBI agents in the same episode", he was critical of both the plot and the Mulder and Scully dynamic, noting that it fell flat.|$|E

500|$|Henry was the {{youngest}} of William and Matilda's four sons. Physically he resembled his older brothers Robert Curthose, Richard and William Rufus, being, as historian David Carpenter describes, [...] "short, stocky and barrel-chested," [...] with black hair. As a result of their age differences and Richard's early death, Henry would have probably seen relatively little of his older brothers. He probably knew his sister, Adela, well, as the two were close in age. There is little documentary evidence for his early years; historians Warren Hollister and Kathleen Thompson suggest he was brought up predominantly in England, while Judith Green argues he was initially brought up in the Duchy. He was probably educated by the Church, possibly by Bishop Osmund, the King's chancellor, at Salisbury Cathedral; it is uncertain if this indicated an intent by his parents for Henry to {{become a member of the}} clergy. It is also uncertain how far Henry's education extended, but he was probably able to read Latin and had <b>some</b> <b>background</b> in the liberal arts. He was given military training by an instructor called Robert Achard, and Henry was knighted by his father on 24 May 1086.|$|E
500|$|After {{agreeing to}} rework the {{material}} that Ralbovsky had found so objectionable, Gilmour employed session musicians such as Carmine Appice and Jim Keltner. [...] Both drummers, they later replaced Mason {{on most of the}} album's songs; Mason was concerned that he was too out of practice to perform on the album, and instead busied himself with its sound effects. [...] Some of the drum parts were also performed by drum machines. During the sessions, Gilmour was asked by the wife of Pink Floyd's former keyboard player, Richard Wright, if he too could contribute to the project. [...] A founding member of the band, Wright had left in 1979, and there were certain legal obstacles to his return, but after a meeting in Hampstead he was brought back in. [...] Gilmour later admitted in an interview with author Karl Dallas that Wright's presence [...] "would make us stronger legally and musically". [...] He was therefore employed as a paid musician, on a weekly wage of $11,000, but his contributions were minimal. [...] Most of the keyboard parts had already been recorded, and so from February 1987 Wright played <b>some</b> <b>background</b> reinforcement on a Hammond organ, and a Rhodes piano, along with adding several vocal harmonies. The keyboardist also performed a solo in [...] "On the Turning Away", which was discarded, according to Wright, [...] "not because they didn't like it...they just thought it didn't fit." [...] Gilmour later said: [...] "Both Nick and Rick were catatonic in terms of their playing ability at the beginning. Neither of them played on this at all really. [...] In my view, they'd been destroyed by Roger …" [...] Gilmour's comments angered Mason, who reflected: [...] "I'd deny that I was catatonic. [...] I'd expect that from the opposition, it's less attractive from one's allies. [...] At some point, he made some sort of apology." [...] Mason did concede, however, that Gilmour was nervous about how the album would be perceived.|$|E
