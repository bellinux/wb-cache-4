5000|$|The {{language}} of accounting is repeated from Sonnet 5. The image of [...] "usury" [...] refers to replication of the invested [...] "essence" [...] in offspring, {{in the same}} way that money earns interest. The propagation of children can never be exploitative. Shakespeare's own father had been accused in 1570 of usury, of charging 20% and 25% interest. Elizabethan divines preached uncompromisingly against usury in principle but often tolerated it in practice: the Act against Usury of 1571, while providing punishments for usury above and below 10%, unwittingly legitimized a <b>standard</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> of 10%. Thus, Shakespeare plays with tens, and a tenfold return on the investment is to be desired.|$|E
50|$|The cost of capital, {{applied to}} a {{purchase}} of a car, {{is the amount of}} money the car owner could have obtained, if they, instead of buying the car, applied that amount of money to other worthy investment. The cost of capital is the rate of return that capital could be expected to earn in an alternative investment of equivalent risk. Considering by default the car has depreciation, and that such depreciation is already considered at a certain cost item, the cost of capital of owning a car, is then the income that the car owner could have obtained with the money spent on such car. One example could be a common <b>standard</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> in a deposit account.|$|E

Under r 8 of the 1994 Reg’s (now r 12) the DG sought an injunction to stop the bank using the term, because it was unfair. Lord Goodhart submitted that the term merely concerned the adequacy of the bank’s remuneration, therefore fell under r 3(2) (now r 6(2)). The DG submitted it was a core term and unfair because complaints were made and the 1991 Order had excluded interest.|$|E

5000|$|When in forms {{other than}} money, {{financial}} capital may be traded on bond markets or reinsurance markets {{with varying degrees}} of trust in the social capital (not just credits) of bond-issuers, insurers, and others who issue and trade in financial instruments.

Often such instruments are called fixed-income instruments if they have reliable payment schedules associated with the uniform <b>rate</b> of <b>interest.</b> A variable-rate instrument, such as many consumer mortgages, will reflect the standard rate for deferred payment set by the central bank prime rate, increasing it by some fixed percentage.

Because the credibility of the gold standard regime is an important determinant of domestic <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> uncertainty, the latter is endogenously linked to changes in the fundamental determinants. Applying this analysis to the inter-war period, the paper shows that GARCH measures of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> uncertainty rose dramatically in the U.
