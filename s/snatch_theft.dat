40|$|The current crime {{situation}} today creates public {{anxiety and}} is {{a constant source of}} discussion and debate along the corridors of academia, profesional and parties involved in the field. Almost every day we hear news of crime which increases our feelings of fear and highlights our concern regarding the level of public safety. This anxiety also reflects the Statistical Crime Report from the Royal Malaysian Police (PDRM) indicating an increase in criminal cases from the year 2005 to the year 2007. This fear concerns the dip in quality of life that could affect social activities and the national economic well-being. Feelings of fear of crime exceeding actual crime rate gives an illustration of the ebb of social life today and loss of faith in designs for public safety. Fear of crime affects many people and needs to be taken seriously. Although statistically most people have a low chance of becoming a victim of crime, many people nevertheless fear crime. This scenario occurs because almost everyday we come across reports of crime and violence in Malaysia. There have been many reports of crime: <b>snatch</b> <b>thefts,</b> rapes, and other sex-related crimes, assaults and murders, child abuse and ill treatment of foreign maids, hold-ups and petty thefts, kidnappings, fatal road accidents, etc. With this barrage of media reporting, there is an air of anxiety and fear as to what the future will hold for our Malaysian society and subsequently their quality of life. These reports give the impression that our safety in Malaysia is decreased. This follows the depreciation of Public Safety Index in the Malaysian Quality of Life Index (MQLI) 2004. Therefore, fear of crime has become an important issue of public concern which detracts from the quality of life. This paper will discuss the existing causes of fear of crime and trends of crime in Malaysia as important aspects of deterioration in quality of life of Malaysians. Prevention of crime through environmental design will also be discussed in this paper as it has now become a national initiative in overcoming the stated problem in Malaysia...|$|R

40|$|Using {{the example}} of {{motorcycle}} ban policy in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong province, this article examines how situational crime prevention strategies are used in contemporary urban China. The article argues that although a motorcycle ban policy may reduce motorcycle <b>snatch</b> <b>theft</b> (feiche qiangduo) in Guangzhou, it inevitably caused a problem of displacement. However, some types of displacement are desirable for local government. An argument about drive-away policing is proposed in this article to understand policing styles in contemporary China. In addition, the article argues that motorcycle ban, as a strategy to prevent <b>snatch</b> <b>theft</b> and robbery, is also a strategy {{to deal with the}} crisis in police legitimacy. Therefore, crime prevention in China has more social and political significance than just reducing crime. Â© 2012 The Author(s). link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The study {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between space and crime by using space syntax. The aim is to describe the spatial characteristics of the built environment and the spatial distribution of crime pattern. The space syntax variables {{are connected to the}} statistical data on street crime data registered in Annaba. This inquiry seeks to identify the spatial features of the crime locations to understand {{the relationship between}} the spatial configuration and crime behaviour. Most studies on space and crime in European cities deal with burglars and auto-theft. However, this inquiry focuses on two types of street crime, occurring frequently in urban open public space of Algerian cities, namely <b>snatch</b> <b>theft</b> and mugging. Therefore, the results from space syntax analyses of Annabaâ street network is made and put into GIS. Likewise, a crime registration map was generated in GIS to visualize the overall distribution patterns of crime. This map is correlated with various space syntax measures. Most European studies on space and crime shows that crime takes place in the more segregated and poorly connected streets. However, the finding of this research shows that the more integrated and well-connected and controlled streets are, the higher numbers of <b>snatch</b> <b>theft</b> and mugging. One explanation might be that segregated streets tend to have no potential victims, and hence, it affects the numbers of <b>snatch</b> <b>theft</b> and mugging. Spatial Planning and Strateg...|$|E

40|$|Crimes {{continue}} {{to be one of}} the major concerns in contemporary Malaysian societies especially in the cities. Urban population concentrating in high density has increased opportunities for crimes to occur. There have been evidences that crime incidents are related to land use. This paper discusses a study carried out to investigate the relationship between the nature of crimes committed in a city in Malaysia and the cityâs land use characteristics. A total of 2, 062 crime incidents categorized into theft, <b>snatch</b> <b>theft,</b> burglary at night and burglary at daylight were analyzed in the study. Spatial statistics was employed to uncover the relationship between types of crime and land use variables such as density, transportation network, land use types, etc. Spatial statistics analyses used were mean center, directional distribution, distribution pattern and hot spot analyses. The findings from the study show that crimes in the area do follow a certain pattern according to crime types and land use variables such as density, accessibility and land use types. These revelations can be helpful to the local authority in reducing crime and in enhancing neighborhood safety. In addition, utilizing spatial statistic function would also help authority such the police department in understanding the crime pattern and finding the best action in preventing crimes...|$|E
