40|$|Introduction One of the {{products}} made by SAAB Avionics Systems in Jönköping {{was in need of}} a better cooling solution. The product, a Head-Up Display, holds a LED that was overheating when run at desired input power. The purpose of this thesis was to identify the design weaknesses in the current solution regarding heat dissipation and produce new design proposals that fulfill the requirements. The parts analyzed consist of a LED light source, <b>adjustment</b> <b>plates</b> and a heat sink. The <b>adjustment</b> <b>plates</b> and heat sink where covered in a surface treatment. Theoretical framework A simulation of a finite element model was set up of the current solution in order to identify the influence of the different parts and their thermal properties. The simulation was set up as a steady state thermal model. The FEM and steady state equations used during this are mentioned and shortly explained. The state of modern research was found in order to find new innovative ways of solving the heat problem. Method In order to understand the current solution, experimentswere carried out. Interviews were used {{in order to get the}} correct information easily. A literature study was preformed to understand the different theories. Reverse engineering was applied to get a detailed understanding of the functionality both mechanically and thermally. Brainstorming was used to generate new solutions, which was followed by a feasibility evaluation and Pugh’s method to sort out the best concepts. Implementation and Result Based on the simulations it can be concluded that some of the developed solutions pass the requirements and can be implemented right away. Some need some more work in order to fully pass the demands. Conclusions The thermal flow was greatly affected by the properties of the aluminum in the <b>adjustment</b> <b>plates</b> and heat sink, though there was not much room for thickness reduction. However, the oxide layer and the surface roughness also had a great impact on the high junction temperature. The requirements where therefore met when <b>adjustment</b> <b>plates</b> and interfaces were removed, to lower the amount of oxide and air between the LED and the heat sink. But the oxide layers needed to be thinner and the surface roughness needed to be reduced in order to meet requirements. If the oxide layers need to stay at current thickness or the surface roughness cannot be changed, the heat sink needs to be redesigned. The recommended concepts were smaller than the current solution. If this space is utilized with a bigger heat sink, the goals can be met with greater ease. There is also room for improvement when it comes to heat sink heat spreader pattern. Discussion The discussion covers what knowledge which was needed to write this thesis and how different problems that occurred along its path were solved. Sustainability in different ways was also discussed...|$|R

The elimination of an available camber adjustment may reduce maintenance requirements, {{but if the}} car is lowered by use of shortened springs, the camber angle will change. Excessive camber angle can lead to increased tire wear and impaired handling. Significant suspension modifications may correspondingly require that the upper control arm or strut mounting points be altered to allow for some inward or outward movement, relative to longitudinal centerline of the vehicle, for camber <b>adjustment.</b> Aftermarket <b>plates</b> with slots for strut mounts instead of just holes are available {{for most of the}} commonly modified models of cars.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} a reduction of an adhesive stain defect in flexible printed circuit board in hot pressing process, the electronic factory. The manufacturing have been processing by sheet type of products with ninety-six pieces of flexible printed circuit boards. Causes of the problem include the before and internal hot pressing process. In process beginning times, the most right row of products between the cooling plate and the hot pressing machine has temperature 71. 2 ◦C that is higher than glass transition temperature (Tg) 60 ◦C. Those products’ temperature lead to evaporate a polyimide adhesive before hot pressing process beginning. The internal hot pressing process include the preheat times and the pressure time. In the preheat time the problem is a gap between lower and upper plate, was under specification (Under 1 mm) and leaded to adhesive polyimide stain. In the actuality this time requires temperature and low pressure that mean a gap within 1 – 2 mm (between lower and upper plate). In pressure times the hot pressing plate surface is not flat and products are pressed by insufficient force that it lead to generate an adhesive stain on flexible printed circuit boards. That force is measured by the pre-scale paper and a result, RGB color, is provided. And then color density (From standard color sample) and RGB color (From pre-scale paper) is found out the relation by Photoshop program and multiple regression theory using. The formula is applied to compare with defect so as to find out the suitable color density (Defects reducing). The solving solutions is provided including the gap reduced <b>adjustment</b> between cooling <b>plate</b> and hot pressing machine before hot pressing process, the <b>plate</b> <b>adjustment</b> within specification in the preheat time and the pressing plate polishing in the pressure time. Results of study and solving are provide defect reduction from 24. 4 percentage to 7. 2 percentage of total study product. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} a wavelet transform based method for extracting license plates from cluttered images. The proposed system {{consists of three}} major stages. First, a wavelet transform based method is used for extracting important contrast features as guides to search for desired license plates. Then, finding a reference line in HL subimage {{plays an important role}} to locate the desired license plate region roughly. According to the reference line we can decrease the searching region of license plate and speed up the execution time. The last stage of the method is to locate the license plate accurately by license <b>plate</b> <b>adjustment.</b> More importantly, the proposed detection method can locate multiple plates with different orientations in one image. Since the feature extracted is robust to complex backgrounds, the proposed method works well in extracting differently illuminated and oriented license plates. The average accuracy of detection is 92. 4 %...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFor a customer, one of {{the most}} {{appealing}} areas aesthetically in a passenger vehicle is the frontal and side closure of the vehicle. Especially the way the precision tolerances are achieved in cars. Hence the precision tolerance gives the aesthetic appeal for gap and flushness. It plays a vital role in the saleability of the vehicle. There are three priority areas of a passenger car which influences the prospective customer. The priority 1 includes the front-rear door and headlamp-hood interfaces. The priority 2 includes the A pillar to roof and front wind shield interfaces. The priority 3 includes door to rocker moulding and hood to grille interfaces. Here the importance is given to the customer's view perspective. For example, in a side closures (car door assembly), the front-rear door interfaces which lies between the B pillar and the rear door region is given importance since it has the high priority as seen by the customer (Priority 1). Whereas the door to rocker moulding interfaces which lies on the bottom surface of the car is given low priority (Priority 3). Based on these priorities the gap and flushness effectively achieved through the tolerance management. This research paper aims to investigate the influences of tolerancing methods and aspects of perceived quality on the side closures with respect to computer aided tolerancing, hinge positioning, <b>Striker</b> and hinge <b>adjustments</b> and hemming. These influences in turn gives the side closures superior aesthetic appeal, loyal customers and winning edge in the saleability of luxury cars in the global market...|$|R
40|$|Residuals of a {{conventional}} <b>plate</b> <b>adjustment</b> of 5, 687 plates of the Second Cape Photographic Catalogue (CPC 2) using the Southern Reference Star (SRS) Catalog were analyzed to search for systematic errors depending on {{the location of the}} star images on the plate. Even after correcting for third order optical distortion, such coordinate depending systematic errors, hereafter called field distortion pattern (FDP), were detected which are nearly constant with respect to plate epoch, location in the sky and apparent brightness of the stars. The mean amplitude of these field distortions was found to be 57 milliarcseconds (mas), which is 0. 57 µm on a plate. Due to the favorable 4 –fold overlap observing principle of the CPC 2, the effect on the mean catalog position is only a fraction of that. But the FDP affects a block adjustment (BA) of the entire set of data on a 100 mas level at the border of the CPC 2 sky coverage. A comparison with FDP’s found in other projects was made and physical reasons for the FDP were investigated. Publication of a new release of the CPC 2 is planned after the Hipparcos Output Catalog becomes available in 1996.

The {{goal of this}} project {{was to examine the}} performance of Multiplex arrays for measuring multiple protein biomarkers in saliva and serum. Specimens from the OsteoPerio ancillary study of the Women’s Health Initiative Observational Study were used. Participants required the presence of at least 6 teeth and were excluded based on active cancer and certain bone issues but were not selected on any specific condition. Quality control (QC) samples were created from pooled serum and saliva. Twenty protein markers were measured on five multiplexing array panels. Sample pretreatment conditions were optimized for each panel. Recovery, lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) and imprecision were determined for each analyte. Statistical <b>adjustment</b> at the <b>plate</b> level was used to reduce imprecision estimates and {{increase the}} number of usable observations. Sample pre-treatment improved recovery estimates for many analytes. The LLOQ for each analyte agreed with manufacturer specifications except for MMP- 1 and MMP- 2 which were significantly higher than reported. Following batch adjustment, 17 of 20 biomarkers in serum and 9 of 20 biomarkers in saliva demonstrated acceptable precision, defined as, 20 % coefficient of variation (, 25 % at LLOQ). The percentage of cohort samples having levels within the reportable range for each analyte varied from 10 % to 100 %. The ratio of levels in saliva to serum varied from 1 : 100 to 28 : 1.

40|$|The Mariana arc-trench system, the easternmost of {{a series}} of backarc basins and {{intervening}} remnant arcs that form {{the eastern edge of the}} Philippine Sea Plate, is a well-known example of an intraoceanic convergence zone. Its evolution has been studied by numerous investigators over nearly two decades (e. g., Kang, 1971; Uyeda and Kanamori, 1979; LaTraille and Hussong, 1980; Fryer and Hussong, 1981; Mrosowski et al., 1982; Hussong and Uyeda, 1981; Bloomer and Hawkins, 1983; Karig and Ranken, 1983; McCabe and Uyeda, 1983; Hsui and Youngquist, 1985; Fryer and Fryer, 1987; Johnson and Fryer, 1988; Johnson and Fryer, 1989; Johnson et al., 1991). The Mariana forearc has undergone extensive vertical uplift and subsidence in response to seamount collision, to tensional and rotational fracturing associated with <b>adjustments</b> to <b>plate</b> subduction, and to changes in the configuration of the arc (Hussong and Uyeda, 1981; Fryer et al., 1985). Serpentine seamounts, up to 2500 m high and 30 km in diameter, occur in a broad zone along the outer-arc high (Fryer et al., 1985; Fryer and Fryer, 1987). These seamounts may be horsts of serpentinized ultramafic rocks or may have been formed by the extrusion of serpentine muds. Conical Seamount, one of these serpentine seamounts, is located within this broad zone of forearc seamounts, about 80 km from the trench axis, at about 19 ° 30 'N. The seamount is approximately 20 km in diameter and rises 1500 m above the surrounding seafloor. Alvin submersible, R/V Sonne bottom photography, seismic reflection, and SeaMARC II studies indicate that the surface of this seamount is composed of unconsolidated serpentine muds that contain clasts of serpentinized ultramafic and metamorphosed mafic rocks, and authigenic carbonate and silicate minerals (Saboda et al., 1987; Haggerty, 1987; Fryer et al., 1990; Saboda, 1991). During Leg 125, three sites were drilled (two flank sites and one summit site) on Conical Seamount to investigate the origin and evolution of the seamount. Site 778 (19 ° 29. 93 'N, 146 ° 39. 94 'E) is located in the midflank region of the southern quadrant of Conical Seamount at a depth of 3913. 7 meters below sea level (mbsl) (Fig. 2). This site is located in the center of a major region of serpentine flows (Fryer et al., 1985, 1990). Site 779 (19 ° 30. 75 'N, 146 ° 41. 75 'E), about 3. 5 km northeast of Site 778, is located approximately in the midflank region of the southeast quadrant of Conical Seamount, at a depth of 3947. 2 mbsl. This area is mantled by a pelagic sediment cover, overlying exposures of unconsolidated serpentine muds that contain serpentinized clasts of mafic and ultramafic rocks (Fryer et al., 1985, 1990). Site 780 (19 ° 32. 5 'N, 146 ° 39. 2 'E) is located on the western side of Conical Seamount near the summit, at a depth of 3083. 4 mbsl. This area is only partly sediment covered and lies near active venting fields where chimney structures are forming (Fryer et al., 1990) ...|$|R
60|$|The apparatus, {{so far as}} it {{has been}} {{described}} with any detail, and ignoring what was said about an eye-hole, is little else than a modified copying-camera, by which an image of the transparency could be thrown on the ordinary focusing-screen, and be altered in scale and position until it was adjusted to fiducial lines drawn on the screen. It is conceivable that this should be done, and that the screen should be replaced by the dark slide, and a brief exposure given to the plate; then, that a fresh transparency should be inserted, a fresh focusing adjustment made, and a second exposure given, and so on. This, I say, is conceivable, but it would be very inconvenient. The adjusting screws would be out of reach; the head of the operator would be in an awkward position; and though these two difficulties might be overcome in some degree, a serious risk of an occasional shift of the plate during the frequent replacement of the dark slide would remain. I avoid all this by making my <b>adjustments</b> while the <b>plate</b> continues in position with its front open. I do so through the help of a reflector temporarily interposed between it and the lens. I do not use the ordinary focusing-screen at all in making my adjustments, but one that is flush, or nearly so, with the roof of the camera. When the reflector is interposed, the image is wholly cut off from the sensitised plate, and is thrown upwards against this focusing-screen, g. When the reflector is withdrawn, the image falls on the plate. It is upon this focusing-screen in the roof that I see the fiducial lines by which I make all the adjustments. Nothing can be more convenient than the position of this focusing-screen for working purposes. I look down on the image as I do upon a book resting on a sloping desk, and all the parts of the apparatus are within an easy arm's length.|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Modern {{recording}} of sea levels show that sea levels {{have been rising}} since the late 19 th century. Recently is has been argued by several authors that thermal expansion due to global warming is accelerating sea level rise. This report examines the impact that rising sea levels, combined with vertical land movement, {{will have on the}} coastal states of the conterminous United States. Three key indicators (land inundation, inhabitant displaced, and GDP impeded) are analyzed for three scenarios (ELT, GWC, and GWC+/+). The ELT scenario is the extended linear trend from historic sea level rise, the GWC scenario couples sea level rise to a high-end emission scenario, and the GWC+/+ scenario couples sea level rise to a high-end emission scenario and includes an uncertainty attribute and accelerated glacier and icecap melting. Due to the incorporation of vertical land movement, the relative sea level rise for each state could be assessed separately. Since the vertical land movement is distinctly different for each state, this approach offers a more accurate assessment of the impact than using a uniform sea level rise. It is found that natural processes like the Glacial Isostatic <b>Adjustment</b> and <b>plate</b> tectonics are the main determinants for relative sea level rise along the Atlantic and Pacific coast. Estimates for relative sea level rise on these coasts vary per state between 0. 1 - 0. 4 meters for the ELT scenario, 0. 4 - 1. 1 meters for the GWC scenario, and 1. 3 - 2. 5 meters for the GWC+/+ scenario. On the Gulf coast, oil extraction and groundwater withdrawal cause major human-induced subsidence, leading to high estimates for relative sea level rise. On the Gulf coast, estimated sea level rise varies for the different states between 0. 2 - 0. 8 meter, 0. 6 - 2. 5 meter, and 1. 6 - 4. 3 meter for respectively the ELT, GWC and GWC+/+ scenario. By use of a geographic information system (GIS), it is estimated that for the ELT scenario, a minimum of 30. 000 km 2 will be inundated, 1. 7 million people will be displaced, and 76 billion dollar of GDP production will be affected if no adaptive or mitigative action is taken. For the GWC and GWC+/+ scenario this is respectively 49. 000 km 2 and 76. 000 km 2 inundated, 3. 3 million and 7. 4 million inhabitants displaced, and 130 billion and 289 billion dollar of GDP production affected. Especially Louisiana and Florida, with low-lying terrain and major cities at the ocean front see a high absolute impact on population and GDP. Since these results are based on fairly slow inundation, it has to be realized that storm surges in combination with sea level rise can seriously increase these numbers. Furthermore, growth dynamics of population and GDP will increase the numbers even further. The results presented in this report can therefore be considered the absolute minimum impact of sea level rise under three scenarios for the conterminous United States if no adaptive and mitigative efforts are undertaken. Concerning the significant impact sea level rise has on coastal communities, it is evidently clear that action needs to be taken. This being said, population in coastal areas continues to grows, setting the stage for either great loss, or excessive protection costs. Anticipating on sea level rise and retreating from areas at risk will greatly reduce the impact and cost of sea level rise. An optimum mix of adaptive strategies needs to be defined for each specific region depending on environmental, geophysical and socio-economic conditions. For highly developed regions it might be beneficial to protect rather than retreat. The economic value that is protected would far outweigh the cost of protection. For less developed regions, the smart option would be to accommodate and retreat since the value of protected property does not justify the cost of protection. The most sustainable strategy for future development is retreat, avoiding additional cost all together. To stop sea levels from rising, mitigative actions need to be undertaken. Due to slow mixing of warm ocean surface layers with deeper ocean layer sea levels will continue to rise by thermal expansion even after greenhouse gas emissions have been stabilized. If no mitigative action is taken today, we will pass an increasing problem on to next generations leaving the world with the legacy of excessive consumption and pollution. ...|$|R
