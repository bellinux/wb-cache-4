40|$|Abstract: In Romania, {{suckling}} {{lamb meat}} is on demand during the Easter, but growing suckling lambs just {{for this purpose}} is not profitable. The paper performed a comparative study of the fattening aptitudes of the lambs from three local sheep breeds to produce carcasses demanded on the international market. The research was done on three groups (Carabash, Tsigai and Tsurcana breeds) of 16 weaned lambs each, with an initial weight between 21 - 27 kg and continued until the animals reached an weight of 35 - 38 kg. The experiment started {{after a period of}} accommodation to the experimental maintenance and feeding conditions. The animals were kept indoors under similar conditions of feeding and microclimate. The body weight of the animals was measured {{at the beginning and end}} of each fattening period, as well as the average daily gain and the total weight gain for each breed. During the late period of fattening, control weighing was performed until the target weight has been achieved. The Carabash lambs, which had the highest lambing weights of all the investigated breeds, proved to be the most precocious as weight gain. Over 44 fattening days they recorded an average daily gain of 0. 258 ± 0. 016 kg, reaching a <b>slaughtering</b> <b>weight</b> of 38. 46 ± 1. 178 kg with a feed conversion ratio of 4. 66 FU. The Tsigai lambs, less precocious than the Carabash lambs, recorded an average daily gain of 0. 191 ± 0. 043 kg, over 86 days 86, reaching a <b>slaughtering</b> <b>weight</b> of 37. 16 ± 0. 130 kg, with a significantly higher feed conversion ratio, of 6. 35 FU. The Tsurcana lambs, on the bottom position as fattening aptitudes, reached and average daily weight of 0. 154 ± 0. 0142 kg over 91 days, reaching a <b>slaughtering</b> <b>weight</b> of 35. 25 ± 1. 445 kg with a feed conversion ratio of 6. 44 FU.

In {{order to}} {{establish}} the fattening aptitudes of male Norwegian White x Turcana hybrid young sheep compared to Turcana young sheep, fattening trial was developed during 79 days. Twelve hybrid and twelve Turcana young male sheep were used, and 5 heads of those were slaughtered {{in the end of}} the fattening time interval. During the fattening trial, both breed structures were maintained in the same conditions, and received the same food. The differences between the average values recorded in Norwegian White x Turcana male young sheep hybrids and Turcana male young sheep are positive and statistically assured at different significance thresholds for the weight in the end of the fattening time interval (+ 4. 63 kg), total gain (+ 2. 29 kg) and average daily gain (+ 29. 42 g), <b>slaughtering</b> <b>weight</b> (+ 5. 56 kg) and warm carcass weight (+ 4. 26 kg) ...|$|E
40|$|Objective of this {{research}} was to establish carcass composition in Turopolje pig breed by analyzing the percentage of muscle (M), fat (F) and bone (B) tissue, percentage of these tissues in different parts of carcass (ham, loin, back, neck, belly-rib part. BRP), as well as share of the parts in carcass. Animals were divided into two groups of different age and <b>slaughtering</b> <b>weight</b> (TI 584 ± 20 days and 81, 9 kg; TII 679 ± 20 days and 100, 3 kg ± 4, 9 kg). Purpose of this investigation was to define the standards for traits mentioned {{for the remainder of the}} population of Turopolje pig and to set the selection and production programs, as this breed has been under protection since 1993 and re-establishment since 1996 as cultural and biological heritage of Croatia and the World. In order to define Turopolje pig in production sense, we presented characteristics of the old breeds Mongolitza and Black Slavonian and some selected breeds. Pigs were fattened in the outdoor system of flood forests and marsh meadows biocenosis (Quercus robur. Deschampsietum caespitosae), according to traditional Croatian technology of low input (Ðikić et al., 2002). <b>Slaughtering</b> <b>weight</b> and weight of warm and cold carcass were measured on the slaughtering line. The halves were separately weight and dissected (tissues and parts) according to Weninger et al., 1963 and by total dissection. Data were processed by statistical-mathematical procedure GSM and SAS software package (1996) and results were compared within and between the groups (t-test). In groups TI and TII the percentages tissues in carcass were established to be as follows: M 38. 2 % and 40. 5 %, B 10. 6 % and 9. 7 %, respectively, and were significantly different (P< 0. 05), while share of F, 34. 2 % and 33. 8 % were not significantly different. Fattened pigs in group TI, in relation to TII, had lower relative share of muscle tissue in the carcass of loin, back, neck and BRP and higher share of fat tissue of neck and BRP, as well as bone tissue of leg and loin.

40|$|The Romanian meat sector holds a {{significant}} share in agriculture; {{in the year}} 2007 its value represented 16. 1 % of total agricultural output and 41. 8 % of animal production. In {{the first year after}} Romania’s accession to the European Union, an obvious increase of total meat production by 12. 3 % compared to the year 2006 was noticed, due to {{the increase in the number}} of slaughtered animals in all species and of the <b>slaughtering</b> <b>weight,</b> mainly in the case of specialized industrial units. This positive trend also benefited from support from the state budget received for meat quality, for the classified pork and beef carcass, subsidies for the slaughtered chicks, as well as from direct payments for the bovine, sheep and goat farms. The domestic meat supply remained deficient, although production increased; yet it is worth mentioning that in the year 2007 the consumption coverage by domestic production represented 75. 9 % compared to 66. 5 % in 2006. The meat consumption per capita was at the same level as in 2006, i. e. 64. 7 kg. Meat imports in 2007 totalled 338. 5 thousand tons, down by 22. 1 % compared to 2006.

The aim of this experiment was to study retention rate and functionality of electronic identification systems in pigs, injected in different sites, to evaluate traceability of animals and highlight histopathological alterations of tissues in different inoculation sites. A total of 60 crossbred piglets were used to compare different transponder inoculation sites. One group (15 piglets) was identified only by plastic ear tags; and three groups were identified by passive injectable transponders (PIT) with different inoculation sites. Pigs were slaughtered in two different moments, in order to evaluate injection sites, macroscopically and histologically, either 50 days after injection or at a normal <b>slaughtering</b> <b>weight.</b> In general, no apparent animal health problems were observed {{the day after the}} injection or during the control readings performed during the experiment. Intraperitoneal localization gave excellent results in term of readability until the slaughter time. Transponders at the slaughter line were always recovered in the viscera tray because they were found loose in the peritoneal cavity. In some cases, they were found on the carcasses, attached to the peritoneum. In those cases a sample of peritoneal tissue was collected for histological examination. A reparative chronic reaction with moderate and multifocal fibrosis and neoformed vessels associated to multifocal and mild lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate were detected. In one case (6. 7 %) the transponder was found on the visceral side of the liver and the histological examination highlighted a localized superficial hepatic atrophy by compression. Retroauricolar site of injection gave lower readability results because 2 transponders (13. 3 %) were no more readable during the first month after injection. No lesions were found with this inoculation site. PIT injected in the perineal region were operative until slaughter time. Recovery procedures at the slaughter house were simple for animals slaughtered at a low weight, but much more difficult in the case of heavy pigs.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} with young male New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits to establish live body weight changes, body measurements, body composition and sexual maturity {{as a function of}} feeding intensity. Animals in Group 1 ('AL', n = 10) were fed ad libitum, while those in Group 2 ('RS', n = 10) received restricted feeding corresponding to 70 % of the ad libitum level. The starting liveweights were practically the same (0. 907 ± 0. 146 and 0. 911 ± 0. 147 kg in Group AL and Group RS, respectively). The feeding trial lasted from 6 to 22 weeks of age. The average body weight was significantly higher in Group AL from 7 to 22 weeks of age. At 22 weeks of age the body weight of RS rabbits was 85. 64 % of the weight of AL animals (3. 22 ± 0. 52 kg and 3. 76 ± 0. 33 kg, respectively). Average body weights of RS males at 8, 9, 11, 19 and 21 weeks of age were similar to those of ad libitum fed (AL) animals at 7, 8, 10, 15 and 16 weeks of age, respectively. The growth of bucks fed restricted tended to be allometric. The most significant difference was found at 16 and 18 weeks of age, while the lowest difference occurred at 6, 12, 15 and 19 weeks of age. It can be stated that low-intensity feeding up to <b>slaughtering</b> <b>weight</b> causes backwardness in rear cannon length and this backwardness remains also after the 15 th week, which is well over the optimal slaughtering age. Based on the present data, the 70 % restricted feeding cannot be recommended either for the future breeding bucks or for broiler males reared for slaughter. To determine the major chemical components of the body, rabbits were euthanised. Original dry matter and crude fat content of the body significantly (P < 0. 05) decreased under restricted feeding (41. 42 %; 32. 48 % and 16. 73 %; 7. 35 %) while the percentage of protein within the dry matter increased (49. 6 %; 65. 0 %) and fat decreased (40. 17 %; 22. 1 %) significantly.

O objetivo do trabalho foi avaliar o declínio do pH post-mortem, cor (CIE L*a*b*), perda de peso por cozimento (PPC) e força de cisalhamento (FC) nos músculos longissimus dorsi (LD) e semimembranosus (SM). Os parâmetros estudados foram submetidos à análise de regressão. O valor de pH para ambos os músculos foi expresso através de equações de regressão do tipo exponencial, apresentando uma rápida queda nas primeiras horas, seguido de estabilização. No músculo LD foi encontrado que a glicólise desenvolveu-se mais rapidamente com o aumento do peso. A análise dos componentes da cor para ambos os músculos estudados apresentaram o mesmo comportamento. A raça Bergamácia apresentou maior índice de luminosidade (L*), ou seja, maior brilho. O valor de L* diminuiu, o teor de vermelho (a*) aumentou e o teor de amarelo (b*) diminuiu linearmente em relação ao aumento do peso. A análise geral dos componentes da cor indicou que a carne de cordeiro é mais escura com o aumento do peso.
