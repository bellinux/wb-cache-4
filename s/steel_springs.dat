5|$|The cage {{crinoline}} {{made out}} of spring steel wire was first introduced in the 1850s, with the earliest British patent for a metal crinoline (described as a 'skeleton petticoat of <b>steel</b> <b>springs</b> fastened to tape.') granted in July 1856. Alison Gernsheim suggests that the unidentified French inventor was probably R. C. Milliet of Besançon, as the July 1856 patent was filed by their British agent, C. Amet. Milliet had already patented a 'tournure de femme' in Paris on 24 April 1856 which was described as comprising 'elastic extensible circles joined together by vertical bands.' Following its introduction, the women's rights advocate Amelia Bloomer felt that her concerns about the hampering nature of multiple petticoats had been resolved, and dropped dress reform as an issue. Diana de Marly, in her biography of the couturier Charles Frederick Worth noted that by 1858 there existed steel factories catering solely to crinoline manufacturers, and shops that sold nothing else but crinolines. One {{of the most significant}} manufacturers of crinolines was that of Thomson & Co., founded by an American with branches across Europe and the United States. At the height of their success, up to four thousand crinolines were produced by Thomson's London factory in a day, whilst another plant in Saxony manufactured 9.5 million crinolines over a twelve-year period. In 1859 the New York factory, which employed about a thousand girls, used 300,000yards of steel wire every week to produce between three and four thousand crinolines per day, while the rival Douglas & Sherwood factory in Manhattan used a ton of steel each week in manufacturing hoop skirts.|$|E

2500|$|After the {{disastrous}} {{failure of the}} mid-June convoys, it was wondered if Malta could hold out on the meagre supplies rescued from [...] "Harpoon" [...] and [...] "Vigorous" [...] until another convoy could be organised. Escorting merchant ships in the brilliance of a Mediterranean moonlit period was courting inevitable disaster. This situation limited operations {{in the immediate future}} to the moonless period in July or August between the 10th and 16th of those months. July passed as the Ohio could not be fitted-out in time. Once the due planning had been carried out it was decided to begin the operation in August. Ohio steamed down to Dunglass on the Clyde and loaded 11,500 tons of kerosene and diesel fuel oils. She was the only ship carrying these supplies which were so vital to Malta's survival. Before she sailed special strengthening was given to the tanker to protect her against the shock of bombs exploding near her. In the previous convoy, the tanker Kentucky had been sunk with only a few hours' repair work needed on a steam pipe, which had been broken by the force of such explosions. The Ministry was determined that this should not happen again, and so Ohios engines were mounted on rubber bearings, to reduce shock, and all steam pipes were supported with <b>steel</b> <b>springs</b> and baulks of timber. While the merchant ships were gathering in the Clyde Estuary, the naval forces had already reached Scapa Flow. Admiral Syfret joined [...] there on 27 July and held a convoy conference on 2 August; the same day, all leave had been stopped. At eight o'clock that evening, two hours before dusk, the convoy sailed. The fourteen ships, led by [...] formed up, it was dark {{by the time they reached}} the open sea.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{static and}} fatigue analysis of <b>steel</b> leaf <b>spring</b> and composite multi leaf spring {{made up of}} glass fibre reinforced polymer using life data analysis. The dimensions of an existing conventional <b>steel</b> leaf <b>spring</b> of a light commercial vehicle are taken and are verified by design calculations. Static analysis of 2 -D model of conventional leaf spring is also performed using ANSYS 7. 1 and compared with experimental results. Same dimensions of conventional leaf spring are used to fabricate a composite multi leaf spring using E-glass/Epoxy unidirectional laminates. The load carrying capacity, stiffness and weight of composite leaf spring are {{compared with that of}} <b>steel</b> leaf <b>spring</b> analytically and experimentally. The design constraints are stresses and deflections. Finite element analysis with full bump load on 3 -D model of composite multi leaf spring is done using ANSYS 7. 1 and the analytical results are compared with experimental results. Fatigue life of <b>steel</b> leaf <b>spring</b> and composite leaf is also predicted. Compared to <b>steel</b> <b>spring,</b> the composite leaf spring is found to have 67. 35 % lesser stress, 64. 95 % higher stiffness and 126. 98 % higher natural frequency than that of existing <b>steel</b> leaf <b>spring.</b> A weight reduction of 68. 15 % is also achieved by using composite leaf spring. It is also concluded that fatigue life of composite is more than that of conventional <b>steel</b> leaf <b>spring...</b>|$|R

60|$|The {{captain of}} the Adamant, pallid with fury, stood upon the poop. In a moment the crabs would be at his rudder! The great gun, double-shotted and ready to fire, was hanging from its boom over the stern. Crab K, whose roof had the {{additional}} protection of spring armour, now moved round {{so as to be}} directly astern of the Adamant. Before she could reach the rudder, her forward part came under the suspended cannon, and two massive steel shot were driven down upon her with a force sufficient to send them through masses of solid rock; but from the surface of elastic <b>steel</b> <b>springs</b> and air-buffers they bounced upward, one of them almost falling {{on the deck of the}} Adamant.|$|E

They felt the fog melt away and found themselves bathed in glorious rays of sunshine, but they had no time to consider this change because they were still shooting through the air, and presently--before they could think of anything at all--all three were rolling heels over head on the soft grass of a meadow.|$|E
60|$|What {{impressed}} me particularly was the mental and muscular superiority {{of these two}} officers.

They were iron. They were perceivers, willers, and doers. They were as of another species compared with the sailors under them. While the latter, witnesses of the happening and directly on the spot, had been crying out in befuddled helplessness, and with slow wits and slower bodies been climbing upon the rail, the second mate had descended the steep ladder from the poop, covered two hundred feet of deck, sprung upon the rail, grasped the instant need of the situation, and cast the coil of line into the water.|$|E

2500|$|As in a coil-spring {{suspension}} design, the FRP mono-leaf {{spring supports}} {{the weight of}} the vehicle. However, the FRP leaf <b>springs</b> differ from <b>steel</b> coils and traditional <b>steel</b> multi-leaf <b>springs</b> in a number of significant ways. The FRP plastic springs have 4.3–5.5 times the strain energy storage per weight, compared to steel. This results in a lighter spring for a given application. The single FRP mono-leaf front spring used on the fourth-generation Corvette is 33percent of the weight of an equivalent set of coil springs. Comparing FRP to conventional <b>steel</b> leaf <b>springs</b> in similar applications, the weight saved is even greater. The third-generation Corvette offered an optional FRP mono-leaf spring {{as an alternative to the}} standard multi-leaf <b>steel</b> <b>spring,</b> the [...] <b>steel</b> <b>spring</b> being replaced by a [...] FRP spring. Volvo claims a weight savings of [...] by using a FRP spring in the rear suspension of its second-generation XC90, compared to designs using coil springs. In addition to the reduction in vehicle weight, {{the weight of the}} spring is partly unsprung mass.|$|R

But at the first motion (I had stood at first like an old stump on the ridge) a fawn that had evidently been watching {{me all the time}} from his hiding sprang into sight with a sharp whistle of warning. The doe threw up her head, looking straight at me as if she had understood more from the signal than I had thought possible. There was not an instant's hesitation or searching.

60|$|When the {{sun rose}} that morning one who stood on the high ridge of the Top Gallants, far to the eastward of Harbor Weal, would have seen seven trails winding down among the rocks and thickets. It needed only a glance {{to show that the}} seven trails, each one as {{clear-cut}} and delicate as that of a prowling fox, were the records of wolves' cautious feet; and that they were no longer beating the thickets for grouse and rabbits, but moving swiftly all together for the edges of the vast barrens where the caribou herds were feeding. Another glance--but here we must have the cunning eyes of Old Tomah the hunter--would have told that two of the trails were those of enormous wolves which led the pack; two others were plainly cubs that had not yet lost the cub trick of frolicking in the soft snow; while three others were just wolves, big and powerful brutes that moved as if on <b>steel</b> <b>springs,</b> and that still held to the old pack because the time had not yet come for them to scatter finally to their separate ways and head new packs of their own in the great solitudes.|$|E
60|$|The {{body of the}} monster, {{protruding}} {{opposite the}} steps almost at a right angle from the wall, was moved in all directions by <b>steel</b> <b>springs,</b> which communicated {{with one of the}} lower stairs, and also with a sword placed in the throat of the image to represent the dragon's tongue. The walls around the steps narrowed so as barely to admit the passage of the human body when they approached the dragon. At the slightest pressure on the stair with which the spring communicated, the body of the monster bent forward, and the sword instantly protruded from its throat, at such a height from the steps as ensure that it should transfix in a vital part the person who descended. The corpse, then dropping by its own weight off the sword, fell through a tunnelled opening beneath the dragon, running downward in an opposite direction to that taken by the steps above, and was deposited on an iron grating washed by the waters of the Tiber, which ran under the arched foundations of the temple. The grating was approached by a secret subterranean passage leading {{from the front of the}} building, by which the sacrificing priests were enabled to reach the dead body, to fasten weights to it, and opening the grating, to drop it into the river, never to be beheld again by mortal eyes.|$|E
