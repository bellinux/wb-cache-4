2500|$|A {{central theme}} in Catherine Doherty's spirituality is [...] "the {{duty of the}} moment". As she herself put it:The duty of the moment is what you should be doing at any given time, in {{whatever}} place God has put you. You may not have Christ in a homeless person at your door, but {{you may have a}} little child. If you have a child, your duty of the moment may be to change a dirty diaper. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it. But you don't just change that diaper, you change it {{to the best of your}} ability, with great love for both God and that child.... There are all kinds of good Catholic things you can do, but whatever they are, you have to realize that there is always the duty of the moment to be done. And it must be done, because the duty of the moment is the duty of God.|$|E

2500|$|On 30 June 2009, it {{was officially}} {{announced}} to the media that the Government of Singapore was planning to create the Special Operations Task Force to counter all terrorist threats from land, sea and air. According to Teo Chee Hean, Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence at that time, he stated that the unit's establishment was needed because Singapore is not [...] "dealing only with people with guns. They may be dealing {{with people who have}} very powerful explosives and various kinds of other substances, chemical, radiological and so on, so you need to develop capabilities to deal with these things. You have to deal with them at sea, at shore, buildings, aeroplanes, ships, coastlines and so on, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> need to bring together these capabilities, develop them in a much more complete, coherent and integrated way." [...] In addition, Colonel Lam commented on the 2008 Mumbai attacks [...] "where terrorists are getting smarter as well.
