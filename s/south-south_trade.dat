The latest liberalization of GATT gave rise to new increases, this time in <b>South–South</b> agricultural <b>trade.</b> Secondly, income demand elasticity for imports has a negative sign for agricultural products from the Southern countries; this demonstrates that such products behaved like inferior goods and that for this reason these countries suffered a brake on the growth of their exports.|$|R

40|$|The {{tremendous}} {{growth of}} <b>South-South</b> <b>trade</b> {{is among the}} key trends in international economics, yet it has received surprisingly little attention from scholars of international political economy. This dissertation helps to fill this void by providing the first systematic analysis of the political effects of <b>South-South</b> <b>trade.</b> Such analysis is appropriate given the foreign policy norm that uniquely characterizes South-South relations, including South-South trade: countries of the South espouse the practice of non-interference in the domestic affairs of their partners. In contrast, countries of the North typically seek to promote certain domestic policies among their partners in the Global South, such as human rights, democratic governance, certain foreign policy behaviors, and labor and environmental standards. In light of Southern non-interference and its contrast to the foreign policy norms of countries of the North, this dissertation assesses the effects of <b>South-South</b> <b>trade</b> on trade-based diffusion processes associated with labor laws, environmental standards, and voting within international organizations. In assessing each of these policy areas, the analysis considers three issues: first, whether the policy diffusion patterns associated with South-South {{are different from those}} associated with other types of trade flows; second, whether high levels of <b>South-South</b> <b>trade</b> weaken the effectiveness of trade-based policy promotion efforts by countries of the North; and third, whether variation in <b>South-South</b> <b>trade</b> levels moderates the relationships between domestic political variables and policy outcomes. These hypotheses correspond to a novel theory positing that trade-based efforts by Northern countries to promote the adoption of their favored policies by partners in the South are weaker where those Southern partners engage in high levels of <b>South-South</b> <b>trade.</b> In Southern countries where Northern efforts are rendered weak by high levels of <b>South-South</b> <b>trade,</b> it is further theorized that domestic level interests and institutions play a larger role in the policy process, as these interests and institutions are less constrained by interference from the North and not subject to comparable interference efforts from the South. The results provide mixed support for this theory, but they do clarify that <b>South-South</b> <b>trade</b> is accompanied by different policy diffusion patterns than other types of trade...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{patterns and}} determinants of trade among developing countries (<b>South-South</b> <b>trade),</b> {{with emphasis on}} the role of production sharing in global economic integration of the Southern economies. It begins with an analytical narrative of the emerging trends and patterns of <b>South-South</b> <b>trade</b> using a classification system that helps delineating trade based on global production sharing (network trade) from total recorded trade. Then it undertakes a comparative econometric analysis of the determinants of South-South and South-North trade using the standard gravity model. There is evidence that the share of <b>South-South</b> <b>trade</b> in world trade has increased significantly over the past two decades. However, this increase has predominantly come from the dynamic East Asian countries, reflecting their growing engagement in global production sharing.

40|$|The recent global {{economic}} crisis which {{originated in the}} global North but quickly spread to the global South has {{raised questions about the}} desirability and viability of export regimes primarily orientated towards the markets of high-income countries. The experience of crisis and contagion made developing countries intensify their efforts to diversify sources of economic growth and their search for alternative models of economic development. Expanding <b>South-South</b> <b>trade</b> relationships increasingly became viewed as one such alternative. Yet how promising a strategy is this? In an attempt to provide an answer to this question, this paper first documents the dynamic evolution of <b>South-South</b> <b>trade</b> in past decades and puts forward some theoretical considerations. It then undertakes an econometric analysis to estimate income elasticities of import demand for bilateral trade relationships among a sample of developing Asian and South American countries and two key Northern markets, the Eurozone and the US. Applying an ARDL approach to estimation, our econometric analysis yields mixed results with regard to the question whether <b>South-South</b> <b>trade</b> is generally characterized by higher income elasticities of import demand than South-North trade. While this is largely true for trade involving developing Asian economies, the same does not hold for South American countries. Moreover, income elasticities for imports from the global South are comparatively high in the US (and actually higher than for <b>South-South</b> <b>trade</b> flows in many cases) but this does not equally apply for the Eurozone. Still, our findings show that <b>South-South</b> <b>trade</b> can be a promising alternative source of economic growth, especially if South-North income growth and import growth differentials in favor of the former continue to persist. These findings, thus, provide a rationale for policies aimed at facilitating trade among developing countries. ...|$|E

In a repeated game framework, {{we show that}} trade preferences granted are positively related to preferences received and to the trade partner’s market size.

We use detailed trade, tariff, and income data for countries involved in 79 trade agreements negotiated since 1980 to test for reciprocity. The results offer strong evidence of reciprocity in North-North and <b>South-South</b> free <b>trade</b> agreements, but there is little empirical support for reciprocity in North-South trade agreements. We also find evidence that large countries extract greater trade concessions from small countries.

The reduction in the volume of imports from non-CIS countries equal to USD 1. 1 bn (8 % of Belarusian non-CIS import in 2008) will be mainly brought about by cancellation of used cars imports from non-member countries. The analyses revealed that Belarusian budget can benefit from participation in the Customs Union (CU). The amount of possible gain will be about 28. 3 % of total budget revenues from customs duties and customs charges in 2008 {{due to the fact that}} approximately 40 % of Russian imports may go through customs clearance in Belarus owning to less bureaucracy at the border with respect to Russia, and the revenues from customs charges, which is not planned to be distributed among member countries, will be transferred to Belarusian budget.

To export hairs, clothes, or electronic goods transported in their suitcases, they mobilize competences and skills that can be understood as a "reversal" of power relationships. This capacity of (re) negociation leads to the feminization of the informal economy while it underlines the rise of women's successful trajectories in the suitcase trade.

40|$|Abstract: This article reassesses the trade–development nexus in {{international}} economic law and provides the first examination of the approach to realize the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals through regional integration. It argues that the emerging New Regional Economic Order in the multipolar system will fortify the coalition of developing countries in structuring the legalization of pro-development trade policy. For decades, the misconceived concept of special and differential treatment has ignored {{the reality of the}} North–South Grand Bargain and disconnected the World Trade Organization from its development objectives. The development crisis of the Doha Round requires a feasible “Plan B” for the Global South. By making interrelated theoretical and substantive claims, this article opens an inquiry into the assertive role of developing countries that prompted the paradigm shift in Asia–Pacific regionalism. The realist and dependency theories are utilized to decipher the geopolitical complexity of the rapidly evolving <b>South–South</b> free <b>trade</b> agreements. As a timely case study, the analysis is based on the creation of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Economic Community and its implications for economic powers such as the United States and China. It provides an account of the bloc’s services trade-oriented development policy under the balance of power strategy. Finally, this article offers regulatory reform proposals on how to integrate development assistance and remove trade barriers. Transnational legal harmonization and human rights protection in line with international labor principles are also indispensable. Such reforms will strengthen the best practices for global regionalism and reinvigorate the trade–development connection in the multilateral trading system...|$|R
