Although they progress through the stages in the same order, individuals in different cultures <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so at different rates. Kohlberg has responded by saying that although different cultures do indeed inculcate different beliefs, his stages correspond to underlying modes of reasoning, rather than to those beliefs.|$|E

25|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of insects}} {{that live in}} colonies, such as ants, bees, wasps and termites, {{has always been a}} source of fascination for children, naturalists and artists. Individual insects <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> their own thing without any central control, yet the colony as a whole behaves in a highly coordinated manner. Researchers have found that cooperation at the colony level is largely self-organized. The group coordination that emerges is often just a consequence of the way individuals in the colony interact. These interactions can be remarkably simple, such as one ant merely following the trail left by another ant. Yet put together, the cumulative effect of such behaviours can solve highly complex problems, such as locating the shortest route in a network of possible paths to a food source. The organised behaviour that emerges in this way is sometimes called swarm intelligence.|$|E

It can be leggy in shadier positions, or a more compact bushy shrub in full sun. Some varieties from drier areas <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> poorly in areas of summer humidity.

Some Banksia marginata seed of subalpine provenance require stratification, namely keeping at [...] for 60 days before germination takes place over 6 to 25 days. Salkin proposed this was necessary so that seed released in a summer or autumn bushfire would lie dormant over the winter months before germinating in the spring. Banksia saxicola and [...] Banksia canei seed also share this trait.|$|E

About GHV2, New Strait Times Christie Leo commented that [...] "this second volume of {{greatest}} hits isn't as immediately accessible as the first. But that's not what this collection is all about. This 14-track set actually provides a more daring glimpse into the inner machinations of the music marketing juggernaut, Madonna". AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave a mixed review calling it [...] "slightly disappointing", justifying {{that it was because}} during the 1990s, Madonna was an album artist. He finished his review saying that [...] "the end result is less {{than the sum of its}} parts, even if this is a good way to get all of Madge's 90s hits at once." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented that [...] "GHV2 certainly encapsulates the second decade of the performer's boundary-bridging career", but criticized the lack of new material, and its [...] "choppy edits, random sequences and missing links", saying: [...] "the collection doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> justice to a career that has always been ahead of the game and focused on the future". Charlotte Robinson from PopMatters criticized its sequencing, stating, [...] "Chronological sequencing would have made it easier to follow the course of Madonna's musical evolution. But would these changes have made GHV2 a significantly better album? Probably not. As it stands, it's the best summary of Madonna's second decade as a performer we're going to get." ...|$|E
500|$|Community {{leaders in}} Lansing have {{proposed}} renaming {{a section of}} Grand River Avenue in Old Town Lansing for César Chávez, the Mexican-American civil rights activist. The group [...] "Lansing for Cesar E. Chavez" [...] was raising funds to rename the section between Oakland and Pine streets in Old Town. Previously, a section of Grand Avenue was renamed for Chávez in 1994, but the voters overturned the decision. The renaming proposal was even mentioned {{as a way to}} untangle a maze of different branches of Grand River Avenue running through Old Town. Currently, East Grand River Avenue and North Grand River Avenue bridge between sections of Grand River Avenue, in addition to Grand Avenue which runs along the Grand River near downtown. While Lansing's Latino community supported the proposal, the business community opposed it. One shop owner said she would have $10,000 in costs associated with a name change, adding, [...] "I think there's many beautiful ways to honor such an incredible man. Changing five blocks of a street doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> justice." [...] Another business owner cited the work the Old Town Commercial Association has done to market the area using the Grand River Avenue name, marketing that would be useless after a name change. The compromise solution reached in August 2010 was to rename lot 56, where Old Town holds festivals, to Cesar Chavez Plaza. Street signs would be installed marking parts of Grand River Avenue as Cesar E. Chavez Avenue, but only in a memorial capacity; the street would still be officially named Grand River Avenue.|$|E

500|$|The general {{opinion of}} Fountain of the Great Lakes was {{positive}} with some describing it as a cultural achievement for Taft and Chicago. The detractors conceded that as a figural composition, it was ideal in an Old World way. [...] Critics voiced concern over the sculpture's confusion and decorum. [...] One of the basic problems for the critics was the propriety of the symbolism of artistic and attractive bronze figures posed as bodies of water. [...] There had for some time been discussion of the depictions representing relative elevations and the flows of the waters as they <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> There were grumblings for closer association of the figures to the lakes by use of physical features, directional orientation and definite contours. [...] Harriet Monroe, a general supporter of Taft's artistic efforts, was disappointed in the lack of representative geographic configuration {{and the lack of}} spirit of the lakes as inland seas. [...] With respect to this specific piece she had gone from being an ardent supporter who felt the model was [...] "stupendous" [...] to finding herself in [...] "doubt" [...] about the work. [...] Taft's human form depictions of the lake failed to capture the imagery of contemporary literature as it related to the power and fury of nature and the heroism of those struggling against those forces in works such as those of Hamlin Garland, Charles Eugene Banks, Willa Cather, or Robert Morss Lovett. [...] Taft's representations of Lakes with quiet trickling water was in keeping with his general theme of quiet dignity for public sculpture. [...] On the day of the dedication the Chicago Daily News expressed this point with a photomontage juxtaposition of Taft's fountain and Lake Michigan in all its fury.|$|E

2500|$|In the USA, from 1980 to 1992, Muti {{was music}} {{director}} of the Philadelphia Orchestra, which he led on numerous international tours. In 1979, he was appointed its music director and, in 1992, conductor laureate. Muti stated that his approach was to remain faithful to the intent of the composer. This meant a change from applying the lush [...] "Philadelphia Sound," [...] created by his predecessors Eugene Ormandy and Leopold Stokowski, to all repertoire; however, many of his recordings with that orchestra largely <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> away with its hallmark sound, even in the works of such composers as Tchaikovsky, Brahms, and other high romantics. His sonic changes to the orchestra remain controversial. Some felt he turned it into a generic-sounding institution with a lean sound much favored by modern recording engineers. Others believe Muti uncovered the true intention of the works, which had been covered in a silky sheen by Muti's predecessor. Since his departure from Philadelphia, he has made very few guest conducting appearances with the Philadelphia Orchestra, most recently in 2005.|$|E

2500|$|When snails {{are raised}} indoors under {{controlled}} conditions, reproduction {{varies according to}} the geographic origin of the breeding stock. For example, one researcher found that H. aspersa snails from Brittany <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> better indoors than snails from another region. To breed snails indoors, the temperature needs to be kept at 70°F and the relative humidity at 80% to 90%; some sources say 95%. Another source recommends 75% humidity by day and 95% at night. The Center for Heliciculture once recommended 65–75% humidity {{during the day and}} 85–95% at night at 68°F. In any event, avoid humidity higher than 95% (some say 90%) for any length of time. Excessive humidity can kill snails. Optimum temperature and relative humidity depend on several things, including the snail variety and even where breeding stock was gathered. For H. aspersa, the optimum temperature for hatching eggs seems to be [...] at 100% relative humidity. The second best temperature/humidity combination depends on where the snails came from and results can drop drastically to 0% hatching at [...] and 100% humidity. The soil must not be kept wet when the humidity is maintained at 100%, as the eggs will absorb water, swell up, and burst.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first of}} Portinaro's {{associations}} was an unnamed group he founded himself, which existed {{to further the}} musical careers of its members, which he created on 21 June 1555. [...] Upon the dissolution of this fraternity he moved to Vicenza, where he joined the Accademia dei Costanti in that city, a society of humanists to which he dedicated his 1557 book of madrigals. [...] In March 1557 {{he was back in}} Padua, for the newly formed Accademia degli Elevati. [...] Of this group, some records survive of its specific activities, and his role in them. [...] There were approximately forty members of the academy; unlike the original Accademia Filarmonica in Verona, the members themselves did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> most of the music-making. [...] Portinaro was hired as maestro, and he was to find professional assistants to perform for the academy members. [...] Their sessions, which involved lectures, speeches, and discussions about secular and Latin poetry and other humanistic topics, frequently began and ended with musical performances by Portinaro and his group. [...] In addition, Portinaro and his assistants, of which there were three listed in the records, were required by the terms of his employment to teach singing, instrumental performance, and other aspects of music to any of the members who wished it. [...] The organization did not survive long – in 1560 it dissolved, for reasons unknown. [...] Portinaro dedicated a book of madrigals for them that year.|$|E
