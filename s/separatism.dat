5|$|Separatyzm Żydów i jego źródła (<b>Separatism</b> of Jews and its Sources), 1909.|$|E
5|$|Around this time, {{tensions}} {{began to}} arise between what {{was perceived as}} president Núñez's dictatorial rule and the nationalistic support group, Boixos Nois. The group, identified with a left-wing <b>separatism,</b> repeatedly demanded the resignation of Núñez and openly defied him through chants and banners at matches. At the same time, Barcelona experienced an eruption in skinheads, who often identified with a right-wing <b>separatism.</b> The skinheads slowly transferred the Boixos Nois' ideology from liberalism to fascism, which caused division within the group and a sudden support for Núñez's presidency. Inspired by British hooligans, the remaining Boixos Nois became violent, causing havoc leading to large-scale arrests.|$|E
5|$|The new right-wing Front National (FN) party {{formed in}} December 2013 {{promotes}} <b>separatism</b> and Afrikaner self-determination. Hannes Engelbrecht is their leader and Dan Roodt is their deputy leader and spokesperson.|$|E
5|$|Both the NDH {{forces and}} Drljević had reasons for ensnaring Đurišić. The NDH forces were {{motivated}} by the mass terror committed by Đurišić on the Muslim population in Sandžak and south-eastern Bosnia. Drljević was opposed to Đurišić's support of a union of Serbia and Montenegro, which ran counter to Drljević's <b>separatism.</b>|$|E
5|$|On April 5, 2008, Bacar was remanded in custody. Comoran President Sambi visited Anjouan {{in early}} April, marking {{his first visit}} to the island since May 2007. He said that he hoped that <b>separatism</b> in Anjouan would cease with the removal of Bacar from power, and he praised the African leaders who had {{provided}} assistance for the invasion.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} {{arguments}} against polyethnicity, {{as well as}} the assimilation of ethnicities in polyethnic regions. Wilmot Robertson in The Ethnostate and Dennis L. Thomson in The Political Demands of Isolated Indian Bands in British Columbia, argue for some level of <b>separatism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cynesige, the {{archbishop}} of York, died on 22 December 1060, and Ealdred was elected Archbishop of York on Christmas Day, 1060. Although a bishop was promptly appointed to Hereford, none was named to Worcester, {{and it appears that}} Ealdred intended to retain Worcester along with York, which several of his predecessors had done. There were a few reasons for this, one of which was political, as the kings of England preferred to appoint bishops from the south to the northern bishoprics, hoping to counter the northern tendency towards <b>separatism.</b> Another reason was that York was not a wealthy see, and Worcester was. Holding Worcester along with York allowed {{the archbishop}} sufficient revenue to support himself.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} decade of the new millennium, {{president}} Joan Laporta, a supporter of Catalan nationalism, repeatedly expressed his support of Catalonia's secession from Spain and characterised the club as the symbol for Catalan <b>separatism.</b> The politicalisation of the club drew criticism from several club members who accused Laporta of alienating Barcelona fans, both within and outside of Catalunya. By 2003 Barcelona had 1,200 penyes around the world, causing other Spanish clubs to copy the concept. With each individual peña (Castillian Spanish spelling) having different names and rules, it has become a custom in Spain to name a new peña after their favourite player or match, and in turn the player usually attends to the inaugural supper.|$|E
5|$|In 1986–87, McNallen {{worked as}} a peace officer in Stephens County Texas sheriff's office jail and Sheila kept books for an oil company. In 1986, he and Sheila moved to a semi-deserted mining town in the {{mountains}} of California, and there he earned teaching credentials before teaching science and mathematics at a junior high school for six years. During his summer vacations he travelled abroad, during which he met with guerrilla groups active {{in various parts of the}} world, writing articles about them for magazines like Soldier of Fortune. He later related that this experience convinced him of the need for ethnonationalism and ethnic <b>separatism</b> across the world. McNallen also joined the U.S. National Guard and was called up during the 1992 Los Angeles riots.|$|E
5|$|The Smuts {{family lived}} in an almost {{exclusively}} Afrikaner world. Nevertheless, this cultural identity, unlike that of the Boer republics to the north, did not define itself on opposition to Britain or the British. Swartland farmers had been largely insulated from the causes of discontent of earlier years, discontent which eventually culminated in the mass Boer migrations of the Great Trek. As a result, Jacobus Smuts largely unmoved by the Afrikaner nationalism preached by such organisations as the Afrikaner Bond, founded by Rev. SJ du Toit in 1877. After 1884, having come {{under the leadership of}} Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr, the Bond became more to the Smuts' taste. Hofmeyr changed the fundamental basis of the organisation, from one preaching Afrikaner <b>separatism</b> to one which combined a pragmatic policy of economic protectionism for Cape farmers and their produce with a call for unity between the English and Dutch-speaking populations and cooperation with the Colonial authorities. As a member of the Cape legislature Jacobus Smuts pledged his support to Hofmeyr and the reformed Bond.|$|E
5|$|The Ustaše {{gathered}} {{them in a}} field alongside 5,000 other Chetnik {{prisoners and}} arranged for Drljević and his followers to select 150 Chetnik officers and non-combatant intellectuals for execution. Đurišić, Baćović, Vasić and Ostojić were amongst those selected. They {{and the others were}} loaded onto boats by the Ustaše and taken across the Sava River, where they were killed either in the Jasenovac concentration camp itself or in a nearby marsh. Both the NDH forces and Drljević had reasons for ensnaring Đurišić. The NDH forces were motivated by the mass terror committed by Đurišić on the Muslim population in Sandžak and southeastern Bosnia while Drljević was opposed to Đurišić's support of a union of Serbia and Montenegro which ran counter to Drljević's <b>separatism.</b> Left without a leader, the majority of Đurišić's men were integrated into Drljević's Montenegrin National Army and withdrew with him towards the Austrian border.|$|E
5|$|Following this {{defeat and}} the {{defection}} {{of one of}} his sub-units to Drljević, Đurišić was induced to negotiate directly with the leaders of the NDH forces about the further movement of his Chetniks towards Slovenia. However, this {{appears to have been a}} trap, as he was attacked and captured by them on his way to the meeting. According to Tomasevich, exactly what occurred after his capture is not clear, but Baćović, Đurišić, Vasić and Ostojić were subsequently killed, along with some Serbian Orthodox priests and others. According to some sources, on 20 April, Đurišić, Baćović, Vasić and Ostojić were taken to the Stara Gradiška prison, near Jasenovac. The Ustaše gathered them in a field alongside 5,000 other Chetnik prisoners and arranged for Drljević and his followers to select 150 Chetnik officers and non-combatant intellectuals for execution. Đurišić, Baćović, Vasić and Ostojić were amongst those selected. They and the others were loaded onto boats by the Ustaše and taken across the Sava River, never to be seen again. It is reported that they were killed either in the Jasenovac concentration camp itself, or in a marsh in its vicinity. The website of the Jasenovac Memorial Site lists Baćović as having been killed at the camp by the Ustaše in 1945. Both the NDH forces and Drljević had reasons for ensnaring Đurišić. The NDH forces were motivated by the mass terror committed by Đurišić on the Muslim population in Sandžak and southeastern Bosnia while Drljević was opposed to Đurišić's support of a union of Serbia and Montenegro which ran counter to Drljević's <b>separatism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following this {{defeat and}} the {{defection}} {{of one of}} their sub-units to Drljević, Đurišić was induced to negotiate directly with the leaders of the HOS forces about the further movement of the Chetniks towards the Ljubljana Gap. However, this {{appears to have been a}} trap, as he was attacked and captured by them on his way to the meeting. According to the historian Professor Jozo Tomasevich, exactly what occurred after his capture is not clear, but Baćović, Đurišić, Vasić, Ostojić were subsequently killed, along with some Serbian Orthodox priests and others.

The NDH forces were motivated by the mass terror committed by Đurišić on the Muslim population in Sandžak and southeastern Bosnia while Drljević was opposed to Đurišić's support of a union of Serbia and Montenegro which ran counter to Drljević's <b>separatism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lesbian <b>separatism</b> {{is a form}} of separatist {{feminism}} {{specific to}} lesbians. <b>Separatism</b> has been considered by lesbians as both a temporary strategy and as a lifelong practice. Many lesbian separatists bought land so they could live separately from men and heterosexual women.|$|E
25|$|In lesbian feminist Marilyn Frye's (1978) essay Notes on <b>Separatism</b> and Power she posits female <b>separatism</b> as a {{strategy}} practiced by all women, at some point, and present in many feminist projects (one might cite women's refuges, electoral quotas or Women's Studies programmes). She argues {{that it is only}} when women practice it, self-consciously as separation from men, that it is treated with controversy (or as she suggests hysteria). Male <b>separatism</b> on the other hand (one might cite gentleman's clubs, labor unions, sports teams, the military and, more arguably, decision-making positions in general) is seen as quite a normal, even expedient phenomenon.|$|E

25|$|Lesbian <b>separatism</b> {{became popular}} in the 1970s as some lesbians doubted whether {{mainstream}} society or even the LGBT movement had anything to offer them.|$|E
25|$|Feminist Sonia Johnson, while {{advocating a}} broadly separatist policy, {{points out that}} feminist <b>separatism</b> risks {{defining}} itself by what it separates itself from, i.e. men.|$|E
25|$|As an Indian nationalist, Thevar {{condemned}} the Dravidar Kazhagam its successor DMK for stimulating <b>separatism</b> and parochialism. Moreover, he distrusted the Atheist {{element of the}} Dravidian political discourse.|$|E
25|$|The American radical feminist group Redstockings were {{strongly}} opposed to lesbian <b>separatism,</b> seeing interpersonal relationships with men {{as an important}} arena of feminist struggle, and hence seeing <b>separatism</b> as escapist. Like many radical feminists of the time, Redstockings saw lesbianism primarily as a political identity rather than a fundamental part of personal identity, and therefore analyzed it primarily in political terms. Redstockings were also opposed to male homosexuality, which they saw as a deeply misogynistic rejection of women. Redstockings' line on {{gay men and lesbians}} is often criticized as homophobic.|$|E
25|$|Left-wing nationalists have {{historically}} led the <b>separatism</b> and autonomist {{movements in the}} Basque Country (Basque nationalism), Catalonia (Catalan independence), Galicia (Galician nationalism), Poland and Sardinia (Sardinian nationalism).|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} of Lesbian <b>separatism</b> sometimes incorporates concepts related to queer nationalism and political lesbianism. Some individuals who identify as Lesbian separatists are {{also associated with}} the {{practice of}} Dianic paganism.|$|E

25|$|In 1963, separatist Zunun Taipov {{was given}} {{military}} advice by the Soviets. The Voice of East Turkestan (Šärqiy Türkistan awazi), a newspaper promoting Uyghur <b>separatism,</b> {{was published by}} Yusupbäk Mukhlisi with Soviet support in 1979.|$|E
25|$|Milošević {{emerged in}} 1987 {{as a force}} in Serbian {{politics}} after he declared support for Serbs in Kosovo, who claimed they were being oppressed {{by the government of}} the Serbian autonomous province of Kosovo, which was dominated by Kosovo's majority nationality, ethnic Albanians. Milošević claimed that Albanian authorities had abused their powers, that the autonomy of Kosovo was allowing the entrenchment of <b>separatism</b> in Kosovo, and that the rights of the minority Serbs in Kosovo were being regularly violated. As a solution, he called for political change to reduce the autonomy of Kosovo, protect minority Serb rights, and initiate a strong crackdown on <b>separatism</b> in Kosovo.|$|E
25|$|As a {{cultural}} artifact, The Turner Diaries is political fiction that presents {{the means by}} which white nationalism (white <b>separatism,</b> eugenics, etc.) can be established with a race war against the perceived non-white enemies of the nation.|$|E
25|$|Because Milošević's {{supporters}} controlled half of {{the votes}} in the SFRY presidency, his critics charge that he undermined the Yugoslav federation. This, his detractors argue, upset {{the balance of power}} in Yugoslavia and provoked <b>separatism</b> elsewhere in the federation.|$|E
25|$|The radical lesbian {{movement}} is a francophone lesbian movement roughly analogous to English-language lesbian <b>separatism.</b> Inspired by {{the writings of}} philosopher Monique Wittig, the movement originated in France in the early 1980s, spreading soon after to the Canadian province of Quebec.|$|E
25|$|Lesbian <b>separatism</b> and Separatist Feminism have {{inspired}} {{the creation of}} art and culture reflective of its visions of female-centered societies, including various works of lesbian science fiction where new technologies in human reproductive strategy have created Lesbian utopias, eliminating {{the need to have}} men for human reproduction.|$|E
25|$|Political {{lesbianism}} is {{a phenomenon}} within lesbian feminism and radical feminism, primarily second-wave feminism; it includes, but is not limited to, lesbian <b>separatism.</b> Political lesbianism embraces the theory that sexual orientation is a choice, and advocates lesbianism as a positive alternative to heterosexuality for women.|$|E
25|$|Quebec nationalism, by now popularly termed Quebec <b>separatism,</b> {{began to}} gain {{momentum}} in the late 1960s as a vocal minority began to push to bring the movement into the mainstream.

25|$|The Question of <b>Separatism</b> {{incorporated}} {{and expanded}} Jacobs’ {{presentation of the}} 1979 Massey Lectures, entitled Canadian Cities and Sovereignty-Association. It was published in 1980 and reprinted in 2011 with a previously-unpublished 2005 interview with Robin Philpot on the subject in which she evokes the relative overlooking of that book among her usual readership. This {{was in fact the}} first time she was requested to discuss it in an interview. Columnist Richard Gwyn advanced that while not openly criticizing her, English-speaking Canadians readers thought she did not understood how Canadian politics worked and that she was not being helpful in a time of distress for national unity (the 1980 referendum was just defeated by a vote of 60%). The Question of <b>Separatism</b> was also not mentioned in the bibliography of her 2006 obituary in The Globe and Mail.|$|E
25|$|Milošević's {{supporters}} {{contend that}} {{the representatives of the}} SFRY presidency were elected according to the law. They say that Milošević enjoyed genuine popular support so it was perfectly logical for his allies to be elected to the presidency. His supporters dismiss allegations that he upset {{the balance of power in}} Yugoslavia as a propaganda ploy designed to justify <b>separatism.</b>|$|E
