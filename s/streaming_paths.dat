40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new routing strategy, that selects the best network paths in an overlay network, {{in order to}} minimize the distortion perceived by the end user. We first propose a model that reports the video distortion {{as a function of the}} encoding rate, and the loss process parameters (the packet loss ratio, and the average burst length of errors). We then derive a method to compute an accurate estimation of the end-to-end characteristics of a given path in the network topology, as experienced by the media stream. It allows for reducing a set of <b>streaming</b> <b>paths</b> between the server and the client, to a simple virtual link with equivalent end-to-end parameters. Finally, an algorithm is proposed, that finds the best <b>streaming</b> <b>paths</b> in the overlay network, in terms of media distortion. Our algorithm therefore takes into account not only the conventional network parameters (e. g. end-to-end available bandwidth), but also other application specific metrics (e. g. video distortion measure and loss process). Interestingly, it is shown that the best route in terms of video distortion, does not necessarily use the highest bandwidth links, but carefully trades off channel reliability and bandwidth. 1...|$|E

40|$|Multimedia {{streaming}} applications {{can significantly}} boost {{the value of}} mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). Live streaming, however, means continuous data delivery, which is a major challenge in MANET. Because of host mobility, a <b>streaming</b> <b>path</b> may be broken easily, causing streaming interruption. In this paper, we address this problem with a light-weighted yet robust streaming protocol. Our technique distinguishes itself from existing ones with two innovative features: proactive link protection (PLP) and receiver-oriented adaptation (ROA). PLP allows a mobile host in a <b>streaming</b> <b>path</b> to find an alternative link before its current one becomes broken. This feature minimizes the chance of having to discover a new path in urgent to replace a broken link. While PLP protects the streaming continuity, ROA ensures the streaming efficiency by minimizing the hop number of a <b>streaming</b> <b>path.</b> Specifically, ROA dynamically adjusts {{the path of a}} live stream to make it as straight as possible along the direction from the source to the receiver. We evaluate the proposed technique through simulation, and our extensive study indicates that the new technique can support robust streaming applications with a minimal control overhead.

40|$|The {{path of the}} Gulf Stream {{exhibits}} {{two modes}} of variability: wavelike spatial meanders associated with instability processes and large-sale lateral shifts of the path presumably due to atmospheric forcing. The objectives {{of this study are}} to examine the temporal variation of the intensity of spatial meandering in the stream, to characterize large-scale lateral oscillations in the <b>stream's</b> <b>path,</b> and to study the correlation betwen these two dynamically distinct modes of variability. The data used for this analysis are path displacemets ofthe Gulf Stream between 75 deg and 60 deg W obtained from AVHRR-derived (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) infrared images for the period April 1982 through December 1989. Meandering intensity, measured by the spatial root-mean-sqaure displacement of the <b>stream</b> <b>path,</b> displays a 9 -month dominant periodicity which is persistent through the study period. The 9 -month fluctuation in meandering intensity {{may be related to the}} interaction of Rosseby waves with the stream. Interannual variation of meandering intensity is also found to be significant, with meandering being mich more intense during 1985 than it was in 1987. Annual variation, however,is weak and not well-defined. The spatially averaged position of the stream, which reflects nonmeandering large-scale lateral oscillations of the <b>stream</b> <b>path,</b> is dominated by an annual cycle. On average, the mean position is farthest north in November and farthest south in April. The first empirical orthogonal function mode of the space-time path displacements represents lateral oscillatins that are in-phase over the space-time domain. Interannual oscillations are also observed and are found to be weaker than the annual oscillation. The eigenvalue of the first mode indicates that about 21. 5 % of the total space-time variability of the <b>stream</b> <b>path</b> can be attibuted to domain-wide lateral oscillation.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a part of a larger study of the impact of Rossby waves on the {{variability}} of the Gulf <b>Stream</b> <b>path.</b> In the framework of the larger study, this thesis focuses on characterizations of the observed Rossby wave field in the North Atlantic, and of the large scale variability of the Gulf <b>Stream</b> <b>path</b> between Cape Hatteras and the Newfoundland Ridge. ^ The Rossby wave study, the first manuscript of the thesis, is based on satellite observations of sea surface height. As in previous studies, the wave speed was found to be larger than that expected from theory and the amplitude of the waves to be larger {{in the western part of}} the North Atlantic relative to those in the eastern part. Not observed in previous studies is our observation that the more energetic waves in the western part of the basin originate not from the eastern boundary but from a relatively compact source located southeast of the Grand Banks. ^ The second manuscript in the thesis introduces a method of analysis for two-dimensional (2 D) data which, compared with most conventional methods, does not rely on the assumption that the analyzed dynamics are linear and stationary. This method was developed because preliminary analysis of the Gulf <b>Stream</b> <b>path</b> data, analyzed as a latitude value on a longitude-time grid, i. e., a 2 D field, revealed significant nonstationarity in both time and space. The proposed method relies on the 1 D Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) designed specifically for analysis of nonlinear, nonstationary data. ^ Analysis of the large scale variability of the Gulf <b>Stream</b> <b>path</b> for 1985 - 2001 using the methodology discussed in the second manuscript is the subject of the third manuscript. This analysis suggests that the observed variability is well represented by a combination of two regimes: (1) quasidecadal unidirectional shifts of the path between Cape Hatteras and the Newfoundland Ridge; (2) bi-modal interannual variations comprised of either a relatively smooth path or a stationary-wave [...] -like structure between Cape Hatteras and the New England Seamount Chain (NESC). We propose a separate index for each regime in order to adequately represent climate scale fluctuations of the path. Our results also suggest that the NESC strongly constrains the Gulf <b>Stream</b> <b>path</b> on larger than annual time scales. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT [...] The Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have {{advanced}} to the multimedia processing and streaming applications {{in the recent past}} with the advent of higher end motes like the iMote 2. The data rates available from the radios of the WSN nodes are low so that for streaming applications to be sustained in these networks, special cares have to be taken to allow only one <b>streaming</b> <b>path</b> in any node’s neighborhood, which means in a common sink network, all the protocol layers in the nodes are optimized for maintaining a single <b>streaming</b> <b>path</b> in the network at any point of time. In a dense WSN, for single <b>path</b> optimized <b>streaming</b> for maximum throughput, the MAC and routing layers have to be specially designed to avoid traffic generation from nodes in the vicinity of an ongoing <b>streaming</b> <b>path.</b> In this paper, a routing protocol is described which is built on top of a streaming MAC protocol called MLMAC. The Single-path Streaming Optimized Routing Protocol (SPSORP) establishes the routing table during the initialization phase of the protocol and suspends the route updates when streaming is detected in the vicinity of a node. The simulation in OMNeT++ simulator confirms the possibility of streaming in a dense WSN with the combination of MLMAC and SPSORD to the tune of compressed voic...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{addresses}} the media-specific rate allocation problem in multipath networks. The streaming rate on each path is determined {{such that the}} end-to-end media distortion is minimized, when the receiving client aggregates packets received via multiple network channels. As {{it is difficult for}} the media server to have the full knowledge about the network status, we propose a distributed path selection and rate allocation algorithm. The network nodes participate to the optimization strategy, based on their local view of the network status. This eliminates the need for end-to-end network monitoring, and allows for the deployment of large scale rate allocation solutions. We design an optimal rate allocation algorithm, where the media client iteratively updates the best set of <b>streaming</b> <b>paths.</b> According to this rate allocation, each intermediate nodes then forwards incoming media flows on the outgoing paths, in a distributed manner. The proposed algorithm is shown to quickly converge to the optimal rate allocation solution, and hence to lead to stable rate allocation solutions. We also propose a greedy distributed algorithm that achieves closeto-optimal end-to-end distortion performance in a single pass. Both algorithms are shown to outperform simple heuristic-based rate allocation approaches for numerous random network topologies, and therefore offer an interesting solution for media-specific rate allocation over large scale multi-path networks.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Mechanical and Nuclear EngineeringDouglas S. McGregorInterest in high-efficiency {{replacements}} for thin-film-coated thermal neutron detectors {{led to the}} development of single-sided microstructured semiconductor neutron detectors (MSNDs). MSNDs are designed with micro-sized trench structures that are etched into a vertically-oriented pvn-junction diode, and backfilled with a neutron converting material, such as ⁶LiF. Neutrons absorbed by the converting material produce a pair of charged-particle reaction products that can be measured by the diode substrate. MSNDs have higher neutron-absorption and reaction-product counting efficiencies than their thin-film-coated counterparts, resulting in up to a 10 x increase in intrinsic thermal neutron detection efficiency. The detection efficiency for a single-sided MSND is reduced by neutron <b>streaming</b> <b>paths</b> between the conversion-material filled regions that consequently allow neutrons to pass undetected through the detector. Previously, the highest reported intrinsic thermal neutron detection efficiency for a single MSND was approximately 30 %. Methods for double-stacking and aligning MSNDs to reduce neutron streaming produced devices with an intrinsic thermal neutron detection efficiency of 42 %. Presented here is a new type of MSND that features a complementary second set of trenches that are etched into the back-side of the detector substrate. These dual-sided microstructured semiconductor neutron detectors (DS-MSNDs) have the ability to absorb and detect neutrons that stream through the front-side, effectively doubling the detection efficiency of a single-sided device. DS-MSND sensors are theoretically capable of achieving greater than 80 % intrinsic thermal neutron detection efficiency for a 1 -mm thick device. Prototype DS-MSNDs with diffused pvp-junction operated at 0 -V applied bias have achieved 53. 54 ± 0. 61 %, exceeding that of the single-sided MSNDs and double-stacked MSNDs to represent a new record for detection efficiency for such solid-state devices...|$|E
40|$|Spatial channel theory, {{initially}} {{introduced in}} 1977 by M. L. Williams {{and colleagues at}} ORNL, is {{a powerful tool for}} shield design optimization. It focuses on so called ''contributon'' flux and current of particles (a fraction of the total of neutrons, photons, etc.) which contribute directly or through their progeny to a pre-specified response, such as a detector reading, dose rate, reaction rate, etc., at certain locations of interest. Particles that do not contribute directly or indirectly to the pre-specified response, such as particles that are absorbed or leak out, are ignored. Contributon fluxes and currents are computed based on combined forward and adjoint transport solutions. The initial concepts were considerably improved by Abu-Shumays, Selva, and Shure by introducing steam functions and response flow functions. Plots of such functions provide both qualitative and quantitative information on dominant particle flow paths and identify locations within a shield configuration that are important in contributing to the response of interest. Previous work was restricted to two dimensional (2 -D) x-y rectangular and r-z cylindrical geometries. This paper generalizes previous work to three-dimensional x-y-z geometry, since it is now practical to solve realistic 3 -D problems with multidimensional transport programs. As in previous work, new analytic expressions are provided for folding spherical harmonics representations of forward and adjoint transport flux solutions. As a result, the main integrals involve in spatial channel theory are computed exactly and more efficiently than by numerical quadrature. The analogy with incompressible fluid flow is also applied to obtain visual qualitative and quantitative measures of important <b>streaming</b> <b>paths</b> that could prove vital for shield design optimization.

Accuracy {{is a prerequisite for}} every professional visu-alization in order to provide a reliable base for analysis of a data set. Geometric flow visualization has a long tradition and comes in very different flavors. Among these, <b>stream,</b> <b>path</b> and streak lines are known to be very useful for both 2 D and 3 D flows.

Two algo-rithms are proposed for efficiently and accurately generating these lines using modern graphics hardware. Each includes a scheme for adaptive time-stepping. The adaptivity for <b>stream</b> and <b>path</b> lines is achieved through a new processing idea we call “selective transform feedback”. The adaptivity for streak lines combines adaptive time-stepping and a geometric refinement of the curve itself.

In the first approach, only one stream sequence is constructed by successively selecting the strongest streams from the null spaces of the previously selected ones.
