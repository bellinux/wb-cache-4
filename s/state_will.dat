5|$|The {{administration}} of each university {{is divided into}} the Senate, the rector, faculty meetings, faculty councils and deans (however, some universities are not divided into faculties). The Senate ultimately makes decisions on the running and organisation of the institution, and formulates policy.

5|$|Equality before law: Article 14 of the {{constitution}} guarantees that all people shall be equally protected {{by the laws of}} the country. It means that the <b>State</b> <b>will</b> treat people in the same circumstances alike. This article also means that individuals, whether citizens of India or otherwise shall be treated differently if the circumstances are different.|$|E
5|$|Calculations for {{solution}} chemistry {{indicate that}} again, the maximum oxidation state of dubnium, +5, {{will be more}} stable than that of niobium and tantalum, and the +3 <b>state</b> <b>will</b> be less stable than those of niobium and tantalum. The propensity towards hydrolysis of cations in the highest oxidation state {{is expected to continue}} to decrease within group 5; however, it is still expected to be quite rapid. Complexation of dubnium is expected to follow group 5 trends in its richness. Calculations for hydroxo-chlorido- complexes have been conducted; they show reversal in the trends of complex formation and extraction of group 5 elements, with dubnium being more prone to do so than tantalum.|$|E

5|$|Eight of {{the eleven}} member Big Ten {{institutions}} will return at least 75 percent of their offensive production during the 2009–10 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season, unless underclassmen declare for the 2009 NBA Draft. Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota and Ohio <b>State</b> <b>will</b> return 90 percent of their total offensive production. The Buckeyes could return 100 percent of their scoring contingent next season. All five first-team All-Conference honorees were sophomores and are all projected to return as juniors. Overall, the Big Ten could return 80.5 percent of its offensive production from 2008 to 2009, and no team should lose {{more than half of}} its total scoring unit next year.|$|E
5|$|The inert pair {{effects in}} livermorium should be even {{stronger}} than for polonium {{and hence the}} +2 oxidation state becomes more stable than the +4 state, which would be stabilized only by the most electronegative ligands; this {{is reflected in the}} expected ionization energies of livermorium, where there are large gaps between the second and third ionization energies (corresponding to the breaching of the unreactive 7p1/2 shell) and fourth and fifth ionization energies. Indeed, the 7s electrons are expected to be so inert that the +6 <b>state</b> <b>will</b> not be possible to attain. The melting and boiling points of livermorium are expected to continue the trends down the chalcogens; thus livermorium should melt at a higher temperature than polonium, but boil at a lower temperature. It should also be denser than polonium (α-Lv: 12.9g/cm3; α-Po: 9.2g/cm3); like polonium it should also form an α and a β allotrope. The electron of the hydrogen-like livermorium atom (oxidized so that it only has one electron, Lv115+) is expected to move so fast that it has a mass 1.86 times that of a stationary electron, due to relativistic effects. For comparison, the figures for hydrogen-like polonium and tellurium are expected to be 1.26 and 1.080 respectively.|$|E
