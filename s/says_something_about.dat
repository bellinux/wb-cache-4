25|$|The Ordnance Survey {{map shows}} the complex web of fields around the village, {{but it does}} not reveal that many of the fields have local names. Sometimes a name is simply those of the owner, but {{sometimes}} it <b>says</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the nature of the ground or the use to which it has been put. The Field names therefore represent a valuable repository of social history.|$|E
500|$|From series two onward, {{the show}} has {{maintained}} a standard format. It {{is presented in two}} halves; in the first half, Lloyd and the curator introduce the three guests, provide an explanation of who they are, and the five engage in a general discussion. In the second half, the curator declares the Museum open for donations, and each guest explains what they wish to [...] "donate" [...] to the museum (again, as the museum is fictional, nothing is actually exchanged). Questioning of all three guests ensures that everyone <b>says</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> each donation.|$|E

5000|$|A sign (or representamen) represents, in the {{broadest}} possible sense of [...] "represents". It is <b>something</b> interpretable as <b>saying</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>something.</b> It is not necessarily symbolic, linguistic, or artificial.|$|R

500|$|The film {{draws on}} a number of macabre {{incidents}} from international banking: the Bank of Credit and Commerce International crisis in 1991, the murder of Roberto Calvi, an alleged banker to the Sicilian Mafia, in London in 1982, and the assassination by poisoning of Georgi Markov in London in 1978. The bank is making large loans to rogue states and simultaneously acting as their munitions broker. The script offers the chilling insight that the creditors are the real winners of any conflict. A.O. Scott commented on the opportunity to make a film critical of international finance, [...] "that multinational weapons manufacturers can be portrayed as more decent, civic-minded and principled than global financiers surely <b>says</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the state of the world." ...|$|E
500|$|Robert Brunner, Apple's head of {{industrial}} design at the time, led the design team that developed the laptop, including its trackball and granite color. Brunner said he designed the PowerBook [...] "so {{it would be}} as easy to use and carry as a regular book". The dark granite grey color set it apart from other notebook computers of the time and also from Apple's other products, which traditionally were beige or platinum grey. The trackball, another new design element, was placed {{in the middle of the}} computer, allowing the PowerBook to be easily operated by both left- and right-handed users. The designers were trying to create a fashion statement with the overall design of the laptop, which they felt made it a more personal accessory, like a wallet or briefcase. Brunner said: [...] "It <b>says</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the identity of the person who is carrying it".|$|E
500|$|While it only {{appeared}} {{in the first few}} games of the series, MissingNo. has had a significant impact. Calling it a [...] "programming quirk", Nintendo warned against encountering it, claiming players could possibly have to restart the game from the beginning to remove the graphical glitches. Despite Nintendo's warning, information on how to encounter MissingNo. was printed in several magazines and player's guides due to its perceived positive effect. Certain players attempted to sell [...] "tips" [...] on capturing MissingNo. for up to $200. Despite it not being an intentional part of the game, in 2009, IGN included MissingNo. in its list of the top video game Easter eggs, citing its usefulness in replicating the game's rarer items. IGN stated in a related article, [...] "It really <b>says</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Pokémon fans that they took what is a potentially game-ruining glitch and used it as a shortcut to level up their Pokémon," [...] and later called it an [...] "unforgettable" [...] glitch that helped push the original games to [...] "gaming super stardom".|$|E

5000|$|Doug Williams gained {{internet}} notoriety in 2006 when {{a clip of}} him at a 2003 roasting of Emmitt Smith surfaced on the internet. During Williams's set Jamie Foxx continuously interrupted Williams' performance, speaking {{into his}} own microphone and interrupting Williams and making sarcastic remarks, such as that Williams <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> how hard life is for black people or <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Emmitt Smith and end his routine.|$|R

500|$|Ewan Stewart as First Officer William Murdoch: The {{officer who}} {{is put in}} charge of the bridge on the night the ship struck the iceberg. During a rush for the lifeboats, Murdoch shoots Tommy Ryan as well as another {{passenger}} in a momentary panic, then commits suicide out of guilt. When Murdoch's nephew Scott saw the film, he objected to his uncle's portrayal as damaging to Murdoch's heroic reputation. A few months later, Fox vice-president Scott Neeson went to Dalbeattie, Scotland, where Murdoch lived, to deliver a personal apology, and also presented a £5000 donation to Dalbeattie High School to boost the school's William Murdoch Memorial Prize. Cameron apologized on the DVD commentary, but stated that there were officers who fired gunshots to enforce the [...] "women and children first" [...] policy. According to Cameron, his depiction of Murdoch is that of an [...] "honorable man," [...] not of a man [...] "gone bad" [...] or of a [...] "cowardly murderer." [...] He added, [...] "I'm not sure you'd find that same sense of responsibility and total devotion to duty today. This guy had half of his lifeboats launched before his counterpart on the port side had even launched one. That <b>says</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> character and heroism." ...|$|E
500|$|Sgt. Pepper was {{the first}} major pop/rock LP to include its {{complete}} lyrics, which appeared on the back cover. Those lyrics were the subject of critical analysis; for instance, in late 1967 the album {{was the subject of a}} scholarly inquiry by American literary critic and professor of English Richard Poirier, who observed that his students were [...] "listening to the group's music with a degree of engagement that he, as a teacher of literature, could only envy". Poirier identified what he termed its [...] "mixed allusiveness": [...] "It's unwise ever to assume that they're doing only one thing or expressing themselves in only one style... one kind of feeling about a subject isn't enough... any single induced feeling must often exist within the context of seemingly contradictory alternatives." [...] McCartney said at the time: [...] "We write songs. We know what we mean by them. But in a week someone else <b>says</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> it, and you can't deny it.... You put your own meaning at your own level to our songs." [...] The album's elaborate cover also attracted considerable interest and study. A collage designed by pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth, it depicted the group as the fictional band referred to in the album's title track standing in front of a crowd of famous people. The heavy moustaches worn by the group reflected the growing influence of hippie style, while cultural historian Jonathan Harris describes their [...] "brightly coloured parodies of military uniforms" [...] as a knowingly [...] "anti-authoritarian and anti-establishment" [...] display. [...] In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked it number one on its list of the [...] "500 Greatest Albums of All Time".|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} propositions all imply one another: [...] "Every {{object is}} either black {{or not a}} raven", [...] "Every raven is black", and [...] "Every non-black object is a non-raven." [...] They are therefore, by definition, logically equivalent. However, the three propositions have different domains: the first proposition <b>says</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> [...] "every object", while the second <b>says</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> [...] "every raven".|$|E

2500|$|Gerald Janzen, Professor Emeritus of Old Testament at Christian Theological Seminary, grouped {{interpretations of}} the word , echad, in [...] into two sorts: a word that <b>says</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> God (for example, [...] "One" [...] or [...] "Unique") or a word that <b>says</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> God's claim on Israel (for example, [...] "alone"). Concluding that one should read the word as [...] "One," [...] Jansen argued that the claim upon Israel to love God with all its heart and soul and {{strength}} in [...] follows upon an affirmation that God is [...] "One," [...] and this affirmation is to identify in God the dependable ground upon which an exhortation to wholehearted loyalty may appropriately be made.|$|E
2500|$|When {{you write}} a song and you mean it one way, and someone comes up and <b>says</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> it that you didn't think of—you can't deny it. Like [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds," [...] people came up and said, cunningly, [...] "Right, I get it. L-S-D," [...] and it was when papers were talking about LSD, but we never thought about it.|$|E
2500|$|The placing of the tractate in {{the order}} of [...] "damages" [...] <b>says</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the {{attitude}} of the Sages towards idolatry. By engaging in idolatry, a person is seen as in effect denying God's creation and doing actual damage to the spiritual forces of creation. It also has the effect of removing the action of idolatry from a purely abstract notion into a real transgression, with tangible effects and punishments, alongside theft and swearing a false oath.|$|E

2500|$|... "Let Me Be the One" [...] was remixed in 1991, with an {{extended}} beginning, end, {{and a different}} piano line. This remix can only {{be found on the}} From the Top box set. It starts with Richard counting off, and Richard's piano line is different from the original mix. The fadeout is also removed. The reason Karen stopped singing suddenly in this version is because she forgets the words, which is why she <b>says</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> [...] "where I can figure out where the melody is, I'll sing it"...|$|E
2500|$|In his {{appraisal}} of Harrison's solo career for Mojo in 2011, John Harris described the album as [...] "Fabdom's answer to Metal Machine Music", adding: [...] "Not exactly music, though you could conceivably assume the endless whooshes and random notes were {{the work of}} admirably out-there Krautrockers." [...] In his article on the Moog for the same magazine, in 1997, John McCready wrote that the album conveyed [...] "caveman confusion" [...] on Harrison's part, but he grouped it with experimental releases by Jean-Jacques Perrey, Dick Hyman, the Hellers, Mort Garson and TONTO's Expanding Head Band, saying: [...] "It <b>says</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the compelling-even-when-crap nature of the Moog {{that it is possible}} to own and enjoy all these records." [...] Luke Turner of The Quietus includes it among his favourite electronic-music albums. He says that Harrison's fascination with the Moog typified the interest the new instrument received from top rock musicians at the time, and he adds: [...] "Luckily for us he decided to release it (with a great cover painting by a small child) ..." [...] Writing for New York Observer, Ron Hart considers it to be one of Harrison's unjustly overlooked works and he says that while it was tainted by the controversy with Krause, the project stands as an [...] "oddly visionary testament to the Zapple label and its unsung promise to bring the avant-garde to the pop crowd".|$|E
2500|$|Horowitz taught seven {{students}} between 1937 and 1962: Nico Kaufmann (1937), Byron Janis (1944–1948), Gary Graffman (1953–1955), Coleman Blumfield (1956–1958), Ronald Turini (1957–1963), Alexander Fiorillo (1960–1962) and Ivan Davis (1961–1962). Janis {{described his}} relationship to Horowitz during that period as a surrogate son, and he often traveled with Horowitz and his wife during concert tours. Davis was invited {{to become one of}} Horowitz's students after receiving a call from him the day after he won the Franz Liszt Competition. At the time, Davis had a contract with Columbia Records and a national tour planned. Horowitz claimed that he had only taught three students during that period. [...] "Many young people say they have been pupils of Horowitz, but there were only three. Janis, Turini, who I brought to the stage, and Graffman. If someone else claims it, it's not true. I had some who played for me for four months. Once a week. I stopped work with them, because they did not progress." [...] According to biographer Glenn Plaskin, [...] "The fact that Horowitz disavowed most of his students and blurred the facts regarding their periods of study <b>says</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the erratic nature of his personality during that period". Horowitz returned to coaching in the 1980s, working with Murray Perahia, who already had an established career, and Eduardus Halim.|$|E

2500|$|Immediately {{following}} the incident, Timberlake sounded unapologetic for his actions, telling Access Hollywood, [...] "Hey man, we love giving you all {{something to talk}} about." [...] Timberlake released a statement saying [...] "I am sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl. It was not intentional and is regrettable." [...] However, Timberlake was not required to film a video apology as Jackson was. Timberlake also addressed the incident at the Grammy Awards the following week, which Jackson was banned from attending after being scheduled as a presenter, saying [...] "I know it's been a rough week on everybody. What occurred was unintentional, completely regrettable and I apologize if you guys are offended." [...] Timberlake gave an additional interview at the Grammy event and stated, [...] "All I could say was, 'Oh, my God. Oh, my God,'" [...] Timberlake said. [...] "I looked at her. They brought a towel up on stage. They covered her up. I was completely embarrassed and just walked off the stage as quickly as I could. I'm frustrated at the whole situation. I'm frustrated that my character is being questioned. And {{the fact of the}} matter is, you know, I've had a good year, a really good year, especially with my music." [...] Timberlake later declared, [...] "It was something that went wrong. Then I felt like, I'm going to show everyone that this was something that didn't affect me, and I'm going to show up at the Grammys." [...] He later said he was unable to attend most of the halftime rehearsals due to being on tour in Spain, having only one day to rehearse. While promoting his sophomore album FutureSex/LoveSounds over two years later, Timberlake expressed regret for his behavior, saying, [...] "In my honest opinion now ... I could've handled it better. ... I'm part of a community that consider themselves artists. And if there was something I could have done in her defense that was more than I realized then, I would have. But the other half of me was like, 'Wow. We still haven't found the weapons of mass destruction and everybody cares about this!'" [...] He added, [...] "I probably got 10 percent of the blame, and that <b>says</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> society ... I think that America's harsher on women. And I think that America is, you know, unfairly harsh on ethnic people." ...|$|E
