25|$|Panic {{disorder}} is an anxiety disorder characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks. Panic attacks are sudden periods of intense fear that may include palpitations, sweating, shaking, shortness of breath, numbness, or {{a feeling that}} <b>something</b> <b>really</b> bad is going to happen. The maximum degree of symptoms occurs within minutes. There may be ongoing worries about having further attacks and avoidance of places where attacks {{have occurred in the}} past.|$|E
25|$|After {{the battle}} of Ripple Field (13 April 1643) and his defeat by Prince Maurice, Sir William Waller retreated to Tewkesbury, and on to Gloucester. When there he found orders {{to go to his}} {{headquarters}} which were located in Bristol. This he delayed to do, the historian J.W. Willis-Bund stated that Waller was probably thinking it was necessary to do something to maintain his reputation as there was no love lost between him and Essex. His bad luck in the operations against Maurice rendered it necessary for him to achieve <b>something</b> <b>really</b> brilliant before he returned to Bristol. He accordingly did not obey his orders, stating it would not be safe for him to leave Gloucester until Hereford and Worcester were reduced. He, therefore, set to work to carry out this out.|$|E

500|$|Although Fightstar's {{style is}} widely known as post-hardcore, they have {{incorporated}} diverse musical influences {{and have been}} called metal, emo, and alternative rock. According to Kerrang!, the band's influences are post-rock, heavy metal and hardcore punk. Simpson echoed this, describing their musical aim as trying to [...] "combine the light and dark shades, to make something utterly brutal and really heavy {{and on the other}} side have <b>something</b> <b>really</b> delicate and beautiful. The fusion of those things is what Fightstar does." ...|$|E

[...] Smythe's first attempt was to acquire future Hockey Hall of Famer Edgar Laprade, {{at the time a}} star in senior hockey whose rights were owned by the New York Rangers. A deal could not be made as New York General Manager Lester Patrick was asking for several players in return.|$|E
500|$|One of the motifs in {{the story}} is amnesia, or memory loss; three of the main characters—Yuichi, Ayu and Makoto—suffer from amnesia in varying degrees; this {{is used as a}} plot device to advance the story. Another motif deals with the {{favorite}} foods of the five main heroines. Newtype USA stated in an article on Kanon that [...] "it's when the characters are eating <b>something</b> <b>really</b> tasty that they seem most beautiful and alive", despite the somber setting and overall tone of the series. These five foods of choice are: taiyaki (Ayu), strawberries (Nayuki), nikuman (Makoto), ice cream (Shiori), and gyudon (Mai).|$|E
500|$|Unlike the band's {{previous}} two albums, Wasting Light {{was recorded in}} Dave Grohl's garage in Encino, California, {{as opposed to the}} band's home-built studio, Studio 606. Regarding this decision, Grohl states: [...] "There's poetry in being the band that can sell out Wembley but also makes a record in a garage. Why go into the most expensive studio with the biggest producer and use the best state-of-the-art equipment? Where's the rock'n'roll in that?" [...] Grohl added {{it was a way to}} [...] "do <b>something</b> <b>really</b> primal sounding", innovate, break people's expectations and [...] "make records the way we used to fucking make records".|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from contemporary critics. Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine was unimpressed by Swift's vocals, describing them as unpleasant and thin. Keefe added that her voice often cracked and, therefore, prevented the song from becoming an anthem. Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone magazine considered the track to be vague. Dave Heaton of PopMatters compared [...] "Change" [...] and Swift's [...] "Long Live", both which ended Fearless and Speak Now (2010), respectively. He stated, [...] "There’s <b>something</b> <b>really</b> generic about the song, but that quality becomes {{the cornerstone of}} an anthem." [...] Heaton also commented that the song was appealing to multiple audiences, {{as long as they}} felt restrained by any scenario.|$|E
500|$|After Gasketball release, Boxleiter and Wohlwend {{planned a}} celebratory road {{trip to a}} game jam in Victoria, British Columbia. The game did not fare as expected, so Boxleiter {{wanted to use the}} jam to create [...] "something new, ... <b>something</b> <b>really</b> small and perfect". By the end of the two-day jam, the core mirror {{reflection}} mechanics of TouchTone were in place, though it would take two years of sporadic work to finalize the remainder of the game. In TouchTone, the player monitors phone calls as part of a government surveillance program to find public threats. The story is told through a series of reflection puzzles wherein the player swipes the screen to reflect a beam around a room to its intended destination.|$|E

Speaking of Jacqui's sudden change of heart, Cooper states: [...] "He pulls out a knife. That changes the situation - the dynamic changes immediately. He could do <b>something</b> <b>really</b> horrible to her - it's not necessarily about killing someone, he could slash her face or anything. In a situation like that, your mind plays tricks as you wonder what someone could do to you." [...] Cooper has spoken of her feelings of responsibility to portray it correctly and stated [...] "I wanted to show how horrendous it was for Jacqui. She wonders whether she could die like this - all to protect her family…" ...|$|E

500|$|Eveanescence cover artwork was {{introduced}} on the band's website on August 30, 2011. It is their first album cover {{which does not}} feature Lee. In an interview, she discussed the cover: [...] "Well, both of our other records are me on the cover, and I think it's cool to have that photo, you know, that people can look at and go, 'OK, that's who that is.' But I feel like, by now, they know who we are, and I wanted <b>something</b> <b>really</b> different. I didn't feel like {{we had to put}} a photo on the cover, I wanted it to be more mysterious and more about Evanescence itself, not just me." [...] The cover, black with vapor behind the band's name, is a play on the meaning of [...] "evanescence" [...] ("to dissipate like vapor").|$|E
500|$|The pieces he {{submitted}} to Bird were at first untitled (Pound called the submission Blank); later the title in our time– from the Book of Common Prayer– was chosen. Bird printed {{the volume on}} a hand-press with handmade paper, telling Hemingway, [...] "I'm going to pull <b>something</b> <b>really</b> fancy with your book". The book contained eighteen vignettes and only thirty-one pages; each one was laid out with plenty of white space, highlighting the brevity of the prose. According to Cohen, the [...] "visual suddenness intensifies its narrative abruptness, heightens the shock of violence, and the chillingly matter-of-fact tone". The book's presentation was intended as unconventional, with its use of lowercase throughout and lack of quotation marks. When challenged by American editors {{over the use of}} lowercase in the titles, Hemingway admitted that it could be seen as [...] "silly and affected".|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said he [...] "started out liking this movie, {{while waiting}} for <b>something</b> <b>really</b> {{interesting}} to happen. When nothing did, I still didn't dislike it; I assume the X-Men will further develop their personalities {{if there is a}} sequel, and maybe find time to get involved in a story. No doubt fans of the comics will understand subtle allusions and fine points of behavior; they should linger in the lobby after each screening to answer questions." [...] He also gave it a [...] "thumbs down" [...] on Ebert & Roeper. [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone noted, [...] "Since it's Wolverine's movie, any X-Men or Women who don't hinge directly on his story get short shrift. As Storm, Halle Berry can do neat tricks with weather, but her role is gone with the wind. It sucks that Stewart and McKellen, two superb actors, are underused." ...|$|E

500|$|Azaria {{produced}} {{and starred in}} the sitcom Imagine That in 2002, replacing Emeril mid-season in the NBC lineup. He played Josh Miller, a comedy writer, who [...] "transformed" [...] each episode into a character Miller has imagined, [...] "provid a humorous outlet for his frustrations at home and work". Production closed after five episodes and it was canceled after just two aired, due to poor critical reaction and ratings. Azaria later commented on the show: [...] "I wanted to do <b>something</b> <b>really</b> truthful and interesting and impactful. We {{had a bunch of}} executives sitting in the room, all agreeing that The Larry Sanders Show was our favorite thing on television, but we couldn't do it on NBC, and nor would we want to from a business standpoint; it simply wouldn't make enough money. By the time it aired, the writing was sort of on the wall, and I don't blame them at all. It was apparent it wasn't working." ...|$|E
500|$|The group {{purposely}} {{cut short}} {{the amount of}} time set aside for recording the album, and did not notify its label before beginning work on the record. The members hoped that these steps would bring them back to the days when they were a young, broke band who had to finish an album before the money ran out. [...] "There was <b>something</b> <b>really</b> interesting about that creative process when we were starting out," [...] explained Stump. [...] "The more time you have, the more potential you have for excess." [...] He felt that the process was reminiscent of the making of Take This to Your Grave because both albums were created using a [...] "first-thought, best-thought" [...] mentality: [...] "I think we were trying to find what making a record that way would sound like now, but with four adult Fall Out Boys." [...] Trohman called the recording process [...] "fun because [...] was so collaborative," [...] but difficult because it was rushed.|$|E
500|$|To {{create the}} sound of the Clickers, the third stage of the Infected, the team found {{inspiration}} from a report on the journalism show 20/20 (1978–present) about blind children using clicking noises to communicate. [...] "We liked the idea of taking this benign sound and attributing it to <b>something</b> <b>really</b> scary," [...] said Druckmann. In addition, the team wanted to reflect the creature's feeling of pain and suffering, attempting to balance it with a sense of creepiness. The sound team created {{the sound of}} the Clicker first, realising early that it was the most challenging. To create the sound, they hired voice actors to perform their renditions. When voice actress Misty Lee provided her own rendition, a noise that Kovats described as originating in the [...] "back of the throat", Kovats and senior sound designer Derrick Espino agreed that it was what they wanted. Kovats then emulated the sound to feature in the game.|$|E
