5|$|Promos for {{the season}} nine premiere {{announced}} that actress Jorja Fox would return, and <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> in three clips. However, Sidle left again after the second episode. She appeared again in the final scene of the tenth episode of season nine when she appears {{to be working on}} a research team in Costa Rica, where Grissom joins her after leaving CSI. Then they are married.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} videos {{depicting}} <b>her</b> death. One <b>shows</b> <b>her</b> collapsing to the ground, apparently still conscious. The second <b>shows</b> <b>her</b> only after {{she appears to}} lose consciousness and begins to bleed heavily. The third video <b>shows</b> <b>her</b> just as she begins to bleed profusely.|$|R

5|$|Some time in July, {{probably}} just before Climbié {{was admitted to}} the Central Middlesex Hospital, Kouao befriended a couple, Julien and Chantal Kimbidima. Climbié and Kouao visited their home several times over the following months. According to Chantal, Kouao would shout at Climbié all the time and never <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> affection.|$|E
5|$|After a {{difficult}} start, Leech improved in her second year. At the Victorian Championships, she <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> potential by setting a state record of 17.4 seconds (s) for the 25-yard freestyle in the under-8 division. The following year, she covered 25 yards in 15.7 seconds, three seconds faster than Davies had {{done at the}} same age. She progressed steadily, sweeping the state age titles from nine to 13, setting records that were often faster than those by boys of the same age.|$|E
5|$|Bamber's lawyers {{argued that}} images of Sheila {{taken by a}} police {{photographer}} at around 9am on 7 August 1985 <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> blood was still wet. According to the defence team, had she been killed before 3:30am, as the prosecution said, the blood would have congealed by 9am. They argue that she was alive when Bamber was standing outside {{the house with the}} police, shot herself in the kitchen just as the police entered, then ran up one of the staircases to the bedroom, where she shot herself again, this time fatally.|$|E
50|$|Lloyd's Register for 1787 <b>shows</b> <b>her</b> master as W. Hunter and her {{trade as}} London-St. Petersburg. However, a later {{addition}} to the entry <b>shows</b> <b>her</b> master as D. Sinclair, and her trade as London-Botany Bay. It does not report any armament, which is not surprising as Britain was not at war with anyone. It still <b>shows</b> <b>her</b> launch year as 1784 and her burthen as 650 tons (bm).|$|R

5|$|In Erdely's story, Jackie {{disclosed}} to friends Cindy, Andy, and Randall {{the identity of}} her date to the fraternity party {{and said that he}} was the ringleader of the rape. Later media analysis of photos Jackie <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> friends of her date demonstrated that they were pictures taken from the public social media profile of a former high-school classmate of Jackie, who was not a student of the University of Virginia, did not live in the Charlottesville area, and was out of state at an athletic competition the day of the alleged attack.|$|E
5|$|On 5 May 2011, The Guardian {{reported}} that Mills {{had met with}} officers from the London Metropolitan Police who <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> evidence, seized from private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, which could {{form the basis of}} a claim against the News of the World for breach of privacy over alleged phone hacking. Mills's name and private mobile phone number were listed in Mulcaire's notes along with those of her friends and associates. Mills later alleged that a journalist working for the Mirror Group had admitted to her in 2001 that he had hacked her phone.|$|E

50|$|Now {{she comes}} up behind Natasha the {{terrorist}} (Deirdre Imershein) and ruthlessly shoots {{her in the}} back, freeing the hostages. A previous flashback of Carrie shooting a handgun with <b>her</b> husband <b>shows</b> <b>her</b> {{to be an expert}} shot. This flashback also takes the liberty of <b>showing</b> <b>her</b> second sex scene; the first <b>shows</b> <b>her</b> naked in the shower and then in bed with her husband. Her other physical skills—in combat—are still to be revealed.|$|R
5000|$|While {{the model}} is at the gym, she notices a women with slim legs (preferably when a {{magazine}} <b>shows</b> <b>her</b> quote: [...] "I'd KILL For LEGS Like Yours!"). The woman leaves and the model mutates into a hideous beast, devouring the woman and gaining her features. She is shown with Mark Pontius at a bar, whom she <b>shows</b> <b>her</b> legs to, which grow in size. Various advertisements <b>show</b> <b>her</b> with her enlarged legs. Through an advertisement, we learn that the model has eaten another model.|$|R
5|$|Sotomayor's {{first major}} written opinion was a dissent in the Berghuis v. Thompkins case dealing with Miranda rights. As {{her first year}} neared completion, Sotomayor said she felt swamped by the {{intensity}} and heavy workload of the job. During the oral arguments for National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, Sotomayor <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> increasing familiarity with the Court and its protocols by directing the opening questions of the arguments to Donald Verrilli, the Solicitor General who was representing the government's position.|$|E
5|$|The pair {{formed a}} band in January 1986. Two weeks later, Francis placed an {{advertisement}} seeking a female bass player who liked both folk music act Peter, Paul and Mary and the alternative rock band Hüsker Dü. Kim Deal {{was the only}} respondent, and arrived at the audition without a bass as she had never played the instrument before. She was {{invited to join the}} band as she liked the songs Francis <b>showed</b> <b>her.</b> She obtained a bass, and the trio started rehearsing in Deal's apartment.|$|E
5|$|According to oral history, Andriamasinavalona {{asked the}} {{guardian}} of Matsatso, {{one of the three}} most prominent royal idols, to ask the idol which of his sons should rule after him. The guardian hesitated to declare the idol's choice, but after the king promised no ill reaction to the decision, the man declared the successor to be Andrianavalonimerina. However, the king had hoped that the successor would be another son, Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana. He decided to test the prophecy by sending one of his wives to the guardian's house, where the population <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> respect by offering zebu for her to eat. The zebu cooked inconsistently, and the king interpreted this as a sign that the guardian was dishonest and intended to seize power himself, so Andriamasinavalona ordered him put to death and had the idol Matsatso discarded in a lake. He then asked the guardians of the two other idols (Kelimalaza and Soratra) to declare a successor; {{the guardian of}} Soratra fled, while the guardian of Kelimalaza stated that only the king could choose his successor.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{ambiguity}} {{over the}} spelling of Deidre's name. In {{the first two}} episodes, the opening and on-screen graphics <b>show</b> <b>her</b> name as [...] "Deidre". Beginning with the third episode, the opening <b>shows</b> <b>her</b> name as [...] "Diedre".|$|R

5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "poker face" [...] was {{directed}} by Takeishi Wataru.

It also <b>shows</b> <b>her</b> playing with animals.|$|R
5|$|By July, {{attempts}} at conciliation had completely collapsed. Maria Theresa's ally, the Elector of Saxony, now became her enemy and GeorgeII declared the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg to be neutral. The Queen {{was once again}} {{in need of help}} from Hungary. In order to obtain it, she granted favours to the Hungarian noblemen and flattered them without conceding to all of their demands. She had already won their support when she appeared in Pressburg in September 1741, hoping to persuade the Diet to call a mass conscription and recognise Francis Stephen as co-ruler. Upon achieving both goals, she <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> gift for theatrical displays by triumphantly holding her son and heir, Joseph, before the Diet, thereby gaining sympathy of the noblemen.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, while {{a sophomore}} at Pennsylvania State University, Parker and his roommate and wrestling teammate, Jean McGianni Celestin, were accused of raping a fellow student. The unnamed accuser stated that Parker and Celestin raped her while she was {{intoxicated}} and unconscious, {{and that she was}} unsure of how many people had been involved. The woman later went to a doctor, who concluded that she had been sexually assaulted, and local authorities taped a phone conversation between her and Parker in which Parker confirmed that it was he and Celestin who had sex with her. She also stated that the two harassed her after she pressed charges, and that they hired a private investigator who <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> picture around campus, revealing her identity.|$|E
5|$|The {{tickets were}} first {{available}} {{to members of}} Gaga's social network website, Littlemonsters.com. They were provided with a unique code for ordering tickets from online, but were limited to four tickets per member. According to Live Nation, the first batch of tickets for the tour went on sale from December 9, 2013, and sell-out shows were reported from Toronto, Winnipeg, Calgary, Los Angeles and Edmonton within hours. This led to two new dates being added to the itinerary: June 26 at Milwaukee's Marcus Amphitheater, and June 28 at Atlantic City's Boardwalk Hall. On January 29, 2014, Gaga released the dates for the European leg of the tour, which would begin September 23, 2014, from Belgium. The singer partnered with British mobile network O2, for a deal which would enable the company's customers to avail tickets for the tour three days prior to the general release. The deal included Gaga being featured in a new advertisement, for promoting the UK leg of the tour and <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> wearing a dress with large, glittering shoulder pads while running towards a concert stage. This {{was the second time}} Gaga partnered with O2, first in November 2013, for exclusive access to the tracks from Artpop, ahead of its UK release. Upon release, Ticketmaster reported that the UK venues sold out within five minutes, prompting the singer to add another two dates in London. In April and May 2014, she released more floor tickets for sale, after ensuring larger crowd capacity for all the UK venues and a total of eight new dates.|$|E

5|$|West Avenal {{departed}} Norfolk on {{a voyage}} to Leith, Scotland on 9 April 1919, but {{was forced to}} return to port after suffering an engine breakdown. Following repairs, she made several voyages between the East Coast of the United States and various destinations in South America, Spain, France and England. A few mentions of the ship crop up in contemporary news accounts. In August 1919, for example, The New York Times shows West Avenal slated for departure to Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 12 August. The following January, the newspaper reported that West Avenal was rammed by the British Leyland Line cargo ship Lacastrian. Departing New York in a dense fog {{on the morning of}} 9 January 1920 for Antwerp, Lacastrian rammed into the port side of West Avenal, which was inbound with a load of onions from Valencia, Spain. The damage was severe enough that West Avenals captain ordered her grounded to avoid sinking in New York Harbor. More than two weeks later, The Washington Post printed a photograph of West Avenal, still grounded off the Red Hook flats. Another report in the Times a year later <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> arrival in Saint-Nazaire, France, on 13 August 1920.|$|E
