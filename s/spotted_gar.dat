Bowfins Amia calva, longnose gars Lepisosteus osseus, and freshwater drums Aplodinotus grunniens had only small corticosteroid increases (14 - 39 ng/mL) during transportation. Corticosteroids increased by intermediate amounts (59 - 184 ng/mL) during transportation in blue catfish Ictalurus furcatus, paddlefish Polyodon spathula, largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus, river carpsuckers Carpiodes carpio, white bass Morone chrysops, striped bass Morone saxatilis, and crappies Pomoxis sp. The greatest increases were 223 ng/mL in gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum and 286 ng/mL in common carp Cyprinus carpio. <b>Spotted</b> and longnose <b>gars,</b> largemouth bass, and common carp also were held in tanks for about 2 months at 21 ░C and then stressed by confinement in a dip net for 30 min.

5000|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>gar</b> (Lepisosteus oculatus) is a {{primitive}} freshwater fish {{of the family}} Lepisosteidae, native to North America from the Lake Erie and southern Lake Michigan drainages south through the Mississippi River basin to Gulf Slope drainages, from lower Apalachicola River in Florida to Nueces River in Texas, USA. It has a profusion of dark spots on its body, head, and fins. <b>Spotted</b> <b>gar</b> are long and have an elongated mouth with many teeth used to eat other fish and crustaceans. They grow to 2 - 3 ft in length and weigh 4 - 6 lb on average, making it {{the smallest of the}} gars. The name Lepisosteus is Greek for [...] "bony scale". Habitat for <b>spotted</b> <b>gar</b> is clear pools of shallow water in creeks, rivers, and lakes.|$|E

5000|$|Today, {{humans are}} {{affecting}} this fish species by destroying habitat and aquatic vegetation, and creating sedimentation {{in the waters}} of North America. Waste and chemical drainage into lakes and rivers causes chemical buildup and contamination of the water. Consequently, the water becomes murkier and causes predatory fish to have high mercury levels or accumulate carcinogenic compounds into their bodies. [...] <b>Spotted</b> <b>gar</b> desire clear pools of water, and anthropogenic factors can decrease their survivability. This species is not on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service federally endangered species list, although in some northern states it is on special concern lists. In Canada, the fish is designated as threatened by the Committee on the Status of endangered wildlife in Canada. For Canadian waters the <b>spotted</b> <b>gar</b> is protected by the Species at Risk Act and the federal Fisheries Act. The Habitat Stewardship Program for Species at Risk works to protect the <b>spotted</b> <b>gar</b> and its habitat. Current management plans for <b>spotted</b> <b>gar</b> include: increasing water quality, minimizing or avoiding pollution, analyzing contaminated samples. [...] The most important biological decline of the species is habitat destruction.|$|E
5000|$|A diet {{study of}} the <b>spotted</b> <b>gar</b> {{reported}} the diet of a <b>spotted</b> <b>gar</b> consists of four species of fish; golden topminnow, warmouth, bluegill, and spotted sunfish, which adds to 18.1% of total food volume in the stomach, while 57.5% of the stomach content was shrimp. Other invertebrates filled the remaining 23.6% of the stomach. Gar are also known to eat insect larvae and algae. Herbivorous fish eat the algae and zooplankton, and then herbivorous invertebrates are eaten by gar. Another food chain would be algae are eaten by herbivorous invertebrates and other carnivorous fish eat them, then they are eaten by the gar. Gar do not have many predators, only carnivorous fish would eat them, mainly at an early life stage. Gar are a main predator in the aquatic food chain in lakes and rivers. The fish would compete with other carnivorous fish such as the bowfin (Amia calva). In one study, most <b>spotted</b> <b>gar</b> were shoreline oriented, preferred submerged branches as cover, and avoided areas of exposed bank. [...] During a flood pulse, a floodplain provides habitat for spawning and nursery habitat for gar eggs. Movement rates were higher during the summer than during the fall and winter, and rates were greater at night than at dawn during both seasons. The temperature greatly affects their moving rates {{and their ability to}} range their home turf. When the water is warmer during the spring and summer, they travel more often than during the cold seasons. Spotted gars eat 70% of their food intake at night compared to dusk and dawn. Abiotic factors that affect the <b>spotted</b> <b>gar</b> by humans include destruction of habitat and increased sedimentation in the water. In 2002, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, Office of Water Resources, in coordination with the US Environmental Protection Agency, took fish tissue samples in the Lower Mississippi River to test for heavy metals and organic compounds. <b>Spotted</b> <b>gar</b> was found to be a cancer risk with high concentrations of heavy metals and organic compounds.|$|E
50|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>gar</b> is {{native to}} North America and its current range is from {{southern}} Ontario to the west from the Nueces River in Texas east to the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico and southeast to the lower Apalachicola River in Florida.

The gar is more common in the southern waters like the Mississippi River basin from southern Minnesota to Alabama and western Florida. Historical records indicate the <b>spotted</b> <b>gar</b> resided in the Thames and Sydenham Rivers in Ontario, Canada. Also, the fish was once common in Illinois in the Green and Illinois Rivers to the swamps in Union County; though sporadic, the population has dwindled in these water systems because of the loss of specific habitat they need to live, clear pools with aquatic vegetation.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the lake}} there are populations of Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Longnose Gar, Muskie, Northern Pike, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, <b>Spotted</b> <b>Gar,</b> Walleye, and Yellow Perch.

50|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>gar</b> {{is a part}} of the gar family (Lepisosteidae). They are {{notable for}} beingone of the few extant fish species with ganoid scales. They have been known to {{hybridize}} with (and look similar to) Florida gar. It occurs in quiet, clear pools and backwaters of lowland creeks, small to large rivers, oxbow lakes, swamps, and sloughs. It occasionally enters brackish waters.The fish is a voracious predator, feeding on various kinds of fishes and crustaceans. The lifespan for L. oculatus varies between males and females. The maximum lifespan for a gar is 18 years. Males mature at the age of two or three, whereas females mature at three or four years old. Females on average are known to be larger and live longer than the males. Females also have less annual mortality rates.|$|E
50|$|The lake is very shallow, {{about three}} feet (1 m) deep {{throughout}} most the lake. There is however one deep spot, about 54.5 feet (16 m) deep, due to dredging for sand in years past. The lake is annually drained in part to provide shorebird habitat. At least 287 bird species have been found at this lake, which includes most of the species found statewide. Canada geese winter here, as well as bald eagles. Other prominent birds include the mallard duck, snowy egret and little blue heron, and the Eurasian tree sparrow, limited to this region in North America. Fish species include bluegill, sunfish, shortnose gar, <b>spotted</b> <b>gar,</b> crappie, largemouth bass and channel catfish.

5000|$|Shortnose gar have a prehistoric-looking appearance. Like {{many other}} [...] "lie-in-wait" [...] predators, {{they have an}} {{elongated}}, torpedo-like body with an elongated head containing one row of sharp, conical teeth. Similar to many Paleozoic and Mesozoic actinopterygians, their bodies are covered in rows of interlocking, rhomboidal ganoid scales that create an exceptionally protective, yet flexible armor around the fish. [...] The dorsal fin is located posterior nearly directly above the anal fin and very near the large caudal fin. Shortnose gar vary in color, changing from brown/olive green on the dorsal surface to yellow on the sides and white on the underbelly. Shortnose gar can be discerned from other gar species in that they lack the upper jaw of the alligator gar, the long snout of the longnose gar, and the markings of the <b>spotted</b> <b>gar.</b> The shortnose gar reaches up to 88 cm, but a more common length is 62.5 cm.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spotted</b> <b>gar</b> spawn in {{the spring}} in April, May, and June, or when the water {{temperature}} is between , depending on the location. Gar spawn in shallow water with abundant vegetation and cover. The spawning season occurs from April to May. A female can have multiple mating partners and the female is usually larger than the males with which it is mating. The number of eggs the female lays can vary up to about 20,000 eggs, but on average about 13,000 eggs are laid. They lay their eggs on leaves of aquatic plants. The eggs are green in color and have an adhesive coating to keep them attached to aquatic vegetation. After 10 to 14 days, the eggs hatch. At this stage, the gar are most vulnerable. Also, shallow water is preferred, about 0-1 m in depth. Males mature {{at the age of}} two or three, whereas females mature at three or four years old. The male’s average lifespan is 8 years and the female’s average lifespan is 10 years. Females have lower annual mortality rates. The maximum lifespan for a gar is 18 years.|$|E

To determine if edge populations {{are more likely to be}} listed as at risk, fish species were grouped based on whether they are listed as at risk in Canada then assigned values for several life history and ecological traits and a discriminant function analysis was conducted. Conservation status was correctly predicted 93 % of the time. Traits that predicted conservation status were endemic distribution, recognized distinct populations, edge distributions and long-lived. Northern edge populations of <b>Spotted</b> <b>Gar</b> (Lepisosteus oculatus) were investigated for the presence of local adaptations. Adaptations in the form of delayed age at maturity and lower body condition were seen in the Rondeau Bay population of <b>Spotted</b> <b>Gar.</b> Differences in habitat selection and offshore distance were also seen in the Rondeau Bay population when compared to southern core populations of the species. Microsatellite analyses showed that northern edge populations were divergent from southern core populations and the Rondeau Bay population carried the entirety of the genetic diversity found in the north. A phylogeny based on mitochondrial gene sequences was created and used to identify five commercially obtained gar samples. Four individuals obtained at a pet shop in Kitchener, Ontario, labeled as <b>Spotted</b> <b>Gar,</b> were identified as Florida Gar (Lepisosteus platyrhincus).

40|$|Comparative {{functional}} genomic studies {{require the}} proper identification of gene orthologs to properly exploit animal biomedical research models. To identify gene orthologs, comprehensive, conserved gene synteny analyses {{are necessary to}} unwind gene histories that are convoluted by two rounds of early vertebrate genome duplication, {{and in the case}} of the teleosts, a third round, the teleost genome duplication (TGD). Recently, the genome of the <b>spotted</b> <b>gar,</b> a holostean outgroup to the teleosts that did not undergo this third genome duplication, was sequenced and applied as an orthology bridge to facilitate the identification of teleost orthologs to human genes and to enhance the power of teleosts as biomedical models. In this study, we apply the <b>spotted</b> <b>gar</b> orthology bridge to help describe the gene history of the vertebrate TNFAIP 8 family. Members of the TNFAIP 8 gene family have been linked to regulation of immune function and homeostasis and the development of multiple cancer types. Through a conserved gene synteny analysis, we identified zebrafish orthologs to human TNFAIP 8 L 1 and TNFAIP 8 L 3 genes and two co-orthologs to human TNFAIP 8 L 2, but failed to identify an ortholog to human TNFAIP 8. Through the application of the orthology bridge, we determined that teleost orthologs to human TNFAIP 8 genes were likely lost in a genome inversion event after their divergence from their common ancestor with <b>spotted</b> <b>gar.</b> These findings demonstrate the value of this enhanced approach to gene history analysis and support the development of teleost models to study complex questions related to an array of biomedical issues, including immunity and cancer...|$|E

The slowly evolving gar genome has conserved in content and size many entire chromosomes from bony vertebrate ancestors. Gar bridges teleosts to tetrapods by illuminating {{the evolution of}} immunity, mineralization and development (mediated, for example, by Hox, ParaHox and microRNA genes). Numerous conserved noncoding elements (CNEs; often cis regulatory) undetectable in direct human-teleost comparisons become apparent using gar: functional studies uncovered conserved roles for such cryptic CNEs, facilitating annotation of sequences identified in human genome-wide association studies. Transcriptomic analyses showed that the sums of expression domains and expression levels for duplicated teleost genes often approximate the patterns and levels of expression for gar genes, consistent with subfunctionalization.

The shortnose gar (SNG), L. oculatus, is restricted to larger tributaries and rivers in the eastern half of Oklahoma. A similar distribution was indicated for the longnose gar (LNG), L. osseus. The Atlas of North American Freshwater Fishes (2) shows a similar distribution for gar within the state. Beginning in the early 1970 s, we established a biannual fish sampling program for streams and lakes in the Panhandle and northwestern Oklahoma (Harper and Woodward Counties).

40|$|Deorphanization of GPR 54 {{receptor}} {{a decade}} ago led to the characterization of the kisspeptin receptor (Kissr) in mammals and the discovery of its {{major role in the}} brain control of reproduction. While a single gene encodes for Kissr in eutherian mammals including human, other vertebrates present a variable number of Kissr genes, from none in birds, one or two in teleosts, to three in an amphibian, xenopus. In order to get more insight into the evolution of Kissr gene family, we investigated the presence of Kissr in osteichthyans of key-phylogenetical positions: the coelacanth, a representative of early sarcopterygians, the <b>spotted</b> <b>gar,</b> a non-teleost actinopterygian, and the European eel, a member of an early group of teleosts (elopomorphs).

40|$|Opn 5 {{is a group}} {{within the}} opsin family of {{proteins}} {{that is responsible for}} visual and non-visual photoreception in animals. It consists of several subgroups, including Opn 5 m, the only subgroup containing members found in most vertebrates, including mammals. In addition, recent genomic information has revealed that some ray-finned fishes carry paralogous genes of Opn 5 m while other fishes have no such genes. Here, we report the molecular properties of the opsin now called Opn 5 m 2 and its distributions in both the retina and brain. Like Opn 5 m, Opn 5 m 2 exhibits UV light-sensitivity when binding to 11 -cis-retinal and forms a stable active state that couples with Gi subtype of G protein. However, Opn 5 m 2 does not bind all-trans-retinal and exhibits exclusive binding to 11 -cis-retinal, whereas many bistable opsins, including fish Opn 5 m, can bind directly to all-trans-retinal as well as 11 -cis-retinal. Because medaka fish has lost the Opn 5 m 2 gene from its genome, we compared the tissue distribution patterns of Opn 5 m in medaka fish, zebrafish, and <b>spotted</b> <b>gar,</b> in addition to the distribution patterns of Opn 5 m 2 in zebrafish and <b>spotted</b> <b>gar.</b> Opn 5 m expression levels showed a gradient along the dorsal-ventral axis of the retina, and preferential expression was observed in the ventral retina in the three fishes. The levels of Opn 5 m 2 showed a similar gradient with preferential expression observed in the dorsal retina. Opn 5 m expression was relatively abundant in the inner region of the inner nuclear layer, while Opn 5 m 2 was expressed in {{the outer edge of the}} inner nuclear layer. Additionally, we could detect Opn 5 m expression in several brain regions, including the hypothalamus, of these fish species. Opn 5 m 2 expression could not be detected in zebrafish brain, but was clearly observed in limited brain regions of <b>spotted</b> <b>gar.</b> These results suggest that ray-finned fishes can generally utilize UV light information for non-image-forming photoreception in a wide range of cells in the retina and brain...|$|E
40|$|Genome duplication, {{thought to}} have {{happened}} twice early in vertebrate evolution and a third time in teleost fishes, gives rise to gene paralogs that can evolve subfunctions or neofunctions via sequence and regulatory changes. To explore the evolution and functions of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), we searched sequenced teleost genomes for CRH paralogs. Our phylogenetic and synteny analyses indicate that two CRH genes, crha and crhb, evolved via duplication of crh 1 early in the teleost lineage. We examined the expression of crha and crhb in two teleost species from different orders: an African cichlid, Burton’s mouthbrooder, (Astatotilapia burtoni; Order Perciformes) and zebrafish (Danio rerio; Order Cypriniformes). Furthermore, we compared expression of the teleost crha and crhb genes with the crh 1 gene of an outgroup to the teleost clade: the <b>spotted</b> <b>gar</b> (Lepisosteus oculatus). In situ hybridization for crha and crhb mRNA in brains and eyes revealed distinct expression patterns for crha in different teleost species.

In zebrafish, however, crha mRNA was not found in the retina, but was detected in the brain, restricted to the ventral hypothalamus. <b>Spotted</b> <b>gar</b> crh 1 was found in the retina as well as the brain, suggesting that the ancestor of teleost fishes likely had a crh 1 gene expressed in both retina and brain.

Genomic information representing a fish lineage that diverged before the teleost genome duplication (TGD) would provide an outgroup for exploring the mechanisms of evolution after whole-genome duplication. We exploited massively parallel DNA sequencing to develop meiotic maps with thrift and speed by genotyping F 1 offspring of a single female and a single male <b>spotted</b> <b>gar</b> (Lepisosteus oculatus) collected directly from nature utilizing only polymorphisms existing in these two wild individuals. Using Stacks, software that automates the calling of genotypes from polymorphisms assayed by Illumina sequencing, we constructed a map containing 8406 markers.

We identified four Kissr in the <b>spotted</b> <b>gar</b> and coelacanth genomes, providing the first evidence of four Kissr genes in vertebrates. We also found three Kiss in the coelacanth and elephant shark genomes revealing two new species, in addition to Xenopus, presenting three Kiss genes. Considering the increasing diversity of kisspeptin system, phylogenetic and synteny analyses enabled us to clarify both Kiss and Kissr classifications. We also could trace back the evolution of both gene families from the early steps of vertebrate history. Four Kissr and four Kiss paralogs may have arisen via the two whole genome duplication rounds (1 R & 2 R) in early vertebrates. This would have been followed by multiple independent Kiss and Kissr gene losses in the sarcopterygian and actinopterygian lineages. In particular, no impact of the teleost-specific 3 R could be recorded on the numbers of teleost Kissr or Kiss paralogs. The origin of their diversity via 1 R & 2 R, as well as the subsequent occurrence of multiple gene losses, represent common features of the evolutionary histories of Kiss and Kissr families in vertebrates. In contrast, comparisons also revealed un-matching numbers of Kiss and Kissr genes in some species, as well as a large variability of Kiss/Kissr couples according to species. These discrepancies support independent features of the Kiss and Kissr evolutionary histories across vertebrate radiation...|$|E

These cis-regulatory elements are hypothesized to regulate wnt 1 and wnt 10 b transcription both spatially and temporally. A secreted signaling molecule is encoded by wnt 1 that is first expressed in the presumptive midbrain region of the neural plate and is essential for midbrain and hindbrain development. An understanding of wnt regulation would, therefore, shed light on transcriptional mechanisms that underlay regional organization of the vertebrate CNS. In mice {{it has been shown}} that certain non-coding regions work as enhancer elements and trigger the full wnt 1 expression in the early murine embryo. These enhancers are proved to be both necessary and sufficient component of endogenous regulatory machinery of wnt 1 expression. The wnt 1 and wnt 10 b locus in fish shows many conserved non-coding regions. As compared to <b>spotted</b> <b>gar</b> (Lepisosteus oculatus), zebrafish underwent an additional round of whole-genome duplication but these cis-regulatory regions have still been conserved. That indicates they might be of key importance in regulating wnt 1 and wnt 10 b during brain development. There is a possibility that these regions represent an evolutionarily conserved regulatory module controlling the wnt 1 and wnt 10 b expression. This project targets a comparative sequence analysis of non-coding regions from zebrafish and <b>spotted</b> <b>gar</b> to check their ability to activate reporter gene expression in zebrafish midbrain and midbrain-hindbrain boundary. Our goal is to understand the transcriptional regulation of wnt in detail. ECRs are critical in understanding the regulation of wnt genes around midbrain hindbrain boundary. Overall, this study helped us to better understand the role of wnt in anterior posterior patterning in vertebrates as wells as complex control of brain development...|$|E

40|$|Tissue {{samples from}} <b>spotted</b> <b>gar</b> (Lepisosteus oculatus) and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) were {{collected}} from Caddo Lake. Gar and bass livers were subjected to histological investigation and color analysis. Liver color (as abs at 400 nm) was significantly correlated with total mercury in the liver (r 2 = 0. 57, p = 0. 02) and muscle (r 2 = 0. 58, p = 0. 01) of gar. Evidence of liver damage as lipofuscin and discoloration was found in both species but only correlated with liver mercury concentration in <b>spotted</b> <b>gar.</b> Inorganic mercury was the predominant form in gar livers. In {{order to determine the}} role of mercury speciation in fish liver damage, a laboratory feeding study was employed. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were fed either a control (0. 12 ± 0. 002 µg Hg. g- 1 dry wt), inorganic mercury (5. 03 ± 0. 309 µg Hg. g- 1 dry wt), or methylmercury (4. 11 ± 0. 146 µg Hg. g- 1 dry wt) diet. After 78 days of feeding, total mercury was highest in the carcass of zebrafish fed methylmercury (12. 49 ± 0. 369 µg Hg. g- 1 dry wt), intermediate in those fed inorganic mercury (1. 09 ± 0. 117 µg Hg. g- 1 dry wt), and lowest in fish fed the control diet (0. 48 ± 0. 038 µg Hg. g- 1 dry wt). Total mercury was highest in the viscera of methylmercury fed zebrafish (11. 6 ± 1. 86 µg Hg. g- 1 dry wt), intermediate in those fed inorganic diets (4. 3 ± 1. 08 µg Hg. g- 1 dry wt), and lowest in the control fish (below limit of detection). Total mercury was negatively associated with fish length and weight in methylmercury fed fish. Condition factor was not associated with total mercury and might not be the best measure of fitness for these fish. No liver pathologies were observed in zebrafish from any treatment...|$|E
40|$|To connect {{human biology}} to fish {{biomedical}} models, we sequenced the genome of <b>spotted</b> <b>gar</b> (Lepisosteus oculatus), whose lineage diverged from teleosts before teleost genome duplication (TGD). The slowly evolving gar genome has conserved in content and size many entire chromosomes from bony vertebrate ancestors. Gar bridges teleosts to tetrapods by illuminating {{the evolution of}} immunity, mineralization and development (mediated, for example, by Hox, ParaHox and microRNA genes). Numerous conserved noncoding elements (CNEs; often cis regulatory) undetectable in direct human-teleost comparisons become apparent using gar: functional studies uncovered conserved roles for such cryptic CNEs, facilitating annotation of sequences identified in human genome-wide association studies. Transcriptomic analyses showed that the sums of expression domains and expression levels for duplicated teleost genes often approximate the patterns and levels of expression for gar genes, consistent with subfunctionalization. The gar genome provides a resource for understanding evolution after genome duplication, the origin of vertebrate genomes and the function of human regulatory sequences...|$|E
40|$|Several whole genome {{duplication}} (WGD) events {{followed by}} rediploidization {{took place in}} the evolutionary history of vertebrates. Acipenserids represent a convenient model group for investigation of the consequences of WGD as their representatives underwent additional WGD events in different lineages resulting in ploidy level variation between species, and these processes are still ongoing. Earlier, we obtained a set of sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus) chromosome-specific libraries by microdissection and revealed that they painted two or four pairs of whole sterlet chromosomes, as well as additional chromosomal regions, depending on rediploidization status and chromosomal rearrangements after genome duplication. In this study, we employed next generation sequencing to estimate the content of libraries derived from different paralogous chromosomes of sterlet. For this purpose, we aligned the obtained reads to the <b>spotted</b> <b>gar</b> (Lepisosteus oculatus) reference genome to reveal syntenic regions between these two species having diverged 360 Mya. We also showed that the approach is effective for synteny prediction at various evolutionary distances and allows one to clearly distinguish paralogous chromosomes in polyploid genomes. We postulated that after the acipenserid-specific WGD sterlet karyotype underwent multiple interchromosomal rearrangements, but different chromosomes were involved in this process unequally...|$|E
40|$|Prey capture in the <b>spotted</b> <b>gar,</b> Lepisosteus oculatus, was {{studied by}} {{high-speed}} cinematography synchronized with electromyographic recordings of cranial muscle activity. Muscle activity patterns were recorded during {{each of the}} three major phases of feeding: the initial strike at the prey, manipu-lation of the prey following capture, and swallowing. With one exception, the obliquus superioris, all muscles at the strike are active in a bilaterally symmetrical pattern. During the manipulation phase two distinct muscle activity patterns occur: one is characterized by symmetrical activity in the epaxial muscles and obliquus inferioris, the other by complete asymmetry between the right and left sternohyoideus, obliquus superioris, and epaxial muscles. Low-amplitude manipulatory movements are characterized by activity in one side of the sternohyoideus only, all other muscles being generally inactive. The adductor mandibulae and obliquus inferioris are always active symmetrically. Asymmetrical activity in the sternohyoideus, epaxial muscles, and obliquus superioris correlates with lateral head move-ments during feeding and acts to rotate prey into the preferred orientation for swallowing. The pattern of asymmetrical activity between right and left side muscles is discussed in relation to previous studies of feeding which utilized only unilateral muscle recordings...|$|E
40|$|Dawson (1) listed 1498 teratologies of fish, {{but only}} one {{deformity}} of the jaw {{of a member of}} the genus Lepisosteus. Kroger and Guthrie (2) described a longnose gar (L. osseus) with "a crooked lower jaw which had grown slower than the upper jaw " and speculated that an angler has mutilated this fish. At 0335 on 8 May 1984, while bowfishing in shallow, well vegetated water {{at the north end of}} Lake Lawtonka 5. 5 km east and 0. 8 km south of Meers in Comanche County, southwestern Oklahoma, I shot a male <b>spotted</b> <b>gar</b> (Lepisosteus oculatus) that had a lower mandible that was rigidly fixed at a 90 ° angle downward from the upper mandible (Fig. 1). At the time it was collected, the gar was cruising leisurely in 22 °C water about 20 cm deep that was well shaded by erect smartweeds (Polygonum sp.). Its behavior was not erratic or atypical and its appearance, other than the jaw, was normal. The fish weighed 467 g and its total length was 545 mm. These values are near the average weight (472 g) and length (508 mm) of 118 male spotted gars collected from Lake Lawtonka betwee...|$|E
