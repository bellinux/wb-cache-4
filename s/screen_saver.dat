25|$|A {{screensaver}} (or <b>screen</b> <b>saver)</b> is {{a computer}} program that blanks the screen or fills it with moving images or patterns when the computer is not in use. The original purpose of screensavers was to prevent phosphor burn-in on CRT and plasma computer monitors (hence the name). Though modern monitors are not susceptible to this issue, screensavers are still used for other purposes. Screensavers are often set up to offer a basic layer of security, by requiring a password to re-access the device. Some screensavers use the otherwise unused computer resources to do useful work, such as processing for distributed computing projects.|$|E

Josh Spiegel of Movie Mezzanine also echoed these feelings, saying that the film [...] "stumbles because the people involved aren't willing to fully commit to either making a near-shot-for-shot remake or going in a completely different direction". Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald felt that the movie was soulless, writing that [...] "The better these talking beasts look, the more the film resembles a gorgeous <b>screen</b> <b>saver.</b> You admire The Jungle Book, but you can't lose yourself in it".|$|E
