50|$|<b>Spine</b> <b>cars,</b> trailer on flat car, or {{piggy back}} cars allow two 28.5 ft trailer pups or one {{semi-trailer}} up to 57 ft to be carried. They usually come in articulated sets of 5 or 3.|$|R
2500|$|It is {{also common}} in North America to {{transport}} semi-trailers on railway flatcars or <b>spine</b> <b>cars,</b> an arrangement called [...] "piggyback" [...] or TOFC (trailer on flatcar) to {{distinguish it from}} container on flatcar (COFC). Some flatcars are designed with collapsible trailer hitches {{so they can be}} used for trailer or container service. Such designs allow trailers to be rolled on from one end, though lifting trailers on and off flatcars by specialized loaders is more common. TOFC terminals typically have large areas for storing trailers pending loading or pickup.|$|R

40|$|In medical {{point of}} view study of whole-body {{vibration}} is very important because whole-body vibrations (WBV) has adverse e ects on ride comfort and human health. Major back pain problems arises due to long term exposure to vibration, also it can induce degenerate changes in lumber spine. ISO 2631 - 5 : 2004 is {{used to evaluate the}} e ect of long-term exposure to the WBV on human health. It de nes a method of quantifying whole-body vibration containing multiple shocks (such as bumpy rides) in relation to human health. It uses peak vibration (shock) values to predict compression stress in the spine, and reports equivalent daily static compression dose, S ed. The results show high S ed values with high health risks even at low speeds. Therefore to invistigate the e ect of whole body vibration on human body a two dimentional combined multibody model of half car and human body is build which allows the determination of joint reaction forces at each body joint and adverse e ect of whole body vibration on human <b>spine.</b> Half <b>car</b> model consist of sprung mass, unsprung mass and spring-damper(suspension). Half car model has four degrees of freedom. Human hody model consists of rigid bodies which represent major human body segments and structured as linked open-tree multibody system. For vertical excitation speed hump of various pro les are used. Various models of human body and half car are used to study the e ect of WBV on human body. The intensity of WBV is reduced by seat inclination...|$|R
40|$|Our {{backbone}} {{is traditionally}} {{the core and}} the guar-dian of our communications system. Built round the notochord and incorporating possibly still antigenic fragments of this archaic structure, dating back mil-lions ofyears {{to the development of}} vertebrates in the littoral zones, the backbone is a supporting structure with forward-going, bilateral symmetry, a front and a back, a top and a bottom, and a left and a right, a witness to the past and also {{at the same time a}} firm basis for future progress (if we knew where we were going). Our spine is living evidence of our evolutio-nary vicissitudes and our determination to survive future ones, despite pollution, pullulation, politi-cians, profligacy, and last but not least ourselves.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Whiplash is a neck injury caused by the sudden differential movement between the head and torso. Whiplash injuries are most commonly reported {{as a consequence of}} rear impacts in car accidents. They are regarded as minor injuries, but can still lead to long-term disablement and discomfort in the neck. Whiplash injuries can be mitigated by better car seat designs. For this purpose, head restraint geometry must be improved first, and then the dynamic performance of the whole seat must be assessed at all crash seventies. A biofidelic human-body model is a key requirement in designing whiplash mitigating car seats. This thesis presents the development of a 50 th percentile male multi-body human model and several energy absorbing car seat designs. The human-body model is specifically designed for rear impact and validated using the responses of seven volunteers from Japanese Automobile Research Institute (JARI) sled tests, which were performed at an impact speed of 8 kph with a rigid seat and without head restraint and seat belt. A generic multi-body car seat model is also developed to implement various seatback and recliner properties, anti-whiplash devices (A WDs) and head restraints. Using the same driving posture and the rigid seat in the JARI sled tests as the basic configuration, several anti-whiplash seats are designed to allow different types of motion for the seatback and seat-pan. The major findings of this research are: -The human-body model simulates the effects of muscle contraction and its overall response is superior in comparison to the currently used models and dummies. -A criterion called the S-shape index (SSI) is developed based on the intervertebral angles of the upper and lower cervical <b>spine.</b> -The <b>car</b> seat design concepts are able to control and use crash energy effectively with the aid of anti-whiplash devices {{for a wide range of}} crash seventies. -In order to reduce whiplash injury risk, this study advocates energy absorbing car seats which can also provide head restraint contact as early as possible...|$|R
40|$|The last decade's {{improvements}} in automotive safety resulted into {{a significant decrease}} of fatal injuries. However, due {{to the use of}} belts and airbags it can be observed that cervical spine injuries, non-severe and severe, have become more important. It seems that inertial loading of the neck by the head is an important loading mechanism causing these injuries. Until now local deformations and load paths in the cervical spine can not be determined accurately from cadaver experiments {{due to the lack of}} adequate measuring techniques. At this moment the loads at the occipital condyles can be estimated by analyzing high-speed film and the linear and angular accelerations of the head. These loads show a correlation with (local) cervical <b>spine</b> injuries in <b>car</b> crashes. The head-neck response, the neck loads and the sustained injuries obtained from human cadaver experiments in the frontal, lateral and rear-end collisions were investigated to increase the knowledge of the traumatomechanics of the cervical spine. The severity of these experiments, e. g., sled deceleration, varies from 11 to 15 g for frontal, and 7 g for rear-end collisions; for lateral impacts, the shoulder was accelerated with 100 to 130 g through the intruded side wall of the car. It was observed, that rotational accelerations of 1000 rad/sec²do not lead to recognizable injuries during postmortem loadings, while rotational accelerations of 2000 - 3000 rad/sec²or bending moments of 80 - 100 Nm can lead to injuries of ligaments, intervertebral discs and compression fractures of vertebral bodies. Shear forces in frontal collisions of 1000 - 1500 N at the level of the occipital condyles cause strength of the joints in this region. The resultant acceleration at the head center of gravity varies from 20 to 45 g...|$|R
