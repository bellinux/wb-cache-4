5|$|The Great Red <b>Spot,</b> <b>a</b> {{prominent}} oval-shaped {{feature in}} the southern hemisphere of Jupiter, may have been observed as early as 1664 by Robert Hooke and in 1665 by Cassini, although this is disputed.

5|$|The visible {{scars from}} the impacts {{could be seen}} on Jupiter for many months.

5|$|Lee made Sally's Beauty <b>Spot,</b> <b>a</b> 12-minute-long {{short film}} {{focusing}} on a mole on her sister's right breast, for a film editing class at NYU in 1990.

The production cost a total of $4,000. Fellow Canadian filmmaker David Weaver described it as sexualizing Sally's body, something that Lee had not intended. The film was first screened at the Festival of Festivals in Toronto. After graduation, Lee spent time as a curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art before returning to Canada.|$|E

5|$|On April 5, 2013, {{during the}} Giants' home opener, Zito held the Cardinals {{scoreless}} over seven shutout innings, earning the 1–0 win. He followed this performance with seven more shutout innings and some personal offensive contribution {{at the plate}} against the Rockies in a 10–0 win to complete a 3-game series sweep. It was the Giants' 16th straight victory {{in a row in}} games started by Zito (including the 2012 regular season and postseason), the longest such streak by a Giants pitcher since 1936 by Hall of Fame left-handed pitcher Carl Hubbell.

5|$|Saturn's usually bland {{atmosphere}} occasionally exhibits long-lived ovals {{and other}} features common on Jupiter. In 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope imaged an enormous white cloud near Saturn's equator that was not present during the Voyager encounters, and in 1994 another smaller storm was observed. The 1990 storm {{was an example of}} a Great White <b>Spot,</b> <b>a</b> unique but short-lived phenomenon that occurs once every Saturnian year, roughly every 30 Earth years, {{around the time of the}} northern hemisphere's summer solstice. Previous Great White Spots were observed in 1876, 1903, 1933 and 1960, with the 1933 storm being the most famous. If the periodicity is maintained, another storm will occur in about 2020.|$|E
5|$|Tests {{were carried}} out {{starting}} in October 1940, and quickly demonstrated a number of minor problems. One of the minor issues is that the crosshairs on the tube that indicated the center would block the <b>spot.</b> <b>A</b> more serious concern {{was the lack of}} range information, which the FIU pilots considered critical. Hanbury Brown went to work on these issues, and returned an updated version in December. A U-shaped reticle {{in the center of the}} display provided a centre location that left the spot visible. Additionally, the circuitry included a second timebase that produced a longer signal as the fighter approached its target. The output was timed so the line was centred horizontally on the dot. This presented the range in an easily understandable fashion; the line looked like the wings of an aircraft, which naturally grow larger as the fighter approaches it.|$|E

The Doctor and Christina <b>spot</b> <b>a</b> sandstorm on the horizon when they are met by two Tritovores, a species resembling anthropomorphic flies, who take them to their wrecked spaceship. They explain they were delivering a shipment to San Helios, which had housed over hundred billion just recently but now is desert wherever they scan. The Doctor has them scan the approaching sandstorm and finds {{it really is a}} swarm of stingray-like aliens that are destroying the ecosystem. He suspects they are generating the wormhole to travel to their next planet to feed upon, and they must hurry and close the wormhole before they can reach Earth. Christina uses her burglary skills to obtain a power crystal and its mounting from the Tritovore ship, but accidentally wakes an alien stingray, which consumes the Tritovores.|$|E
5|$|The EyeTV W was {{introduced}} in November 2013.

5|$|After {{dropping}} the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship {{for a third}} and final time, the Blond Bombers began to challenge for the NWA Mid-America Tag Team Championship. They defeated George Gulas and Ken Lucas to win the belts on December 15, 1979. While holding the title, they continued to feud with Gulas. When they attacked him one day, his estranged partner Bobby Eaton rescued him; Gulas and Eaton reunited as The Jet Set and defeated the Bombers to win the championship. Latham and Farris regained the belts in a rematch against The Jet Set but later dropped them to Rocky Brewer and Pat Rose. The Blond Bombers had one last reign with the Mid-America belts, as they defeated Eaton and Great Togo in July 1980. They held the title until September 3, when they lost a match to Robert Gibson and Don Fargo. After losing the belts, Farris left to compete in Puerto Rico's World Wrestling Council. Upon returning to Tennessee, he found other partners and had two more reigns as an AWA Southern Tag Team Champion.
