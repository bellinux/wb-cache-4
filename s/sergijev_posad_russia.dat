If the non-minimal coupling is large, it relaxes the constraint on the field self coupling, making it possible to use the Standard Model Higgs field as the inflaton. At the same time, even small non-minimal coupling constant, ξ≳ 10 ^- 3, brings the usual inflaton with quartic potential in agreement with the WMAP 5 observations.

To this end, the UV anomalous dimension is calculated at the one-loop order in the light-cone gauge and a consistent treatment of the extra singularities, which produce undesirable contributions in the anomalous dimensions, is given.

40|$|We {{showed that}} the part of strings could be {{detected}} by optical method is only 20 % from the total available amount of such objects, therefore the gravitational lensing method has to be "completed" by CMB one. We found the general structure of the CMB anisotropy generated by a cosmic string for simple model of straight string moving with constant velocity. For strings with deficit angle 1 - 2 arcsec the amplitude of generated anisotropy has to be 15 - 30 muK (the corresponding string linear density is (G mu) ~ 10 ^{- 7 } and energy is GUT one, 10 ^{ 15 } GeV). To use both radio and optical methods the deficit angle has to be from 0. 1 arcsec to 5 - 6 arcsec. If cosmic string can be detected by optical method, the length of corresponding brightness spot of anisotropy has to be no less than 100 degrees.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the coupled channel model the mass shifts of the P [...] wave excitations of D_s and B_s mesons have been calculated. The corresponding coupling to DK and BK channels is provided by the effective chiral Lagrangian which is deduced from QCD and does not contain fitting parameters. The strong mass shifts down for 0 ^+ and 1 ^+' states have been obtained, while 1 ^+" and 2 ^+ states remain almost at rest. Two factors are essential for large mass shifts: strong coupling of the 0 ^+ and 1 ^+' states to the S-wave decay channel, containing a Nambu-Goldstone meson, and the chiral flip transitions due to the bispinor structure of both heavy-light mesons. The masses M(B^*_s(0 ^+)) = 5710 (15) MeV and M(B_s(1 ^+')) = 5730 (15) MeV are predicted. Experimental limit on the width Γ(D_s 1 (2536)) < 2. 3 MeV puts strong restrictions on admittable mixing angle between the 1 ^+ and 1 ^+' states.

40|$|We {{study the}} pair {{production}} of scalar top quarks in e+e- collisions with the subsequent decay {{of the top}} squarks into b-quarks and charginos. We simulate this process using PYTHIA 6. 4 for beam energies 2 E_beam = 350, 400, 500, 800, 1000 GeV. Proposing a set of criteria we obtain a good separation of the signal stop events from top quark pair production which is the main background. The number of stop production events obtained with the proposed cuts for different energies is calculated for an integrated luminosity of 1000 1 /fb.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the highlights {{from the recent}} measurements of the energy spectrum, mass composition, and arrival directions of the ultra-high energy (> 10 ^ 17 eV = 0. 1 EeV) cosmic rays (UHECR) by the Pierre Auger Observatory. The Auger hybrid detector combines fluorescence observations of the longitudinal profiles of extended air showers, initiated by these extremely energetic particles, with measures of the shower secondaries at the ground level by its large array of Cherenkov water tanks. The complementariness of the two techniques provides important cross-checks at the energies unreachable with accelerator experiments. The Pierre Auger experiment has observed a strong steepening of the cosmic ray flux above 40 EeV. A significant anisotropy in the arrival directions of cosmic rays has been established for events above ≃ 60 EeV. These events correlate over angular scales of less than 6 ^∘ with the directions towards nearby (D < 100 Mpc) active galactic nuclei. Both observations {{are consistent with the}} standard scenarios of the UHECR production in the extragalactic astrophysical acceleration sites. The derived stringent upper limits on the photon and neutrino contents in the UHECR are additional important arguments in support of these scenarios. The measurements of the variation of the depth of shower maximum with energy, interpreted with the current hadronic interaction models, favour the mixed cosmic ray composition at energies above 0. 4 EeV. We describe the plans and prospects for the future, that will further help to solve the 50 years old UHECR puzzle. Comment: 13 pages, 5 figures.

In October 2013, Carey was relieved of his command of the 20th Air Force and Task Force (TF) 214 by Lieutenant General James Kowalski, commander of Air Force Global Strike Command, after an examination of Carey's behavior in Moscow conducted by the US Air Force Office of Special Investigations. A delegation member representing the Office of the Secretary of Defense with a first-hand knowledge of the incident, whose name was not revealed, triggered the investigation by reporting it to the superiors. Later, she told the investigators, [...] "I realized that this was putting us all at risk, especially Russia and women, and I just wanted nothing to do with that". The Washington Post wrote that Carey drank excessively during his visit to Russia, and fraternized with foreign women. The New York Times claimed that Carey's behavior during the official meetings was not appropriate, including [...] "interrupting speakers and correcting a Russian translator", and that he was over drinking during the visit, and once attempted to play with a restaurant band. Under the Freedom of Information Act, American journalists filed a request and received a redacted copy of the official Report of Investigations Concerning Major General Michael J. Carey. The report revealed that Carey's behavior was considered by his colleagues as rude toward the Russian hosts during the exercise and related briefings, especially, when he made comments about Syria and Snowden.|$|R
