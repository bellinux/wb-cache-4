5|$|One {{probable}} {{reason for}} the British clergy's refusal {{to cooperate with the}} Gregorian missionaries was the ongoing conflict between the natives and the Anglo-Saxons, who still were encroaching upon British lands {{at the time of the}} mission. The British were unwilling to preach to the invaders of their country, and the invaders saw the natives as second-class citizens, and would have been unwilling to listen to any conversion efforts. There was also a political dimension, as the missionaries could be seen as agents of the invaders; because Augustine was protected by Æthelberht, <b>submitting</b> <b>to</b> Augustine would have been seen as <b>submitting</b> <b>to</b> Æthelberht's authority, which the British bishops would have been unwilling to do.|$|E

5|$|Edmund Rich, the Archbishop of Canterbury, {{intervened in}} 1234 and held several great councils, advising Henry {{to accept the}} {{dismissal}} of des Roches. Henry agreed to make peace, but, before the negotiations were completed, Richard died of wounds suffered in battle, leaving his younger brother Gilbert to inherit his lands. The final settlement was confirmed in May, and Henry was widely praised for his humility in <b>submitting</b> <b>to</b> the slightly embarrassing peace. Meanwhile, the truce with France in Brittany finally expired, and Henry's ally Duke Peter came under fresh military pressure. Henry could only send a small force of soldiers to assist, and Brittany fell to Louis in November. For the next 24 years, Henry ruled the kingdom personally, rather than through senior ministers.|$|E

5|$|Royal {{artisans}} {{were sometimes}} responsible for sculpting stelae; {{in some cases}} these sculptors were actually the sons of kings. In other cases {{it is likely that}} captive artisans from defeated cities were put to work raising stelae for the victors, as evidenced by the sculptural style of one city appearing upon monuments of its conqueror soon after its defeat. This appears to have been the case in Piedras Negras where Stela12 depicting war captives <b>submitting</b> <b>to</b> the victorious king is carved in the style of Pomoná, the defeated city. Archaeologists believe that this may also have been the case with Quiriguá after its surprise defeat of its overlord Copán.|$|E
5|$|The French expedition's two frigates, both only {{partially}} armed, were detached during {{the action and}} took shelter in harbour at Guadeloupe. In June, heavily laden with trade goods, they attempted to escape to Europe, but were pursued by elements of the British blockade force.

5|$|The {{committee}} was divided between radicals and moderates, and narrowly {{passed a resolution}} agreeing {{to submit to the}} government's terms. The popular referendum was held on September 11 and also produced mixed results. Some townships overwhelmingly supported <b>submitting</b> <b>to</b> U.S. law, but opposition to the government remained strong in areas where poor and landless people predominated. The final report of the commissioners recommended the use of the military to enforce the laws. The trend was towards submission, however, and westerners dispatched representatives William Findley and David Redick to meet with Washington and to halt the progress of the oncoming army. Washington and Hamilton declined, arguing that violence was likely to re-emerge if the army turned back.|$|E

5|$|Written by Mike Tucker & Robert Perry, {{this was}} a three-part Cybermen story set in war-torn London of the 1940s.

Fellow writer Ben Aaronovitch intercepted the script, suggesting that <b>submitting</b> <b>to</b> script editor Andrew Cartmel a World War II script when he was currently already editing something similar (The Curse of Fenric) was a mistake and to instead submit it for the following series.

5|$|Æthelwig's {{relationship}} with Wulfstan, when Wulfstan was {{acting as the}} abbot's diocesan bishop, {{appears to have been}} tense, for on the only recorded visitation by Wulfstan to Evesham during Æthelwig's abbacy, Æthelwig was not there. Although in legal matters Wulfstan and Æthelwig were in conflict, personally, Æthelwig is said to have regarded Wulfstan as a father figure, and as the abbot's confessor. The fact that the Evesham's house chronicle appears to have been reworked after 1100 to gloss over embarrassing incidents of the abbots <b>submitting</b> <b>to</b> the bishops of Worcester makes evaluation of Æthelwig's relations with his episcopal superiors more difficult.|$|E
5|$|Athens had {{recently}} become a democracy, overthrowing its own tyrant Hippias. In their fight {{to establish the}} democracy, the Athenians had asked the Persians for aid (which {{was not in the}} end needed), in return for <b>submitting</b> <b>to</b> Persian overlordship. Some years later, Hippias had attempted to regain power in Athens, assisted by the Spartans. This attempt failed and Hippias fled to Artaphernes, and tried to persuade him to subjugate Athens. The Athenians dispatched ambassadors to Artaphernes to dissuade him from taking action, but Artaphernes merely instructed the Athenians to take Hippias back as tyrant. Needless to say, the Athenians had baulked at this, and resolved instead to be openly at war with Persia. Since they were already an enemy of Persia, Athens was already in a position to support the Ionian cities in their revolt. The fact that the Ionian democracies were inspired by the example of the Athenian democracy no doubt helped persuade the Athenians to support the Ionian Revolt, especially since the cities of Ionia were (supposedly) originally Athenian colonies.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} results between {{recession}} of the lateral recti and monocular recess-resect procedure for the correction {{of the basic}} type of intermittent exotropia. METHODS: 115 patients with intermittent exotropia were <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> surgery. The patients were divided into 4 groups, according to the magnitude of preoperative deviation and the surgical procedure was subsequently performed. Well compensated orthophoria or exo-or esophoria were considered surgical success, with minimum of 1 year follow-up after the operation. RESULTS: Success was obtained in 69 % of the patients <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> recession of the lateral recti, and in 77 % <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> monocular recess-resect. In the groups with deviations between 12 PD and 25 PD, surgical success was observed in 74 % of the patients <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> recession of the lateral recti and in 78 % of the patients <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> monocular recess-resect. (p= 0. 564). In the group with deviations between 26 PD and 35 PD, surgical success was observed in 65 % out of the patients <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> recession of the lateral recti and in 75 % of the patients <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> monocular recess-resect.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the dimensional changes of denture bases made from different resins after different storage periods.
