In the total district, Asian students made up 14% of the student population, and African American and Latino students each made up 36% of the population. The differences in the AIMS schools could be the result of its recruiting practices.|$|E
50|$|The core NCCS design uses {{a sample}} survey {{approach}} {{rather than a}} census of all students. (However, schools will {{have the option to}} conduct a census if they wish.) A randomly selected <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> (undergraduates and graduates) allows the study to make scientifically based inferences to the population as a whole, helps focus finite research resources on successfully contacting and encouraging the participation of the broadest group of students, and reduces survey burden on an often over-surveyed population.|$|E

50|$|Indirect writing {{assessments}} typically {{consist of}} multiple choice tests on grammar, usage, and vocabulary. Examples include high-stakes standardized tests {{such as the}} ACT, SAT, and GRE, which are most often used by colleges and universities for admissions purposes. Other indirect assessments, such as Compass and Accuplacer, are used to place students into remedial or mainstream writing courses. Direct writing assessments, like the timed essay test, require at least one <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>student</b> writing andare viewed by many writing assessment scholars as more valid than indirect tests because they are assessing actual <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> writing. Portfolio assessment, which generally consists of several pieces <b>of</b> <b>student</b> writing written {{over the course of}} a semester, began to replace timed essays during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Portfolio assessment is viewed as being even more valid than timed essay tests because it focuses on multiple <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> <b>student</b> writing that have been composed in the authentic context of the classroom. Portfolios enable assessors to examine multiple <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> <b>student</b> writing and multiple drafts of a single essay.|$|R
5000|$|Portfolio {{assessment}} is typically {{used to assess}} what students have learned {{at the end of}} a course or over a period of several years.

[...] "Showcase portfolios" [...] contain final drafts <b>of</b> <b>student</b> writing, and [...] "process portfolios" [...] contain multiple drafts of each piece of writing. Both print and electronic portfolios can be either showcase or process portfolios, though electronic portfolios typically contain hyperlinks from the reflective essay or letter to <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> <b>student</b> work and, sometimes, outside sources.|$|R

GL Assessment who set the majority of 11+ tests say it should be, “a very large, representative <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> usually across the UK” [...] however grammar schools chose to standardise their tests against just those children who apply {{to them in a}} given year as this enables them to match supply to demand.|$|E
5000|$|The Remote Associates Test (RAT), adult {{form was}} {{originally}} published in 1959, and then again in 1962, by Professor Sarnoff Mednick and Martha T. Mednick. In 1971, Mednick and Mednick published the high school form of the RAT. Mednick and Mednick defined the creative thinking process in the test manual as [...] "the forming of associative elements into new combinations which either meet specified requirements or are in someway useful. The more mutually remote {{the elements of the}} new combination, the more creative the process or solution." [...] Mednick reported a Spearman-Brown reliability of RAT=0.92 in one <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> at an Eastern women’s college, and 0.91 in a sample of men tested at the University of Michigan.|$|E

From 2000 to 2006, SEELS documented the school experiences of a national <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> as they moved from elementary to middle school and from middle to high school. One important feature of SEELS was that it did not look at students' educational, social, vocational, and personal development at a single point in time. Rather, it was designed to assess change in these areas over time.|$|E
40|$|This study {{outlines}} {{and demonstrates}} a methodology for identifying effective schools using a random <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>student</b> data {{generated by the}} operation of a school district's Instructional Accomplishment Information (IAI) system. (IAI systems are designed to provide school districts with information for reviewing and planning their instructional programs at the class, school, and district levels.) This study outlines and demonstrates a methodology for identifying effective schools using a random <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>student</b> data generated by the operation of a school district's IAI system. The particular context chosen for demonstration is that of Racially Isolated Minority Schools (RIMS) in the Los Angeles Unified School District. The study shows that there are substantial instructrbnal accomplishments in black RIM schools but that these accomplishments- not uniformly spread across the schools.

5000|$|The 1% rule {{is often}} {{misunderstood}} {{to apply to}} the Internet in general, but it applies more specifically to any given Internet community. It {{is for this reason that}} one can see evidence for the 1% principle on many websites, but aggregated together one can see a different distribution. This latter distribution is still unknown and likely to shift, but various researchers and pundits have speculated on how to characterize the sum total of participation. Research in late 2012 suggested that only 23% of the population (rather than 90 percent) could properly be classified as lurkers, while 17% of the population could be classified as intense contributors of content. [...] Several years prior, results were reported on a <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> from Chicago where 60 percent of the sample created content in some form.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to physical looks, quality of voice {{has also been}} shown to enhance interpersonal attraction. Oguchi and Kikuchi (1997) had 25 female students from one university rank the level of vocal attraction, physical attraction, and overall interpersonal attraction of 4 male students from another university. Vocal and physical attractiveness had independent effects on overall interpersonal attraction. In a second part of the same study, these results were replicated in a larger <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> for both genders (62 subjects, 20 males and 42 females with 16 target students, 8 males and 8 females). Similarly, Zuckerman, Miyake and Hodgins (1991) found that both vocal and physical attractiveness contributed significantly to observers' ratings of targets for general attractiveness. These results suggest that when people evaluate one's voice as attractive, they also tend to evaluate that person as attractive.|$|E
50|$|The SAEB was {{the first}} {{national}} Brazilian initiative to measure the Brazilian educational system in depth. It {{was developed in the}} late 1980s and was first applied in 1990.

50|$|Other trends {{concerning}} {{sexual health}} in Canadian adolescents involve social factors. Canadian adolescents with the poorest sexual health tend {{to live in}} low-income families, in isolated and rural areas, and in provinces and territories with greater concentrations of rural and aboriginal populations. Adolescents who have sex {{at an earlier age}} tend to have low academic achievement, come from lower-income households, and are born in Canada. Students who had intercourse {{were more likely to have}} friends who did likewise. Boyce and colleagues surveyed a <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> from grades 7, 9, and 11 with the Canadian Youth, Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS Survey and found that the reasons given most for having sex for girls was “love for the person” and for boys was “curiosity and experimentation”. Females were two to three times more likely to report being pressured into having sex, or having unwanted sex.|$|E
50|$|Many {{studies were}} {{completed}} {{to evaluate the}} role of positive affect in the tripartite model. A sample of university students were administered the Positive and Negative Affective Schedule (PANAS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). The {{results of this study}} were congruent with low Positive Affect predicting depression. A longitudinal study was completed with a <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> in grade 6 and later grade 9. The students completed the Baltimore How I Feel (BHIF), a measure of anxious and depressive symptoms. This study confirmed the PA aspect of the tripartite model. A study with a sample of inpatient children/adolescents was consistent with the tripartite model as well. Findings from a study in 2006 of a community sample of youth supported the tripartite in youth and further supported that anxiety and depression do represent unique syndromes in youth based on differences found in positive affect. Many studies looked at samples of youth but studies were also done with older adult samples. A study consisting of psychiatric outpatients, ages 55-87, confirmed that positive affect was significantly more related to depression than anxiety symptoms.|$|E
5000|$|Recent {{research}} {{points at}} substantial {{differences in the}} cognitive styles of liberals and conservatives on psychological measures. For example, conservatives respond to threatening situations with more aggression than do liberals. Similarly, conservatives are more sensitive to threatening facial expressions. Jost and colleagues posed that political orientation is associated with psychological processes for managing fear and uncertainty A 2011 study by cognitive neuroscientist Ryota Kanai's group at University College London published in Current Biology, found a correlation between differences in political views and differences in brain structures in a convenience <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> from University College London. The researchers performed MRI scans on the brains of 90 volunteer students who had indicated their political orientation on a five-point scale ranging from [...] "very liberal" [...] to [...] "very conservative". Students who reported more [...] "conservative" [...] political views tended to have larger amygdalae, a structure in the temporal lobes that performs a primary role in the processing and memory of emotions. In addition, they found clusters in which gray matter volume {{was significantly associated with}} conservativism in the left insula and the right entorhinal cortex. There is evidence that conservatives are more sensitive to disgust and the insula is involved in the feeling of disgust [...] On the other hand, more 'liberal' students tended to have a larger volume of grey matter in the anterior cingulate cortex, a structure of the brain associated with monitoring uncertainty and handling conflicting information. It is consistent with previous research suggesting that individuals with a larger ACC have a higher capacity to tolerate uncertainty and conflicts, allowing them to accept more liberal viewsThe authors concluded that, [...] "Although our data do not determine whether these regions play a causal role in the formation of political attitudes, they converge with previous work to suggest a possible link between brain structure and psychological mechanisms that mediate political attitudes." [...] In an interview with LiveScience, Ryota Kanai said, [...] "It's very unlikely that actual political orientation is directly encoded in these brain regions", and that, [...] "more work is needed to determine how these brain structures mediate the formation of political attitude." [...] Kanai and colleagues added {{that it is necessary to}} conduct a longitudinal study to determine whether the changes in brain structure that we observed lead to changes in political behavior or whether political attitudes and behavior instead result in changes of brain structure.|$|E
