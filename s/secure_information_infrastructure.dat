40|$|Abstract. Industrial Control Systems (ICS) {{monitor and}} control in-dustrial processes, and enable {{automation}} in industry facilities. Many of these facilities {{are regarded as}} Critical Infrastructures (CIs). Due to {{the increasing use of}} Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) IT products and connectivity offerings, CIs have become an attractive target for cyber-attacks. A successful attack could have significant consequences. An important step in <b>securing</b> Critical <b>Information</b> <b>Infrastructures</b> (CIIs) against cyber-attacks is risk analysis – understanding security risks, based on a systematic analysis of information on vulnerabilities, cyber threats, and the impacts related to the targeted system. Existing risk analysis approaches have various limitations, such as scalability and prac-ticability problems. In contrast to previous work, we propose a practical and vulnerability-centric risk analysis approach for determining security risks associated with advanced, multi-step cyber-attacks. In order to ex-amine multi-step attacks that exploit chains of vulnerabilities, we map vulnerabilities into preconditions and effects, and use rule-based reason-ing for identifying advanced attacks and their path through a CII...|$|R

The {{purpose of the present study}} is to 1) determine the underlying factor structure of a cyber-security behavior scale, 2) assess if individual personality traits predict four types of cyber-security behaviors: security assurance, security compliance, security risk, and security damaging behaviors, and 3) explore the relationship between citizenship and counterproductive work behaviors and cyber-security behaviors. Results indicate that cyber-security behavior can be separated into four distinct dimensions and that personality traits such as conscientiousness, agreeableness, and openness to experience are predictive of these behaviors. Additionally, positive cyber behaviors are related organizational citizenship behaviors, and potentially harmful cyber behaviors related to counterproductive work behaviors. This research has implications for using personality to predict cyber-security behaviors and reduce insider threat in the workplace...|$|R

40|$|The Department of Defense (DoD) current {{strategic}} {{vision is}} to ensure that information superiority is maintained across the full spectrum of operations. Hence, one of the greatest challenges facing this vision is to <b>secure</b> the <b>information</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> Protection of the infrastructure entails the standoff of a myriad of attacks and malicious activity such as denial-of-service, viruses and Trojan horses. A daunting challenge in itself, protection of the infrastructure succeeds only with a strong policy, process, and standard. The current process used to ensure protection is the DoD Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP). It is currently being revised to the DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP). This thesis analyzes current and past applications of the DITSCAP to evaluate successes and failures. Due to the large number of personnel who use the process and the astronomical cost associated with traveling to each of their commands, the method selected to obtain data for analysis was a survey and phone interviews. The survey was web-based and the link was emailed to personnel who use the process. The objective of this thesis is to provide recommendations for improving the process that should be considered in developing the DIACAP. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|Recent work on {{information}} systems has discussed {{the nature and}} {{the complexity of the}} <b>Information</b> <b>Infrastructures</b> (II) concept. This research has mainly focused on two aspects: studying the process that both shapes and stabilizes <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> and studying the role played by <b>information</b> <b>infrastructure</b> in leveraging business performance. Using the ideas proposed by the Actor Network Theory (ANT), this article suggests a new way to conceptualise the nature of II, that is, its ontology. Using ANT as an ontological foundation to analyse the relations among actors, the article proposes the concept of <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures</b> in action to highlight their dynamic nature. This leads us to consider <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures</b> not as stable entities, but rather as entities performed in, by, and through relations. The aim of this work is to overcome the limitations associated with studying <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures</b> that rely on stability and manageability assumptions. Conceiving <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures</b> in terms of performative forces that evolve dynamically, this work provides a framework to examine <b>information</b> <b>infrastructure</b> in terms of dynamic relationships by looking at the process that shapes these relationships.
