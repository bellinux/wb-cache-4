5|$|Court-show viewers don't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> moral conundrums or {{technical}} wrinkles. They love Sheindlin's show because she offers them a fantasy of how they'd like {{the justice system}} to operate—swiftly, and without procedural mishaps or uppity lawyers. They get to see wrongdoers publicly humiliated by a strong authority figure. There is no uncertainty after Sheindlin renders her verdict and bounds off the bench, and there certainly are no lengthy appeals.|$|E
25|$|The {{new record}} is coming along great! The new jams are high energy, and are gonna be a blast to play live. We're working on really using all three vocals, which {{we used to}} do a bit more in the early days and works great, and people always <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> more of, so that will be fun. But mostly I expect a great Dillinger Four record: fun, fast-paced, great change-ups and a couple songs on this one where it's a bit {{different}} than stuff we've done before.|$|E
25|$|Some locals in {{the area}} support some kind of {{independence}} from Thailand; others clearly do not. This was shown by the national referendum to support the junta-backed constitution for Thailand, which was favoured by a majority in all three southernmost provinces and passed overwhelmingly in the southern region of Thailand, with 87% of the 3.7 million voters who participated there approving it. Furthermore, while those in the insurgent groups support armed conflict, most southern residents <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> negotiation and compromise {{and the rule of}} law to return, along with an end to human rights abuses by both sides.|$|E

25|$|Ebony {{tries to}} make a deal with the Technos' general, Jay, in order to hold a little power in the city. Ellie, blaming Ebony for Jack's capture, {{attempts}} to kill her and is sent away to a labour camp. The Technos <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to bring progress and order to the city. However, in secret, their leader, Ram, is experimenting a new virtual game on people with the help of Jay's brother, Ved. Ved starts a relationship with Mall Rat Cloe but when she tells him she is pregnant, he immediately dumps her. Amber becomes unwillingly addicted to the game and realises the Technos must be stopped. She asks an initially reluctant Cloe to get information from Ved, but Cloe later agrees, getting Ved drunk and taking advantage of him by receiving the password for his computer. Ebony reluctantly agrees to marry Ram, but ends up betraying him and escapes the city with Jay, who has come to realise what Ram's real plans are. Cloe becomes addicted to reality space and whilst playing the game, vanishes. Ved is distraught as he actually loved her. He fights Ram in reality space to get her back but loses and is later deleted. The Mall Rats succeed in defeating Ram by imprisoning him in virtual reality, with the help of Ram's lieutenant, Mega.|$|E

[...] Breyfogle continued, [...] "It has some diehard fans. But, DC doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to do anything with him. Maybe it's because of his anti-authoritarian philosophy, a very touchy subject in today's world." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Death" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The episode, along with the Terrance and Phillip show, were inspired by early criticism that South Park was little more than flatulence jokes and primitive animation. The script portrays the parents as so invested in protesting television programs, they fail to pay any attention to what is actually going on in their children's lives. They <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to make television clean and wholesome so the entertainment industry can raise their kids so they themselves don't have to make the time and effort to be full-time parents. The episode also advocates against censorship and addresses the morality and ethics of euthanasia.|$|E

He finds that people do not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to speak about the General when asked, only commenting on {{achievements}} of the [...] "wonderfully inventive age" [...] and how [...] "horrid" [...] the Native Americans whom the General had fought against had been. The narrator begins to believe there is some concealed secret he must uncover.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{point out}} that this theory fails to explain when, how, why or by whom [...] "obligatory {{reciprocal}} altruism" [...] could possibly have been enforced. Various proposals have been offered to remedy this defect. A further criticism is that language doesn't work on the basis of reciprocal altruism anyway. Humans in conversational groups don't withhold information to all except listeners likely to offer valuable information in return. On the contrary, they <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to advertise to the world their access to socially relevant information, broadcasting it to anyone who will listen without thought of return.|$|E
2500|$|The first anchor {{store to}} close at Regency Mall was Upton’s, which {{occupied}} the space originally built for Cullum's; its Regency Mall store closed in April 1993. [...] Seven other stores in the mall closed {{by the end of}} that year. [...] Some merchants who were leaving the mall said that the mall wasn’t generating enough traffic to justify remaining at the mall. [...] One said she didn’t see the mall “having any kind of future” the way it was. [...] Another merchant claimed that the mall’s management “doesn’t <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to work with its tenants.” [...] Though some new businesses moved in, some of these were small businesses instead of franchised outlets; for example, a comic book store moved into a vacant store on the second level. [...] However, the mall was steadily becoming deserted.|$|E

2500|$|During the Test, former South African opening batsman Barry Richards bemoaned {{the lack}} of fight in the England team, commenting that [...] "...it puzzles me why {{the new breed of}} England batsmen are failing to stamp their {{authority}} on an innings. People like Stewart and Hick have all the ability at Test level but they do not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to grab the game by the scruff of its [...] neck and say to the opposition bowlers: 'I'm here. Come and get me if you can.'". [...] meanwhile, in The Guardian, Mike Selvey praised the South African seamers, and Scyld Berry singled out Fanie De Villiers' bowling on the second day as the turning point of the match, and the above commentators pointed out England's lack of success at the home of cricket and questioned {{the lack of}} a left-handed batsman in the eleven.|$|E

I'm signing off all the time for TV shows or chocolate bars using it. Sure, have it, it's just a song, do whatever you like with it. You can hear it wasn't written for profit. It's an accidental song I accidentally wrote and accidentally became a single and accidentally became a hit. It's been a nice earner [...] I've written 2000 songs. Thank God one of them came through!

I never see 'Under the Milky Way' – it's so busy out there working..." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film had {{its opening}} premiere on March 2, 1965 at the Rivoli Theater in New York City. Initial reviews were mixed. Bosley Crowther, in The New York Times, criticized the film's [...] "romantic {{nonsense}} and sentiment", the children's [...] "artificial roles", and Robert Wise's [...] "cosy-cum-corny" [...] direction. Judith Crist, in a biting {{review in the}} New York Herald Tribune, dismissed the movie as [...] "icky sticky" [...] and designed for [...] "the five to seven set and their mommies". In her review for McCall's magazine, Pauline Kael called the film [...] "the sugar-coated lie people <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to eat", and that audiences have [...] "turned into emotional and aesthetic imbeciles when we hear ourselves humming the sickly, goody-goody songs". [...] Wise later recalled, [...] "The East Coast, intellectual papers and magazines destroyed us, but the local papers and the trades gave us great reviews." [...] Indeed, reviewers such as Philip K. Scheuer of the Los Angeles Times described the film as [...] "three hours of visual and vocal brilliance", and Daily Variety called it [...] "a warmly-pulsating, captivating drama set to the most imaginative use of the lilting R-H tunes, magnificently mounted and with a brilliant cast". The [...] "wildly mixed film reviews" [...] reflected the critical response to the stage musical, according to The Oxford Companion to the American Musical. After its Los Angeles premiere on March 10, The Sound of Music opened in 131 theaters in the United States, including {{a limited number of}} roadshow events. After four weeks, the film became the number one box office movie in the country, and held that position for thirty out of the next forty-three weeks in 1965. The original theatrical release of the film in America lasted four and a half years.|$|E
