5|$|During the 1980s naval {{versions}} of the AH-64A for the United States Marine Corps and Navy were examined. Multiple concepts were <b>studied</b> <b>with</b> altered landing gear arrangements, improved avionics and weapons.

5|$|Feminism in {{psychology}} {{emerged as a}} critique of the dominant male outlook on psychological research where only male perspectives were <b>studied</b> <b>with</b> all male subjects. As women earned doctorates {{in psychology}}, females and their issues were introduced as legitimate topics of study. Feminist psychology emphasizes social context, lived experience, and qualitative analysis. Projects such as Psychology's Feminist Voices have emerged to catalogue the influence of feminist psychologists on the discipline.|$|E

5|$|He {{moved from}} Florence, South Carolina, to New York City {{at the age}} of 17. Working a variety of jobs, he saved enough money to pay for classes at the prestigious National Academy of Design. He took a preparatory class with Charles Louis Hinton, then <b>studied</b> <b>with</b> Charles Courtney Curran and George Willoughby Maynard, all of whom {{emphasized}} classical portraiture and figure drawing. Beginning in 1923, Johnson worked with the painter Charles Webster Hawthorne, who emphasized the importance of color in painting. John <b>studied</b> <b>with</b> Hawthorne at the Cape Cod School of Art in Provincetown, Massachusetts during the summers, paying for his tuition, food and lodging by working as a general handyman at the school. Johnson received a number of awards at the National Academy of Design, and applied for a coveted Pulitzer Travel Scholarship in his final year. When another student was given the award, Hawthorne raised nearly $1000 to enable Johnson to go abroad to study.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{researchers}} in the field focus on development of cognitive flexibility {{between the ages of}} three and five. However, cognitive flexibility {{has been shown to be}} a broad concept that can be <b>studied</b> <b>with</b> all different ages and situations. Thus, with tasks ranging from simple to more complex, research suggests that there is a developmental continuum that spans from infancy to adulthood.|$|E
5|$|In {{reducing}} conditions, mendelevium(III) can {{be easily}} reduced to mendelevium(II), which is stable in aqueous solution. The standard reduction potential of the E°(Md3+→Md2+) couple was variously estimated in 1967 as −0.10V or −0.20V: later 2013 experiments established the value as /Md2+ Reduction Potential <b>Studied</b> <b>with</b> Flow Electrolytic Chromatography |journal=Inorganic Chemistry |volume=52 |issue=21 |pages=12311–3 |doi=10.1021/ic401571h}} In comparison, E°(Md3+→Md0) should be around −1.74V, and E°(Md2+→Md0) should be around −2.5V.

5|$|Long-lived {{isotopes}} of nobelium and isotopes of lawrencium (and of heavier elements) {{have relatively}} short half-lives. For nobelium 11 isotopes are known with mass numbers 250–260 and 262. The chemical properties of nobelium and lawrencium were <b>studied</b> <b>with</b> 255No (t1/2 = 3 min) and 256Lr (t1/2 = 35 s).

5|$|S. g. crissalis, (vulnerable) the Lord Howe currawong was {{described}} by English naturalist Richard Bowdler Sharpe in 1877. It appears to have adapted well to human habitation on Lord Howe Island, though the population is small overall, somewhere around 70–80 birds. Although regarded as a subspecies, {{it has yet to}} be <b>studied</b> <b>with</b> molecular DNA techniques, which may lead to it being reclassified as a separate species.|$|E
5|$|She {{obtained}} a Fulbright Scholarship {{to study at}} Newnham College, {{one of the two}} women-only colleges of the University of Cambridge in England, where she continued actively writing poetry and publishing her work in the student newspaper Varsity.

5|$|Sixteen {{isotopes}} of americium {{are known}} with mass numbers from 232 to 248. The most important are 241Am and 243Am, which are alpha-emitters and also emit soft, but intense γ-rays; {{both of them}} can be obtained in an isotopically pure form. Chemical properties of americium were first <b>studied</b> <b>with</b> 241Am, but later shifted to 243Am, which is almost 20 times less radioactive. The disadvantage of 243Am is production of the short-lived daughter isotope 239Np, which has to be considered in the data analysis.|$|E
