50|$|Steam traps {{work best}} when sized {{specifically}} for the application they are used on. Generally, {{it is better to}} oversize, as they will still discharge condensate when present and close or obstruct for live steam. However an oversized <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> may wear quickly, waste energy (use steam), and if drastically oversized can cause process issues.|$|E

50|$|The {{simplest}} form of <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> is a disc {{or short}} solid pipe nipple {{with a small}} hole drilled through it installed at the lowest point of the equipment. Since steam condensate will collect at the lowest point and live steam is about 1200 times greater in volume than this hot liquid, condensate is effectively removed and steam is blocked. However, {{the vast majority of}} steam traps in current operation are of the mechanical or thermostatically operated design.|$|E

5000|$|Mechanical traps. They have a float {{that rises}} and falls in {{relation}} to condensate level and this usually has a mechanical linkage attached that opens and closes the valve. Mechanical traps operate in direct relationship to condensate levels present {{in the body of}} the <b>steam</b> <b>trap.</b> Mechanical steam traps have a typical service of life of 3-4 years. Inverted bucket and float traps are examples of mechanical traps. Float traps are classified into [...] "free ball float traps" [...] and [...] "lever ball float traps".|$|E
50|$|Downward {{displacement}} (or gravity-type): As steam {{enters the}} chamber, it fills the upper areas first {{as it is}} less dense than air. This process compresses the air to the bottom, forcing it out through a drain which often contains a temperature sensor. Only when air evacuation is complete does the discharge stop. Flow is usually controlled by a <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> or a solenoid valve, but bleed holes are sometimes used, often {{in conjunction with a}} solenoid valve. As the steam and air mix, it is also possible to force out the mixture from locations in the chamber other than the bottom.|$|E

50|$|The {{official}} {{report released}} by the utility company on December 27, 2007, cited a combination of factors, accepting responsibility for deficient repair work done by a contractor that ultimately led to the rupture. The report said that excess sealant, previously used to repair a leaking joint, migrated to two <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> valves used to drain excess condensed water, clogging them. Then, when heavy rains {{on the day of}} the event cooled the pipe causing excess condensate to collect in the steam pipe, the valves could not remove it. As a precaution, the utility replaced more than 1600 similar valves throughout the system, but did not find any other clogs.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the energy loss through the <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> in the steam system. In industry, steam traps {{frequently}} fail {{but they are not}} noticed except when they are leaking. If <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> fail in failed open, live steam can escape to surrounding. High amount of energy will loss from the steam system. It takes weeks or months before it being repaired or replaced. The first objective {{of this study is to}} measure the heat loss for normal thermodynamic <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> in respond to operating pressure for different condensate load. The second objective is to measure the heat loss for failed open thermodynamic <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> in respond to operating pressure for different condensate load. The last objective is to compare energy loss between normal and failed open <b>steam</b> <b>trap.</b> From the last objective, the actual energy loss if failed <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> is not repaired is determined. Thermodynamic <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> has been tested in the experiment and the operating pressure is below 1 bar. Condensate that discharges from <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> is collected to record the reading of its temperature and weight. These data is used to determine the energy loss through the <b>steam</b> <b>trap.</b> For normal <b>steam</b> <b>trap,</b> energy loss for high condensate load is higher than low condensate load. For failed open <b>steam</b> <b>trap,</b> energy loss for high condensate load is lower than low condensate load. Finally, after comparing the result, steam system that has low condensate load has higher energy loss compare to high condensate load...|$|E

40|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>trap</b> is {{the most}} {{important}} link in the condensate loop because it connects steam usage with condensate return. The function of <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> is to discharge condensate while not permitting the escape of live steam. For the efficient usage of steam inside the process equipment, the steam should be kept inside the device until the complete steam is transformed into condensate. For thi s to be happen the <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> functioning will be in perfect condition. The main objective of the study is to analyse the operating characte ristics of the presently installed <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> and their effects on the efficiency of heat transfer in their respective process applications. From the study it may clear that trap failure may be of two-live steam to discharge and steam leak. Trap failure may also result in the water logging of heat exchangers of textile processing units.

The power plant is a coal fired power plant with its normal operation temperature of 540 °C. This study consists of failure mode inventory collection of the <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> bypass tube failure, collection of background information about the process, component function and operating conditions. Detailed investigation carried out by visual examination, nondestructive testing (NDT), metallurgical testing which consists of microstructure examination, chemical testing and mechanical testing. Optical Microscopy (OM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) combined with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), Glow Discharge Spectrometer (GDS) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Diffraction (XRD) experiments were used throughout the investigation on the sample obtained.

40|$|In oil {{refineries}} and petrochemical plants {{large number of}} steam traps are used to discharge condensate from steam mains, tracers and process equipment. Early efforts on steam traps focused almost exclusively on their selection and sizing, {{and it was not}} until the 1973 oil embargo that a need for regular maintenance became recognized. Although relatively small pieces of equipment, traps are responsible for large quantities of steam losses, decreased equipment efficiency and high maintenance costs; e. g., a <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> leaking 100 psig steam through a 1 / 8 inch orifice costs at least $ 2 k/yr if steam is valued at $ 5 /k lb.
