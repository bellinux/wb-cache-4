5|$|Christianity {{led to the}} {{development}} of a few phenomena characteristic of Byzantium. Namely, the intimate connection between Church and <b>State,</b> <b>a</b> legacy of Roman cultus. Also, the creation of a Christian philosophy that guided Byzantine Greeks in their everyday lives. And finally, the dichotomy between the Christian ideals of the Bible and classical Greek paideia which could not be left out, however, since so much of Christian scholarship and philosophy depended on it. These shaped Byzantine Greek character and the perceptions of themselves and others.|$|E

5|$|Florida State {{began the}} fourth quarter in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a third down, needing three yards for a first down. Weinke completed a pass for {{just short of the}} needed three yards. Instead of punting the ball away, Florida State head coach Bobby Bowden ordered the team to attempt to convert the first down. He brought backup quarterback Marcus Outzen into the game as a misdirection move, and instead of running a quarterback sneak as anticipated, Outzen tossed the ball to Minor, who ran for 16yards and a first down. During the play, Virginia Tech committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty that advanced the ball further and gave Florida <b>State</b> <b>a</b> first down at the Virginia Tech 23-yard line. Weinke returned to the game and threw a 10-yard pass to Chaney for another first down. Weinke threw an incomplete pass, then Tech stopped a rush up the middle for no gain. On third down, Weinke connected on a touchdown pass to Dugans, returning the lead to Florida State. The Seminoles, as had Virginia Tech before them, elected to attempt a two-point conversion. Unlike Virginia Tech's failed two-point conversions, the Seminoles successfully earned two points with a pass to Warrick, and the scores gave Florida <b>State</b> <b>a</b> 3629 lead with 12:59 remaining.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, {{the tribe}} {{filed suit in}} the United States Court of Federal Claims, seeking $14,000,000 in damages for breach of trust by DOI. The tribe argued that the United States had {{exclusive}} control over the buildings and allowed them to fall into disrepair, {{a violation of the}} trust relationship established by the 1960 statute. Additionally, the tribe claimed that the Snyder Act and the National Historic Preservation Act applied in this case. The Snyder Act deals with appropriations to the BIA, and the National Historic Preservation Act discussed federal assistance for preservation programs. The United States moved for dismissal on the basis of lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to <b>state</b> <b>a</b> claim. In addition, the United States claimed that the statute of limitations had run under both the Tucker Act and the Indian Tucker Act, the acts governing claims in the Federal Court of Claims.

40|$|We {{consider}} the verification {{of a class}} of infinite-state systems called lossy channel systems, which consist of finite-state processes communicating via unbounded but lossy FIFO channels. This class is able to model several interesting protocols, such as HDLC, the Alternating Bit Protocol, and other Sliding Window protocols. In earlier papers we have considered the decidability of various temporal properties for lossy channel systems. In this paper we study simulation and bisimulation relations between lossy channel systems and finite transition systems. More precisely, we show the decidability of (1) whether <b>a</b> <b>state</b> in <b>a</b> finite transition system simulates <b>a</b> <b>state</b> in <b>a</b> lossy channel system, and conversely, (2) whether <b>a</b> <b>state</b> in <b>a</b> finite transition system is bisimilar to <b>a</b> <b>state</b> in <b>a</b> lossy channel system, and (3) whether <b>a</b> <b>state</b> in <b>a</b> finite [...] ...|$|R
