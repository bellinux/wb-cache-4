40|$|Introduction: One of {{the real}} effects of mining {{techniques}} is the defilement of water bodies through mine water waste, spillage of water presented to minerals, water from <b>soil</b> <b>stacks,</b> corrosive mine seepage and mine water rebound. Water is the most critical component of eco-framework and it is subsequently basic to focus and moderate the impacts of mining operation on the same. Additionally, contaminated water {{has a lot of}} physical, chemical and physiological consequences for all living creatures. For this, it is imperative to distinguish the critical parameters in the water test which is the extent of the study. Sampling: Samples are collected from different locations near iron-ore mines spread in Sundargarh district of Odisha. Both surface and ground water samples are collected to check whether mining activities is having some impacts on them or not. The samples are analysed through a series of experiments for assessing the physical and chemical parameters such as pH, Turbidity, TDS, DO, BOD, Nitrate, Sulphate, Chloride, Conductivity etc. After determining the parameters, the water quality index is being found out to assess the pollution efficiency of the water samples. Water quality index {{is one of the most}} used tool of water quality modelling. There are a lot of water quality index used now a days. Among them two most reliable are being used for the analysis of the samples. They are 1. National Sanitation Fund Water Quality Index (NSF-WQI) 2. Weighted Arithmetic Water Quality Index (WA-WQI) Conclusion: As per the observations, it is seen that te surface water is more contaminated compared to ground water...|$|R

Tests were performed on samples of a high plasticity clay from the Gulf of Mexico, a low plasticity organic silt from Rhode Island, and a low plasticity sensitive clay from Portland, Maine. All soils were tested using both confinement types, with the only difference being the use of stacked rings or the wire reinforced membrane. Measured values of undrained shear strength for both normally consolidated and overconsolidated samples were very similar using both confining systems. Samples confined with the wire reinforced membrane exhibited more strain softening beyond the peak strength and more vertical strain to the effective consolidation stress than samples confined with stacked rings. These results show that both confining systems can be used with confidence for determination of the undrained shear strength. ...|$|R
40|$|The first {{experimental}} {{demonstration of}} the Virtual Bandwidth SAR (VB-SAR) scheme is provided. VB-SAR is a new technique that promises subsurface imaging of soils at ultra-high, centimeter-scale resolution at large stand-off distances applicable to aircraft and spacecraft. This paper reports on how a stack of C-band images were used to retrieve high resolution vertical profiles of the backscattering through a soil in the laboratory. The VB-SAR scheme captures the phase behavior of a <b>soil</b> across a <b>stack</b> of DInSAR images as the soil dries. The real frequency of the interrogating radar behaves as a higher, virtual frequency within the soil {{by virtue of its}} higher-than-air dielectric. As the dielectric changes with time, the DInSAR stack captures a virtual bandwidth. Using this scheme, it was possible to produce a vertical slice of the backscatter through a soil at 10 cm resolution, much improved on the formal 1 m resolution offered by the real 150 MHz bandwidth...|$|R
40|$|The Kislyakovskiy 13 kurgan {{cemetery}} was excavated in 2008 by {{an expedition}} of the Southern Scientific Center, RAS. Kurgan 2 contained two graves – one dated {{to the first}} centuries AD, {{the other to the}} Middle Ages, when the North Black Sea steppes were inhabited by the nomadic Polovеts tribes. This article discusses grave 2. The burial was made in a chamber {{in the form of a}} niche. Robbers destroyed one of the grave’s walls but the burial remained undisturbed. The buried woman of 35 - 40 years old was laying extended on back, head to west. Decayed wood from the funerary stretchers preserved under the skeleton. The rich grave goods included a bronze cauldron, an iron knife, two silver torques, hair rings, and a mirror. Fragments of the wooden frame, felt, textile, and gilded silver foil from a headdress preserved in area of the woman’s chest. The kurgan was encircled by a ditch; its northern part had two ledged niches made in the outer wall. Animal bones and ceramic shards with remains of the funerary feast were unearthed on the ditch bottom. The ditch was thoroughly made and has unique construction features. Judging by its lower layers, the dug-out <b>soil</b> was <b>stacked</b> not only on the kurgan’s surface but also round the ditch’s outer perimeter. The ditch remained opened for a long time and was gradually filled with flooded soil. Grave goods are typical for the Cuman graves of the 12 th - early 13 th centuries. The assemblage suggests a high social status of the buried woman. It is possible that for some time the area surrounded by the ditch was used as a sanctuary; afterwards the burial of a noble woman was performed, the kurgan was covered with a layer of soil. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe seismic {{response}} of surficial multilayered soils to strong earthquakes is analyzed through a nonlinear one-directional three-component (1 D- 3 C) wave propagation model. The three components (3 C-polarization) {{of the incident}} wave are simultaneously propagated into a horizontal multilayered soil. A 3 D nonlinear constitutive relation for dry soils under cyclic loading is implemented in a quadratic line finite element model. The soil rheology is modeled by mean of a multi-surface cyclic plasticity model of the Masing-Prandtl-Ishlinskii-Iwan type. Its major advantage is that the rheology is characterized by few nonlinear parameters commonly available. Previous studies showed that, when comparing one to three component unidirectional wave propagation simulations, the soil shear modulus decreases and the dissipation increases, for a given maximum strain amplitude. The 3 D loading path due to the 3 C-polarization leads to multiaxial stress interaction that reduces soil strength and increases nonlinear effects. Nonlinearity and coupling effects between components are more obvious with decreasing seismic velocity ratio in the soil and increasing vertical to horizontal component ratio for the incident wave. This research aims at comparing computed ground motions at the surface of soil profiles in the Tohoku area (Japan) with 3 C seismic signals recorded during the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. The 3 C recorded downhole motion is imposed as boundary condition {{at the base of}} <b>soil</b> layer <b>stack.</b> Notable amplification phenomena are shown, comparing seismograms at the bottom and at the surface. The 1 D- 3 C approach evidences the influence of the 3 D loading path and input wavefield polarization. 3 C motion and 3 D stress and strain evolution are evaluated all over the soil profile. The triaxial mechanical coupling is pointed out by observing the variation of the propagating wave polarization all along the duration of seismograms. The variation of the maximum horizontal component of motion with time, as well as the influence of the vertical component, confirm the interest of taking into account the 3 C nonlinear coupling in 1 D wave propagation models for such a large event...|$|R

Identification was carried out {{on the basis of}} polyphasic taxonomy. Phylogenetic analysis of 16 S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain 13 -Q(T) belonged to the genus Pedobacter, and the highest similarity was 94. 4 % with Pedobacter terricola KCTC 12876 (T). Strain 13 -Q(T) was able to grow at 10 - 40 A degrees C, in pH 5. 0 - 10. 0, in the presence of 0 - 2. 0 % NaCl. The major fatty acids were iso-C- 15 : 0 (40. 4 %), summed feature 3 (comprising iso-C- 15 : 0 2 -OH and/or C- 16 : 1 omega 7 c) (18. 9 %) and iso-C- 17 : 0 3 -OH (18. 4 %). The predominant menaquinone was MK- 7. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 42. 7 mol%. Strain 13 -Q(T) could be distinguished from the nearest phylogenetic neighbors by various chemotaxonomic and phenotypic properties. The results of the polyphasic analyses suggested that strain 13 -Q(T) should be considered to represent a novel species of the genus Pedobacter, for which the name Pedobacter hainanensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 13 -Q(T) (=CCTCC AB 2012076 (T) = NRRL B- 59850 (T)) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractInvasion by alien {{woody species}} {{is a major}} threat to {{biodiversity}} and ecosystem function in the Fynbos and Grassland Biomes of South Africa, and riparian areas are particularly affected. Large stands of the Australian Acacia longifolia have been cleared in catchments in the grassy fynbos of the Eastern Cape. After clearing mature stands of A. longifolia, the dead material is usually stacked, left to dry and eventually burned. There is concern that this results in very high fire intensities to the detriment of native seed banks, and {{it has been suggested that}} smaller slash stacks or burning when soils are damp could reduce this impact. We examined the effects of soil moisture (moist vs. dry), depth of burial (2 vs. 4  cm below soil surface) and fuel load (small vs. large slash stacks of the kind typically constructed during clearing operations) on soil temperatures and seed viability of A. longifolia and four common native plant species, viz. Hermannia hyssopifolia, Psoralea pinnata, Senecio chrysocoma and Virgilia divaricata. In the field, an experimental burn of two slash piles was performed to determine the soil temperature during fire. Soil temperatures were found to be higher in dry soils, at shallower depth and under higher fuel loads, with the effect of moisture being the most pronounced. Temperatures in dry <b>soils</b> under large <b>stacks</b> exceeded 330  °C at 2  cm depth. A laboratory experiment showed that A. longifolia and P. pinnata had higher germination in moist soils and at lower soil temperatures while V. divaricata showed the opposite response. S. chrysocoma had low germination in all treatments and H. hyssopifolia did not show a consistent response to the treatments. Heat treatment increased germination in all species, and seeds of all species could withstand maximum temperatures of up to 160  °C and sustained temperatures exceeding 100  °C for more than 20  min. The results show that seed banks of these species can survive fires under slash stacks but stacking slash in smaller piles, or burning when soils are moist, reduces the risk of losing seeds in the upper soil layers to extreme soil temperatures...|$|R
