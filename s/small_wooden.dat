5|$|According to the Dalai Lama, {{among the}} many images in the temple was an image of Chenrizi, made of clay in the temple, within which the <b>small</b> <b>wooden</b> statue of the Buddha brought from Nepal was hidden. The image was in the temple for 1300 years, and when Songtsen Gampo died his soul was {{believed}} to have entered the <b>small</b> <b>wooden</b> statue. During the Cultural Revolution, the clay image was smashed and the smaller Buddha was given by a Tibetan to the Dalai Lama.|$|E
5|$|Hugo LaFayette Black was the {{youngest}} of the eight children of William Lafayette Black and Martha Toland Black. He was born on February 27, 1886, in a <b>small</b> <b>wooden</b> farmhouse in Ashland, Alabama, a poor, isolated rural Clay County town in the Appalachian foothills.|$|E
5|$|A <b>small</b> <b>wooden</b> {{platform}} {{was built}} at Hellingly railway station, opposite {{the main line}} platform. This had no connection to the station buildings and was used only for the transfer of passengers between main-line and hospital trains, and kept chained off when not in use. Coal yards and sidings were also built at Hellingly station. The hospital opened to patients, and the railway to passengers, on 20 July 1903.|$|E
50|$|The shrine also {{included}} a number of <b>smaller</b> <b>wooden</b> columns, with burnt offerings (mostly jewels, agricultural products, and animals) buried next to them.|$|R
50|$|A large {{variety of}} <b>smaller</b> <b>wooden</b> objects were carved by the Kwakwaka'wakw. These {{included}} whistles, rattles, kerfed boxes, effigies, staffs, utensils, ceremonial knives, headdresses, headbands and food vessels.|$|R
5000|$|P-series {{guitars and}} basses {{featured}} a <b>smaller</b> <b>wooden</b> body with bolt-on composite neck. The body was shaped {{more like an}} arrow or mini-A than the rectangular L series body.|$|R
5|$|All British {{patterns}} were different, first tested on <b>small</b> <b>wooden</b> models viewed through a periscope in a studio. Most {{of the model}} designs were painted by women from London's Royal Academy of Arts. A foreman then scaled up their designs for the real thing. Painters, however, were not alone in the project. Creative people including sculptors, artists, and set designers designed camouflage.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the church consists of a large, open floor plan, with wooden pews lined perpendicular {{to the north and}} south sides, thus creating a central aisle. The altar is a <b>small</b> <b>wooden</b> pulpit, which serves as a lectern that is accessible by a <b>small</b> <b>wooden</b> step; the altar is accented by a large wooden backdrop of casing with dentil molding. Each of the church's interior walls is covered with pine wainscot panelling and wallpaper, and topped with wooden crown molding. Wooden swag moldings accentuate the four symmetrically-placed six-over-six double-hung sash wooden windows, the doorway's wooden casing, and the transom window. The wooden pews are simple, with cushions added for comfortable seating. The original ceiling is obscured by a dropped ceiling, which also conceals the electrical conduits for the church's brass chandeliers. Prior to the church's electrification, kerosene lanterns were used for light, and the lanterns remain in the church for decorative purposes. The church's floor consists of the original heart pine planks. Concrete blocks and cut stone border the building's perimeter to prevent animals from entering the church's crawl space. Within the crawl space, log carrier beams support the building, on which the bark remains extant.|$|E
5|$|The {{line through}} Lynn was built at surface level. A number of {{stations}} have served Lynn, including a series of stations near the current location at Central Square {{as well as a}} number of other stations around the city. The first depot at the Central Square location, built in 1838, was a <b>small</b> <b>wooden</b> building.|$|E
5000|$|... n. Any {{of several}} <b>smaller,</b> <b>wooden</b> table top games {{developed}} from the original bagatelle in which the pockets are made of pins; also called pin bagatelle, hit-a-pin bagatelle, jaw ball.|$|R
50|$|Phu Tam Pra Waterfall is {{a scenic}} though mainly {{seasonal}} waterfall. Above this waterfall is a cave grotto housing a three-foot wide Buddha image along {{with hundreds of}} <b>smaller</b> <b>wooden</b> Buddha images and animal models.|$|R
50|$|The {{military}} {{experiences of}} the crusades also had their effects in Europe; for example, European castles became massive stone structures {{as they were in}} the east, rather than <b>smaller</b> <b>wooden</b> buildings as they had typically been in the past.|$|R
5|$|The {{western front}} facade {{is flanked by}} two square towers. They are both three stories high topped with silver domes and a Christian cross on top of these. Both towers have windows at each level. Access to the towers is through either of two <b>small</b> <b>wooden</b> doors located in the {{interior}} northwest and southwest corners of the church vestibule.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{stations}} were {{built for the}} line, including a major upgrade to Myrdal and port facilities at Flåm. Myrdal Station was given side tracks and additional buildings to serve transferring passengers, with the upgrades costing NOK0.5 million. Breikvam {{was the only place}} on-route which received a passing loop. Flåm Station cost NOK0.8 million and was designed in the 1930s NSB simple wooden functionalist style, similar to what is found on the Nordland Line and the Sørland Line. Other stations received <b>small,</b> <b>wooden</b> buildings with a waiting room, as well as a room for cargo at Vatnahalsen, Håreina and Dalsbotn.|$|E
5|$|The Palace of Westminster, {{the medieval}} royal palace {{used as the}} home of the British parliament, was largely {{destroyed}} by fire on 16 October 1834. The blaze was caused by the burning of <b>small</b> <b>wooden</b> tally sticks which had been used as part of the accounting procedures of the Exchequer until 1826. The sticks were disposed of in a careless manner in the two furnaces under the House of Lords, which caused a chimney fire in the two flues that ran under the floor of the Lords' chamber and up through the walls.|$|E
50|$|The edifice {{initially}} had two wall steeples(on {{the nave}} and narthex). Two <b>smaller</b> <b>wooden</b> steeples war latter added, above {{the porch and}} the altar. In 1900, the church roof burned in a fire and the wooden steeples were not rebuilt anymore.|$|R
25|$|It sits {{on top of}} an {{artesian}} well; {{built in}} 1911. However, no record of its construction can be found. Although it may have once been a <b>smaller</b> <b>wooden</b> tower, to qualify for historic designation in California, factual documentation must be presented.|$|R
50|$|Beaumont Hall has two functions. The {{upper floors}} of Beaumont Dormitory {{are the main}} {{residential}} rooms for 9th-grade boys. The ground floor houses the school's main dining room. It was built in 1909, when the current dining room replaced a <b>smaller,</b> <b>wooden</b> structure.|$|R
5|$|On {{completion}} of the course, participants are awarded the Wood Badge beads to recognize significant achievement in leadership and direct service to young people. The pair of <b>small</b> <b>wooden</b> beads, one on each end of a leather thong (string), is worn around the neck {{as part of the}} Scout uniform. The beads are presented together with a taupe neckerchief bearing a tartan patch of the Maclaren clan, honoring William de Bois Maclaren, who donated the £7000 to purchase Gilwell Park in 1919 plus an additional £3000 for improvements to the house that was on the estate. The neckerchief with the braided leather woggle (neckerchief slide) denotes the membership of the 1st Gilwell Scout Group or Gilwell Troop 1. Recipients of the Wood Badge are known as Wood Badgers or Gilwellians.|$|E
5|$|The Buenavista Social Club was a members-only club {{originally}} {{located in}} Buenavista (literally good view), a quarter {{in the current}} neighbourhood of Playa (before 1976 part of Marianao), one of the 15 municipalities in Cuba's capital, Havana. The original club was founded in 1932 in a <b>small</b> <b>wooden</b> venue at calle Consulado y paisaje “A” (currently calle 29, n. 6007). In 1939, {{due to lack of}} space the club relocated to number 4610 on Avenue 31, between calles 46 and 48, in Almendares, Marianao. This location is recalled by Juan Cruz, former director of the Marianao Social Club and master of ceremonies at the Salón Rosado de la Tropical (other nightclubs in Havana). As seen in the Buena Vista Social Club documentary, when musicians Ry Cooder, Compay Segundo and a film crew attempted to identify the location of the club in the 1990s, local people could not agree on where it had stood.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} for military action during Nyuserre's reign. William C. Hayes proposed that a few fragmentary limestone statues of kneeling and bound prisoners of war discovered in his mortuary temple possibly attest to punitive raids in Libya to the west or the Sinai and Palestine to the east during his reign. The art historian William Stevenson Smith has pointed out, that such statues were customary elements of the decoration of royal temples and mastabas, suggesting {{that they may not}} be immediately related to actual military campaigns. Similar statues and <b>small</b> <b>wooden</b> figures of kneeling captives were discovered in the mortuary complexes of Neferefre, Djedkare Isesi, Unas, Teti, Pepi I and Pepi II {{as well as in the}} tomb of vizier Senedjemib Mehi.|$|E

50|$|Calshot Velodrome is {{the oldest}} indoor cycling venue in the UK. It is located inside an old {{aircraft}} hangar, is unheated and {{has a reputation for}} being rather cold. The current wooden velodrome was built in 1996 to replace an older slightly <b>smaller</b> <b>wooden</b> track.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} located on an {{embankment}} {{beside the road}} leading to St Mary's Well Bay. It had two platforms linked by a metal footbridge, with a substantial stone building on the 'down' side, and a <b>smaller</b> <b>wooden</b> shelter on the other. The signal box opened in 1893.|$|R
5|$|Willie Irvine {{was born}} on 18 June 1943 {{in the village of}} Eden, County Antrim, on the east coast of Northern Ireland. He was born to Alex and Agnes Irvine, and had 17 half-brothers and half-sisters from his mother's {{previous}} marriages. Irvine was 11 months old when his father, who had played football for Distillery, died after being involved in a motorcycle accident. He came from a poor background and when he was young the family resided in a <b>small</b> <b>wooden</b> bungalow that had neither electricity nor running water. His mother worked often, and Irvine was looked after by his elder siblings. At the age of one, he started to attend Eden School so that he could be looked after by the teachers while his sisters earned money. When he was seven years old, the family moved to the Sunnylands estate in nearby Carrickfergus after his mother was sent to Omagh Prison for falsely claiming benefits.|$|E
5|$|Organic finds {{are rarely}} well {{documented}} with hoards, because most coin and treasure finds are removed hastily by the finder or have previously been disrupted by farm work rather than excavated. The Hoxne organic finds included bone, wood and other plant material, and leather. Small fragments from a decorated ivory pyxis (a cylindrical lidded box) were found, {{along with more}} than 150 tiny shaped pieces of bone inlay or veneer, probably from a wooden box or boxes that have decayed. Minuscule fragments of wood adhering to metal objects were identified as belonging to nine species of timber, all native to Britain: wood traces associated with the iron fittings of the outer chest established that {{it was made of}} oak. Silver locks and hinges were from two <b>small</b> <b>wooden</b> boxes or caskets, one made of decorative cherry wood and one made of yew. Some wheat straw survived from padding between the plain silver bowls, which also bore faint traces of linen cloth. Leather fragments were too degraded for identification.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} lightly damaged by saboteurs in December which {{disrupted}} progress and the Regia Marina decided to suspend construction in April 1942 as she remained {{nearly two years}} from completion. By late 1942, the Regia Marinas shortage of destroyers had reached a point that every possible hull was needed and construction restarted at a high priority. This allowed her to be launched on 18 July 1943, but shortly afterwards {{a change in the}} Italian leadership caused any further work to be suspended in August and the resources used in her construction to be diverted to finish a large group of <b>small</b> <b>wooden</b> minesweepers. During the fighting between the Germans and the Italians after the Italian surrender on 9 September, Spalato was scuttled in Split harbor on 24 September. The Germans occupied Split three days later, refloated the ship several weeks later and stripped her of any valuable material. As part of their scorched-earth strategy as they abandoned Split, the Germans scuttled Spalato and wrecked the shipyard before the Yugoslav Partisans occupied the port on 27 October 1944.|$|E

50|$|A {{memorial}} at Barnweill Church to Col J W Neil Smith of Barnweill and Swindridgemuir also {{bears the}} details of his wife Evelyn Mary Mapis Duke who died on June 21, 1940. 'Tout comprendre c'est tout pardonner' is carved on this stone and on a <b>smaller</b> <b>wooden</b> cross that bears her details alone.|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} {{controlled}} from the Control Tower. Targets included old ships. There were two <b>smaller</b> <b>wooden</b> observation towers {{to the east}} nearer the shore but these were demolished in 2009. Access was via a narrow road called Sea Lane via the junction with the A52 at the Barley Mow at Friskney Eaudyke.|$|R
5|$|The {{identification}} of the ship led to significant public interest in the salvage operation, and caused a great demand for the objects which were brought up. Though many of the objects could not be properly conserved {{at the time and}} subsequently deteriorated, many were documented with pencil sketches and watercolour drawings which survive to this day. John Deane ceased working on the wreck in 1836, but returned in 1840 with new, more destructive methods. With the help of condemned bomb shells filled with gunpowder acquired from the Ordnance Board he blasted his way into parts of the wreck. Fragments of bombs and traces of blasting craters were found during the modern excavations, but {{there was no evidence that}} Deane managed to penetrate the hard layer that had sealed off the Tudor levels. Deane reported retrieving a bilge pump and the lower part of the main mast, both of which would have been located inside the ship. The recovery of <b>small</b> <b>wooden</b> objects like longbows suggests that Deane did manage to penetrate the Tudor levels at some point, though this has been disputed by the excavation project leader Margaret Rule. Newspaper reports on Deane's diving operations in October 1840 report that the ship was clinker built, but since the sterncastle is the only part of the ship with this feature, an alternative explanation has been suggested: Deane did not penetrate the hard shelly layer that covered most of the ship, but only managed to get into remains of the sterncastle that today no longer exist. Despite the rough handling by Deane the Mary Rose escaped the wholesale destruction by giant rakes and explosives that was the fate of other wrecks in the Solent.|$|E
