40|$|Aim: It {{has been}} {{hypothesised}} that in atopic dermatitis, the dysfunctional skin barrier facilitates the transcutaneous presentation of allergens to the immune system. This study examined whether atopic dermatitis increased {{the likelihood of}} polysensitisation, namely sensitisation to five or more allergens. Methods: We examined the electronic hospital charts of 1743 children aged 0 - 17 years who had visited primary or secondary care physicians with allergic symptoms, whose blood was examined {{for the presence of}} specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) to the 10 most common inhaled and food allergens and whose files contained documentation of the presence of atopic dermatitis and other <b>skin</b> disorders. <b>Sensitisation</b> was defined as a specific IgE level of >= 0. 35 kU/L. Results: Polysensitisation was more common in children with atopic dermatitis (268 / 1197, 22. 4 %) than those without (30 / 546, 5. 5 %, p < 0. 001). This remained significant after adjustment for gender and age in a multiple logistic regression model (odds ratio: 5. 63, 95 % confidence interval 3. 77 - 8. 40). Other skin disorders did not show an increased risk of polysensitisation (5 / 97, 5. 2 %). Conclusion: Polysensitisation was considerably more common in children with atopic dermatitis than those without. This supports the hypothesis that sensitisation occurs through a defective skin barrier and appears to be specific for atopic dermatitis...|$|R

Aims and objectives: The {{research}} {{aims and}} objectives of this thesis were: (i) to review literature pertaining to different dermal exposure assessment methods; (ii) to assess dermal exposure of refinery workers to nickel and/or cobalt by making use of skin wipes as a removal method; (iii) to assess concurrently the skin condition of the above mentioned workers by measuring skin hydration, transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and skin surface pH, and (iv) to compare South African <b>skin</b> notations and <b>sensitisation</b> notations with those of other developed countries. Methods: Refinery workers from two base metal refineries participated in this study. Skin condition and dermal exposure was measured on different anatomical areas before, during {{and at the end of}} a work shift. Dermal exposure to nickel and/or cobalt was assessed with Ghostwipes TM as a removal method. Wipe samples of potentially contaminated surfaces in the workplace were also collected. Wipes were analysed for nickel and/or cobalt according to NIOSH method 9102, using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometry. The assignment and use of <b>skin</b> notations and <b>sensitisation</b> notations in South African legislation and six other developed countries were compared. Results: To date, occupational dermal exposure has been reported for numerous substances by making use of surrogate skin methods (interception methods), removal methods and fluorescent tracer methods (in situ detection methods). From published literature it is evident that skin (dermal) wipes, as a removal method, are the most appropriate method to assess dermal exposure to metals. Varying degrees of skin dryness (low hydration indices) and impaired barrier function (high TEWL indices) are reported, with the hands being implicated the most. However, normal skin condition is also reported for some anatomical areas. Skin surface pH for all anatomical areas sampled decreased significantly during the shift, but remained in normal range. Dermal exposure to nickel occurred during the shift at the electro-winning plant of one refinery, while dermal co-exposure to cobalt and nickel occurred at the cobalt plant of the other refinery. At both of the refineries, cobalt and/or nickel was collected from the workersâ€™ skin even before the shift. Also, dermal exposure to these metals was highly variable between individual workers. Skin notations in South African legislation had a mean agreement of between 42. 9 % and 45. 8 % with other countries, while agreement for sensitisation notations was only 3. 6 % between countries.

Dinitrochlorobenzene <b>skin</b> contact <b>sensitisation</b> (DNCB), phytohaemagglutinin <b>skin</b> (PHA) and homologous passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (HPCA) tests have been used for diagnosis of immunosuppression in man. The purposes of these experiments were to detect immunosuppression caused by T. evansi infection and malnutrition in normal and malnutrition buffaloes. Sixteen male and female buffaloes, 12 - 18 months of ages were divided into 4 groups, Group 1 fed with high grade of ration and infected with T. evansi, Group 2 fed with high grade of ration not infected, Group 3 fed with low grade of ration and infected with T. evansi, and Group 4 fed with low grade of ration and not infected. Buffaloes fed with high grade of ration are assumed as normal animals, while buffaloes fed with low grade of ration are assumed as malnutrion animals. These buffaloes were kept in fly proof fences in the Research Institute for Veterinary Science, Bogor. The experimental results indicated that normal buffaloes produced significantly (P< 0, 05) wider and thicker inflammation areas in DNCB and PHA test respectively than malnutrition and T.

HpD and Photofrin II induced modest tumour photosensitisation at the cost of substantial <b>skin</b> and brain <b>sensitisation.</b> At doses low enough to keep sensitisation of these normal tissues within acceptable limits, tumour sensitisation was sufficient to give necrosis only approximately 2 mm deep after exposure to 10 J cm- 2 light. In contrast, doses of p-THPP, K-p-THPP and m-THPP that produced skin and brain sensitivity within acceptable limits sensitised tumours enough to give 4 - 9 mm necrosis after 10 J cm- 2 light. m-THPP was, on a molar basis, about 25 - 30 times as potent as HpD and Photofrin II in sensitising tumours. o-THPP was also a potent tumour photosensitiser, but induced a prohibitive degree of skin photosensitivity even at low doses. It is unlikely that these differences in relative selectivity are due to differences in such photophysical parameters as optimum activating wavelength (which would affect tissue penetration by light), or light absorption, and physicochemical factors that determine tissue localisation may be involved.

40|$|Atopic {{dermatitis}} (AD) is a pruritic, chronically relapsing inflammatory skin disease; its aetiology {{is presumed}} to be multifactorial with interactions between genetic and environmental factors. In recent decades the prevalence of AD has increased remarkably, most likely due to environmental factors in early life. While AD usually presents in the first year, few prospective cohort {{studies have focused on}} young children with AD. The present overall objective was to study, prospectively, different aspects of AD in very young children from a community birth cohort of 4089. Two hundred and twenty-one children with AD from the cohort were followed consecutively and clinically from onset of AD. At 2 years they were examined concerning Hanifin's and Rajka's criteria for AD, eczema severity and atopic <b>sensitisation</b> (<b>skin</b> prick test to foods, Phadiatop). Mild-to-moderate eczema predominated, and the majority (67 %) were not sensitised. Eczema severity did not differ between sensitised and non-sensitised children. Xerosis, course influenced by environmental factors, and facial erythema, were the only signs meeting the minor criteria in more than 50 % of patients, and these therefore seem the most useful in diagnosing AD at two years of age. Using annual questionnaires, we studied the cumulative incidence of AD, other atopic disease manifestations and infections in the cohort. Atopic diseases in parents and siblings and exposure to certain environmental factors were also recorded. The occurrence of serum IgE antibodies to inhalant and food allergens was analysed at 4 years of age, and AD was divided into IgE-associated AD and nonIgE-associated. Already during the first two years, there was a significant association not only between AD and other atopic disease manifestations; but also between AD and respiratory infections manifested in an increased rate of acute otitis media, pneumonia and use of antibiotics. There was a higher proportion of atopic disease manifestations, but not respiratory infections, in children with onset of AD {{during the first year of}} life than during the second. Cumulatively up to 4 years of age, 33 % reportedly had AD: 27. 1 % of the children without parental atopic history, 37. 9 % of those with single parental atopic history and 50. 0 % with double parental atopic history. The effects of parental history of eczema and of atopic respiratory disease did not differ significantly, nor did those of matemal history and of paternal. Parental eczema was a risk factor for AD irrespective of its association with IgE, but parental history of atopic respiratory disease mainly increased the risk of IgE- associated. AD. The effect of three recommendations (to breast-feed exclusively for at least 4 months, and to avoid parental smoking and furred pets at home) from the Swedish national guidelines for the prevention of "allergy and atopic disease" on the development of AD up to 4 years was investigated. Even in families with double atopic heredity, 42 % missed out on at least one of these three recommendations. Following the Swedish national guidelines concerning breast-feeding, smoking and furred pets at home had little effect on the cumulative incidence of AD, nor on IgE-associated AD or non-IgE-associated AD, up to 4 years of age. Since the risk factors for AD and other atopic diseases seem to differ, future studies focusing on AD are required for the development of measures for its primary prevention...|$|R
40|$|This review {{describes}} {{the state of}} the art of available (Q) SARs/expert systems for <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisation</b> and evaluates their utility for potential regulatory use. There is a strong mechanistic understanding with respect to <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisation</b> which has facilitated the development of different models. Most existing models fall into one of two main categories either they are local in nature, usually specific to a chemical class or reaction chemical mechanism or else they are global in form, derived empirically using statistical methods. Some of the published global QSARs available have been recently characterised and evaluated elsewhere in accordance with the OECD principles. An overview of expert systems capable of predicting <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisation</b> is also provided. Recently, a new perspective regarding the development of mechanistic <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisation</b> QSARs so-called Quantitative Mechanistic Modelling (QMM) has been proposed, where reactivity and hydrophobicity, are used as the key parameters in mathematically modelling <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisation.</b> Whilst hydrophobicity can be conveniently modelled using log P, the octanol-water partition coefficient; reactivity is less readily determined from chemical structure. Initiatives are in progress to generate reactivity data for reactions relevant to <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisation</b> but more resources are required to realise a comprehensive set of reactivity data.

40|$|Identification of the <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisation</b> hazard of {{chemicals}} has traditionally {{relied on the}} use of animals. Progress in the development of alternative methods has been prompted by the increasing knowledge of the key biological mechanisms underlying this human health effect, as documented by the OECD's recent report summarising the key biological events leading to <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisation</b> ("Adverse Outcome Pathway" (AOP) for <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisation).</b> The molecular initiating event defined within this AOP is the covalent binding {{of chemicals}} with skin proteins. Thus peptide reactivity assays may provide valuable information in the context of integrated approaches such as Weight of Evidence (WoE) or Integrated Testing Strategies (ITS) for <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisation</b> hazard and safety assessment. Based on these considerations, EURL ECVAM coordinated a validation study on the Direct Peptide Reactivity Assay (DPRA) addressing mainly the test methodâ€™s transferability and within- and between-laboratory reproducibility. Following independent scientific peer review by the EURL ECVAMâ€™s Scientific Advisory Committee (ESAC) and having considered the input from regulators, stakeholders, international partners and the general public, EURL ECVAM concluded that the DPRA may prove a valuable component of a WoE or ITS for <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisation</b> hazard assessment. In addition to this, the DPRA may also be able to contribute to the assessment of sensitising potency, e. g. by supporting sub-categorisation of sensitisers according to UN GHS.

40|$|The <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisation</b> {{potential}} of chemicals is currently assessed using in vivo methods where the murine local lymph node assay (LLNA) is typically {{the method of}} first choice. Current regulatory initiatives are driving {{the impetus for the}} use of in vitro/in silico alternative approaches to provide the relevant information needed for the effective assessment of <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisation,</b> for both hazard characterisation and risk assessment purposes. A chemical must undergo a number of steps for it to induce <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisation</b> but the main determining step is formation of a stable covalent association with carrier protein. The ability of a chemical to react covalently with carrier protein nucleophiles relates to both its electrophilic reactivity and its hydrophobicity. This paper focuses on quantitative indices of electrophilic reactivity with nucleophiles, in a chemical mechanism-ofaction context, and compares and contrasts the experimental approaches available to generate reactivity data that are suitable for mathematical modelling and making predictions of <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisation</b> potential, using new chemistry data correlated against existing in vivo bioassay data. As such, the paper goes on to describe an illustrative example of how quantitative kinetic measures of reactivity can be usefully and simply applied to perform mechanism-based read-across that enables hazard characterisation of <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisation</b> potential. An illustration of the types of quantitative mechanistic models that could be built using databases of kinetic measures of reactivity, hydrophobicity and existing in vivo bioassay data is also given.

40|$|<b>Skin</b> <b>sensitisation</b> {{potential}} is an endpoint {{that needs to}} be assessed within the framework of existing and forthcoming legislation. At present, <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisation</b> hazard is normally identified using in vivo test methods, the favoured approach being the local lymph node assay (LLNA). This method can also provide a measure of relative skin sensitising potency which is essential for assessing and managing human health risks. One potential alternative approach to <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisation</b> hazard identification is the use of (Quantitative) structure activity relationships ((Q) SARs) coupled with appropriate documentation and performance characteristics. This represents a major challenge.

In May 2010, a COLIPA scientific meeting was held to analyse to what extent <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisation</b> safety assessments for cosmetic ingredients can be made in the absence of animal data. In order to propose guiding principles for the application and further development of non-animal safety assessment strategies it was evaluated how and when non-animal test methods, predictions based on physico-chemical properties (including in silico tools), threshold concepts and weight-of-evidence based hazard characterisation could be used to enable safety decisions. Generation and assessment of potency information from alternative tools which at present is predominantly derived from the LLNA is considered the future key research area...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} non-animal data to assess <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisation</b> {{properties}} of substances, especially cosmetics ingredients, has spawned {{the development of}} many in vitro methods. As {{it is widely believed}} that no single method can provide a solution, the Cosmetics Europe Skin Tolerance Task Force has defined a three-phase framework {{for the development of a}} non-animal testing strategy for <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisation</b> potency prediction. The results of the first phase - systematic evaluation of 16 test methods - are presented here. This evaluation involved generation of data on a common set of ten substances in all methods and systematic collation of information including the level of standardisation, existing test data, potential for throughput, transferability and accessibility in cooperation with the test method developers. A workshop was held with the test method developers to review the outcome of this evaluation and to discuss the results. The evaluation informed the prioritisation of test methods for the next phase of the non-animal testing strategy development framework. Ultimately, the testing strategy - combined with bioavailability and skin metabolism data and exposure consideration - is envisaged to allow establishment of a data integration approach for <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisation</b> safety assessment of cosmetic ingredients...|$|E

40|$|Chemicals {{applied in}} products, {{such as food}} products, {{pharmaceuticals}} or cosmetics, create great benefits in society while posing risks to {{human health and the}} quality of the environment. To control those risks, it is mandatory to perform risk assessments of chemicals which require information on their hazardous properties. To meet these information requirements without sacrificing large numbers of animal tests, many non-animal testing methods and strategies have become available. Given the increasing needs for assessing chemicalsâ€™ risks, toxicity testing has become costly in terms of testing costs, time and animal welfare. Focusing on <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisation</b> as a case study, this thesis aims at introducing an economic approach towards the optimisation of toxicity testing strategies. Chapter 2 surveys the current status of non-animal toxicity testing strategies assessing <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisation</b> and compares criteria suggested in the toxicological literature with the conceptual and informational criteria introduced in this chapter for increasing resource-efficiency in the development of testing strategies. Chapter 3 extends to the development of a Bayesian Value-of-Information model for the optimisation of non-animal toxicity testing strategies. This optimisation model is applied to construct optimal non-animal toxicity testing strategies for the assessment of <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisation</b> potential. Chapter 4 focuses on the precision of testing methods and the impact of limited precision on the evaluation of test results. The borderline range of testing methods is quantified and applied as an additional evaluation measure in the prediction models of testing methods to identify substances as positive and negative (for substances yielding clear-cut test results), or as discordant (for substances yielding test results within the borderline range). Chapter 5 addresses the uncertainties underlying the predictive accuracy metrics for non-animal testing methods due to their limited precision, the sample size and composition of the samples of chemicals used to estimate the predictive capacity of testing methods. Chapters 4 and 5 focus on non-animal testing methods for the assessment of <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisation</b> potential. This thesis concludes that introducing the economic perspective into the construction of toxicity testing strategies is necessary to develop the means by which resource-efficiency in toxicity testing is achieved. Furthermore, the evaluation of testing methods should consider both predictivity and precision limitations such that decision makers can draw robust conclusions on the hazardous properties of chemicals...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} models to predict mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, developmental toxicity, and <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisation</b> {{for a set}} of 27 conazoles. The predictions were performed with the program package CAESAR, which is available on the Internet. The CAESAR programs were developed to support the European Community Regulation on chemicals and their safe use (REACH) and follow the OECD principles for (Q) SAR models used for regulatory purposes. The programs provide a number of information, including a binary classifi cation of a compound as toxic or non-toxic and information on similar compounds from the modelâ€™s training sets (similarity sets). In this study we analysed conazole sets using principal component analysis (PCA). The predictions were compared to the currently valid classifi cation of these substances in the European Union (EU) or to the classifi cation proposed at expert meetings of the Pesticide Risk Assessment and Peer Review (PRAPeR) group. The predicted classifi cation for mutagenicity was in good agreement with regulatory classifi cation, the predictions for carcinogenicity and developmental toxicity showed some discrepancy in particular cases, while the predictions for <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisation</b> showed even greater discrepancy...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey was}} carried out on {{respiratory}} symptoms and skin prick test response to common allergens (atopy), storage mites, and occupational allergens among 226 bakers and pastry makers from 105 small businesses in northern Italy. Atopy was present in 54 workers (23. 4 %); 40 workers (17. 7 %) were skin positive {{to at least one}} storage mite, 27 (11. 9 %) to wheat flour and 17 (7. 5 %) to alpha-amylase. Work related asthma was reported by 11 (4. 9 %) workers and rhinoconjunctivitis by 31 (17. 7 %); 22 workers (10. 2 %) complained of chronic bronchitis. The distribution of skin prick test results among bakers and among 119 white collar workers did not indicate (by logistic analysis) an increased risk for bakers to <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisation</b> to common allergens, storage mite, or to a group of five flours. Sensitisation to wheat flour, on the other hand, was present only among exposed workers. <b>Skin</b> <b>sensitisation</b> to occupational allergens was significantly associated with atopy (p < 0. 001), smoking habit (p = 0. 015), and work seniority (p = 0. 027). The risk of work related symptoms was associated with sensitisation to wheat or alpha-amylase, and with atopy, but not with sensitisation to storage mites, work seniority, or smoking habit. The results of the study indicate that there is still a significant risk of allergic respiratory disease among Italian bakers. Not only wheat allergens, but also alpha-amylase must be considered as causative agents, although sensitisation to storage mites is not important in the occupational allergic response. Atopy must be regarded as an important predisposing factor for <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisation</b> to occupational allergens and for the onset of symptoms at work. The data confirm that for effective prevention, greater care should be taken not only in limiting environmental exposure, but also in identifying susceptible people...|$|E
