5|$|According to Znaniecki, {{sociology}} can {{be divided}} into the study of four dynamic <b>social</b> systems: <b>social</b> action theory, <b>social</b> relation theory, <b>social</b> actors theory, and <b>social</b> groups theory. Znaniecki saw <b>social</b> actions as the foundation of a society, as they give rise to more complex <b>social</b> relations, and he saw this theory as the foundation of all the others. Unlike Max Weber, he did not believe that everything can be reduced to <b>social</b> actions; he was also quite skeptical of any insights coming from the science of psychology, which he held in low esteem.|$|E

5|$|<b>Social</b> {{anthropology}} is {{the branch}} of anthropology that studies how contemporary living human beings behave in <b>social</b> groups. Practitioners of <b>social</b> anthropology, like sociologists, investigate various facets of <b>social</b> organization. Traditionally, <b>social</b> anthropologists analysed non-industrial and non-Western societies, whereas sociologists focused on industrialized societies in the Western world. In recent years, however, <b>social</b> anthropology has expanded its focus to modern Western societies, meaning that the two disciplines increasingly converge.|$|E

5|$|Sociologists {{increasingly}} {{draw upon}} computationally intensive methods to analyse and model <b>social</b> phenomena. Using computer simulations, artificial intelligence, text mining, complex statistical methods, and new analytic approaches like <b>social</b> network analysis and <b>social</b> sequence analysis, computational sociology develops and tests theories of complex <b>social</b> processes through bottom-up modelling of <b>social</b> interactions.|$|E
5|$|Sociology is the {{scientific}} study of society, including patterns of <b>social</b> relationships, <b>social</b> interaction, and culture. It is a <b>social</b> science that uses various methods of empirical investigation and critical analysis to develop a body of knowledge about <b>social</b> order, acceptance, and change. Many sociologists aim to conduct research that may be applied directly to <b>social</b> policy and welfare, while others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of <b>social</b> processes. Subject matter ranges from the micro-sociology level of individual agency and interaction to the macro level of systems and the <b>social</b> structure.|$|E
