The manipulator is part of a team of heterogeneous mobile robots that are to search and identify <b>sample</b> <b>containers</b> in an unknown environment. A map of the environment along with possible positions of <b>sample</b> <b>containers</b> are shared between the robots in the team by using a cloud-based communication interface. To grasp a container with its manipulator arm the robot has to place itself in a position suitable for the manipulation task. This optimal base placement pose is selected by querying a precomputed inverse reachability database...|$|R

5000|$|The {{second problem}} occurs as {{the sample is}} removed from the water source and begins to {{establish}} chemical equilibrium with its new surroundings - the <b>sample</b> <b>container.</b> Sample containers must be made of materials with minimal reactivity with substances to be measured; and pre-cleaning of sample containers is important. The water sample may dissolve part of the <b>sample</b> <b>container</b> and any residue on that container, or chemicals dissolved in the water sample may sorb onto the <b>sample</b> <b>container</b> and remain there when the water is poured out for analysis. Similar physical and chemical interactions may take place with any pumps, piping, or intermediate devices used to transfer the water sample into the <b>sample</b> <b>container.</b> Water collected from depths below the surface will normally be held at the reduced pressure of the atmosphere; so gas dissolved in the water may escape into unfilled space {{at the top of the}} container. Atmospheric gas present in that air space may also dissolve into the water sample. Other chemical reaction equilibria may change if the water sample changes temperature. Finely divided solid particles formerly suspended by water turbulence may settle to the bottom of the <b>sample</b> <b>container,</b> or a solid phase may form from biological growth or chemical precipitation. Microorganisms within the water sample may biochemically alter concentrations of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and organic compounds. Changing carbon dioxide concentrations may alter pH and change solubility of chemicals of interest. These problems are of special concern during measurement of chemicals assumed to be significant at very low concentrations.|$|E

50|$|Part of {{the sample}} return mission would be to prevent contact between the Martian {{environment}} and {{the exterior of the}} <b>sample</b> <b>container.</b> In order to eliminate the risk of parachute failure, the current plan is to use the thermal protection system to cushion the capsule upon impact (at terminal velocity). The <b>sample</b> <b>container</b> will be designed to withstand the force of the impact. To receive the returned samples, NASA proposed a specially designed Biosafety Level 4 containment facility, the Mars Sample Return Receiving facility (MSRRF). Not knowing what properties (e.g., size) any Martian organisms might exhibit is a complication in design of such a facility.|$|E

5000|$|The core {{function}} of LIMS {{has traditionally been}} the management of samples. This typically is initiated when a sample is received in the laboratory, {{at which point the}} sample will be registered in the LIMS. Some LIMS will allow the customer to place an [...] "order" [...] for a sample directly to the LIMS at which point the sample is generated in an [...] "unreceived" [...] state. The processing could then include a step where the <b>sample</b> <b>container</b> is registered and sent to the customer for the sample to be taken and then returned to the lab. The registration process may involve accessioning the sample and producing barcodes to affix to the <b>sample</b> <b>container.</b> Various other parameters such as clinical or phenotypic information corresponding with the sample are also often recorded. The LIMS then tracks chain of custody as well as sample location. Location tracking usually involves assigning the sample to a particular freezer location, often down to the granular level of shelf, rack, box, row, and column. Other event tracking such as freeze and thaw cycles that a sample undergoes in the laboratory may be required.|$|E

50|$|Figure 1 {{depicts the}} {{current version of}} the SOFIA system.

The linear arrays (101) comprise a plurality of optical fibers having a first end and a second end, the plurality of optical fibers optionally surrounded by a protective and/or insulating sheath. The optical fibers are linearly arranged, meaning that they are substantially coplanar with respect to one another so as to form an elongated row of fibers.|$|E

40|$|Cationic membrane-active {{peptides}} {{have been}} studied for years {{in the hope of}} developing them into novel types of therapeutics. In this article, we investigate an effect that might have significant experimental implications for investigators who wish to study these peptides, namely, that the peptides adsorb to solid surfaces of glass and plastic. Specifically, we use analytical HPLC to systematically quantify the adsorption of the three cationic membrane-active peptides mastoparan X, melittin, and magainin 2 to the walls of commonly used glass and plastic <b>sample</b> <b>containers.</b> Our results show that, at typical experimental peptide concentrations, 90 % or more of the peptides might be lost from solution due to rapid adsorption to the walls of the <b>sample</b> <b>containers.</b> Thus, our results emphasize that investigators should always keep these adsorption effects in mind when designing and interpreting experiments on cationic membrane-active peptides. We conclude the article by discussing different strategies for reducing the experimental impact of these adsorption effects...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. A partially-automated {{parboiling}} unit (PU) {{that can}} process approximately 2 kg of rough rice per cycle was recently developed and is described. The system components include {{a stainless steel}} tank (40 -cm long; 20 -cm internal diameter), a water-circulation pump, a hot-water supply tank, a steam regulator, four cylindrical <b>sample</b> <b>containers,</b> and a computer interface. The processing performance of the PU was evaluated using rough rice of the long-grain cultivar CL 151 obtained from two growing locations. Sample size and location of the <b>sample</b> <b>containers</b> in the tank were the vari-ables considered in the performance tests. The processing conditions were: soaking at 70 °C and 138 kPag (20 psig) for 2 h; steaming at 120 °C and 69 kPag (10 psig) for 10 min; and gentle drying at 26 °C and 65 % relative humidity until a mois-ture content of ~ 12 % was attained. The quality attributes of the parboiled product were compared with those obtained by a laboratory-scale parboiling procedure that employed autoclave steaming. Differences {{in the percentage of}} deformed kernels were observed due to the effect of sample size and location of the <b>sample</b> <b>containers</b> in the tank. Milling yields and milled kernel color were minimally affected. In general, the quality attributes of parboiled rice obtained by the PU were either similar or better than those of the product obtained by autoclave steaming. Automated process operations (soaking, draining, and steaming), small sample size requirements, and good reproducibility are some key features that make the PU a valuable tool for rice parboiling and general processing research...|$|R
