50|$|In a <b>squarewave</b> voltammetric experiment, {{the current}} at a (usually stationary) working {{electrode}} is measured while the potential between the working electrode and a reference electrode is swept linearly in time. The potential waveform {{can be viewed}} as a superposition of a regular <b>squarewave</b> onto an underlying staircase (see figure above); in this sense, SWV can be considered a modification of staircase voltammetry.|$|E
50|$|<b>Squarewave</b> voltammetry (SWV) {{is a form}} {{of linear}} {{potential}} sweep voltammetry which has found numerous applications in various fields, including within medicinal and various sensing communities.|$|E
50|$|Many linear {{encoders}} interpolate the analogue sine/cosine {{signals in}} order to sub-divide the scale period, providing a higher measurement resolution. The output of the interpolation process is quadrature <b>squarewaves</b> - the distance between edges of the two channels being {{the resolution of the}} encoder. The reference mark or index pulse will also be processed digitally and will be a pulse, usually one to four units-of-resolution wide.|$|R

Its piano, violin, flute and guitar timbres were nearly unrecognizable abstractions of real instruments. It also featured a [...] "fantasy" [...] voice, and a programmable synthesizer which provided for choice of both oscillator waveform and ADSR envelope. The synthesizer was programmed by entering a number into the calculator section's memory, then switching back to keyboard mode. It had {{a range of}} {{two and a half}} octaves.|$|R
50|$|By contrast, {{in normal}} pulse voltammetry the current {{resulting}} {{from a series of}} ever larger potential pulses is compared with the current at a constant 'baseline' voltage. Another type of pulse voltammetry is <b>squarewave</b> voltammetry, which can be considered a special type of differential pulse voltammetry in which equal time is spent at the potential of the ramped baseline and potential of the superimposed pulse.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to note that in <b>squarewave</b> volammetric analyses, the diffusion layer is not renewed between potential cycles. Thus, it is not possible/accurate to view each cycle in isolation; the conditions present for each cycle is a complex diffusion layer which has evolved through all prior potential cycles. The conditions for a particular cycle are also a function of electrode kinetics, along with other electrochemical considerations.|$|E
50|$|In the {{frequency}} domain, clipping produces strong harmonics {{in the high}} frequency range (as the clipped waveform comes closer to a <b>squarewave).</b> The extra high frequency weighting of the signal could make tweeter damage more likely than if the signal was not clipped. However most loudspeakers are designed to handle signals like cymbal crashes that have even more high frequency weighting than amplifier clipping produces, so damage attributable to this characteristic is rare.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe have {{measured}} sensitivity for discriminating {{the spatial}} phase of multi-harmonic and two-harmonic patterns modulated either in luminance or in chromaticity (red-green). The multiharmonic patterns were either highpass <b>squarewaves,</b> lines or ramps. For all patterns, contrast thresholds for discriminating 0 from 180 deg phase {{were similar to}} those for discriminating − 90 from 90 deg, for luminance or chromatic modulation (or both). For all types of multi-harmonic patterns, the ratio of contrast thresholds for the phase discrimination to that for pattern detection was the same for luminance and chromatic modulation, and for combinations of both. Similarly, phase thresholds, the minimum detectable differences in phase (about a mean 0 deg), were the same for chromatic and luminance patterns, provided that contrast was scaled to equate detection thresholds of the patterns. Similar results were observed for simple three-harmonic patterns (f + 2 f + 3 f), and for (f + 2 f) two-harmonic patterns. Strangely, however, two-harmonic patterns of f + 3 f (first two terms of square-wave) of moderate to high spatial frequency did show a two-fold advantage for luminance over colour, as Troscianko and Harris (1988) have previously reported (Vision Research, 28, 1041 – 1049), possibly because the two harmonics have a greater separation in frequency. However, for most classes of patterns, sensitivity for spatial phase is as good for chromatic as for luminance modulation, suggesting that similar sorts of mechanisms operate under these two conditions...|$|R
50|$|Anodic {{stripping}} voltammetry is a {{voltammetric method}} for quantitative determination of specific ionic species. The analyte {{of interest is}} electroplated on the working electrode during a deposition step, and oxidized from the electrode during the stripping step. The current is measured during the stripping step. The oxidation of species is registered as a peak in the current signal at the potential at which the species begins to be oxidized. The stripping step can be either linear, staircase, <b>squarewave,</b> or pulse.|$|E
50|$|Profile {{ignition}} pickup (PIP) is {{the term}} used for the signal sent from the Ford EDIS to the electronic control module (ECM). This signal is the digitally modified signal that originated from the Crank Angle Sensor (CAS) in an alternating current format. The PIP signal into the ECM is a <b>squarewave</b> switched at 12 volts and is the ECM's reference for engine speed (rpm) and position. The PIP signal when receive by the ECM can then be modified {{to take into account}} the ignition timing advance.|$|E
50|$|Cathodic {{stripping}} voltammetry is a {{voltammetric method}} for quantitative determination of specific ionic species. It {{is similar to}} the trace analysis method anodic stripping voltammetry, except that for the plating step, the potential is held at an oxidizing potential, and the oxidized species are stripped from the electrode by sweeping the potential positively. This technique is used for ionic species that form insoluble salts and will deposit on or near the anodic, working electrode during deposition. The stripping step can be either linear, staircase, <b>squarewave,</b> or pulse.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the minimal}} {{contributions}} from non-faradaic currents, {{the use of}} a differential current plot instead of separate forward and reverse current plots, and significant time evolution between potential reversal and current sampling, high sensitivity screening can be obtained utilizing SWV. For this reason, <b>squarewave</b> voltammetry has been utilized in numerous electrochemical measurements and can be viewed as an improvement to other electroanalytical techniques. For instance, SWV suppressed background currents much more effectively than cyclic voltammetry - for this reason, analyte concentrations on the nanomolar scale can be registered utilizing SWV over CV.|$|E
5000|$|Fuzz: A fuzz pedal or [...] "fuzzbox" [...] {{is a type}} of {{overdrive}} pedal that clips a sound-wave {{until it}} is nearly a <b>squarewave,</b> resulting in a heavily distorted or [...] "fuzzy" [...] sound. Fuzzboxes may contain frequency multiplier circuitry to achieve a harsh timbre by adding complex harmonics. The Rolling Stones' [...] "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" [...] greatly popularized the use of fuzz effects. Fuzz bass (also called [...] "bass overdrive") is a style of playing the electric bass that produces a buzzy, overdriven sound via a tube or transistor amp or by using a fuzz or overdrive pedal.|$|E
50|$|The {{current is}} sampled at two times - {{once at the}} end of the forward {{potential}} pulse and again {{at the end of}} the reverse potential pulse (in both cases immediately before the potential direction is reversed). As a result of this current sampling technique, the contribution to the current signal resulting from capacitive (sometimes referred to as non-faradaic or charging) current is minimal. As a result of having current sampling at two different instances per <b>squarewave</b> cycle, two current waveforms are collected - both have diagnostic value, and are therefore preserved. When viewed in isolation, the forward and reverse current waveforms mimic the appearance of a cyclic voltammogram (which corresponds to the anodic or cathodic halves, however, is dependent upon experimental conditions).|$|E
50|$|However, in {{the cells}} invented by Gilbert, shown in these figures, {{there are two}} {{additional}} diodes. This is a crucial difference, because they generate the logarithm of the associated differential (X) input current {{in such a way}} that the exponential characteristics of the following transistors result in an ideally perfect multiplication of these input currents with the remaining pair of (Y) currents. This additional diode cell topology is typically used when a low distortion VCA (Voltage Controlled Amplifier) is required. This topology is rarely used in RF mixer/modulator applications, for a variety of reasons. one being that the linearity advantage of the top linearized cascode is minimal due to the near-square wave drive signals to these bases. At very high frequencies, the drive is less likely to be a fast-edge <b>squarewave,</b> when there may be some advantage in the linearization.|$|E
50|$|When first {{reported}} by Barker in 1957, the working electrode utilized {{was primarily a}} dropping mercury electrode (DME). When using a DME, the surface area of the mercury drop is constantly changing {{throughout the course of}} the experiment; for this reason, complex mathematical modeling was at times required in order to analyze collected electrochemical data. The <b>squarewave</b> voltammetric technique allowed for the collection of the desired electrochemical data within one mercury drop, meaning that the need for mathematical modeling to account for the changing working electrode surface area was no longer needed. In short, the introduction and development of this technique allowed for the rapid collection of reliable and easily reproducible electrochemical data using DME or SDME working electrodes. With continued improvements from many electrochemists (particularly the Osteryoungs), SWV {{is now one of the}} primary voltammetric techniques available on modern potentiostats.|$|E

50|$|When {{the stimuli}} used to present phantom {{contours}} consist of adjacent {{dark and light}} achromatic horizontal stripes (<b>squarewave</b> gratings), variations in spatial and temporal frequency can be examined. An increase or decrease in stripe thickness adjusts spatial frequency, and temporal frequency is manipulated by increases and decreases in flicker rate. Findings show that as spatial frequency is increased, sensitivity to temporal frequency decreases. For example, with a temporal frequency of 7 Hz, the spatial frequency required in order for subjects to perceive the phantom contour was 8.96 cycles degree −1. Subjects {{lost the ability to}} detect temporal phase when temporal frequency was above 7 Hz, indicating they relied on some other cue to detect phantom contours. This finding suggests that where phantom contours are processed along the visual system may change, depending on which pattern-detection technique is being utilized. Keily et al. looked at stimulus duration, with relation to presentation of flickering images, and found no detection improvement between 34 and 340 milliseconds, suggesting that the first couple of flicker frames are crucial to phantom contour perception.|$|E
40|$|We have {{examined}} how color appearance varies with spatial pattern. Subjects set color-matches between a uniform, 2 deg matching field and bars within <b>squarewave</b> patterns (1, 2 and 4 c/deg) or the superposition of these squarewaves. The matches were set using squarewaves and <b>squarewave</b> mixtures with many different colors and contrasts. The color-matches satisfied the basic properties of a linear system {{to within a}} tolerance of twice the precision of repeated matches.

40|$|Adaptation {{to a high}} {{contrast}} sinewave grating of 1 c/deg spatial frequency causes a large increase in the contrast threshold for a 1 c/deg test grating, but fails to raise the threshold for a <b>squarewave</b> grating of 0. 33 c/deg, although {{the sensitivity of the}} “channel” tuned to both the third and fifth harmonic components of the <b>squarewave</b> test grating should be thoroughly suppressed. Following sequential adaptation to sinewave gratings of 1 and 3 c/deg spatial frequency, detection of <b>squarewave</b> gratings at 0. 33 c/deg likewise remains unaffected. In contrast, after adaptation to a 0. 33 c/deg <b>squarewave</b> grating with missing fundamental the contrast threshold for a <b>squarewave</b> test grating of the same frequency is increased by 0. 25 log unit, although the higher harmonic component frequencies are less affected than by sequential sinewave adaptation.

40|$|Graduation date: 2010 Abstract: Various {{applications}} like wireless UWB communication, fast {{data acquisition}} systems and digital storage oscilloscopes needs ADCs with instantaneous input signal bandwidth from 0. 1 - 40 GigaHertz range with 6 - 10 bits of resolution [...] a challenging task and an impressive goal to achieve. Flash ADCs have been conventionally employed {{to achieve these}} goals but have been proved to be power hungry and ineffective for higher resolution. Time-interleaved converters are another option that relax the device speed and circuit complexity. Current research shows that at high input frequencies in the MultiGigaHertz range, the performance of these time-interleaved high speed ADCs is limited mainly by the sampling clock jitter. In this work, the effect of clock jitter on the data acquisition for a sampled data system is analyzed and discussed. Under the premise that, for a given jitter specification, it {{is relatively easy to}} generate a clean high frequency sinusoidal signal than a high frequency <b>squarewave</b> signal, this proposed work makes use of a clean sinusoid as the sampling clock. This high frequency sinusoidal clock, embedded with low frequency <b>squarewave</b> clocks, is employed in a proposed bottom plate sampling Track-and-Hold (T/H) architecture with the aim of improving the SNR at multi-GigaHertz frequencies. A comparative study on the performance of this T/H circuit (SNDR,ENOB) for sinusoidal sampling and conventional <b>squarewave</b> sampling is presented. The work concludes that for high frequency sampled data acquisition system, where sampling clock with sub- 1 ps jitter values are needed, the presented scheme of sinusoidal sampling is advantageous for reducing sampling clock uncertainty when compared against the conventional <b>squarewave</b> sampling technique...|$|E

The basic equation is derived from its equivalent circuit. Solving the basic equation with steady state conditions, the instaneous value of the load current i is derived. The period t(2) for which the current flows from the supply to the load and the period t(l) for which the current feedbacks through diodes from the load to the supply are calculated from (i), and the ratio of t(l) to t(2) is illustrated using power factor of fundamental wave, pf, as a variable. The ratios of transistor mean current I(tr), diode mean current I(D), supply mean current I(s) to the load current I are illustrated using pf as a variable, too. In result, each current ratios to I is shown in simple expressione. The load current can be calculated simply using the coefficient reading off the figure. In addition, it becomes clear from the figure that the load current is scarcely influenced by the harmonic voltage in less than 0. 8 of pf.
