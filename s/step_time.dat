40|$|Adaptive time-stepping methods {{based on}} the Monte Carlo Euler method for weak {{approximation}} of Itô stochastic differential equations are developed. The main result is new expansions of the computational error, with computable leading-order term in a posteriori form, based on stochastic flows and discrete dual backward problems. The expansions lead to efficient and accurate computation of error estimates. Adaptive algorithms for either stochastic <b>time</b> <b>steps</b> or deterministic <b>time</b> <b>steps</b> are described. Numerical examples illustrate when stochastic and deterministic adaptive <b>time</b> <b>steps</b> are superior to constant <b>time</b> <b>steps</b> and when adaptive stochastic steps are superior to adaptive deterministic <b>steps.</b> Stochastic <b>time</b> <b>steps</b> use Brownian bridges and require more work for a given number of <b>time</b> <b>steps.</b> Deterministic <b>time</b> <b>steps</b> may yield more <b>time</b> <b>steps</b> but require less work; for example, {{in the limit of}} vanishing error tolerance, the ratio of the computational error and its computable estimate tends to 1 with negligible additional work to determine the adaptive deterministic <b>time</b> <b>steps...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{duration}} of the folding process varies dramatically depending on the protein of interest. When studied outside the cell, the slowest folding proteins require many minutes or hours to fold primarily due to proline isomerization, and must pass {{through a number of}} intermediate states, like checkpoints, before the process is complete. On the other hand, very small single-domain proteins with lengths of up to a hundred amino acids typically fold in a single <b>step.</b> <b>Time</b> scales of milliseconds are the norm and the very fastest known protein folding reactions are complete within a few microseconds.|$|E

The rhythm track is composed by combining any of 100 rhythm patterns, {{each of which}} can be edited independently. These patterns, however, are shared between songs.

To {{set the time}} values, one must first set a time base, typically 120. This means that a quarter note = 120, a sixteenth note = 30, an eighth note = 60, etc. Esoteric timings can be programmed by entering any number against whatever time base is entered. The third programming concept is the gate time. This gate time refers to the actual sounded value; whether the phrasing is legato, staccato, semi detached etc.|$|E

If a sequence is programmed while the MC-4 is set to the default TB it will never sync correctly to Din or MIDI clock. To sync correctly the MC-4 TB needs to be set as 48/12/6, this sets the MC-4 for Din sync and defaults the <b>step</b> <b>time</b> to 16ths (12 clocks) and the gate length to 32nds (6 clocks).|$|E

5000|$|It {{is usually}} {{required}} that the controller for a given plant should be designed under some practical limitations.The controller is desired to be of minimum degree, minimum phase (if possible) and stable. It must have enough bandwidth and power rating limitations.

5000|$|In a {{magnetized}} plasma, {{the collision}} frequency is usually {{small compared to}} the gyrofrequency, so that the step size is the gyroradius [...] and the <b>step</b> <b>time</b> is the collision time, , which {{is related to the}} collision frequency through , leading to [...] If the collision frequency is larger than the gyrofrequency, then the particles can be considered to move freely with the thermal velocity vth between collisions, and the diffusion coefficient takes the form [...] Evidently the classical (collisional) diffusion is maximum when the collision frequency is equal to the gyrofrequency, in which case D = ρ²ωc = vth²/ωc. Substituting ρ = vth/ωc, vth = (kBT/m)1/2, and ωc = eB/m, we arrive at D = kBT/eB, which is the Bohm scaling. Considering the approximate nature of this derivation, the missing 1/16 in front is no cause for concern. Therefore, at least within a factor of order unity, Bohm diffusion is always greater than classical diffusion.|$|E

50|$|Biomechanical {{and motor}} control {{alterations}} of gait in Parkinson’s patients {{are due to}} the hypokinesia which reduces the movement speed and size. The main biomechanical changes in seen in walking are: decreased or abnormal arm rotation, decreased trunk rotation, forward stooped posture, decreased movements at hip, knee and ankle joints invariably producing decreased ground clearance, excessive knee flexion throughout gait cycle, decreased stride and step length and decreased gait speed. They face problem in taking sharp turns due to decreased double support time that controls trunk momentum during the observed large swing phase and COM {{is closer to the}} limits of stability. There is marked dysrhythmicity seen bilaterally due to variability in stride and swing time. However, with higher walking speed the dysrhythmicity seen will be due to swing time as it is independent of the walking speed. During the ON phase of the Dopaminergic treatment there is increase in gait speed and step length. Cadence and the temporal variables remain unaffected by the Dopamine treatment. However, Dopamine replacements produce inherent variability in Sensorimotor system. As a result, medicated PD patients shows more variability in their gait characteristics than the nonmedicated patients especially in cadence, <b>step</b> <b>time</b> and double support time.|$|E
40|$|Background. Increased <b>step</b> <b>time</b> variability, {{particularly}} on an irregular surface, {{has been associated}} with impaired mobility function and a variety of diseases. However the biomechanical necessity, or advantage, of increasing <b>step</b> <b>time</b> variability has not been identified. Methods. We performed a secondary analysis of gait data previously obtained on 42 subjects age 50 or older with neuropathy who walked on smooth and irregular surfaces, the latter with and without three interventions (cane, ankle orthosis and wall touch) that provided frontal plane support. Findings. <b>Step</b> <b>time</b> variability on smooth and irregular surfaces was most strongly associated with reduction in step length on the irregular surface as compared to the smooth. More specifically, the greater the decrease in step length on the irregular surface the greater the <b>step</b> <b>time</b> variability on both surfaces and the greater the increase in <b>step</b> <b>time</b> variability on the irregular surface. The increase in step length on the irregular surface afforded by the interventions coincided with a decrease in <b>step</b> <b>time</b> variability. The subjects did not simultaneously demonstrate increased <b>step</b> <b>time</b> variability and step width range on the irregular surface. Interpretation. Among adults age 50 and older with neuropathy, increased <b>step</b> <b>time</b> variability is strongly associated with the need to shorten step length on an irregular surface. Therefore <b>step</b> <b>time</b> variability may be a marker for instability during single limb stance which necessitates rapidly placed, shortened recovery steps. Such steps may also offer the advantage of reducing extremes in lateral foot placement of the swing limb, and so assist in maintaining frontal plane stability...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of the lateral amplitude and regularity of upper body fluctuation on <b>step</b> <b>time</b> variability. Return map analysis was used to clarify the relationship between <b>step</b> <b>time</b> variability and a history of falling. Eleven healthy, community-dwelling older adults and twelve younger adults participated in the study. All of the subjects walked 25 m at a comfortable speed.

The normalized average magnitude of acceleration, the coefficient of determination ($R^ 2 $) of the return map, and the <b>step</b> <b>time</b> variabilities, were calculated. Cluster analysis using the average fluctuation and the regularity of C 7 fluctuation identified four walking patterns in the mediolateral (ML) direction.

Additionally, elderly participants who had fallen in the past year had higher amplitude and a lower regularity of fluctuation during walking.

40|$|In {{this pilot}} study, we {{investigated}} {{the validity and}} reliability of low-cost handheld video camera recordings for measuring gait in people with early stage Parkinson's disease (PD). Five participants with PD, Hoehn & Yahr stage I-II, mean age 66. 2 years and five healthy age-matched controls were recruited. Participants walked across a GAITRite ® electronic walkway at self-selected pace while video was simultaneously recorded. Data from both systems were analyzed and compared. <b>Step</b> <b>time</b> variability, measured from handheld video recordings, revealed significant (p ≤ 0. 05) differences between the gait of early stage PD and controls. Concurrent validity between video analyses and GAITRite were good (ICC(2, 1) ≥ 0. 86) for mean <b>step</b> <b>time</b> and mean dual support duration. However, the inter-assessor reliability for the video analysis was poor for <b>step</b> <b>time</b> variability (ICC(2, 1) = 0. 18). More reliable measurement of <b>step</b> <b>time</b> variability may require a system to measure extended periods of walking. Further research involving longer walks and more participants with higher stages of PD is required to investigate if <b>step</b> <b>time</b> variability can be measured with acceptable reliability using video recordings.
