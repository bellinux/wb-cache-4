The vividly physical insight is presented to interpret the diffraction process for slanted grating. We also present that the simplified modal method with the two-lowest mode condition is effective for a large <b>slanted</b> <b>angle</b> up to 26 degrees. By examining the eignefunction, the mode index, and the two-lowest mode condition, we provide new evidences to verify the assumption that a slanted grating with subwavelength period can be analyzed as an equivalent rectangular grating using the simplified modal method, which is right and convenient to use for a small <b>slanted</b> <b>angle</b> up to 20 degrees. Numerical simulations of the simplified modal method are coincident with rigorous coupled wave analysis for small <b>slanted</b> <b>angle</b> gratings. Thus the simplified modal method {{can be used for}} small <b>slanted</b> <b>angle</b> grating since the equivalence of slanted grating and rectangular grating is verified due to its vivid physical analysis.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a computationally and statistically efficient parametric {{solution to the}} problem of estimating the orientation in space of a planar textured surface from a single, noisy, observed image of it. The coordinate transformation from surface to image coordinates, due to the perspective projection, transforms each homogeneous sinusoidal component of the surface texture into a sinusoid whose frequency is a function of location. The functional dependence of the sinusoid phase in location is uniquely determined by the tilt and <b>slant</b> <b>angles</b> of the surface. From the physical model of the perspective projection, we derive the Cramr [...] Rao lower bound on the error variance of estimating the tilt and slant of the observed surface in the presence of observation noise.

5000|$|Gauss-SIFT [...] {{is a pure}} image {{descriptor}} {{defined by}} performing all image measurements underlying the pure image descriptor in SIFT by Gaussian derivative responses as opposed to derivative approximations in an image pyramid as done in regular SIFT. In this way, discretization effects over space and scale {{can be reduced to}} a minimum allowing for potentially more accurate image descriptors. In Lindeberg (2015) [...] such pure Gauss-SIFT image descriptors were combined with a set of generalized scale-space interest points comprising the Laplacian of the Gaussian, the determinant of the Hessian, four new unsigned or signed Hessian feature strength measures as well as Harris-Laplace and Shi-and-Tomasi interests points. In an extensive experimental evaluation on a poster dataset comprising multiple views of 12 posters over scaling transformations up to a factor of 6 and viewing direction variations up to a <b>slant</b> <b>angle</b> of 45 degrees, it was shown that substantial increase in performance of image matching (higher efficiency scores and lower 1-precision scores) could be obtained by replacing Laplacian of Gaussian interest points by determinant of the Hessian interest points. Since difference-of-Gaussians interest points constitute a numerical approximation of Laplacian of the Gaussian interest points, this shows that a substantial increase in matching performance is possible by replacing the difference-of-Gaussians interest points in SIFT by determinant of the Hessian interest points. Additional increase in performance can furthermore be obtained by considering the unsigned Hessian feature strength measure [...] A quantitative comparison between the Gauss-SIFT descriptor and a corresponding Gauss-SURF descriptor did also show that Gauss-SIFT does generally perform significantly better than Gauss-SURF for a large number of different scale-space interest point detectors. This study therefore shows that discregarding discretization effects the pure image descriptor in SIFT is significantly better than the pure image descriptor in SURF, whereas the underlying interest point detector in SURF, which can be seen as numerical approximation to scale-space extrema of the determinant of the Hessian, is significantly better than the underlying interest point detector in SIFT.|$|E
5000|$|The {{vertical}} angle (or elevation) of a shot will also affect {{the trajectory of}} the shot. Ballistic tables for small calibre projectiles (fired from pistols or rifles) assume a horizontal line of sight between the shooter and target with gravity acting perpendicular to the earth. Therefore, if the shooter-to-target angle is up or down, (the direction of the gravity component does not change with slope direction), then the trajectory curving acceleration due to gravity will actually be less, {{in proportion to the}} cosine of the <b>slant</b> <b>angle.</b> As a result, a projectile fired upward or downward, on a so-called [...] "slant range," [...] will over-shoot the same target distance on flat ground. The effect is of sufficient magnitude that hunters must adjust their target hold off accordingly in mountainous terrain. A well known formula for slant range adjustment to horizontal range hold off is known as the Rifleman's rule. The Rifleman's rule and the slightly more complex and less well known Improved Rifleman's rule models produce sufficiently accurate predictions for many small arms applications. Simple prediction models however ignore minor gravity effects when shooting uphill or downhill. The only practical way to compensate for this is to use a ballistic computer program. Besides gravity at very steep angles over long distances, the effect of air density changes the projectile encounters during flight become problematic.The mathematical prediction models available for inclined fire scenarios, depending on the amount and direction (uphill or downhill) of the inclination angle and range, yield varying accuracy expectation levels.Less advanced ballistic computer programs predict the same trajectory for uphill and downhill shots at the same {{vertical angle}} and range. The more advanced programs factor in the small effect of gravity on uphill and on downhill shots resulting in slightly differing trajectories at the same vertical angle and range. No publicly available ballistic computer program currently (2017) accounts for the complicated phenomena of differing air densities the projectile encounters during flight.|$|E
