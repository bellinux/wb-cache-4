5|$|To {{ensure the}} army {{received}} sufficient recruits, Diocletian {{appears to have}} instituted systematic annual conscription of Roman citizens {{for the first time}} <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman Republic.

5|$|<b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stage road {{avalanches}} and rockfalls often forced closures of the highway, {{partly due}} to the massive disturbance of the land during the road's construction. No attempt was made to remedy this until shortly after the automobile road was built. In the 1930s, as a relief project during the Great Depression, a crew from the Civilian Conservation Corps replanted the slopes around Independence, by then abandoned for two decades.|$|E

5|$|<b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Constituent Assembly in 1823, {{and with}} renewed vigor in 1826 {{with the opening}} of the General Assembly (the Brazilian parliament), there had been an ideological {{struggle}} over the balance of powers wielded by the emperor and legislature in governance. On one side were those who shared PedroI's views, politicians who believed that the monarch should be free to choose ministers, national policies and the direction of government. In opposition were those, then known as the Liberal Party, who believed that cabinets should have the power to set the government's course and should consist of deputies drawn from the majority party who were accountable to the parliament. Strictly speaking, both the party that supported PedroI's government and the Liberal Party advocated Liberalism, and thus constitutional monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Bulgarian {{resistance}} revived {{under the}} rule of the Cometopuli dynasty, but the new emperor Basil II (r. 976–1025) made the submission of the Bulgarians his primary goal. Basil's first expedition against Bulgaria, however, resulted in a humiliating defeat at the Gates of Trajan. For the next few years, the emperor would be preoccupied with internal revolts in Anatolia, while the Bulgarians expanded their realm in the Balkans. The war dragged on for nearly twenty years. The Byzantine victories of Spercheios and Skopje decisively weakened the Bulgarian army, and in annual campaigns, Basil methodically reduced the Bulgarian strongholds. At the Battle of Kleidion in 1014 the Bulgarians were annihilated: their army was captured, and it is said that 99 out of every 100 men were blinded, with the hundredth man left with one eye so he could lead his compatriots home. When Tsar Samuil saw the broken remains of his once formidable army, he died of shock. By 1018, the last Bulgarian strongholds had surrendered, and the country became part of the Empire. This victory restored the Danube frontier, which had not been held <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emperor Heraclius.|$|E
5|$|During this timeframe, they {{produced}} 100-peso banknotes featuring the lamb, Puerto Rico's official emblem. The bank was inaugurated on February 1, 1890, with Juan Róspide y Navarro and José Manuel López Sainz as governor and vice governor respectively. The Royal Decree permitted the issuing of paper money in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 pesos. These banknotes were manufactured by the American Bank Note Company. The original bank {{was located in}} San Juan, with a second one being established in Mayagüez in 1894. Until 1898, the institution issued four series A, B, C and D, though apparently C was put into production after D and didn't circulate under Spanish control. Series D began distribution on December 1, 1894; this became {{the first time that}} the lamb, which had continued being used <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sociedad Anónima de Crédito Mercantil de Puerto Rico, was replaced by the profile of Maria Christina of Austria.

25|$|While at university, Gauss {{independently}} rediscovered {{several important}} theorems.

This was a major discovery in an important field of mathematics; construction problems had occupied mathematicians <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ancient Greeks, and the discovery ultimately led Gauss to choose mathematics instead of philology as a career.|$|E

Nevertheless, the leaders of the Indian National Congress viewed movie media with contempt. It was the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), a Dravidian party, that made extensive use of this media for propaganda purposes. Adversaries of Dravidian parties despised the use of films and screen popularity for political gain, and Congress leaders like K. Kamaraj questioned the possibility of movie stars forming governments.|$|E

During those years of separation from her husband, Kumari's name was associated with Rahul, Gulzar, Dharmendra and Sawan Kumar Tak.|$|E

25|$|After the Russian Revolution and the Russian Civil War the Bolsheviks {{seized power}} in the Russian Empire and {{transformed}} it into the Soviet Union. Religion in the new socialist society was assigned little value by the state, but in particular Russian Orthodox Church was distrusted because of its active supportive of the White Movement. Massive arrests and repressions began immediately. In the Ukrainian SSR (one of the founding republics of the USSR) as early as in December 1918 the first execution {{of the head of}} the Ukrainian Exarchate Metropolitan of Kiev and Halych took place.
