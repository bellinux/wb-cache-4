40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a technique to}} control the position and effective area of the surface acoustic wave (SAW) acting on a fluid in a PDMS microchannel. The acoustic force can be localized at specific areas of the channels using a structured, ultra-thin PDMS foil beneath the microchannel. This setup enables to shape the <b>standing</b> <b>surface</b> acoustic waves (SSAW) only by changing the geometry of the PDMS foil. In this way the effect is independent of {{the design of the}} acoustic transducer and even single interdigitated transducer can be used to excite <b>standing</b> <b>surface</b> acoustic waves. The alignment of the assembly is very flexible allowing for different orientation of the microchannels with respect to the IDT. To demonstrate the significance and versatility of this technique we use a diagonal orientation to separate and wash particles of different size with a total deflection length of several wavelengths...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} W-waveform <b>Standing</b> <b>Surface</b> Acoustic Waves (W-SSAW), and as its application, patterning of {{two groups}} of microparticles with different sizes alternately without fixing firstly patterned particles. W-SSAW is constructed by two <b>standing</b> <b>surface</b> acoustic waves of frequencies f and 2 f. Combined with linear phase modulation to translate Gor'kov potential at a constant speed, W-SSAW can selectively trap particles. The trapped particles follow the moving Gor'kov potential maintaining force equilibrium between Stokes' drag and the radiation force by W-SSAW. There exist two asymmetric equilibrium positions every period, and by the asymmetry, each group of particles is trapped at different equilibrium positions to form an alternate pattern. This technique is extended to two-dimensional alternate patterning by maintaining phase difference 90 ^∘ between X- and Y-directional W-SSAWs. The patterning method utilizing W-SSAW is advantageous over SSAW-based patterning in {{that it does not}} require temporal separation to fix firstly patterned particles...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 The {{formation}} of shear bands in isotropic micropolar elastic materials is considered in this thesis. The investigation concerns localized deformation fields due to jumps of second-order gradients of displacement across a <b>standing</b> singular <b>surface.</b> Such a <b>standing</b> <b>surface</b> {{gives rise to}} a shear band. The condition for the existence of a shear band is obtained in terms of an appropriate acoustic tensor for the micropolar continuum. The behavior of the inclination angle of the shear band is examined under varied loading conditions. Numerical calculations are presented for a micropolar elastic solid in the two cases, of uniaxial tension, and of tension of a thin plate...|$|R

40|$|The {{somatosensory}} system {{plays an important}} role in balance control and age-related declines in somatosensory function have been implicated in falls incidence. Different types of insole devices have been developed to enhance somatosensory information and improve postural stability. However, they are often too complex and expensive to integrate into daily life and textured insole surfaces may provide an inexpensive and accessible means to enhance somatosensory input. This study investigated the effects of textured insole surfaces on postural sway in ten younger and seven older participants performing standing balance tests on a force plate under three insole surface conditions: (1) barefoot; (2) with hard; and (3), soft textured insole surfaces. With each insole surface, participants were tested under two vision conditions (eyes open, closed) on two <b>standing</b> <b>surfaces</b> (firm, foam). Four 30 s trials were collected for different combinations of insole <b>surface,</b> <b>standing</b> <b>surface</b> and vision. Centre of pressure measurements included the range and standard deviation of anterior-posterior and medial-lateral displacement, path length and the 90 % confidence elliptical area. Results revealed a significant Group*Surface*Insole interaction for five of the dependent variables. Compared to younger individuals, postural sway was greater in older people on both <b>standing</b> <b>surfaces</b> in the barefoot condition. However, both textured insole surfaces reduced postural sway for the older group especially in the eyes closed condition on a foam surface. These findings suggest that textured insole surfaces can reduce postural sway in older people, particularly during more challenging balance tasks. Textured insole surfaces may afford a low-cost means of decreasing postural sway, providing an important intervention in falls prevention...|$|R
