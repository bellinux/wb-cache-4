40|$|Abstract — <b>Service</b> <b>availability</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} closely {{scrutinized}} metrics in offering network services. It is important to costeffectively provision a managed and differentiated network with various <b>service</b> <b>availability</b> guarantees under a unified platform. In particular, demands for availability may be elastic and such elasticity can be leveraged to improve cost-effectiveness. In this paper, we establish the framework of provisioning elastic <b>service</b> <b>availability</b> through network utility maximization, and propose an optimal and distributed solution using differentiated failure recovery schemes. First, we develop a utility function with configurable parameters to represent the satisfaction perceived by a user upon <b>service</b> <b>availability</b> as well as its allowed source rate. Second, adopting Quality of Protection [1] and shared path protection, we transform optimal provisioning of elastic <b>service</b> <b>availability</b> into a convex optimization problem. The desirable <b>service</b> <b>availability</b> and source rate for each user can be achieved using a price-based distributed algorithm. Finally, we numerically show the tradeoff between the throughput and the <b>service</b> <b>availability</b> obtained by users in various network topologies. This investigation quantifies several engineering implications. For example, indiscriminately provisioning <b>service</b> <b>availabilities</b> for different kinds of users within one network leads to noteworthy sub-optimality in total network utility. The profile of bandwidth usage also illustrates that provisioning high <b>service</b> <b>availability</b> exclusively for critical applications leads to significant waste in bandwidth resource...|$|R

In restricted cases, it is shown that the problem is decidable, but is NP-complete. The problem of <b>service</b> <b>availability</b> is then extended to nondeterministic systems. Finally, it is shown that a number of important cases can be studied in a cohesive manner based on our proposed formalism.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present and analyse a {{coloured}} stochastic Petri net {{model of a}} redundant fault-tolerant system. As our measure of interest {{we are interested in}} a dependability metric, i. e., <b>service</b> <b>availability.</b> <b>Service</b> <b>availability</b> is defined as the number of successfully completed jobs relative to the total number of arrived jobs. This paper is the first step towards a comprehensive comparison of redundancy and rejuvenation, i. e., the preventive restart of servers when studying <b>service</b> <b>availability.</b> The question we strive to answer in this paper is whether and to what degree additional redundant servers can increase <b>service</b> <b>availability</b> in all load scenarios. We find that the first redundant server improves <b>service</b> <b>availability</b> by almost 90 % in a highly loaded system, while adding a second and third redundant server yields further but much lower improvement.

40|$|Information Technology service {{providers}} aim at attracting customers by providing services that meet {{a high level}} of quality. They should not only satisfy functional requirements, but also non-functional requirements. An important non-functional requirement is the level of <b>service</b> <b>availability.</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Availability</b> Forum (SAForum), a consortium of communications and computing companies, has developed a set of services and standard Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) {{to address the issue of}} high availability for the Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) -based systems and enable portability. Among the services standardized by the SAForum, the Availability Management Framework (AMF) has the important role of ensuring the high availability of an application and its services, by managing the redundant application components deployed on the cluster. To achieve this task, AMF requires a configuration that represents the logical organization of the application components and their services. The design of AMF configurations is a complex and error prone task. Automation of the process is the first step towards improving the quality of such configurations. It also enables exploring different potential solutions for a given set of requirements. An automated approach to generate configurations for applications to deploy on top of the SAForum middleware has been proposed in the context of the MAGIC project. This approach, however, may generate several configurations among which some may not meet the required level of <b>service</b> <b>availability.</b> Therefore, the system designer needs to evaluate the generated configurations using an availability analysis tool to select an appropriate one for deployment. One may want to improve this process by targeting directly in the generation process, the configurations that can guarantee the requested level of <b>service</b> <b>availability.</b> The objective of this thesis is to propose solutions to enhance this configuration generation process and generate configurations that can guarantee the required level of <b>service</b> <b>availability</b> without using advanced analysis tools. For this purpose, we propose configuration design patterns to improve the expected level of <b>service</b> <b>availability</b> and quantitative methods that eliminate some configurations that do not meet the availability requirement. The configuration design patterns improve the expected level of <b>service</b> <b>availability</b> by selecting the best configuration options. The methods estimate <b>service</b> <b>availability</b> for the different possible combinations of software components, which can provide the requested services, taking into account the properties of these components and the behavior of the SAForum middleware. As a proof of concept, we have embedded our proposed solutions into a prototype tool as an eclipse plug-in and validated our work with case studies...|$|R
