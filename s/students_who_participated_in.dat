Analyst Petar Klisarov has voiced his disapproval of the demonstrators (especially the emigrant <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> protests on 26 December 2013 and 3 January 2014) for flaunting Bulgarian legal regulations, for example by behaving disrespectfully towards police officers and blocking the city traffic on a whim, suggesting that they would have been much more disciplined and law-abiding if the activities were taking place abroad. Sofia mayor Yordanka Fandakova is also claimed to have been overly permissive of the demonstrators at the expense of the other members of society.|$|E

Casale was reportedly [...] "standing about [...] away" [...] from Allison Krause when she was shot, and was friends with her and another one of the students who were killed.

2500|$|Furthermore, {{this can}} also occur when {{minorities}} living {{in rural areas}} undergoing urbanization, are introduced to fast food. A study done in Thailand focused on urbanized metropolitan areas, the <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> this study as were diagnosed as “non-obese” in their early life according to their BMI, however were increasingly at risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes, or obesity as adults, as opposed to young adults who lived in more rural areas during their early life. Therefore, early exposure to urbanized regions can encourage unhealthy eating due to widespread presence of inexpensive fast food. [...] Different racial populations that originate from more rural areas and then immigrate to the urbanized metropolitan areas can develop a fixation for a more westernized diet; [...] this change in lifestyle typically occurs due to loss of traditional values when adapting to a new environment. For example, a 2009 study named CYKIDS was based on children from Cyprus, a country east of the mediterranean sea, who were evaluated by the KIDMED index to test their adherence to a mediterranean diet after changing from rural residence to an urban residence. It was found that children in urban areas swapped their traditional dietary patterns for a diet favoring fast food.|$|E
