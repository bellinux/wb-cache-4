25|$|For {{five years}} the boat lift {{operated}} successfully, the longest closures being during spells of cold weather when the canal froze over. In 1882 a cast iron hydraulic cylinder burst while the caisson it supported was at canal level with a boat in it. The caisson descended rapidly, but water escaping from the burst cylinder slowed the rate of descent and the water-filled dock at river level softened the impact. No-one was hurt {{and there was no}} damage to the lift's superstructure. As a precaution, tests were carried out on the second hydraulic cylinder. During these tests the <b>second</b> <b>cylinder</b> failed too. As a result the boat lift was closed for six months while sections of both cylinders were replaced and the connecting pipework, which was thought to have contributed to their failure, was redesigned.|$|E
25|$|The <b>second</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{begins with}} a {{narrative}} hymn starting with a prayer to the Annanuki. Gudea then announces the house ready for the accommodation of Ningirsu and his wife Bau. Food and drink are prepared, incense is lit and a ceremony is organized to welcome the gods into their home. The city is then judged again {{and a number of}} deities are appointed by Enki to fill various positions within the structure. These include a gatekeeper, bailiff, butler, chamberlain, coachman, goatherd, gamekeeper, grain and fisheries inspectors, musicians, armourers and a messenger. After a scene of sacred marriage between Ningirsu and Bau, a seven-day celebration is given by Gudea for Ningirsu with a banquet dedicated to Anu, Enlil and Ninmah (Ninhursag), the major gods of Sumer, who are all in attendance. The text closes with lines of praise for Ningirsu and the Eninnu temple.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>second</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{was added}} to Hyper No. 1 to make a horizontal-opposed engine for {{evaluation}} of an opposed-piston 12-cylinder engine. After running the modified engine with different combinations of cylinder bore and stroke, {{it was found that}} the high coolant temperatures required to maintain the required output were impractical. A third high-performance single-cylinder engine was then constructed with lower operating parameters. This one-cylinder engine was designated [...] "Hyper No. 2", and became the test bed for developing the cylinders that would become the Continental O-1430 ("O" [...] for [...] "opposed") engine. It would require a ten-year development period which changed the layout to first an upright V-12 engine and later, an inverted V-12 engine, before becoming reliable enough to consider for full production as the Continental I-1430 in 1943.|$|E

60|$|A {{few seconds}} after midnight {{the crowd in}} the Chertsey road, Woking, saw a star fall from heaven into the pine woods to the northwest. It had a greenish colour, and caused a silent {{brightness}} like summer lightning. This was the <b>second</b> <b>cylinder.</b>|$|E
60|$|About {{three o'clock}} there began the thud {{of a gun}} at {{measured}} intervals from Chertsey or Addlestone. I learned that the smouldering pine wood into which the <b>second</b> <b>cylinder</b> had fallen was being shelled, {{in the hope of}} destroying that object before it opened. It was only about five, however, that a field gun reached Chobham for use against the first body of Martians.|$|E

60|$|In a {{few minutes}} there was, {{so far as the}} soldier could see, not a living thing left upon the common, and every bush and tree upon it that was not already a {{blackened}} skeleton was burning. The hussars had been on the road beyond the curvature of the ground, and he saw nothing of them. He heard the Martians rattle for a time and then become still. The giant saved Woking station and its cluster of houses until the last; then in a moment the Heat-Ray was brought to bear, and the town became a heap of fiery ruins. Then the Thing shut off the Heat-Ray, and turning its back upon the artilleryman, began to waddle away towards the smouldering pine woods that sheltered the <b>second</b> <b>cylinder.</b> As it did so a second glittering Titan built itself up out of the pit.|$|E

2500|$|A {{compound}} engine is a steam engine which operates cylinders {{through more than}} one stage, i.e., at different pressure levels. Compound engines were a method of improving efficiency. Up until the development of {{compound engine}}s, steam engines used the steam only once before being recycled back to the boiler, but a compound engine recycles the steam into one or more larger, lower-pressure <b>second</b> <b>cylinders</b> first, in order to utilize more of its heat energy. Compound engines could be configured to either increase a ship's economy or its speed. Although broadly speaking a compound engine can refer to a steam engine with any number of different-pressure cylinders, the term usually refers to engines which expand steam through only two stages, i.e. those which operate cylinders at only two different pressures (or [...] "double-expansion" [...] engines).|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The rear {{multi-stage}} cylinder direct-acting hydraulic body hoist {{mechanism is}} widely used in mining dump truck. The working principle of the body hoist mechanism is introduced. The dumping process is simplified through the introduction of “dumping line ” and the variation of ore mass and hoist torque are analyzed. The optimization design {{of the position of}} body hoist mechanism is done using Maple software on the basis of direct search method aimed at minimizing the initial hoist force and the stroke of cylinder and maximizing the hoist force arm when the <b>second</b> stage <b>cylinder</b> starts to stretch out...|$|R
50|$|Split-cycle engines {{separate}} the four strokes of intake, compression, combustion and exhaust into two separate but paired cylinders. The first cylinder {{is used for}} intake and compression. The compressed air is then transferred through a crossover passage from the compression cylinder into the <b>second</b> <b>cylinder,</b> where combustion and exhaust occur. A split-cycle engine is really an air compressor on one side with a combustion chamber on the other.|$|E
50|$|The gun's barrel {{slid back}} on rollers, {{including}} a {{set at the}} muzzle, when the shot was fired. The barrel was attached near the breech to a piston rod extending into an oil-filled cylinder placed just underneath the gun. When the barrel recoiled, the piston was pulled back by the barrel's recoil and thus pushed the oil through a small orifice and into a <b>second</b> <b>cylinder</b> placed underneath. That <b>second</b> <b>cylinder</b> contained a freely floating piston which separated the surging oil from a confined volume of compressed air. During the barrel's recoil the floating piston was forced forward by the oil, compressing the air even further. This action absorbed the recoil progressively as the internal air pressure rose and, {{at the end of}} recoil, generated a strong but decreasing back pressure that returned the gun forward to its original position. The smoothness of this system had no equal in 1897, and for at least another ten years. Each recoil cycle on the French 75, including the return forward, lasted about two seconds, permitting a maximum attainable firing rate of about 30 rounds per minute.|$|E
50|$|In the LBA {{addressing}} scheme, sectors {{are numbered}} as integer indexes; when mapped to CHS (cylinder/head/sector) tuples, LBA numbering {{starts with the}} first cylinder, first head, and track's first sector. Once the track is exhausted, numbering continues to the second head, while staying inside the first cylinder. Once all heads inside the first cylinder are exhausted, numbering continues from the <b>second</b> <b>cylinder,</b> etc. Thus, the lower the LBA value is, the closer the physical sector is to the hard drive's first (that is, outermost) cylinder.|$|E

50|$|Steam under {{pressure}} is converted into mechanical energy more efficiently {{if it is}} used in a compound engine; in such an engine steam from a boiler is used in high-pressure (HP) cylinders and then under reduced pressure in a <b>second</b> set of <b>cylinders.</b> The lower-pressure steam occupies a larger volume and the low-pressure (LP) cylinders are larger than the high-pressure cylinders.|$|R
40|$|One {{method of}} {{improving}} the cold starting characteristics in a direct injection diesel engine, is that named TSCE (Two Stage Combustion EGR). It prevents the induction of a fresh air to half the cylinders of the engine, instead of it using the exhaust gas from the already operating cylinders. This quickens the rise in intake gas temperature of the <b>second</b> stage <b>cylinders,</b> shortens the starting time, and causes a stable combustion at the earlist possible time. As a result, Hydrocarbon mass emission and Aldehide concentration, the main components exhaust pollution, were reduced to 1 / 3 of the amount produced by the usual method of operation, when air, oil and water temperatures − 10 to − 12...|$|R
50|$|It is {{not safe}} {{practice}} to drain one cylinder, retaining the entire reserve in the other, {{in case of}} a catastrophic failure of the <b>second</b> <b>cylinder</b> supply. Sidemount divers are trained to maintain a roughly equal balance of gas supply in each primary cylinder throughout the dive. This ensures that they always retain an equal reserve of gas for donation to an out-of-gas diver; and also helps preserves their stability and lateral trim by maintaining equal buoyancy characteristics in the tanks on either side of their body.|$|E

5000|$|To {{simplify the}} engine and reduce costs, the V-twin {{ignition}} was designed to operate with a single set of points and no distributor.
