5|$|European {{dominance}} was at {{the forefront}} of United's agenda during the 1997–98 season. Having failed to take their chances in a semi-final against eventual champions Borussia Dortmund in 1996–97, Ferguson was resolute to go one <b>step</b> <b>further</b> and emulate Matt Busby's success of 1968, quashing any talk that his team was not good enough.|$|E

5|$|Seasons {{may play}} a role in some regions. A {{dramatic}} change in colour and texture is created by seasonal snowy conditions in northern latitudes, necessitating repainting of vehicles and separate snow oversuits. The Eastern and northern European countries have a tradition for separate winter uniforms rather than oversuits. During the Second World War, the Waffen-SS went a <b>step</b> <b>further,</b> developing reversible uniforms with separate schemes for summer and autumn, as well as white winter oversuits.|$|E
5|$|Caligula's {{religious}} {{policy was}} {{a departure from}} that of his predecessors. According to Cassius Dio, living emperors could be worshipped as divine {{in the east and}} dead emperors could be worshipped as divine in Rome. Augustus had the public worship his spirit on occasion, but Dio describes this as an extreme act that emperors generally shied away from. Caligula took things a <b>step</b> <b>further</b> and had those in Rome, including senators, worship him as a tangible, living god.|$|E
5|$|He uses {{overlapping}} forms {{rather than}} a single form or distinct adjacent forms, which seems {{to create a more}} dynamic feel to the shallow space. However, since Lichtenstein does not uses shading or contrast, the monochromatic strokes with just bold black outlines are void of certain elements of depth. Big Painting No. 6 and Yellow and Green Brushstrokes go one <b>step</b> <b>further</b> in terms of canvas size and dynamic activity that was presented earlier in Little Big Painting.|$|E

Adam is determined to take things one <b>step</b> <b>further</b> with Tina so they can move in with one another, though she doesn't want to rush things and especially not with David now living with Adam and Matthew following his divorce from Robyn. Pete has landed on his feet as a chauffeur, and Jenny is finding herself seeing a lot less of her husband. Matthew's relationship with Olivia is taken to the next level, to the shock of Karen and Adam.|$|E
5|$|Several armies in the Second World War in Northern European {{countries}} preferred separate winter uniforms {{rather than}} oversuits. The Waffen-SS went a <b>step</b> <b>further,</b> developing reversible uniforms with separate schemes for summer and autumn, {{as well as}} white winter oversuits. Other German units fighting in Eastern Europe were at first poorly equipped for winter, having {{to make do with}} ordinary summer uniforms, but in the winter of 1942 to 1942 new white two-piece hooded oversuits with long mitten gauntlets started to arrive. American troops in Europe in the winter of 1944 to 1945 improvised snow capes and helmet covers from white cloth such as bed linen.|$|E
5|$|The Order of the	White Shrine of Jerusalem Like {{the members}} of the Masonic Lodge and other {{appendant}} bodies, members of the White Shrine must profess a belief in a Supreme Being. However, the White Shrine goes one <b>step</b> <b>further,</b> requiring members to profess a belief in Jesus Christ as the Savior and Redeemer of the World. Membership is open to female relatives of Master Masons or members either active for three years or majority of the International Order of Rainbow for Girls or Job's Daughters International who have attained of eighteen (18) years of age.|$|E

5|$|Although {{designed}} {{by one of}} Square's development teams in Japan, Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was specifically geared for the U.S. market. At the time, console role-playing games were not a major genre in North America; Square thus attempted to broaden the genre's appeal through Final Fantasy Mystic Quest. Square had already released several Final Fantasy spinoffs in North America, including the first three titles in the SaGa series as Final Fantasy Legend, and the first Mana series game as Final Fantasy Adventure, and wished to further break into the popular American consciousness. Square's executives cited the alleged difficulty of RPGs as the reason Americans shied away from them, and eased the difficulty level by tweaking {{various aspects of the}} main series' gameplay. The American release of Final Fantasy IV was altered to make the game simpler, for example. Mystic Quest was to take this one <b>step</b> <b>further,</b> and the Japanese developers worked with the American offices to make sure the game was accessible to children.|$|E
5|$|At {{their first}} series of {{meetings}} on 14 September, the Night Defence Committee began collecting a series of suggestions for improvements, which were discussed in depth on 1 October. These were passed on to Dowding for implementation, but he found that many of their suggestions were already out of date. For instance, they suggested building new radars {{that could be used}} over land, allowing the fight to continue throughout the raid. A contract for this type of radar had already been sent out in June or July. They suggested that the filter room at RAF Bentley Priory be devolved down to the Group headquarters to improve the flow of information, but Dowding had already gone a <b>step</b> <b>further</b> and devolved night interception to the Sector level at the airfields. Dowding accepted only four of the suggestions.|$|E
5|$|During Middleton's {{tenure at}} LSU the {{presidency}} of the university changed hands from President Atkinson to President James Monroe Smith, the latter an appointee of Governor Long. Towards the end of Middleton's fourth year on campus President Smith asked him if he would stay on for an additional year and also become Dean of Men. Middlteon responded that he would accept, but it had to be cleared through the War Department. Smith's request to the War Department for both the extension and the deanship for Middleton were approved. Toward the end of the fifth year Smith went a <b>step</b> <b>further,</b> suggesting that Middleton retire from the army and become a permanent member of the LSU staff. Middleton would not even consider retirement, but accepted a sixth year with the ROTC program. As he began his sixth year on campus, on 1 Aug 1935, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel.|$|E

5|$|Flowing from Auerbach's {{emphasis}} on teamwork, what was also striking about his teams {{was that they}} never {{seemed to have a}} dominant scorer: in the 1960–61 NBA season, for instance, the Celtics had six players who scored between 15 and 21 points per game, but none made the Top 10 scoring list. In 1964, he sent out the first-ever NBA starting five consisting of an African-American quintet, namely Russell, Willie Naulls, Tom Sanders, Sam Jones, and K. C. Jones. Auerbach would go a <b>step</b> <b>further</b> in the 1966–67 NBA season, when he stepped down after winning nine titles in 11 years, and made Bill Russell player-coach. Auerbach also popularized smoking a victory cigar whenever he thought a game was already decided, a habit that became cult-like in popularity in the Boston area. Furthermore, having acquired a reputation as a fierce competitor, he often got into verbal altercations with officials, receiving more fines and getting ejected more often than any other coach in NBA history.|$|E
5|$|In 2013 García, while {{representing}} Spain's U17 side, {{was awarded}} the Golden Boot award at the 2013 UEFA Women's Under-17 Championship, ending the tournament as the top goalscorer and only player to have scored more than once. Spain were ultimately eliminated by Sweden in the semi-finals but ended the tournament in third after beating Belgium in the third place playoff. She was again part of the squad for the 2014 edition of the tournament where Spain went one <b>step</b> <b>further,</b> this time ending as runners-up to Germany. It {{was the second time}} in the same year that Spain had ended a major competition as runners-up, having lost to Japan in the final of the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup in April.|$|E
5|$|In November 1793, Shelby {{received}} a letter from another of Genêt's agents, Charles Delpeau. He confided to Shelby that he had been sent to secure supplies for an expedition against Spanish holdings, and inquired whether Shelby had been instructed to arrest individuals associated with such a scheme. Three days later Shelby responded by letter, relating Jefferson's warning against aiding the French. Despite having no evidence that Shelby was party to Genêt's scheme, both Jefferson and Knox felt compelled to warn him a second time. Jefferson provided names and descriptions of the French agents believed to be in Kentucky and encouraged their arrest. Knox went a <b>step</b> <b>further</b> by suggesting Kentucky would be reimbursed for any costs incurred resisting the French by force, should such action become necessary. General Anthony Wayne informed him that his cavalry was at the state's disposal. Arthur St. Clair, governor of the American Northwest Territory, also admonished Shelby against cooperation with Genêt.|$|E
60|$|He {{proceeded}} {{on his way}} again, but a dozen <b>steps</b> <b>further</b> came {{to another}} halt. Something lay in the snow at his feet. It was a fur glove. He picked it up, looked it over, and then, in his agitation, dropped it.|$|R
60|$|Marguerite <b>stepped</b> <b>further</b> {{into the}} room. Gradually by {{the dim light}} of an oil lamp placed upon a table in the recess she began to {{distinguish}} various objects: one or two chairs, another table, and a small but very comfortable-looking camp bedstead.|$|R
30|$|The {{envelopes}} (amplitudes) of zonal wind Δ u {{were calculated}} for periods from 5 to 40  days in 0.33 -day <b>steps.</b> <b>Further,</b> Δ u was deduced for all latitudes by averaging the envelopes of the grid points of each circle of latitude (longitudinal steps of 20 °).|$|R
5|$|The {{application}} of gold on the shields, {{in contrast to}} its absence {{on the rest of}} the ceiling, serves to link the ceiling to some extent with the frescoes around the walls. In the latter, gold leaf has been applied lavishly to many details and in some of the frescoes, notably those by Perugino, has been most expertly used not just to detail the robes but to highlight the folds by subtle graduation in the density of golden flecks. It is this technique that Michelangelo has picked up on and carried a <b>step</b> <b>further,</b> inspired also perhaps by the medallions that appear on a Roman triumphal arch in Botticelli's episode from the Life of Moses, showing the Punishment of the Rebels.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} was lavishly decorated with colourful Byzantine-style mosaics, cornices, and ceramics. With {{the exception of}} the Corinthian and Doric column capitals, which are of Roman or Byzantine origin, the rest of the decoration was created specifically for and during the church's construction. Vlasto finds a Proto-Bulgarian flavour in the church's interior and a relationship with the art of Persia or Central Asia. Thus, he believes that it is not based on Byzantine examples of that age. Of a contrary opinion is Miyatev, who points out significant similarities between the decoration of the Round Church and that of the Church of the Mother of God (now part of the Fenari Isa Mosque) from 908 in Constantinople. Mavrodinov goes a <b>step</b> <b>further</b> to claim that the architect of the Round Church was directly inspired by ancient examples, citing in particular the rich sculptural decoration.|$|E
5|$|There was broad {{agreement}} between Taft and Knox on major foreign policy goals; the U.S. would not interfere in European affairs, and would use force {{if necessary to}} enforce the Monroe Doctrine in the Americas. The defense of the Panama Canal, which was under construction throughout Taft's term (it opened in 1914), guided United States {{foreign policy in the}} Caribbean and Central America. Previous administrations had made efforts to promote American business interests overseas, but Taft went a <b>step</b> <b>further</b> and used the web of American diplomats and consuls abroad to further trade. Such ties, Taft hoped, would promote world peace. Taft pushed for arbitration treaties with Great Britain and France, but the Senate was not willing to yield its constitutional prerogative to approve treaties to arbitrators.|$|E
