40|$|In {{my thesis}} preparative and {{structural}} studies of <b>silver</b> <b>nitrides</b> are discussed. Ag 3 +xN {{is found to}} adopt a perovskite structure with partially filled A site. For the preparation of such <b>silver</b> <b>nitrides</b> an ammonolysis reaction has been used, and this method has been applied for the synthesis of other noble metal nitrides, such as Pd, Au and Hg nitrides. Attempts for the preparation of ternary <b>nitrides,</b> e. g. <b>silver</b> copper <b>nitride,</b> have also been done, which requires AgCuF 3 as a precursor. AgCuF 3 and its isostructural analogue NaCuF 3 crystallize in a distorted variant of the GdFeO 3 type structure with symmetry. They exhibit interesting magnetic properties, and become typical 1 D antiferromagnets at low temperature, correlated to cooperative Jahn-Teller effect. Cs 2 AgF 4 crystallizes in the K 2 NiF 4 -type structure, and its magnetic and optical properties have been studied. It behaves as a 2 D square-lattice Heisenberg ferromagnet, which is associated with orbital order. CsF has a strong tendency to form fluoride complexes, and includes easily molecules like H 2 O or Br 2. We have studied the possibilities of the inclusion of tetrahedral molecules, e. g. OsO 4 and P 4, into the CsF lattice. From the reaction of CsF with OsO 4 an oxyfluoride, Cs 3 OsO 4 F 3, is formed, which contains [OsO 4 F 2] octahedral units and [Cs 2 F] layers. In contrast, P 4 is not included into the CsF lattice, but transformed into black amorphous phosphorus. In {{the last part of}} my thesis, structural studies have been performed on SiBr 4 (m. p. 278 K), the only tetrahedral EX 4 compound (E = C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb; X = F, Cl, Br, I) for which no structural data has yet been reported. A full crystal-structure prediction of SiBr 4 by lattice-energy minimizations was done in collaboration with A. Wolf from University Frankfurt am Main. The structures of two polymorphs of SiBr 4, a high temperature phase (Pa- 3) and a low temperature phase (P 21 /c) have been experimentally determined from the refinements of X-ray and synchrotron powder diffraction data as well as single crystal diffraction data. The transition temperature and halogen-halogen interactions of the experimental and calculated structures are discussed.

30|$|Nanophotonic {{technologies}} {{based on}} nanowires have {{attracted much attention}} in the last decade. Owing to their interesting optical and electronic properties, nanowires (NWs) could serve as building blocks for novel miniaturized photonic and optoelectronic devices [1] with applications ranging from waveguiding [2 – 6] to lasing [7 – 11]. Recently, semiconductor NW-based nanolasers that utilize the surface plasmon polariton (SPP) effect as the optical guiding mechanism have been successfully demonstrated [8, 10]. As hybrid plasmonic structures {{play an important role}} in determining the modal behavior and lasing properties, the unavoidable metal-based nanostructure significantly increases the fabrication complexity. Cutting-edge bottom-up synthesis techniques [12, 13] enable the fabrication of various kinds of NWs with accurately controlled components, dimensions, and shapes. In this study, we analyze the guiding properties of an aligned NW pair formed by a gain NW and a metal NW, fabricated using bottom-up techniques, on a suspended dielectric substrate. We then propose a three-dimensional (3 D) plasmonic Fabry-Pérot (FP) nanocavity composed of the NW pair (composed of <b>silver</b> and gallium <b>nitride)</b> truncated by two Ag-coated end facets that act as reflectors. The proposed nanocavity, which is based on the SPP modes at visible wavelengths around 450 nm, is suspended on a thin substrate of thickness t. The air gap distance d (between the two NWs) and thickness t are varied in later calculations under different metal NW radii rm and dielectric NW radii rGaN. We are particularly interested in the case of a thin substrate (t= 5 nm) with low refractive index (ns= 1.5) corresponding to a free-standing dielectric nanomembrane consisting of, for example, silicon dioxide (SiO 2). In this way, the bottom-up approaches for organic/inorganic nanomembranes [14, 15] may be further integrated with surface plasmonics to enable more functionalities. In addition, the substrate thickness affects the characteristics of the lasing modes. The SPP modes formed from strong coupling between the metal and dielectric NWs on thick substrates often feature substrate-mediated characteristics [16], which result in strong field enhancement at the interface between the substrate and metal region. The significant loss at the metal region and the low overlap with the gain region are therefore the main challenges for lasing. In contrast, hybrid plasmonic modes on a thin substrate often exhibit characteristics of dielectric NW-guided modes and lead to better confinement and lower modal loss. Except for the analysis of modal characteristics by two-dimensional (2 D) finite-element method (FEM) [17, 18], we utilize 3 D FEM to solve for the modal volume Vm and reflection field pattern. The orthogonality theorem of waveguide modes is applied to extract the modal reflectivity R[19]. We also estimate the required cavity length L, quality factor QFP, and threshold gain gth necessary for the lasing action at the target wavelength of 450 nm.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the optomechanical properties of an optical cavity containing, as a mirror, a multilayer membrane composed of tris(8 -hydroxyquinoline) aluminium (Alq 3), <b>silver</b> and silicon <b>nitride.</b> Alq 3 is an organic semi-conductor compound which shows photoluminescence at 500 nm with absorption peaked at 405 nm. These properties, {{together with the}} relative ease with which it can be prepared in thin ﬁlms, are the reasons why it is already being used in applications such as OLEDs and photovoltaic cells. Alq 3 may also prove useful in optomechanics thanks to, for instance, cooling due to forces photo-induced by interaction between electron-hole pairs and mechanical vibrational modes. The typical experimental setup in optomechanics consists of an optical cavity {{where one of the}} end-mirrors can move as an oscillator. Forces are exerted on the oscillator by the light in a resonator-like conﬁguration. This forces may have diﬀerent origins, for example radiation pressure, due to momentum exchange in collisions between photons and the oscillator, and photothermal deformation, due to heating by light absorption. The consequent mechanical response shifts the optical resonance frequency of the resonator, altering the intensity of the intra-cavity ﬁeld and thus the forces. This way, a coupling between light ﬁeld in the resonator and mechanical motion is established. The light-induced forces respond to a displacement of the movable component with a time lag, given by the ﬁnite lifetime of photons inside the resonator for the radiation pressure and diﬀusion time of heat in the oscillator for the photothermal force. In a linearised dynamics regime, this retardation enables cooling/heating of the mechanical modes of motion as extraction/insertion of work by the light ﬁeld. Moreover, non-linear dynamical eﬀects arise when the mechanical modes are heated, of which multistability and auto-oscillations are some examples. In our experiment, the multilayer membrane is clamped but able to bend and vibrate according to vibrational modes due to its geometry and boundary conditions. An eﬀective temperature for each mode is identiﬁed with the amount of its associated thermal energy. Cooling or heating is thus experienced as a decrease or increase of this energy. We produced software simulations of our system driven by two diﬀerent wave- lengths, one inside and one outside the absorption spectrum of Alq 3. This allows to compute the absorption in each layer and to simulate how it varies due to changes in the membrane’s layered structure. We then show how cooling is induced on two vibrational modes of the membrane through photothermal forces mediated by light absorption in the Alq 3 at its absorption wavelength and Ag outside the absorption spectrum. Moreover, we made preliminary investigations on the non-linear dynamics arising by photothermal-induced heating, which yield instabilities depending on the initial conditions of laser power and detuning from resonance...|$|R

40|$|During {{the recent}} two decades, {{considerable}} {{efforts have been}} made to explore new generations of interconnecting materials and printed lines to replace the traditionally used toxic lead-based solders in electronic industries. Electrical conductive adhesive (ECA) which consists of conductive metallic particles and a polymeric matrix has attracted {{a great deal of attention}} as one of the most promising alternative materials. The conventional ECAs are typically made of silver micro flakes and epoxy resin. The low electrical conductivity of these ECAs is their main drawback compared to traditional lead-based solders, which hinders their applicability in today’s blooming electronic industries. An enormous amount of research works have been conducted to enhance the electrical conductivity of the conventional ECAs, including increasing the polymer shrinkage, surface modification of silver flakes, introduction of low melting components to the ECA formulation, and the use of nano-sized conductive materials inside the formulation of the conventional ECAs. All of these approaches affect the quality of inter filler interaction inside the electrical network, in different ways. The recent progress in nanotechnology helped material scientists to precisely design nanomaterials with different morphologies and surface chemistry. Owing to this capability, incorporation of nano-sized conductive fillers with different natures, morphologies, and surface properties inside the conventional formulation of ECAs has drawn considerable attention to overcome the common drawbacks of conventional ECAs, such as poor electrical and mechanical properties, reliability issues, and large filler content. It has been reported that the introduction of conductive nanomaterials into the conventional ECAs can improve the electrical conductivity of ECAs if their size, morphology, and the ratio between nanofiller and silver flakes is carefully taken under consideration. In this project, we developed new generations of hybrid electrical conductive adhesives (ECAs) by introducing conductive nanofillers (spherical silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs), high aspect-ratio silver nanobelts (Ag NBs), and graphene) into the conventional formulation of ECAs. To harness the characteristic properties of the nanofillers and to facilitate their homogeneous dispersion inside the epoxy, nanofillers were functionalized. In the first step of this project, spherical Ag NPs were synthesized and simultaneously functionalized with thiocarboxilic acids, resulting in the formation of NPs less than 5 nm. Two thiocarboxylic acids with the same chemical structure but different chain lengths (3 and 11 carbons) were used to functionalize the NPs. We showed that the size and the electrical properties of the NPs can be controlled by varying the chain length of their covering organic layer. The diameter of the Ag NPs functionalized with the short-chain acid was two times smaller than those with the long-chain acid. We also found that the short-chain functionalized NPs were electrically conductive while the long-chain functionalized ones were nonconductive. The short-chain functionalized NPs were incorporated into the conventional ECAs. We found that at low NPs contents (< 20 wt %) the electrical conductivity of the hybrid ECAs increased due to the filling of NPs into the interstices of the micron-sized silver flakes, bridging of the NPs among separated flakes, and sintering of the NPs at relatively low curing temperature of 150 °C. However, higher NPs contents reduced the electrical conductivity because they may cluster and increase the gaps between the silver flakes. Furthermore, at higher NPs content, the number of contact points increases, which in turn decreases the electrical conductivity of the final ECAs. The positive effect of the synthesized NPs on the electrical conductivity of the nanocomposite is basically attributed to the increased number of electrical pathways inside the electrical network due to the bridging of the NPs between separated silver flakes. However, a large amount of NPs are needed to form effective bridges inside the network, which increases the number of contact points inside the filler system and also increases the cost of the final ECAs. In the second step, we implement a novel type of high aspect-ratio silver nanostructure, silver nanobelts (Ag NBs), as co-filler inside the conventional formulation of the ECAs. The Ag NBs (10 - 40 nm thick, 100 - 400 nm wide and 1 - 10 µm long) were synthesized through self-assembly and room-temperature joining of hexagonal and triangular silver unit blocks which were synthesized by chemical reduction of <b>silver</b> <b>nitride</b> in the presence of poly(methacrylic acid). The incorporation of a small amount of the Ag NBs (2 wt%, NBs to flakes weight-ratio, K = 0. 03) into a conventional ECA with 60 wt% silver flakes resulted in an electrical conductivity enhancement of 1550 % in comparison to that of the conventional ECAs with the same total silver weight fraction, while addition of 2 wt% (K = 0. 03) NBs into the conventional ECA with 80 wt% silver flakes enhanced the electrical conductivity of the hybrid ECA approximately 240 %. These results imply high aspect-ratio NBs are more effective to improve the electrical conductivity of ECAs at concentrations close to percolation threshold. Considering the importance of the aspect-ratio of the nanofillers, in the next step, we implemented graphene, which is known for its exceptional electrical, mechanical and thermal properties, to further reduce the amount of silver flakes while maintaining a high electrical conductivity. Graphene, possessing the highest aspect-ratio among all the nanostructures and also due to its 2 D structure, can provide extremely high surface area for electron transformation inside the electrical network. However, to exploit the interesting properties of the graphene, their single layer structure must be preserved inside the polymeric matrix. To achieve this goal, we applied two types of surface modification to exfoliate and stabilize graphene layers. First, we decorated graphene surface with Ag NPs, functionalized with a short chain length thiocarboxylic acid, and introduced this 2 D nanostructure into the conventional ECAs. The electrical conductivity measurements revealed that the decorated graphene significantly improves the electrical conductivity of the conventional ECAs only at low filler concentrations, while to achieve high electrical conductivity, elevated curing temperatures are needed. This situation is a result of the increased number of contact points because of Ag NPs on graphene surface. Second, we used a non-covalent approach to stabilize graphene using the surfactant; sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Our results showed that the stabilization of graphene with SDS noticeably enhance the electrical conductivity of the ECAs, which is attributed to the role of SDS in exploiting the high aspect-ratio of graphene. In order to examine this hypothesis, we used a larger size graphene and applied the same SDS modification protocol. The electrical resistivity measurements showed that the electrical conductivity enhancement in the case of hybrid ECAs with large SDS–modified graphene was more significant than that with small SDS–modified graphene. The percolation threshold for the hybrid ECA with 1. 5 wt% of both large and small graphene was reduced to an interestingly low value of 10 wt% while this value for conventional ECAs, and hybrid ECAs with non-modified graphenes was 40 wt%. Furthermore, adding 1. 5 wt% of large SDS-modified graphene into the conventional ECA with 80 wt% silver flake content resulted in a very low electrical resistivity of 1. 6 × 10 - 5 Ω. cm which is lower than that of eutectic lead-based solders...|$|E
