25|$|There is also {{criticism}} that federal energy policies since the 1973 oil crisis have {{been dominated by}} crisis-mentality thinking, promoting expensive quick fixes and single-shot solutions that ignore market and technology realities. Instead of providing stable rules that support basic research while leaving plenty of scope for American entrepreneurship and innovation, congresses and presidents have repeatedly backed policies which promise solutions that are politically expedient, but whose prospects are doubtful, without adequate consideration of the dollar costs, environmental costs, or national <b>security</b> <b>costs</b> of their actions.|$|E
25|$|The PCB {{spent an}} {{estimated}} $3 million {{to host the}} three matches, with players on the World XI team being paid approximately $100,000 each. The ICC contributed more than $1 million towards <b>security</b> <b>costs.</b> While attendance {{for the first two}} matches were as high as 90%, this was down on the crowd numbers for the final of the 2017 Pakistan Super League. Higher ticket pricing was to blame for the drop in attendance, with some tickets being given to local schools as a result. The ICC and PCB looked at the possibility for further World XI tours to Pakistan in the next two years, with the priority for more Full Member sides to tour.|$|E

40|$|In this work, {{we present}} several {{compiler}} optimizations {{to reduce the}} overhead due to software protection. We first propose an aggressive rematerialization algorithm which attempts to maximally realize non-trusted values from other trusted values thereby avoiding the <b>security</b> <b>cost</b> for those non-trusted values. We further propose a compiler technique to utilize the secure storage in our machine model efficiently. To optimize the <b>security</b> <b>cost</b> on data {{that has to be}} stored in non-trusted storage, we propose a data grouping technique. Security operations can be performed over the group of data instead of over each piece separately. We show an interesting application of the data grouping technique to reduce the <b>security</b> <b>cost.</b> We test the effectiveness of our optimizations on a recently proposed software protection scheme that involves large overhead. Our results show that the above optimizations are effective and reduce the security overhead significantly. 1...|$|R

25|$|In 1979, {{chartered}} accountant Tom Kirstein and architect Chip Barrett organized an annual sandcastle competition, which became internationally famous. The event {{took advantage of}} the long, sandy beach exposed at low tide, giving enough time for entrants to construct elaborate displays. Prizes of up to $10,000 were awarded, and crowds of 150,000 were estimated at the competition's height. In 1987, the contest was ended because of <b>security</b> <b>costs</b> and concerns. In 2008, a group of local high school students (Sara Woodward, Jorden Abernethy, Daniel Fowler, Michael Vanderpolder, and Tasha Svenson) and members of the community (Spenser Bolen, Michael Nolan, Trixie Nolan, and Lisa Nolan) launched a Sandcastle Competition revival. This competition drew 40,000 guests and over 70 teams.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Content Distribution Network (CDN) {{architectures}} face a {{wide range}} of security threats. In this paper, we compare the cost of achieving low and high security for different CDN architectures. We reviewed the existing and emerging systems, identified the threats that they face, defined the general security requirements and considered the mechanisms available to meet the requirements. To assess the <b>security</b> <b>cost,</b> we first defined the process for selecting security mechanisms, and then defined the process for ranking the mechanisms for each architecture. The security comparison result clearly shows that the more the cost of providing service is pushed to the end points, the higher the <b>security</b> <b>cost.</b> To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first effort to assess a <b>security</b> <b>cost</b> comparison of different CDN architectures. Our work is orthogonal to other studies that try to find ways of reducing the content distribution service cost, rather than quantifying the cost to provide service security. I...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, the Israel economy {{went into a}} {{downturn}} due to the crashing of the global dot-com bubble which bankrupted many startups established {{during the height of}} the bubble. The Second Intifada, which cost Israel billions of dollars in <b>security</b> <b>costs,</b> and a decline in investment and tourism, sent unemployment in Israel to the double digits, growth in one quarter of 2000 was 10%. In 2002 the Israeli economy declined in one Quarter about 4%. [...] Afterwards Israel managed to create a remarkable recovery by opening up new markets to Israeli exporters farther afield, such as in the rapidly growing countries of East Asia. As well as a rebound in the tech sector with the gradual bottoming out of the dotcom crash and global increase in internet usage worldwide which created a demand for software, and a demand post-9/11 in Security and defense products. Both of which Israel was ready to provide due to early investment in those fields, allowed for a gradual easing of the unemployment situation within the country.|$|E
2500|$|On July 20, it was {{revealed}} that Niagara Falls, New York, was attempting to bill Wallenda an additional $25,000 for police and fireman overtime. [...] City officials cited the state law passed to allow the walk, which read [...] "Mr. Wallenda shall pay... reasonable costs associated with security or law enforcement stemming from this activity". [...] Dyster said to forgive the alleged debt would amount to [...] "a gift of public funds". [...] Wallenda called the request [...] "disgusting and sad," [...] saying [...] "This was a great thing for the area... gave me a key to the city, and now they want to ask for more money?" [...] He noted that the city staged a downtown festival {{to take advantage of the}} crowds, and said he should not have to pay the <b>security</b> <b>costs</b> related to the festival. [...] His lawyer, John P. Bartolomei, said Wallenda was only responsible for money spent by the city in the park itself, which had already been more than paid. [...] He also noted that Wallenda's contract was with the state parks commission, not the city itself. [...] Senator Maziarz called the city's position [...] "shortsighted" [...] and accused Dyster of being [...] "disingenuous". [...] He noted that Dyster had been against the walk from the beginning and that the city had never tried to bill other entertainers for costs associated with their acts. [...] On July 24, the city council passed a resolution encouraging Dyster to stop pursuing the alleged debt by a 4-1 margin. [...] Dyster responded by stating he was legally obligated to continue his efforts, remarking [...] "Since the council didn't establish the fee I'm not sure if the council can forgive it". [...] He did, however, say he would ask the state comptroller for second opinion.|$|E
2500|$|Less {{than two}} weeks before the {{proposed}} move date, NUCC requested that Woodinville once again provide the public park property for use by TC4 for a period of 60 days. If the city was unwilling, the church publicly announced a plan to relocate on church property for 90 days without further permit procedures. The city council declined to make the park available and informed the church that it would face a full legal response and code enforcement effort if it went ahead with the move. [...] Despite these warnings, NUCC allowed TC4 to relocate to church property on May 13. The city filed a motion for a Temporary Restraining Order with King County Superior Court on May 12, which was denied by Judge Palmer Robinson after reviewing the city's briefing and hearing oral argument. Instead the judge issued a temporary restraining order preventing the city from taking code enforcement action until a May 24 hearing, thus allowing TC4 to move onto church property, subject to certain conditions. [...] Woodinville filed for injunctive relief, breach of contract, and collection of damages with the King County Superior Court. [...] On May 30, Judge Charles Mertel ordered the sides to mediation to be conducted daily while the case was being heard. [...] This mediation failed to result in a settlement. The city also sought financial restitution for private and public <b>security</b> <b>costs.</b> On June 9, Judge Mertel ruled the encampment and church were in violation of their 2004 agreement with the city and ordered the encampment to vacate the site by midnight June 17. On June 13, NUCC and SHARE/WHEEL filed an appeal with the state Court of Appeals arguing that the city's land use code is an unconstitutional infringement upon the church's religious expression, that the church did not violate the 2004 agreement between the church and city, and that the church was denied its constitutional right to a trial by jury. [...] On June 16 the Washington State Court of Appeals issued a stay of the trial court's decision pending the resolution of the appeal. The City appealed the stay, but the stay was affirmed by a full panel of appellate judges. [...] The City's request for attorney fees was subsequently denied by Judge Mertel. Additionally, a Northeast District Judge in Redmond dismissed 28 misdemeanor citations from the city against a SHARE/WHEEL employee by ruling that the city was [...] "without authority" [...] to issue the citations. On February 26, 2007, Judge David Steiner ordered Woodinville to pay the $8,388 in attorneys' fees needed to defend the SHARE employee.|$|E
