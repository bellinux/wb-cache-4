However, {{back in the early}} 1900s Cambridge Springs was a flourishing resort town due to a couple geographic oddities. The primary factor was location. At first glance nothing seems remarkable about the town, but in fact it is located on the Erie Railroad line, halfway between New York and Chicago, which made it an ideal stopover location for railway patrons. The secondary factor was the local mineral springs which were visited by numerous people seeking to improve their health.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine complimented the remix stating: [...] " [...] might replace André 3000's {{typically}} great guest feature {{with one}} from J. Cole, but hey, anyone can sound good over this beat. And not only that, but Cole's vocals, however brief, are a welcome complement." [...] Making reference to its music video, Entertainment Weeklys Erin Strecker commented: [...] "I'm assuming it was shot mid-summer, {{which is when}} this really should have been put out. Releasing this track {{at the end of}} October <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> odd choice, as the video involves a grillout and trailer-park pool party that would have sparkled mid-July." [...] The remix was nominated in the category for Best Collaboration at the 2012 BET Awards. For the week ending November 5, 2011, [...] "Party" [...] debuted at number two on the South Korean International Singles Chart, selling 85,143 digital downloads. It became the seventy third best-selling single in South Korea in 2011.|$|E
500|$|Spence D. of IGN commented, [...] "Initially catchy, it's {{ultimately}} forgettable {{other than}} it's the musical counterpart/fallout to/from the duo's lip lock publicity stunt on the 2003 MTV Music Video Awards." [...] Jamie Gill of Yahoo! Music Radio stated that [...] "Madonna's {{appearance on the}} brilliantly titled but deeply dreary 'Me Against The Music' was a postmodern prank designed to make all sane listeners think 'actually, American Life was pretty good, after all.'" [...] While reviewing The Singles Collection, Mayer Nissim of Digital Spy said that [...] "the only arguable weak link is the Madonna-featuring 'Me Against The Music', but in this context what once looked like a respectful {{passing of the baton}} now <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> unconditional surrender of pop Queendom to its rightful heir." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly called [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] "the album's coy, overly busy single". Dorian Lynskey of The Guardian noted it as [...] "the only duff track" [...] of the album. Jon Pareles of Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "Madonna shows up in the album's first song, 'Me Against the Music', as if endorsing Spears's foray into come-hither posing and club-land beats." ...|$|E

500|$|Author Robert Rodriguez {{describes}} [...] "His Name Is Legs" [...] as a [...] "comedy number" [...] and [...] "a self-indulgent in-joke" [...] {{that appeared}} to show Harrison [...] "doubling down on efforts to alienate his audience", after the bad press he had received over the winter of 1974–75. On release, Dave Marsh of Rolling Stone said that the song [...] "might be Harrison's way of countering charges of humorlessness" [...] but that [...] "since neither Smith nor Harrison is very funny, it does more to confirm the charges." [...] In the NME, Neil Spencer referred {{to the image of}} Harrison with [...] "a chirpy smirk plastered across his dial" [...] as [...] "misleading", given the album's overall mood, and added: [...] "'His Names Is Legs (Ladies and Gentlemen)' is the odd track out because it's (ulp) not serious. It <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> attempt to recapture some of the innocent light-heartedness of Beatle days." [...] Ray Coleman of Melody Maker predicted that Extra Texture would [...] "re-establish [...] as a powerful artist with an ear for unusual but attractive tunes allied to some quirky lyrics", and he described the closing song as an [...] "up-tempo splash of fun, and it jumps, too".|$|E
500|$|The {{compilation}} album received universal critical acclaim. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic {{gave the}} collection five stars and {{compared it to}} Greatest Hits: My Prerogative, saying that although {{they had the same}} length, they were [...] "different listening experiences". He also noted that the more recent tracks [...] "help push The Singles away from teen pop and toward pure dance-pop bliss. [...] It does result in a stronger overall listen, since there are no slow patches here, just a parade of relentless hooks and rhythms that wound up defining the sound of a decade". Mayer Nissim of Digital Spy also gave the album five stars stating that [...] " [...] perfectly captures the career of one of the best singles artists of the last ten years. Running from '...Baby One More Time' to 'Radar', you get a single-disc timeline that shows a progression in style and substance from school uniform-wearing pop ingénue to sultry motorik saucepot. [...] The only arguable weak link is the Madonna-featuring 'Me Against the Music', but in this context what once looked like a respectful passing of the baton now <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> unconditional surrender of pop Queendom to its rightful heir." [...] The reviewer also noted the impact on popular culture and pop music of Spears, highlighting [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again", [...] "Toxic" [...] and [...] "Stronger".|$|E
500|$|Pearl Jam {{went on to}} tour Europe for {{its first}} time in six years. The band played a small secret show at the Astoria in London, and headlined the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2006, despite having vowed to never play at a festival again after Roskilde. In an {{interview}} {{in advance of the}} band's return to the festival circuit, Gossard commented, [...] "It <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> era to trust that we're aware enough to get through those bigger shows. We have a heightened awareness of what needs to happen every night so people are as safe as they can possibly be." [...] Vedder started both concerts with an emotional plea to the crowd to look after each other. He commented during the Leeds set that the band's decision to play a festival for the first time after Roskilde {{had nothing to do with}} [...] "guts" [...] but with trust in the audience. On September 19, 2006, at the Torino, Italy show at Palaisozaki, Pearl Jam played Pearl Jam in its entirety in order midway through its set. After Europe, the band headed to Australia and then finished the year with two shows in Hawaii. The official bootlegs on this tour were available only in digital form, in both MP3 and lossless FLAC formats. The band's shows at The Gorge Amphitheatre were released as part of the Live at the Gorge 05/06 box set. A DVD documenting the band's shows in Italy entitled Immagine in Cornice was released in 2007.|$|E

500|$|Fashion {{garnered}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics, who praised its direction, screenplay, cinematography, music and performances. Kriti Verma of Headlines India rated the film 4 out of 5, describing it as [...] "an outstanding film and a must watch {{for people who}} visit a theatre for something more than entertainment". Zee News gave the film a rating of 4 out of 5, called it [...] "a must watch" [...] and praised the sets, music, performances and storyline. Nikhat Kazmi rated the film 3.5 out of 5, describing it as [...] " [...] a sensitive parable on bonding and empowerment". Taran Adarsh rated the film 3.5 out of 5, praised the cinematography, screenplay, dialogue, costumes and styling, and called Fashion a [...] "hard-hitting film that enlightens you, moves you, motivates and deflates you, even shocks and surprises you and of course, entertains you". Rajeev Masand gave the film a rating of 3 out of 5, and wrote, [...] "Fashion is an easy watch because the very subject lends itself to so much interest. Like the director’s own film Page 3 it is mostly sensational and on several occasions compromises authenticity {{for the sake of}} exaggerated drama". He praised the performances of the lead cast, writing that [...] "Chopra turns in a respectable performance, one that will inevitably go down as her best. The truth is, it’s one of those by-the-book characters that she understands only too well and performs just as easily. Ditto for Kangana Ranaut who plays the eccentric superdiva with such a practiced hand, it almost <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> effortless delivery. It's...Godse who invests such sincerity into her role, that she makes the character a real flesh and blood person. Kitu Gidwani, as the agency head who mentors our protagonist, Kitu strikes all the right notes, never once slipping out of character." ...|$|E
500|$|The Guardian {{journalist}} Peter Bradshaw {{felt that}} Contagion blended well {{together as a}} film, although opined that Soderbergh was somewhat unsuccessful on channeling the fears, frights, and [...] "the massive sense of loss" [...] of [...] "ordinary people". To David Denby of The New Yorker, the [...] "brilliant" [...] film was [...] "serious, precise, frightening," [...] and [...] "emotionally enveloping". Despite applauding Soderbergh for [...] "hopscotching" [...] tidily [...] "between the intimate and international", The Atlantic Christopher Orr was disappointed with the film's detached and [...] "clinical" [...] disposition, which led him to conclude that Contagion should have gone with a more inflexible rationale, or a lesson [...] "beyond 'wash your hands often and hope you're lucky'." [...] "For all the craft that went into it, Contagion is ultimately beyond good or bad, beyond criticism. It just is," [...] professed The Atlantic writer. Described as a [...] "smart" [...] and [...] "spooky" [...] installment, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Mr. Soderbergh doesn't milk your tears as things fall apart, but a passion that can feel like cold rage is inscribed in his images {{of men and women}} isolated in the frame, in the blurred {{point of view of the}} dying and in the insistent stillness of a visual style that <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> exhortation to look." [...] In regards to the story, Salon columnist Andrew O'Hehir avouched that the [...] "crisp" [...] and succinct narrative matched up to the [...] "beautifully composed" [...] visuals of the film. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter proclaimed that Soderbergh and Burns effectively created anxiety in the [...] "shrewd" [...] and [...] "unsensationalistic" [...] film without becoming exaggerated, a sentiment echoed by Jeanette Catsolis of NPR, who insisted that the duo [...] "weave multiple characters into a narrative that's complex without being confusing, and intelligent without being baffling". Writing for The Village Voice, Karina Longworth thought that Contagion reflected the [...] "self-consciousness" [...] and [...] "experimentation" [...] of some of Soderbergh's previous efforts, such as the Ocean's trilogy and The Girlfriend Experience (2009).|$|E

It'll be interesting to see where this season lands overall. Last year, we spent months entombed in a Frozen arc that seemed to stretch on for so long, it made even the warmest of fans feel icy.

2500|$|Jasper Sharp {{also gives}} the film a {{negative}} appraisal, {{calling it the}} poorest of Hasebe's films that he discusses in his Behind the Pink Curtain: The Complete History of Japanese Sex Cinema. He dismisses the film as a [...] "preposterous red-blooded macho fantasy" [...] which {{is little more than}} a series of attacks on women, and writes, that the final scene in which the two rapists are attacked by the vigilante gang, [...] "almost <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> apology for the onscreen outrages committed in the name of entertainment". Sharp describes the film as a kind of [...] "buddy movie" [...] made for men who claim to be attracted by women, but are more comfortable with other men. According to Sharp, the film trivializes the psychological effects of violence on women to a ludicrous degree, showing the victims enjoying the attacks to the point where one actually gives her attacker money, and asks him to return. 10kbullets.com also judges this aspect of the film—in which the victims come to enjoy their assaults—to be quite disturbing. Set pieces which stand out, according to Sharp include car chases, fistfights, and the ballerina's rape, set to the music of Swan Lake, with pillow feathers flying around the nude woman as if they were snowflakes.|$|E

2500|$|At Metacritic, which assigns a rated mean out of 100 from {{mainstream}} critics, the album received {{a score of}} 77, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Andy Kellman of Allmusic rated Two Eleven {{four out of five}} stars. He felt that Norwood [...] "took something of a risk by breaking from her norm and working with numerous songwriters and producers" [...] and remarked that the strategy [...] "paid off", adding that [...] "months after scores of music fans went bananas over an opportunistic resuscitation of a deceased peer's studio scraps, Brandy, a superior vocalist ignored or disregarded by many of those same people, released one of her best albums. She should not be taken for granted." [...] Steve Jones, writing for USA Today, considered Two Eleven Norwood's [...] "most impassioned album in years. Whether she's overjoyed with a new love or ready to be shut of an old one, her heart <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> open book." [...] Mesfin Fekadu from San Francisco Chronicle stated, [...] "Not many singers have released six consistently amazing albums. Brandy has. Her newest is a collection of R songs that are personal, flavored and fantastic. The album doesn't miss a beat, as Brandy's raspy-yet-earthy tone weaves into each song's beat nicely to create outstanding tracks that will have you listening again and again." [...] People declared Two Eleven [...] "her best work since 2004's career high Afrodisiac" [...] and wrote, [...] "full of subtle, sensual pleasures, the album unfolds at a slow-to-midtempo pace and stays there for most of the time, even when incorporating hip-hop or electronica beats." [...] The magazine gave the album three and a half out of four stars.|$|E
2500|$|However, Sarah Godfrey of The Washington Post {{found its}} [...] "sexed-up, party-oriented music - catchy but hardly groundbreaking" [...] and viewed the female lyrical {{perspective}} as minimal, stating [...] "There {{is plenty of}} fun happening on Battle of the Sexes, but still, the fellas clearly run it; the ladies are hardly even given a chance". NOWs Jason Richards gave the album 1 out of 5 stars and wrote [...] "Battle <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> opportunity for the rapper to be more ignorant than ever". HipHopDX writer Kathy Iandoli gave it 2½ out of 5 stars and shared a similar sentiment, calling it [...] "an idea that lost momentum {{somewhere in the middle}} of its inception, and the result is a haphazard collection of cuts with no clear direction". Jesal Padania of RapReviews gave Battle of the Sexes a 5.5/10 rating and perceived its lyrics as [...] "instantly forgettable". The Harvard Crimsons Araba A. Appiagyei-Dankah gave it 2½ out of 5 stars and wrote [...] "When the album remembers to be a “battle” rather than an endless string of mildly memorable dance tunes and awkward sex songs, it presents a one-sided and misogynistic view of women". Despite noting that [...] "there really isn't much of a battle at all", Exclaim!s Neil Acharya commended Ludacris for his performance on the album, stating [...] "he seems content to do what he does best: make a pretty run-of-the-mill topic enjoyable with his off-kilter humour and exceptional flow". The Boston Globe writer Ken Capobianco called it [...] "a riotous, raucous set" [...] and wrote favorably of Ludacris's [...] "good-humoured" [...] lyrics. Entertainment Weeklys Simon Vozick-Levinson gave Battle of the Sexes a B- rating and expressed a mixed response towards its themes, but commended Ludacris for his rapping, stating [...] "his gymnastic flow and irrepressible personality redeem more tracks than not".|$|E
2500|$|Bella has {{received}} a generally negative reception from critics. Publishers Weekly states that, after her transformation into a vampire, [...] "it's almost impossible to identify with her" [...] in Breaking Dawn. Lilah Lohr of the Chicago Tribune compares Bella's character {{to the story of}} the Quileute wolves and describes it as [...] "less satisfying." [...] During Twilight, Kirkus Reviews stated that [...] "Bella's appeal is based on magic rather than character", but that her and Edward's [...] "portrayal of dangerous lovers hits the spot". In the review of New Moon, Kirkus Reviews said that Bella's personality was [...] "flat and obsessive". Laura Miller of salon.com said, in regards to Edward and Bella, [...] "neither of them has much personality to speak of." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Jennifer Reese, in her review of Breaking Dawn noted, in regard to Bella, [...] "You may wish she had loftier goals and a mind of her own, but these are fairy tales, and as a steadfast lover in the Disney Princess mold, Bella has a certain saccharine appeal", and that during Bella's pregnancy [...] "she is not only hard to identify with but positively horrifying, especially while guzzling human blood to nourish the infant." [...] Washington Post journalist Elizabeth Hand noted how Bella was often described as breakable and that [...] "Edward's habit of constantly pulling her onto his lap or having her ride on his back further emphasize her childlike qualities", continuing to write that [...] "the overall effect is a weird infantilization that has repellent overtones to an adult reader and hardly <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> admirable model to foist upon our daughters (or sons)." [...] Gina Dalfonzo, in an article posted on the National Review website, calls Bella [...] "self-deprecating" [...] before her transformation into a vampire, and afterwards she is [...] "insufferably vain". Dalfonzo also states that Bella gets what she wants and discovers her worth [...] "by giving up her identity and throwing away nearly everything in life that matters." [...] Bella Swan was often compared to Katniss Everdeen on the publication of The Hunger Games.|$|E
