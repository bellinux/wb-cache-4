As the traditional irrigation systems, viz. canal irrigation and tubewell irrigation are not feasible due to topographical, geological and hydrological constraints, rainwater harvesting {{has been found to}} have potential of being an irrigation water resource which can provide full irrigation in conjunction with rainfall to a transplanted rice based two crop rotation. Utilization of stored water in both monsoon and post-monsoon season crops increases the efficiency of the system which is evident from higher water yield-storage capacity ratio of 1. 75. The evaluation of a rain water harvesting system has shown that integrated farming approach of utilizing the system enhances the economics of the system.

This research is to help irrigation districts of the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas to identify and prioritize the high loss deteriorated lined canals for rehabilitation and management. The ponding test method was used to estimate the loss rates on 32 canal sections. The condition rating scores were evaluated for 26 of these canals. Test calculation revisions and testing errors were first evaluated to understand the potential impacts to the <b>seepage</b> <b>loss</b> rates and condition rating system.
