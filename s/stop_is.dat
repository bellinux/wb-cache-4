5|$|The {{depth of}} the first <b>stop</b> <b>is</b> found from the tissue {{compartment}} with the highest partial pressure, {{and the depth of}} first decompression <b>stop</b> <b>is</b> the standard stop depth where this partial pressure is nearest without exceeding the critical pressure ratio.|$|E
50|$|The ejective and {{aspirated}} <b>stops</b> <b>are</b> articulated forcefully. The unaspirated voiceless <b>stops</b> <b>are</b> tense, {{while the}} voiced <b>stops</b> <b>are</b> lax.|$|R
50|$|In some languages, such as English, {{aspiration}} <b>is</b> allophonic. <b>Stops</b> <b>are</b> distinguished {{primarily by}} voicing, and voiceless <b>stops</b> <b>are</b> sometimes aspirated, while voiced <b>stops</b> <b>are</b> usually unaspirated.|$|R
50|$|Because nasal <b>stops</b> <b>are</b> always {{followed}} by nasal vowels, but prenasalized <b>stops</b> <b>are</b> always {{followed by}} oral vowels, {{it might be}} argued that nasal and prenasalized <b>stops</b> <b>are</b> allophonic, which would reduce the Paicî consonant inventory to 13.|$|R

5|$|A {{decompression}} <b>stop</b> <b>is</b> {{a period}} a diver must spend {{at a relatively}} shallow constant depth during ascent after a dive to safely eliminate absorbed inert gases from the body tissues to avoid decompression sickness. The practice of making decompression stops is called staged decompression, as opposed to continuous decompression.|$|E
5|$|A precautionary {{decompression}} stop (safety stop) of 3 {{minutes at}} 15fsw is recommended after all dives, {{but the time}} spent at the safety <b>stop</b> <b>is</b> {{not included in the}} time used to calculate repetitive group.|$|E

5000|$|In dialects of {{northern}} Japan, standard voiced <b>stops</b> <b>are</b> prenasalized, and voiceless <b>stops</b> <b>are</b> voiced. For example, [...] "strawberry" [...] is [...] {{in most of}} the south, but [...] in much of the north. Prenasalized <b>stops</b> <b>are</b> also reconstructed for Old Japanese.|$|R

5|$|Located at the Hatfield Government Center {{station is}} {{a parking garage}} for {{park-and-ride}} passengers. The garage includes 250 parking spaces accessible 24-hours a day. The <b>stop</b> <b>is</b> compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act, contains bike racks and bike lockers, and has an electronic reader board listing up-to-date arrivals of trains.|$|E
5|$|The {{controlling}} compartment for {{the first}} <b>stop</b> <b>is</b> usually the fastest tissue, but this generally changes during the ascent, and slower tissues usually control the shallower stop times. The longer the bottom time and closer to saturation of the slower tissues, the slower the tissue controlling the final stops will be.|$|E
5|$|The time at each <b>stop</b> <b>is</b> {{the time}} {{required}} to reduce partial pressure in all compartments to a level safe for the next stop, 10ft shallower.|$|E

50|$|Warren Street was {{an express}} {{station on the}} {{demolished}} IRT Ninth Avenue Line. It had three tracks, one island platform and two side platforms. It was served by trains from the IRT Ninth Avenue Line. It opened on February 14, 1870 and closed on June 11, 1940. The next southbound local <b>stop</b> <b>was</b> Barclay Street The next southbound express <b>stop</b> <b>was</b> Cortlandt Street. The next northbound local <b>stop</b> <b>was</b> Franklin Street.

5|$|The {{depth and}} {{duration}} of each <b>stop</b> <b>is</b> calculated to reduce the inert gas excess in the most critical tissues to a concentration which will allow further ascent without unacceptable risk. Consequently, {{if there is not}} much dissolved gas, the stops will be shorter and shallower than if there is a high concentration. The length of the stops is also strongly influenced by which tissue compartments are assessed as highly saturated. High concentrations in slow tissues will indicate longer stops than similar concentrations in fast tissues.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>stop</b> <b>is</b> District 11, {{the home}} of Katniss' {{deceased}} friend and Hunger Games ally, Rue. During the ceremony, Katniss delivers an impromptu, heartfelt speech expressing her feelings toward Rue and also Thresh, who spared her life. When she finishes, an old man whistles the tune that Rue used in the arena to tell Katniss that she was safe. Everyone else salutes Katniss, using the same gesture {{that she used to}} say farewell to Rue. To Katniss's horror, the old man is quickly executed before her eyes.|$|E
5|$|The tram <b>stop</b> <b>is</b> {{served by}} Line 17 of the Oslo Tramway. It has a ten-minute headway during the day, {{with half the}} {{frequency}} during evenings and in the weekends. Travel time to Jernbanetorget in the city center is nine minutes, while it is five minutes northwards to Grefsen Station. The service is provided using SL95 trams operated by Oslo Sporvognsdrift on contract with Ruter. Carl Berners plass is one of eight transfer points between the tramway and the metro.|$|E
50|$|Cornelius' {{property}} {{adjacent to}} the truck <b>stop</b> <b>was</b> the site of several Willie Nelson Fourth of July concerts in the early 1980s.

5|$|Their next <b>stop</b> <b>is</b> Agate Village, a forested {{village in}} the mountains. As Rui {{introduces}} Wes to her grandfather Eagun, another villager runs into the room, telling them that the Relic Stone—a shrine protected by Celebi—is under attack. Wes, following Eagun {{to the center of}} the tree, fights off four Cipher agents before the Relic Stone is safe. After resting, Wes is given access to the Relic Stone, the only place where he can purify Shadow Pokémon. After receiving an e-mail from Duking about Mt. battle being under attack by Cipher, Rui asks Eagun where it is and the two headed over there.|$|E
5|$|World of Dance Tour (WOD) {{was founded}} in 2008 by Myron Marten and David Gonzales in Pomona, California. It differs from other {{competitions}} {{because there is no}} final championship. WOD travels to different cities in the United States, Canada, and Europe and holds a competition in each location; therefore, WOD distinguishes itself as a tour. Each tour <b>stop</b> <b>is</b> a stand-alone competition; they are all related to each other in name only. In 2013, WOD will travel to New York City, Vallejo, Seattle, Vancouver, Berlin, Dallas, Toronto, San Diego, Montreal, Eindhoven, Boston, Orlando, Houston, Chicago, Seattle, Honolulu, Los Angeles, Union City, and Antwerp.|$|E
5|$|In December 2009, it was {{announced}} that following the success of Bustracker, an application had been developed for the iPhone that is similar to the way Bustracker works. It allows people to download an application to their iPhone that enables them to see where their nearest bus <b>stop</b> <b>is</b> and when the bus is due. Although not developed by Lothian Buses or The City of Edinburgh Council, the application has now won the backing of both companies. My Bus Edinburgh is an application developed for the Android platform which is similar in functionality to the iPhone application. Like the iPhone application, this application is developed by an independent developer, backed by Lothian Buses and The City of Edinburgh Council, and is available free of charge.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} where the diver is {{successfully}} recompressed within the nominal interval, he will be decompressed according to the schedule in the air decompression tables for surface decompression, preferably on oxygen, which is used from 50fsw (15msw), a partial pressure of 2.5 bar. The duration of the 50fsw <b>stop</b> <b>is</b> 15 minutes for the Revision 6 tables. The chamber is then decompressed to 40fsw (12msw) for {{the next stage of}} up to 4 periods on oxygen. A stop may also be done at 30fsw (9msw), for further periods on oxygen according to the schedule. Air breaks of 5 minutes are taken {{at the end of each}} 30 minutes of oxygen breathing.|$|E
25|$|The word <b>stop</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} confusing {{due to its}} multiple meanings. A stop can be {{a physical}} object: an opaque part of an optical system that blocks certain rays. The aperture <b>stop</b> <b>is</b> the aperture setting that limits {{the brightness of the}} image by restricting the input pupil size, while a field <b>stop</b> <b>is</b> a stop intended to cut out light that would be outside the desired field of view and might cause flare or other problems if not stopped.|$|E
25|$|No bus {{services}} {{pass through}} the village.

5000|$|Channel <b>stops</b> <b>are</b> {{thermally}} grown oxides {{that serve}} {{to isolate the}} charge packets in one column from those in another. These channel <b>stops</b> <b>are</b> produced before the polysilicon gates are, as the LOCOS process utilizes a high-temperature step that would destroy the gate material.
