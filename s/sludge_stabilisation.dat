Samples were taken in the sludge residues along the entire profiles, in order to compare {{the effectiveness of the}} <b>sludge</b> <b>stabilisation</b> process in the three systems. Particular attention was given to the stabilisation process occurring within the reed beds; in fact, parameters correlated to biochemical properties of organic sludge matter have been determined. Statistical procedures were used to evaluate how the biochemical processes influence the quality of sludge organic matter in the three systems. The level of total organic carbon and total nitrogen had a similar trend along the profile: their concentration decreased with increasing depth, reaching very low levels at the deepest layers. The same trend was also observed for the water soluble carbon, N-NH 3, b-glucosidase and urease activities, hydrolytic enzymes linked to C and N cycles, respectively: their values decreased dramatically with increasing depth, meaning that the level of mineralisation of the organic matter was higher in the deepest layers. The determination of extracellular enzymes bound to humic substances and humic carbon permitted to evaluate the stabilisation of organic sludge matter, and also allowed to individuate in which ways the sludge was stabilised, in terms of mineralisation and humification of the organic matter...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{critically}} {{reviews the}} fate of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) in biosolids, with emphasis on identifying operation conditions that impact the accumulation of TrOCs in sludge during conventional wastewater and sludge treatment and assessing the technologies available for TrOC removal from biosolids.

Anaerobic digestion may exacerbate the estrogenicity of sludge due to bioconversion to more potent metabolites. Application of advanced oxidation or thermal pre-treatment may minimise TrOCs in biosolids by increasing the bioavailability of TrOCs, converting TrOCs into more biodegradable products, or inducing complete mineralisation of TrOCs.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of municipal sewage <b>sludge</b> for the <b>stabilisation</b> of Pb, Zn and Cd in a heavily contaminated soil was evaluated by performing pot experiments on soil-sludge mixtures. The soil sample originated from the Montevecchio mining district, Sardinia, Italy, and presented high Pb, Zn and Cd content, {{as well as}} US EPA TCLP solubility values for Pb and Cd, which exceeded the respective regulatory limits. Sewage sludge application increased the soil pH. Stabilisation experiments showed that 10 % w/w sewage sludge addition effectively reduced Pb and Cd solubilities below the TCLP regulatory limits. At the same addition rate, the EDTA extractable fraction of Pb, Zn, Cd in the treated soil was reduced by 12, 47 and 50 % respectively compared with the untreated sample. The five-stage sequential extraction procedure applied on the untreated and treated soil samples, showed a remarkable shift of the metals towards more stable forms.

In this study, biosolids from full-scale treatment wetlands were characterised in order to evaluate {{the quality of the}} final product for land application, even without further post-treatment such as composting. Samples of influent and treated sludge were analysed for pH, Electrical Conductivity, Total Solids (TS), Volatile Solids (VS), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Dynamic Respiration Index (DRI), nutrients (Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN), Total Phosphorus (TP) and Potasium (K)), heavy metals and faecal bacteria indicators (E. coli and Salmonella spp.). According to the results, sludge water content and therefore sludge volume are reduced by 25 %. Organic matter biodegradation leads to VS around 43 - 44 %TS and COD around 500 g•kgTS- 1. The values of DRI 24 h (1000 - 1500 mgO 2 ∙kgTS- 1 ∙h- 1) indicate that treated sludge is almost stabilised final product. Besides, the concentration of nutrients is quite low (TKN~ 4 %TS, TP~ 0. 3 %TS and K~ 0. 2 - 0. 6 %TS). Both heavy metals and faecal bacteria indicators meet current legal limits for land application of the sludge.

40|$|Most biosolids {{produced}} at {{wastewater treatment plants}} in New Zealand, are currently put into landfills, were they can generate methane and produce leachate. Recent Government policy means that this disposal method cannot continue to be used and biosolids must be used beneficially. However, biosolids need to be stabilised before beneficial use. Using earthworms to break down organic wastes has gained momentum in the past decade. Earthworms and microorganisms {{can be used in}} the vermicomposting process to stabilise many organic materials including biosolids. This dissertation swnmarises information on vermicomposting obtained from a literature review and from visiting two large-scale commercial vermicomposting operations in Australia. Investigations assessed the potential of vermicomposting biosolids in New Zealand. Initially, the physical, chemical, and microbiological properties of three biosolids and four sewage sludges were measured. Worm acceptance of these materials were then determined. The four most promising materials from North Shore, Hamilton, Te Awamutu and Taupo were vermicomposted for 30 days using Eisenia fetida. The vermicasts produced were then evaluated in a glasshouse pot trial using ryegrass. The biosolids characterised had widely different properties compared to sewage <b>sludges</b> from waste <b>stabilisation</b> basins. Biosolids had more plant nutrients, greater pathogens numbers (as indicated by E. coli) and lower heavy metal concentrations than sewage sludges. Biosolids were initially toxic to worms due to ammoniwn concentrations and required stabilisation for 14 days before acceptance whereas sewage sludges were acceptable within two days if cellulose (as paper or cardboard) had been added. Vermicomposting these materials for 30 days produced vermicasts with lower volatile solids, higher C/N ratio, and significantly reduced indicator pathogen concentrations than the starting material. Ryegrass trials showed that mixing vermicasts with soil significantly increased plant growth, mostly because of the soluble N content. Trial results have shown that vermicomposting is an acceptable method for stabilising biosolids and produces a quality end product highly beneficial for land use...|$|R

In a {{time when}} the world is {{becoming}} more environmentally conscious, and is looking for simple, efficient, economical, and environmentally friendly solutions to sewage and sludge treatment, the dual digestion system presents itself as an attractive alternative to other sludge treatment systems. The dual digestion system comprises an autoheated thermophilic (55 - 65 °C) aerobic first stage and a mesophilic (37 °C) anaerobic second stage. Past research into the dual digestion system has given rise, inter alia, to the following claims (de Villiers, et al, 1991) : a) <b>sludge</b> disinfection and <b>stabilisation</b> occur in one process - disinfection. in the thermophilic aerobic first stage and stabilisation in the anaerobic second stage. b) the stability of the anaerobic stage is considerably 'improved by the increase in H 2 C 03 * alkalinity and pH in the aerobic stage. c) in the aerobic stage the sludge is aerobically or thermally pretreated (conditioned) making it more readily digestible under anaerobic conditions, thereby allowing significantly reduced retention times from 25 to 30 days for normal digestion, to 8 to 10 days. Messenger (1991), in a full scale investigation at the Potsdam Wastewater Treatment Plant in Milnerton, Cape Town, verified claims (a) and (b), but was unable to verify claim (c) above. It was the intention in this investigation to verify this claim at full scale using the existing dual digestion plant at Milnerton. However, after 9 months of starting up the plant, the fiberglass aerobic tank failed structurally along one of its seams.

40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} (AD) is {{the most}} widely used treatment process for sewage <b>sludge</b> <b>stabilisation</b> over concerns of public health. In addition, the production of methane (CH 4), a renewable fuel, has also shaped the prospective of AD within the context of energy security and global warming. This dissertation thus aimed to evaluate two main aspects of the AD process of sewage sludge. First, the potential of enhancing biogas production was assessed when co-digesting sewage sludge with glycerol. Glycerol is a by-product of biodiesel production and then rich in organic carbon. Second, the capacity of removing trace organic compounds (TrOCs) was examined. Results reported here suggest the stability of anaerobic conversion determined the ultimate CH 4 yield, greatly affecting the assessment of CH 4 potential. Alkalinity buffer and inoculum over substrate (I/S) ratio were demonstrated to be important factors in maintaining steady state of the AD process. The addition of NaHCO 3 resulted in an increase of CH 4 production of sewage sludge that could be ascribed to well-buffered conditions for methanogens. A significant enhancement in CH 4 yield from sewage sludge was achieved with an increase of I/S ratio from 1 / 9 to 1 / 1. Adequate quantity of inoculum for degrading substrate was responsible for such improvement. Moreover, no disruption of CH 4 production was found since only 0. 25...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the efficiency of a reed bed pilot system planted with macrophytes (Phragmites australis) in the stabilisation and dewatering of sludge. The water content of sludge was positively correlated with the biochemical activity (i. e. dehydrogenase activity (DH-ase) and respiration rate) under a wide range of redox conditions (aerobic-anaerobic). Mineralization processes seemed to be uninfluenced by seasonal changing. The metabolic index given by the ratio DH-ase/WSC increased with time from 0. 007 to 0. 02, implying that sludge organic matter mineralization was approaching maximum efficiency. Aerobic mineralization processes were quickly activated, as shown by the production of ammonia at 3 days and nitrate at 15 days. Nitrates conditioned the redox potential of sludge to relatively high values: from + 50 to + 150 mV in summer and + 10 to + 100 mV in winter. The positive redox potentials supported the organic carbon respiration because nitrates function as electron acceptors in the absence or scarcity of free atmospheric oxygen in the deeper layers. All these factors allow the system to (i) operate longer, with high loads applications of sludge and in any climate conditions, thereby making feasible onsite <b>sludge</b> <b>stabilisation</b> and thickening, and (ii) avoid frequent sludge transportation outside the wastewater treatment plant.

40|$|The {{usage of}} sewage sludge as an organic {{fertiliser}} offers a way to recycle nutrients and organic matter for a sustainable agriculture. Sewage sludge is rich in plant nutrient like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and micronutrients. Concerning the depletion of phosphorus resources, the reuse {{of sewage sludge}} can contribute in reducing the production of artificial fertiliser and satisfy agricultural nitrogen and phosphorus demands. Heavy metals and organic contaminants contained in sewage sludge hampered the image of sewage sludge application in agriculture, although reduced since the last decades. Another concern is pathogens in the sludge, posing a risk on {{human health and the}} food chain when applied to land. Pathogens in sewage sludge have not been considered as limiting for the use as heavy metals, thus regulations on pathogens putting less restrictions. This has changed over the last years, especially in the EU member states, lowering pathogen limits for sewage sludge (biosolids) when applied to land. Therefore, proper sanitisation of sewage sludge is required and the need for cost‐effective, simple and quick treatment methods for <b>sludge</b> <b>stabilisation</b> increased. In this study, an optimum ammonia treatment for sanitising sewage sludge was attempted. Pathogen inactivation was monitored by using indicator and model organisms. The small‐scale experiment comprised two phases, an aerobic composting phase (< 40 °C) and a subsequent anaerobic chemical treatment phase using urea solely or combined with carbonate or ECOX (sodium percarbonate). Urea addition releases ammonia, which has shown to effectively reduce pathogens. This antimicrobial effect is combined with the biological heat development in compost, also reducing pathogens.

Proteins hydrolysis was limited to a maximum value of 39 % at 30 days and 35 degreesC due to proteins availability in the form of biomass. The biodegradability of primary sludge was around 60 %, and showed no temperature dependency. The hydrolysis of the main biopolymers and overall particulate COD of the primary sludge digested in CSTRs were well described by first-order kinetics, in case hydrolysis was the rate-limiting step. Similarly, the hydrolysis of the overall particulate COD of the primary sludge digested in batch reactors were described by first-order kinetics and revealed strong temperature dependency, which follows Arrhenius equation.

The comparison uses the results from March to May 1996 in which only secondary sludge was processed. During this time the organic dry matter (ODM) was degraded by 61 % in a passage time of 18 days. The gas yield reached a level of 524 l gas per kg influence ODM. In the period from March to Mai 1996 the total loading was only 49 % of the design data value. This was influenced by the unfinished expansion work on the Mittleres Glemstal plant and the missing sewage from the later decommissioned Ramtel sewage plant. As a result the gas production was only 42 % of the design data value. The period from Mai to August 1997 was used for the second comparison with the design data. In this period - after completation of the primary clarifier and re-routing of the sewage from the Ramtel sewage plant - a mixture consisting of 30 % primary and 70 % secondary sludge was fed into the sludge digester. Although exploiting only 62 % of the loading capacity (with regard to ODM Loading) the digester-gas production reached 1414 Nm" 3 per day, 71 % of the design data value. Gas yields (in the middle of the four month period) reached 693 l gas per kg ODM influent, with a passage time of 10. 6 days. The dry matter content of the digester influent sludge was only 3. 4 % however 54 % ODM breakdown was achieved. The planned value 4. 8 % dry matter content.

40|$|During {{the last}} years, the {{implementation}} of new Wastewater Treatment Plants has lead to a significant increase of sludge production. As a response, sludge valorisation in agriculture is the preferred option nowadays, ensuring the return of organic constituents, nutrients and microelements to crop fields. In practice, sludge treatments should provide a final product suitable for land application, with reasonable investment as well as operational and maintenance costs. In this sense, sludge treatment wetlands (STW) appear as a suitable technology for sludge management from an economic and environmental point of view. The main objective of this research work {{was to assess the}} suitability of STW for sludge management; with special focus on small communities of the Mediterranean Region. To this end, technical, environmental and economic aspects of the treatment were studied in 3 full-scale systems and in a pilot plant located in Catalonia. A comparison with conventional treatments for sludge management is presented in order to establish the most favourable solution for the Catalan context. As the final result from this work, design and operation criteria are proposed as a guide for STW implementation in small Mediterranean communities. The study of the performance of the full-scale STW suggests good treatment efficiency. Moisture content was reduced by 16 - 30 %, reaching efficiencies similar to those of conventional dewatering technologies. On the other hand, VS were reduced up to 30 - 49 %VS/TS, suggesting the progressive <b>sludge</b> <b>stabilisation</b> and mineralisation. Similar values were found {{at the end of the}} treatment in the pilot plant. In this case the sludge volume was reduced around 80 % and TS increased up to 16 - 24 %. However, the observed VS reduction (up to 50 %VS/TS) after 2 months without feeding, indicates that longer resting periods should be applied in order to increase mineralisation of the sludge. A finite element model able to simulate sludge dewatering in STW was developed by combining the evapotranspiration (ET) and the Terzaghi¿s consolidation theory representing water percolation. The model allows for the determination of the most appropriate feeding frequency as a function of the sludge height stored on the wetland. Similarly, the sludge loading rate is determined as a function of ET, feeding frequency and sludge height. On the whole, the model implemented is a useful tool for the establishment of standardised criteria of STW operation. The characterisation of the final product from the pilot plant and from three full-scale systems demonstrated the suitability of biosolids as organic fertilisers. DRI values indicated the partial stabilisation of the product. Moreover, the absence of phytotoxicity and the heavy metals concentrations below the legal thresholds confirmed their viability to be reused in agriculture. However, in the pilot plant, pathogens were still present after 2 resting months, confirming the necessity of a longer resting period. Monitoring the stabilisation degree as phytotoxicity, heavy metals and pathogens' concentration during the final resting period would help optimising its duration. Looking at the environmental aspects, the static chamber method was successfully adapted to the determination of gas emissions from STW. Aerobic conditions before sludge feeding, characterised by low methane emissions and high nitrous oxide emissions, were strongly altered by fresh sludge feeding, which increases CH 4 emissions and reduces N 2 O emissions. According to the measured emissions, the Global warming potential of STW corresponds to 17 kgCO 2 eq/PE¿y, which is from 2 to 9 times lower than that of sludge centrifugation and transport. Besides,the economic and environmental assessment indicates STW with direct land application as the most cost-effective technique, which is also characterised by the lowest environmental impact. Thus STW are the best solution to manage waste sludge in decentralised small communities...|$|E
