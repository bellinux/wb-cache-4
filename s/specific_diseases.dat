5|$|Acquired {{immunodeficiency}} syndrome (AIDS) {{is defined}} in terms of either a CD4+ T cell count below 200 cells per µL or the occurrence of <b>specific</b> <b>diseases</b> in association with an HIV infection. In the absence of specific treatment, around half of people infected with HIV develop AIDS within ten years. The most common initial conditions that alert to the presence of AIDS are pneumocystis pneumonia (40%), cachexia in the form of HIV wasting syndrome (20%), and esophageal candidiasis. Other common signs include recurring respiratory tract infections.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{diversity}} of a harvested plant {{can be the}} result of genetic differences: a crop may have genes conferring early maturity or disease resistance Such traits collectively determine a crop's overall characteristics and their future potential. Diversity within a crop includes genetically-influenced attributes such as seed size, branching pattern, height, flower color, fruiting time, and flavor. Crops can also vary in less obvious characteristics such as their response to heat, cold, a drought, or their ability to resist <b>specific</b> <b>diseases</b> and pests.|$|E
5|$|The {{proteasome}} and its subunits are {{of clinical}} significance {{for at least}} two reasons: (1) a compromised complex assembly or a dysfunctional proteasome can be associated with the underlying pathophysiology of <b>specific</b> <b>diseases,</b> and (2) they can be exploited as drug targets for therapeutic interventions. More recently, more effort has been made to consider the proteasome for the development of novel diagnostic markers and strategies. An improved and comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology of the proteasome should lead to clinical applications in the future.|$|E

5|$|A gene is a {{sequence}} of DNA or RNA which codes for a molecule that has a function. The DNA is first copied into RNA. The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function. The transmission of genes to an organism's offspring {{is the basis of}} the inheritance of phenotypic traits. These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes. Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be. Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as gene–environment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye color or number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, risk for <b>specific</b> <b>diseases,</b> or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life.|$|E
5|$|Testing often {{including}} {{observing the}} colour of the fluid, measuring CSF pressure, and counting and identifying {{white and red}} blood cells within the fluid; measuring protein and glucose levels; and culturing the fluid. The presence of red blood cells and xanthochromia may indicate subarachnoid hemorrhage; whereas central nervous system infections such as meningitis, may be indicated by elevated white blood cell levels. A CSF culture may yield the microorganism that has caused the infection, or PCR {{may be used to}} identify a viral cause. Investigations to the total type and nature of proteins reveal point to <b>specific</b> <b>diseases,</b> including multiple sclerosis, paraneoplastic syndromes, systemic lupus erythematosus, neurosarcoidosis, cerebral angiitis; and specific antibodies such as Aquaporin 4 may be tested for to assist in the diagnosis of autoimmune conditions. A lumbar puncture that drains CSF may also be used as part of treatment for some conditions, including idiopathic intracranial hypertension and normal pressure hydrocephalus.|$|E

40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are {{functional}} RNA molecules which play {{important roles}} in the post-transcriptional regulation. miRNAs regulate their target genes by repressing translation or inducing degradation of the target genes' mRNAs. Many databases have been constructed to provide computationally predicted miRNA targets. However, they cannot provide the miRNA targets expressed in a specific tissue and related to a <b>specific</b> <b>disease</b> at the same time. Moreover, they cannot provide the common targets of multiple miRNAs and the common miRNAs of multiple genes at the same time. To solve these two problems, we construct a database called CSmiRTar (Condition-Specific miRNA Targets). CSmiRTar collects computationally predicted targets of 2588 human miRNAs and 1945 mouse miRNAs from four most widely used miRNA target prediction databases (miRDB, TargetScan, microRNA. org and DIANA-microT) and implements functional filters which allows users to search (i) a miRNA's targets expressed in a specific tissue or/and related to a <b>specific</b> <b>disease,</b> (ii) multiple miRNAs' common targets expressed in a specific tissue or/and related to a <b>specific</b> <b>disease,</b> (iii) a gene's miRNAs related to a <b>specific</b> <b>disease,</b> and (iv) multiple genes' common miRNAs related to a <b>specific</b> <b>disease.</b> We believe that CSmiRTar will be a useful database for biologists to study the molecular mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation in human or mouse.

25|$|In {{the second}} half of the 1800s Louis Pasteur perfected {{experiments}} which disproved the then-popular theory of spontaneous generation and from which he derived the modern theory of (infectious) disease. Using experiments based on this theory, which posited that specific microorganisms cause <b>specific</b> <b>diseases,</b> Pasteur isolated the infectious agent from anthrax. He then derived a vaccine by altering the infectious agent so as to make it harmless and then introducing this inactivated form of the infectious agents into farm animals, which then proved to be immune to the disease.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{advances}} in personalized medicine rely on technology that confirms a patient's fundamental biology, DNA, RNA, or protein, which ultimately leads to confirming disease. For example, personalised {{techniques such as}} genome sequencing can reveal mutations in DNA that influence diseases ranging from cystic fibrosis to cancer. Another method, called RNA-seq, can show which RNA molecules are involved with <b>specific</b> <b>diseases.</b> Unlike DNA, levels of RNA can change {{in response to the}} environment. Therefore, sequencing RNA can provide a broader understanding of a person’s state of health. Recent studies have linked genetic differences between individuals to RNA expression, translation, and protein levels.|$|E

25|$|Genetic testing {{identifies}} {{changes in}} chromosomes, genes, or proteins. The variety of genetic tests has expanded throughout the years. In the past, the main genetic tests searched for abnormal chromosome numbers and mutations {{that lead to}} rare, inherited disorders. Today, tests involve analyzing multiple genes to determine {{the risk of developing}} <b>specific</b> <b>diseases</b> or disorders, with the more common diseases consisting of heart disease and cancer. The results of a genetic test can confirm or rule out a suspected genetic condition or help determine a person's chance of developing or passing on a genetic disorder. Several hundred genetic tests are currently in use, and more are being developed.|$|E
25|$|Plato {{considered}} gymnastics to be {{an important}} part of education (see Republic iii. and parts of Laws) and according to him it was the sophist Prodicus who first pointed out the connection between gymnastics and health. Having found gymnastic exercises beneficial to his own weak constitution, Prodicus formulated a method that became generally accepted and was subsequently improved by Hippocrates. Galen also put great stress on the proper and frequent use of gymnastics. Throughout other ancient Greek medical writings special exercises are prescribed as cures for <b>specific</b> <b>diseases,</b> showing {{the extent to which the}} Greeks considered health and fitness connected. The same connection is commonly suggested by experts today.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} Mayas {{believe in}} the existence, within each individual, of various souls, usually described in quasi-material terms (such as 'shadow', 'breath', 'blood', and 'bone'). The loss {{of one or more}} souls results in <b>specific</b> <b>diseases</b> (generically called 'soul-loss', 'fright', or susto). In Classic Maya texts, certain glyphs are read as references to the soul. Much more is known about the so-called 'co-essences', that is, animals or other natural phenomena (comets, lightning) linked with the individual (usually a male) and protecting him. In some cases (often connected to black sorcery), one can change into co-essences acting like a sort of 'werewolves' (see also nagual). The Classic Maya grandees had a whole array of such soul companions, which were called wayob, and carried distinct hieroglyphic names. Among them were spook-like creatures, but also violent stars.|$|E
