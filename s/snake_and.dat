5|$|Both {{in water}} and on land, the newts are largely nocturnal. In their aquatic habitats, they hide under vegetation, and on land, they use {{structures}} such as logs, rocks, or small animal burrows for cover.

5|$|Studies on Drosophila serpins {{reveal that}} Serpin-27A {{inhibits}} the Easter protease (the final protease in the Nudel, Gastrulation Defective, <b>Snake</b> <b>and</b> Easter proteolytic cascade) and thus controls dorsoventral patterning. Easter functions to cleave Spätzle (a chemokine-type ligand), {{which results in}} toll-mediated signaling. As well as its central role in embryonic patterning, toll signaling is also important for the innate immune response in insects. Accordingly, serpin-27A also functions to control the insect immune response. In Tenebrio molitor (a large beetle), a protein (SPN93) comprising two discrete tandem serpin domains functions to regulate the toll proteolytic cascade.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{is motivated by}} the possibility of implementing <b>Snakes</b> <b>and</b> Ladders game in elementary school students as English writing ability enhancement. <b>Snakes</b> <b>and</b> Ladders game (in Bahasa, it is called Ular Tangga) is commonly used as a media for enhancing writing ability. <b>Snakes</b> <b>and</b> Ladders game has an advantage in enhancing writing ability. On the other hand, English writing ability enhancement in elementary school, especially for third grade students is not yet optimized. Thus, <b>Snakes</b> <b>and</b> Ladders game could be a solution. Empirical evidence was generated through Pre-eksperiment research that was held in state elementary school Sukaharja 1 (SD Negeri 1 Sukaharja). Problem formulation of this {{research is}} how the implementation of <b>Snakes</b> <b>and</b> Ladders game enhances English writing ability of state elementary school Sukaharja 1 third grade students. The motivation of this research is to find out the picture about the improvement of English writing ability in state elementary school Sukaharja 1 third grade students. This research uses quantitative method, meanwhile data collection technique in this research comprises test assessment. The data of this research is 24 third grade students of state elementary school Sukaharja 1, Subdistrict: Rajadesa, District: Ciamis. The hypothesis assessment shows 0. 56 n-gain. And than, the result of Wilcoxon test with assymp sig is 0, 000. Because asymp sig 0, 000 < 0, 05,Ha is rejected and H 0 is accepted.
