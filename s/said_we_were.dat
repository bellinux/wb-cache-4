5|$|There {{was this}} {{absolute}} scorching deal on cases of PBR and kegs. We {{were one of}} the few outlets in Portland that sold kegs to go, so we could sell them at a really good deal. So we started the PBR dollar-can special. I'd say it was around 1997 or 1998. At one point, I know they <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> the largest distributor of Pabst in the state, if not the country. We got written up in The New York Times about it. We were going through hundreds of cases and dozens of kegs a week.|$|E
5|$|What Arafat {{says about}} me doesn't bother me. Not only he, {{but also a}} whole list of Arab and world {{politicians}} claim that I am an agent of the Zionists or the CIA. Others state that I am a mercenary of the French secret service and of the Soviet KGB. The latest rumor is that I am an agent of Khomeini. During a certain period they <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> spies for the Iraqi regime. Now they say that we are Syrian agents.... Many psychologists and sociologists in the Soviet bloc tried to investigate this man Abu Nidal. They wanted to find a weak point in his character. The result was zero.|$|E
500|$|Lautner {{has stated}} {{that he does not}} want to be just known for his looks, as some have {{attributed}} his popularity to that and not his actual acting skill. In an interview, the actor revealed that he was originally supposed to have a baring scene in the movie Valentine's Day. He stated, [...] "The script <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> walking into school and Willy takes off his shirt. I said, 'Whoa, whoa, whoa. Time out. He's gonna take off his shirt in the middle of school? No, no, no. The reason I took off my shirt for New Moon is because it's written in the book that way. And there's reasons behind it." [...] Lautner later said he would not bare his chest for any role that did not call for it. In June 2010, Lautner covered GQ magazine. The actor was lampooned in conservative writer Laura Ingraham's satirical The Obama Diaries, commenting to have Lautner as a mascot for the White House Easter Egg Roll, to fit their health-conscious theme, and have Lautner don a furry bunny head and appear shirtless. In 2010, Lautner was ranked number two on Glamours [...] "50 Sexiest Men of 2010 [...] " [...] list. Men's Health ranked him at third on their list of [...] "Top 10 Summer Bodies." [...] Additionally in 2010, he was ranked fourth on Peoples [...] "Most Amazing Bodies" [...] list.|$|E

500|$|Monica Herrera of Billboard {{gave the}} single a mixed review, stating that Minaj, being [...] "one {{of the most}} {{visually}} distinctive rappers to come along in years", that the single was an [...] "anticlimatic coming out song", [...] "considering the hype Minaj has generated through mixtapes, cameos and her co-starring role in Lil Wayne's Young Money project". However Hererra did commend the lyrical content, stating [...] "her sassy one-liners are as entertaining as always", and the overall production although it didn't suit Minaj's [...] "her mental-patient delivery nearly as well as, say, Kane Beatz' simpler track for Young Money's [...] "BedRock". Robbie Daw of 'Idolator' said, [...] "we wouldn’t expect Nicki to do any less than {{come out of the}} gate charging full force, lyrically, on her debut single. That <b>said,</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> expecting maybe a tad more of a melody on the track." [...] Chris Ryan of 'MTV Buzzworthy' gave the song a positive review, stating [...] "you get the feeling, listening to the song's air-raid keyboards and thunderous beats, that the Young Money princess really wants to separate herself from the rap pack and carve out a space all her own". Ryan also said, [...] "her verbal dexterity, complex flow and humor, Nicki is reminiscent of classic Missy Elliott -- and that's a compliment of the highest order".|$|E
500|$|In the EuroBasket 2005, Nowitzki {{came back}} strong. He {{surprisingly}} led a depleted German squad into the Finals, beating title favorites Slovenia in the quarter-finals and Spain in the semi-finals on the way. EuroBasket pundits praised Nowitzki in both matches: against Slovenia (76–62), the forward scored a game high 22 points and commented: [...] "The Slovenians underestimated us. They <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> the team they wanted {{and that was}} wrong, you shouldn't {{do that in the}} quarter-finals." [...] Against Spain (74–73), Nowitzki scored a game-high 27 points and scored the decisive basket: down by one and with only a few seconds to go, he drove on Spanish forward Jorge Garbajosa, and hit a baseline jump shot over Garbajosa's outstretched arms with 3.9 seconds to go. The German later commented: [...] "It was indescribable. Garbajosa kind of pushed me towards the baseline so I just went with it." [...] Despite losing the Finals, 78–62, to the Greeks, Nowitzki was the tournament's leading scorer (26.7 per game) and second-leading rebounder (10.8 per game) and shot blocker (1.8 per game), and was voted Most Valuable Player of the tournament. When he was subbed out {{towards the end of the}} final, Nowitzki received standing ovation from the crowd, which he later recalled as [...] "one of the best moments of [...] career". In the 2006 FIBA World Championship, Nowitzki led the German team to an eighth place and commented: [...] "It's tough luck. But overall, finishing eighth in the world is not bad." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{a series}} of low scores, Best was dropped after just three Tests. He felt aggrieved: [...] "I was the most {{disappointed}} and hurt man in the world, he <b>said.</b> <b>We</b> <b>were</b> 3–0 up, no pressure was on us and I was unceremoniously discarded. I {{never had a chance}} to develop." ...|$|E

And, yeah, like I <b>said,</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> proud of how much we toured. We were-it was a badge of honour to play as much as possible.|$|E
2500|$|The {{press in}} Australia and England blamed the hype {{surrounding}} Kerry Packer and his proposed World Series Cricket for tension within the Australian side (Malone had already signed a contract), {{leading to the}} poor performances. Malone disagrees, [...] "The press <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> a divided side," [...] says Malone, [...] "but {{that was not the}} case. There were 13 of the 17 players who had signed for Packer and we all knew each other and got on, Packer and non-Packer players. The reason we lost was because we were outplayed by a better side and because Geoff Boycott was sensational." ...|$|E

People {{just like to}} have go at other artists. But we are very good friends with Jimi now". Years later, Gibb recalled: [...] "He was a great mate of mine. He came to my twenty-first birthday. He was an {{extremely}} polite bloke. I never knew about the drugs then. I thought he was acting a bit weird and saying kind of remote things, but I was too naive to even consider {{that it might be}} drugs, I never caught on with Jimi and the drugs. I saw him drunk a few times because I remember thinking he was always really quiet until he had a few drinks"[...]|$|E

2500|$|Voris's {{sessions}} were titled [...] "No Bull in Madrid" [...] {{and focused on}} addressing [...] "tough issues concerning sexuality and morals facing Catholic youth today." [...] Voris stated that he was puzzled why such a statement was released when [...] "e never <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> part of the official World Youth Day" [...] and noted that official approval was not necessary to present talks or do news reportage at WYD. He also indicated further puzzlement {{as to why the}} organization he represented (called RealCatholicTV.com at the time) was singled out when there were many other unapproved apostolates at WYD. Voris also noted that no one was challenging any of the theological content in his catechesis, nor had any church official ever challenged any of the content in any Catholic program he had ever been a part of.|$|E
2500|$|The witness {{tampering}} {{charges were}} based on text messages Ravi sent to Wei, in which he tried to persuade her not to contradict what he had told police. In these messages, Ravi said [...] "Did you tell them we did it on purpose?", and [...] "Because I <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> just messing around with the camera." [...] Wei responded [...] "Omg dharun why didnt u talk to me first i told them everything". According to a prosecution expert witness, Ravi deleted almost 100 text messages between him and Wei and another high school friend, whom he had invited to view Clementi's second encounter with his guest. A key aspect of the prosecution's evidence tampering charge was Ravi's deletion of two potentially incriminating postings: one on Twitter on September 19 in which he wrote that his roommate was [...] "making out with a dude. Yay", and one on September 21 in which he told his iChat followers [...] "dare you to video chat me" [...] {{during the time of}} Clementi's tryst. He replaced the latter post with one that said [...] "don't you dare video chat me" [...] {{at the time of the}} tryst, stating that the first message was a draft. Ravi was charged with third and fourth degree invasion of privacy.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked on}} Good Game: Spawn Point about their {{credibility}} in reviewing games when they're [...] "both {{too old to}} understand games from a spawnlings perspective", Bajo and Hex responded: [...] "We may not be quite as young as some of you spawnlings [...] but all those years have been spent playing games, giving {{us a lot of}} the experience and expertise required for the kind of thorough games criticism we provide." [...] When asked if they are pro gamers, Bajo and Hex explained that in truth they aren't, as [...] "a pro gamer is someone who plays games professionally at the highest competitive levels in tournaments... so we don't really fit that description, and pro gamers around the world would scoff if we ever <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> [...] "pro"." [...] They added that their job as game critics is not to be {{the best of the best}} at any one particular game, but to [...] "be ok at all types of games so we can review and compare them to help you decide if you want to play them." [...] They said they review bad games along with good games as they can't know what quality the game will be until they've actually played it, and also if all the reviewed games were given highly positive reviews, they reviews would be redundant and their rating system meaningless. Also, as games are expensive, the team want to warn viewers about what games they should avoid. They have also stated they make an effort to review games on all consoles.|$|E
