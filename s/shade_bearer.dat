50|$|Originally a tree of {{tropical}} rainforest, {{it needs a}} hot humid climate, but can withstand a dry season on sites with a high ground water level. It may be cultivated in drier areas where ground water is available. C. nitida is a <b>shade</b> <b>bearer,</b> but develops a better spreading crown which yields more fruits in open places. Though it is a lowland forest tree, {{it has been found}} at altitudes over 300 m on deep, rich soils under heavy and evenly distributed rainfall.|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyzed}} {{the interaction between}} lianas and tree seedlings in contrasting canopy openness environments.   For this purpose tree and liana seedlings with distinct light requirements were planted in large and small gaps and in the forest understorey in a tropical moist semideciduous forest in Ghana.   The competition for above- and below-ground resources between liana and tree seedlings was also evaluated under two levels of irradiance (7 and 27 % PAR) in a shadehouse environment.   The rates of growth and photosynthetic response to changes in irradiance were also compared between liana and pioneer tree seedlings in a greenhouse. The data showed that canopy openness moderated the interaction between liana and tree seedlings.   The direction of the interaction was both liana and tree species specific.   Liana competition effects were stronger in the sites with greater canopy openness and on {{the growth of the}} non-pioneer light demander tree, while the pioneer and non-pioneer <b>shade</b> <b>bearer</b> trees were less affected.   By having differential effects on the trees, lianas could indirectly promote the regeneration of both the pioneers and the more shade tolerant species.   The competition for below-ground resources had the main effects on the interaction within the first year.   An increase in the effects of the above-ground competition could be expected in later years.   The photosynthetic response to the increase in irradiance was similar among pioneer trees and liana species.   The results indicated that lianas can limit the regeneration in big forest canopy gaps in tropical forests by outcompeting tree seedlings.   Lianas might affect the forest community by altering the competitive ability of tree species during regeneration.

40|$|To answer new {{scientific}} and ecological questions and monitor multiple forest changes, a fine scale characterization of these ecosystems is needed, and could imply the mapping of specific species, of detailed forest types, and of functional composition. This characterization can be now {{provided by the}} novel Earth Observation tools. This study aims to contribute to understanding the innovation in forest and ecological research that can be brought in by advanced remote sensing instruments, and proposes the guild mapping approach {{as a tool to}} efficiently monitor the varied tropical forest resources. We evaluated, in tropical Ghanaian forests, the ability of airborne hyperspectral and simulated multispectral Sentinel- 2 data, and derived vegetation indices and textures, to: distinguish between two different forest types; to discriminate among selected dominant species; and to separate trees species grouped according to their functional guilds: Pioneer, Non Pioneer Light Demanding, and <b>Shade</b> <b>Bearer.</b> We then produced guild classification maps for each area using hyperspectral data. Our results showed that with both hyperspectral and simulated Sentinel- 2 data these discrimination tasks can be successfully accomplished. Results also stressed the importance of texture features, especially if using the lower spectral and spatial Sentinel- 2 resolution data, and highlighted the important role of the new Sentinel- 2 data for ecological monitoring. Classification results showed a statistically significant improvement in overall accuracy using Support Vector Machine, over Maximum Likelihood approach. We proposed the functional guilds mapping as an innovative approach to: (i) monitor compositional changes, especially with respect to the effects of global climate change on forests, and particularly in the tropical biome where the occurrence of hundreds of species prevents mapping activities at species level; (ii) support large-scale forest inventories. The imminent Sentinel- 2 data could serve to open the road for the development of new concepts and methods in forestry and ecological research...|$|E
40|$|Architecture {{refers to}} the overall shape of a tree and the spatial {{position}} of its components. Tree height determines the position in the forest canopy and access to light, while the amount and spatial distribution of the foliage depend on the depth and {{the width of the}} crown. The aim {{of this study is to}} understand how tree architecture varies across coexisting tropical tree species and relates to functional traits. Forty five coexisting tree species were sampled in the semi-deciduous forests of Northern Congo. Species were classified according to ecological strategies, specifically regeneration guilds: <b>shade</b> <b>bearers</b> (27 species), non-pioneers light demanding (14 species) and pioneers (4 species). For each species, 14 – 72 trees (968 trees in total) were measured over a large range of diameter (10 – 162 cm). At the tree level, we measured the diameter (D in cm), height (H in m), crown radius (Cr in m) and crown depth (Cd in m) and crown exposure index (CEI) was visually estimated. At species level, architectural traits (Dmax, Hmax, Crmax and Cdmax), life history traits (dispersal mode, phenology and guild) and functional traits (wood density and light requirement) were obtained. We investigates the H-D, Cr-D and Cd-D allometric relationships at the tree level using linear mixed models on log-transformed data with species as a random effect on both slope and intercept. We used the multivariate analysis to quantify the relationship between architectural, functional traits and life history traits. Based on AIC, we found that the best linear mixed model was the one with two species random parameters (intercept and slope) for H-D and Cr-D allometries, while the best model for Cd-D allometry was the one with only a random intercept. Thus, our results showed a significant variation in tree allometry between coexisting species. The interspecific variation in H-D allometry was related to light requirement while Cr-D and Cd-D allometries were more related to dispersal mode and wood density, respectively. The confirmed the existence of three ecological strategies (<b>shade</b> <b>bearers,</b> non-pioneers light demanding and pioneers) in tropical forests, specifically in Central Africa. Architectural traits were the main traits that differentiate between ecological strategies. Architectural traits are therefore strong predictors of ecological strategies of coexisting tropical tree species. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{concerns}} in forestry in the tropics {{is the lack of}} information on the impact of canopy disturbance through logging. The degree of canopy opening that should be allowed during logging to enhance natural regeneration of timber tree species is not known. Information on the seedling ecology of individual species and ecological species groups on which to base management decisions are also lacking. Experiments to determine the ecophysiological responses of seedlings of timber tree species to different irradiances in two forest sites were carried out. The two forest reserves are Nkrabia and Tinte Bepo in the Moist Evergreen and Moist Semi-Deciduous Forest Types, respectively. Eight species, representing three <b>Shade</b> <b>Bearers,</b> four Non-Pioneer Light Demanders and one Pioneer species, were grown in a series of artificially-created gaps in two forest sites differing in annual rainfall. The forest shade received 1 - 2 % irradiance, while the artificial gaps received 5, 10, 15, 30 and 65 % irradiance. Seedling growth was greater at Nkrabia Forest Reserve (Moist Evergreen Forest Type) than at Tinte Bepo Forest Reserve (Moist Semi-Deciduous Forest Type). This is probably due to the lower soil moisture stress at Nkrabia as a result of more rainfall. Lower moisture stress at Nkrabia may also explain the greater leaf area and specific leaf area ratios, lower leaf turnover and lower number of smal...|$|R

Our results showed a significant variation in tree allometry between coexisting species. The interspecific variation was related to light requirement (H-D allometry), dispersal mode (Cr-D allometry) and liana infestation (Cd-D allometry). Large-statured tree species were light demanding, deciduous and wind dispersed, while small-statured tree species were evergreen, dense wooded, and animal dispersed. Architectural traits strongly differed between regeneration guilds. Peer reviewe...|$|R
