40|$|A {{majority}} of currently used anticancer drugs {{belong to a}} group of chemical agents that damage DNA. The efficiency of the treatment is limited by effective DNA repair systems functioning in cancer cells. Many chemotherapeutic compounds cause strong systemic toxicity. Therefore, there is still a need for new anticancer agents which are less toxic for nontransformed cells and selectively kill cancer cells. One of the most promising molecular targets in cancer therapy is poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP). PARP play an essential role in repairing DNA strand breaks. Small molecule inhibitors of these enzymes have been developed and have proved to be extremely toxic for cancer cells that lack the functional BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 proteins that are involved in homologous recombination, a complex repair mechanism of DNA double strand breaks. Mutations in BRCA 1 / 2 genes are associated with genetically inherited breast and ovarian cancers. Therefore PARP inhibitors may prove to be very effective and <b>selective</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> of these cancer types. This review is focused on the function of BRCA 1 / 2 proteins and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases in DNA repair systems, especially in the homologous recombination process. A short history of the studies that led to synthesis of high specificity small molecule PARP inhibitors is also presented, as well as the results of clinical trials concerning the most effective PARP inhibitors in view of their potential application in oncological treatment, particularly breast cancers...|$|E

40|$|Tumor {{necrosis}} factor α (TNF-α) {{is the key}} mediator of superantigen-induced T cell lethal shock.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare the effects of {{selective}} phosphodiesterase (PDE) 3, 4 and 5 inhibitors on antigen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in sensitized guinea-pigs. When the sensitized guinea-pigs were orally pre-treated with the selective PDE 4 inhibitor, Ro 20 - 1724 (30 mg/kg), and studied 48 h after OA, a significant reduction (p< 0. 01) of the leftward shift of the dose-response curve to ACh was noted, whereas it was ineffective at the lower dose (10 mg/kg). Administration of the selective PDE 3 inhibitor, milrinone (30 mg/kg) also elicited a significant reduction (p< 0. 01) of the airway hyperresponsiveness, whereas the PDE 5 inhibitor zaprinast (30 mg/kg) was ineffective.

40|$|Heart {{failure is}} {{characterized}} by limited exercise tolerance and by a skeletal muscle myopathy with atrophy and shift toward fast fibres. An inflammatory status with elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines and exaggerated free radicals production, can worsen muscle damage. In a well established model of heart failure, the monocrotaline treated rat, we show that CHF is accompanied by oxidation of the skeletal muscle actin, tropomyosin and myosin, which further depresses muscle function and exercise capacity. We have also tested the efficacy of Carvedilol, a non-selective beta(1) -beta(2) -blocker, which has been widely used in clinical trials to improve exercise tolerance and reduce mortality in moderate and severe CHF, in preventing contractile protein oxidation in CHF rats. As comparison we used Bisoprolol a beta(1) selective agent, without known anti-oxidative properties. Carvedilol at the dose of 2 mg/kg per day was able to prevent the myofibrillar protein oxidation, while Bisoprolol (0. 1 mg/kg) did it only partially, {{as demonstrated by the}} oxyblot analysis. While Carvedilol improved force production on isolated muscles, Bisoprolol did not. After the COMET trial, the anti-oxidative capacity of Carvedilol has been invoked as one of the mechanism that makes this drug superior to other <b>selective</b> beta-blockers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> of CHF. One of the reason of Carvedilol superiority could be the effect on skeletal muscle with reduction of contractile protein peroxidation, amelioration of muscle function and improvement of exercise tolerance.

40|$|THESIS 7325 <b>The</b> work {{described}} <b>in</b> {{this thesis}} {{consists of the}} synthesis and biological evaluation {{of a series of}} reduced isoquinoline derivatives. MAO is an enzyme involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> metabolic degradation of catecholamine neurotransmitters. Human MAO exists as two isozymes - MAO-A and MAO-B. Selective MAO-A and MAO-B inhibitors are used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> of depression and Parkinson?s disease respectively. Naturally occurring salsolinol and related isoquinoline alkaloids {{have been shown to be}} inhibitors of MAO. Isoquinolines are discussed with regard to their natural occurrence and pharmacological activities, particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of MAO inhibition. Certain isoquinoline derivatives have shown potential as combined MAO-B/COMT inhibitors. COMT inhibitors may be used <b>in</b> combination with <b>selective</b> MAO-B inhibitors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> of Parkinson?s disease.

40|$|PURPOSE. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{mouse model}} of oxygen-induced {{retinopathy}} (OIR) somatostatin (SRIF) acting at the SRIF receptor subtype 2 (sst 2) inhibits angiogenic responses to hypoxia through a downregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor. Information on the sites where SRIF-sst 2 interactions take place is lacking, and downstream effectors mediating SRIF-sst 2 antiangiogenic actions are unknown. METHODS. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> OIR model, retinal expression of SRIF was evaluated with RT-PCR and RIA. The bindings of [125 I]LTT-SRIF- 28 and [125 I]Tyr 3 -octreotide were measured in coronal {{sections of the}} eye. With Western blot we evaluated the levels of sst 2 A {{as well as the}} expression and the activity of the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) 3. The analysis of STAT 3 was performed in hypoxic mice treated with the sst 2 agonist octreotide or with the sst 2 antagonist D-Tyr 8 cyanamid 154806 (CYN). Retinal localization of sst 2 A was assessed by single and double immunohistochemistry with an endothelial cell marker. RESULTS. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> hypoxic retina, both SRIF and sst 2 levels as well as [125 I]Tyr 3 -octreotide binding were downregulated. In addition, sst 2 A immunostaining was decreased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neuroretina, but was increased in capillaries. Hypoxia increased both expression and activity of STAT 3. This increase was inhibited by octreotide, while was strengthened by CYN. CONCLUSIONS. These data suggest that i. sst 2 expressed by capillaries may be responsible of the antiangiogenic effects of SRIF and ii. downstream effectors in this action include the transcription factor STAT 3. These results support the possibility of using sst 2 - <b>selective</b> ligands <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> of proliferative retinopathies and indicate STAT 3 as an additional target for novel therapeutic approach.

40|$|The {{etiology}} of {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD) is not completely understood, thus current therapies have been empirical and directed at treating symptoms rather than addressing <b>the</b> cause. <b>In</b> IBD, <b>the</b> overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin- 1 beta, interleukin- 6, leads to a persistent intestinal inflammatory response that damages the intestinal mucosa. Recent advances in pharmacologic therapies that target specific cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules have proved successful in alleviating symptoms for some patients. There are 2 selective adsorption apheresis devices that remove leukocytes from whole blood, which are currently available in Japan and Europe-the Cellsorba leukocytapheresis column and the Adacolumn adsorptive extracorporeal granulocyte/monocyte apheresis device. The purported mechanisms of action of these devices have been extensively reviewed and are believed to exert an immunomodulatory and/or anti-inflammatory effect on patients with systemic inflammatory disease.

We have compared the toxicities of 2 ′-deoxyadenosine, 2 ′-deoxyguanosine, and thymidine for T cell lines derived from patients with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia with those for mature T cell lines derived from patients with cutaneous T cell leukaemia/lymphoma. We have found that both deoxynucleosides are far less toxic to the mature T cell lies than to T lymphoblasts and that the mature cells accumulate much lower amounts of dATP and dGTP when exposed to deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine, respectively. Similar studies performed on peripheral blood cells from patients with T cell leukaemias of mature phenotype and on peripheral blood T cells demonstrate similar low amounts of deoxynucleotide accumulation. Measurements of the activities of several purine metabolizing enzymes that participate in deoxynucleoside phosphorylation or degradation do not reveal differences which would explain the toxicity of deoxynucleosides for immature, as compared to mature, T cells. We conclude that deoxynucleoside metabolism in leukaemic T cells varies with their degree of differentiation.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{study was}} a prospective, {{randomized}} evaluation of parietal cell vagotomy (PCV) and <b>selective</b> vagotomy-antrectomy (SV-A) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> of duodenal ulcer. BACKGROUND DATA: Operative treatment of duodenal ulcer is associated with mortality and mechanical and metabolic morbidity. At the time that surgeons appear to have succeeded in developing operations with low morbidity and mortality, {{the number of patients}} requiring elective operation has decreased partly because of the simultaneous, dramatic improvement in medical therapy. Nevertheless, surgical therapy still is important, especially in certain socioeconomic environments. METHODS: After a pilot study of PCV, 200 patients with duodenal ulcers were randomized to PCV or SV-A. One surgeon was responsible for the operations and follow-up studies. An attempt was made to evaluate all patients annually <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hospital. Gastric analyses were performed on each visit, for which the patient gave his/her consent. RESULTS: There was no operative mortality. The recurrence rate-by-life table analysis was less (p < 0. 003) after SV-A than PCV. Dumping was greater (p < 0. 001), and there was no difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> frequency of diarrhea after SV-A compared with PCV. The percentage of patients with grades Visick I or Visick II was not different for the two operations, but more patients were graded Visick I after PCV than after SV-A. CONCLUSIONS: Selective vagotomy-antrectomy and parietal cell vagotomy are effective and safe operations, when used appropriately. Selective vagotomy-antrectomy is preferable for patients with pyloric and prepyloric ulcers and pyloric obstruction. Parietal cell vagotomy is the authors' choice for duodenal ulcer patients because of the occasional patient who becomes disabled by SV-A...|$|R

Our group showed that Th 2 cells selectively overexpressed voltage-activated calcium (Cav 1) -related channels. An increasing number of groups report the presence of Cav 1 -related products in T-lymphocyte subsets. This {{is a matter of}} debate since these calcium channels are classically defined as activated by high cell membrane depolarization in excitable cells. However, the use of mice with ablation of some Cav 1 subunits shows undoubtedly an immune phenotype raising the question of how Cav 1 channels are regulated in lymphocytes. We showed that knocking down Cav 1. 2 and/or Cav 1. 3 subunits impairs the functions of Th 2 lymphocytes and is beneficial in experimental models of asthma, while it has no effect on Th 1 cell functions. Beyond the role of Cav 1 channels <b>in</b> T-lymphocytes, <b>the</b> identification of key components selectively implicated <b>in</b> one or <b>the</b> other T cell subset paves the way for the design of new <b>selective</b> therapeutic targets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> of immune disorders while preserving the other T-cell subsets.

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests the Akt-mTOR pathway {{may play a}} role in development of low-grade gliomas (LGG). We sought to evaluate whether activation of this pathway correlates with survival in LGG by examining expression patterns of proteins within this pathway. Forty-five LGG tumor specimens from newly diagnosed patients were analyzed for methylation of the putative 5 ′-promoter region of PTEN using methylation-specific PCR as well as phosphorylation of S 6 and PRAS 40 and expression of PTEN protein using immunohistochemistry. Relationships between molecular markers and overall survival (OS) were assessed using Kaplan-Meier methods and exact log-rank test. Correlation between molecular markers was determined using the Mann-Whitney U and Spearman Rank Correlation tests. Eight of the 26 patients with methylated PTEN died, as compared to 1 of 19 without methylation. There was a trend towards statistical significance, with PTEN methylated patients having decreased survival (P =  0. 128). Eight of 29 patients that expressed phospho-S 6 died, whereas all 9 patients lacking p-S 6 expression were alive at last follow-up. There was an inverse relationship between expression of phospho-S 6 and survival (P =  0. 029). There was a trend towards decreased survival in patients expressing phospho-PRAS 40 (P =  0. 077). Analyses of relationships between molecular markers demonstrated a statistically significant positive correlation between expression of p-S 6 (235) and p-PRAS 40 (P =  0. 04); expression of p-S 6 (240) correlated positively with PTEN methylation (P =  0. 04) and negatively with PTEN expression (P =  0. 03). Survival of LGG patients correlates with phosphorylation of S 6 protein. This relationship supports the use of <b>selective</b> mTOR inhibitors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> of low grade glioma...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveSeveral {{trials have}} {{reported}} early superior patency of stenting over isolated angioplasty (plain old balloon angioplasty [POBA]) for infra-inguinal occlusive disease, yet long-term data are sparse. The {{purpose of this}} study was to contrast long-term clinical outcomes and costs of angioplasty alone vs angioplasty with <b>selective</b> stenting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> of femoropopliteal occlusive disease. MethodsPatients undergoing primary endovascular <b>treatments</b> of <b>the</b> native femoropopliteal arteries from 2002 to 2009 were divided into two groups, POBA alone or stenting based on final treatment received at their index procedure. Study end points included actuarial 5 -year primary patency (using strict criteria of any hemodynamic deterioration or return of symptoms), 5 -year limb salvage, and 5 -year survival and hospital costs. ResultsEight hundred twenty-four primary procedures were performed during the study interval; 517 (63 %) were POBA and 307 (37 %) were stenting. The mean follow-up duration was 33 months (range, 0 - 98 months). The indication for intervention <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stenting group was claudication in 71 % of the patients, whereas the remaining 29 % had critical limb ischemia (CLI). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> POBA cohort, <b>the</b> indication for <b>treatment</b> was claudication in 59 % of the patients and CLI <b>in</b> <b>the</b> remaining 41 %. A higher percentage of POBA lesions were TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) II A & B when compared to stenting (91 % POBA vs 73 % stenting; P <. 001). There was no difference in overall 5 -year primary patency (POBA 36 % ± 3 %; stenting 41 % ± 4 %; P =. 31), nor was there a difference in patients with claudication (POBA 42 % ± 4 %; stenting 45 % ± 4 %; P =. 8). In patients with CLI, the 4 -year primary patency was 27 % ± 5 % (POBA) vs 36 % ± 8 % (stenting), P =. 22; the 4 -year limb salvage was 80 % ± 4 % (POBA) vs 90 % ± 5 % (stenting), P =. 18. There was no difference <b>in</b> survival between <b>the</b> two groups (claudication: 83 % ± 3 % POBA vs 84 % ± 4 % stenting at 5 years (P =. 65), CLI: 44 % ± 4 % POBA vs 49 % ± 6 % stenting at 4 years (P =. 40). Subgroup analysis by lesion anatomy showed similar primary patency between POBA and stenting for TASC II A & B lesions, while the primary patency was significantly higher at 5 years after stenting of TASC II C & D lesions (34 % ± 6 % vs 12 % ± 9 %; P <. 05). Stenting increased the procedural cost by 57 % when compared to POBA (P <. 001) regardless of treatment indication. In addition, stenting added 45 % (P <. 001) to the overall hospital cost of patients treated for claudication. ConclusionStenting resulted in equivalent long-term outcomes compared to POBA when stratified by indications. However, stenting yielded statistically better primary patency in patients with TASC II C & D lesions. The lack of improved clinical outcomes and significantly higher cost of stenting supports a posture of selective use of stents (especially in TASC II A & B) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> endovascular <b>treatment</b> of femoropopliteal occlusive disease...|$|R
40|$|Background Glaucoma is a {{major cause}} of {{blindness}} worldwide. The affected population was projected to increase from 60. 5 million in 2010 to 79. 6 million <b>in</b> 2020. Among <b>the</b> various types of glaucoma, primary open angle glaucoma will account for more than 70 % of this population. <b>Treatment</b> by lowering <b>the</b> intraocular pressure is the only proven method to reduce progression. This can be achieved via medication, surgery and laser. Selective laser trabeculoplasty is a relatively new type of laser that is reported to be equally efficacious to a first line medication and other established laser trabeculoplasty, namely argon laser trabeculoplasty. The evidence available, however, is limited to single trials, which may not reach adequate power to detect the difference. A systematic review and meta-analysis would add evidence to consider selective laser trabeculoplasty as an alternative treatment option in open angle glaucoma through assessing its efficacy and effectiveness <b>in</b> lowering <b>the</b> intraocular pressure and through testing for its non-inferiority when compared with other conventional treatment modalities. Method Literature search of Pubmed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, dissertation and thesis databases and hand search of relevant journals was performed for the use of <b>selective</b> laser trabeculoplasty <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> of open angle glaucoma. English and Chinese articles were included. Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing treatment efficacy of selective laser trabeculoplasty and other treatment modalities were performed where appropriate. Results 80 articles were identified to be relevant and provided sufficient data for interpretation for efficacy or safety assessment. It was estimated that selective laser trabeculoplasty resulted in a weighted pooled mean intraocular pressure reduction of 21. 9 to 23. 8 % at different follow-up durations. However, sensitivity analysis including only prospective studies with baseline IOP less than 21 mmHg did not show significant IOP lowering effect. Review on side effects of selective laser trabeculoplasty showed a good safety profile in general. Rare occurrences of more severe or long-term complications included persistent intraocular pressure spike requiring surgery, persistent macular edema and corneal haze. Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showed that selective laser trabeculoplasty is non-inferior to argon laser trabeculoplasty and medication in intraocular pressure reduction and also in achieving treatment success. Number of medication reduction is similar between selective laser trabeculoplasty and argon laser trabeculoplasty. Conclusion This report demonstrated comparable efficacy of selective laser trabeculoplasty with argon laser trabeculoplasty and medication therapy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> of open angle glaucoma. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|R

MethodsA retrospective {{analysis was performed}} for the clinical data of 60 patients with primary liver cancer complicated by portal hypertension who were treated <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Second People′s Hospital of Zhenjiang from March 2013 to February 2016. According to the surgical procedure, the patients were divided into group A (32 patients) and group B (28 patients). <b>The</b> patients <b>in</b> group A were given liver cancer resection combined with splenectomy, and those in group B were given liver cancer resection combined with selective decongestive devascularization. The patients’ general status <b>in</b> <b>the</b> perioperative period were observed, and immune function parameters and liver function parameters were compared {{between the two groups}} before and after surgery, as well as the incidence of complications. The t-test was used for comparison of continuous data between groups, and the chi-square test was used for comparison of categorical data between groups. ResultsCompared with group A, group B had a significantly longer time of operation (135. 27 ± 15. 13 min vs 118. 35 ± 12. 56 min, t=- 4. 733, P＜ 0. 001) and a significantly shorter length of hospital stay (14. 28 ± 2. 95 d vs 16. 37 ± 3. 42 d, t= 2. 516, P= 0. 007). At 1 month after surgery, group B had significantly higher levels of IgG, IgM, and IgA than group A ［(14. 98 ± 3. 12 ） vs (12. 51 ± 2. 75) 、(2. 79 ± 1. 13) vs (2. 25 ± 1. 02) ，(2. 42 ± 0. 79) vs (1. 87 ± 0. 82) ，t=- 3. 260, - 1. 945, and - 2. 636, P＜ 0. 001, = 0. 028, and ＜ 0. 005 ］. At 1 month after surgery, both groups showed significant increases in platelet count (t=- 89. 590 and - 20. 261, both P＜ 0. 001), and group A showed a significantly greater increase than group B ［(302. 46 ± 15. 08) × 109 /L vs (80. 25 ± 5. 68) × 109 /L，t= 73. 481, P＜ 0. 001 ］. There were no significant differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> incidence rates of postoperative complications between the two groups (18. 75 % vs 17. 86 %， χ 2 = 0. 008, P= 0. 929).

40|$|AbstractBackground: Patients {{who require}} {{angioplasty}} and stenting of multiple iliac arterial segments often require reintervention to maintain long-term patency. Morphologic predictors and causes of failure are unknown. The {{purpose of the}} current study was to define arteriographic predictors of angioplasty and <b>selective</b> stent failure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> of multisegment iliac occlusive disease. Methods: All iliac segments (two common and two external) of 75 patients who underwent angioplasty and selective stent placement for multisegment iliac occlusive disease (≥ two segments) were scored through use of a modification of the Society of Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology classification for iliac angioplasty (0 = no lesion; 4 = most severe). Total iliac score was calculated by summing scores from each segment. A separate external iliac score was calculated by adding only the external iliac scores. Arteriograms were reviewed initially and at the time of lesion recurrence and stratified by lesion location and previous intervention. Results: The area of previous endovascular intervention was the site of recurrence in 75 % of patients. New lesions, presumably a result of progressive atherosclerosis, occurred in 15 % of patients, and lesions occurred in both new and previously treated iliac segments in 10 % of patients. Only the external iliac score was an independent predictor of failed endovascular therapy despite reintervention. For patients with an external iliac score of 2 or less, the endovascular primary-assisted patency rates at 6, 12, and 24 months were 96 %, 92 %, and 89 %, respectively. This was improved <b>in</b> comparison with <b>the</b> 90 %, 63 %, and 45 % patency rates observed in patients with an external iliac score of 3 or more (P =. 001). Patients with an external iliac score of 3 or more had a significantly lower incidence of hemodynamic and clinical improvement after intervention and a threefold higher need for surgical inflow procedures than patients with an external iliac score of 2 or less. Conclusions: Lesion formation after treatment of multisegment iliac occlusive disease typically occurs in areas of prior intervention. The extent of external iliac disease can be used to stratify patients with multisegment iliac occlusive disease who will likely respond to endovascular treatment with a durable result. Patients with extensive external iliac disease (score ≥ 3) have poor results after angioplasty and selective stenting as applied in this study, even with endovascular reintervention. They are ideal subjects for prospective comparative studies of competing initial therapies, including stenting, endografting, and aortobifemoral bypass grafting.
