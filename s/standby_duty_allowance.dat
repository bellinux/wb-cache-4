40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to assess the}} effects of motivation on employee performance using field data collected at Vice President’s Office in Dar es Salaam. Correlation technique was employed {{to find out the}} relationship between two variables. Regression technique also was used to find out to which extent one variable affect the other using coefficient results. Correlation results for salary is 0. 589, Transport benefits 0. 421, medical benefits 0. 395, extra <b>duty</b> <b>allowance</b> 0. 421, carrier achievement 0. 562, promotion benefits 0. 672 and correlation for recognition is 0. 407 which reveal existence of positive relationship between motivation and employees’ performance and therefore implying that the increase in motivation will lead to increase in employees’ performance. This situation insists on increasing attention to employee motivation practice in order to improve employee performance. The findings suggest enhancement of current motivation package by incorporating both intrinsic such as promotion, recognition, support for carrier achievement and extrinsic motivation factors such as salary, extra <b>duty</b> <b>allowance,</b> transport allowance, medical benefits will help optimum utilization of human resources as well as increasing employees’ performance. Furthermore there is pressing need to develop organisation motivation policy that will help the VPO management properly handling motivation function...|$|R
