5|$|Technology is {{researched}} {{at specific}} buildings, {{to which they}} are generally related; for example, religious research is done in temples and improved armor is researched in the <b>storage</b> <b>pit.</b> Technological advances come in many categories, such as military upgrades (better arms and armor for units), economic upgrades (increasing the efficiency of resource gathering), religious upgrades (faster conversion rates and more abilities for priests) and infrastructure upgrades (stronger fortifications and more resilient buildings). As basic technology research is completed, more advanced technologies may become available. Some technologies are not available to certain civilizations.|$|E
25|$|It is {{determined}} that the leak into the cable <b>storage</b> <b>pit</b> from unit 2 was likely due to a faulty joint where the pit meets a duct. The pit leads to a gravel layer beneath, resulting in highly radioactive water pouring directly into the sea.|$|E

TEPCO then reattempts to plug up the trench {{that leads to the}} damaged <b>storage</b> <b>pit</b> with a combination of superabsorbent polymer, sawdust and shredded newspaper, which also fails. Radioactive water continues to leak into the sea. Radiation levels around the plant are estimated at 1Sv/h and continue to decrease.|$|E

Large <b>storage</b> <b>pits</b> were built underground to conceal their presence, a preferred method used by mobile populations {{in many parts of}} the world.|$|R
50|$|The site {{contained}} {{large numbers}} of pits of four different types: <b>storage</b> <b>pits,</b> fire pits (possibly used for baking), hearths, and smudge pits (found to contain Eastern complex corn).|$|R
50|$|Maize was {{ground with}} manos and metates. Cooking pots {{were used to}} prepare food. These {{processing}} tools were present during the San Francisco Phase and increased in complexity and use during the Three Circle Phase due to greater dependency upon maize. Surplus food was stored in <b>storage</b> <b>pits</b> and granaries. Care was taken to prevent spoiling or consumption by rodents, such as placing seeds and food in jars and <b>storage</b> <b>pits.</b>|$|R

They had been carefully placed within a large pottery bowl, which had been placed in the ground and covered over with dirt, accounting for their mostly very good state of preservation. The find came as a complete surprise to the archaeologists, who were used to finding small non-precious objects but had not expected to make a major discovery. According to Vrkić, [...] "It was hard to believe that it is silver, because they always find some small things, and when we find something half a meter long ... it was hard to believe that it was silver and it was ancient." ...|$|E

5|$|Early in {{its life}} the site {{consisted}} of a single ditch encompassing an area of about , with two gateways, one in the south-west and another in the east; two more rings of ditches were added later. The north part of the fort was occupied by four-post structures, probably granaries, which were later replaced by <b>storage</b> <b>pits,</b> and in the south part, there were roundhouses in between granaries and <b>storage</b> <b>pits.</b> When Danebury {{was built in the}} 6th century BC, it coincided with the construction of several other hillforts in the Wessex region, all of a similar size and layout.|$|R
50|$|Over 500 {{subterranean}} <b>storage</b> <b>pits</b> {{were discovered}} at Cishan. These pits {{were used to}} store millet. The largest pits were 5 meters deep and capable of storing up to 1000 kg of millet.|$|R

50|$|Māori <b>storage</b> <b>pit</b> sites remain {{clearly visible}} in many place in New Zealand. Pits were dug into soft rock faces {{as well as}} into earth, {{especially}} in Maori Pa (hillforts). Maori storage pits can be confused with fighting pits and also pits which were excavated to extract drainage material, especially on old river terraces where pumice had been deposited. The pumice was mixed with heavier soil to promote drainage for growing kumara (sweet potato), the principal vegetable crop of the Maori after about 1500. The Maori name for a <b>storage</b> <b>pit</b> is rua. An excavation found such storage pits on the sloping banks of the Waikato River below the Waikato Museum in early 2012.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper will}} look at the thirty plus open <b>storage</b> <b>pits</b> located at the high middle age {{basilica}} of Dulantzi (Alegría-Dulantzi, Álava) dating back to the tenth and eleventh centuries. In the first instance we propose to present this little-known site to the scientific community. To do so, different archaeological data gathered during the excavation will be presented involving both the containers (capacity, morphology, location, etc.) as the contents (types of fillings and material found in them). The second aim {{of this paper is to}} contribute towards the historical debate about the presence of <b>storage</b> <b>pits</b> in high middle age churches. To do so, our contribution will follow three different axis. First, the reasons that explain the high number of opened <b>storage</b> <b>pits</b> in Dulantzi. Secondly, its possible connections to the collecthe first instance we propose to present this little-known site tion and storage of ecclesiastical rents. The final question to be looked relates to whether Dulantzi was an exception or on the contrary, is an explanatory model from which we can extrapolate concerning other high middle age sites in the surrounding area...|$|R
50|$|Little Woodbury, 0.5 mi {{southwest}} of the village, {{is the site of}} an Iron Age settlement. Excavations in 1938-39 revealed the sites of granaries, <b>storage</b> <b>pits</b> and a circular house nearly 50 ft in diameter.|$|R
50|$|During {{her initial}} year of operation, Savannah {{released}} over 115,000 gallons of very low-level radioactive waste at sea, having substantially exceeded her storage capacity of 10000 gal L. The Nuclear Servicing Vessel Atomic Servant {{was built to}} receive waste from Savannah. The unpowered barge featured a fuel <b>storage</b> <b>pit</b> for a replacement fuel and control rod assembly, lined by 12 in of lead. Atomic Servant was made available to service Savannah anywhere in the world.|$|E
5000|$|The site {{is located}} on a terrace {{overlooking}} Waterman Creek. [...] It has yielded evidence of occupation for a roughly 300-year period around 1200 CE. The site was completely surrounded by a wooden stockade, probably for protection against other Native Americans. Within the bounds of the stockade there were about 20 lodges, partially subterranean structures about 20 x 30 ft, which were accessed by entry tunnels. Each lodge had a fireplace and a <b>storage</b> <b>pit.</b>|$|E

50|$|It {{appears that}} bitter pit can {{generally}} {{be reduced by}} using good horticultural practices. Usually spraying throughout the growing season with a calcium salt is also necessary for moderately susceptible cultivars. It {{is more difficult to}} control <b>storage</b> <b>pit</b> in highly susceptible cultivars as field spraying {{may not be able to}} apply sufficient calcium to the fruit. Improved control can be obtained by also dipping the fruit in a 2-3 per cent calcium chloride solution after harvest and rinsing the fruit in water after about 36 hours.|$|E
50|$|Technology is {{researched}} {{at specific}} buildings, {{to which they}} are generally related; for example, religious research is done in temples and improved armor is researched in the <b>storage</b> <b>pit.</b> Technological advances come in many categories, such as military upgrades (better arms and armor for units), economic upgrades (increasing the efficiency of resource gathering), religious upgrades (faster conversion rates and more abilities for priests) and infrastructure upgrades (stronger fortifications and more resilient buildings).

50|$|Most of the hearths found, {{along with}} the tripod, were {{associated}} with the habitation structure, which was the largest feature of the site. The tripod that was discovered was not related to any of the hearths so the archeologists speculate that instead of being used for cooking this was used as a type of backrest like those used by historic aboriginal populations. The two pits discovered were not thought to be used for fire. One appeared to be a <b>storage</b> <b>pit</b> and the other an ash pit. 18 hearths were found on many different levels showing different occupations of humans. The hearths consisted of surface hearths and basin hearths, basin hearths being the most common and also the most sophisticated.|$|E
50|$|The {{hill was}} {{partially}} excavated in 1939 and 1947. Ceramic fragments {{dating to the}} Iron Age were recovered, and two infilled <b>storage</b> <b>pits</b> were discovered. Evidence of the medieval occupation of the site was also revealed, including stonework and ceramics. Further remains date from the Tudor period, and include short lengths of wall, packed floors, bricks, tiles, and ovens. A ring-headed pin, fashioned from wire, was recovered {{from one of the}} Iron Age <b>storage</b> <b>pits.</b> The traditional association of the hill as a site of a medieval hunting lodge attributed to King John is supported by documentary evidence that a deer park existed at East Worldham at least as far back as 1372.|$|R
