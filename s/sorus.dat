2500|$|The {{bacteria}} reside {{within these}} phagosomes during the aggregation and the multicellular development stages. The amoebae preserve their individuality and each amoeba {{has its own}} bacterium. During the culmination stage, when the spores are produced, the bacteria pass from the cell to the <b>sorus</b> {{with the help of}} a cytoskeletal structure that prevents host cell destruction. Some results suggest the bacteria exploit the exocytosis without killing the cell.|$|E
2500|$|Pinnae of {{the fertile}} fronds carry {{from one to}} twelve pairs of sori on their underside, each [...] long. Each pair of sori forms a chevron, {{pointing}} towards {{the base of the}} pinna along its central axis. An indusium covers each sorus; these are whitish and translucent or silvery with a slightly toothed or erose (irregularly jagged) edge, soon withering to reveal the sori. Each sporangium in a <b>sorus</b> carries 64spores. The diploid sporophyte has a chromosome number of 72.|$|E

2500|$|Plant disease {{resistance}} {{is the result}} of coevolution between the plant and pathogen. During Ustilago scitaminea infection, the fungus grows within the meristematic tissue and induces formation of flowering structures, which it colonises to produce its teliopores. The flowering structures, usually typical grass panicles, are transformed into a whip-like <b>sorus</b> that grows rapidly and protrudes out between the leaf sheaths. The development of sugarcane smut depends on the interaction among environment, the sugarcane variety and the pathogen itself. If the interaction between smut-resistant varieties and the pathogen is nonaffinity, {{disease resistance}} occurs; however, if the interaction between smut-susceptible varieties and the pathogen is affinity, disease susceptibility occurs. A series of physiological and biochemical changes, together with the molecular response, occur during the period between the appearance of the stress on plant from the invasion of the pathogen and the subsequent plant-pathogen interaction. Progress has been made in studies of the molecular basis of sugarcane smut resistance. [...] According to one study, the type of resistance is a single gene resistance [...] at the N52/219 gene site. [...] Furthermore this study talked about several different strains or races of Ustilago scitaminea. [...] Despite what has been learned, more studies on the molecular interaction in this pathosystem are needed to discover the mechanisms of smut resistance.|$|E
2500|$|Sugarcane smut is disseminated via teliospores {{that are}} {{produced}} in the smut whip. These teliospores located either in the soil or on the plant, germinate {{in the presence of}} water. [...] After germination they produce promycelium and undergo meiosis to create four haploid sporidia. Sugarcane smut is bipolar and therefore produces two different mating types of sporida. [...] For infection to occur, two sporida from different mating types must come together and form a dikaryon. [...] This dikaryon then produces hyphae that penetrate the bud scales of the sugarcane [...] plant and infect the meristematic tissue. [...] The fungus grows within the meristematic tissue and induces formation of flowering structures which it colonises to produce its teliopores. The flowering structures, usually typical grass arrows, are transformed into a whip like <b>sorus</b> that grows out between the leaf sheaths. At first it is covered by a thin silvery peridium (this is the host tissue) which easily peels back when desiccated to expose the sooty black-brown teliospores. [...] These teliospores are then dispersed via wind and the cycle continues. The spores are reddish brown, round and subovoid and may be smooth to moderately echinulate. The size varies from 6.5 to 8um. Sugarcane cultivars intended for distribution to other geographical areas should be tested for susceptibility to S. scitamineum populations in each area.|$|E

50|$|These ferns {{are called}} leptosporangiate because their sporangia arise {{from a single}} {{epidermal}} cell and not {{from a group of}} cells as in eusporangiate ferns (a polyphyletic lineage). The sporangia are typically covered with a scale called the indusium, which can cover the whole <b>sorus,</b> forming a ring or cup around the <b>sorus,</b> or can also be strongly reduced to completely absent. Many leptosporangiate ferns have an annulus around the sporangium, which ejects the spores.|$|E
50|$|Species in {{this group}} are short cycled. The {{zoospore}} nucleus forms a <b>sorus.</b> Resting spores are either unknown or truly absent.|$|E

50|$|Fern fronds often bear sporangia, {{where the}} plant's spores are formed, usually on the {{underside}} (abaxial surface) of the pinnae, but sometimes marginally or scattered over the frond. The sporangia are typically clustered into a <b>sorus</b> (pl., sori). Associated with each <b>sorus</b> in many species is a membranous protective structure called an indusium, which is {{an outgrowth of the}} blade surface that may partly cover the sporangia. Some fern species feature frond dimorphism, in which fertile and sterile fronds differ in appearance and structure.|$|E
50|$|In fungi and lichens, the <b>sorus</b> is {{surrounded}} by an external layer. In some red algae it may {{take the form of}} a depression into the thallus.|$|E
50|$|Sori or spore-producing organs {{occur in}} a row down {{each side of the}} midrib. The indusium of the <b>sorus</b> is irregularly toothed and edged with sessile glands.|$|E
50|$|A <b>sorus</b> (pl. sori) is {{a cluster}} of sporangia (structures {{producing}} and containing spores) in ferns and fungi. This New Latin word is from Ancient Greek σωρός (sōrós ‘stack, pile, heap’).|$|E
50|$|Members of {{the genus}} bear a single <b>sorus</b> on each pinna of the divided leaf blade. The edges of the pinnae are rolled back towards their tips and cover the sori.|$|E

The cabin boy aboard Trumpet, Ciro Vasaczk, is captured by <b>Sorus</b> and blackmailed into sabotaging the drive of Trumpet using the same mutagens. Calm Horizons attempts to destroy Trumpet to prevent the broadcasting of the mutagen drug formula, but is engaged by the UMCP ship Punisher and, due to the turning of Soar against Calm Horizons, is unable to destroy either Punisher or Trumpet, though Soar is destroyed. The book ends with Calm Horizons speeding for Earth.|$|E
50|$|At one time, all thelypterioid ferns were {{included}} in the genus Dryopteris because of the <b>sorus</b> shape. However, there are a great many differences between the groups, and these plants are now segregated in their own family.|$|E
5000|$|A sorocarp (from the Greek word soros [...] "a heap" [...] + karpos [...] "fruit") is the fruiting body {{characteristic}} of certain cellular slime moulds (e.g., Dictyosteliida). Each sorocarp consists {{of both a}} sorophore (stalk) and a <b>sorus.</b>|$|E
50|$|In biology, {{the meeting}} of the two valves of a brachiopod or clam is a commissure; in botany, the term is used to denote the place where a fern's {{laterally}} expanded vein endings come together in a continuous marginal <b>sorus.</b>|$|E

50|$|Members of Synchytrium are endobiotic, holocarpic, and inoperculate. This means Synchytrium species grow {{inside of}} the host cell (endobiotic), produce {{structures}} other than a zoosporangium (holocarpic), and do not release zoospores through a lid-like structure (inoperculate). Zoospores of other members of Chytridiomycota typically give rise to one zoosorangium or a polycentric thallus capable of producing many zoosporangia. In Synchytrium, the zoospore nucleus divides many times with each daughter nucleus giving rise to a zoosporangium. This produces a cluster of clonal zoosporangia, often enveloped with a membrane. This cluster is called a <b>sorus.</b> The zoospore can give rise to the <b>sorus</b> directly or it {{can act as a}} prosorus. The difference is demonstrated in the life cycle, which is discussed below.|$|E
50|$|Sori, the spore-producing {{organs are}} formed along {{the margins of}} the frond segments. The indusium forms a funnel around the <b>sorus</b> which is sunken in the leaf tissue. A bristle-like {{receptacle}} protrudes from the indusium as in all Trichomanes species. Spore production occurs between July and September.|$|E
50|$|Seen {{between one}} and seven metres tall, it may be {{identified}} by the thin, prickly trunk, 5 to 15 cm wide. The sori lack true indusia, {{the base of the}} <b>sorus</b> bears a ring of scales. Fronds are up to 3 metres long, and the stipe is around 20 cm in length.|$|E
50|$|The second Faramaz-nama is a known book in 464 {{pages and}} {{containing}} between nine and ten thousand distichs.

50|$|Plants {{with common}} bunt may be {{moderately}} stunted but infected plants cannot be easily recognized until near maturity {{and even then}} it is seldom conspicuous. After initial infection, the entire kernel is converted into a <b>sorus</b> consisting of a dark brown to black mass of teliospores covered by a modified periderm, which is thin and papery. The <b>sorus</b> is light to dark brown and is called a bunt ball. The bunt balls resemble wheat kernels but {{tend to be more}} spherical. The bunted heads are slender, bluish-green and may stay greener longer than healthy heads. The bunt balls change to a dull gray-brown at maturity, at which they become conspicuous. The fragile covering of the bunt balls are ruptured at harvest, producing clouds of spores. The spores have a fishy odor. Intact sori can also be found among harvested grain.|$|E
50|$|When Trumpet {{arrives at}} Beckmann’s lab they {{discover}} that the ship that was pursuing them had guessed where they might go and has already arrived.

50|$|Nick {{contacts}} Captain's Fancy and instructs Liete Corregio, {{his third}} in command, {{to attack the}} ship called Soar, as Nick has discovered that it is captained by <b>Sorus</b> Chatelaine, a woman who seduced, betrayed and abandoned Nick as a young man, but not before leaving the streaked scars underneath his eyes that act as his emotional barometer.|$|E
50|$|Several stages {{occur in}} its lifecycle. The feeding form has a stiff, rounded body with {{cellular}} extensions used in feeding. Cells can transform into mobile flagellated cells with stiff tripartite hairs {{typical of the}} Stramenopiles. Cells can also grow and divide to form a cluster of cells which may become a <b>sorus</b> that produces biflagellated zoospores.|$|E
5000|$|Among ferns, sporocarps {{are found}} only in the three {{families}} of the order Salviniales, {{a group that is}} both aquatic and heterosporous. The term actually refers to two very different structures. In the Azollaceae and Salviniaceae, the sporocarp {{is nothing more than a}} modified <b>sorus,</b> a single cluster of spore-producing tissues enclosed by a thin sphere of tissue and attached to the leaves.|$|E
50|$|This {{subgenus}} {{is referred}} to as Synchytrium or Eusynchytrium. Species in this group do not form prosori. The <b>sorus</b> forms directly from the zoospore nucleus. Several generations can be produced during the spring and summer. Resting spores are developed in the fall and winter. Upon germination, the resting spore acts as a sporangium. The type, Synchytrium taraxci, is placed in this subgenus.|$|E
