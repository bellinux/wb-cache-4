5|$|The {{number of}} subplots {{on the show}} grew as more cast members were added. Regular subplots since the 1980s included: Howard and Marina trying to have an affair without Howard's wife finding out (a {{variation}} of the Wainwright-Partridge subplot of the 1970s), the older women meeting for tea and discussing their theories about men and life, Auntie Wainwright trying to sell unwanted merchandise to unsuspecting customers, Smiler {{trying to find a}} woman, Barry trying to better himself (at the insistence of Glenda), and Tom trying to stay one <b>step</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> the repo man.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the other}} Gangers have regrouped, led by Ganger Cleaves. She realizes {{that she is}} {{suffering}} from the same terminal illness that the human Cleaves is suffering, and questions their need to kill their counterparts. The group is spurred on by Ganger Jennifer who insists the humans must die. As Ganger Cleaves orders her group to stay one <b>step</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> the humans, the Ganger Jennifer kills the real Jennifer, and then stages a fight with another Ganger Jennifer to fool Rory {{that she is the}} human version. Ganger Jennifer leads Rory to a console, claiming it will restore power when instead it disables the cooling system for the acid, making it dangerously unstable. She then convinces Rory to lead the human group into the acid storage chamber and traps them inside; crewman Jimmy is killed trying to stall the acid release.|$|E
5|$|In the 1998 storyline {{where he}} fakes dissociative {{identity}} disorder (split personalities) to avoid a prison sentence for hostage and threat charges, he is given four personalities that represent his core being: A childlike personality named Tom, Italian playboy Rod, parental figure Miss Perkins, and the abusive Pete (the personality responsible for his worst misdeeds). The revelation that he is faking the personalities devastates Viki, who had actually suffered from the disorder; it also brings out remorse in Todd, and causes him to reflect on his mistakes. The storyline ends with the implication that the personalities {{may not have been}} as fabricated as Todd believed them to be. The writers also made it so that his difficulties are manifested in his nightmares, which give him insomnia and are designed as a look into his psyche; at multiple points within the series, Téa attempts to help Todd by encouraging him to open up to her about them, which he eventually does. His opinions on his enemies are conveyed clearly; he remains one <b>step</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> them, and consistently out-smarts police, family, and others he targets, sometimes using weapons.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{benefits}} {{being a member of}} the school's JTC and Combined Cadet Force was that Derby School pupils were allowed to undertake Cert.'A' training in all military matters and in Derby this meant that final exams were held at The Barracks at Sinfin in Derby, the home of the Sherwood Foresters Regiment.

25|$|After {{driving to}} midfield, the Chargers faced third and 10 with 2:08 remaining. Buffalo sent safety Steve Freeman on a blitz {{for the next}} play, leaving Smith, San Diego's No. 3 receiver, one on one with Simpson. Earlier in the game, Simpson had knocked {{the ball out of}} Smith's hands during a catch attempt and then picked it off in mid air. But this time, Smith managed to get one <b>step</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> Simpson, make the catch, and evade his desperate diving tackle attempt, leaving Simpson face down on the turf as he raced 50 yards for a touchdown. Edwards sealed the victory for the Chargers after the ensuing kickoff by {{recording}} his second interception from Ferguson with 1:16 left in the game.|$|E
25|$|Public opinion {{pressured}} the U.S. government to bring Villa to {{justice for the}} raid on Columbus, New Mexico; U.S. President Wilson sent Gen. John J. Pershing and some 5,000 troops into Mexico in an unsuccessful attempt to capture Villa. It {{was known as the}} Punitive Expedition. After nearly a year of pursuing Villa, American forces returned to the United States. The American intervention had been limited to the western sierras of Chihuahua. Villa had the advantage of intimately knowing the inhospitable terrain of the Sonoran Desert and the almost impassable Sierra Madre mountains and always managed to stay one <b>step</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> his pursuers. In 1923 Villa was assassinated by a group of seven gunmen who ambushed him while he was sitting {{in the back seat of}} his car in Parral.|$|E
25|$|During the 1970s, Googoosh began a {{meteoric}} rise to {{fame and}} success {{as she drove}} the edge of Iranian pop music further and further. Known for her flamboyant outfits and fashion sense, Googoosh wowed her pop culture hungry fans in Iran and abroad with her trademark hairdos and hip-elegant style. Iranian women changed hairdos with Googoosh and she was always one <b>step</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> them with a new look. Her music ranged from upbeat 1960s and 1970s pop, given an Arabic-tinged edge, to declamatory, emotional ballads dealing with love and loss, which at times edged towards chanson and Édith Piaf territory. She starred in over 25 movies, {{one of which was}} to be the most commercially successful Iranian motion picture of all time. Googoosh performed many times for the royal family and was a favorite of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's wife and children. She performed at the party given for the 1977 birthday of Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran.|$|E

25|$|As noted, a {{few months}} after his {{appointment}} as ABA President Ehnat was fired by the ABA under bad circumstances and was replaced by the new ABA management by Clayton John, a former motorcycle racer and BMX track operator and who is still the current (2006) ABA President. Ehnat became Vice President of the USBA and became active in the campaign to shore up the image of the USBA which was beginning to take damaging hits in the BMX industry, including its dealings with disgraced BMX promoter Renny Roker. Bob Hadley*, team manager of the Huffy BMX team noticed at one time that Erhart was pretty prescient in questions he had with him even before he mentioned them. At the time only Clayton John was privy to the specific concerns in a letter Mr. Hadley had that he had shared only with Mr. John at the time. The timing of Ehnat responses {{and the fact that the}} USBA seemed to always be one <b>step</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> the ABA in court actions was so uncanny Mr. Hadley joked that someone must have bugged Mr. John's office. Clayton John took the whimsical joke seriously and had ABA headquarters swept for bugs by experts in counter surveillance and corporate espionage. After the sweep, two experts, one a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agent and the other a former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent found evidence of tampering in one of the telephone trunk lines leading to Mr. John's office. The lines were stripped in a way that it was evidence that a telephone tap was in place at some time. No conclusive proof only circumstantial evidence has suggested that the USBA was responsible. Another suspect, the IRS could have done it given the pressure they put the ABA under, including showing up during ABA nationals but aside from it being illegal without a court order, the IRS had perfectly legal ways available to them to get once sensitive information about the ABA, including financial assets. Most of it was public record particularly court proceedings. The IRS had no real motive to go through the unnecessary risk of wire-tapping the ABA offices.|$|E

Although Mr. Jackson drives the unwanted intruders away, he leaves behind a mess of honey smears, moss, thistledown, and dirty footprints that Mrs. Tittlemouse invests two weeks of her life into cleaning up.|$|E
500|$|Harrison's musical biographer, Simon Leng, views [...] "Dark Horse" [...] as its {{composer}} addressing {{his critics}} {{by creating a}} [...] "new persona".

Commentators try to pin his character down at peril, for {{he is likely to}} change and take the least expected course." [...] In the song's choruses, Harrison declares himself [...] "a dark horse / Running on a dark race course", [...] "a blue moon", and a [...] "cool jerk" [...] who is [...] "Looking for the source".

500|$|The {{episode title}} is a {{reference}} to the standard of the Roman legion, a symbol that represents the legion's unity.

500|$|The {{season is}} {{structured}} into three [...] "pods" [...] {{based on its}} airing schedule: the first eight episodes, subtitled Ghost Rider; LMD (Life Model Decoy) for the subsequent seven episodes; and a third pod for the final seven episodes called Agents of Hydra. Elements and characters cross over between the different pods, but the sections [...] "definitely have a different feel" [...] from one another, as Tancharoen explained that 22 episodes [...] "is {{a long time to}} hold a big bad or a single plot line, especially for an audience", and for the past two seasons, the series was able to have two separated halves that [...] "allows us to introduce a big bad. And then, something happens and we rise somebody new ... Now, there's three of those." [...] "Financial considerations" [...] were also taken into account in creating the pods for the season, as using LMDs does not [...] "cost as much as setting a guy's head on fire via CGI". In terms of writing the [...] "complicated season", Whedon said the writers were [...] "aware that our fans are our fans and have spent some time with these characters and are clever and see things coming sometimes ... Part of our job is to create not just what we are presenting on plot, but letting the audience be one <b>step</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> us and being one <b>step</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> that." [...] He added that the writers knew that they wanted to tell a Ghost Rider story, an LMD story, and a [...] "what if" [...] scenario, and the hardest part was making each pod still fit together as a single season. The major connection ultimately became the Darkhold, which leads from the magic of Ghost Rider to the advanced science of LMD and then the Framework in Agents of Hydra. Ghost Rider also reappears in the final episode of the season, [...] "World's End", as an additional connection.|$|E

500|$|Screen Rant {{wrote of}} the character: [...] "Rather than {{beginning}} the series {{in a state of}} potential heroism, Alex begins the series as a potential villain. And yet, Alex is still a hero. Everything that follows is a desperate attempt at survival and at remaining one <b>step</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> those who are trying to harm her. In fact, Alex's narrative is one in which she is nearly immediately immersed in adventure and thrown headfirst into chaos." [...] The character is also opinionated and outspoken. Chopra said [...] "Alex is someone with a point of a view and she's a woman with an opinion {{and at the same time}} she's not afraid of being who she is. The modern woman today is different and Alex is definitely bold and expressive and she identifies herself as a human being of today, not a man or a woman. She's empowered and she's confident." ...|$|E
