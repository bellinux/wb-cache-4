40|$|The low {{emissions}} {{potential of}} a Rich-Quench-Lean (RQL) combustor {{for use in the}} High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) application was evaluated as part of Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) 1. 0. 2. 7 of the NASA Critical Propulsion Components (CPC) Program under Contract NAS 3 - 27235. Combustion testing was conducted in cell 1 E of the Jet Burner Test Stand at United Technologies Research Center. Specifically, a Rich-Quench-Lean combustor, utilizing reduced scale quench technology implemented in a quench vane concept in a product-like configuration (Product Module Rig), demonstrated the capability of achieving an emissions index of nitrogen oxides (NOx EI) of 8. 5 gm/Kg fuel at the supersonic flight condition (relative to the program goal of 5 gm/Kg fuel). Developmental parametric testing of various quench vane configurations in the more fundamental flametube, <b>Single</b> Module <b>Rig</b> Configuration, demonstrated NOx EI as low as 5. 2. All configurations in both the Product Module Rig configuration and the <b>Single</b> Module <b>Rig</b> configuration demonstrated exceptional efficiencies, greater than 99. 95 percent, relative to the program goal of 99. 9 percent efficiency at supersonic cruise conditions. Sensitivity of emissions to quench orifice design parameters were determined during the parametric quench vane test series in support of the design of the Product Module Rig configuration. For the rectangular quench orifices investigated, an aspect ratio (length/width) of approximately 2 was found to be near optimum. An optimum for orifice spacing was found to exist at approximately 0. 167 inches, resulting in 24 orifices per side of a quench vane, for the 0. 435 inch quench zone channel height investigated in the <b>Single</b> Module <b>Rig.</b> Smaller quench zone channel heights appeared to be beneficial in reducing emissions. Measurements were also obtained in the <b>Single</b> Module <b>Rig</b> configuration on the sensitivity of emissions to the critical combustor parameters of fuel/air ratio, pressure drop, and residence time. Minimal sensitivity was observed for all of these parameters...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a general feasibility study on double <b>rigged</b> versus <b>single</b> <b>rigged</b> trawls. This study used model experimental nets {{tested in a}} circulating water tank. Three kinds of trawls were tested, i. e. the Mexican semi ballon double rigged shrimp trawl designed by Nichimo (hereafter called net A), the traditional two seam <b>single</b> <b>rigged</b> Malaysian shrimp trawl (net B) and the four seam trawl modified from the above Malaysian trawl (net C). The head rope length of net A is about half that of net B and net C. Primary objectives are to determine physical characteristics, working performance and to estimate the main engine output necessary to pull these nets. To provide a double rigged shrimp trawl in the Malaysian shrimp fisheries, results of experiments are summarised as follows: 1) At 2 knots, which is a normal towing speed of a Malaysian shrimp trawler, net mouth height of net A is 1. 2 meter, net B is 2 meter and net C is 1. 8 meter. In accordance to the behaviour of shrimp, these net mouth height are sufficient. 2) In order to ensure {{the security of the}} catch, the most efficient average mesh opening was determined to be five vertical cross-sections. The mesh opening is bigger at the square panel and becomes smaller towards the cod end. The opening is about 3 centimeter for 5. 7 centimeter mesh size. 3) The wing tip spread of net A is 11 meter, which is 80 % of its head rope length. Net B is 14 meter (55 %) and net C is 14. 4 meter (60 %). 4) The working performance of a shrimp trawl is determined by its sweeping area. The obtained experimental equations of the sweeping area of the three net are slimplified as follows: 2 net A: A's= 2. 18 Vnet B: A"s= 1. 57 Vnet C: A‴s= 1. 58 V 5) The estimation of suitable main engine output necessary to pull the net is calculated from the conversion of total gear drag force values to horse power values. Equations of the above power of the three nets are: 2 net A: EHP'= 12. 19 V^ net B: EHP"= 11. 01 V^ net C: EHP‴= 10. 89 V< 2. 61...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{concentrates}} {{on hands and}} their production as concerns a larger-scale pipeline with multiple secondary or tertiary characters. It establishes a platform from which many unique hands can be produced from a <b>single,</b> <b>rigged</b> hand. Emphasis is given to automating {{a large amount of}} the rigging and sculpting processes through use of high and low-level user interfaces so users of varying skill can use this thesis effectively. Systems for sculpting the hand and animating the hand are created for their own specific purposes and linked together through the interface to create a tool for modeling a new hand from an existing mesh, having the new hand automatically rigged for animation and ready to use with only minor adjustments by the user. A system is developed conclusively that allows for the efficient mass production of tertiary character assets. Unique hands are quickly and correctly created with the ability to connect them to digital characters. This method can be applied not only to hands, but other parts of characters as well. Eventually full secondary or tertiary characters can be created using this method of production...|$|R

40|$|Component bench {{tests are}} {{a crucial part}} of a {{tribology}} assessment experimental programme for most engines and subsystems. This is because they test the components under conditions simulating the operating characteristics of the system. These have become very important as they shed more light into the friction, wear, lubrication and importantly for this study, the tribochemistry of valve train systems. This work outlines the procedure {{for the development of a}} <b>single</b> cam <b>rig</b> (SCR) from a 1. 25 L FORD Zetec (SE) engine.

The tribofilm formed using normal and mid Sulphated Ash, Phosphorus and Sulphur (SAPS) 5 W- 30 oils were evaluated and correlated to the friction and wear properties of the tribopair. Raman and FIB-SEM/EDX investigations of the tribochemical films showed that the normal SAPS oil produced patchy, thick (80 - 100. nm) and well dispersed tribofilm with better wear prevention capabilities. It was observed that Mid SAPS oil had lower wear prevention due to loosely dispersed and thin tribofilms. Absence of tribofilms at the centre of the insert with this oil also suggests that formation and removal processes are an integral part of the wear mechanisms in highly loaded cam follower systems...|$|R

40|$|For {{lean burn}} {{combustor}} development in low emission aero-engines, the pilot {{stage of the}} fuel injector {{plays a key role}} with respect to stability, operability, NOx emissions, and smoke production. Therefore it is of considerable interest to characterize the pilot module in terms of pilot zone mixing, fuel placement, flow field and interaction with the main stage. This contribution focusses on the investigation of soot formation during pilot-only operation. Optical test methods were applied in an optically accessible <b>single</b> sector <b>rig</b> at engine idle conditions. Using planar laser-induced incandescence (LII), the distribution of soot and its dependence on air/fuel ratio, as well as geometric injector parameters, was studied. The data shows that below a certain air/fuel ratio, an increase of soot production occurs. This is in agreement with smoke number measurements in a standard single sector flame tube rig without optical access. Reaction zones were identified using chemiluminescence of OH radicals. In addition, the injector flow field was investigated with PIV. A hypothesis regarding the mechanism of pilot smoke formation was made based on these findings. This along with further investigations will form the basis for developing strategies for smoke improvement at elevated pilot only conditions...|$|R
