50|$|The {{descendants}} of the 8088 include the 80188, 80186, 80286, 80386, 80486, and later <b>software-compatible</b> processors, which are in use today.|$|E
5000|$|Replica 1: Created by Vince Briel. A <b>software-compatible</b> clone, {{produced}} using modern components, {{released in}} 2003 {{at a price}} of around $200.|$|E
50|$|<b>Software-compatible</b> {{devices are}} devices which {{are able to}} run the same {{software}} to produce the same results without the software having to be modified first.|$|E
50|$|Several Maximite clones were {{designed}} and {{released in the}} months following its introduction. Some, such as the Maximite SM1, and Geoff Graham's latest version, the Mini-Maximite, are hardware- and <b>software-compatible</b> with the original design, but use a different form factor.|$|E
50|$|The VC 4000 is {{an early}} 8-bit cartridge-based home video game console {{released}} in Germany in 1978 by Interton. The console is quite obscure outside Germany, but a myriad of <b>software-compatible</b> systems {{can be found in}} numerous European countries (see 1292 Advanced Programmable Video System).|$|E
5000|$|In November 2006, Marvell Semiconductor officially {{introduced}} the Monahans family as Marvell PXA320, PXA300, and PXA310. PXA320 is currently shipping in high volume, and is scalable up to 806 MHz. PXA300 and PXA310 deliver performance [...] "scalable to 624 MHz", and are <b>software-compatible</b> with PXA320.|$|E
50|$|It {{provided}} only {{floppy disk}} and Centronics parallel interfaces, plus a non-maskable interrupt button. The +D's casing was simple folded steel, {{which was not}} only stronger than before but acted as a heatsink, improving reliability. Apart from the missing ports, though, it was <b>software-compatible</b> with the larger device.|$|E
50|$|PowerQUICC {{will cease}} {{development}} {{in favor of}} the <b>software-compatible</b> QorIQ platform featuring all PowerPC e500 based processors, from single core, through multi-core, up to 32 cores. Freescale will keep manufacturing PowerQUICC processors in the foreseeable future for existing customers, but they will help facilitate the transition to QorIQ.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2015, Udo Möller {{released}} a complete Verilog implementation of an NS32000 processor on OpenCores. [...] Fully <b>software-compatible</b> with an NS32532 CPU with N32381 FPU, it is significantly faster when implemented on an FPGA, both operating {{at a higher}} clock rate and using fewer cycles per instruction.|$|E
50|$|The 1292 Advanced Programmable Video System is a {{home video}} game console {{released}} by European company Audiosonic in 1978. It {{is part of a}} group of <b>software-compatible</b> consoles which include the Interton VC-4000 and the Voltmace Database. The 1292 Advanced Programmable Video System included its power pack inside the console instead of an exterior power pack.|$|E
5000|$|The Elliott 503 was a {{transistorized}} computer {{introduced by}} Elliott Brothers in 1963. It was <b>software-compatible</b> {{with the earlier}} Elliott 803 but was about 70 times faster and a more powerful machine. About 32 units were sold. The basic configuration had 8192 words of 39 bits each for main memory, and operated at a system clock speed of 6.7 megahertz.|$|E
50|$|The console was {{produced}} by different companies and sold with different names. Not every console is compatible with others {{due to differences in}} the shapes and dimensions of the cartridge slots, but all of the systems are software compatible.In the article about the 1292 Advanced Programmable Video System there is a table with all the <b>software-compatible</b> consoles grouped by compatibility family (due to the slots).|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} specification, {{created by}} AMD and released in 2000, has been implemented by AMD, Intel and VIA. The AMD K8 processor {{was the first}} to implement the architecture; this was the first significant addition to the x86 architecture designed by a company other than Intel. Intel was forced to follow suit and introduced a modified NetBurst family which was fully <b>software-compatible</b> with AMD's design and specification. VIA Technologies introduced x86-64 in their VIA Isaiah architecture, with the VIA Nano.|$|E
50|$|The Psion Revo, {{launched}} in November 1999, is a PDA from Psion. It is {{the successor to}} the Psion Series 3 and a light version of Psion 5mx. It is <b>software-compatible</b> with the 5mx and has the same processor but is more lightweight (200 g vs 354 g of 5mx) and substantially smaller (157 × 79 × 17 mm). In comparison with the Series 5/5mx, the Revo has a smaller screen (480 × 160 vs 640 × 240 of Series 5/5mx) and also lacks a flash-card slot and a backlight.|$|E
50|$|The LPC bus was {{introduced}} by Intel in 1998 as a <b>software-compatible</b> substitute for the Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus. It resembles ISA to software, although physically it is quite different. The ISA bus has a 16-bit data bus and a 24-bit address bus {{that can be used}} for both 16-bit I/O port addresses and 24-bit memory addresses; both run at speeds up to 8.33 MHz. The LPC bus uses a heavily multiplexed four-bit-wide bus operating at four times the clock speed (33.3 MHz) to transfer addresses and data with similar performance.|$|E
5000|$|The M16C MCU {{platform}} of products offers you {{a variety of}} choices, spanning entry-level capabilities and pricing previously associated with 8-bit MCUs; hitting many options of pin-count, RAM and ROM choices; and reaching into the high-speed processing of 32-bit MCUs — all with MCUs that are upwardly pin- and <b>software-compatible.</b> For communications these chip have optional clock synchronous/asynchronous shared (max 5 channels), IEBus (max 5 channels), I2C bus (max 5 channels), CAN 2.0B (max 2 channels). The only group in this family which {{does not have the}} IEBus functionality available is, the M16C/70 group. link ...|$|E
5000|$|KDF8 was {{an early}} British {{computer}} built by English Electric as {{a version of the}} RCA 501. By producing a <b>software-compatible</b> system, the intention was to reduce time and cost to develop software. However, the lengthy process of developing manufacturing capability meant that the system was soon outpaced by systems from other vendors. Only a few systems were sold during its 5 years of production. Due to the consolidation of the British computer industry, English Electric's computer division became one of the components of what would become ICL.|$|E
50|$|Two {{types of}} video game console used the Signetics 2650 or 2650A. The {{first group of}} {{consoles}} {{are based on the}} video display controller 2636 Programmable Video Interface; the 1292 Advanced Programmable Video System and the closely related Interton VC4000 belong to this group. Those were released in Germany in 1976 and 1978 respectively. The second group of consoles were based on the Signetics 2637 as a video display controller; Emerson Arcadia 2001 which was released in 1982 and which used a Signetics 2650 running at 3.58 MHz as a CPU belong to this group together with many other ones <b>software-compatible</b> (Leonardo, Hanimex MPT-03 etc.).|$|E
5000|$|It {{came out}} as the clear winner against other {{standards}} such as Protek and AGF's cursor-based solution and the Fuller standard during {{the days of the}} 48K Spectrum. However, when Amstrad released the ZX Spectrum +2, the computer featured a built-in joystick interface that was <b>software-compatible</b> with Sinclair's ZX Interface 2 standard. Unfortunately, the bundled SJS-1 joystick was electrically incompatible with the Atari standard. The Interface 2 standard simulated keypresses on the numerical keys ( [...] to [...] and [...] to [...] being left, right, down, up, fire for the 'left' and 'right' joysticks respectively) and hence were ideal for games with no official joystick support but in which the keys could be redefined.|$|E
50|$|The same VDP {{is used in}} the MSX and ColecoVision machines. Further upgrade chips, the 9938 and 9958, were {{produced}} by Yamaha based on TI's design. Boards were created that took advantage of these new chips to upgrade the graphics capabilities of the TI-99/4A. The 9938, the more common of the two upgrades, allow 512 × 424 pixels at 16 colours, or 256 × 424 at 256 colours. These upgrades are not a simple drop-in and replace; a small board including the replacement VDP and replacement VDP RAM (usually 128kB) is required. In addition, although the chips were largely <b>software-compatible,</b> certain bugs in the ROMs cause compatibility issues with the new chips. One board, the Mechatronic 80-column card featuring the 9938 require that the user press a button when entering TI BASIC.|$|E
5000|$|IBM {{at first}} asked {{developers}} to avoid writing software that addressed the computer's hardware directly, and to instead make standard calls to BIOS functions that carried out hardware-dependent operations. This software would run on any machine using MS-DOS or PC-DOS. Software that directly addressed the hardware {{instead of making}} standard calls was faster, however; this was particularly relevant to games. Software addressing IBM PC hardware in this way would not run on MS-DOS machines with different hardware. The IBM PC was sold in high enough volumes to justify writing software specifically for it, and this encouraged other manufacturers to produce machines which could use the same programs, expansion cards, and peripherals as the PC. The 808x computer marketplace rapidly excluded all machines which were not hardware- and <b>software-compatible</b> with the PC. The 640 KB barrier on [...] "conventional" [...] system memory available to MS-DOS is a legacy of that period; other non-clone machines, while subject to a limit, could exceed 640 kB.|$|E
5000|$|After {{designing}} {{their own}} fully functional {{replacement for the}} TRS-80 expansion interface (which was never commercialized) the company realized {{that they could do}} better than just re-designing the expansion interface. They observed that the TRS-80 was a great computer but it lacked in several areas. The display logic and resulting display 'snow' was irritating, as was the missing lower case support, the CPU speed could be improved, the quality and layout of the keyboard was bothersome, and the floppy disk capacity and reliability was low. Also the more interesting software offered for CP/M systems could not run well on a TRS-80. So they decided to design a TRS-80 and CP/M <b>software-compatible</b> computer system, which (following the lead of Apple Computer) they decided to name after a [...] "typical Dutch flower". So they called it the Aster CT-80 (CP/M/Tandy-1980). Why they went with Aster, and not the more well known Tulip is unknown, perhaps they thought it would be to presumptuous, or perhaps the fact that [...] "Aster" [...] is also a Dutch girls' name {{has something to do with}} it. Remarkably [...] "Aster" [...] was also the name given to a Dutch Supercomputer much later, in 2002.|$|E
5000|$|On 29 September 2014, FTDI {{released}} {{an updated version}} of their USB-to-Serial driver for Windows on their website. [...] Users who manually downloaded the new drivers reported problems. After Windows drivers became available on 14 October (Patch Tuesday) via Windows Update, it was reported by users of hardware enthusiast forums and websites that the drivers could soft brick counterfeit and <b>software-compatible</b> clones of the chips by changing their USB [...] "Product ID" [...] to [...] "0000". The change prevents the chip from being recognized by drivers of any OS, effectively making them inoperable unless the product ID is changed back. The behaviour was supported by a notice in the drivers' end user license agreement, which warned that use of the drivers with non-genuine FTDI products would [...] "irretrievably damage" [...] them. Critics felt that FTDI's actions were unethical, considering that users may be unaware that their chips were counterfeit, or that Windows had automatically installed a driver meant to disable them. On 22 October 2014, an emergency patch was made to the FTDI drivers in the Linux kernel to recognize devices with the [...] "0000" [...] ID.|$|E
40|$|The Kinetis MCU {{portfolio}} {{consists of}} multiple pin-, peripheral- and <b>software-compatible</b> MCU families {{based on the}} ARM ® Cortex™-M 4 core.
