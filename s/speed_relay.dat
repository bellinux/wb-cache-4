40|$|An ultra high <b>speed</b> <b>relay</b> for the {{protection}} of long EBY transmission lines is described in this thesis. The need for ultra high speed relays is first discussed. From a brief review of protection based on "impedance" distance algorithms or methods using post fault transients, it is shown that at present, there is no truly ultra high <b>speed</b> <b>relay</b> available for {{the protection}} of long EBY transmission lines. The proposed relay operates on the incident fault transient travelling waves received at the relaying point only. After the arrival of the first incident transient at the relaying point all subsequent incident travelling waves are detected using the cross-correlation of the first reflected wave with the incident transient waves. From the amplitudes of the subsequent incident transients, two fault resistance estimates are obtained. These two fault resistance estimates are in agreement only for the subsequent incident wave which is caused by direct reflection from the fault. The fault location can then be determined from the time of arrival of this wave. Additional checks based on the ground mode delay or the line round trip wave amplitude, are incorporated to enhance further the security of the scheme. Good fault discrimination is shown to be possible over a large range of fault resistances for symmetric three phase faults to ground, phase to ground faults and phase to phase faults. Double circuit transmission lines and compensated transmission lines can also be protected. The relay has good noise tolerance and a reasonable bandwidth requirement. A real time implementation of the basic algorithm for an internal phase-a to ground fault shows that an ultra high <b>speed</b> <b>relay</b> response with good accuracy can be achieved using currently available digital hardware...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn short track <b>speed</b> skating, the <b>relay</b> {{exchange}} {{provides an}} additional strategic component to races by allowing {{a team to}} change the skater involved in the pack race. It is thought that {{during this period of}} the race, time can be gained or lost due to the execution of the relay exchange. However, the only temporal measurement reported in short track speed skating is lap time, of which the relay exchange accounts for less than 30 %. As such, a more appropriate measurement of relay exchange performance might be the time taken to complete the straight where the relay exchange was executed. The aim of this study, therefore, was to validate a method for measuring straight time during elite short track <b>speed</b> skating <b>relays.</b> The proposed method used a single HD camcorder to create virtual timing gates at the start and end of both straights. To validate the method, straight times measured using the single HD camcorder were compared to synchronised cameras located perpendicular to the virtual timing gates. The root mean square error for both near and far straight times was less than the temporal resolution of the camera. In addition, Bland-Altman plots showed that the single HD camcorder method was invariant to race speed. Collectively, these findings suggest that a single HD camcorder does provide a valid method for measuring straight times during elite short track <b>speed</b> skating <b>relays...</b>|$|R

In order to perform this approach, the protection task is subdivided into different neural network modules for fault detection, fault classification as well as fault location. The suggested approach uses the Radial Basis Function Artificial Neural Network (RBFANN). The proposed scheme consists of nine RBFANNs, one for fault classification and faulty phase identification, four networks for faulty section estimation one for each fault type, and four networks for fault location within the faulty section, again one for each fault type. The three-phase voltages and currents are sampled at 1 kHz. Pre and post-fault data are utilized as inputs for the proposed scheme. The Electromagnetic Transient Program (EMTP) is used to generate simulation data for the typical Egyptian 500 kV transmission line in normal and faulty conditions to train and test the RBFNN.

40|$|The {{application}} of Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural networks for Fault Section Estimation (FSE) and fault classification and fault location within faulty section in transmission lines is presented. At the first step, a multi-way graph partitioning method based on weighted minimum degree reordering is proposed for effectively partitioning the original large-scale power system into desired number of connected sub-networks. After partitioning, the proposed scheme for {{each part of}} system consists of six RBFNNs, one networks for FSE, one for fault classification and four networks for fault location one for each fault type within the faulty section. For FSE, the relay and circuit breaker states are taken as the input to the distributed FSE system, while the states (faulted or normal) of transmission lines as the outputs. For fault classification, pre-fault and post-fault samples of the three-phase currents and another input from FSE are taken as the input, while faulty phase(s) as the output. For fault location, post-fault samples of both currents and voltages of the three phases and another input from both FSE and fault classification are taken as the input, while the fault locator as the output. To validate the proposed approach simulation studies {{have been carried out}} on IEEE 11 -bus system in normal and faulty conditions to train and test the RBFNN.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new concept}} in ultra-high <b>speed</b> distance <b>relay</b> for power line protection. The idea {{is based on the}} use of a sampling window shorter than usual to speed commutation. The reduction in protection time is obtained through a variable window that is expanded sample by sample until a satisfactory precision is reached in the calculation of fault quantities. The right window length is obtained automatically via software and time-by-time changes depending on the characteristics of the fault. The algorithm is based on the equation associated to the R-L fault circuit, whose solution is obtained using the phase modified Fourier transform. To validate the proposed procedure, a large number of simulations are performed with reference to an existing 150 -kV subtransmission line. In comparison with other solutions, the relay proposed here is very cost-effective and makes it possible to achieve ultra-high speed fault localization not only on high-voltage (HV) networks but also on medium-voltage (MV) distribution networks...|$|R
