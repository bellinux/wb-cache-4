25|$|In 1799 William Murdoch, {{who worked}} for the firm of Boulton and Watt, invented a new type of steam valve, called the D <b>slide</b> <b>valve.</b> This, in effect, slid {{backwards}} and forwards admitting steam to one end of the cylinder then the other. Matthew Murray improved the working of these valves by driving them with an eccentric gear attached to the rotating shaft of the engine.|$|E
25|$|Prolific {{inventor}} Joseph Bramah {{began his}} professional career installing water closets (toilets) that {{were based on}} Alexander Cumming's patented design of 1775. He found that the current model being installed in London houses {{had a tendency to}} freeze in cold weather. In collaboration with a Mr Allen, he improved the design by replacing the usual <b>slide</b> <b>valve</b> with a hinged flap that sealed the bottom of the bowl.|$|E
25|$|Boulton and Watt {{successfully}} challenged two of Murray's patents. Murray's patent of 1801, {{for improved}} air pumps and other innovations, and of 1802, for a self-contained compact engine {{with a new}} type of <b>slide</b> <b>valve,</b> were contested and overturned. In both cases, Murray had made the mistake of including too many improvements together in the same patent. This meant that if any one improvement were found to have infringed a copyright, the whole patent would be invalidated.|$|E
40|$|This paper fully {{describes}} the working principle of <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> in single-screw expanders (SSEs). A geometric analysis of suction and volume ratio <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> {{is presented to}} determine the relations between volume ratio, suction closure volume, discharge opening volume and <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> displacement. An organic Rankine cycle (ORC) thermodynamic model with SSE integrated with <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> is developed to analyze the power output of SSE and the net power output of ORC system and variation law of <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> displacement. Analysis of a typical ORC system under changing operating conditions shows that the power output of the expander and the net output power of the ORC system with <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> are much better than those without <b>slide</b> <b>valves.</b> When the condensing temperature is 40 °C and the waste availability is 80 kW, the increase in output power and net output power are approximately 3. 4 kW and 5 kW, respectively. The presented geometric analysis of <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> and the thermodynamic model integrated with <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> {{can be used to}} provide a theoretical and technical basis for designing the <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> of SSEs and the control strategies of <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> under varied operating conditions...|$|R
50|$|Locomotives {{usually had}} their <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> {{replaced}} with piston valves upon being fitted with superheated Watson Standard boilers, but the Class 3R retained their <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> throughout their working lives.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} used Murdoch's D unbalanced <b>slide</b> <b>valves,</b> arranged horizontally {{above the}} cylinders outside the plate frames and actuated by Heusinger valve gear. These valves caused considerable wear on motion pins and were later replaced by Trick ported balanced <b>slide</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
25|$|One day {{his father}} had promised {{to take him to}} a tannery the next day to see an engine that could run without a steam boiler. This tannery was located in Greenville, Ohio that {{his father had}} {{previously}} seen. When they arrived at the tannery the next morning, Lambert was disappointed to find that the building had burned to the ground the night before. He searched amongst the ashes and found the burned Otto gas engine. This was the only one he had ever heard of or seen. He took it apart to see how it was constructed. It was a <b>slide</b> <b>valve</b> coal gas engine.|$|E
25|$|The {{triple valve}} is {{described}} as being so named as it performs three functions: Charging air into an air tank ready to be used, applying the brakes, and releasing them. In so doing, it supports certain other actions (i.e. it 'holds' or maintains the application and it permits the exhaust of brake cylinder pressure and the recharging of the reservoir during the release). In his patent application, Westinghouse refers to his 'triple-valve device' because of the three component valvular parts comprising it: the diaphragm-operated poppet valve feeding reservoir air to the brake cylinder, the reservoir charging valve, and the brake cylinder release valve. When he soon improved the device by removing the poppet valve action, these three components became the piston valve, the <b>slide</b> <b>valve,</b> and the graduating valve.|$|E
2500|$|Murdoch was the {{inventor}} of the oscillating cylinder steam engine, and gas lighting is attributed to him in the early 1790s, also the term [...] "gasometer". However, Archibald Cochrane, ninth Earl of Dundonald, had already in 1789 used gas for lighting his family estate. Murdoch also made innovations to the steam engine, including the sun and planet gear and D <b>slide</b> <b>valve.</b> He invented the steam gun and the pneumatic tube message system, and worked on one of the first British paddle steamers to cross the English Channel. Murdoch built a prototype steam locomotive in 1784 and made a number of discoveries in chemistry.|$|E

2500|$|About $25,000 {{was spent}} {{remodeling}} Bailey Gatzert {{in preparation for}} its new route up the Columbia river. [...] The old poppet-valve engines were replaced by the <b>slide</b> <b>valve</b> engines from the steamer Telephone. [...] Auxiliary rudders were installed to improve steering in the swift waters of the Columbia Gorge. [...] Hull and cabin work was done by veteran shipbuilder Joseph Pacquet. [...] The officers on the steamer at that time were Captain Fred Sherman, pilot Sydney Scammon, mate, John Schiller, and Ruben Smith, chief engineer, and Dan O’Neil, purser. [...] Smith and O’Neil {{were two of the}} most experienced officers on the Columbia river, each having worked on the early steamer Columbia in the 1850s.|$|E
2500|$|In USSR, a {{deficiency}} of any {{vehicles in the}} market and low personal incomes led to great increasing of cheap 50cc mopeds and kits production. It achieves approximately a half million per year at the later 70s. As to technical level, it was analogous to pre-WW2 German models, with minimal changes made to later 80s. The only clip-on kit engine was [...] "D" [...] series ("Д-4" ... "Д-8Э"), a single-speed chain-driven 45cc 2-stroke motor with manual clutch and a rotary <b>slide</b> <b>valve</b> in a crankschaft. It was destined for clipping into a classic twin-diamond bike frame. At 2010s, it's still widely produced by some Chinese factories like Jiangdu in a piston distribution version, and has some popularity even in United States.|$|E

50|$|Several {{alterations}} {{were made}} to the locomotives by the IMR and CSAR. The original crank webs had solid crank-pin collars. New crank webs were fitted, which enabled solid bushed connecting and coupling rods to be fitted in place of the original split brass type. The original unbalanced <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> were replaced with balanced <b>slide</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{balanced}} <b>slide</b> <b>valve</b> {{was invented}} by the Scottish engineer Alexander Allan. It was not much used in the UK but, at one time, had great popularity in the United States.

50|$|Progress :This was {{actually}} a range of engine kits designed for the owner of only a small lathe, with the cylinder already bored and faced. These were produced in the 1920s and 1930s.
