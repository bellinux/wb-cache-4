25|$|In 1953, the trapeze {{tailpiece}} was dropped, {{and a new}} stopbar {{design was}} added. This design combined a pre-intonated bridge and tailpiece with two studs just behind the bridge pickup. This increased the sustain of the Goldtop noticeably; however, the intonation and <b>string</b> <b>height</b> adjustability were limited. A new design, the Tune-o-matic, replaced the stopbar in 1955. It consisted of a separate bridge and tailpiece attached directly {{to the top of}} the guitar, combining an easily adjustable bridge with a sustain-carrying tailpiece. This design has been used on most Les Pauls ever since. The tuners were produced by Kluson.|$|E
50|$|The System I bridge <b>string</b> <b>height</b> is set by {{adjustable}} {{pivot post}} screws {{and has no}} individual <b>string</b> <b>height</b> adjustments but has individual string intonation adjustments and {{is very much like}} the Gibson Tune-o-matic bridge in terms of intonation and <b>string</b> <b>height</b> adjustments.The System I tremolo system uses a behind the nut string locking mechanism.The System II and System III bridges have individual <b>string</b> <b>height</b> and individual string intonation adjustments.The System II and III tremolo systems use a height adjustable locking nut.|$|E
50|$|String {{slots in}} a nut without a zero fret must be {{cut to the}} proper depth to make <b>string</b> <b>height</b> correct. Strings that are too low at the nut can buzz against the frets, and too high throws off {{intonation}} of fretted notes.|$|E
50|$|An agraffe {{is a part}} {{found on}} some pianos. The agraffe is a guide at the tuning-pin end of the string, screwed into the plate, with holes through which the strings pass.

50|$|Bridges are {{designed}} to hold the strings at a suitable height above the fingerboard of the instrument. The ideal bridge height creates sufficient angularity in the string to create enough down force to drive the top, but places the strings sufficiently close to the fingerboard to make noting the <b>strings</b> easy. Bridge <b>height</b> may be fixed or alterable.|$|R
5000|$|Bass guitar {{technicians}} (or [...] "bass techs") {{perform the}} same functions for a bass guitar player. The bass guitar is {{a variety of}} electric guitar pitched below a regular electric guitar, typically by one octave. Many basic elements of {{the two types of}} instruments are similar enough—magnetic pickups routed to an electronic amplifier—that a guitar technician is usually able to work as a bass guitar technician if they become familiar with the unique aspects of the electric bass. The electric bass differs from the electric guitar in several respects. To become a bass tech, a person must learn how to set up the <b>string</b> action (<b>height)</b> and adjust the height of the pickups so that the bassist is able to create the tones associated with different bass styles. Depending on the band, these styles might include such as slap and pop, tapping, or upright bass-style playing with the thumb.|$|R
50|$|Early lap steel guitars were Spanish guitars {{modified}} by raising both {{the bridge and}} head nut. The <b>string</b> <b>height</b> at the head nut was raised to about half an inch by using a head nut converter or converter nut. This type of guitar is {{claimed to have been}} invented in about 1889 by Joseph Kekuku in Hawaii.|$|E
5000|$|For over {{a century}} Gibson went {{to the ends of}} the Earth and into the deepest forests to obtain the finest wood on the planet to hand make their instruments. Generations of luthiers carried on the skills of their trade. As the guitar {{industry}} underwent the change to mass production more guitars were produced cheaper. The demand for old growth trees for premium specialty wood increased rapidly. Restoring a fine classic instrument to new, or better than new condition is by far a better environmental choice than buying a new guitar. Collectors want to keep their guitars as close to original as possible, however there are some popular modifications Victory owners have made without damaging the instrument. Change out those nylon inserts, they dampen sustain, Victories were engineered to ring like a bell. Look in to a Stetsbar tremolo system if your Victory does not have the original Kahler tremolo system. The Stetsbar tremolo system bolts right on to the original posts without any routing or drilling. Consider locking machine heads with automatic string trim, they are easy to do yourself and they keep your guitar in tune even better. If the frets on your Victory are worn out, have a luther re-fret your fret board with stainless steel fret wire, the frets will last forever and you will never find better ebony. Do you want more control over <b>string</b> <b>height</b> on your Victory? Install a <b>string</b> <b>height</b> adjustable brass nut, especially if you like to play slide and fret at the same time - you can get your <b>string</b> <b>height</b> perfect. Victories were built tough and stiff to easily handle the high tension of using much heavier string gauges for slide without fret buzz and without tuning down. Let those big ol' cables ring! Keep all of your original parts in a safe place. Exact match paint for your Victory can now be mixed with the use of a hand held [...] "Spectrophotometer" [...] at your local auto paint supply, just bring it in.|$|E
50|$|A lap steel guitar's strings {{are raised}} {{at both the}} nut and bridge ends of the fingerboard, {{typically}} to about half an inch. The strings are too high to contact {{the surface of the}} neck, so frets, if present, are only for reference and are often replaced by markers. Some lap steel guitars can be converted between lap and fretted playing, or are modified versions of conventional guitars—the only difference is usually <b>string</b> <b>height.</b> Round-necked resonator guitars set up for steel playing fall into this category.|$|E

5000|$|Quality agraffes {{are usually}} made of solid brass {{but can be}} painted or electroplated. They come in 1, 2 or 3-string configurations. They also are {{available}} in 2 different sizes (1/4" [...] and 7/32"). The string holes are usually countersunk. They must be installed perpendicular to the <b>strings</b> and their <b>height</b> is adjusted using thin brass shims. They are sometimes difficult to remove and a broken agraffe usually requires a lengthy repair (especially if they are broken into the plate). Worn string holes sometimes cause a buzzing sound which can be corrected by filing inside the agraffe string hole to remove the imperfection.|$|R

A large number of Memphis guitars, {{manufactured}} in Japan, actually do NOT carry the Memphis waterslide decal.

50|$|The nut {{is a small}} {{strip of}} bone, plastic, brass, corian, graphite, {{stainless}} steel, or other medium-hard material, at the joint where the headstock meets the fretboard. Its grooves guide the strings onto the fretboard, giving consistent lateral string placement. It {{is one of the}} endpoints of the strings' vibrating length. It must be accurately cut, or it can contribute to tuning problems due to string slippage or string buzz. To reduce string friction in the nut, which can adversely affect tuning stability, some guitarists fit a roller nut. Some instruments use a zero fret {{just in front of the}} nut. In this case the nut is used only for lateral alignment of the strings, the <b>string</b> <b>height</b> and length being dictated by the zero fret.|$|E

50|$|The guitar tech {{also does}} {{a variety of}} regular maintenance. This {{includes}} checking that the <b>string</b> <b>height</b> of the guitars is set properly, modifying ("dressing") the height and arc of the frets, verifying the intonation of the instruments (which is adjusted by modifying the bridge), checking that tubes (valves) on tube amplifiers are working properly, and that cables are in good condition and free from crackles and hum caused by nicks and abrasions in the shielding or cable insulation. They also check the batteries on effects devices, tuners, and pre-amps, and change them if necessary.

5000|$|Bowed {{instrument}} strings, such as for {{the violin}} or cello, are usually described by tension rather than gauge. Fretted instruments (guitar, banjo, etc.) strings are usually described by gauge—the diameter of the string. The tone of a string depends partly on weight, and, therefore, on its diameter—its gauge. Usually, string manufactures that don't describe strings by tension list string diameter in thousandths of an inch (0.001 in = 0.0254 mm). The larger the diameter, the heavier the string. Heavier strings require more tension for the same pitch and are, as a consequence, harder to press down to the fingerboard. A fretted instrument that is restrung with different string gauges may require adjustment to the <b>string</b> <b>height</b> above the frets (the [...] "action") to maintain playing ease or keep the strings from buzzing against the frets. The action height of fretless instruments is also adjusted to suit the string gauge or material, {{as well as the}} intended playing style.|$|E
50|$|An {{ordinary}} guitar, either electric or acoustic, can be {{used for}} playing slide. Often, the strings are raised a little higher off the fingerboard than they would be for conventional guitar playing—especially if the player isn't going to use the free fingers for fretting. An extension nut may be used to achieve the higher <b>string</b> <b>height</b> at the peghead end of the fingerboard. This is just a normal nut, with the slots filed less deeply, and often in a straight line rather than following the radius of the fretboard.The lap steel and the pedal steel are guitars that have evolved especially for playing slide in the horizontal position. Resophonic or resonator guitars have often been employed for slide playing, typically held horizontally. They are sometimes known as Dobros after the Dopyera brothers, whose company first made them. National is another brand. In resonator guitars, rather than the sound being produced by the body's hollow, a special bridge transfers the vibrations from the strings to a metal cone placed inside the body.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a complete procedure that uses contextual and syntactic information {{to identify and}} recognize amount fields in the table regions of chemistry documents. The proposed method is composed of two main modules. Firstly, a structural analysis based on connected component (CC) dimensions and positions identifies some special symbols and clusters other CCs into three groups: fragment of characters, isolated characters or connected characters. Then, a specific processing is performed on each group of CCs. The fragment of characters are merged with the nearest character or string using geometric relationship based rules. The characters are sent to a recognition module to identify the numeral components. For the connected characters, the final decision on the string nature (numeric or non-numeric) is made based on a global score computed on the full <b>string</b> using the <b>height</b> regularity property and the recognition probabilities of its segmented fragments. Finally, a simple syntactic verification at table row level is conducted in order to correct eventual errors. The experimental tests are carried out on real-world chemistry documents provided by our industrial partner eNovalys.

Para tanto, quinze cultivares e treze linhagens foram avaliadas durante os anos agrícolas 2000 e 2001 no município de São Manuel - SP. O delineamento experimental foi de blocos casualizados, com quatro repetições. A parcela experimental foi constituída de 4 linhas de 4 m de comprimento com espaçamento entre linhas de 0, 5 m, considerando como área útil as duas linhas centrais. Avaliaram-se características como altura da inserção da primeira vagem, comprimento das vagens, florescimento pleno e ciclo, os componentes da produção (número de vagens por planta, número de grãos por planta, número de grãos por vagem e massa de 100 grãos), população final de plantas e produtividade de grãos, além das características tecnológicas dos grãos, teor de proteína bruta, tempo para cozimento e capacidade de hidratação.

50|$|The first {{prototype}} for the Esquire (and the later Telecaster) {{was completed by}} Leo Fender {{in the fall of}} 1949. The prototype shared with these guitars the now-familiar slab body shape with single cutaway to allow easier access to the upper frets. It likewise featured the distinctive combination bridge and pickup assembly, with a slanted pickup with individual pole pieces for each string, and three bridge saddles which allowed adjustment of string length in pairs and individual <b>string</b> <b>height.</b> The neck, like the first Esquires manufactured in 1950, was made from a single piece of maple without a truss rod. The neck was attached to the body with four screws and an anchor plate, unlike in traditional guitar construction, where a tenon on the neck is glued into the body. Unlike the Esquire, the neck was wider at the nut, and the head had 3 tuners on each side. The prototype differed from the later production guitars in several other respects: the body was made of pinewood, it was painted opaque white, its pickguard did not extend above the strings, it lacked a selector switch, and its volume and tone knobs were mounted on a slanted plate. Like the production models, it had a removable pickup cover, but unlike the production models, the cover had straight sides. The prototype had only one pickup, as did Esquires manufactured from 1951 onwards.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are five}} primary models of Zon Bass guitars: the Mosaic series, the Sonus series, the Legacy Elite, the VB and the Hyperbass. Many models are {{available}} {{in a variety of}} configurations such as five or six-string models or models with custom electronics or woods. A signature feature of the Zon basses is the use of Phenowood instead of wood as the material for the fingerboard, laid on top of a neck made of wood composite. Phenowood is wood, often birch, that has been impregnated with a phenolic resin, layered and compressed under heat. [...] The necks of Zon guitars that use these rigid materials usually do not have truss rods, since they are not subject to bowing. <b>String</b> <b>height</b> is adjusted from the bridge. The tone generated by these materials is clear and bell-like, and players such as Manring and Zander Zon use these qualities to incorporate harmonics prominently in their playing.The Hyperbass is a fretless four-string model which has a radical body shape featuring an extended cutaway to give access to a three-octave fretless fingerboard. The biggest departure from traditional construction is the use of four detuning heads (usually basses have at most one) and a unique bridge design, which allows selective tuning changes of one or more strings. This design allows quick changes to a vast selection of altered tunings. The design also incorporates four separate transducers mounted in various locations on the instrument and uses a special output connector to allow access to these individual signals in addition to the signal from the magnetic pickup.|$|E
40|$|Drilling fluids {{can build}} a gel {{structure}} under periods with ceased circulation. Pumping or drill string rotation {{can be used to}} break the gel. In some cases the measures might fail, e. g. gel breaking pressure might exceed the available pump pressure, or drill string rotation breaks the gel in the annulus, but not inside the drill string. The question arises about how high the drill string must be hoisted up in order for gravity to break the gel. A simple model for the hoisted drill fluid level height exist. It predicts the height to be linear and requires gel strength measurement as an input. Previous experimental work by Kronborg was an attempt to verify the model. The lack of advanced measuring techniques proved it difficult, and the results by Kronborg were inconclusive. This thesis aims to prove the model by the use of modern rheometer measurements. A series of amplitude sweeps in oscillatory tests are performed {{in order to determine the}} shear stress at flow point as the manifestation of the gel strength. The new measurements are used as the input to the model. The modelled, theoretical values of drill <b>string</b> <b>height</b> are compared to the experimentally measured. Also, previous measurement procedure is repeated. The results show a better coherence between the height values measured experimentally and the theoretical values with the newest gel strength measurements as an input. Still, the deviation between those values is too high to conclude the model to be correct. There might be several reasons for that. The model did not account for mud compressibility, thixotropy or temperature variation of the fluid. Also, sources of error are discussed and potential improvements suggested. The attempt to develop a mathematical correlation for the gel strength versus temperature and gelling time was made (the Gandelman correlation). It failed due to poor measurements results at elevated temperatures and long gelling times. </p...|$|E
5000|$|Bowed {{instruments}} pose {{a challenge}} to instrument builders, as compared with instruments that are only plucked (e.g, guitar), because on bowed instruments, the musician {{must be able to}} play one string at a time if they wish. As such, a bowed instrument must have a curved bridge that makes the [...] "outer" [...] <b>strings</b> lower in <b>height</b> than the [...] "inner" [...] strings. With such a curved bridge, the player can select one string at a time to play. On guitars and lutes, the bridge can be flat, because the strings are played by plucking them with the fingers, fingernails or a pick; by moving the fingers or pick to different positions, the player can play different strings. On bowed instruments, the need to play strings individually with the bow also limits the number of strings to about six or seven strings; with more strings, {{it would be impossible to}} select individual strings to bow. (Note: bowed strings can also play two bowed notes on two different strings at the same time, a technique called a double stop.) Indeed, on the orchestral string section instruments, four strings are the norm, with the exception of five strings used on some double basses. In contrast, with stringed keyboard instruments, 88 strings are used on a piano, and even though these strings are arranged on a flat bridge, the mechanism can play any of the notes individually.|$|R
6000|$|On 29th January, 1884, Miss Morton {{spoke to}} her inmate, as the lady in black stood beside a sofa. [...] "She only gave a slight gasp and moved towards the door.

[...] {199} In May and June Miss Morton {{fastened}} <b>strings</b> at different <b>heights</b> from the stair railings to the wall, where she attached them with glue, but she twice saw the lady pass through the cords, leaving them untouched. When Miss Morton cornered the figure and tried to touch her, or pounce on her, she dodged, or disappeared. But by a curious contradiction her steps were often heard by several of the family, and when she heard the steps, Miss Morton used to go out and follow the figure. There is really no more to tell. Miss Morton's father never saw the lady, even when she sat on a sofa for half an hour, Miss Morton watching her. Other people saw her in the garden crying, and sent messages to ask what was the matter, and who was the lady in distress. Many members of the family, boys, girls, married ladies, servants and others often saw the lady in black. In 1885 loud noises, bumps and turning of door handles were common, and though the servants were told that the lady was quite harmless, they did not always stay. The whole establishment of servants was gradually changed, but the lady still walked. She appeared more seldom in 1887-1889, and by 1892 even the light footsteps ceased.

40|$|Izvanredan značaj opusa Marka Andrijića za razvoj dalmatinske umjetnosti prikazan je njegovim najvećim ostvarenjima: ciborijem nad glavnim oltarom i završnim katom zvonika korčulanske katedrale kojim je, zajedno sa svoji m posljednjim djelom, zvonikom franjevačke crkve u Hvaru, stvorio prototip čitavog niza dalmatinskih renesansnih i baroknih zvonika. Autor također Andrijiću pripisuje dva do sada neprepoznata djela iz korčulanske katedrale: sakristiju i grobnicu biskupa Malumbre. The article {{tries to}} explain the {{extraordinary}} importance for Dalmatian art in general, and for architecture in particular, of Marko Andrijić, {{the greatest of all}} the master builders and sculptors of Korčula. He left his best achievements in the cathedral of his home town: the ciborium above the high altar and the top storey of the bell tower which, together with Marko 2 ̆ 7 s last work, the campanile of the Franciscan church in Hvar, became the model for a whole series of Dalmatian Renaissance and baroque church towers. A few architectural and sculptural works in the cathedral of Korčula which have not been recognized as works of Andrijić are ascribed to his opus. The construction of the campanile of the cathedral in Korčula dragged on through the whole first half of the fifteenth century, when the work stopped until the completion of the church. The sturdy lower part of the tower was built in the romanesque tradition. On 13 February 1481 Marko Andrijić signed a contract for the construction of the top part of the campanile. It was a combination of three basic architectural elements: -The main element is the octagonal loggia with pillars which carry the dome consisting of thin stone slabs grooved into diagonal stone ribs. -A narrow passage with a stone balustrade which Marko succeeded in creating around the loggia, above the 70 centimetres wide wall. -A lantern on top of the dome with eight slender pillars which continue the lines of the ribs. The structure of the top section of the Korčula belfry is particularly interesting. It is essentially a gothic skeletal structure in which each element has a clearly determined function. Also gothic is the requirement that the structure should be as light as possible. The profile of specific elements should be the smallest possible, utilizing the fabric almost to the ultimate limit of strength. However, because well-known elements were used in a completely new manner, we can define the structure as being in the mixed gothic-Renaissance style, which is usually used to describe Dalmatian decorative sculpture of this period. The dome is smooth within, while on the outside rounded ribs mark the edges. The segments of the dome consist of thin slabs (only 8 centimetres thick!) which are joggled together, and tongued and grooved into the ribs. Individual elements are so thin that they needed to be additionally fastened by means of copper cramps. These cramps, which tie together all the slabs and all the segments of the ribs, ensure the behaviour of the dome as a three-dimensional shell. Metal cramps take all tensile stresses, stone is loaded only in compression (which means that its bearing capacity is used to the maximum), and only vertical load is transmitted to the structural elements below the dome. A very satisfactory structural action of the loggia is thus achieved. We can {{go so far as to}} say that Marko, besides the knowledge acquired in his father 2 ̆ 7 s workshop, from his own experience as stone cutter and master builder, and from his study of buildings in his homeland and in Italy (his work in Venice was documented in 1473 and 1474, and in Mantua in 1478), was inspired by 223 Korčula 2 ̆ 7 s shipbuilding tradition. In the upper part of Andrijić 2 ̆ 7 s campanile there are a great number of carpentry-style joints between stone elements. ***** The dome of the Korčula campanile, built between 1481 and 1483, and the dome of the cathedral of Šibenik which was erected a little later by Nicolo di Giovanni Fiorentino to the design of his predecessor Juraj Dalmatinac (Giorgio da Sebenico), have a very similar basic structural concept: a combination of stone ribs tongued and grooved with thin slabs. Because we cannot evaluate exactly the responsibility of each of the two master builders for the structural idea, because the activity of Marko Andrijić falls between theirs, and because we know that Juraj and Nicolo came to Korčula to purchase stone for the building of Šibenik cathedral, it is to be supposed that the builders of Korčula and of Šibenik influenced each other. A comparison of the two buildings leads to the conclusion that Andrijić resolved most of formal and structural problems more successfully than Nicolo Fiorentino. Andrijić achieved the transition from the square to the octagonal plan by the use of a balustrade which "softens" the clash of the two geometrical forms. In Šibenik the change from the cubic base to the octagonal drum is straightforward. In Korčula the octagonal structural plan was followed through systematically: the eight pillars of the loggia continue into the eight ribs of the dome, and into the eight columns of the lantern. In Šibenik, on the other hand, each side of the drum is composed of two bays, so that only the angle pilasters have the logical structural continuation in the dome ribs, while those in the middle carry only the cornice. The lantern of the campanile in Korčula is a more successful crown to the composition than the finial on top of the dome in Šibenik, where a lantern could be expected both for formal and functional reasons - to let in light and air. The slabs of the dome in Korčula are joggled in such a way that the thickness of the dome is the same throughout, and its surface smooth within and without, while in Sibenik the joints are emphasized by the thicker lower edges of the slabs, a detail which added to the complexity of the construction. In the structural system of the dome in Korčula two kinds of stress - compression and tension - are opposed by two adequate materials: stone (slabs and ribs) and copper (cramps). In Šibenik the same material - stone- resists both kinds of stress. This can be described as structural "integrity", but it created a number of difficulties which were resolved by the use of a sophisticated system of grooves and stone wedges in the ribs. ***** Although there are some campanili with elements similar to those in Korčula, we find the distinctive combination of an octagonal domed loggia with a passageway and a stone balustrade only in the small Apulian town of Soleto. The tower, with the later parish church next to it, was built at the end of the fourteenth century by Francesco Colaci, but the upper section received its present shape only during its baroque restoration, when it was completely remodelled. The closest we can get to the campanile in Korčula is in two. Renaissance imaginary views kept in the Galleria degli Uffizi in Florence. The first of these is an engraving dated about 1475 and attributed to Bramante, while the authorship 224 of a drawing dated somewhat later has previously been ascribed to Peruzzi and more recently to Vasari. For the time being the question of whether the campanili depicted in these two vedute were real or imaginary "ideal" buildings remains open. ***** About twenty years after having built the campanile in Korčula, Marko erected the tower of the Franciscan church in Hvar. This time he was able to make the design for the complete building, not only for the upper part. Although he repeated the traditional concept of a square prism, lightened by the use of openings which increase towards the top, Andrijić articulated the mass of the building in a new way. Apart from the common string courses between the storeys, he introduced them also at the level of the capitals of the columns in the bays. The height of the storeys increases towards the top, which adds to the slenderness of the tower. It seems natural that at the beginning of the sixteenth century Andrijić abandoned the abundant gothic decoration which covered his campanile in Korčula. On the tower in Hvar he introduced Renaissance details, like the balustrade of classical simplicity and the attic below the dome. Apart from the gradual opening up of the wall mass, the slenderness and the visual ascent of the campanile were achieved by the increase in height of the storeys, which was carried out in a very subtle way. The proportions of individual storeys were derived from the square (1 : 1), from the golden section rectangle (0 = [J s+t l I 2) and from descendant rectangles (2 I 0, 2 I 3 0, 3 I 4 0, 4 I 50). the proportions of the lesser elements (bays, division of storeys by string courses) also belong to the same family. The relation between the proportions of the storeys, i. e. the increase in height of each single storey was obtained in a different way. The starting proportions are those of a square. The height of the second storey is achieved by the addition of the thickness of the string course to the height of the first storey, and the height of the third storey by adding to the second storey the thickness of two <b>string</b> courses. The <b>height</b> of the fourth storey is again obtained by the addition of the thickness of only one string course. In this way the increase in height of storeys is very slow, almost imperceptible, and the string courses are involved in the proportional scheme of the whole. We can say that the architect borrowed the method used by a sculptor who takes into consideration the view from below and elongates the upper parts of his sculpture to counterbalance perspective shortenings. The Franciscan bell tower is the first in the line of four campanili in Hvar which were erected in the same style. It seems quite certain that Andrijić 2 ̆ 7 s tower of the Franciscan church was the model for the builders of the cathedral belfry, and that it indirectly influenced the design of the campanili of the churches of St Mark and of|$|R
