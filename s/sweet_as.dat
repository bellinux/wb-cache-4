5|$|In 1984, Australia's Network Ten {{produced}} a television mini-series titled Bodyline, dramatising {{the events of}} the 1932–33 English tour of Australia. It starred Gary <b>Sweet</b> <b>as</b> Don Bradman, Hugo Weaving as Douglas Jardine, Jim Holt as Harold Larwood, Rhys McConnochie as Pelham Warner, and Frank Thring as Jardine's mentor Lord Harris. The series took some liberties with historical accuracy for the sake of drama, including a depiction of angry Australian fans burning a British flag at the Sydney Cricket Ground, an event which was never documented. Larwood, having emigrated to Australia in 1950, received several threatening and obscene phone calls after the series aired. The series was widely and strongly attacked by the surviving players for its inaccuracy and sensationalism.|$|E
25|$|Acesulfame {{potassium}} (Ace-K) is 200 times {{sweeter than}} sucrose (common sugar), as <b>sweet</b> <b>as</b> aspartame, about two thirds as <b>sweet</b> <b>as</b> saccharin, and one third as <b>sweet</b> <b>as</b> sucralose. Like saccharin, {{it has a}} slightly bitter aftertaste, especially at high concentrations. Kraft Foods has patented the use of sodium ferulate to mask acesulfame's aftertaste. Acesulfame potassium is often blended with other sweeteners (usually aspartame or sucralose), which give a more sucrose-like taste, whereby each sweetener masks the other's aftertaste and also exhibits a synergistic effect in which the blend is sweeter than its components.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} {{explanation for}} the company's decline in sales was that soda fountain operators (also called soda jerks) would give extra blasts of the syrup into the glass before adding the soda water. As Moxie was not as <b>sweet</b> <b>as</b> Coke or Dr. Pepper, this would not produce as delicious a refreshment.|$|E
25|$|Hort16A is {{a golden}} kiwifruit marketed {{worldwide}} in decreasing volumes because this variety suffered significant losses in New Zealand from late 2010 to 2013 {{due to the}} PSA bacterium. A new variety of golden kiwifruit, 'Gold3', {{has been found to}} be more disease-resistant and most growers have now grafted over to this variety. The Gold3 variety, marketed by Zespri as 'SunGold', is not quite as <b>sweet</b> <b>as</b> the previous Hort16A, with a hint of tanginess, and lacks the Hort16A's usually slightly pointy tip.|$|E
25|$|On May 2, 1864, the War Department {{appointed}} Colonel <b>Sweet</b> <b>as</b> {{commander of}} the camp. He {{had been at the}} camp for seven months and wanted the post. (Some historians now doubt his claim to have been wounded at the battle of Perryville, because he claimed that two wounds, including a chest wound, were treated by ordinary soldiers, not doctors. On the other hand, other sources say that his right arm was rendered useless by the wounds.) In any event, Sweet transferred to the Invalid Corps.|$|E

25|$|A 1997 straight-to-video adaptation, which cuts {{back on the}} violence, titled Titus Andronicus: The Movie, was {{directed}} by Lorn Richey and starred Ross Dippel as Titus, Aldrich Allen as Aaron) and Maureen Moran as Lavinia. Another straight-to-video- adaptation was made in 1998, directed by Christopher Dunne, and starring Robert Reese as Titus, Candy K. <b>Sweet</b> <b>as</b> Tamora, Lexton Raleigh as Aaron, Tom Dennis as Demitrius, with Levi David Tinker as Chiron and Amanda Gezik as Lavinia. This version enhanced the violence and increased the gore. For example, in the opening scene, Alarbus has his face skinned alive, and is then disembowelled and set on fire.|$|E
25|$|Instead {{of taking}} nectar, bees can take honeydew, the sweet {{secretions}} of aphids or other plant sap-sucking insects. Honeydew honey is very dark brown in color, {{with a rich}} fragrance of stewed fruit or fig jam, and is not as <b>sweet</b> <b>as</b> nectar honeys. Germany's Black Forest is a well known source of honeydew-based honeys, {{as well as some}} regions in Bulgaria, Tara (mountain) in Serbia, and Northern California in the United States. In Greece, pine honey (a type of honeydew honey) constitutes 60–65% of the annual honey production. Honeydew honey is popular in some areas, but in other areas, beekeepers have difficulty selling the stronger-flavored product.|$|E
25|$|Band {{members have}} cited power pop leaders Cheap Trick and Matthew <b>Sweet</b> <b>as</b> major influences. They also have cited the Talking Heads as an inspiration. John D. Luerssen of Allmusic {{has stated that}} they sound similar to The Knack, The Calling, and label-mates Fountains of Wayne. Mikael Wood of Baltimore City Paper has {{compared}} the Click Five to Fall Out Boy and the All-American Rejects in terms of sound and crossover appeal. In terms of songwriting, Bill Lamb of About.com has remarked that they seem reminiscent of The Beatles and The Beach Boys. Gary Susman of Entertainment Weekly has stated their vocal harmonies are similar to Queen, but they sing more like the Backstreet Boys.|$|E

25|$|Apart from sugar of lead (used as a {{sweetener}} {{in ancient}} through medieval times before the toxicity of lead was known), saccharin {{was the first}} artificial sweetener and was originally synthesized in 1879 by Remsen and Fahlberg. Its sweet taste was discovered by accident. It had been created in an experiment with toluene derivatives. A process {{for the creation of}} saccharin from phthalic anhydride was developed in 1950, and, currently, saccharin is created by this process as well as the original process by which it was discovered. It is 300 to 500 times as <b>sweet</b> <b>as</b> sugar (sucrose) and is often used to improve the taste of toothpastes, dietary foods, and dietary beverages. The bitter aftertaste of saccharin is often minimized by blending it with other sweeteners.|$|E
25|$|This {{album is}} filled with {{feelings}} of lethargy, languor and disengagement, yet most of the tracks sound warm and <b>sweet,</b> <b>as</b> opposed to those piquant self-centered ones before her motherhood. Reporters noticed that she began to smile more often in public and was not as icy or aloof as before. However, the album was released during the Asian financial crisis which swept East and Southeast Asia. Wong's old company Cinepoly, which retains the copyright on her previous records, released a Mandarin compilation {{at the same time}} in 1997 to counteract her new EMI album (and indeed outperformed it). Later, Cinepoly would release two compilations each year to compete with Faye's new releases, a tactic which has come under fire from her international fans. Faye Wong did not sell well in Hong Kong, but did quite well in Taiwan and mainland China. Although Wong had garnered some popularity with her 4 previous Mandarin albums, it was really this sweet yet slightly alternative album which had the Mainland Chinese audience listening. Her profile began to rise sharply in Asia.|$|E
25|$|He was {{the younger}} brother (by twelve years) of Joe Davis, who {{dominated}} snooker from 1927 to 1946; they are no relation to later champion Steve Davis. Joe retired from the World Snooker Championship after his 1946 victory, leaving the way open for Fred to win three times, in 1948, 1949 and 1951. Fred {{would go on to}} have the distinction of being the only player to beat Joe on level terms (albeit outside of the world championship as Joe retired from championship play in 1947), a feat he achieved four times between 1948 and 1954. Such victories were especially <b>sweet</b> <b>as</b> Joe had told Fred that he would never beat him. Following a disagreement between some of the players and the governing body, Davis played in an alternative tournament—the World Professional Match-play Championship—which he won on five consecutive occasions from 1952 to 1956. Between 1947 and 1954 Fred's great rival was Walter Donaldson, and they met in eight consecutive finals. Donaldson's 1947 victory over Davis by 82–63 was a huge shock and Davis put down his defeat to a mixture of over-confidence and Donaldson's solid practice regime ahead of the championship which gave him a huge edge in his long potting.|$|E
