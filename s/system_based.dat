In the literature, one can found many e orts where di erent reasoning <b>systems</b> <b>based</b> on di erent logics are linked to classic arti cial neural networks.

We prove that the xed point semantics of deductive databases and the immediate consequence operator can be implemented in the spiking neural P systems model...|$|R
5|$|Belgrade has an {{extensive}} public transport <b>system</b> <b>based</b> on buses (118 urban lines {{and more than}} 300 suburban lines), trams (12 lines), and trolleybuses (8 lines). It is run by GSP Beograd and SP Lasta, in cooperation with private companies on various bus routes. The BusPlus ticketing <b>system</b> <b>based</b> on contactless smart cards began operating in February 2012. Belgrade also has a S-train network, BG Voz, now run by the city government (previous commuter railway network, Beovoz, was abolished around 2013). The main railway station connects Belgrade with other European capitals and many towns in Serbia. Travel by coach is also popular, and the capital is well-served with daily connections to every town in Serbia and to many other European destinations through the central bus station.|$|E

5|$|Although officially {{designated}} a tropical cyclone by the NHC, Météo-France, the French meteorological service, stated in their annual {{report to the}} World Meteorological Organization that Grace {{should not have been}} classified a tropical system. In their report, they argued that although the storm presented deep convection, an eye-like feature, and winds above 60mph (95km/h), the overall development of Grace was more similar to that of a mid-latitude non-tropical cyclone. However, operationally, Météo-France considered Grace to be a subtropical cyclone. They also criticized the NHC of warning upon this <b>system</b> <b>based</b> on recent trends of the link between global warming and increased hurricane activity.|$|E
5|$|Aware of the {{inadequacy}} of bureaucracy in Austria, and wishing to improve it, Maria Theresa reformed education in 1775. In a new school <b>system</b> <b>based</b> on the Prussian one, all children of both genders from the ages of six to twelve were required to attend school. Education reform was met with hostility from many villages; Maria Theresa crushed the dissent by ordering the arrest of all those opposed. Although the idea had merit, the reforms were not as successful as {{they were expected to}} be since no funding was offered from the state; in some parts of Austria, half of the population was illiterate well into the 19thcentury.|$|E
5|$|Between 1973 and 1978, {{together}} with Dutch researcher Stan Tempelaars (1938–2010), Kaegi developed the VOSIM program. VOSIM, {{which stands for}} VOice SIMulator, is a <b>system</b> <b>based</b> on the digital sound synthesis of simple, sinusoidal square waves, allowing the modeling of vowel sounds, vocal fricatives and quasi-instrumental tones. It complemented, and was used in conjunction with, Gottfried Michael Koenig's own computer-generated music programs Project 1 (1964), Project 2 (1966) and SSP (1971). Werner Kaegi summed up the VOSIM system in 1986 in a presentation for the scientific journal Interface.|$|E

In particular, {{there is a limit to}} the complexity of <b>systems</b> <b>based</b> on hand-crafted rules, beyond which the systems become more and more unmanageable. However, creating more data to input to machine-learning systems simply requires a corresponding increase in the number of man-hours worked, generally without significant increases in the complexity of the annotation process.|$|R
