5000|$|Upon arriving, {{the clock}} display on the DeLorean's {{dashboard}} blinked 12:00, {{as a reference}} to a VCR that has lost power. The riders followed Biff's vehicle into a dormant volcano in which a Tyrannosaurus was discovered. Biff goaded it into attacking the riders, who barely escaped. It struck Biff's vehicle, sending it flying out of control; the dinosaur then swallowed the riders' vehicle, but spat it out mere seconds later. It then dropped down onto a lava river to see Biff's DeLorean, then damaged and unable to maneuver, moving down an active lava flow toward the edge of a cliff, with Biff pleading for help from Doc. As both vehicles plunged over the edge, the riders' one accelerated to time travel speed and bumped Biff's, sending both of them back through the vortex to the original point of departure - the present, at the Institute of Future Technology (in which they crashed through the Back to the Future logo in front), where Biff got out and thanked the riders and Doc for saving his life, but was soon seized by <b>security.</b> <b>Riders</b> exited the vehicle, as Doc thanked them and reminded them that, [...] "The future is what you make it!" [...] An animated logo of the Institute of Future Technology flashed up on the screen with the words [...] "Please lift lap bar and exit" [...] and after a few seconds Doc warned, [...] "Hurry up! Get out! Before you meet yourself coming in!" [...] As guests left, the song [...] "Back in Time" [...] played.|$|R
50|$|Most flat racing saddles weigh {{less than}} 1½ pounds; the lightest saddles weigh {{as little as}} 8 ounces. They {{generally}} have only one billet to attach the girth, and so an overgirth is usually added to keep it secure. Saddles used in steeplechases are generally slightly heavier and more substantial, usually being built on a full tree. Exercise saddles are usually larger and heavier, with a more prominent pommel and cantle to provide more <b>security</b> to the <b>rider.</b> Though these features add pounds, weight does not matter as it would in a race.|$|R
40|$|Recent advancements {{in mobile}} {{technology}} allow Global Positioning System (GPS) -enabled cell phones provide {{a variety of}} real-time location-based services (LBS). This paper reports on the design, implementation, and testing of such a service, the Travel Assistant Device (TAD), that aids transit riders with special needs to use public transportation. TAD is a program that provides the rider with customized real-time audio, visual, and tactile prompts for when they should exit the transit vehicle by announcing “Get ready [...] . ” and “Pull the cord now!” Additionally, TAD provides alerts to riders, their caretakers, and travel trainers if a rider deviated from the planned route. A website allows easy access {{for the creation of}} new trip itineraries and also allows monitoring the rider’s location by authorized personnel in real-time from any computer. While the TAD was designed to aid transit riders with special needs to increase their level of independence and their care-takers level of <b>security,</b> any <b>rider</b> new to a transit system can use TAD for planning and executing trips with confidence and ease...|$|R
2500|$|Method of fitting riders varies tremendously between designs. Length of {{the seat}} {{is the most common}} method by which saddles are fitted, though the length and {{placement}} of the flaps or fenders of the saddle also influence a person's leg position and thus the way an individual sits. [...] While a too long or too short seat will cause considerable discomfort, and even interfere with the <b>security</b> of the <b>rider</b> on the horse, width is also a factor. [...] Any well-fitting saddle should be wide enough to support the rider's seat bones, without being so wide as to cause discomfort. [...] While saddles are not usually marketed by seat width, designs do vary, and the only way a rider can determine the proper fit of a saddle is to sit on one.|$|R
5000|$|Due to the deep, secure-feeling seat, {{the design}} is also used by some people when {{starting}} young, unpredictable horses, and is quite popular for trail riding, endurance riding, and casual hacking. Many top-level endurance riders find this design superior to an [...] "endurance" [...] style saddle for distance competition because {{it allows them to}} get off the horse's back and move quickly over rough or mountainous terrain, yet provides greater <b>security</b> to the <b>rider.</b> On the other hand, this compromise design also means that an advanced rider may find the saddle limits his or her ability to obtain a correct position at higher levels of competition, either in show jumping or dressage. For this reason, some English riding instructors and coaches do not particularly encourage their riders to use these saddles.|$|R
50|$|At the Super Bowl XLVIII on February 2, 2014, mistaken {{estimates}} of rail ridership by the NFL led to over-crowding and delays on the Meadowlands Rail Line. New Jersey Transit {{was in charge}} of operating the Meadowlands Rail Line shuttle between Secaucus and Meadowlands. Approximately 28,000 people took the shuttle to Meadowlands before the Super Bowl, and were faced with waits of up to 90 minutes, due to <b>security</b> delays. Additionally, <b>riders</b> at Secaucus complained of the lack of air-conditioning. After the game ended, more than 33,000 people took the shuttle at Meadowlands back to Secaucus, far over the Meadowlands station's regular operating capacity. At one point, fans were asked to remain inside the stadium until more trains were dispatched to load passengers from the station. A plethora of news sources provided coverage of the plan's poor execution.|$|R
5000|$|The {{design of}} the Western saddle derives from the saddles of the Mexican vaqueros - the early horse {{trainers}} and cattle handlers of Mexico and the American Southwest. It was developed {{for the purpose of}} working cattle across vast areas, and came from a combination of the saddles used in the two main styles of horseback riding then practiced in Spain — la jineta, the Moorish style which allowed great freedom of movement to the horse; and la estradiota, later la brida, the jousting style, which provided great <b>security</b> to the <b>rider</b> and strong control of the horse. A very functional item was also added: the saddle [...] "horn." [...] This style of saddle allowed vaqueros to control cattle by use of a rope around the neck of the animal, tied or dallied (wrapped without a knot) around the horn.|$|R
2500|$|Western saddle; {{a saddle}} {{specially}} {{designed to allow}} horse and rider to work for many hours and to provide <b>security</b> to the <b>rider</b> in rough terrain or when moving quickly {{in response to the}} behavior of the livestock being herded. A western saddle has a deep seat with high pommel and cantle that provides a secure seat. Deep, wide stirrups provide comfort and security for the foot. A strong, wide saddle tree of wood, covered in rawhide (or made of a modern synthetic material) distributes the weight of the rider across a greater area of the horse's back, reducing the pounds carried per square inch and allowing the horse to be ridden longer without harm. A horn sits low in front of the rider, to which a lariat can be snubbed, and assorted dee rings and leather [...] "saddle strings" [...] allow additional equipment to be tied to the saddle.|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} bus stop crime {{and seeks to}} {{identify}} the environmental attributes that can affect the bus <b>rider's</b> <b>security</b> while at the bus stop. Using crime data for the years 1994 and 1995 made available by the transit division of the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the study discusses some general characteristics of bus stop crime. Following the argument of criminologists that certain place characteristics can affect the incidence of crime, the study employs qualitative research methodology (observation, mapping, interviews and surveys) to examine in detail the physical and social environment around the ten most dangerous bus stops in Los Angeles. It finds an abundance of "negative" environmental attributes and {{a general lack of}} "defensible space" elements. It also finds that different types of crime tend to occur under different environmental conditions. The paper discusses design responses as an approach to crime prevention at bus stops...|$|R

5000|$|There {{are many}} types of Western saddle available. Some are {{general-purpose}} models while others emphasize either greater freedom for the horse or greater <b>security</b> for the <b>rider,</b> as may be necessary for specialized work in the various Western horse sports such as cutting, reining, barrel racing, team roping, equitation and western pleasure. Factors such as width of the swells, height of the cantle, depth of the seat, placement of the stirrups and type of rigging all influence the uses of a given design. For example, a saddle with wide swells, high cantle and deep seat is suitable for cutting, where a rider must remain in a secure, quiet seat on the horse. At {{the other end of}} the spectrum, a saddle with a [...] "slick fork" [...] - virtually no swells - and a low cantle is suited for calf roping, where a rider must dismount quickly, often while the horse is still in motion, and not be caught up on the saddle.|$|R
50|$|The flat racing saddle is {{designed}} to not interfere with a running horse and to be as lightweight as possible (including the stirrup irons). The racing saddle has a very long seat without a dip to it, combined with extremely forward flaps that accommodate the very short stirrups and extreme forward seat used by jockeys. It also has a flat pommel and cantle so nothing interferes with the rider. Flat-racing saddles are built on a half-tree to reduce weight; because the rider spends {{most of the time}} up over the horse's withers, {{there is no need for}} the protection to the horse's spine that a full tree provides. The stirrups, instead of being looped over stirrup bars, are generally looped directly over the wooden bars of the half tree to prevent the loss of a stirrup during a race and to reduce bulk. This saddle provides very little <b>security,</b> placing the <b>rider</b> in a position that allows a horse the freedom of movement needed to achieve maximum speed, but at the cost of giving the rider less leverage to control the horse, and less protection for the horse's back from a sitting rider. Therefore, racing saddles are not suited for general equestrian riding.|$|R
40|$|The idea of {{developing}} this project comes from social responsibility towards the society. Bike riding {{is a lot}} of fun, but accidents happen. People choose motorbikes over car as it is much cheaper to run, easier to repair, easier to park and flexible in traffic. In India more than 37 million people are using two wheelers. Since usage is high accident percentage of two wheelers are also high compared to four wheelers. Motorcycles have high rate of fatal accidents than cars or trucks and buses. This project aims for accident avoidance, safety and <b>security</b> of bike <b>rider.</b> The main purpose of the project is to encourage wearing helmet. The system will ensure that the motorbike will not start unless the rider is wearing a helmet and has not consumed alcohol. Thus alcohol detection is also an important part in this project. Alcohol detection is done by MQ- 3 sensor and helmet detection is done by IR and PIR sensors. The system will also alert the bike rider if any obstacle comes too close while riding the bike. This is found to be useful at night or when the rider is drowsy or tired. By this accidents can be prevented. Also GSM technology is used to inform the family members in case of an accident. Accident detection is done using accelerometer. Wireless communication through Ask module is done between the helmet and motorbike...|$|R
40|$|The horse {{has been}} domesticated for several {{thousand}} years. It {{has gone from}} being used primarily for food and transportation, {{to become one of}} the most popular pets in Sweden. With over 150, 000 practitioners, horseback riding is one of the biggest sports in Sweden and there is a variety of specializations to choose from. One orientation is western riding which is a broad sport with several disciplines where most originate in cattle work and other ranch tasks. Western riding is a growing sport in Sweden with an increasing number of practitioners and with many different organizations and associations, it is important that the correct knowledge of the equipment used is disseminated. Artificial aids are available in a variety of designs and the most common variants used by western riders in Sweden is draw reins or some forms of martingale. The attitude against artificial aids vary, some believe they are beneficial, while others believe that they give a false sense of <b>security</b> to the <b>rider.</b> Both draw reins and martingales prevent the horse from being able to raise their head by restricting the movement in the horse's head and neck. The objective of draw reins is to make the horse to allocate more weight to the hind legs. To achieve this the draw reins have to be combined with a normal rein and it is also important that that the rider has great experience and knowledge of how the draw reins affect the horse and the potential risks it entails the horse. If you restraint the horse's movement in the head and neck, with for example draw reins, you also affect the rest of the horses body. There is a risk that the activity in the back could be reduced and the horse's movements tend to get "stilted" which is opposite of what one wishes to achieve. If the rider, with or without artificial aid, force the horse in to a certain ride style it affects not only the body and movement of the horse, but also the mind and it can make the horse experience frustration. To make facts about how the horse is affected by different types of equipment, easy for riding schools, trainers and riders to access it will reduce the misuse of this type of equipment. To be able to demonstrate effects of the reins, I believe that more research is needed. Adapting studies by how the actual user of the reins looks will make it easier to justify if the use of the reins is to advantage or disadvantage for both horse and rider...|$|R
