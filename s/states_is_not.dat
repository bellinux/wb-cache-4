5|$|Senators {{are elected}} in even-numbered {{years when the}} President of the United <b>States</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> being elected, similar to most other state offices in Maryland. The most recent {{election}} was in November 2014. Senators are not term-limited. Should a Senator resign from office before his or her term expires, the local central committee of the party to which the retiring senator belonged makes a recommendation to the Governor for whom to appoint to the open seat. It is tradition for the Governor to appoint the recommended person. Four of the current members of the Maryland State Senate were originally appointed, two of whom have since been elected in their own right. Newly elected Senators are sworn in and begin work on the second Wednesday of the January following their election.|$|E

5|$|To {{serve in}} the Maryland Senate, a person must be a citizen of Maryland 25 {{years of age or}} older. Elections for the 47 Senate seats are held every four years {{coincident}} with the federal election in which the President of the United <b>States</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> elected. Vacancies are filled through appointment by the Governor. The Senate meets for three months every year; {{the rest of the year}} the work of the Senate is light and most members hold another job during this time. It has been controlled by Democrats for a number of years. In the 2006 election, more than two-thirds of the Senate seats were won by Democrats.|$|E

25|$|The United <b>States</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> as {{workplace}} family-oriented as {{many other}} wealthy countries. According to a study released by Harvard and McGill University researchers in February 2007, workplace policies for families in the U.S. are weaker than those of all high-income countries and even many middle-and low-income countries. Other differences include the fact that fathers are granted paid paternity leave or paid parental leave in sixty-five countries; thirty one of these countries offer at least fourteen weeks of paid leave. The U.S. does not guarantee this to fathers.(survey) Sweden, Denmark and Norway have {{the highest level of}} maternity benefits—Sweden provides 68 weeks paid maternity leave, Norway provides 56 weeks paid maternity leave and Denmark provides 52.|$|E

25|$|Now {{that the}} Schengen Agreement {{is part of}} the acquis communautaire, it has, for EU members, lost the status of a treaty, which could only be amended {{according}} to its terms. Instead, amendments are made according to the legislative procedure of the EU under EU treaties. Ratification by the former agreement signatory <b>states</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> required for altering or repealing {{some or all of the}} former Schengen acquis. Legal acts setting out the conditions for entry into the Schengen Area are now made by majority vote in the EU's legislative bodies. New EU member states do not sign the Schengen Agreement as such, instead being bound to implement the Schengen rules as part of the pre-existing body of EU law, which every new entrant is required to accept.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{states are}} defined by anthropologists Spencer & Redmond as those states that {{developed}} in a context with no contact or prior development of a state in the area. These are those situations where states developed {{for the first time}} in that social environment. The exact number of cases which qualify as primary <b>states</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> clearly known because of limited information about political organization before the development of writing in many places; However, the list typically includes the first states to develop in Egypt, Mesopotamia, the Indus river valley, North China, Peru, and Mesoamerica. Cohen identifies six zones of independent state development: 1) a zone stretching from Europe and North Africa through the Middle East to East and South Asia, 2) Mesoamerica, 3) Peru, 4) West Africa, 5) East Africa, 6) Polynesia.|$|E
25|$|The United States Department of the Treasury has {{published}} model IGAs which follow two approaches. Under Model 1, financial {{institutions in the}} partner country report information about U.S. accounts to the tax authority of the partner country. That tax authority then provides {{the information to the}} United States. Model 1 comes in a reciprocal version (Model 1A), under which the United States will also share information about the partner country's taxpayers with the partner country, and a nonreciprocal version (Model 1B). Under Model 2, partner country financial institutions report directly to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, and the partner country agrees to lower any legal barriers to that reporting. Model 2 is available in two versions: 2A with no Tax Information Exchange Agreement (TIEA) or Double Tax Convention (DTC) required, and 2B for countries with a pre-existing TIEA or DTC. The agreements generally require parliamentary approval in the countries they are concluded with, but the United <b>States</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> pursuing ratification of this as a treaty.|$|E
