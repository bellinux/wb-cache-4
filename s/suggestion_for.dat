5|$|Brownhills is {{situated}} on the ancient Watling Street and {{there is evidence of}} early settlement in the area, including an ancient burial mound and a guard post believed to date from Roman times and later dubbed Knaves Castle. The name Brownhills, however, is not recorded before the 17th century. The most popular <b>suggestion</b> <b>for</b> the origin of the name is that it refers to the early mining spoil heaps which dotted the area.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} concerts, the group flew to New York's Record Plant Studios at Lambert's <b>suggestion,</b> <b>for</b> studio recordings. The group {{were joined by}} guests Al Kooper on Hammond organ, Ken Ascher on piano and Leslie West on guitar. Townshend used a 1957 Gretsch guitar, {{given to him by}} Joe Walsh, during the session and it went on to become his main guitar for studio recording. Lambert's {{participation}} in the recording was minimal, and he proved to be unable to mix the final recordings. He had started taking hard drugs, while Townshend was drinking brandy regularly. After returning to Britain, engineer Glyn Johns made safety copies of the Record Plant material but decided {{that it would be better}} to re-record it from scratch at Olympic Sound Studios in Barnes.|$|E
5|$|In the 1682 {{assembly}} of the Riksdag of the Estates, the king put forth his <b>suggestion</b> <b>for</b> military reform, whereby each of the lands of Sweden were to have 1,200 soldiers at the ready, at all times, and two farms were to provide accommodations for one soldier. His soldiers were known as Caroleans, trained to be skilled and preferring to attack rather than defend. Savaging and looting were strictly forbidden. Soldier huts around the country were the most visible {{part of the new}} Swedish allotment system. However, Charles also modernized the military techniques and worked to improve the overall skill and knowledge of the officers by sending them abroad to study.|$|E

5|$|Musical accompaniment for {{the silent}} films were not {{provided}} by the studios, and the Thanhouser productions were no exception. The musical program for the screenings were decided and played by the individual accompanists. At times, musical accompaniments were shared in trade journals and the musical accompaniment for Adrift was provided by an unnamed writer from Oklahoma in The Moving Picture World. The suggestion was {{to begin with a}} waltz until the friend pats the artist on the shoulder, when All I Get is Sympathy is played. The <b>suggestion</b> <b>for</b> I Don't Know Where I'm Going completes the scene and Life's A Funny Proposition follows the artist packing up until the artist pulls out the gun. A soft hurry follows as the girl confronts her father, leading to a crescendo at the climax.|$|E
5|$|One final <b>suggestion</b> <b>for</b> {{political}} policy {{reform is}} the notion that {{there ought to be a}} political balance in every branch of public service. Lack of balance in public institutions creates havens for reactionary forces, which in turn undermine democracy. Russell emphasises two conditions necessary for the achievement of balance. He advocates, first, the abolition of the legal standing of confessions as evidence, to remove the incentive for extraction of confession under torture by the police (Russell 1938:232). Second, the creation of dual branches of police to investigate particular crimes: one which presumes the innocence of the accused, the other presuming guilt (Russell 1938:233).|$|E
5|$|Planning of the {{extension}} of the suburban light rail Holmenkollen Line to the city center started in 1901. Construction began in 1912, but stopped again in 1914 because the municipality and the company could not agree on the location of the terminal station. The municipality wanted it at Ruseløkkveien. The following year, the municipality launched a contest to make the best <b>suggestion</b> <b>for</b> the tram networks. It took five years to select a winner, and this allowed the municipality and company to make a compromise by locating the terminus at Nationaltheatret. But not until 1926 was permission granted for the station. Construction commenced and the station and tunnel opened in 1928.|$|E

It took five years to select a winner, and this allowed the municipality and company to make a compromise by locating the terminus at Nationaltheatret. But not until 1926 was permission granted for the station. Construction commenced that year and the station and tunnel opened in 1928. When the tunnel had not been completed by 1922, Aker Municipality decided to purchase the line. At the time, the municipality was planning to start its own tram company, Akersbanerne, and the Smestad Line was considered as part of the network, along with the planned Sognsvann Line. But delays caused the Sognsvann Line not to open until 1934. The take-over caused a disagreement between the two companies about payment for the common section, which would still be owned by Holmenkolbanen. Not until 1932 was the issue resolved.|$|E

25|$|Although it is {{difficult}} to put a date on the erection of the dolmens, as they were in use until the dawn of the Christian era, it seems likely that they date from at least 2000 years BCE.

25|$|Dolichovespula adulterina is a known social {{parasite}} of Dolichovespula saxonica. However, it {{has been}} shown that Dolichovespula adulterina also uses D. norwegica as another host. One <b>suggestion</b> <b>for</b> this inquiline interaction between D. adulterina and D. norwegica is that D. adulterina has been found to cohabitate with D. norwegica. The two species were found to occupy the same space in Northern Norway, where there was no D. saxonica to be found nearby.|$|E

25|$|One <b>suggestion</b> <b>for</b> {{synchronizing}} inputs {{from the}} two ends of this cosmic experimental apparatus lies in the characteristics of quasars {{and the possibility of}} identifying identical events of some signal characteristic.

25|$|There is no joint {{parliamentary}} {{forum for}} the island of Ireland.

Under the 2007, St. Andrew's Agreement, the Northern Ireland Executive agreed to support the establishment of a North/South Consultative Forum and to encourage parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly to support the creation of a North/South parliamentary forum.|$|E
25|$|Fremantle {{joined the}} Admiralty in 1910 as the Head of the War Division, and by 1912, {{he was at}} Portsmouth as President of the Signal Committee. While in this role, Fremantle was charged with {{overseeing}} the overhaul of the existing signal systems and books to incorporate the latest advances made possible through wireless telegraphy. He was promoted to rear-admiral in 1913, and though his <b>suggestion</b> <b>for</b> a dedicated communications department was overtaken by the outbreak of war, a Signals Division was established at the Admiralty in 1914, with Fremantle as its head.|$|E

25|$|The {{policies}} for language revitalization have been changing {{in attempts to}} improve Maori language use and {{have been working with}} suggestions from the Waitangi Tribunal on the best ways to implement the revitalization. The Waitangi Tribunal in 2011 identified a <b>suggestion</b> <b>for</b> language revitalization that would shift indigenous policies from the central government to the preferences and ideologies of the Māori people. This change recognizes the issue of Te Reo revitalization as one of indigenous self-determination, instead of the job of the government to identify what would be best for the language and Maori people of New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>suggestion</b> <b>for</b> {{simplifying}} {{the proof}} is to make greater use of representation theory. The {{problem here is that}} representation theory seems to require very tight control over the subgroups of a group in order to work well. For groups of small rank one has such control and representation theory works very well, but for groups of larger rank no-one has succeeded in using it to simplify the classification. In {{the early days of the}} classification there was considerable effort made to use representation theory, but this never achieved much success in the higher rank case.|$|E
