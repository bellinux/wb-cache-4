25|$|There are {{two basic}} types of rotary <b>swaging</b> <b>machine,</b> the {{standard}} (also known as a tagging machine), and the butt <b>swaging</b> <b>machine.</b> A butt <b>swaging</b> <b>machine</b> works by having sets of wedges that close the dies onto the workpiece by inserting them between the annular rollers and the dies, normally {{by the use of}} a foot pedal. A butt <b>swaging</b> <b>machine</b> can allow a workpiece to be inserted without the dies closing on it, for example a three-foot workpiece can be inserted 12inches and then the dies closed, drawn through until 12inches remain and the dies are then released, the finished workpiece would then, for example, be four feet long but still of its initial diameter for a foot at each end.|$|E
25|$|A {{variation}} of the rotary swager is the creeping spindle <b>swaging</b> <b>machine</b> where both the spindle and cage revolve in opposite directions, this prevents the production of fins between the dies where the material being swaged grows up {{the gap between the}} dies.|$|E
25|$|A <b>swaging</b> <b>machine</b> {{works by}} using two or four split dies which {{separate}} and close up to 2000 times a minute. This action {{is achieved by}} mounting the dies into the machine's spindle which is rotated by a motor. The spindle is mounted inside a cage containing rollers (looks like a roller bearing). The rollers are larger than the cage so as the spindle spins the dies are pushed out to ride on the cage by centrifugal force, as the dies cross over the rollers they push the dies together because of their larger size. On a four-die machine, the number of rollers cause all dies to close at a time; {{if the number of}} rollers do not cause all pairs of dies to close at the same time then the machine is called a rotary forging machine, even though it is still a swaging process.|$|E

50|$|The {{machinery}} {{was left}} {{inside the building}} after the mill closed, {{with the exception of}} footpresses for riveting. It drew its power from a turbine beneath the building, which powered a direct current generator. The electricity from the generator drew a motor that turned a line shaft, to which the machinery was attached by belting. The machinery present included three power presses, one of them extensively modified by Messerschmidt; a knurling machine, built by Messerschmidt; two multiple-spindle screw machines; and seven <b>swaging</b> <b>machines,</b> as well as machinery and hand tools for metalworking in a toolroom contained in an addition to the building.|$|R
50|$|The U.S. bearing {{industry}} {{by this point}} was a $1 billion business, having tripled in size since World War II. As a leading producer of a broad line of anti-friction bearings, including needle, ball, roller, and specialty bearings, Torrington had benefited immeasurably from the prolific growth of the bearing industry, while the company's host of other products buttressed its financial performance. In addition to bearings, Torrington's eight domestic plants were devoted to the manufacture of nuts, screws, bolts, metal specialties, spokes and nipples, drill bits, surgeon needles, hooking and felting needles, <b>swaging</b> <b>machines,</b> and a special purpose sewing machine, lending a diversity to the company's business lines that insulated it from cyclical economic conditions to a large extent. Beyond U.S. borders, the Torrington empire comprised manufacturing facilities in England, Canada, Germany, Brazil, Italy, Portugal, and in Japan, giving the company a sizeable presence in key international markets. The domestic and international operations created a solid manufacturing entity that flourished during the 1960s. Sales, which stood at $33.6 million in 1950, totaled $67.5 million in 1960, then shot upward to $93.4 million in 1965. The following year, Torrington celebrated two century marks by reaching its 100th anniversary in business as well as reaching over $100 million in sales. By all accounts, Torrington was a thriving manufacturer—a company that had earned the respect of competitors—and now, as it mapped its course for its second century of business, it began {{to attract the attention}} of a handful of suitors intent on acquiring the venerable manufacturing concern.|$|R

40|$|Rotary swaging is an {{incremental}} bulk metal forming {{process for the}} manufacture of cylindrical lightweight components. Whilst conventional rotary swaging is still carried under the intense use of lubricants to provide desired work piece quality and to avoid forming die wear, recent scientific work focuses {{on the design of}} a dry process layout. Novel functionalized rotary swaging dies were introduced, exhibiting both diamond like carbon (DLC) hard coated and structured surfaces to encounter complex and opposing tribological requirements when dry machining. Such dies were successfully applied to infeed rotary <b>swaging</b> experiments <b>machining</b> steel 1. 0038 and aluminum 3. 3206 tubes. Although primary targets were achieved, the dry rotary swaging process is subject to an increased abrasive particle generation from the work piece material and accumulation of such particles in the forming zone. Abrasive particles provoke a loss of work piece quality and ultimately lead to a clogging of the swaging unit, associated with a significant earlier termination of the forming process. This work presents the investigation of the particle generation when dry rotary swaging with functionalized forming dies in dependence on the work piece material and the process parameter feed velocity. Subsequently, improvements of the die s design are discussed which are to reduce the generation of abrasive particles and conveying the particles from the swaging unit, indispensable for the robust layout of dry rotary swaging processes...|$|R

It was shown that even a pure titanium metal and its alloys spontaneously form a bone-like apatite layer on their surfaces within a living body. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the growth of calcium phosphates at the surface of the experimental alloy Ti- 7. 5 Mo. We produced ingots from pure titanium and molybdenum using an arc-melting furnace We then submitted these Ingots to heat treatment at 1100 degrees C for one hour, cooled the samples in water, and cold-worked the cooled material by <b>swaging</b> and <b>machining.</b> We measured the media roughness (Ra) with a roughness meter (1. 3 and 2. 6 mu m) and cut discs (13 mm in diameter and 4 mm in thickness) from each sample group.

40|$|Titânio e suas ligas têm sido utilizados em Odontologia devido sua biocompatibilidade e {{excelente}} resistência a corrosão. Esses metais são cobertos espontaneamente com uma fina camada de óxido em sua superfície quando em contato com o ar. No entanto, essa superfície do titânio é bioinerte e não se fixa quimicamente ao tecido ósseo. A proposta deste trabalho foi avaliar a bioatividade da liga Ti- 7, 5 Mo após tratamento de superfície químico e subseqüente tratamento térmico. Os lingotes foram obtidos a partir de titânio comercialmente puro e molibdênio utilizando um forno a arco voltaico. Depois submetidos a tratamento térmico a 1100 ºC por uma hora, resfriados em água, conformados a frio e torneados para obter microestrutura e morfologia próximas aos implantes dentários. A rugosidade média (Ra) foi medida em rugosímetro (1, 3 e 2, 6 Ym) e discos (10 mm de diâmetro e 4 mm de espessura) foram cortados a cada usinagem. As amostras foram divididas em dois grupos de acordo com a rugosidade: Grupo I (1, 3 Ym) e Grupo II (2, 6 Ym), e dois sub-grupos (tratamento alcalino e tratamento alcalino + tratamento térmico). Para o tratamento alcalino, as amostras foram imersas em solução aquosa de NaOH a 5 M, por 3 dias a 80 ºC, lavadas em água destilada e secas a 40 ºC por 24 h.

Titanium and its alloys {{have been}} used in dentistry due to their excellent corrosion resistance and biocompatibility. These metals are covered with a thin oxide layer formed spontaneously on their surface when in contact with air. However, titanium coating is bioinert and it cannot bond chemically to bone tissue. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the bioactivity of Ti- 7, 5 Mo alloy after processing, surface chemical treatment and subsequent heat treatment. Ingots were obtained from titanium and molybdenum by using an arc-melting furnace. They were submitted to heat treatment at 1100 ºC for one hour, cooled in water, cold worked by <b>swaging</b> and <b>machined</b> with a CNC lathe in order to achieve microstructure and morphology close to those of dental implants. Average roughness (Ra) was measured by roughness meter (1. 3 and 2. 6 Ym) and discs (10 mm in diameter and 4 mm in thickness) were cut for each one. Samples were divided in two groups according to the roughness: Group I (1. 3 Ym) and Group II (2. 6 Ym) and two subgroups (with or without heat treatment). They were ultrasonically cleaned with distilled water and acetone, and air dried prior to the surface treatment. For alkaline surface treatment, samples were immersed in aqueous NaOH solution with 5. 0 M at 80 ºC for 3 days, washed with distilled water and dried at 40 ºC for 24 h. For heat treatment, after the alkaline treatment, samples were heat treated at 600 ºC for 1 h in a electrical furnace in air. Then, all samples were immersed in SBF (Simulated Body Fluid) for 7 and 14 days to form an apatite layer on the surface. After the immersion time, the samples were carefully washed and dried, and their surfaces were characterized by optical profilometer and scanning electron microscope.
