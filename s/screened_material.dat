The appearance of the plan, {{with its emphasis on}} more of the same programmes, with a stricter ' over-lordship ' by ITA over the existing companies, has rightly been criticised from many quarters for its wilfully inadequate vision. Television can only, the plan implies, be run as a benevolent oligarchy, through which <b>screened</b> <b>material</b> is heavily filtered.

40|$|This study {{identifies}} the food {{habits of the}} margay, Leopardus wiedii (Schinz, 1821), and the jaguarundi, Puma yagouaroundi (É. Geoffroy Saint-Hilare, 1803), in the Vale do Rio Doce Natural Reserve and in the Sooretama Biological Reserve, Espírito Santo, Brazil. We determined the diet of both species by the analysis of scats. Fecal samples were collected from April 1995 to September 2000 and identified based {{on the presence of}} hairs that were ingested during self-grooming. Scats were oven-dried and washed on a sieve, and the <b>screened</b> <b>material</b> was identified using a reference collection. Of the 59 fecal samples examined, 30 were confirmed to be from the margay and nine of them from the jaguarundi. Mammals were the most consumed items in the diet of the margay, occurring in 77 % of the fecal samples, followed by birds (53 %) and reptiles (20 %). Among the mammals consumed, marsupials (Didelphimorphia) were the most common item (66 %). In the diet of the jaguarundi, birds were the most consumed items and occurred in 55 % of the fecal samples; mammals and reptiles occurred in 41 % and in 17 % of the fecal samples, respectively. From this work we conclude that the margay and jaguarundi fed mainly upon small vertebrates in the Vale do Rio Doce Natural Reserve and in the Sooretama Biological Reserve. Although sample sizes are therefore insufficient for quantitative comparisons, margays prey more frequently upon arboricolous mammals than jaguarundis, which in turn prey more frequently upon birds and reptiles than margays.

The detector probe was placed into a laboratory mock-up and tested to determine operating voltage, efficiency and energy resolution. Two gas flow proportional counters were built and tested. The detectors are cylindrical, each with a radius of 1. 905 cm, having an anode wire with a radius of 0. 0038 cm. The length of the smaller detector S anode was 2. 54 cm, and the length of the larger detector S anode was 7. 64 cm. Therefore, the active volumes were 28. 96 cm{sup 3 } and 87. 10 cm{sup 3 }, respectively, for the small and large detector.

40|$|Low {{harvesting}} {{costs and}} increasing demand for forest-derived biomass {{led to an}} increased use of full-tree (FT) harvesting in steep terrain areas in Austria. Logging residues, as a by-product of FT harvesting, present an easily accessible bioenergy resource, but high portions of fine particles and contaminants like earth particles and stones make them a complex and difficult fuel, as they affect storage capability, conversion efficiency, or emission rates adversely. The present research focuses on the productivity and performance of a star screen, which {{was used to remove}} fine and oversize particles from previously chipped, fresh Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) logging residue woodchips. Three screen settings, which differed in terms of different rotation speeds of the fine star elements (1861 rpm, 2239 rpm, 2624 rpm) were analyzed. Time studies of the star screen were carried out to estimate screening productivity and costs. Furthermore, 115 samples were collected from all material streams, which were assessed for particle size distribution, calorific value, ash content, and component and elemental composition. Average productivity was 20. 6 tonnes (t) per productive system hour (PSH 15), corresponding to screening costs of 9. 02 €/t. The results indicated that the screening of chipped logging residues with a star screen influenced material characteristics of the medium fraction, as it decreased the ash content, the incidence of fine particles, and the nutrient content. The different screen settings had a noticeable influence on the quality characteristics of the screening products. An increase of the rotation speed of the fine stars reduced screening costs per unit of <b>screened</b> <b>material</b> in the medium fraction, but also lowered screening quality...|$|E

In order to reuse RSM, it must be shown that the material poses no significant threat to public health or the environment. The Sun Recycling facilities in Broward and Palm Beach counties are C 2 ̆ 6 D facilities, generating RSM (i. e., soil with wood, concrete, other C 2 ̆ 6 D particles) through mechanical separation using screens. The process generates RSM meeting state requirements for industrial, commercial, and residential use. RSM was used on residential lots in Miramar to elevate low areas (excluding building pads). In accord with Broward County Environmental Protection Department (EPD) and Palm Beach County Department of Health (DOH) permits, Sun facilities perform regular testing of RSM. RSM tests showed arsenic (As) concentrations below state criteria. Quarterly testing did not detect VOCs, SVOCs, or pesticides. RSM was delivered to homesites and mixed with existing site soil. To address concerns raised by some residents, Miramar hired a consultant to collect samples for arsenic and total recoverable petroleum hydrocarbons (TRPH), resulting in reports of some As levels above residential criteria. Further sampling/analysis of RSM and local soils in the neighborhood were performed by Broward EPD and Sun.

40|$|Grapevine leafroll disease (GLRD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} virus diseases of grapevines around the country and the world. The disease reduces yields, delays fruit ripening, reduces soluble solids and can cause irregular or undesirable flavors. One response to minimize economic losses from GLRD, is the use of virus-tested grapevines. This study constructs a cost benefit analysis of using this material in California and New York. Benefits arise from the reduction in costs and increase in yield due to the reduction of disease prevalence from planting <b>screened</b> <b>material</b> and optimally managing the disease. Virus-tested material is available to nurseries and growers from grape centers including Foundation Plant Services in Davis, California and New York State Agriculture Experiment Station in Geneva, NY. Over the period 2006 - 2015 in California, estimated cumulative benefits by 2015 are $ 1. 51 billion (2002 dollars) and cumulative costs to operate Foundation Plant Services in Davis, CA, amount to $ 12. 9 million, a benefit to cost ratio of 117. Projecting over the next ten years, by 2025 cumulative net benefits (benefits-costs) will reach an estimated $ 3. 26 billion. Across the country in New York, benefits do not accrue until 2020 due to later adoption of virus-tested material. We estimate cumulative benefits reach $ 19. 5 million and funding from the National Clean Plant Network (NCPN) to operate the grape center in Geneva, NY totals $ 2. 7 million by 2025. Additionally, this thesis conducts a welfare analysis to determine the distribution of net benefits within California between grape producers and wine producers who purchase grapes to crush. The results suggest that grape growers receive most benefits because supply is inelastic relative to demand. These findings are valuable to understand the return of public and private investment in grape centers that produce virus-tested stocks for the industry, as well as help the industry understand the economic benefits of using the material, incentivizing stronger adoption...|$|E

The new program was re-titled ''Enabling Technology for Monitoring & Predicting Gas Turbine Health & Performance in IGCC Powerplants''. This final report summarizes the work accomplished from March 1, 2003 to March 31, 2004 {{on the four}} original tasks, and the work accomplished from April 1, 2004 to July 30, 2005 on the two re-directed tasks.

This task <b>screened</b> <b>material</b> performance and quantified the effects of high temperature erosion and corrosion of hot gas path materials in coal/IGCC applications. The materials of interest included those in current service as well as advanced, high-performance alloys and coatings. Task 2 [...] Material In-Service Health Monitoring: The second task was reduced in scope to demonstrate new technologies to determine the inservice health of advanced technology coal/IGCC powerplants. The task focused on two critical sensing needs for advanced coal/IGCC gas turbines: (1) Fuel Quality Sensor to rapidly determine the fuel heating value for more precise control of the gas turbine, and detection of fuel impurities {{that could lead to}} rapid component degradation. (2) Infra-Red Pyrometer to continuously measure the temperature of gas turbine buckets, nozzles, and combustor hardware. Task 3 [...] Advanced Methods for Combustion Monitoring and Control: The third task was originally to develop and validate advanced monitoring and control methods for coal/IGCC gas turbine combustion systems. This task was refocused to address pre-mixed combustion phenomenon for IGCC applications. The work effort on this task was shifted to another joint GE Energy/DOE-NETL program investigation, High Hydrogen Pre-mixer Designs, as of April 1, 2004. Task 4 [...] Information Technology (IT) Integration: The fourth task was originally to demonstrate Information Technology (IT) tools for advanced technology coal/IGCC powerplant condition assessment and condition based maintenance. The task focused on development of GateCycle. software to model complete-plant IGCC systems, and the Universal On-Site Monitor (UOSM) to collect and integrate data from multiple condition monitoring applications at a power plant.

40|$|M. Sc. This study {{focuses on}} the {{rehabilitation}} of borrow pits on linear pipeline projects. In the past {{there have been many}} attempts to rehabilitate borrow pits to an ecological acceptable manner. Recently legislation has become more stringent regarding mine closure and rehabilitation. With the introduction of the new Mineral and Petroleum Development Act (MPRDA 28 of 2002), there has been an increase of awareness towards the immediate environment. As this project was a challenge in itself, there were no clear and concise methods in the Act that provide guidelines for final rehabilitation. Normally borrow pits as used on road concessions for material sourcing is left as different landforms like before excavation. The main {{reason for this is that}} materials are removed from the pits and not replaced, resulting in areas that are usually lower than their original ground levels. Some unwanted <b>screened</b> <b>material</b> will return to these borrow pits but will not complement what the original level should be. These borrow pits are usually clearly visible as low lying areas filled with water alongside roads. The Vaal River Eastern Subsection Augmentation Project (VRESAP) pipeline borrow pits were unique in the sense that not only material from screening activities were replaced, but also material excavated from the trench were replaced into the borrow pits. What makes this study unique is the fact that an opportunity was presented and clearly stipulated by the standard environmental management plan (SEMP) that borrow pits had to be filled back to their original ground levels or an acceptable level agreed on by the landowner. With this unique project, unique problems arose causing excess material amounting to 327 700 m³, available from the pipeline cavity. External spoil areas had to be promulgated and managed as part of site. This study through its various elements addresses some of the main problems encountered on VRESAP by looking at soil analysis, monitoring regimes, pre and post land use and other mechanisms from literature studies used on similar projects in the mining industry. vii The study also provides recommendations to the reader for future pipeline developments as well as conclusions made by the author. The recommendations made, include ways of rehabilitation planning through trials and errors made on site.

With retroreflective screens, the screen center might be brighter than the screen periphery, a kind of hot spotting. This differs from semi-specular screens where the hot spot's location varies depending on the viewer's position in the audience.
