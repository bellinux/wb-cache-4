40|$|By {{incorporating}} the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) satellite orbital information into the Colorado State University General Circulation Model (CSU GCM), {{we are able}} to 'fly' a satellite in the GCM, and sample the simulated atmosphere {{in the same way as}} the TRMM sensors sample the real atmosphere. The TRMM-sampled statistics for precipitation and radiative fluxes at annual, intraseasonal, monthly-mean and seasonal-mean diurnal time scales are evaluated by comparing the satellite-sampled against fully-sampled simulated atmospheres. The sampling rates of the TRMM sensors are significantly affected by the sensors' <b>swath</b> <b>widths.</b> The TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) and the Visible Infrared Scanner (VIRS) sample each 2. 25 x 2. 25 degree grid box in the Tropics and subtropics about once per day, but at a different local time every day, while the Precipitation Radar (PR) and the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) sensor visit each grid box about once every three days and twice per day, respectively. Besides inadequate samplings resulting from sensors' <b>swath</b> <b>widths,</b> there is a large, systematic diurnal undersampling associated with TRMM's orbital geometry for grid boxes away from the Equator. When only one month of TRMM data are used, this diurnal undersampling can lead to more daytime samples relative to nighttime samples in one hemisphere, and more nighttime samples relative to daytime samples in the other hemisphere. The resulting sampling biases (3 - 6 W m(exp- 2)) are very pronounced in outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) over the subtropical land masses. The sampling errors in OLR monthly- and seasonal-means are less than 8 W m(exp- 2) (5 %) for each 2. 25 x 2. 25 degree grid box. The OLR monthly- and seasonal-means are not sensitive to diurnal undersamplings associated with the TRMM orbits and sensors' <b>swath</b> <b>widths.</b> However, this is not the case for total precipitation. Diurnal undersampling could produce errors as large as 20 % in the Tropics and 40 % in the subtropics, for the zonally averaged monthly-mean rain rates. The TRMM orbits sample each 2. 25 x 2. 25 degree grid box in the Tropics and subtropics 1 - 6 times for each hour of the day within a single season. The seasonal-mean diurnal cycles of precipitation and OLR are not well sampled for any one grid box. By either accumulating the satellite data for a long enough period, or averaging the data over a large area with a relatively uniform diurnal signal, the diurnal cycles of precipitation and OLR can be satisfactorily sampled. The effects TRMM sampling errors on the inferred tropical-mean hydrologic cycle and radiative fluxes are also evaluated. There are strong spurious oscillations associated with TRMM's orbital geometry, with periods of 23 days and 3 - 4 months, in tropical-mean daily and monthly precipitation. While the relative fluctuations of the sampled-OLR are negligible, the relative fluctuations of the sampled precipitation have magnitudes similar to those of the observed climate variability. Caution must therefore be used when applying TRMM observations of tropical-mean precipitation to interpret climate variations at intraseasonal and interannual scales...|$|R

40|$|High-resolution wide-swath (HRWS) {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) systems based on digital beamforming (DBF) in elevation are very attractive for the observation of dynamic processes on the Earth’s surface. However, due to their resolutions and <b>swath</b> <b>widths,</b> HRWS systems are inherently associated with a huge data volume. Furthermore, a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) {{much higher than the}} required processed Doppler bandwidth is often desirable to comply with azimuth ambiguity requirements. The data volume can be significantly reduced, if on-board Doppler filtering and decimation are performed before downlinking the data. This paper presents different criteria for the design of the low-pass filter and shows that a finite impulse response (FIR) filter with {{a relatively small number of}} taps is sufficient to completely suppress the additional ambiguous components and recover the original impulse response, provided that a compensation of the filter transfer function is performed within the processing.

40|$|Across {{boreal forests}} and {{resource}} rich areas, human-induced change is rapidly occurring at various spatial scales. In the past, satellite remote sensing {{has provided a}} cost effective, reliable method of monitoring these changes over time and over relatively small areas. Those instruments offering high spatial detail, such as Landsat Thematic Mapper or Enhanced Thematic Mapper (TM or ETM+), typically have small <b>swath</b> <b>widths</b> and long repeat times that result in compositing intervals that are too large to resolve accurate time scales {{for many of these}} changes. Obtaining multiple scenes and producing maps over very large, forested areas is further restricted by high processing costs and the small window of acquisition opportunity. Coarse spatial resolution instruments – such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) or the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) – typically have short revisit times (days rather than weeks), large <b>swath</b> <b>widths</b> (hundreds of kilometres), and in some cases, hyperspectral resolutions, making them prime candidates for multiple-scale change detection research initiatives. In this thesis, the effectiveness of 250 m spatial resolution MODIS data for the purpose of updating existing large-area, 30 m spatial resolution Landsat TM land cover map product is tested. A land cover polygon layer was derived by segmentation of Landsat TM data using eCognition 4. 0. This polygon layer was used to create a polygon-based MODIS NDVI time series consisting of imagery acquired in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005. These MODIS images were then differenced to produce six multiple-scale layers of change. Accuracy assessment, based on available GIS data in a subregion of the larger map area, showed an overall accuracy as high as 59 % with the largest error associated with change omission (0. 51). The Cramer’s V correlation coefficient (0. 38) was calculated using the GIS data. This was compared to the results of an index-based Landsat change detection, Cramer’s V= 0. 67. This thesis research showed that areas greater than 15 hectares are adequately represented (approximately 75 % accuracy) with the MODIS-based change detection technique. The resulting change information offers potential to identify areas that have been burned or extensively logged, and provides general information on those areas that have experienced greater change and are likely suitable for analysis with higher spatial resolution data...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{introduction}} to the academic community of multibeam sonar swath mapping techniques in the late 1970 s, the ability to collect high-resolution bathymetry and seafloor imagery has steadily increased. Early systems provided a limited number (e. g., 16) of relatively broad (2 - 4 degree) beams and <b>swath</b> <b>widths</b> of approximately one times the water depth, whereas current systems offer hundreds of narrower (0. 5 to 1 degree) beams over <b>swath</b> <b>widths</b> of five to seven times water depth. Innovations like chirped pulses and high-density beam forming (multiple depth solutions per beam footprint) have also pushed the resolution of modern systems. Despite these improvements, the resolution achievable is fundamentally limited by trade-offs between beam width, bandwidth, transducer size and propagation, resulting in the need for short ranges to the seafloor to achieve the highest levels of resolution. In the deep sea this means delivery of high-frequency, high-resolution mapping systems close to the bottom by means of towed or autonomous vehicles, the trade-off here being limited areal coverage due to narrow swaths and slow mapping speeds. Despite these constraints, we cannot forget that {{only a small fraction of}} the deep ocean has been mapped by any sort of swath mapping system (10 - 20 %) and that even a single well-calibrated and properly operated multibeam swath collected at high-speed during a long transit can offer a remarkable amount of insight into seafloor processes. We will illustrate this through the exploration of a single transit by the R/V KILO MOANA (using a Kongsberg EM 120 MBES) from Hawaii to Kodiak Alaska. When compared to the best available global bathymetric compilations using both satellite derived bathymetry and existing bathymetric data (e. g., Global Topography of Smith and Sandwell, GMRT, or ETOPO- 1), the single swath offers detailed views of deep-sea channels, seamount and guyots, tectonic structure and volcanic processes that are totally absent in the compilations.
