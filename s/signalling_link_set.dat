40|$|Signalling is the {{critical}} component of telecommunications networks. Thus {{the design of the}} signalling system is a fundamental issue for the creation of the future Broadband ISDN out of ATM switching technology. Today 2 ̆ 7 s telecommunication networks use common channel signalling networks (standardised in SS 7) which are often separate from the bearer or transport network. With an ATM based Broadband ISDN (B-ISDN), it is anticipated that both signalHng and user traffic will share the underlying ATM layer. An SS 7 2 ̆ 2 Message Transfer Part 2 ̆ 2 (MTP) provides reliable connectionless signalling message transport. However due to differences between SS 7 <b>links</b> and ATM <b>signalling</b> <b>links</b> (i. e. ATM Virtual Channel Connections (VCCs)), a new MTP will be needed for B-ISDN. This thesis is concerned with the design and engineering of the B-ISDN MTP The need for an ATM <b>signalling</b> <b>link</b> error monitor is identified as a key requirement. To design such an error monitor, the delay performance of ATM <b>signalling</b> <b>links</b> during errored periods must be determined. This requires a model for the delay performance of the Service Specific Connection Oriented Protocol (SSCOP), the link level protocol to be used on ATM <b>signalling</b> <b>links.</b> The thesis presents an SSCOP delay model, which also gives general results for mean Selective Repeat transmitter delay and the mean (and distribution) of Selective Repeat receiver delay...|$|R

A multi-DOF mechanism {{is treated as}} an assembly of several single DOF <b>link</b> <b>sets</b> and hence the terms like affected <b>link</b> <b>set,</b> active <b>link</b> <b>set</b> and active centro have been defined. Criteria for end-effector dependent and end-effector independent singularities of a closed-loop manipulator with given output link have been established in the paper in terms of centroes. Based on the relative disposition of the centroes, the singularities have been classified into five types and their physical implications have been explained. End-effector dependent singularities are shown to lie on the coupler curve of ab larger single DOF mechanism. A simple linkage transformation has been proposed {{for the study of}} manipulators with physical limits on joint motion under the general framework of close-loop manipulators.
