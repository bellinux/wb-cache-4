5|$|Pallas is {{farther from}} Earth {{and has a}} much lower albedo than Vesta, and hence is dimmer as seen from Earth. Indeed, the much smaller 7 Iris {{marginally}} exceeds Pallas in mean opposition magnitude. Pallas's mean opposition magnitude is +8.0, which is well {{within the range of}} 10×50 binoculars, but, unlike Ceres and Vesta, it will require more-powerful optical aid to view at small elongations, when its magnitude can drop as low as +10.6. During rare perihelic oppositions, Pallas can reach a magnitude of +6.4, right on the edge of naked-eye visibility. During late February 2014 Pallas <b>shone</b> <b>with</b> magnitude 6.96.|$|E
5|$|Having {{resolved}} {{the issue of}} his playing future, Miller was back in a good frame of mind for the Fourth Test in Adelaide. In a high-scoring match, Miller took a wicket in each innings, but he <b>shone</b> <b>with</b> the bat. England batted first and had reached a strong position of 4/320 {{on the second day}} when Miller bowled Joe Hardstaff junior, who edged a bouncer into his stumps for 67, ending a partnership of 118 with centurion Compton; the hosts lost wickets steadily thereafter to be dismissed for 460, and Miller ended with 1/45 from 16 overs in extreme heat. After Morris and Hassett put on 179 runs for the third wicket, Miller came in at 3/207 late on the third day and reached 33 by the time stumps were drawn with Australia at 4/293, while his partner Johnson was unbeaten on 35.|$|E
5|$|Off the pitch, Miller privately {{decided that}} he would not honour his Rawtenstall contract. He {{secretly}} accepted an offer to relocate to Sydney to work as a liquor salesman and play cricket. Back in a good frame of mind for the Fourth Test in Adelaide, Miller took one wicket in each innings, but he <b>shone</b> <b>with</b> the bat. After England had made 460, Miller came in at 3/207, and was 23 not out by the close of the second day. He hit the first ball of the next day for six, and accumulated 67 runs in the opening 71 minutes, to reach his maiden Test century. The Englishmen utilised leg theory to prevent easy scoring, but as the tail began to be dismissed, Miller accelerated, launching drives into the crowd, despite the presence of four men on the fence. Miller ended unbeaten on 141 but the match petered out into a high-scoring draw. Before the last Test, Miller played for Victoria against England, taking 4/65.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{remarkable}} findings in the tunnel chambers was a miniature mountainous landscape, 17 metres underground, with tiny pools of liquid mercury representing lakes. The walls and ceiling of the tunnel were found to have been carefully impregnated with mineral powder composed of magnetite, pyrite known as fool's gold and hematite, providing a special brightness to the place and to give the effect of standing under the stars as a peculiar re-creation of the underworld. At the end of the passage Gómez Chávez’s team uncovered four greenstone statues, wearing garments and beads, and their open eyes would have <b>shone</b> <b>with</b> precious minerals. Two of the figurines were still in their original positions, leaning back and apparently contemplating up at the axis where the three planes of the universe meet - probably the founding shamans of Teotihuacan, guiding pilgrims to the sanctuary, and carrying bundles of sacred objects used to perform rituals, including pendants and pyrite mirrors, which were perceived as portals to other realms.|$|E
500|$|Gifted {{players in}} the 1940s and the 1950s {{included}} centre-back Louis Carré and attackers Jef Mermans, Pol Anoul and Rik Coppens; at the 1954 World Cup, Anoul <b>shone</b> <b>with</b> three goals, and newspaper L'Équipe named Coppens the event's best centre forward. The 1960s and the early 1970s were {{the glory days of}} forward and four-time Belgian Golden Shoe Paul Van Himst, later elected Belgian UEFA Golden Player of 1954–2003 and Belgium's Player of the Century by IFFHS. At the 1965 Ballon d'Or, Van Himst ranked fourth, achieving Belgium's highest ever position at the European football election. Decades after Coppens and Van Himst had retired from playing football, a journalist on a Flemish television show asked them [...] "Who [...] was the best, actually?". Coppens replied: [...] "I will ask Paul that... If Paul says it was me, then he's right". In 1966, striker Raoul Lambert and defending midfielder Wilfried Van Moer joined the national team; while the UEFA praised Lambert for his skills at Euro 1972, Van Moer won three Golden Shoes and equalled Van Himst's fourth rank at the Ballon d'Or in 1980.|$|E

2500|$|According to the Mahabharata, after {{entering}} the svarga {{with a human}} body on Indra's invitation, Yudhishthira witnessed that Duryodhana [...] "was seated on a beautiful throne and he <b>shone</b> <b>with</b> the splendour {{of the sun and}} around him stood in attendance the goddess of heroism and other angels." [...] Yudhishthira found this insufferable and reminded the dwellers of svarga about his sinful deeds. Following that, Narada smiled at Yudhishthira and said that [...] "the brave Duryodhana had attained his present state by force of kshatriya dharma." [...] The Mahabharata further mentions that in svarga, Duryodhana and his brothers [...] "attained the state of the gods." ...|$|E
2500|$|The modernist critic Yuly Aykhenvald, {{analyzing}} the cliché formula that bonded [...] "Maykov, Polonsky and Fet" [...] into a solid group of similar-minded authors, alleged that Maykov [...] "to {{a lesser extent}} {{than the other two}} freed himself from the habit of copying classics" [...] and [...] "in his earlier works was unoriginal, producing verse that <b>shone</b> <b>with</b> reflected light." [...] Not even his passionate love for classics could help the author submerge [...] "wholly into the pagan element," [...] the critic opined.He was a scholar of antiquity and his gift, self-admittedly [...] "has been strengthened by being tempered in the fire of science." [...] As a purveyor of classicism, his very soul was not deep or naive enough to fully let this spirit in or embrace the antique idea of intellectual freedom. Poems, inhabited by naiads, nymphs, muses and dryads, are very pretty, and you can't help being enchanted by these ancient fables. But he gives you no chance to forget for a moment that – what for his ancient heroes was life itself, for him is only a myth, a 'clever lie' he could never believe himself.|$|E

2500|$|In The Fellowship of the Ring, Aragorn joined Frodo Baggins, Bilbo's adopted heir, {{and three}} of Frodo's friends at the Inn of the Prancing Pony in Bree; a letter from Gandalf {{convinced}} Frodo to trust Aragorn. The four hobbits had set out from the Shire to bring the One Ring to Rivendell. Aragorn, going by the nickname [...] "Strider", was then aged 87, nearing the prime of life for one of royal Númenórean descent. With Aragorn's help the Hobbits escaped the pursuing Nazgûl and reached Rivendell. There Frodo volunteered to destroy the Ring in the fires of Mount Doom, and Aragorn was chosen {{as a member of}} the Fellowship of the Ring to accompany him, along with Gandalf, Legolas the elf, Gimli the dwarf, Boromir of Gondor, and the hobbits Pippin, Merry, and Frodo's faithful gardener Samwise Gamgee. Elven-smiths reforged the shards of Narsil into a new sword, setting into the design of the blade seven stars (for Elendil) and a crescent moon (for Isildur), as well as many runes. Aragorn renamed the sword Andúril (meaning [...] "flame of the west" [...] in Sindarin), and it was said to have <b>shone</b> <b>with</b> the light of the Sun and the Moon.|$|E
2500|$|Rivers {{had visited}} his college {{frequently}} {{during the war}} although, having resigned his position as lecturer, he held no official post. However, upon his return from the Royal Air Force in 1919, the college created a new office for him – [...] "Praelector of Natural Science Studies" [...] – and {{he was given a}} free rein to do as he pleased. As Leonard E. Shore recalled in 1923: [...] "when I asked him if he would undertake that work... his eyes <b>shone</b> <b>with</b> a new light I had not seen before, and he paced his rooms for several minutes full of delight." [...] He took his new position to be a mandate to get to know every science student and indeed every other student at St. Johns, Cambridge, and at other colleges. He would arrange [...] "At Homes" [...] in his rooms on Sunday evenings, as well as Sunday morning breakfast meetings; he also organised informal discussions and formal lectures (many of which he gave himself) in the College Hall. He formed a group called The Socratics and brought to it some of his most influential friends, including H. G. Wells, Arnold Bennett, Bertrand Russell and Sassoon. Sassoon (Patient B in Conflict and Dream), remained particularly friendly with Rivers and regarded him as a mentor. [...] They shared Socialist sympathies.|$|E
