He becomes ambushed and cornered by the raptors, but is rescued by Eric, who managed to survive in an overturned water truck. The next day, Grant and Eric hear Paul's satellite phone ringing and are reunited with the Kirbys and Billy. Paul explains that he gave the phone to Nash before he was devoured, before the group is attacked by the Spinosaurus. After the group escapes, Grant discovers Billy took two raptor eggs to use for funding, which provoked the raptor attacks. He decides to keep the eggs to ensure the group's survival. The group unknowingly enters a large aviary used to house Pteranodons, which attack the group and fly away with Eric. Billy rescues Eric by using Ben's parasail, but is then attacked and seemingly killed by the Pteranodons. The {{rest of the group}} escapes the aviary, unintentionally leaving the door unlocked. They make their way downriver using a boat.|$|E

500|$|The novel's {{tone and}} {{structure}} place {{it within the}} serious literary tradition for which Kostova was aiming. For example, the alternating timelines are suggestive of A. S. Byatt's Possession (1990) and the intermingling of academia and the occult suggests Arturo Perez-Reverte's The Club Dumas (1993). Although many reviewers compared The Historian to Dan Brown's historical thriller The Da Vinci Code (2003), Kostova has said her book [...] "is part of a tradition where literary craft and experiments in form are all as important as action...the only overlap is this idea of people <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> in history. I'm still surprised when people make this comparison, I'm very grateful my publisher has never pushed it." [...] Moreover, the only real historical personage in her novel is Vlad Țepeș and she changed the name of some locations [...] "fearing some readers might confuse fantasy and reality, as they have with Brown's novels".|$|E
500|$|In Shakespeare's day, the Queen of England {{had her own}} Master of Revels—appointed {{to oversee}} all {{entertainment}} in London. Before a play could be performed, its script {{had to go through}} him, and whenever the Queen wanted to see a play, he would make recommendations. By 1581 (over a decade before the writing of Dream), all plays had to be approved by the Master of Revels prior to being performed. Shakespeare seems to be poking fun at the profession through Philostrate. At one point, when Theseus asks Philostrate to recommend a play to help pass the time, he lists several which sound ridiculous, such as [...] "the battle with the centaurs to be sung by an Athenian eunuch to the harp." [...] These names are humorous examples of the types of plays that were actually being performed around the time of Dream.

Doggett is informed by the local sheriff (Michael McGrady) that Mulder was there investigating a case involving Marie Hangemuhl (Natalie Radford).

While interrogating the Hangemuhls in the present, Doggett learns that Hangemuhl is suffering from terminal renal failure. As he is leaving, he also notices plastered-over gunshot holes in their wall. Later, at Mulder's apartment, Doggett finds a gun Mulder kept hidden under his sink.

Harrison adds that the song specifically espouses the message that [...] "we are not these bodies, we are in these material bodies in the physical world." [...] His friend Ravi Shankar once observed that Harrison exhibited tyagi, a trait meaning non-attachment or renunciation, a point to which Shankar added: [...] "He had everything – all the wealth, the fame, whatever he wanted.

500|$|The Silent Hill series uses {{symbolism}} and psychology; {{the town of}} Silent Hill draws upon the psyche of its visitors, ultimately creating an [...] "otherworld," [...] a twisting of reality that manifests delusions and elements of their subconscious minds, varying from character to character. Specifically, {{in the case of}} Silent Hill 2s primary player character James Sunderland, the version of the town he explores is influenced by him. Many of the monsters that roam the town symbolize his guilt, wish for punishment, for wife's three-year-long illness, and cease to exist after James comes to terms {{with the fact that he}} killed his wife Mary, partially to end her suffering and partially out of resentment and frustration. James knew she had a terminal illness, which has been speculated to be cancer, and he often read medical textbooks, <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> to help her. During her last days alive, she became physically repulsive as a result of the illness and treated James abusively, ordering him to leave one moment and begging him to comfort her the next. The knowledge of her terminal illness caused her to become angry and to hurt her loved ones, particularly James, and it pained him to visit her in the hospital. Pyramid Head functions as an executioner of Maria, a delusion of James' who strongly resembles Mary. Through Maria's repeated deaths, Pyramid Head reminds James of Mary's death and causes him to experience guilt and suffering. His appearance as an executioner stems from a picture that James saw while visiting the town three years ago with Mary.|$|E

She leaves empty-handed. Rosamunde, a fellow orphan from the Kinraide orphan home, arrives at Obernewtyn and coldly informs Elspeth that her brother Jes had discovered he also had mental abilities, but was killed by guards in an escape attempt. Rushton comforts the distraught Elspeth, and asks her why she plagues him. Fearful that someone will soon be after her as well, her group’s escape plans begin in earnest. Elspeth returns a second time to the Doctor’s office, but when Vega, Alexi and Ariel enter, she learns Ariel {{is part of the}} Obernewtyn family, and that they are searching for a Misfit to help them find the location of Beforetime weapons. Pre-warned that two Councilmen are coming to fetch her for questioning by the Herders, at nightfall she makes to escape but Rushton stops her. He reveals a secret network of drains which gets her safely to the farms. Once she is safely through the drains after a close shave with Ariel's pack of mad, wild wolves, she finds that the path to the farms has been obscured by a blizzard and gets lost. She nearly dies, but a Misfit named Domick finds her and locks her in the farmhouse to return later to Obernewtyn. Overhearing a conversation between her captors, she discovers they are Rushton's accomplices and were to secretly meet with a rebel group, but Rushton has gone missing. Convincing them that her powers can help find him, she makes her way on foot through the blizzard to the far mountains, with Maruman as her guide.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} of Imperial Bedrooms began after Ellis had re-read Less Than Zero during {{the writing of}} his 2005 pseudo-memoir, Lunar Park. The novel {{takes its name from}} Elvis Costello's 1982 album Imperial Bedroom, just as Less Than Zero had been named for a Costello single. Upon reading Zero, Ellis began to reflect on how his characters would have developed in the interim. Soon, he found himself [...] "overwhelm" [...] by the idea of what would become Imperial Bedrooms as it continually returned to him. After gestating the idea, and making [...] "voluminous notes", Ellis realised that his detailed outline had become longer than the finished book. He felt that this process of note-taking limited him to the novels that he genuinely wanted [...] "to stay with for a couple of years". To this, he attributed having [...] "written so few novels". Ellis's biggest influence in the course of writing Imperial Bedrooms was American novelist Raymond Chandler, citing his particular brand of pulpy noir fiction. He found particular inspiration in the opacity of Chandler's fiction, citing the lack of closure in some of the books, which he called [...] "existentialist masterpieces." [...] He also admired the cynical worldview that Chandler created, and his particular sense of style and mood. In terms of his own plotting, however, he opined that [...] "plots really don't matter", nor solutions to mysteries, because it's [...] "the mood that's so enthralling... kind of universal, this idea of a man <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> or moving through this moral landscape and trying to protect himself from it, and yet he's still forced to investigate it." [...] Part of the [...] "impetus" [...] behind Imperial Bedrooms, which Ellis [...] "wrestled with", was to try and dispel the [...] "sentimental" [...] view of Less Than Zero that made it, to some, [...] "an artifact of the 80s" [...] alongside [...] "John Hughes movies and Ray-Bans and Fast Times at Ridgemont High"; he felt he began assessing audience's reactions to his work when working on Lunar Park.|$|E

5000|$|In 2009, a startup {{project called}} HeyStaks (www.heystaks.com) {{developed}} {{a web browser}} plugin [...] "HayStaks". HeyStaks applies social search through collaboration in web search as a way that leads to better search results. The main motivation for HeyStaks {{to work on this}} idea is to provide the user with features that search engines didn't provide at that time. <b>For</b> instance, different <b>searches</b> have indicated that about 70% of the time when user <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>something,</b> a friend or a coworker have found it already. Also, studies have shown that approximately, 30% of people who use online <b>search,</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> that they have found before. The startup believe that they help avoid these kind of issues by providing a shared and rich search experience through a list of recommendations that get generated based on search results.|$|R

2500|$|Murakami has {{expressed}} since {{early on a}} frustration {{with the lack of}} a reliable and sustainable art market in post-war Japan. Largely for this reason, he formulated a strategy wherein he would first establish himself in the Western art world and then import himself back to Japan, building a new type of art market in the process. [...] In order to create something rooted in his own Japanese culture and history but still fresh and valid internationally, he began <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> that could be considered ‘uniquely Japanese.’ After concluding that elements of ‘high’ art were confounding at best, he began to focus on Japan’s ‘low’ culture, especially anime and manga, and the larger subculture of otaku. His artistic style and motifs (cute/disturbing anime-esque characters rendered in bright colors, flat and highly glossy surfaces, life-size sculptures of anime figurines) derived from this strategy. [...] This is demonstrated in his whimsical Cosmos Ball from 2000, {{in the collection of the}} Honolulu Museum of Art.|$|E

Wyldstyle rescues Emmett, believing him to be the Special, and takes him to meet Vitruvius in the Old West. Emmet learns that Wyldstyle and Vitruvius are [...] "Master Builders"—people capable of building anything from their imagination without the need of instructions—who oppose Business.
