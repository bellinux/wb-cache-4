5|$|A {{distinct}} {{group of}} DNA-binding proteins is the DNA-binding proteins that specifically bind <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNA.</b> In humans, replication protein A is the best-understood {{member of this}} family and is used in processes where the double helix is separated, including DNA replication, recombination, and DNA repair. These binding proteins seem to stabilize <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> and protect it from forming stem-loops or being degraded by nucleases.|$|E
5|$|In the laboratory, the {{strength}} of this interaction can be measured by finding the temperature necessary to break the hydrogen bonds, their melting temperature (also called Tm value). When all the base pairs in a DNA double helix melt, the strands separate and exist in solution as two entirely independent molecules. These <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> molecules have no single common shape, but some conformations are more stable than others.|$|E
5|$|As noted above, most DNA {{molecules}} {{are actually}} two polymer strands, bound {{together in a}} helical fashion by noncovalent bonds; this double-stranded (dsDNA) structure is maintained largely by the intrastrand base stacking interactions, which are strongest for G,C stacks. The two strands can come apart– {{a process known as}} melting– to form two <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> (ssDNA) molecules. Melting occurs at high temperature, low salt and high pH (low pH also melts DNA, but since DNA is unstable due to acid depurination, low pH is rarely used).|$|E
50|$|Strand {{displacement}} assay {{involves the}} radiolabeling of DNA duplexes. Following helicase treatment, the <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> is visually detected as {{separate from the}} double-strand DNA by non-denaturing PAGE electrophoresis. Following detection of the <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA,</b> the amount of radioactive tag {{that is on the}} <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> is quantified to give a numerical value for the amount of double-strand DNA unwinding.|$|R
40|$|Three {{forms of}} DNA {{polymerase}} alpha [DNA nucleotidyltransferase (DNA-directed), EC 2. 7. 7. 7] were partially purified from the combined nuclear extract and postmicrosomal supernatant solution of synchronized HeLa cells. These enzymes, designated DNA polymerases alpha 1, alpha 2, and alpha 3, {{on the basis}} of their order of elution from DEAE-Bio-Gel, differ in their abilities to utilize <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> templates. DNA polymerase alpha 2 has equal catalytic activities with activated and <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNAs</b> as template-primers. DNA polymerase alpha 1 has only partial catalytic activity with <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> templates, and DNA polymerase alpha 3 is essentially inactive with this template. Successive steps of hydrophobic affinity chromatography and phosphocellulose chromatography of DNA polymerase alpha 2 resolved the polymerase alpha activity and two protein factors (C 1 and C 2) that are required for its catalytic activity with a DNA template-primer that contains extended single-strand regions. In the absence of the factors, DNA polymerase alpha activity is measurable with activated but not <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> templates. In the presence of the C 1 and C 2 factors DNA polymerase alpha activity with <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> templates is restored to about 75 % of the catalytic activity of DNA polymerase alpha 2 with this template...|$|R
40|$|The {{wild-type}} strain and mutants of Haemophilus influenzae, sensitive or resistant to ultraviolet light (UV) {{as defined by}} colony-forming ability, were examined {{for their ability to}} perform the incision and rejoining steps of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) dark repair process. Although UV-induced pyrimidine dimers are excised by the wild-type Rd and a resistant mutant BC 200, the expected <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> breaks could not be detected on alkaline sucrose gradients. Repair of the gap resulting from excision must be rapid when experimental conditions described by us are employed. <b>Single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> breaks were not detected in a UV-irradiated sensitive mutant (BC 100) incapable of excising pyrimidine dimers, indicating that this mutant may be defective in a dimer-recognizing endonuclease. No <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> breaks were detected in a lysogen BC 100 (HP 1 c 1) irradiated with a UV dose large enough to induce phage development in 80 % of the cells...|$|R
5|$|At {{the ends}} of the linear {{chromosomes}} are specialized regions of DNA called telomeres. The main function of these regions is to allow the cell to replicate chromosome ends using the enzyme telomerase, as the enzymes that normally replicate DNA cannot copy the extreme 3′ ends of chromosomes. These specialized chromosome caps also help protect the DNA ends, and stop the DNA repair systems in the cell from treating them as damage to be corrected. In human cells, telomeres are usually lengths of <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> containing several thousand repeats of a simple TTAGGG sequence.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these stacked structures, telomeres also form large loop structures called telomere loops, or T-loops. Here, the <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> curls around in a long circle stabilized by telomere-binding proteins. At {{the very end of}} the T-loop, the single-stranded telomere DNA is held onto a region of double-stranded DNA by the telomere strand disrupting the double-helical DNA and base pairing to one of the two strands. This triple-stranded structure is called a displacement loop or D-loop.|$|E
5|$|Archaea can be {{infected}} by double-stranded DNA viruses that are unrelated {{to any other}} form of virus and have a variety of unusual shapes, including bottles, hooked rods, or teardrops. These viruses have been studied in most detail in thermophilics, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Two groups of <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> viruses that infect archaea have been recently isolated. One group is exemplified by the Halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1 ("Pleolipoviridae") infecting halophilic archaea and the other one by the Aeropyrum coil-shaped virus ("Spiraviridae") infecting a hyperthermophilic (optimal growth at 90–95°C) host. Notably, the latter virus has the largest currently reported ssDNA genome. Defenses against these viruses may involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences that are related to the genes of the viruses.|$|E
25|$|The DNAFET (DNA field-effect transistor) is a {{specialized}} FET {{that acts as}} a biosensor, by using a gate made of <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> molecules to detect matching DNA strands.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIs <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> translatable? Since the 60 s, the {{question}} still remains {{whether or not}} DNA could be directly translated into protein. Some discrepancies in the results were reported about functional translation of <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> but all results converged on a similar behavior of RNA and ssDNA in the initiation step. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry method {{was used to determine}} thermodynamic constants of interaction between <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> and S 30 extract of Escherichia coli. Our results showed that the binding was not affected {{by the nature of the}} template tested and the dissociation constants were in the same range when ssDNA (K(d) = 3. 62 +/- 2. 1 x 10 (- 8) M) or the RNA corresponding sequence (K(d) = 2. 7 +/- 0. 82 x 10 (- 8) M) bearing SD/ATG sequences were used. The binding specificity was confirmed by antibiotic interferences which block the initiation complex formation. These results suggest that the limiting step in translation of ssDNA is the elongation process...|$|R
50|$|Telomere-binding {{proteins}} are {{proteins that}} mediate telomere function by binding to them. There {{are two types}} of telomere-binding proteins: <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> telomere binding proteins and double-strand DNA telomere binding proteins.|$|R
5|$|Morpholinos are {{synthetic}} {{molecules that}} {{are the product of}} a redesign of natural nucleic acid structure. Usually 25 bases in length, they bind to complementary sequences of RNA or <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> by standard nucleic acid base-pairing. In terms of structure, the difference between Morpholinos and DNA is that, while Morpholinos have standard nucleic acid bases, those bases are bound to morpholine rings linked through phosphorodiamidate groups instead of phosphates. The figure compares the structures of the two strands depicted there, one of RNA and the other of a Morpholino. Replacement of anionic phosphates with the uncharged phosphorodiamidate groups eliminates ionization in the usual physiological pH range, so Morpholinos in organisms or cells are uncharged molecules. The entire backbone of a Morpholino is made from these modified subunits.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{cellular}} signals activating the SOS response are regions of <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> (ssDNA), arising from stalled replication forks or double-strand breaks, which are processed by DNA helicase {{to separate the}} two DNA strands. In the initiation step, RecA protein binds to ssDNA in an ATP hydrolysis driven reaction creating RecA–ssDNA filaments. RecA–ssDNA filaments activate LexA autoprotease activity, which ultimately leads to cleavage of LexA dimer and subsequent LexA degradation. The loss of LexA repressor induces transcription of the SOS genes and allows for further signal induction, inhibition of cell division {{and an increase in}} levels of proteins responsible for damage processing.|$|E
5|$|To {{obtain the}} desired oligonucleotide, the {{building}} blocks are sequentially coupled to the growing oligonucleotide chain in the order required by the sequence of the product (see Synthetic cycle below). The process has been fully automated since the late 1970s. Upon {{the completion of the}} chain assembly, the product is released from the solid phase to solution, deprotected, and collected. The occurrence of side reactions sets practical limits for the length of synthetic oligonucleotides (up to about 200 nucleotide residues) because the number of errors accumulates with the length of the oligonucleotide being synthesized. Products are often isolated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to obtain the desired oligonucleotides in high purity. Typically, synthetic oligonucleotides are <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> or RNA molecules around 15–25 bases in length.|$|E
50|$|DNA topoisomerases {{are divided}} into two classes: type I enzymes (EC; topoisomerases I, III and V) break <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA,</b> and type II enzymes (EC; topoisomerases II, IV and VI) break double-strand DNA.|$|R
50|$|The <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> (ssDNA) {{template}} is hybridized to a sequencing primer and incubated {{with the}} enzymes DNA polymerase, ATP sulfurylase, luciferase and apyrase, {{and with the}} substrates adenosine 5´ phosphosulfate (APS) and luciferin.|$|R
40|$|The major DNA repair {{pathways}} {{operate on}} damage in double-strand DNA because {{they use the}} intact strand as a template after damage removal. Therefore, lesions in transient single-strand stretches of chromosomal DNA {{are expected to be}} especially threatening to genome stability. To test this hypothesis, we designed systems in budding yeast that could generate many kilobases of persistent <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> next to double-strand breaks or uncapped telomeres. The systems allowed controlled restoration to the double-strand state after applying DNA damage. We found that lesions induced by UV-light and methyl methanesulfonate can be tolerated in long single-strand regions and are hypermutagenic. The hypermutability required PCNA monoubiquitination and was largely attributable to translesion synthesis by the error-prone DNA polymerase f. In support of multiple lesions in <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> being a source of hypermutability, analysis of the UV-induced mutants revealed strong strand-specific bias and unexpectedly high frequency of alleles with widely separated multiple mutations scattered over several kilobases. Hypermutability and multiple mutations associated with lesions in transient stretches of long <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> may be a source of carcinogenesis and provide selective advantage in adaptive evolution...|$|R
5|$|In Escherichia coli, SOS {{boxes are}} 20-nucleotide long {{sequences}} near promoters with palindromic structure {{and a high}} degree of sequence conservation. In other classes and phyla, the sequence of SOS boxes varies considerably, with different length and composition, but it is always highly conserved and one of the strongest short signals in the genome. The high information content of SOS boxes permits differential binding of LexA to different promoters and allows for timing of the SOS response. The lesion repair genes are induced at the beginning of SOS response. The error-prone translesion polymerases, for example, UmuCD'2 (also called DNA polymerase V), are induced later on as a last resort. Once the DNA damage is repaired or bypassed using polymerases or through recombination, the amount of <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> in cells is decreased, lowering the amounts of RecA filaments decreases cleavage activity of LexA homodimer, which then binds to the SOS boxes near promoters and restores normal gene expression.|$|E
5|$|For most viruses with RNA genomes {{and some}} with <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> genomes, the single strands {{are said to}} be either positive-sense (called the plus-strand) or negative-sense (called the minus-strand), {{depending}} on if they are complementary to the viral messenger RNA (mRNA). Positive-sense viral RNA is in the same sense as viral mRNA and thus at least a part of it can be immediately translated by the host cell. Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase before translation. DNA nomenclature for viruses with single-sense genomic ssDNA is similar to RNA nomenclature, in that the template strand for the viral mRNA is complementary to it (−), and the coding strand is a copy of it (+). However, several types of ssDNA and ssRNA viruses have genomes that are ambisense in that transcription can occur off both strands in a double-stranded replicative intermediate. Examples include geminiviruses, which are ssDNA plant viruses and arenaviruses, which are ssRNA viruses of animals.|$|E
25|$|Exposing intact yeast {{cells to}} alkali cations {{such as those}} of cesium or lithium allows the cells to take up plasmid DNA. Later {{protocols}} adapted this transformation method, using lithium acetate, polyethylene glycol, and <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNA.</b> In these protocols, the <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> preferentially binds to the yeast cell wall, preventing plasmid DNA from doing so and leaving it available for transformation.|$|E
50|$|Another {{approach}} uses {{measurements of}} the electrical tunnelling currents across <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> as it moves through a channel. Depending on its electronic structure, each base affects the tunnelling current differently, allowing differentiation between different bases.|$|R
25|$|In photon therapy, {{most of the}} {{radiation}} effect is through free radicals. Cells have mechanisms for repairing <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> damage and double-stranded DNA damage. However, double-stranded DNA breaks are {{much more difficult to}} repair, and can lead to dramatic chromosomal abnormalities and genetic deletions. Targeting double-stranded breaks increases the probability that cells will undergo cell death. Cancer cells are generally less differentiated and more stem cell-like; they reproduce more than most healthy differentiated cells, and have a diminished ability to repair sub-lethal damage. <b>Single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> damage is then passed on through cell division; damage to the cancer cells' DNA accumulates, causing them to die or reproduce more slowly.|$|R
50|$|Double-strand break (DSB) repair by {{homologous}} recombination is initiated by 5' to 3' strand resection (DSB resection). In humans, the DNA2 nuclease cuts back the 5'-to-3' strand at the DSB {{to generate a}} 3' <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> overhang strand.|$|R
25|$|TERT is {{a reverse}} transcriptase, {{which is a}} class of enzyme that creates <b>{{single-stranded}}</b> <b>DNA</b> using single-stranded RNA as a template.|$|E
25|$|ATR is {{involved}} in arresting the cell cycle in response to DNA double-stranded breaks. ATR has an obligate checkpoint partner, ATR-interacting-protein (ATRIP), and together these two proteins are responsive to stretches of <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> that are coated by replication protein A (RPA). The formation of <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> occurs frequently, more often during replication stress. ATR-ATRIP is able to arrest the cell cycle to preserve genome integrity. ATR is found on chromatin during S phase, similar to RPA and claspin.|$|E
25|$|Circoviruses {{are small}} <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> viruses. There are to genera: gyrovirus, with one species called chicken anemia virus; and circovirus, which {{includes}} porcine circovirus types 1 and 2, psittacine beak and feather disease virus, pigeon circovirus, canary circovirus goose circovirus.|$|E
40|$|Fullerene {{moieties}} {{are attached}} to <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> and the pH-induced conformational changes are evaluated in detail. It is found that fullerene attachments significantly enhance the machine performance of the DNA strand by stabilization of internal structure through intramolecular hydrophobic interactions...|$|R
40|$|Numerous genes contain {{promoter}} {{elements that}} are nuclease hypersensitive. These elements frequently possess polypurine/polypyrimidine stretches and are usually associated with altered chromatin structure. We have previously isolated a clone that binds a class of CT-rich promoter elements. We have further characterized this clone, termed the nuclease-sensitive element protein- 1, or NSEP- 1. NSEP- 1 binds both duplex CT elements and the CT-rich strand of these elements in a 'generic' sequence specific manner and has overlapping but distinct single-and double-strand DNA binding domains. The minimal peptide region sufficient for both duplex and <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> binding includes two regions rich in basic amino acids flanking an RNP-CS- 1 like octapeptide motif. Deletion analysis shows that the <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> binding activity is mediated by the RNP-CS- 1 like octapeptide motif and is the key peptide region necessary for single-strand binding. NSEP- 1 's affinity for CT rich promoter elements with strand asymmetry {{in addition to its}} double- and <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> binding properties suggests that it may be a member of a class of DNA binding proteins that modulate gene expression by their ability to recognize DNA with unusual secondary structure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This work {{represents}} active DNA {{concentration on}} piezoresistive microcantilever using biased AC electroosmosis. Two different sizes of DNA molecules, -phage DNA (48. 5 kbp) and <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> of 20 nucleotides are concentrated on separate piezoresistive microcantilever sen-sor for detection. Before concentration, mixing of DNAmolecules {{is performed using}} the same device for efficient concentration. During concentration of DNA molecules, biased and unbiased AC elec-troosmosis are needed to concentrate <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> and -phage DNA, respectively. Moreover, dielectrophoresis is induced by biased AC electroosmosis that can generate attractive force to transport negatively charged single-strandDNA. This paper represents a device configuration to integrate biased and unbiased AC electroosmosis and dielectrophoresis with piezoresistive microcantilever sensors {{for the detection of}} -phage <b>DNA</b> and <b>single-strand</b> DN...|$|R
25|$|Minichromosome {{maintenance}} proteins {{have been}} found to be required for DNA helicase activity and inactivation of any of the six Mcm proteins prevents further progression of the replication fork. This is consistent with the requirement of ORC, Cdc6, and Cdt1 function to assemble the Mcm proteins at the origin of replication. The complex containing all six Mcm proteins creates a hexameric, doughnut like structure with a central cavity. The helicase activity of the Mcm protein complex raises the question of how the ring-like complex is loaded onto the <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNA.</b> One possibility is that the helicase activity of the Mcm protein complex can oscillate between an open and a closed ring formation to allow <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> loading.|$|E
25|$|Bare <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> {{tends to}} fold back on itself forming {{secondary}} structures; these structures {{can interfere with}} the movement of DNA polymerase. To prevent this, single-strand binding proteins bind to the DNA until a second strand is synthesized, preventing secondary structure formation.|$|E
25|$|Several {{models have}} been {{proposed}} for binding of ERCC1–XPF to DNA, based on partial structures of relevant protein fragments at atomic resolution. DNA binding mediated by the helix-hairpin-helix domains of ERCC1 and XPF domains positions the heterodimer at the junction between double-stranded and <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNA.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Helicase polarity, {{which is}} also deemed [...] "{{direction}}ality", {{is defined as the}} direction (characterized as 5'→3' or 3'→5') of helicase movement on the DNA/RNA single-strand along which it is moving. This determination of polarity is vital in f.ex. determining whether the tested helicase attaches to the DNA leading strand, or the DNA lagging strand. To characterize this helicase feature, a partially duplex DNA is used as the substrate that has a central <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> region with different lengths of duplex regions of DNA (one short region that runs 5'→3' and one longer region that runs 3'→5') {{on both sides of this}} region. Once the helicase is added to that central single-strand region, the polarity is determined by characterization on the newly formed <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA.</b>|$|R
40|$|Meiotic {{recombination}} is {{a mandatory}} process for sexual reproduction. We identified a protein specifically implicated in meiotic homologous recombination that we named: meiosis specific with OB domain (MEIOB). This protein is conserved among metazoan species and contains <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> binding sites {{similar to those}} of RPA 1. Our studies in vitro revealed that both recombinant and endogenous MEIOB can be retained on <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA.</b> Those in vivo demonstrated the specific expression of Meiob in early meiotic germ cells and the co-localization of MEIOB protein with RPA on chromosome axes. MEIOB localization in Dmc 1 (-/-) spermatocytes indicated that it accumulates on resected DNA. Homologous Meiob deletion in mice caused infertility in both sexes, due to a meiotic arrest at a zygotene/pachytene-like stage. DNA double strand break repair and homologous chromosome synapsis were impaired in Meiob (-/-) meiocytes. Interestingly MEIOB appeared to be dispensable for the initial loading of recombinases but was required to maintain a proper number of RAD 51 and DMC 1 foci beyond the zygotene stage. In light of these findings, we propose that RPA and this new <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> binding protein MEIOB, are essential to ensure the proper stabilization of recombinases which is required for successful homology search and meiotic recombination...|$|R
40|$|In Escherichia coli, the single-strand DNA-binding protein (SSB) is {{required}} for DNA replication. A mutation of the ssb gene, lexC 113, imparts to the cells UV sensitivity and inability to induce lambda prophage and to amplify recA protein, indicating participation of SSB in DNA repair and viral induction processes. We report the effect of purified SSB, isolated from wild-type and lexC 113 strains, on the recA-mediated proteolysis of lambda repressor in vitro. (i) These proteins abolished the inhibition produced by excess <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> and (ii) {{in the presence of}} the binding proteins, the apparent stoichiometry [...] 1 monomer of recA to 6 nucleotides of <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> [Craig, N. L. & Roberts, J. W. (1980) Nature (London) 283, 26 - 30] was no longer observed. (iii) At the optimal concentration [...] 1 protein monomer to 8 nucleotides [...] they increased the rate and extent of repressor cleavage at all <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> concentrations, including that observed at the apparent optimal DNA concentration. (iv) At binding protein/nucleotide ratios greater than or equal to 1 : 3, SSB from lexC 113 inhibited repressor cleavage while that from wild type did not. (v) These results are consistent with the notion that SSB is probably involved in the induction of prophages in vivo...|$|R
