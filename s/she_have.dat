25|$|While the {{possibility}} that certain individuals may be born with musical deficits {{is not a new}} notion, the first documented case of congenital amusia was published relatively recently.

25|$|On 30 July, {{after several}} BWCC inmates and staff {{expressed}} concerns about Anna's welfare, the prison's psychologist recommended that <b>she</b> <b>have</b> a psychiatric evaluation, {{so that her}} mental health could be assessed.
