5|$|Domestication of {{the horse}} most likely took place in central Asia prior to 3500 BC. Two major sources of {{information}} are used to determine where and when the horse was first domesticated and how the domesticated horse <b>spread</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world. The first source is based on palaeological and archaeological discoveries; the second source is a comparison of DNA obtained from modern horses to that from bones and teeth of ancient horse remains.|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{are valued}} as food by humans and also have many {{cultural}} roles in literature, symbolism and religion. Frog populations have declined significantly since the 1950s. More than {{one third of}} species {{are considered to be}} threatened with extinction and over one hundred and twenty are believed to have become extinct since the 1980s. The number of malformations among frogs is on the rise and an emerging fungal disease, chytridiomycosis, has <b>spread</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world. Conservation biologists are working to understand the causes of these problems and to resolve them.|$|E

5|$|Recorded {{popular music}} {{began in the}} late 19th century, with {{international}} styles influencing Italian music by the late 1910s; however, the rise of autarchia, the Fascist policy of cultural isolationism in 1922 led to a retreat from international popular music. During this period, popular Italian musicians traveled abroad and learned elements of jazz, Latin American music and other styles. These musics influenced the Italian tradition, which <b>spread</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world and further diversified following liberalization after World War II.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of an activity into a sport {{and then an}} entertainment is also affected by the local climate and conditions. For example, the modern sport of surfing is associated with Hawaii and that of snow skiing probably evolved in Scandinavia. While these sports and the entertainment they offer to spectators have <b>spread</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world, people in the two originating countries remain well known for their prowess. Sometimes the climate offers a chance to adapt another sport {{such as in the}} case of ice hockey—an important entertainment in Canada.|$|E

5|$|After {{deciding}} not {{to renew}} the lease on the Four Acres, Albion moved to their fifth ground, Stoney Lane, {{in time for the}} 1885–86 season. The ground was located close to the Plough and Harrow public house, which served as the club's headquarters at the time. Albion took out an initial seven-year lease on the Stoney Lane site, paying an annual rent of £28 to its owner, a local undertaker named Mr Webb. The pitch was returfed and levelled, with ashes <b>spread</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> perimeter, and a wooden grandstand was built that {{came to be known as}} 'Noah's Ark'. The ground cost £370 to build, a sum that was offset by a number of friendly matches that took place early in the season.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians have a {{juvenile}} stage and an adult stage, and the circulatory {{systems of the}} two are distinct. In the juvenile (or tadpole) stage, the circulation {{is similar to that}} of a fish; the two-chambered heart pumps the blood through the gills where it is oxygenated, and is <b>spread</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> body and back to the heart in a single loop. In the adult stage, amphibians (especially frogs) lose their gills and develop lungs. They have a heart that consists of a single ventricle and two atria. When the ventricle starts contracting, deoxygenated blood is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs. Continued contraction then pumps oxygenated blood around the rest of the body. Mixing of the two bloodstreams is minimized by the anatomy of the chambers.|$|E
5|$|Bloodless {{heart surgery}} was pioneered by American surgeon Denton Cooley. It was also {{performed}} by doctor Jerome Kay in Los Angeles and the procedure soon <b>spread</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world. Panday, who trained under the Canadian surgeon Wilfred Gordon Bigelow, adopted the technique and tailored it to Indian conditions. He performed bloodless open heart surgeries at KEM in the 1970s and 1980s. Bloodless heart surgery was cost-effective in India, {{as it did}} not require blood transfusions, reduced the chances of infection in case of infected blood, and further reduced postoperative costs. Bloodless heart surgery was also performed on Jehovah's Witnesses, as they refused donated blood.|$|E

5|$|Following its {{foundation}} in the United Kingdom, Scouting <b>spread</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> globe. The first association outside the British Empire {{was founded in}} Chile in May 21, 1909 after a visit to Baden Powell. In most countries of the world, there is now at least one Scouting (or Guiding) organization. Each is independent, but international cooperation continues {{to be seen as}} part of the Scout Movement. In 1922 the WOSM started as the governing body on policy for the national Scouting organizations (then male only). In addition to being the governing policy body, it organizes the World Scout Jamboree every four years.|$|E
5|$|Metro: Last Light {{takes place}} in 2034, {{one year after the}} events of Metro 2033, {{following}} the ending of the original novel in which Artyom's missile strike against the Dark Ones — mysterious beings that seemingly threatened the survivors of a nuclear war living in the Moscow Metro — occurred. The Rangers, a neutral peacekeeping force that operates throughout the system, have since occupied the D6 military facility Artyom visited during the first game. This is a huge, and not fully explored pre-war bunker, and Artyom, now a Ranger himself, remains unsure whether killing the Dark Ones was the correct decision. Rumors of D6's discovery, and its great riches, have <b>spread</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Metro; rival factions, such as the Communist Red Line and Nazi Fourth Reich, hope to seize the bunker and its contents.|$|E
5|$|This {{increased}} severity {{has been}} attributed to the circumstances of the First World War. In civilian life, natural selection favours a mild strain. Those who get very ill stay home, and those mildly ill continue with their lives, preferentially spreading the mild strain. In the trenches, natural selection was reversed. Soldiers with a mild strain stayed where they were, while the severely ill were sent on crowded trains to crowded field hospitals, spreading the deadlier virus. The second wave began and the flu quickly <b>spread</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world again. Consequently, during modern pandemics health officials pay attention when the virus reaches places with social upheaval (looking for deadlier strains of the virus).|$|E

5|$|Word about Barrymore's {{problems}} {{on and off}} the set <b>spread</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> industry, and he did not work on another film for over a year, when he had a supporting role in the musical film Maytime. His divorce from Costello was finalized in October 1936, and he married Barrie in November the same year. The couple had a heated argument in public shortly afterwards, and he again spent time in Kelley's Rest Home and hospital, which cost him an average of $800 daily, draining his finances. When he came out, he collapsed on the Maytime set. On January 15, 1937, he was served with divorce papers, and a month later he filed for bankruptcy protection, with debts of $160,000. The divorce was granted in April, but the couple reconciled before it was finalized.|$|E

As the virus spread, it affected not only humans, but other animals as well, and the environment deteriorated, turning cities into desolate landscapes and the wilderness into wastelands. The real Alice (from whom the clones are made) wanders the wastelands of the Southwestern U.S. She responds to a group asking for help on the radio. It turns out that they are bandits who first attempt to rape her and then have her killed by infected dogs, only for her to unleash them unto her captors. On her travels, she finds a dead man's diary which states that there is an uninfected area in Alaska.|$|E
5|$|When {{a key to}} {{a room at the}} Marina View Hotel is {{delivered}} inside a jar of blood to the Homicide Department, Sgt. James Doakes (Erik King) and Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter) visit the hotel, where they find a room completely covered in blood. Dexter is sent in first to investigate, but seeing the blood-covered room brings back a repressed memory from his childhood— Dexter at the age of three years sitting in a pool of blood—and he collapses and runs from the room. The forensics team surmises that the blood in the hotel room came from at least five different bodies, although none were in the room. Since there were only one set of footprints in the room, they assume that the victims were killed elsewhere and their blood <b>spread</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room by the killer. Debra suggests that the Ice Truck Killer, who had five bloodless victims, may have been responsible.|$|E

5|$|While single {{passenger}} cars were sometimes {{moved around the}} system, either between depots or to Acton Works, these movements were infrequent, {{and when they were}} necessary, standard stock motor cars borrowed from the passenger fleet were normally used. Following the introduction of the 1959 passenger stock, single cars and parts of units were moved around much more frequently, and normal passenger motor cars could not be used to perform this task, as the equipment they needed to operate was <b>spread</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> unit, rather than confined to the motor car. Eight Standard Stock motor cars, dating from 1927 and 1934, were therefore allocated as pilot motor cars. In 1967, they were painted maroon, numbered L130 to L137, and became part of the ballast motor fleet. Four were withdrawn in 1971 without performing this work, however. Following withdrawal, L137 was shipped to the Isle of Wight, to replace a car on the Island Line which had been damaged. The remaining four cars worked as two pairs, and were still working as pilot motor cars in 1987, but had been withdrawn by 1993.|$|E
5|$|News of the {{invasion}} quickly <b>spread</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world via ambassadors and correspondents in Korea. Journalists in the United States were reporting on {{the invasion}} within five hours of the initial attack, and United States Ambassador to Korea John J. Muccio sent a telegram to the US State Department at 21:26 EST (10:26 KST) June 24. As the combat grew more intense, US Secretary of State Dean Acheson informed US President Harry S. Truman (who had been resting {{at his home in}} Independence, Missouri for the weekend), and Secretary-General of the United Nations Trygve Lie of the situation. The attack was particularly troubling to Truman, who likened it to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and to Lie, who was reminded of the Invasion of Norway during World War II. Fearing the attack would spur a World War III, Truman resolved to act as quickly as possible to prevent an escalation of the conflict. Muccio met with Rhee, who informed him the South Korean Army would run out of ammunition within ten days, and {{would not be able to}} hold back the invasion on its own. He requested the United Nations and the United States assist South Korea in the conflict.|$|E
5|$|On Friday 9 November, prostitute Mary Jane Kelly {{was murdered}} in the single room where she lived at 13 Miller's Court, behind 26 Dorset Street, Spitalfields. One of the earlier victims, Chapman, had lived in Dorset Street, and another, Eddowes, was {{reported}} to have slept rough there. Kelly's severely mutilated body was discovered shortly after 10:45am lying on the bed. The first doctor at the scene, Dr George Bagster Phillips, believed that Kelly was killed by a slash to the throat. After her death, her abdominal cavity was sliced open and all her viscera removed and <b>spread</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room. Her breasts had been cut off, her face mutilated beyond recognition, and her thighs partially cut through to the bone, with some of the muscles removed. Unlike the other victims, she was undressed and wore only a light chemise. Her clothes were folded neatly on a chair, with the exception of some found burnt in the grate. Abberline thought the clothes had been burned by the murderer to provide light, as the room was otherwise only dimly lit by a single candle. Kelly's murder was the most savage, probably because the murderer had more time to commit his atrocities in a private room rather than in the street. Her state of undress and folded clothes have led to suggestions that she undressed herself before lying down on the bed, which would indicate that she was killed by someone she knew, by someone she believed to be a client, or when she was asleep or intoxicated.|$|E
