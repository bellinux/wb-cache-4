60|$|If I {{had waited}} a little till I had {{got into the}} {{beautiful}} Derbyshire country which lies, or rather rolls, between Manchester and Sheffield, I could as easily have got rid of my epoch in the smiling agricultural landscape. I do not know just {{the measure of the}} Black Country in England, or where Sheffield begins to be perhaps the blackest spot in it; but I am sure that nothing not <b>surgically</b> <b>clean</b> could be whiter than the roads that, almost as soon as we were free of Manchester, began to climb the green, thickly wooded hills, and dip into the grassy and leafy valleys. In {{the very heart of the}} loveliness we found Sheffield most nobly posed against a lurid sunset, and clouding the sky, which can never be certain of being blue, with the smoke of a thousand towering chimneys. From whatever point you have it, the sight is most prodigious, but no doubt the subjective sense of the great ducal mansions and estates which neighbor the mirky metropolis of steel and iron has its part in heightening the dramatic effect.|$|E
3000|$|The {{dental pulp}} may be removed without causing {{irreparable}} {{damage to the}} periapical tissues, provided the following definite plan of operation is carried out: a) <b>surgically</b> <b>clean</b> technic b) use of only mild antiseptics, all caustics being eliminated; c) avoidance of injury to soft tissue in the apical foramina; d) removal of all true pulp tissue; (and) e) filling of the canal with a bland, non-irritating, non-absorbable filling material to {{near the site of}} amputation.|$|E
40|$|Patients with {{uncomplicated}} skin lacerations {{who attended}} a rural family-practice clinic {{were randomly assigned to}} have their cut repaired using either full sterile technique or a surgically-clean technique. No significant differences were found in the rate of healing or in the incidence of complications. It was concluded that full sterile technique is not needed to repair simple skin lacerations, and that to suture the lacerations using a <b>surgically</b> <b>clean</b> technique would save both time and money...|$|E
30|$|We used {{ultrasound}} [12, 13] for {{cases where}} control X-rays did not clearly show {{the presence of}} a regenerate column. This permitted earlier identification of the initial ossification before its presence could be detected by X-ray. At the end of transport, the contact point (docking site) was <b>surgically</b> <b>cleaned,</b> interposed tissue removed and, if small residual gaps were seen between the two bone ends, cancellous bone taken from the ipsilateral iliac crest and grafted. In 4 femurs, due to lack of consolidation and ossification of the regenerate column, we replaced the fixator with a intramedullary nail.|$|R
50|$|Some hematomas {{are visible}} {{under the surface}} of the skin (commonly called bruises) or {{possibly}} felt as masses/lumps. Lumps may be caused by the limitation of the blood to a sac, subcutaneous or intramuscular tissue space isolated by fascial planes. This is a key anatomical feature that helps prevent injuries from causing massive blood loss. In most cases the hematoma such as a sac of blood eventually dissolves; however, in some cases they may continue to grow such as due to blood seepage or show no change. If the sac of blood does not disappear, then it may need to be <b>surgically</b> <b>cleaned</b> out/repaired.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe present dataset {{describes}} a detailed protocol to isolate mesenchymal cells from human fat {{without the use}} of collagenase. Human fat specimen, <b>surgically</b> <b>cleaned</b> from non-fat tissues (e. g., blood vessels) and reduced into smaller fat pieces of around 1 – 3 mm size, is incubated in complete culture media for five to seven days. Then, cells started to spread out from the fat explants and to grow in cultures according to an exponential pattern. Our data showed that primary mesenchymal cells presenting heterogeneous morphology start to acquire more homogenous fibroblastic-like shape when cultured for longer duration or when subcultured into new flasks. Cell isolation efficiency as well as cell doubling time were also calculated throughout the culturing experimentations and illustrated in a separate figure thereafter. This paper contains data previously considered as an alternative protocol to isolate adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell published in “Proliferation and differentiation of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) into osteoblastic lineage are passage dependent” [1]...|$|R
40|$|Most gunshot {{injuries}} to the hand involve {{a combination of}} tissue types. The goal {{of this study is}} to report the results of early definitive treatment in extra-articular metacarpal and proximal phalangeal fractures due to low velocity gunshot wounds and to analyse their outcomes. A retrospective analysis of 51 metacarpal and 41 proximal phalangeal fractures of 76 patients due to low velocity gunshot wounds treated between January 2001 and December 2004 was carried out. We applied acute fixation in the first 24  hours. The patients were evaluated with total active motion scores, radiographic control, complication rate and the need for revision surgery. The infection frequency was 10. 5 % and the need for a revision surgery was 7 %. The plate fixation group had significantly higher total active motion scores than the external fixation group. The K wire group had the highest revision rate. The bone grafting group was associated with good total active motion scores and low complication rates. The majority of the low velocity gunshot injuries are <b>surgically</b> <b>clean</b> wounds which allow not only early fracture fixation, but also early bone grafting and soft tissue reconstruction. Plate and screw fixation is associated with significantly better functional outcomes than the minimal fixation group...|$|E
40|$|Aural {{haematoma}} {{is treated}} either by surgical or by conservative treatment. Both techniques usually require several interventions and re-checks. A new operation technique has been evaluated that requires {{only a single}} procedure but is {{as effective as the}} techniques used previously. The haematoma is opened, <b>cleaned</b> <b>surgically</b> and the two layers of the auricular cartilage are appositioned inside with several suture lines placed {{on both sides of the}} incision, alternating the sides approaching to the sagittal cavity. None of the suture lines is stitched through the auricle completely as they all run intradermally on the side of the haematoma and to the cartilage on the other side. Twenty-three dogs with aural haematoma were treated between 2006 and 2012. In 21 (91 %) of them, the haematoma healed without any auricle deformity. No secondary intervention was necessary in any of the cases. None of the 23 animals experienced a relapse during follow-up. The new method offers a minor risk of postoperative complications while accomplishing high healing rates...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the changes in elasticity and lattice structure in leg bone of rats which were: 1) under Hind-Limb Suspension (HLS) by tail for 2 weeks and 2) exposed to a total radiation of 10 Grays in 10 days. The animals were sacrificed at the end of 2 weeks and the leg bones were <b>surgically</b> removed, <b>cleaned</b> and fixed with a buffered solution. The mechanical strength of the bone (elastic modulus) was determined from measurement of bending of a bone when under an applied force. Two methodologies were used: i) a 3 -point bending technique and ii) classical bending where bending is accomplished keeping one end fixed. Three point bending method used a captive actuator controlled by a programmable IDEA drive. This allowed incremental steps of 0. 047 mm for which the force is measured. The data is used to calculate the stress and the strain. In the second method a mirror attached to the free end of the bone allowed a reflected laser beam spot to be tracked. This provided the displacement measurement as stress levels changed. Analysis of stress vs. strain graph together with solution of Euler-Bernoulli equation for a cantilever beam allowed determination of the elastic modulus of the leg bone for (i) control samples, (ii) HLS samples and (iii) HLS samples with radiation effects. To ascertain changes in the bone lattice structure, the bones were cross-sectioned and imaged with a 20 keV beam of electrons in a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). A backscattered detector and a secondary electron detector in the SEM provided the images from well-defined parts of the leg bones. Elemental compositions in combination with mechanical properties (elastic modulus and lattice structure) changes indicated weakening of the bones under space-like conditions of microgravity and radiation...|$|R
