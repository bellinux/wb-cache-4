40|$|Reading depends {{heavily on}} the {{efficient}} shift of attention. Mounting evidence has suggested that dyslexics have deficits in covert attentional shift. However, it remains unclear whether dyslexics also have deficits in overt attentional shift. With the majority of relevant studies carried out in alphabetic writing systems, it is also unknown whether the attentional deficits observed in dyslexics are restricted to a particular writing system. The present study examined inhibition of return (IOR) —a major driving force of attentional <b>shifts—in</b> dyslexic children learning to read a logographic script (i. e., Chinese). Robust IOR effects were observed in both covert and overt attentional tasks in two groups of typically developing children, who were age- or reading ability-matched to the dyslexic children. In contrast, the dyslexic children showed IOR in the overt {{but not in the}} covert attentional task. We conclude that covert attentional shift is selectively impaired in dyslexic children. This impairment is not restricted to alphabetic writing systems, and it could be a significant contributor to the difficulties encountered by children learning to read. 17 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The oft-projected {{vision for}} the twenty-first century is that of an {{information}} society. Not only has the new era understood the importance of information but perhaps {{for the first time in}} the history of mankind, it has the means to use it to further human progress and prosperity. Information helps policymakers anticipate unprecedented events- even revolutions, like the constantly accelerating microelectronics revolution. At the same time, it helps gauge their impact on social and economic development, governance and the civil society. And, the more the information technology (IT) advances the easier all this becomes. Information technology concerns the techniques and skills for the production and distribution of knowledge to accomplish human progress. This technology is used by the information society in the same way as an agricultural society consumes raw materials and the industrial society energy. But IT goes beyond that. It transforms the production processes of other industries as well. Precisely because of this, IT holds the potential to alter the values of business, education, health care, governance, civic participation and social interaction. The emerging complexity and scale of social and economic systems created by information technology mark a series of power <b>shifts-in</b> theoretical knowledge, methodological techniques, institutions, actors and processes. The construction of information highways has made it possible to connect the different parts of the world through cables, satellites and computer technology and speeded up international communication, travels, digitized commerce and facilitated service delivery. The consequences are also political as IT has dramatically increased interdependence among peoples and nations. As a result, openness in political decision-making is not just a rhetoric but a compulsion forced by the state of today’s information technology which has thus influenced the very functioning of governing institutions. Obviously, new information tools are extremely useful to journalists for finding facts, making them familiar with new events and developing methods of analysis and investigation, not to mention providing independence of mind...|$|R

In this paper, we develop a methodology to suppress the test power to avoid chip failures caused by large test power, and our methodology is also effective in reducing the test data volume and <b>shift-in</b> power. The proposed schemes and techniques are based on the selective test pattern compression, they can reduce considerable <b>shift-in</b> power by skipping the switching signal passing through long scan chains.

However, in scan testing, untestable faults may be detected through scan chains. Detected untestable faults cause overtesting. Untestable faults consist of uncontrollable faults, unobservable faults, and uncontrollable and unobservable faults. Uncontrollable faults may be detected under invalid states through scan chains by <b>shift-in</b> operations. Unobservable faults cannot be observed at primary outputs, but their effects may be propagated to scan flip-flops. Thus, unobservable faults may be detected through scan chains by shift-out operations. Several methods {{to reduce the number of}} detected untestable faults were recently proposed. These methods identify invalid states and generate test patterns avoiding invalid states. As the result, the number of detected uncontrollable faults was reduced. However, they cannot reduce the number of detected unobservable faults. In this paper, both uncontrollable and unobservable faults are identified using a multi-cycle capture test generation method. We evaluate the relationship between the numbers of untestable faults and the number of time expansions for ISCAS’ 89 benchmark circuits, and also evaluate factors that untestable faults are identified...|$|E

Particularly, during at-speed testing, excessive power consumed during the Launch-To-Capture (LTC) cycle causes serious issues {{that may lead}} to the overkill of defect-free logic ICs. Many successful test generation approaches to reduce IR-drop and/or power supply noise during LTC for the launch-off capture (LOC) scheme have previously been proposed, and several of X-filling techniques have proven especially effective.

In this work, we propose a novel X-filling technique for the LOS scheme, called Adjacent-Probability-based X-Filling (AP-fill), which can reduce more LTC power than adjacent-fill.

40|$|In {{the sociological}} literature, medicalization is often theorized as a depoliticizing force. This {{perspective}} plays {{a central role}} in longstanding debates in gender studies over whether transgender subjectivities challenge or reinforce binary constructs of sex and gender. However, if medicalization is inherently depoliticizing, how do we explain the <b>shift—in</b> a matter of mere decades—from transsexualism as a nascent medical diagnosis to a highly articulated transgender identity and struggle for transgender rights in a host of social and cultural arenas? This dissertation explores this question by examining the evolution of and relationship between medicine and the transgender rights movement. Borrowing from institutional ethnography, I employ a triangulated methodological approach that includes: in-depth interviews with activists and health care providers; participant observation at transgender health conferences and community events; and discourse analysis of historical and contemporary materials on transgender medicine and health. Findings reveal that the material and discursive practices of medicine not only shape transgender people 2 ̆ 7 s experiences in health care settings but also influence how we define (trans) gendered subjectivity, thus shaping the contours of (trans) gender identity and rights in a variety of social institutions, and in culture at large. The multiple, and often contradictory, functions and effects of medicalization result in a tension between resistance to and reliance on medicine within the transgender rights movement. For instance, constructions of transgender identities as pathological are rejected {{at the same time as}} bio-medical models are accepted or advocated as a means to gain rights and recognition. Health care providers are also conflicted about medicalization, which leads them to variously adopt, resist, and reframe the official discourses and protocols of their professions in their day-to-day work. I use these findings to theorize medicalization as a site of struggle rather than a static variable, and forward an account of the transgender rights movement as an embodied health movement. While transgender subjects and subjectivities have typically not been considered outside of gender studies, this research demonstrates how attention to transgender medicine and movements can also contribute to the literature in both medical sociology and social movements. ...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 22 - 27). Spatial memory decline {{has been}} well documented in older humans and animals. The decline has been reported to stem from age-related changes in various brain regions including the hippocampus. Recent studies have revealed that the hippocampus is important for the detection of metric and topological changes in the allocentric relationship among stimuli. However, little is known about age-related differences in the ability to detect these changes. In the current study, 25 young (6 month) and 22 aged (24 month) Fischer- 344 /Brown- Norway rats were tested on a paradigm designed to assess object-place memory for metric and topological changes using an exploratory-based, novelty detection task. Performance on this task {{has been shown to be}} dependent on the hippocampus. Metric changes were made by altering the distance between two objects, while topological changes were made by changing the object configuration. The metric task involved four 5 -min sessions, with a 3 -min intersession interval between Sessions 1, 2, and 3, and a 10 -min intersession interval between Sessions 3 and 4. Prior to testing, two different objects were positioned 68 cm apart in an open field. Sessions 1 - 3 allowed for habituation to the two objects. During Session 4, the objects were shifted in to a 38 cm separation for the first metric test and shifted out to 98 cm separation for the second test. The topological task involved five 5 -min sessions, with a 3 -min intersession interval after Sessions 1 and 3, and a 10 -min intersession interval after Sessions 2 and 4. Prior to testing, four different objects were positioned 68 cm apart in a square formation in an open field. Sessions 1 and 2 allowed for habituation to the four objects. During Sessions 3 and 4, two of the objects were transposed. During Session 5, the remaining two objects were transposed. There was a 48 -hr separation between metric and topological tests. Object exploration was recorded during all sessions and analyzed for age differences. In order to assess age group differences in exploration during the metric task, two separate 2 x 4 repeated measures ANOVAs were run for each condition, <b>shift-in</b> and shift-out, with Group (6 month, 24 month) as a between group variable and Session (1 - 4) as a within group variable. In order to assess age group differences in exploration during the topological task, a 2 x 2 repeated measures ANOVA was conducted with Group (6 month, 24 month) as a between group variable and Location (Front Switch, Back Switch) as a within group variable. Young rats spent significantly more time exploring displaced objects during the metric task compared to aged rats when the objects were shifted in. During the topological task, young rats spent significantly more time exploring objects when the front two objects were transposed compared to aged rats. The results of this study suggest that age-related changes in the hippocampus impair memory for metric and topological spatial representations. Impairments in the detection of metric and topological spatial change may be useful indicators of age-related memory decline...|$|E
