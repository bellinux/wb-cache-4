5|$|Banksia verticillata {{is seldom}} seen in cultivation. The natural growing {{conditions}} {{point to a}} sunny aspect and good drainage as being important in cultivation. It is good for coastal <b>situations</b> <b>and</b> erosion control. Very sensitive to dieback, B. verticillata (like most other western Australian banksias) perishes quickly in humid conditions or poor drainage. It has been grafted successfully onto Banksia integrifolia. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 49 days to germinate.|$|E

5|$|It {{is perhaps}} no {{accident}} that the factuality of the Italian Renaissance has been most vigorously questioned by those who are not obliged to take a professional interest in the aesthetic aspects of civilization—historians of economic and social developments, political and religious <b>situations,</b> <b>and,</b> most particularly, natural science—but only exceptionally by students of literature and hardly ever by historians of Art.|$|E

5|$|Synthetic diamond {{transistors}} {{have been}} produced in the laboratory.

5|$|The {{chemicals}} in the red-colored zone include an aromatic quinone, beta-carotene, and chlorophyll. The quinone is deep-red colored pigment chiodectonic acid, thought {{to function as a}} radiation protectant; in combination with beta-carotene, which has an established role in cellular DNA repair following exposure of the organism to UV-damage, such radiation protectants are often found in lichens and in extremophilic <b>situations</b> <b>and</b> are essential for survival.|$|E

5|$|The {{primary role}} of the halfback, {{also known as the}} tailback, is to carry the ball on running plays. Halfbacks may also serve as receivers.

5|$|At {{least two}} episodes of {{earthquakes}} constitute the Nazko swarm. In the first seismic phase from October 9 to November 1, 2007, {{a total of}} 153 earthquakes took place. During the second seismic phase between September 25, 2007 and June 12, 2008, 4,428 earthquakes occurred. These two seismic episodes were cross-correlated by scientists to understand changes {{in the development of}} the earthquake swarm. Correlation coefficients were around 1.0 for the beginnings of the periods of activity, indicating almost identical <b>situations,</b> <b>and</b> then decayed to around 0.5, indicating a decrease in similarity between the later stages of the two events.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{religious}} references in the series, Nakamura stated she used only her personal knowledge and {{some aspects of}} modern society, such as yakuza and blogging, which were {{not intended to be}} critical but were added because they fit the story. Similarly, secondary characters were only introduced in the series if a chapter needed a new character to introduce a topic. The themes of the chapters were created before the <b>situations</b> <b>and</b> jokes. However, if Nakamura had a specific theme, she created several jokes and then connected them to form a story. When creating a simpler chapter as compared to the more elaborate, thematic ones, she wrote without worrying about creating jokes and situations in advance. With the help of her four assistants, on average she took between ten days and two weeks to make a complete chapter.|$|E
5|$|Early in his career, Sanchez {{was praised}} {{for his ability}} to {{maintain}} composure in the pocket amidst defensive pressure and focus on finding an open receiver to extend the team's offensive series. In his four-year career, Sanchez has had ten fourth quarter comebacks and twelve game winning drives. These characteristics were highlighted by Bill Parcells and Sam Wyche and garnered comparisons to Ben Roethlisberger. Sanchez was also noted for his proficiency in short passing <b>situations</b> <b>and</b> competitive nature; in December 2010, following dismal performances, Rex Ryan threatened to reduce Sanchez's repetitions with the first team offense during practice which infuriated Sanchez.|$|E
5|$|Ehrhoff {{is known}} as an {{offensive}} defenceman. He has strong skating ability, which allows him to quickly carry the puck up the ice, starting plays from his team's defensive zone, as well as join offensive plays deep in the opposing team's zone. He also possesses a hard shot, which earns him significant time on the power play. Upon joining the NHL with San Jose, he had to adjust his game to be more defensive. He gradually became counted upon more in defensive <b>situations</b> <b>and</b> has been used on the penalty kill, as well.|$|E

5|$|In {{the game}} of baseball, the {{official}} scorer is a person appointed by the league to record the events on the field, and to send the official scoring record of the game back to the league offices. In addition to recording the events on the field such as the outcome of each plate appearance and the circumstances of any baserunner's advance around the bases, the official scorer is also charged with making judgment calls that do not affect the progress or outcome of the game. Judgment calls are primarily made about errors, unearned runs, fielder's choice, the value of hits in certain <b>situations,</b> <b>and</b> wild pitches, {{all of which are}} included in the record compiled. This record is used to compile statistics for each player and team. A box score is a summary of the official scorer's game record.|$|E
