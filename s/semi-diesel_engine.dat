5000|$|The class used {{a mixture}} of {{propulsion}} methods. M21 and [...] M22 were fitted with conventional triple-expansion steam engines, M24 was fitted with four-cylinder paraffin engines, and the remainder received Bolinder four-cylinder <b>semi-diesel</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 26 October 1912 the Anglo Belgian {{corporation}} was founded; {{the company}} was to manufacture the new <b>semi-diesel</b> <b>engines.</b> One of the investors was the Onghena company, a manufacturer of gas engines, which would contribute part of their factory space and machinery towards {{the production of the}} new machines. Eight investors including Onghena each contributed 500,000 Belgian francs towards the enterprise; a ninth investor the company Carels Brothers contributed diesel engine manufacturing licenses in exchange for a 5% return of the company's turnover.|$|R

50|$|Dimadis-Kanakis (since 1986 Kanakis E.P.E.) is a {{historic}} Greek engine and metal products manufacturer, based in Volos. It was founded in 1920 by Pavlos Dimadis and Ioannis Kanakis, initially focusing on engine repair and rebuilding. In 1926 the company developed and produced its first <b>semi-diesel</b> <b>engines</b> (10-60 hp, mostly for boat power). Soon an extended range of engine models, up to 120 hp, was developed and the company {{became one of the}} best known Greek engine makers, mostly remembered for the reliability of its products. Some exports were also made.|$|R
50|$|In 1912, CP {{began to}} produce an {{horizontal}} 2-cycle <b>semi-Diesel</b> oil <b>engine</b> to power CP compressors. One year later, CP finalized the Simplate valve; it deleted valve gear, offered controllability with high speeds and brought more capacity.|$|R
5000|$|The lake had {{previously}} been enlarged in 1898 by the Yale Electricity Company, who built a dam and used the water to generate power at Dolwen, located near Tanygrisiau, below the lower reservoir. The company was formed by the Votty Quarry company, and direct current was transmitted by overhead line to Dolgarregddu, near the centre of Blaenau Ffestiniog, {{where there was a}} [...] gas <b>engine</b> and two <b>semi-diesel</b> <b>engines,</b> which generated an additional 240 kW. This was used to supply power to the town when it was not required by the quarry. Because of the voltage drop in the system, a final 48 kW booster set was needed at the quarry. The Dolwen station continued to operate after the new scheme was finished, although it was subsequently decommissioned and the building was converted into two semi-detached houses, and then an 8-bedroom detached house.|$|R
50|$|In 1925 {{the sons}} {{built the first}} {{authentic}} Italian tractor, a 30 hp machine. It was a success and was the forerunner of the viable range of Landini 40 and 50 hp models {{which appeared in the}} mid-1930s and were to become renowmed under the names of Velite, Bufalo, and Super. The first production tractors were powered by a 40 hp <b>semi-diesel</b> <b>engine</b> which was a two stroke single-cylinder unit. The company continued to produce semi-diesel engined tractors until 1957. When World War II started, the production stopped.|$|E
5000|$|Only a {{few weeks}} after the {{occupation}} began, the first boats of an [...] "armada" [...] of fishing vessels and other boats began to arrive in Shetland. Many of these boats made several journeys across the North Sea carrying refugees. The boats were of many types and shapes, but most of those later used as the [...] "Shetland Bus", were from 50 to 70 ft, with two masts and equipped with a 30 to [...] single-cylinder <b>semi-diesel</b> <b>engine,</b> which made the characteristic 'tonk-tonk' sound. They had a maximum speed of 9 kn.|$|E
5000|$|Many were [...] "Hardanger Cutters", with a {{straight}} bow and long stern from the Bergen area, others the more rounded [...] "Møre Cutters" [...] from the area around Ålesund. It appeared that the [...] "Møre Cutter" [...] was the strongest and best-fitted for the heavy weather in the North Sea. The boats were of many kinds and shapes but most of those used as a [...] "Shetland Bus", were from 50 - 70 ft in length, with two masts and equipped with a 30 to 70 hp single-cylinder <b>semi-diesel</b> <b>engine,</b> which made the characteristic [...] "tonk-tonk" [...] sound.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, {{business}} expanded in the Western United States, as did the company's catalog. It grew to include typewriters, hand trucks, railway velocipedes, pumps, tractors {{and a variety of}} warehouse and bulk shipping tools. The company became an industrial supplier distributing complete [...] "turn-key" [...] systems: tools, plumbing, gauges, gaskets, parts, valves and pipe. Its 1910 catalog contained over 800 pages. The Fairbanks Morse Company began producing oil and naptha engines in the 1890s with the purchase of the Charter line of engines (the first commercially available gas engine). Fairbanks Morse gas engine became a success with farmers. Irrigation, electricity generation, and oilfield work also benefited from these engines. Small lighting plants built by the company were also popular. Fairbanks Morse powerplants evolved by burning kerosene in 1893, coal gas in 1905, then to <b>semi-diesel</b> <b>engines</b> in 1913 and to full diesel engines in 1924. In 1914 the company began production of the Model Z single-cylinder engine in one-, three- and six-horsepower sizes. The Z was soon made in sizes up to [...] Over a half million units were produced in the following 30 years. The model Z found favor with farmers, and the Model N was popular in stationary industrial applications. The Company also had brief forays into building automobiles, tractors, corn shellers, hammermills, cranes, televisions, radios and refrigerators, but output was small in these fields.|$|R
5000|$|In 1922 Bellinghams owners {{determined}} that the vessel could be put to better uses. The vessel {{was taken to the}} Lake Union Drydock and Machine Works in Seattle where a [...] Fairbanks-Morse <b>semi-diesel</b> <b>engine</b> was installed. The upper works were also extensively reconfigured and the vessel was again equipped to run from Seattle to Ketchikan and other ports of the Inside Passage. In this service the vessel was operated under the name Norco by the Northland Transportation Company. In the late 1920s the vessel was briefly owned by a Ketchikan concern known as Citizens Light and Power Company, which {{was a part of the}} public utility empire assembled by businessman Wilbur B. Foshay (1881-1957).|$|E
5000|$|In 1906 an {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} on the steamer [...] "Vulcan": a gas suction engine was fitted, which reduced the size of crew needed to run the boat and also reduced the fuel consumption, but {{the size of the}} installation was still an issue. In 1911 a rival carrier had tried a <b>semi-diesel</b> <b>engine</b> which had proved to be successful. Fellows, Morton & Clayton Ltd built a boat for testing this engine (a Swedish Bolinder single-cylinder direct-reversing engine from J. & C.G. Bolinder of Stockholm) which was built with a similar hull to the steamers but with a shortened engine room. [...] "Linda" [...] became the first motor boat of the fleet. The new engine was a success and they immediately started building another nine. Due {{to the success of the}} new engine they converted all steamers to motor boats by 1927.|$|E
5000|$|Renwick Generating Plant, {{also known}} as the Municipal Steam Light Plant, is a {{historical}} industrial facility located in Renwick, Iowa, United States. G.L. Long was an engineer who was contracted in 1914 to design a steam-powered electrical light plant. It first distributed energy on March 14, 1915, at 6:00 p.m. [...] The steam engines were replaced by a 75-horsepower, two-cylinder, <b>semi-diesel</b> <b>engine</b> and generating equipment manufactured by Fairbanks-Morse in 1922. A 125-horsepower diesel engine manufactured by Worthington Pump and Machinery Corporation was added in 1936. At that time the plant started to supply power to a newly formed rural electric cooperative that was funded by the Rural Electrification Act of 1936. A Faribanks-Morse 300-horsepower, four-cylinder diesel was added in 1939, and the 75-horsepower and 40-horsepower engines were replaced in 1942 by another 300-horsepower diesel. An addition was added onto {{the north side of the}} building the same year. It housed the local fire department and city hall. The facility was listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.|$|E
