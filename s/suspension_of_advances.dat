40|$|The {{geometric}} control {{properties of}} vehicles with active suspensions are analyzed. A special attention {{is devoted to}} the problem of disturbance decoupling. Active <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>advanced</b> vehicles allow the active rejection of external disturbances exerted on the sprung mass of the vehicle and caused by road surface irregularity. We focus on the road irregularity disturbances with the purpose of isolating the chassis from vibrations transmitted through suspensions. The paper is aimed at the synthesis of a decoupling control law of the regulated outputs, i. e., roll, pitch and chassis height, from the external disturbances. The paper emphasizes that disturbance decoupling can be thought as a structural property of road vehicles with active suspensions. The framework throughout is the geometric approach to the control of dynamic systems. It is shown that a controlled and conditioned invariant subspace exists such that it allows the geometric disturbance localization. The decoupling problem with stability and the algebraic feedback <b>of</b> <b>suspension</b> heights, i. e. the system measurements, are considered.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a system of}} four novel shadow detectors having, collectively, a displacement sensitivity of (69 ± 13) picometres (rms) / √Hz, at 500 Hz, over a measuring span of ± 0. 1 mm. The detectors were designed to monitor the vibrations of the 600 mm long, 400 µm diameter, silica <b>suspension</b> fibres <b>of</b> the mirrors for the Advanced LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory) gravitational wave detectors, at the resonances of the so-called Violin Modes (VM). The VM detection system described here had a target sensitivity of 100 pm (rms) /√Hz at 500 Hz, together with, ultimately, a required detection span of ± 0. 1 mm about the mean position of each fibre—in order to compensate for potential slow drift over time of fibre position, due to mechanical relaxation. The full sensor system, comprising emitters (sources of illumination) and shadow detectors, therefore met these specifications. Using these sensors, VM resonances having amplitudes of 1. 2 nm (rms), were detected in the <b>suspension</b> fibres <b>of</b> an <b>Advanced</b> LIGO dummy test-mass. The VM bandwidth of the sensor, determined by its transimpedance amplifier, was 226 Hz– 8. 93 kHz at the — 3 dB points. This paper focuses mainly on the detector side of the shadow-sensors.
