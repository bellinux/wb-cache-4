5000|$|Part of {{a system}} {{is the use of}} “successive layers of {{protective}} envelopes and enclosures.” [...] Types of “layers” include nearly everything from storage <b>spaces,</b> <b>padded</b> shelves, non-acidic archival boxes and individual packaging. Each new layer should provide further protection by creating a microclimate buffer between an object and environmental fluctuations, light, dust and pollutants.|$|R

50|$|Ball grid arrays (BGA) {{and chip}} scale {{packages}} (CSA) present special difficulties for testing and rework, {{as they have}} many small, closely <b>spaced</b> <b>pads</b> on their underside which are connected to matching pads on the PCB. Connecting pins are not accessible from the top for testing, and cannot be desoldered without heating the whole device to the melting point of solder.|$|R
50|$|It {{is thought}} that the irons cannot be used indiscriminately for all work; the voltage across and current through the tip can damage {{electronic}} circuits being soldered. When not in contact with a joint, the split tip has 6 or more volts across it, enough to destroy semiconductor p-n junctions on contact if the iron accidentally touches multiple closely <b>spaced</b> <b>pads.</b> This is not static-electricity damage; any voltage over about 0.7V capable of delivering high current can destroy a semiconductor junction.|$|R

50|$|The {{required}} accuracy in alignment {{can also be}} achieved by controlling the flow of solder on the PWB during reflow soldering. For this purpose, the <b>space</b> between the <b>pads</b> is often coated with a solder mask. The solder mask materials have no affinity to the molten solder and hence, no positive bonding is formed between them as the solder solidifies. This process {{is often referred to}} as Solder Masking. The mask must be centered correctly. The mask protects the PWB against oxidation, and prevents unintended solder bridges from forming between closely <b>spaced</b> solder <b>pads.</b>|$|R

50|$|The PAD model, and the {{corresponding}} <b>PAD</b> <b>Space</b> {{have been used in}} the construction of animated agents that exhibit emotions.For instance, Becker et al. describe how primary and secondary emotions can be mapped via the <b>PAD</b> <b>space</b> to features in the faces of animated characters to reflect happiness, boredom, frustration or annoyance.

30|$|As to on-chip applications, a high {{surface density}} of TFTCs {{certainly}} increases the spatial resolution and accuracy in temperature measurement, {{but it also}} remarkably increases the number of pads and connections for the TFTC array, leading to complex interconnection. Therefore, the density of sensors in the array should be balanced between being enough to give required sensing resolution and being minimum to reduce the complexity of interconnection and <b>space</b> of <b>pads.</b>|$|R
50|$|In some cases, an affective <b>space,</b> the <b>PAD</b> {{emotional}} state model, {{can be used}} to assign specific emotions to the faces of avatars.

A mid-level Partial Expression Parameters (PEP) space is then used to in a two-level structure - the PAD-PEP mapping and the PEP-FAP translation model.|$|R
