5|$|Leroux {{was one of}} 21 {{professional}} athletes featured in ESPN's The Body Issue in 2013. She appeared semi-nude on one of eight covers for the magazine. Of the experience <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> {{think a lot of}} females struggle with the way they look, and I wanted to show that everyone's body is different. I think it's a big deal to be an athlete and feel confident in your body and show it off. I'm not going to say I've never struggled with how I look, but I've reached a point in my life where I'm happy with who I am.|$|E
5|$|The production’s incredible. The beat {{is just so}} {{constant}} and powerful. That was the first song that I wrote with Dimitri and Maya. I felt like I’d found my sound. And I was kind {{of looking at it}} like an outfit. So it was, ‘if this was an outfit, what would this song need now?’ So we had the pretty dress, which was the chorus. We had the lovely shoes, which was the verse. ‘But what do we need to really set this song off? A big, fancy, bow in the hair would really set this song off.’ So when I got to the middle eight I wanted to go really erratic, almost like taTu on All The Things <b>She</b> <b>Said.</b> <b>I</b> wanted it to be proper fucked up and crazy – hands in the air.|$|E
25|$|Peru is {{investigating}} claims that a beauty pageant contestant was lured to Gabon {{to become the}} lover of its 67-year-old president, Omar Bongo, and was stranded for nearly two weeks after she refused. A spokesman for Mr. Bongo said {{he was unaware of}} the allegations. The Peruvian Foreign Ministry said that Ivette Santa Maria, a 22-year-old Miss Peru America contestant, was invited to Gabon to be a hostess for a pageant there. In an interview, Ms. Santa Maria said that she was taken to Mr. Bongo's presidential palace hours after her Jan. 19 arrival and that as he joined her, he pressed a button and some sliding doors opened, revealing a large bed. <b>She</b> <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> told him I was not a prostitute, that I was a Miss Peru. She fled and guards offered to drive her to a hotel. Without money to pay the bill, however, she was stranded in Gabon for 12 days until international women's groups and others intervened.|$|E
60|$|Nun. Strange, <b>she</b> <b>said</b> nought; <b>I</b> {{had hoped}} {{she had grown}} more pure.|$|R
60|$|So <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> and <b>I</b> wondered, feeling trammelled and hurt. It did {{not make}} me free.|$|R
60|$|Here {{has just}} been a fine alert; I gave my wife a dose of chlorodyne. 'Something wrong,' says <b>she.</b> 'Nonsense,' <b>said</b> <b>I.</b> 'Embrocation,' <b>said</b> <b>she.</b> <b>I</b> smelt it, and - it smelt very funny. 'I think it's just gone bad, and to-morrow will tell.' Proved to be so.|$|R
25|$|By {{the end of}} September 1957, {{the nine}} were {{admitted}} to Little Rock Central High {{under the protection of}} the 101st Airborne Division (and later the Arkansas National Guard), but they were still subjected to a year of physical and verbal abuse (being spat on and called names) by many of the white students. Melba Pattillo had acid thrown into her eyes and also recalled in her book, Warriors Don't Cry, an incident in which a group of white girls trapped her in a stall in the girls' washroom and attempted to burn her by dropping pieces of flaming paper on her from above. Another one of the students, Minnijean Brown, was verbally confronted and abused. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> was one of the kids 'approved' by the school officials. We were told we would have to take a lot and were warned not to fight back if anything happened. One girl ran up to me and said, 'I'm so glad you're here. Won't you go to lunch with me today?' I never saw her again.|$|E
500|$|During this {{intercourse}} I {{perceived the}} superiority of Miss Honora Sneyd's capacity ... her sentiments were on all subjects so just and were delivered with such blushing modesty though not without an air of conscious worth as to command attention from every one capable of appreciating female excellence. Her person was graceful her features beautiful and their expression such as to heighten the eloquence of every thing <b>she</b> <b>said.</b> <b>I</b> was six and twenty and {{now for the first}} time in my life I saw a woman that equalled the picture of perfection which existed in my imagination.|$|E
2500|$|In Hosea 2, {{the woman}} in the {{marriage}} metaphor could be Hosea’s wife [...] Gomer, or could be referring to the nation of Israel, invoking the metaphor of Israel as God's bride. The woman is not portrayed in a positive light. This is reflected throughout the beginning of Hosea 2. “I will strip her naked and expose her as in the day she was born” (Hosea 2:3). “Upon her children I will have no pity, because they are children of whoredom” (Hosea 2:4). “For <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> will go after my lovers...” (Hosea 2:5).|$|E
5000|$|... "My heart sank," [...] MacKenzie told me. [...] "In {{that moment}} when <b>she</b> <b>said</b> that, <b>I</b> felt betrayed and deeply worried." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Aren't there really?' <b>she</b> <b>said.</b> 'Oh, <b>I</b> thought savages {{were all}} so dangerous, they'd have your life before you could look round.' ...|$|R

2500|$|Connolly and {{his older}} sister, Florence (named for their {{maternal}} grandmother, and eighteen months his senior), were cared for by two aunts, Margaret and Mona Connolly, his father's sisters, in their cramped tenement in Stewartville Street, Partick. [...] "My aunts constantly told me I was stupid, which still affects me today pretty badly. It’s just a belief that I’m not quite as good as anyone else. It gets worse as you get older. I’m a happy man now but I still have the scars of that." [...] Regarding his sister, Connolly has called her his [...] "great defender". [...] "To this day, he explained in 2009, [...] "Guys say, 'God, your sister... We didn't dare beat you up – your sister was a nightmare'. She used to get after them." [...] In the mid-1960s, Flo was on holiday in Dunoon {{with her husband and}} two children. [...] "My mother said, 'I saw Florence walking along, and I followed her.'" [...] "I said, 'Did you speak to her?' 'Oh, no, I didn't,' <b>she</b> <b>said.</b> <b>I</b> thought, 'Oh, my god. It's like being a ghost while you're still alive.' Walking behind your own child. Having a look. I couldn't bear that." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{his return}} to America in 1841, Pratt found the church {{membership}} in contention over several issues. Rumors and gossip were rife in Nauvoo, Illinois, and Pratt found the religious principle of plural marriage difficult to accept. He rebelled against Joseph Smith when a report by disaffected Mormon John C. Bennett accused Smith of proposing marriage to Pratt's wife, Sarah Pratt, which Smith categorically denied. Additionally, a story was circulating that Sarah Pratt had been involved with Bennett himself. Pratt was torn between believing his wife or Smith, and wrote, [...] "My sorrows are greater than I can bear!" [...] A public meeting was held where a resolution supporting Smith's character was proposed; Pratt stated that {{he was unable to}} support the resolution, to which Smith replied, [...] "Have you personally a knowledge of any immoral act in me toward the female sex, or in any other way?", to which Pratt answered no. After days of Smith and {{the other members of the}} Twelve remonstrating with Pratt, they decided that he would not yield, and thus Pratt was excommunicated on August 20, 1842. Bennett claimed that Pratt and his wife were planning to leave Nauvoo and help him [...] "expose Mormonism"; Pratt would later publish a statement in the Nauvoo Expositor to deny this claim. Pratt reconciled with Smith a few months after their falling out and requested re-baptism. Pratt was reinstated in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on January 20, 1843. Smith and Pratt directly discussed Pratt's wife, with Smith stating to him, [...] "She lied about me: I never made the offer which <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> did." ...|$|E
60|$|So I {{told the}} landlady. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> must be back by twelve o'clock.|$|E
6000|$|... “We {{must call}} him {{something}} till {{we know who}} he really is,” <b>she</b> <b>said.</b> “Gabriel-Ernest, <b>I</b> think; those are nice suitable names.” ...|$|R
60|$|Ethelbertha glanced {{across at}} me with a {{somewhat}} curious expression, I thought; but as <b>she</b> <b>said</b> nothing, <b>I</b> continued the argument myself.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Certainly, I have a temperature,' <b>she</b> <b>said.</b> 'Certainly, <b>I</b> have a grave temperature. I {{should have}} been warned by that chill after dinner.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right. I've--married you. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> {{ought to}} marry you again, and I have straightway. It is true religion! Ha--ha--ha!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That man--master, <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> {{must call}} him. He kicked poor little Fan with his great heavy big boots--'cause Fan would say Wyn's prayers.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; {{she spoke}} quite spontaneously. The flowers, the garden, {{the beauty of}} the country, so strangely {{different}} to her former surroundings--that suggested what <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> think." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{the moment}} <b>she</b> <b>said</b> it <b>I</b> knew {{something}} was going to happen. You know that pre-what-d'you-call-it you get sometimes? Well, I got it then.|$|R
6000|$|... "'It's wrang o' me, Jamie,' <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> 'but <b>I</b> canna bear {{to think}} o' ye carryin' that aboot sae carefu'. No, I canna help it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I tell you, I wouldn't pay no {{attention}} to what <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> and <b>I</b> wouldn't make such a fuss over an old cow-bell, anyway." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She did that, {{and very}} movingly," [...] said Miss Grant. [...] "I {{would not like}} to tell you what <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> find you vain enough already." ...|$|E
60|$|All {{this while}} {{she went on}} talking, but of what <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> have not the faintest idea, because my {{remaining}} wits were absorbed in these much-needed implorations.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's worse, {{she leads}} him into mischief. We are fox, goose, and cabbage. Please {{give me my}} crutch; Wilmet {{put it out of}} reach because <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> was {{destroying}} myself.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, Mr Pinch!' <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> 'although <b>I</b> {{never used}} you well, I did believe your nature was forgiving. I {{did not think}} you could be cruel.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> and <b>I</b> halted fearfully. [...] "David Ritchie, {{you are a}} good man. I {{can make}} no amends to you,"--she did not finish.|$|R
6000|$|She {{found me}} roots of relish sweet [...] And honey wild and manna dew [...] And sure in {{language}} strange <b>she</b> <b>said</b> [...] <b>I</b> love thee true-- ...|$|R
6000|$|I rose, and looked; {{and turn}} she did; [...] I cried, [...] "My heart revives!" [...] "Look more," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said.</b> <b>I</b> looked as bid; [...] Her face {{was all the}} five's.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Aunt Maria said so. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> did not feel. Oh, if I {{could only}} die before he grows up to let one see it. Why wont {{you begin to}} hate me?' ...|$|E
60|$|And yet I {{must admit}} {{that there was a}} modicum of truth in what <b>she</b> <b>said.</b> <b>I</b> had been feeling pretty austere about the man all day, and I'll tell you why.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It was my husband,' <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> which <b>I</b> knew {{perfectly}} well. 'He said {{he would}} not have you in his house. You've had another quarrel with him!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Trot, my dear,' <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> when <b>I</b> {{opened my}} eyes, 'I couldn't {{make up my}} mind to disturb you. Mr. Peggotty is here; shall he come up?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{have been}} looking for you,” <b>she</b> <b>said.</b> “As <b>I</b> suppose {{everybody}} will be busy to-morrow morning, I may not see you then. But you seem downcast!” ...|$|R
