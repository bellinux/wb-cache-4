Most home lifts come with an open platform structure to free even more space and grant access from 3 different sides of the platform. This requires all producers to include specific safety mechanisms and, in some countries, to limit the travel speed.|$|R

50|$|Cottonseed meal is a {{good source}} of protein. The two types of meal {{extraction}} processes are solvent extraction and mechanical extraction. Most of the meal is extracted mechanically through cottonseed kernels. The flaked cottonseed kernels are put into high pressure through a screw inside a barrel which is constantly revolving. The <b>screw</b> <b>pushes</b> out the oil through the openings made in the barrel. The dry pieces left in the barrel are preserved and ground into meal. During the solvent extraction process, the cottonseed kernels are subjected to fine grinding by pushing them through an expander and then the solvent is used to extract most of the oil. The solvent-extracted meals have a lower fat content of 0.5% than the mechanically extracted meals with a fat content of 2.0%. Cottonseed meal is considered to have more arginine than soybean meal. Cottonseed meal can be used in multiple ways: either alone or by mixing it with other plant and animal protein sources.|$|R

5000|$|Set screws are {{not always}} {{the best way to}} resist the torque of driven shafts. To reduce the chance of {{slipping}} and to increase load capacity, a detent (often called a [...] "flat") may be milled or ground at the part of the shaft where the set screw's point contacts. The detent, however, must be closely aligned with the threaded hole prior to fastening. The operator can often feel the <b>screw</b> <b>push</b> the flat into final alignment as he or she makes the last half- or quarter-turn that tightens the screw. Set screws can successfully hold against heavy-torque applications if the details are right. For example, endmill holders of the solid type typically use large set screws holding against flats to fasten the endmill, and heavy loads are resisted. However, small set screws without flats are prone to spinning and galling if overloaded. The use of keys and keyways instead of, or in combination with, set screws is common for applications requiring high torque resistance or transmission. Splines offer yet more strength.|$|R

30|$|The {{manufacture}} of HDPE pipes of 32  mm outer diameter involves an extrusion process for extruding a hollow pipe using blow molding technique. The elements required for extrusion process are the extruding machine setup and PolyEthylene (PE) granules. The selected {{material for the}} pipe (PE granules) is first heated in the mixer machine. After attaining the required temperature, it is manually fed into the extruder machine through a feeder. Here, the material enters into the long barrel of the machine where the material is fed all through the process through the feeding zone, melts in the melting zone and is pushed into the die head in the pushing zone. Here, the barrel {{is divided into three}} zones to maintain equal material flow rate throughout the process. For this purpose, a rotating screw is fixed inside the barrel (which would be almost the size of the barrel). This <b>screw</b> <b>pushes</b> the material from the feeder to the die head. The die head is fixed, based on the diameter of the pipe required. At this die head, pressurized air is sent in between the material for attaining hollow shape. The pipe coming out of the die head is cooled using cooling water supply for the solidification purpose. Proper cooling temperature should be maintained for the solidification and smooth finish of the pipe at the die head. The pipe coming out of die head is first sent into the cooling tank and then it is pulled by the take-off machine. The speed of the take-off machine is set based on the required pipe thickness. This pipe will be further sent for pressure testing to test the withstanding pressure. HDPE plastic pipes are mainly used for transportation of water {{from one place to another}} place. Hence, these pipes undergo tremendous pressure by water. Higher withstanding pressure is supposed to result in a better condition of the pipe. Therefore, the withstanding pressure should be set the higher the better.|$|R

40|$|Biorefinery of {{sunflower}} whole {{plant can}} be conducted with water using a nine modules Clextral Evolum HT 53 twin-screw extruder (TSE). Aqueous extraction of oil is an environmentally cleaner alternative technology to solvent extraction. TSE carries out three unit operations: conditioning and grinding, liquid/solid (L/S) extraction and L/S separation. The compressing {{action by the}} reverse screws (CF 2 C) is essential for L/S separation. Positioned in module 9, CF 2 C <b>screws</b> <b>push</b> part of the mixture upstream against the general movement in TSE, and this counter pressure ensures the L/S separation efficiency above the metal filter, located in eighth position. Oil is extracted {{in the form of}} two emulsions, stabilized by phospholipids and proteins, and usable as co-emulsifiers in cosmetic industry. An aqueous extract containing water-soluble components from whole plant is also generated; it could be recycled. As a mixture of fibers and proteins, the cake can be moulded by thermo-pressing into boards, usable in the furniture and building industries. In this study, fractionation was conducted from next inlet flow rates: 54 kg/h solid and 183 kg/h water (3. 4 L/S ratio). The screw speed varied from 249 to 124 rpm, corresponding to a filling coefficient (ratio of the solid inlet flow rate to the screw speed) from 217 to 436 g/h rpm. The filling coefficient directly affects the L/S separation efficiency. The latter can be estimated from next experimental data: the outlet flow rates of both cake and filtrate, the cake moisture content, the residual contents of oil and water-soluble components in the cake, and the extraction yields in dry matter, lipids and water-soluble components. For low filling coefficients (i. e. high screw speed), the L/S mixture compression in CF 2 C screws is insufficient, not allowing a satisfactory L/S separation. Conversely, for high filling coefficients (i. e. low screw speed), solid particles accumulate more upstream from the pressing zone, obstructing part of the filtering screens and thus reducing the filtration surface. A less efficient L/S separation is then observed. From the experimental data evolution, optimal screw speed was estimated at 182 rpm using a second order polynomial regression, corresponding to a filling coefficient of 297 g/h rpm. Extraction yields in dry matter, lipids and water-soluble components were 22 %, 49 % and 40 %, respectively. Such filling would lead to a specific mechanical energy of 103 W/h kg whole plant processed...|$|R

40|$|In {{aircraft}} wing design, engineers aim {{to provide the}} best possible aerodynamic performance under cruise flight conditions in terms of lift-to-drag ratio. Conventional control surfaces such as flaps, ailerons, variable wing sweep and spoilers are used to trim the aircraft for other flight conditions. The appearance of the morphing wing concept launched a new challenge in the area of overall wing and aircraft performance improvement during different flight segments by locally altering the flow over the aircraft 2 ̆ 019 s wings. This paper describes the development and application of a control system for an actuation mechanism integrated in a new morphing wing structure. The controlled actuation system includes four similar miniature electromechanical actuators disposed in two parallel actuation lines. The experimental model of the morphing wing is based on a full-scale portion of an {{aircraft wing}}, which is equipped with an aileron. The upper surface of the wing is a flexible one, being closed to the wing tip; the flexible skin is made of light composite materials. The four actuators are controlled in unison to change the flexible upper surface to improve the flow quality on the upper surface by delaying or advancing the transition point from laminar to turbulent regime. The actuators transform the torque into vertical forces. Their bases are fixed on the wing ribs and their top link arms are attached to supporting plates fixed onto the flexible skin with <b>screws.</b> The actuators <b>push</b> or pull the flexible skin using the necessary torque until the desired vertical displacement of each actuator is achieved. The four vertical displacements of the actuators, correlated with the new shape of the wing, are provided by a database obtained through a preliminary aerodynamic optimization for specific flight conditions. The control system is designed to control the positions of the actuators in real time in order to obtain and to maintain the desired shape of the wing for a specified flight condition. The feasibility and effectiveness of the developed control system by use of a proportional fuzzy feed-forward methodology are demonstrated experimentally through bench and wind tunnel tests of the morphing wing model.
