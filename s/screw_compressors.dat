25|$|Any type of pump {{that can}} deliver the {{required}} pressure difference and flow volume can be used. Most often used is the dynamic-compression centrifugal type compressor, which {{is familiar to}} most as being used in vacuum cleaners and turbochargers, but multistaged axial-flow compressor types, {{similar to those used}} in most jet engines, could work as well, although there would be little need for the added cost and complexities involved, as they typically don't require such a high flow rate as a jet engine, nor are they limited by the aerodynamic drag considerations which makes a narrow-diameter axial compressor more effective in jet engines than a centrifugal compressor of equal air flow. Positive displacement types such as piston compressors, or rotary types such as a Roots blower could also be used with suitable provisions for damping the pulsations in the air flow (however, other rotary types such as twin <b>screw</b> <b>compressors</b> are capable of providing a steady supply of compressed fluid). The pressure ratio of a single fan blade is too low and cannot be used.|$|E

Cross section of outer shell of ballast tank {{is described as}} cylinder, one dimensional flow equations combined with <b>screw</b> <b>compressor</b> performance model are employed to describe compressor’s flow characteristic. Coupled effect between gas pressure in ballast tank and discharging performance of <b>screw</b> <b>compressor</b> is considered in the presenting model as gas leakage during compressing process is taken into account. Deballasting duration for one certain submarine model is calculated using the developed model, and the result agrees well with that obtained by using Chinese state code for submarine low pressure system design. For different cross section tank models as circular section model, parabolic section model and trapezoidal section model, dynamic performance of <b>screw</b> <b>compressor</b> deballasting system is studied using the validated model.

40|$|The <b>screw</b> <b>compressor</b> in {{the early}} stage of {{development}} is generally known as the oil-injection type. However, escalating environmental problems and advances in electronic components have spurred continuous R & D to minimize the oil content in compressed air. The oil-free twin-screw compressor is continuously compressed by inner volumetric change between rotors and casing. For this reason, in order to predict the overall performance of the <b>screw</b> <b>compressor</b> at the early stage of the design process, industry still relies on the empirical method. However, it is difficult using the existing empirical method to gain more information of the inner fluid flow of the twin-screw compressor. Flow simulation techniques using CFD are required.
