40|$|Changes in {{the mean}} sea ice {{thickness}} and concentration in the Arctic are well known. However, quantitative information about changes in the ice thickness distribution and {{the composition of the}} pack ice is lacking. In this paper we determine the ice draft distributions, mean and modal thicknesses, and their regional and seasonal variability in the Arctic for the time period 1975 – 2000. We compare characteristics of the Arctic pack ice for the years 1975 – 1987 and 1988 – 2000. These periods represent different large-scale atmospheric circulation modes and sea ice circulation patterns, most evident in clearly weaker Beaufort Gyre and stronger as well as westward shifted Transpolar Drift during the later period. The comparison of these two periods reveals that the peak of sea ice draft distributions has narrowed and shifted toward thinner ice, with reductions in both mean and modal ice draft. These noticeable changes are attributed to the loss of thick, mostly deformed ice. <b>Springtime,</b> <b>loss</b> of ice volume with draft greater than 5 m exceeds 35 % in all regions except the Nansen Basin, with as much as 45 % or more at the North Pole and in the Eastern Arctic. Autumn volume reduction, mostly of deformed ice, exceeds 40 % in the Canada Basin only, but is above 30 % also in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. During the later period, the volume of ice category consisting thin, mostly level first-year ice, is clearly larger than during the former period, especially in the spring. In the Beaufort Sea region, changes in the composition of ice cover have resulted in a shift of modal draft from level multiyear ice draft range to values of level first-year ice. The regional and seasonal variability of sea ice draft has decreased, since the thinning has been most pronounced in regions with the thickest pack ice (the Western Arctic), and during the spring (0. 6 – 0. 8 m per decade) ...|$|E
40|$|Long-term ozone {{variations}} at 60 - 70 degS {{in spring}} are investigated using ground-based and satellite measurements. Strong positive correlation is shown between year-to-year variations of ozone and {{temperature in the}} Antarctic collar region in Septembers and Octobers. Based on this relationship, the effect of year-to-year variations in vortex dynamics has been filtered out. This process results in an ozone time series that shows increasing <b>springtime</b> ozone <b>losses</b> over the Antarctic until the mid- 1990 s. Since approximately 1997 the ozone losses have leveled off. The analysis confirms that this change is consistent across all instruments and is statistically significant at the 95 % confidence level. This analysis quantifies {{the beginning of the}} recovery of the ozone hole, which is expected from the leveling off of stratospheric halogen loading due to the ban on CFCs and other halocarbons initiated by the Montreal Protocol...|$|R
40|$|Optical depth records {{indicate}} that volcanic aerosols from major eruptions often produce clouds that have greater surface area than typical Arctic polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs). A trajectory cloud–chemistry model {{is used to}} study how volcanic aerosols could affect <b>springtime</b> Arctic ozone <b>loss</b> processes, such as chlorine activation and denitrification, in a cold winter within the current range of natural variability. Several studies indicate that severe denitrification can increase Arctic ozone loss by up to 30 %. We show large PSC particles that cause denitrification in a nonvolcanic stratosphere cannot efficiently form in a volcanic environment. However, volcanic aerosols, when present at low altitudes, where Arctic PSCs cannot form, can extend the vertical range of chemical ozone loss in the lower stratosphere. Chemical processing on volcanic aerosols over a 10 -km altitude range could increase the current levels of <b>springtime</b> column ozone <b>loss</b> by up to 70 % independent of denitrification. Climate models predict that the lower stratosphere is cooling {{as a result of}} greenhouse gas built-up in the troposphere. The magnitude of column ozone loss calculated here for the 1999 – 2000 Arctic winter, in an assumed volcanic state, is similar to that projected for a colder future nonvolcanic stratosphere in the 2010 decade...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamical}} {{barrier to}} meridional mixing {{at the edge}} of the Antarctic spring stratospheric vortex is examined. Diagnostics are presented which demonstrate the link between the shape of the meridional mixing barrier {{at the edge of}} the vortex and the meridional gradients in total column ozone across the vortex edge. Results derived from reanalysis and measurement data sets are compared with equivalent diagnostics from five coupled chemistry-climate models to test how well the models capture the interaction between the dynamical structure of the stratospheric vortex and the chemical processes occurring within the vortex. Results show that the accuracy of the simulation of the dynamical vortex edge varies widely amongst the models studied here. This affects the ability of the models to simulate the large observed meridional gradients in total column ozone. Three of the models in this study simulated the inner edge of the vortex to be more than 7 &deg; closer to the pole than observed. This is expected to have important implications for how well these models simulate the extent of severe <b>springtime</b> ozone <b>loss</b> that occurs within the Antarctic vortex...|$|R

40|$|Results form {{modeling}} {{studies of}} the Antarctic lower stratosphere which have attempted to simulate the large <b>springtime</b> ozone <b>losses</b> and corresponding changes in other trace constituents are given. These {{studies were carried out}} in a photochemical box model, a one-dimensional model without transport and in a two-dimensional photochemical-dynamical-radiation model. The photochemical studies have investigated inter alia the sensitivity of ozone to inclusion in the model of heterogeneous chemistry, and to the inclusion of the ClO dimer. When both of these are incorporated in the model, ozone depletions resembling whose found in Halley Bay in 1987 (J. C. Farman, Nature, 329, 1987) can be reproduced. The temporal variations (both diurnal and during the August to October period) of a number of important tracers including HCl, ClONO 2, OClO and BrO are discussed. The two-dimensional study concentrated on the difficulty of establishing in the model the dynamical preconditioning of the lower polar stratosphere - low temperatures, low N 2 O, etc., high ClOx. Calculations are presented to show: (1) the depletion of ozone during the springtime season, (2) the effect of large ozone losses on lower latitudes, and (3) the longer term (multi-year) variations of ozone in Antarctica, assuming realistic increases in the atmospheric halogen burden...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{extent of}} <b>springtime</b> Arctic ozone <b>loss</b> does not reach Antarctic “ozone hole ” {{dimensions}} {{because of the}} generally higher temperatures in the northern hemisphere vortex and consequent less polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) particle surface for heterogeneous chlorine activation.

To infer if present Antarctic PSC occurrence {{can be applied to}} predict future Arctic PSC occurrence, lidar observations from McMurdo station (78 ◦ S, 167 ◦ E) and Ny ˚Alesund (79 ◦ N, 12 ◦ E) have been analysed for the 9 winters between 1995 (1995 / 1996) and 2003 (2003 / 2004).

40|$|The gas-phase {{reaction}} between BrO and CIO {{has been}} proposed as a potentially fast and synergistic mechanism of stratospheric ozone destruction. Further, it has been advanced 1 as a contributing factor to Antarctic <b>springtime</b> ozone column <b>losses</b> of ∼ 40 % from 1960 to 1985 2, 3 Both dynamical 4 and chemical theories 1, 5 - 8 have been advanced to explain {{the formation of the}} Antarctic 'ozone hole'. A major uncertainty in these theories has been the rate constant and product distribution of the BrO + ClO reaction as a function of temperature. Here we report the first direct measurements of these parameters. We show that this reaction could, indeed, account for a large fraction of the springtime ozone depletion over Antarctica and provide a source of chlorine dioxide of sufficient magnitude to explain the recent measurements of this species in the Antarctic stratosphere, provided that the stratosphere contains a sufficient quantity of bromine (∼ 20 p. p. t. v.). © 1987 Nature Publishing Group...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThree-dimensional {{chemical}} transport models (CTMs) and coupled chemistry-climate models (CCMs) {{have been widely}} used to study the dynamical and chemical processes which control polar ozone depletion. Despite generally good agreement between modelled and observed loss, there are still some uncertainties in our understanding and limitations of the models. For example, the accuracy of modelled <b>springtime</b> ozone <b>loss</b> depends critically on the transport, chemistry and treatment of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs). There is also increasing evidence that descent of NOx from the mesosphere can impact ozone at high latitudes, {{even in the absence of}} halogen-catalysed loss. CCMs used for future predictions need to accurately include these processes. At the time of writing (late February 2016) the current Arctic winter has been cold with extensive PSC ac- tivity. The local maximum modelled O 3 loss is currently ∼ 50 % (www. see. leeds. ac. uk/tomcat), which is similar to that from previous cold years with record ozone depletion (e. g. 2010 / 11). This is interesting in its own right, but will also provide new meteorological conditions under which to test modelled loss against observations. We will present results from the TOMCAT/SLIMCAT off-line 3 -D CTM and the NCAR Whole Atmo- sphere Community Climate Model (WACCM), which we have recently extended by including mesospheric ion chemistry. Both models are forced or nudged by the ECMWF ERA-Interim 4 D-var reanalyses. First we will focus on the cold Arctic winter/spring 2015 / 16 and quantify the amount of chemical ozone loss using both models and satellite observations. Then we will investigate the chorine activation and denitrification as well as mesospheric NOx/HOx impact on stratospheric ozone. Other sensitivities experiments will be also discussed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSystematic {{ground-based}} {{measurements of}} the ozone and aerosol stratospheric profile performed in the Dumont d'Urville (66. 4 °S, 140 °E) Antarctic station are used to study the air subsidence in fall, the <b>springtime</b> ozone <b>loss,</b> and the vortex confinement on an interannual basis. The data obtained mostly from March to October in the 1992 – 1998 time period are analyzed {{as a function of}} equivalent latitude in order to discriminate the measurements performed inside, at the edge or outside the vortex. The subsidence rate derived from the ozone measurements in the lower stratosphere prior to the destruction period and from the volcanic aerosol measurements in 1992 is in good agreement with the estimation provided by radiative transfer models. The analysis of the ozone seasonal variation shows that the ozone destruction starts in the beginning of August and affects essentially the inner vortex or inner edge regions. The destruction lasts up to the end of September and low ozone values are found up to the end of October, confirming the isolation of the polar vortex above 400 K. Ozone destruction rates of the order of 3 %/d in the 400 – 475 K region and 1. 5 %/d around 550 K are derived from the data obtained inside the vortex. The ozone measurements obtained in October allow to study the vortex confinement which shows the increase of the ozone meridional gradient through the vortex edge from 400 to 650 K. A fine view of the vortex edge is provided by a near daily series of aerosol lidar measurements performed in October 1992, a period when the vortex was deformed by planetary waves and slanted with respect to the vertical direction...|$|R
40|$|We {{have used}} the GSFC coupled {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) model to study the impact of increasing carbon dioxide from 1980 to 2050 on the recovery of ozone to its pre- 1980 amounts. We find that the changes in temperature and circulation arising from increasing CO 2 affect ozone recovery in a manner which varies greatly with latitude, altitude, and time of year. Middle and upper stratospheric ozone recovers faster at all latitudes due to a slowing of the ozone catalytic loss cycles. In the lower stratosphere, the recovery of tropical ozone is delayed due to a decrease in production and a speed up in the overturning circulation. The recovery of high northern latitude lower stratospheric ozone is delayed in spring and summer due {{to an increase in}} <b>springtime</b> heterogeneous chemical <b>loss,</b> and is speeded up in fall and winter due to increased downwelling. The net effect on the higher northern latitude column ozone is to slow down the recovery from late March to late July, while making it faster at other times. In the high southern latitudes, the impact of CO 2 cooling is negligible. Annual mean column ozone is predicted to recover faster at all latitudes, and globally averaged ozone is predicted to recover approximately ten years faster as a result of increasing CO 2...|$|R
40|$|Boreal spring {{climate is}} uniquely {{susceptible}} to solar warming mechanisms {{because it has}} expansive snow cover and receives relatively strong insolation. Carbonaceous particles can influence snow coverage by warming the atmosphere, reducing surface-incident solar energy (dimming), and reducing snow reflectance after deposition (darkening). We apply a range of models and observations to explore impacts of these processes on springtime climate, drawing several conclusions: 1) Nearly all atmospheric particles (those with visible-band single-scatter albedo less than 0. 999), including all mixtures of black carbon (BC) and organic matter (OM), increase net solar heating of the atmosphere-snow column. 2) Darkening caused by small concentrations of particles within snow exceeds the loss of absorbed energy from concurrent dimming, thus increasing solar heating of snowpack as well (positive net surface forcing). Over global snow, we estimate 6 -fold greater surface forcing from darkening than dimming, caused by BC+OM. 3) Equilibrium climate experiments suggest that fossil fuel and biofuel emissions of BC+OM induce 95 % as much <b>springtime</b> snow cover <b>loss</b> over Eurasia as anthropogenic carbon dioxide, a consequence of strong snow-albedo feedback and large BC+OM emissions from Asia. 4) Of 22 climate models contributing to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, 21 underpredict the rapid warming (0. 64 &deg;C decade&minus; 1 ) observed over springtime Eurasia since 1979. Darkening from natural and anthropogenic sources of BC and mineral dust exerts 3 -fold greater forcing on springtime snow over Eurasia (3. 9 W m&minus; 2 ) than North America (1. 2 W m&minus; 2 ). Inclusion of this forcing significantly improves simulated continental warming trends, but does not reconcile the low bias in rate of Eurasian spring snow cover decline exhibited by all models, likely because BC deposition trends are negative or near-neutral over much of Eurasia. Improved Eurasian warming may therefore relate more to darkening-induced reduction in mean snow cover...|$|R
40|$|On 11 $^{th}$ February, 1997, the TRIPLE balloon was {{launched}} in Kiruna, Northern Sweden. It ascended into the lower stratosphere, reached a maximum altitude of 24. 1 km and landed in Northern Finland after a 2. 5 -hour flight. Thanks to advantageous meteorological conditions the balloon passed through the edge region of the polar vortex. Moreover, the data of the TRIPLE flight show that on that day a wave event occurred. The edge region of the polar vortex is of interest because {{the phenomenon of the}} polar vortex is closely related to the <b>springtime</b> ozone <b>loss,</b> also known as the ozone hole. Under certain circumstances, the air inside the vortex is forced to remain under polar night conditions for a period of months. Due to the low temperatures reactive chlorine compounds are formed. After the return of sunlight in springtime especially the ClO radical acts as a catalyst of massive ozone depletion. The stability of the polar vortex and the action of the vortex edge as a transport barrier are decisive factors for the extent of ozone depletion. On the gondola of the TRIPLE balloon several instruments were mounted for the measurement of various molecules, among them the ClO/BrO instrument of Research Centre Jülich, an ozone sounding device from the University of Wyoming and the BONBON cryosampler from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main. Consequently it was possible to simultaneously observe the wave event and its consequences for the chemistry in the air masses in question. The measured ClO profile thus acted as an indicator of the lowest temperature experienced by the respective air parcel during the event. As the most probable simultaneous explanation for the observed ClO, temperature and pressure profiles a wave standing perpendicular to the earth’s surface is suggested. Chemistry and transport calculations by means of the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS) support this assumption. A theoretical examination shows that such an event can cause horizontal mixing processes. Indeed, the ozone profile measured on the TRIPLE gondola provides indications of an intrusion of ozone-rich air masses originating from the outer vortex edge area or even from outside the polar vortex. This assumption was verified by the tracer-tracer method utilizing the N 2 O profile of the BONBON cryosampler. Besides these theoretical examinations and considerations, this work also contains a practical part. The working principle of the ClO/BrO instrument, the Chemical Conversion and Resonance Fluorescence (CCRF) method, is explained. The calibration of the instrument and difficulties in measuring BrO by the CCRF method are discussed. Moreover, studies are presented relating {{to the development of the}} HALOX aircraft instrument, a modified version of the balloon instrument which has been operated since the end of 2001 on board the Russian high-altitude research aircraft "Geophysica"...|$|R
40|$|Possible {{causes of}} a future {{increase}} in stratospheric H 2 O are increasing tropospheric methane levels and a rise in tropospheric H- 2 due to leakages from a possible increased integration of hydrogen into the energy supply system. Here we quantify the direct chemical impact of potential future stratospheric H 2 O increases on Arctic ozone loss using the cold Arctic winter 2004 / 2005 {{as the basis for}} our study. We present simulations with the three-dimensional chemistry transport model CLaMS using enhanced stratospheric H 2 O values. Previous studies emphasized that increasing H 2 O concentrations cause stratospheric cooling, and some have suggested that this could significantly increase halogen-induced polar ozone loss. The impact of both increased stratospheric H 2 O values and decreased temperatures on simulated ozone depletion is investigated. Assuming an average increase of water vapor in the lower polar stratosphere of approximate to 0. 58 ppmv (averaged over equivalent latitudes >= 65 degrees N, from 400 - 550 K potential temperature and from December to March) and in addition decreased temperatures (- 0. 2 K) yields at most 6. 8 DU (approximate to 11 %) more accumulated ozone loss in mid-March for the Arctic polar winter 2004 / 2005 compared to the ozone loss for undisturbed conditions. The assumed H 2 O enhancement in future decades is in the range of current model predictions. Considering in addition the decrease of the future chlorine loading (- 40 %) of enhanced H 2 O values (see above) yields at most 3. 4 DU (10 %) of accumulated ozone <b>loss</b> in <b>springtime</b> compared to current H 2 O values. The impact of a potential future hydrogen economy alone (assuming an averaged increase of 0. 18 ppmv H 2 O in the lower stratosphere) on <b>springtime</b> accumulated ozone <b>loss</b> is found to be negligible (at most 2. 5 DU (4 %)) in this study...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} the stratospheric sulfate aerosol layer {{associated}} with the Mt. Pinatubo volcano and future volcanic eruptions on {{the recovery of the}} ozone layer is studied with an interactive two-dimensional photochemical model. The time varying chlorine loading and the stratospheric cooling due to increasing carbon dioxide have been taken into account. The computed ozone and temperature changes associated with the Mt. Pinatubo eruption in 1991 agree well with observations. Long model runs out to the year 2050 have been carried out, in which volcanoes having the characteristics of the Mount Pinatubo volcano were erupted in the model at 10 -year intervals starting in the year 2010. Compared to a non-volcanic run using background aerosol loading, transient reductions of globally averaged column ozone of 2 - 3 percent were computed as a result of each of these eruptions, with the ozone recovering to that computed for the non-volcanic case in about 5 years after the eruption. Computed springtime Arctic column ozone losses of from 10 to 18 percent also recovered to the non-volcanic case within 5 years. These results suggest that the long-term recovery of ozone would not be strongly affected by infrequent volcanic eruptions with a sulfur loading approximating Mt. Pinatubo. Sensitivity studies in which the Arctic lower stratosphere was forced to be 4 K and 10 K colder resulted in transient ozone losses of which also recovered to the non-volcanic case in 5 years. A case in which a volcano five times Mt. Pinatubo was erupted in the year 2010 led to maximum <b>springtime</b> column ozone <b>losses</b> of 45 percent which took 10 years to recover to the background case. Finally, in order to simulate a situation in which frequent smaller volcanic eruptions result in increasing the background sulfate loading, a simulation was made in which the background aerosol was increased by 10 percent per year. This resulted in a delay of the recovery of column ozone to 1980 values of more than 10 years...|$|R
