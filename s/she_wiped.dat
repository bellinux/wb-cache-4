25|$|A similar anointing is {{described}} in the Gospel of Luke as occurring {{at the home of}} one Simon the Pharisee in which a woman who had been sinful all her life, and who was crying, anointed Jesus' feet and, when her tears started to fall on his feet, <b>she</b> <b>wiped</b> them with her hair. Luke's account (as well as John's) differs from that of Matthew and Mark by relating that the anointing is to the feet rather than the head. Although it is a subject of considerable debate, many scholars hold that these actually describe two separate events.|$|E

That's why when she is in the car, and <b>she</b> <b>wipes</b> the glass, <b>she's</b> looking mad sad, distant, thoughtful. But I’m still trying to get her attention. That's kinda the story for it.|$|R

Let us see a glimpse of sunshine in the last chapter; it is quite essential." ...|$|R

40|$|At the {{conclusion}} of Mohammed Dib’s ground-breaking representation of the Algerian War of Independence, Qui se souvient de la mer, at what might be adjudged to represent the final victory of the feminine force that the sea represents, the text attests to the ineluctable bond between ‘la mer’ and ‘la mère’ in the perspective of its representation.

Here, as at many other points in Dib’s narrative, the reader is invited to recall the French nautical saying ‘La mer berce comme la mère’...|$|R
