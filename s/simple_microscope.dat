60|$|The way {{the plant}} really eats is little known to gardeners, but very interesting. All over the lower {{surface of the}} green leaf lie {{scattered}} dozens of tiny mouths or apertures, each of them guarded by two small pursed-up lips which have a ridiculously human appearance when seen through a <b>simple</b> <b>microscope.</b> When the conditions of air and moisture are favourable, these lips open visible to admit gases; and then the tiny mouths suck in carbonic acid in abundance from the air around then. A series of pipes conveys the gaseous food thus supplied to the upper surface of the leaf, where the sunlight falls full upon it. Now, {{the cells of the}} leaf contain a peculiar green digestive material, which I regret to say has no simpler or more cheerful name than chlorophyll; and where the sunlight plays upon this mysterious chlorophyll, it severs the oxygen from the carbon in the carbonic acid, turns the free gas loose upon the atmosphere once more through the tiny mouths, and retains the severed carbon intact in its own tissues. That is the whole process of feeding in plants: they eat carbonic acid, digest it in their leaves, get rid of the oxygen with which it was formerly combined, and keep the carbon stored up for their own purposes.|$|E

50|$|Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1724) is {{credited}} with bringing the microscope {{to the attention of}} biologists, even though simple magnifying lenses were already being produced in the 16th century. Van Leeuwenhoek's home-made <b>microscopes</b> were <b>simple</b> <b>microscopes,</b> with a single very small, yet strong lens. They were awkward in use, but enabled van Leeuwenhoek to see detailed images. It took about 150 years of optical development before the compound microscope was able to provide the same quality image as van Leeuwenhoek's <b>simple</b> <b>microscopes,</b> due to difficulties in configuring multiple lenses. In the 1850s John Leonard Riddell, Professor of Chemistry at Tulane University, invented the first practical binocular microscope while carrying out one of the earliest and most extensive American microscopic investigations of cholera.|$|R
5000|$|Highly skilled English craftsman. Began {{his career}} as an engraver. Later {{dedicated}} himself {{to the construction of}} scientific instruments, achieving fame principally in the optical and mathematical fields. After making <b>simple</b> <b>microscopes,</b> Culpeper turned to tripod-mounted compound microscopes, introducing major changes and improvements in their mechanical and optical systems. Such instruments are known as [...] "Culpeper-type microscopes".|$|R
50|$|The {{discovery}} of the cell was made possible through {{the invention of the}} microscope. In the first century BC, Romans were able to make glass, discovering that objects appeared to be larger under the glass. In Italy during the 12th century, Salvino D’Armate made a piece of glass fit over one eye, allowing for a magnification effect to that eye. The expanded use of lenses in eyeglasses in the 13th century probably led to wider spread use of <b>simple</b> <b>microscopes</b> (magnifying glasses) with limited magnification. Compound microscope, which combine an objective lens with an eyepiece to view a real image achieving much higher magnification, first appeared in Europe around 1620 In 1665, Robert Hooke used a microscope about six inches long with two convex lenses inside and examined specimens under reflected light for the observations in his book Micrographia. Hooke also used a <b>simpler</b> <b>microscope</b> with a single lens for examining specimens with directly transmitted light, because this allowed for a clearer image.|$|R

50|$|A <b>simple</b> <b>microscope</b> uses a lens {{or set of}} lenses {{to enlarge}} an object through angular {{magnification}} alone, giving the viewer an erect enlarged virtual image. The use of a single convex lens or groups of lenses are still found in simple magnification devices such as the magnifying glass, loupes, and eyepieces for telescopes and microscopes.|$|E
5000|$|Zeiss’ first {{compound}} microscopes {{were offered}} in his 5th, 1858, price list.  These {{are described as}} “Small body tube, consisting of a field lens and two oculars with an adaptor to attach the tube to the stand and doublet objectives of stands 1 through 5 to allow use of the doublets as objectives to obtain two stronger magnifications after the fashion of the compound microscope.  The 120 power doublet of the <b>simple</b> <b>microscope</b> yields in this fashion 300 and 600 fold magnification.” ...|$|E

50|$|Magnetic {{sequencing}} is a single-molecule sequencing {{method in}} development. A DNA hairpin, containing {{the sequence of}} interest, is bound between a magnetic bead and a glass surface. A magnetic field is applied to stretch the hairpin open into single strands, and the hairpin refolds after decreasing of the magnetic field. The hairpin length can be determined by direct imaging of the diffraction rings of the magnetic beads using a <b>simple</b> <b>microscope.</b> The DNA sequences are determined by measuring {{the changes in the}} hairpin length following successful hybridization of complementary nucleotides.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two basic}} types of optical microscopes: simple microscopes and {{compound}} microscopes. A <b>simple</b> <b>microscope</b> is one which uses a single lens for magnification, such as a magnifying glass. A compound microscope uses several lenses to enhance the magnification of an object. The vast majority of modern research microscopes are compound microscopes while some cheaper commercial digital microscopes are simple single lens microscopes. Compound microscopes can be further divided {{into a variety of}} other types of microscopes which differ in their optical configurations, cost, and intended purposes.|$|E

50|$|The {{existence}} of microorganisms was predicted many centuries {{before they were}} first observed, for example by the Jains in India and by Marcus Terentius Varro in ancient Rome. The first recorded microscope observation was of the fruiting bodies of moulds, by Robert Hooke in 1666, but the Jesuit priest Athanasius Kircher was likely {{the first to see}} microbes, which he mentioned observing in milk and putrid material in 1658. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek is considered a father of microbiology as he observed and experimented with microscopic organisms in 1676, using <b>simple</b> <b>microscopes</b> of his own design. Scientific microbiology developed in the 19th century through the work of Louis Pasteur and in medical microbiology Robert Koch.|$|R
50|$|The modern {{electronic}} {{scintillation counter}} {{was invented in}} 1944 by Sir Samuel Curran whilst {{he was working on}} the Manhattan Project at the University of California at Berkeley. There was a requirement to measure the radiation from small quantities of uranium and his innovation was to use one of the newly-available highly sensitive photomultiplier tubes made by the Radio Corporation of America to accurately count the flashes of light from a scintillator subjected to radiation.This built upon the work of earlier researchers such as Antoine Henri Becquerel, who discovered radioactivity whilst working on the phosphorescence of uranium salts in 1896. Previously scintillation events had to be laboriously detected by eye using a spinthariscope which was a <b>simple</b> <b>microscope</b> to observe light flashes in the scintillator.|$|E
50|$|Despite Schleiden’s approval, these improvised {{compound}} microscopes {{were not}} a long term solution.  A similar arrangement, as a Brücke’s Loupe, {{would continue to be}} offered for many years with the dissecting stands but the original <b>simple</b> <b>microscope</b> doublets were an inferior substitute for a purpose designed compound microscope achromatic objective.  By the publication of the 7th, 1861, price list in August of 1861, newly developed compound microscopes appear in 5 different versions.  The largest of these, costing 55 Taler, was a horseshoe foot stand as made popular by the well known Parisian microscope maker Georg Oberhaeuser.  Under the object stage Zeiss introduced a domed aperture plate and a mirror mounted to allow not only side to side, but also forward movement to produce oblique illumination.  Each microscope suite was produced to order for his customers so that they could choose their preferred optical components; objectives, oculars and illumination.|$|E
5000|$|Matthias Jacob Schleiden (1804-1881) {{had been}} an {{interested}} patron and advisor since {{the founding of the}} firm, frequently spending hours at the workshops.  He advised Zeiss to concentrate his efforts on the microscope which was critical for the rapidly advancing science of cellular anatomy and very much in demand.  Schleiden had a personal interest as this was his field of study.  As a result of the interaction, the first microscopes products of the workshop, the simple microscopes, were constantly improved.  They were very  favorably reviewed by the influential microscopist and botanist Leopold Dippel (1827-1914).  The optics for the <b>simple</b> <b>microscope</b> included a triplet of 200 fold magnification, for 5 Talers, and one of 300 fold magnification, for 8 Taler.  These pushed the limits of the simple microscope.  Greater magnification would require compound microscopes.  Zeiss would need to expand his offerings if he was not to be made irrelevant by his competitors.|$|E

50|$|Extensive {{microscopic}} {{study was}} done by Anton van Leeuwenhoek, a draper who took the interest in microscopes after seeing one while on an apprenticeship in Amsterdam in 1648. At some {{point in his life}} before 1668, he was able to learn how to grind lenses. This eventually led to Leeuwenhoek making his own unique microscope. His were a single lens <b>simple</b> <b>microscope,</b> rather than a compound microscope. This was because he was able to use a single lens that was a small glass sphere but allowed for a magnification of 270x. This was a large progression since the magnification before was only a maximum of 50x. After Leeuwenhoek, there was not much progress for the microscopes until the 1850s, two hundred years later. Carl Zeiss, a German engineer who manufactured microscopes, began to make changes to the lenses used. But the optical quality did not improve until the 1880s when he hired Otto Schott and eventually Ernst Abbe.|$|E
50|$|Zeiss {{was from}} the {{beginning}} more a fine machinist than an optician.  This meant that he was less constrained by the traditional work methods and thinking of contemporary opticians and more open to innovation.  He decided to pursue the design of microscope optics by theoretical calculation, which expert opinion considered impossible for various reasons. Despite that opinion, Joseph Fraunhofer (1787-1826) had already produced telescope objectives by calculation in 1819, and Josef Maximilian Petzval {{had done the same}} for the camera objective in Vienna with Johann Friedrich Voigtländer in 1840.  Zeiss had already attempted to acquire the required theory in his evening literature studies.  When this failed, he turned to the Jena professor of mathematics,  Friedrich Wilhelm Barfuss, who had worked with his mentor Körner and had already worked successfully on the problem of Zeiss’ <b>simple</b> <b>microscope</b> triplets.  The collaboration continued until the professor’s death, but offered no progress on the compound microscope problem.|$|E
5000|$|The {{compound}} microscope {{was just being}} introduced to serious scientific use as the introduction of achromatic objective lenses made it superior to the <b>simple</b> <b>microscope</b> for research use. [...] Several contemporary publications written for working research scientists and students compared the available microscopes as of their publication dates. Oberhaeuser's objective lenses were consistently judged to be very good. [...] He adopted the system used by Amici of several lenses in fixed sequence where each lens served a purpose in correcting aberrations caused by the overall system. The lenses were not independently usable objectives. [...] Several competitors continued to use the system described by J. J. Lister in his famous paper; stacked independent objectives. The path pioneered by Amici and Oberhaeuser proved more flexible and ultimately became the most common design used in higher magnification objectives. A modern comparison of a Dutch museum collection supports the contemporary evaluations. The later Oberhaeuser objectives show very good resolution even by modern standards.Oberhaeuser continued to develop stands to suit the requirements of researchers and introduced the pattern which was to shape {{the image of the}} microscope for over a century in 1854; the Oberhaeuser horseshoe foot stand.|$|E
50|$|All of the {{experiments}} have led {{to at least one}} common conclusion: colloidal crystals may indeed mimic their atomic counterparts on appropriate scales of length (spatial) and time (temporal). Defects have been reported to flash by {{in the blink of an}} eye in thin films of colloidal crystals under oil using a <b>simple</b> optical <b>microscope.</b> But quantitatively measuring the rate of its propagation provides an entirely different challenge, which has been measured at somewhere near the speed of sound.|$|R
50|$|Janssen {{has been}} {{associated}} with the invention of the single-lens (<b>simple)</b> optical <b>microscope</b> and the compound (2 or more lens) 9x magnification optical microscope, sometimes claimed to have been devised {{with the help of his}} father (or sometimes said to have been built entirely by his father) with a date of invention commonly given as 1590 (or sometimes 1595), while trying to find a way to make magnification even greater to help people with seriously poor eyesight.|$|R
40|$|Jan Swammerdam as microscopist Contrary to {{the usual}} opinion, Jan Swammerdam, after the period of mysticism, resumed his {{scientific}} work. He worked very hard during the last period of his life (1676 - 80), though he was no more fit for field research. He now collected and enlarged his manuscripts and made them ready for press; they were published by Boerhaave as the Biblia Naturae (1737 - 38). Moreover in these years he applied himself in particular to microscopical examinations. In his earlier days he had used a magnifying glass made by Van Musschenbroek. but now he made his <b>simple</b> <b>microscopes</b> himself after a method he had learnt from Joh. Hudde. They were, in fact, very small glass globules which also later have been shown by P. Harting {{to have a great}} magnifying power (800 - 2200 x). They enabled Swammerdam to study the inner structure of insects and, in 1678, the red blood cells (already observed by Leeuwenhoek some years previously) and their oval form. Furthermore he describd the spermatozoa in a dog some months after Leeuwenhoek had studied them first. He recognized Leeuwenhoek's priorities, but the two naturalists had too little appreciation for each other's merits...|$|R
