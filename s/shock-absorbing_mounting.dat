40|$|Abstract. In the paperwas {{examined}} {{the impact of}} biconnectivity of oscillations of single-mass system on the dynamic factor under unsteady dynamic impact. We consider shock-absorbing ability of the anchors of the object {{in the case of}} biconnectivity of oscillations {{and in the absence of}} the upper links (Fig. 1). The effectiveness of the protection is estimated relatively to the fixing scheme, which includes upper links, near which oscillations are unconnected. Scheme without the upper links in calculating is often replaced by the second scheme, where these links are present that leads to the simplification of calculations, but brings the error in the determination of motion parameters. The similar issue was considered in the works of Thomas, Berg, Stichel[1] and Jeary [2]. Let us estimate the value of this error. Fig. 1 Amortized solid body We consider impact to be presetted by the acceleration of its basement Ψ or by its moving Ψ. 1. <b>Shock-absorbing</b> <b>mounting</b> with permanent stiffness. The equation of motion in the case of links with permanent stiffness in the absence of upper links is the following [3]...|$|E
50|$|The Kurir has a fixed, {{tailwheel}} undercarriage. The two tall, long-stroke, <b>shock-absorbing</b> main legs <b>mounted</b> on {{the upper}} fuselage sides just forward of the cabin have supplementary bracing; each carries a wheel fitted with brakes. Alternatively, skis can be fitted. At least one was configured as a floatplane.|$|R
2500|$|It {{features}} an egg-shaped crew capsule nicknamed the [...] "blast bucket". It is shaped to deflect blasts and bullets {{and act as}} a roll-cage if the vehicle flips. The four occupants sit back to back in a diamond arrangement {{so that they can}} see hazards from all directions, a suggestion from troops in the field. It also moves the occupants away from the wheels, which are typically what sets off a land mine. The Ultra AP includes race car technology from NASCAR engineers like multipoint safety harnesses and <b>shock-absorbing</b> seats <b>mounted</b> on Skydex, which is used to cushion the outfield walls of baseball stadiums. It also uses the latest in bulletproof glass and the newest light-weight armor technology.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{is constructed}} from Kevlar-reinforced fibreglass with steel tube reinforcement {{in the cockpit}} area. The seating is for pilot and passenger in side-by-side configuration, sharing a centre-mounted control stick. The landing gear is of tricycle configuration, with curved main gear legs made from fibreglass and a nosewheel mounted on steel tubes with rubber puck shock absorbing. There is also a <b>shock-absorbing</b> tail skid <b>mounted</b> under the fin. While the fin is fibreglass the horizontal stabilizer, elevator and adjustable trim tab mounted as a T-tail are all aluminum.|$|R
50|$|The NiD 580's angular {{empennage}} was conventional, with a straight-tapered tailplane and elevators {{mounted on}} top of the fuselage. The fin was triangular and carried a nearly rectangular rudder, hinged behind the elevators, above the keel. It had a fixed, conventional undercarriage with mainwheels on axles at the vertices of faired V-struts hinged on the fuselage at the ends of the wing struts. On each side, a <b>shock-absorbing</b> leg was <b>mounted</b> on the forward wing strut at a point strengthened by two short struts, one to the upper fuselage longeron and one to the rear wing strut mounting point.|$|R
