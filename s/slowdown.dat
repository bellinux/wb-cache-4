40|$|This paper proposes an {{explicit}} test {{for determining the}} significance and the timing of <b>slowdowns</b> in economic growth. We examine a large sample of countries and find that a majority - though not all - exhibit a significant structural break in their postwar growth rates. We find that (a) most industrialized countries experienced postwar growth <b>slowdowns</b> in the early 1970 s, though (b) the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom did not, and (c) developing countries (and in particular, Latin American countries) tended to experience much more severe <b>slowdowns</b> which, {{in contrast with the}} more developed countries, began nearly a decade later. © 1998 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technolog...|$|R

5|$|Construction of Selfe's {{version of}} the Sydney harbour bridge never started due to an {{economic}} <b>slowdown</b> and a change of government at the 1904 state election. Much to Selfe's outrage, the Department of Public Works kept his calculations and drawings, and also copied and printed them. Eventually in 1907, the department contacted Selfe {{and asked him to}} collect his drawings, but refused to return the calculations. Selfe was never given the £1,100 prize, nor was he paid for his subsequent work which he estimated to be worth more than £20,000.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we first {{estimate}} the {{growth rates of}} real per capita GDP, real per capita Consumption, and Productivity (real GDP per worker) for the following panels of countries: (1) OPEC countries, (2) industrialized countries, and (3) based on geographic location. We then test for a structural change in the growth rates for each group and also attempt to identify the change point for each group. If {{there is a significant}} change, then the growth rates are estimated before and after the break for comparison. It is found that industrial countries, in general, experienced <b>slowdowns</b> in growth in the early 1970 s, whereas less developed countries also experienced <b>slowdowns</b> in growth, but the timing of the <b>slowdowns</b> was in the mid to late 1970 s. ...|$|R

5|$|Dayton's {{population}} declined {{significantly from}} a peak of 262,332 residents in 1960 to only 141,527 in 2010. This was in part due to the <b>slowdown</b> of the region's manufacturing and the growth of Dayton's affluent suburbs including Oakwood, Englewood, Beavercreek, Springboro, Miamisburg, Kettering, and Centerville. The city's most populous ethnic group, white, declined from 78.1% in 1960 to 51.7% by 2010. However, recent census estimates show a 1.3% population increase since 2010, the first increase in five decades.|$|E
5|$|Following Indian {{independence}} in 1947, Kalimpong {{became part of}} the state of West Bengal, after Bengal was partitioned between India and East Pakistan. With China's annexation of Tibet in 1959, many Buddhist monks fled Tibet and established monasteries in Kalimpong. These monks brought many rare Buddhist scriptures with them. In 1962, the permanent closure of the Jelep Pass after the Sino-Indian War disrupted trade between Tibet and India, and led to a <b>slowdown</b> in Kalimpong's economy. In 1976, the visiting Dalai Lama consecrated the Zang Dhok Palri Phodang monastery, which houses many of the scriptures.|$|E

5|$|Several {{studies found}} that the {{financial}} crisis and accompanying recession could {{not account for the}} entirety of the <b>slowdown</b> and that structural changes likely share at least partial credit.

Paul Krawzak claimed that even if cost controls succeed in reducing the amount spent on healthcare, such efforts on their own may be insufficient to outweigh the long-term burden placed by demographic changes, particularly the growth of the population on Medicare.|$|E

5|$|After a brief <b>slowdown</b> of {{the economy}} {{at the end of}} the Depression, the country entered World War II, which renewed the {{importance}} of railroads. The rails were essential to transport gasoline and scrap metal to build military vehicles, so Meridian became the region's rail center again. This renewed prosperity continued until the 1950s, when the affordability of automobiles and the subsidized Interstate Highway System drew off passengers from the trains. The decline of the railroad industry, which went through considerable restructuring among freight lines as well, caused significant job losses. The city's population declined as workers left for other areas.|$|E
40|$|The 1990 {{recession}} had {{a significant}} impact on the financial landscape both in the United States and in the rest of the world.

5|$|In {{recent years}} the Dutch brick {{industry}} has attracted unwelcome attention from the European Union (EU) competition authorities. In the early 1990s the industry had excess capacity due to technological advances, competition from other materials and an economic <b>slowdown.</b> Producers with combined market share of 90% agreed to reduce capacity, shutting down the older and inefficient plants. The producers compensated those who closed plants. However, the agreement also included fixing production quotas and fining members who produced more than their quota. The members of what was in effect a cartel were forced to drop the quota agreement by the EU.|$|E
5|$|Keynes {{contended that}} {{economic}} output is {{positively correlated with}} money velocity. He explained the relationship via changing liquidity preferences: people increase their money holdings during times of economic difficulty by reducing their spending, which further slows the economy. This paradox of thrift claimed that individual attempts to survive a downturn only worsen it. When the demand for money increases, money velocity slows. A <b>slowdown</b> in economic activities means markets might not clear, leaving excess goods to waste and capacity to idle. Turning the quantity theory on its head, Keynes argued that market changes shift quantities rather than prices. Keynes replaced the assumption of stable velocity with one of a fixed price-level. If spending falls and prices do not, the surplus of goods reduces the need for workers and increases unemployment.|$|E

It is possible to find some cases in which <b>slowdowns</b> increase, when a manager in a firm enforces penalties for workers have <b>slowdowns.</b> This phenomenon occurs because a worker prefers the position of equilibrium on the labor supply function always in the upper direction.

40|$|We report two {{experiments}} examining first/second-person blocking {{effects on}} the Chinese long-distance reflexive ziji during on-line processing. Participants read sentences with varying matrix and embedded subjects (Exp 1 : 1 st-person pronoun/ 3 rd-person name; Exp 2 : 2 nd-person pronoun/ 3 rd-person name) and answered comprehension questions probing their interpretations of ziji. Work on English found that structurally inaccessible referents can cause competition at the reflexive, indicated by reading-time <b>slowdowns</b> (Badecker and Straub 2002). In Exp 1, the 1 st-person blocking condition (3 rd-person matrix/ 1 st-person embedded) exhibited <b>slowdowns</b> and a higher-than-expected rate of matrix-subject-interpretations, suggesting 1 st-person blocking is not consistently effective. However, the subset of trials with effective blocking (local-antecedent interpretations) revealed no <b>slowdowns.</b> In Exp 2, the 2 nd-person blocking condition (3 rd-person matrix/ 2 nd-person embedded) showed consistent blocking and no significant <b>slowdowns.</b> Our results suggest that referents’ ability to compete depends not only on prominence (Badecker and Straub 2002) but also how it is blocked (person-feature vs. syntactic barrier). Building upon Brunyé et al. ’s (2009) finding that 2 nd-person pronouns are more effective at triggering perspective-taking than 1 st-person pronouns, we suggest {{that the difference between}} first- and second- person blocking may be attributable to perspective taking: Identifying with the 2 nd-person addressee leads comprehenders to more consistently interpret the reflexive as referring to the local 2 nd-person subject, resulting in a consistent blocking effect...|$|R
