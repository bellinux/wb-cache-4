40|$|AbstractGeometric {{dimensioning}} and Tolerancing (GDT) {{constitutes the}} dominant approach for design and manufacture of mechanical parts that control inevitable dimensional and geometrical deviations within appropriate limits. The <b>stack</b> up of <b>tolerances</b> and their redistribution without hampering the functionality {{is very important}} for cost optimization. This paper presents a methodology that aims towards the systematic solution of <b>tolerance</b> <b>stack</b> up problem involving geometric characteristics. Conventional <b>tolerance</b> <b>stack</b> up analysis is usually difficult as it involves numerous rule and conditions. The methodology presented i. e. generic capsule method is straightforward and easy to use for stack up of geometrical tolerances of components and their assembly using graphical approach. In the work presented in this paper, angularity tolerance has been considered for illustration of the methodology. Two approaches viz. Worst Case (WC) and Root Sum Square (RSS) have been used. An example of dovetail mounting mechanism has been taken for purpose of stack up of angularity. This assembly consists of two parts i. e. dovetail male and dovetail female. <b>Tolerance</b> <b>stack</b> up has been done both for the components and their assembly. Need for computerisation of methodology for geometrical <b>tolerance</b> <b>stack</b> up of large assemblies has emerged out as the limitation of the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{describe}} various <b>tolerance</b> <b>stacking</b> methods without going into the theoretical details and derivations behind them. For those the reader is referred to Scholz (1995). For each method we present the assumptions and then give the <b>tolerance</b> <b>stacking</b> formulas. This will allow the user to make an informed choice among the manyavailable methods. The methods covered are: worst case or arithmetic tolerancing, simple statistical tolerancing or the RSS method, RSS methods with inflation factors which account for nonnormal distributions, tolerancing with mean shifts, where the latter are stacked arithmeticallyor statisticallyin different ways, depending on how one views the tradeoff between part to part variation and mean shifts...|$|R

40|$|The EU-funded {{research}} project Stack-Test has developed different test {{procedures for the}} functional and performance characterization of PEMFC stacks. The test procedures are based on test modules related to the variation of one test input parameter and {{the determination of the}} influence on the stack performance. These test modules are suitable for all stack applications and have a general nature. The procedure for parameter variation, the critical parameters and the test parameters of interest for the performance characterization have been defined. The following test modules are available: -	Humidity, temperature, and lambda sensitivity -	Pressure sensitivity (exemplarily presented) -	Fuel/oxidant composition -	Freeze start -	Continuous operation at constant load -	Polarization curve -	Impact of ambient conditions -	Electrochemical methods -	Dead end operation The objective and scope of the test modules will be presented {{and the nature of the}} test modules will be demonstrated using an exemplary module. Furthermore, application specific test programs have been developed in the project. These test programs are focusing automotive, stationary and portable applications. Different test modules are combined to a test program and parameter sets are suggested for each application.

40|$|In this paper, a {{platform}} geometrical sensitivity value for a part has been defined. Calculation and simulation {{methods have been}} defined and tested {{to be used in}} industrial “real-life” environments. Present calculation and simulation methods for assembly analysis in a single product development have been used as a basis. These methods have been further developed and adapted to suit product family development, or platforms. The assembly geometrical sensitivity value can be used to predict the effect of <b>tolerance</b> <b>stacking</b> without having data of tolerance sizes available. Using sensitivity calculation in each assembly step gives an indication of the risk of functional failure and non-fulfilled specifications due to <b>tolerance</b> <b>stacking.</b> The platform geometrical sensitivity value could be used for optimization of a part or an assembly, by means of geometric variation, not only for one product environment but also for a complete product family simultaneously. This decreases the risk of sub-optimization of part location and assembly concepts. Using the platform geometrical sensitivity value, the effect of <b>tolerance</b> <b>stacking</b> could be predicted for all assemblies conceptually and the result can be used to dimension specific part tolerances. All equations and mathematical connections are described in detail in the paper but, due to the mathematical complexity of 3 D modeling, the calculations have been performed in a geometry simulation tool.

50|$|Tolerance {{analysis}} {{is the general}} term for activities related {{to the study of}} potential accumulated variation in mechanical parts and assemblies. Its methods may be used on other types of systems subject to accumulated variation, such as mechanical and electrical systems. Engineers analyze tolerances for the purpose of evaluating geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T). Methods include 2D <b>tolerance</b> <b>stacks,</b> 3D Monte Carlo simulations, and datum conversions.|$|R
40|$|The <b>tolerance</b> <b>stacking</b> problem {{arises in}} the context of {{assemblies}} from interchangeable parts because of the inability to produce or to join parts exactly according to nominal dimensions. Either the relevant part 2 ̆ 7 s dimension varies around some nominal values from part to part or the act of assembly that leads to variation. For example, as runner of Francis turbine is joined with turbine shaft via mechanical lock, there is not only variation in the diameter of runner and the concentricity between the runner hole and turbine shaft, but also the variation in concentricity between the outer parts of runner to runner hole. Thus, there is the possibility that the assembly of such interacting parts won 2 ̆ 7 t function or won 2 ̆ 7 t come together as planned. Research in this area has been conducted and 2 mini hydro Francis turbines (800 kW and 910 kW) have been designed and manufactured for San Sarino and Sawi Dago 2 in Central Sulawesi. Experiences in analyzing the <b>tolerance</b> <b>stacks</b> have been documented. In this paper it will be demonstrated how the requirements of assembling performance are derived to be the designed tolerances of each interacting component, {{such a way that the}} assembling would be functioning and come together as planned...|$|R
40|$|A new optimal {{approach}} for planar tolerance allocation is proposed in which dimensional and orientation geometric specifications are included. To {{deal with the}} increased complexity of planar tolerance analysis, a special relevance graph (SRG) is used to represent the relationships between manufactured elements and their size and tolerance information. In addition, the SRG is also applied for the geometric dimensions and tolerances. Using a suitable algorithm, planar tolerance chains that include geometric specifications can be generated automatically during process planning. Through a graph based analysis, <b>stacks</b> of <b>tolerance</b> zones are obtained. The resultant tolerance Zone contains all of the composite links of the tolerance zones. The links are assigned according to the process capacities, which {{can be considered as}} constraints. A linear optimal model is established to solve the tolerance allocation problem.

40|$|During routine {{inspections}} of the Space Shuttle's Main Propulsion System (MPS) Liquid Oxygen (LO 2) pre-valve, the mechanism provided {{to maintain the}} valve {{in the open position}} was found cracked. The mechanism is a Vespel roller held against the valve visor by a stack of Belleville springs. The roller has been found cracked 3 times. All three instances were in the same valve in the same location. There are 6 pre-valves on each orbiter, and only one has exhibited this problem. Every-flight inspections were instituted and the rollers were found to be cracked after only one flight. Engineers at Marshall Space Flight Center, Johnson Space Center and Kennedy Space Center worked together to determine a solution. There were several possible contributors to the failure: a mis-aligned visor, an out of specification edge with a sharp radius, an out of specification <b>tolerance</b> <b>stack</b> up of a Belleville spring stack that caused un-predicted loads on the Vespel SP- 21 roller, and a dimple machined {{into the side of the}} roller to indicate LO 2 compatibility that created a stress riser.

40|$|A {{system was}} {{developed}} to measure the sway of the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) at Kennedy Space Center. This system was installed in the VAB and gathered more than one total year of data. The building movement was correlated with measurements provided by three wind towers {{in order to determine}} the maximum deflection of the building during high-wind events. The VAB owners were in the process of obtaining new platforms for use in assembling very tall rockets when analysis of the VAB showed that a high wind could move the building sufficiently that an upper platform might impact a rocket. The problem arises because safety requires a relatively small gap between the platform and the rocket, while a large enough gap is needed to ensure that <b>stacking</b> <b>tolerances</b> prevent contact between the rocket and the platform. This only leaves an inch or two (approximately 2 to 5 cm) of total clearance, so when the analysis showed that more than a couple of inches of motion could occur in a high wind, there was a potential for damaging the rocket. The KSC Applied Physics Laboratory was asked to install a system in the VAB that could measure the motion of the building in high winds to determine the actual building sway. The motion of the VAB roof under wind load was measured optically, and under analysis, it was determined that a relatively large-aperture optical system would be required to reduce diffraction effects to less than a small fraction of an inch (approximately mm) at a distance of 500 ft (150 m). A 10 -in. (approximately 250 mm) telescope was placed on the floor of the building, looking at the ceiling. On the ceiling, a flat plate with three white LEDs was mounted in an "L" shape, such that the telescope was essentially looking at three stars. Software was written to track the motion of these three points using an image processing system. This provided a better than 1 / 10 -in. (approximately 2. 5 -mm) 2 D measurement faster than once a second. Data was downloaded once a month for comparison with the wind tower data. The system was fully operational and provided enough data to show that the VAB will only move 1 in. (approximately 2. 5 cm) at the ceiling under 70 -knot winds.

The aircraft have been flying research missions since the early 1960 's, and continue to be an asset to the scientific community with professional, reliable, customer-oriented service designed to meet all scientific objectives. The NASA WB- 57 Program provides unique, high-altitude airborne platforms to US Government agencies, academic institutions, and commercial customers in order to support scientific research and advanced technology development and testing at locations around the world. Mission examples include atmospheric and earth science, ground mapping, cosmic dust collection, rocket launch support, and test bed operations for future airborne or spaceborne systems. During the return from a 6 hour flight, at 30, 000 feet, in the clean configuration, traveling at 175 knots indicated airspeed, in un-accelerated flight with the auto pilot engaged, in calm air, the 2 -man crew heard a mechanical bang and felt a slight shudder followed by a few seconds of high frequency vibration. The crew did not notice any other abnormalities leading up to, or for the remaining 1 hour of flight and made an uneventful landing. Upon taxi into the chocks, the recovery ground crew noticed the high frequency long wire antenna had become disconnected from the vertical stabilizer and was trailing over the left inboard wing, and that the left engine upper center removable cowling panel was missing, with noticeable damage to the left engine inboard cowling fixed structure. The missing cowling panel was never recovered. Each engine cowling panel is attached to the engine nacelle using six bushings made of 17 - 4 PH steel. The cylinder portions of four of the six bushings were found still attached to the aircraft (Fig 1). The other two bushings were lost with the panel. The other four bushings exhibited ratchet marks (multiple fatigue origins) which initiated in the sharp radius of the flange/cylinder fillet and were observed 300 degrees around the flange perimeter (Fig 2 - 3). Low stress, high cycle fatigue (HCF) was observed on the fracture surfaces of all four bushings (Fig 4).

50|$|Almost all {{engineering}} drawings (except perhaps reference-only views or initial sketches) communicate {{not only}} geometry (shape and location) but also {{dimensions and tolerances}} for those characteristics. Several systems of dimensioning and tolerancing have evolved. The simplest dimensioning system just specifies distances between points (such as an object's length or width, or hole center locations). Since the advent of well-developed interchangeable manufacture, these distances have been accompanied by tolerances of the plus-or-minus or min-and-max-limit types. Coordinate dimensioning involves defining all points, lines, planes, and profiles in terms of Cartesian coordinates, with a common origin. Coordinate dimensioning was the sole best option until the post-World War II era saw the development of geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T), which departs from the limitations of coordinate dimensioning (e.g., rectangular-only <b>tolerance</b> zones, <b>tolerance</b> <b>stacking)</b> to allow the most logical tolerancing of both geometry and dimensions (that is, both form shapes/locations and sizes).|$|R

The stackup conditions based on worst case (WC) model and RSS model are not realistic in general, though these have been widely used in research because of their simplicity. To account for the realistic nature of the process distribution, a few modifications to these traditional approaches have been proposed. In this paper some nontraditional stack up condition methods like modified RSS Spott’s model and EMS are also analyzed to calculate accumulation of tolerance in assembly. A comparative cost analysis of different stack up models is solved by the combined Simulated Annealing and Pattern Search (SA-PS) algorithm.

The combined cooling and cathode air allows for a reduction in part count and hence a lower cost solution. However, efficient heat rejection challenges escalate as power and ambient temperature increase. For applications in ambient temperatures below freezing, the air-cooled approach has additional challenges associated with not overcooling the fuel cell stack. The focus of this project was freeze tolerance while maintaining all other stack and system requirements. Through this project, Plug Power advanced {{the state of the art}} in technology for air-cooled PEM fuel cell stacks and related GenDrive material handling application fuel cell systems. This was accomplished through a collaborative work plan to improve freeze tolerance and mitigate freeze-thaw effect failure modes within innovative material handling equipment fuel cell systems designed for use in freezer forklift applications.

40|$|Virtually all {{manufacturing}} processes {{are subject to}} variability, an inherent characteristic of most production processes. No two parts can ever be exactly the same {{in terms of their}} dimensions. For machining processes such as drilling, milling, and lathing, overall variability is caused in part by machine tools, tooling, fixtures and workpiece material. Since variability, which can be accumulated from <b>tolerance</b> <b>stacking,</b> can result in defective parts the number of parts produced in a batch is limited. When there are too many parts in a batch, the likelihood of producing all acceptable parts in a batch decreases due to the increased tolerances. On the other hand, too small a batch size incurs an increase of manufacturing costs due to frequent setups and tool replacements, whereas the likelihood of acceptable parts increases. To address this challenge, we present a stochastic model for determining the optimal batch size where we consider part-to-part variation in terms of tool wear, which tends to be proportional to batch size.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a computer program}} for process planning and fixture design. It utilizes the principles of workpiece control, in particular dimensional and geometric control, to sequence the machining operations and to design the 3 - 2 - 1 location systems. The system developed uses the matrix spatial representation, a series of two-dimensional arrays, to describe the workpiece geometry. The system is capable of sequencing three types of machined features requiring milling operations: plane surfaces, slots, and steps. These features may be regarded as two-dimensional type: they can be completely specified dimensionally in two orthogonal projection views. Other data required by the system include the surfaces to be machined, cutting conditions, dimensions and tolerances of the stock and of the finished part. These data are either interactively input into the system or stored in a prepared data file for the system to read. The outputs include the process picture showing all locating surfaces in the 3 - 2 - 1 location system for each operation, {{and a set of}} three tolerance charts for analysing all dimensions of the machined part. The results of this research indicate that the automatic machining sequence planning can be achieved through the implementation of the concept of workpiece control together with the practicality in machining a machined feature. The research also emphasises a significant role of the tolerance charts which have been used in manual process planning for a long time, but have not yet been exploited to its full advantage in computerised process planning. Regarding tolerance charts, the research has developed a new method for calculating <b>tolerance</b> <b>stacks</b> which can be used for computerized as well as manual charting.

40|$|Glyphosate is a broad-spectrum {{herbicide}} used post-emergence. Since {{the introduction}} of the first glyphosate-tolerant crops in 1996, glyphosate has grown to become the most widely used agricultural herbicide. Widespread use of this herbicide as the primary or only chemical mode of action for weed control has driven evolution of twenty-two resistant weed species throughout the world. In response, chemical companies like Dow AgroSciences and Monsanto are developing genetically modified crops that have stacked resistance to 2, 4 -D or dicamba plus other herbicides, with the thinking that tolerance to extra modes of action will give growers another tool to use to combat glyphosate resistant weeds, both in an extra mode of action and in an expanded application window. However, having potentially millions of hectares planted in crops tolerant to auxinic herbicides raises concerns about drift of these herbicides on to sensitive horticultural crops. ^ In 2010 and 2011, three experiments were established near Lafayette, IN, {{to determine the effects of}} low dose applications of 2, 4 -D and dicamba on watermelon (Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsumura 2 ̆ 6 Nakai), muskmelon (Cucumis melo L.), fresh market tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) and bell pepper (Capsicum annuum L.). Plants were treated with full and partial rates of 2, 4 -D and dicamba alone and with mixes partial rates of these herbicides plus glyphosate. Measurements included estimated plant injury at 3, 7, 14 and 21 days after treatment (DAT), yield by harvest date and total yield over the season. The potential economic impact of drift was calculated as part of the analysis. ^ Results showed that all application rates of 2, 4 -D and dicamba caused plant foliar injury to all species tested. Injury generally increased over the rating period, but plants treated with the partial rates recovered over the growing season and produced fruit. Muskmelon plants treated with 2, 4 -D or dicamba displayed delayed fruit maturity and lower total yield than untreated plants. Potential total economic losses for muskmelon exposed to 2, 4 -D were as high as 8357 per hectare (ha), and potential losses for muskmelon exposed to dicamba were as high as 5541 ha- 1 over the season. Total yields for watermelon plants exposed to 2, 4 -D or dicamba were not different from untreated plants in any experiment. Fruit maturity was delayed for plants exposed to 2, 4 -D in all experiments and plants exposed to dicamba in 2011, but plants exposed to dicamba in 2010 did not experience fruit maturity delay. Untreated watermelon plants produced the most total income only when compared to 2, 4 -D treated plants in 2011, when the potential income loss was 4554 ha- 1. Pepper plants exposed to both 2, 4 -D and dicamba experienced delayed fruit maturity compared to untreated plants, although total yield over the season was not different among the treated and untreated plants. Potential economic losses for peppers exposed to 2, 4 -D were as high as 2017 ha- 1 over the season, and total potential losses from dicamba exposure were as high as 2466 ha- 1. Tomato plants exposed to 2, 4 -D or dicamba experienced some fruit maturity delay, but total harvests for both years were not different among treated and untreated plants. Untreated plants did not produce the most potential total income in either year or for either herbicide, although untreated plants did generate the most income at the first harvest for all experiments. ^ This data shows that companies like Dow AgroSciences and Monsanto who produce crops with <b>stacked</b> herbicide <b>tolerance</b> that includes tolerance to 2, 4 -D or dicamba need to be aware of the potential for income reductions for crops exposed to drift of these herbicides. Growers of sensitive crops exposed to drift of auxinic herbicides can experience a delay or reduction in early season income and in some cases reduced total income for the season. It is vital that these companies have plans in place to help growers reduce drift potential and be prepared to effectively deal with drift complaints. ...|$|R
