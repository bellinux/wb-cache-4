Unlike air brakes, where a valve {{is opened}} and air {{flows into the}} lines and brake {{chambers}} until the pressure rises sufficiently, hydraulic systems rely on a single <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>piston</b> to force fluid through the system.If any vapor is introduced into the system it will compress, and the pressure may not rise sufficiently to actuate the brakes.|$|E

50|$|Wankel engines can be {{classified}} by their geometric size in terms of radius (rotor center to tip distance, also the median stator radius) and depth (rotor thickness), and offset (crank throw, eccentricity, also 1/4 the difference between stator's major and minor axes). These metrics function similarly to the bore and <b>stroke</b> measurements <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>piston</b> engine. Displacement is 3√3radius·offset·depth, multiplied {{with the number of}} rotors (note that this only counts <b>a</b> single face <b>of</b> each rotor as the entire rotor's displacement). Nearly all Mazda production Wankel engines share a single rotor radius, 105 mm (4.1 in), with a 15 mm (0.6 in) crankshaft offset. The only engine to diverge from this formula was the rare 13A, which used a 120 mm (4.7 in) rotor radius and 17.5 mm (0.7 in) crankshaft offset.|$|R

40|$|Physical {{constraints}} need to {{be considered}} in the design of control systems for an oscillating body Wave Energy Converter (WEC). In the case <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hydraulic Power Take Off (PTO) unit, such constraints include the length <b>of</b> the <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hydraulic <b>piston</b> or the maximum pressure permitted in the hydraulic circuit. In the paper, two types of WEC are considered: A 1 -body point absorber oscillating in heave and a 2 -body point absorber also oscillating in heave. A procedure for the analysis of the constraints is presented. It provides sufficient conditions for the satisfaction of both constraints and/or the violation of at least one constraint. The procedure is based on the discretization of the equations of motion of the WECs by approximating the forces and the velocities with <b>a</b> linear combination <b>of</b> basis functions. <b>A</b> special case is presented in which truncated Fourier series are used for the approximation. It is shown that the constraints can be interpreted as a geometrical object in a finite dimensional vector space, and that the study of sufficient conditions for the satisfaction of both constraints and for sufficient conditions for the violation of at least one constraint {{can be seen as the}} study of the intersection between these geometrical objects. It is also shown that the method allows the study of the effect of constraints on the amount of produced energy...|$|R
25|$|In the Wankel engine, {{the four}} <b>strokes</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Otto cycle <b>piston</b> engine {{occur in the}} space between a three-sided {{symmetric}} rotor and the inside <b>of</b> <b>a</b> housing. In each rotor of the Wankel engine, the oval-like epitrochoid-shaped housing surrounds a rotor which is triangular with bow-shaped flanks (often confused with a Reuleaux triangle, <b>a</b> three-pointed curve <b>of</b> constant width, but with the bulge in the middle <b>of</b> each side <b>a</b> bit more flattened). The theoretical shape of the rotor between the fixed corners is the result <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minimization <b>of</b> the volume of the geometric combustion chamber and <b>a</b> maximization <b>of</b> the compression ratio, respectively. The symmetric curve connecting two arbitrary apexes of the rotor is maximized {{in the direction of the}} inner housing shape with the constraint that it not touch the housing at any angle <b>of</b> rotation (<b>an</b> arc is not <b>a</b> solution <b>of</b> this optimization problem).|$|R
50|$|Tuning up {{an early}} {{generation}} FSI power plant to generate higher power is difficult, since {{the only time}} {{it is possible to}} inject fuel is during the induction phase. Conventional injection engines can inject throughout the 4-stroke sequence, as the injector squirts onto the back <b>of</b> <b>a</b> closed valve. A direct injection engine, where the injector injects directly into the cylinder, is limited to the intake <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> the <b>piston.</b> <b>As</b> the RPM increases, the time available to inject fuel decreases. Newer FSI systems that have sufficient fuel pressure to inject even late in compression phase do not suffer to the same extent. However, they do not inject during the exhaust cycle because doing so would waste fuel. Hence, all other factors being equal, an FSI engine needs higher-capacity injectors to achieve the same power as a conventional engine. Some engines overcome this limitation by using both direct injection and multiport fuel injection, including Toyota 2GR-FSE V6 and Volkswagen Group TSI Engines.|$|R
