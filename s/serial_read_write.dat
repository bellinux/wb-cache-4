40|$|Author(s) 2015. The NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) library {{has become}} an {{indispensable}} tool for data and model output management in geoscience. However for simple tasks, particularly in Fortran, the complexity of native NetCDF functionality can be cumbersome. The NCIO (NetCDF Input/Output) module has been designed as an interface to the NetCDF library with simplicity {{and ease of use}} in mind. While this implies that some NetCDF functionality is masked from the user, the subroutines provided here are adequate for basic <b>serial</b> <b>reading</b> and <b>writing</b> tasks of up to 6 -D data arrays along with corresponding data attributes. The code is available online via a GitHub repository ([URL] which includes an example program to illustrate the approach. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

50|$|Reentrant {{functions}} {{can work}} with global data. For example, a reentrant interrupt service routine could grab a piece of hardware status to work with (e.g. <b>serial</b> port <b>read</b> buffer) which is not only global, but volatile. Still, typical use of static variables and global data is not advised, {{in the sense that}} only atomic read-modify-write instructions should be used in these variables (it should not be possible for an interrupt or signal to come during the execution of such an instruction). Note that in C, even a <b>read</b> or <b>write</b> is not guaranteed to be atomic; it may be split into several <b>reads</b> or <b>writes.</b> The C standard and SUSv3 provide sig_atomic_t for this purpose, although with guarantees only for simple <b>reads</b> and <b>writes,</b> not for incrementing or decrementing. More complex atomic operations are available in C11, which provides stdatomic.h.|$|R

The purpose {{of the project was}} to provide machine-readable economic and social history statistics relating to the whole of Ireland for the period 1821 - 1971. Further information about the project is available on the QUB Centre for Data Digitisation and Analysis website. Main Topics : The main tables are: Total number of persons who could <b>read</b> and <b>write,</b> <b>read</b> only, or neither <b>read</b> nor <b>write,</b> grouped by baronies and gender (1841 - 1861). Total number of persons who could <b>read</b> and <b>write,</b> <b>read</b> only, or neither <b>read</b> nor <b>write,</b> grouped by counties, gender and age groups (1841, 1901 - 1911).

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} is the widespread phenomenon of learning to <b>read,</b> <b>write</b> and count in early childhood around the District of Wiradesa, Pekalongan. Why such a phenomenon appears? How the model of learning to <b>read,</b> <b>write</b> and count in early childhood around the District of Wiradesa, Pekalongan? And how it impacts their ability to <b>read,</b> <b>write</b> and count and their psychological. To answer these questions, observation, in-depth interview and documentation were used in this study. To analysis data, review and reflection, exploration, and reduction were used. The results showed that the phenomenon of learning to <b>read,</b> <b>write</b> and count in early childhood in Pekalongan appeared on concerns of parents with a basic level of selection into the elementary school. Many early childhood activities were included in the part-time formal learning. Most of them also followed that lesson in educational institutions. Consequently, those who were following the course outside their formal school mastered faster, although their psychological impact tended to quickly become bored with learning. Meanwhile, the introduction of learning to <b>read,</b> <b>write</b> and count in early childhood in kindergarten was slower because it did not focus solely on that learning, but dominantly in play activities. On the one hand, the kids did not get bored and did not realize they were learning to <b>read,</b> <b>write</b> and count, because learning is integrated in play activities...|$|R
