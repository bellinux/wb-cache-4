5|$|Even though alpha {{radiation}} cannot penetrate the skin, ingested or inhaled plutonium does irradiate internal organs. Alpha particles generated by inhaled plutonium {{have been found}} to cause lung cancer in a cohort of European nuclear workers. The skeleton, where plutonium accumulates, and the liver, where it collects and becomes concentrated, are at risk. Plutonium is not absorbed into the body efficiently when ingested; only 0.04% of plutonium oxide is absorbed after ingestion. Plutonium absorbed by the body is excreted very slowly, with a biological half-life of 200 years. Plutonium passes only <b>slowly</b> <b>through</b> cell membranes and intestinal boundaries, so absorption by ingestion and incorporation into bone structure proceeds very slowly.|$|E

5|$|Hurdt {{wanted to}} attack Trunajaya's stronghold Kediri from Surabaya in coastal East Java, {{which would be}} the {{shortest}} route. However, Amangkurat II proposed that the troops be divided into columns and march along a lengthy overland route. He wanted the VOC-Mataram forces to march <b>slowly</b> <b>through</b> more areas in order to impress factions that were wavering over which side to take. This argument convinced Hurdt, and they decided to split the army into three different columns travelling via different overland routes from coastal Central Java to Kediri in inland East Java. In addition, a VOC merchant, Willem Bastinck, was to go to Surabaya to seek out Karaeng Galesonga former Trunajaya ally, whose allegiance was wavering, and whose help Mataram and the VOC hoped to enlistand his followers.|$|E
5|$|One major {{distinguishing}} feature between all loris species is locomotion: the Sunda slow loris moves <b>slowly</b> <b>through</b> trees {{on all four}} limbs, typically with three limbs attached to a support at a time. Its movement {{has been described as}} unique; similar to crawling, or as if it was climbing in every direction, the Sunda slow loris changes direction or moves between branches with little noise or change in speed. In captivity, about a quarter of its time is spent moving quadrupedally, a quarter suspended or hanging, a quarter climbing, and a quarter clasping multiple branches (bridging). It may hang below a branch by one or both feet for long periods of time.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Gilda in 1973 was {{the first}} {{documented}} tropical cyclone on record to transition into a subtropical cyclone. It formed on October16 in the western Caribbean Sea from a tropical wave, and strengthened to reach peak winds of 70mph (110km/h) before striking Cuba. It later moved <b>slowly</b> <b>through</b> the Bahamas before weakening to tropical depression status. On October24, {{with the assistance of}} a cold front off the coast of the eastern United States, Gilda transformed into a subtropical storm, becoming very large and strong. The storm later accelerated northeastward and became extratropical, ultimately dissipating near Greenland.|$|E
5|$|A dissipating {{cold front}} stalled across the {{northeast}}ern Atlantic Ocean on September7, {{northeast of the}} Azores. That day, a closed circulation developed and quickly became independent of the front. Based on a uniform thermal structure, as well as ship reports {{in the region of}} gale-force winds near the center, it is estimated that the system became a tropical storm early on September8. That day, the system moved west-southwestward, atypical for cyclones in that region during September. On September9, the storm turned to the southeast, reaching estimated peak winds of 50mph (85km/h), based on ship observations. Moving <b>slowly</b> <b>through</b> the northern Azores, the storm produced winds of 35mph (55km/h) along Terceira Island. It slowly weakened, and by late on September10 the system degraded into a tropical depression. By the next day, the system was interacting with an approaching cold front, indicating that the depression had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Around 20:00UTC, the storm moved ashore the southwestern tip of Portugal with gale-force winds. The storm turned to the northwest through the Iberian Peninsula, dissipating on September14 over southwestern France.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance moved northward, crossing Guatemala {{from the eastern}} Pacific ocean into the northwest Caribbean Sea between September 20 and September 21. It became a tropical cyclone soon after emerging into the Caribbean, and moved across the Yucatán Peninsula as a tropical depression before becoming a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico on September 22 and a hurricane on September 23. It turned sharply east-northeast across the Mouth of the Mississippi river on September 24 as a minor hurricane. The storm continued east-northeast and made landfall in Florida east of Pensacola. The system evolved into an extratropical cyclone soon after passing out of the Sunshine State and continued moving east to northeast hugging the Atlantic Seaboard to near the Virginia Capes before moving <b>slowly</b> <b>through</b> the shipping lanes between Canada and Bermuda, blocked by a high pressure system in southeast Canada.|$|E

5|$|After passing <b>slowly</b> <b>through</b> Vanuatu, Ivy began {{accelerating}} to {{the southeast}} and its eye passed {{very close to the}} capital city of Port Vila, after moving over the island of Epi. As the cyclone moved away from the island group, it underwent an eyewall replacement cycle. In addition, the combination of cooler water temperatures, greater wind shear, less outflow, and land interaction with Vanuatu caused gradual weakening. Late on February 27, Ivy entered the area of warning responsibility of the Wellington Regional Specialized Meteorological Center. The convection rapidly diminished and left the circulation exposed, and Ivy transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on February 28. It remained strong and maintained a well-defined circulation as it passed just east of East Cape, New Zealand. Continuing southeastward, the extratropical remnants crossed the International Dateline on February 29, and Ivy dissipated about 1800km (1100mi) southeast of New Zealand on March 2.|$|E
5|$|Eruptions on Mauna Loa {{are almost}} always preceded and {{accompanied}} by prolonged episodes of seismic activity, the monitoring {{of which was the}} primary and often only warning mechanism in the past and which remains viable today. Seismic stations have been maintained on Hawaiʻi since the Observatory's inception, but these were concentrated primarily on Kīlauea, with coverage on Mauna Loa improving only <b>slowly</b> <b>through</b> the 20th century. Following the invention of modern monitoring equipment, the backbone of the present-day monitoring system was installed on the volcano in the 1970s. Mauna Loa's July 1975 eruption was forewarned by {{more than a year of}} seismic unrest, with the HVO issuing warnings to the general public from late 1974; the 1984 eruption was similarly preceded by as much as three years of unusually high seismic activity, with volcanologists predicting an eruption within two years in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Just beyond East Norwood, the Pennsylvania built McCullough Yard in 1927, {{improving}} switching {{operations for}} the growing industrial base in Norwood. A connection was included to the Pennsylvania's Chicago-bound Richmond Branch, which the CL crossed over north of the yard. In Butler County, north of Brecon, the CL curved abruptly northeast onto the original line, partially graded in the 1850s between Sharonville and Lebanon. Just beyond, it began to descend <b>slowly</b> <b>through</b> Mason to Hageman, where it crossed the Middletown Branch, and then rose slightly, alongside Turtle Creek, to Lebanon. The Pennsylvania tore down the original Lebanon passenger station in 1960, replacing it (for freight purposes) with a smaller building from Kings Mills on the Little Miami Railroad. The Lebanon Council of Garden Clubs acquired the land in 1972, tore down the freight depot, and erected {{a replica of the}} old passenger depot in its place, with a gift shop inside.|$|E

5|$|The Duke's train had {{run more}} <b>slowly</b> <b>through</b> {{populated}} areas {{owing to the}} cheering crowds, {{and by the time}} it reached Parkside the first two trains on the northern track, Phoenix and North Star, had already passed through Parkside and had pulled up ahead of the station waiting for the Duke's train to depart. By now, the passengers in the Duke's train had been travelling for almost an hour, and the water stop at Parkside was the only scheduled stop on the journey. Although it was beginning to drizzle, and despite a request from the railway engineers for passengers to remain on the trains, at 11.55am around 50 men disembarked from the Duke's train to stretch their legs. The group consisted of many of the most influential figures of the day, including the Marquess of Stafford, Charles Arbuthnot, Prince Esterházy, the Earl of Wilton, L founder Joseph Sandars and William Huskisson. As the rain had formed deep puddles {{on either side of the}} railway embankment, most of the party remained on or near the railway tracks.|$|E
5|$|Ernest {{resumed his}} duties in early November, by now {{promoted}} to major-general. He hoped his new rank {{would bring him}} a corps or brigade command, but none was forthcoming as the Allied armies retreated <b>slowly</b> <b>through</b> the Netherlands towards Germany. By February 1795, they had reached Hanover. Ernest remained in Hanover over the next year, holding several unimportant postings. He had requested a return home to seek treatment for his eye, {{but it was not}} until early 1796 that the King agreed and allowed Ernest to return to Britain. There, Prince Ernest consulted a notable eye doctor, Wathen Waller, but Waller apparently found his condition inoperable, as no operation took place. Once back in Britain, Ernest repeatedly sought to be allowed to join the British forces on the Continent, even threatening to join the Yeomanry as a private, but both the King and the Duke of York refused. Ernest did not want to rejoin the Hanoverian forces, as they were not then involved in the fighting. In addition, Freytag was seriously ill, and Ernest was unwilling to serve under his likely successor, Count von Wallmoden.|$|E
5|$|The Test started amid {{controversy}} {{following the}} omission of leading England batsman Len Hutton for performing poorly in the previous match. Having largely failedapart from brief periodsto challenge Australia {{in the first two}} Tests, the hosts had made four changes to their team in an attempt to find a combination that could threaten the visitors' supremacy. Australia made their first change for the series, ending the Test career of veteran batsman Bill Brown after two poor matches. England captain Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat, but his team were quickly in trouble, with Denis Compton forced from the field after being bloodied in the head by a Ray Lindwall bouncer. At this stage, the hosts were at 33/2 with an injured player, and they batted defensively for a period to try and regroup. Having received treatment, Compton returned with England in difficulty at 119/5 midway through the day and proceeded to score 145 not out, aided by several dropped catches, helping England to recover to 363 all out on the second afternoon. England could have been in an even stronger position, but Compton and seamer Alec Bedser were involved in a mix-up, resulting in the latter being run out and ending a 121-run partnership. Lindwall was the most successful bowler, taking 4/99. During the England innings, Australian opener Sid Barnes, who had gained much attention throughout the season for fielding at point-blank range in front of the batsman on strike, was hit in the ribs by a Dick Pollard pull shot and had to be carried from the ground and hospitalised. In reply, Australia batted steadily to be 126/3 {{by the end of the}} second day, but then fell to be 172/6—effectively seven wickets down with Barnes unable to bat after collapsing again—before evading the follow on by reaching 221. Australia scored <b>slowly</b> <b>through</b> the innings, finding the hosts' bowlers difficult to negotiate; Bedser took 4/81 and Pollard 3/53.|$|E
