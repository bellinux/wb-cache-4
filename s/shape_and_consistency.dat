5000|$|In Navajo (Southern Athabaskan) nouns are {{classified}} {{according to their}} animacy, <b>shape,</b> <b>and</b> <b>consistency.</b> Morphologically, however, the distinctions are not expressed on the nouns themselves, but on the verbs of which the nouns are the subject or direct object. For example, in the sentence [...] "My shirt is lying on the bed", the verb [...] "lies" [...] is used because the subject [...] "my shirt" [...] is a flat, flexible object. In the sentence [...] "My belt is lying on the bed", the verb [...] "lies" [...] is used because the subject [...] "my belt" [...] is a slender, flexible object.|$|E

Three specimens were wrapped with Plaster of Paris (POP) and the other three with commercially available silicone interface liner. Data was obtained by utilising MRI technology and then the segmented images compared to corresponding calliper measurement, photographic imaging, and water suspension techniques. The MRI measurement results were strongly correlated with actual diameter, surface area, and volume measurements.

Alternatively, a microstirrer consisting of a birefringent particle trapped in an elliptically polarized laser trap was used to induce motion and tumbling of a selected chloroplast suspended in a solution. We demonstrate that displacement of chloroplasts inside the cell is extremely difficult, presumably due to chloroplast adhesion to the cytoskeleton and connections between organelles.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{developed}} for generating pseudopotentials {{for use in}} correlated-electron calculations.

The resulting energy consistent correlated electron pseudopotentials (eCEPPs) are constructed for H, Li [...] F, Sc [...] Fe, and Cu. Their accuracy is quantified by comparing the relaxed molecular geometries and dissociation energies they provide with all electron results, with all quantities evaluated using coupled cluster singles doubles and triples calculations. Errors inherent in the pseudopotentials are also compared with those arising from a number of approximations commonly used with pseudopotentials. The eCEPPs provide a significant improvement in optimised geometries and dissociation energies for small molecules, with errors for the latter being an order-of-magnitude smaller than for Hartree-Fock-based pseudopotentials available in the literature. Gaussian basis sets are optimised for use with these pseudopotentials. Comment: 18 pages, 5 figures. Includes supplemental informatio...|$|R

40|$|The pathogenetic {{mechanism}} of hearing loss {{in patients with}} vestibular schwannomas (VS) remains unclear. Our aim {{was to determine the}} radiological and clinical parameters that might be related to hearing. The radiological images and charts of 99 patients were reviewed. Image processing software was used to analyse the maximal tumor diameter in three planes; its volume; its extension cranially, caudally, anteriorly and posteriorly; the width and length of the intrameatal tumor portion, its shape and consistency; and the tumor-fundus distance. These parameters were correlated with the patient's pre-operative hearing range. The degree of hearing correlated significantly with the tumor size, volume and coronal diameter, the degree of intrameatal tumor growth, and the distance between the lateral tumor end and the fundus (p < 0. 05). No correlation was found regarding tumor extension, <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> <b>consistency,</b> the presence of hydrocephalus, or the extent of erosion of the internal auditory canal. Loss of hearing in the VS appears to be multifactorial. Determining the radiological parameters related to the hearing level can help to clarify the pathophysiological mechanisms involved...|$|E
40|$|Synopsis Gymnosomatous pteropods {{are highly}} {{specialized}} planktonic predators that feed exclusively on their thecosomatous relatives. Feeding {{behavior and the}} morphology of gymnosome feeding structures are diverse and have evolved {{in concert with the}} size, <b>shape,</b> <b>and</b> <b>consistency</b> of the thecosome shell. Here, we show that the metabolic capacity and locomotory behaviors of gymnosomes are similarly diverse and vary with those of their prey. Both gymnosomes and thecosomes range from gelatinous sit-and-wait forms to active predators with high-performance locomotory muscles. We find more than 10 -fold variation in size-adjusted and temperature-adjusted metabolic rates within both the Gymnosomata and Thecosomata and a strong correlation between the metabolic rates of predators and of prey. Furthermore, these characteristics are strongly influenced by environmental parameters and predator and prey converge upon similar physiological capacities under similar selection. For example, compensation of locomotory capacity in cold waters leads to elevated metabolic rates in polar species. This highly coevolved system is discussed in terms of a predator– prey ‘‘arms race’ ’ and the impending loss of both predator and prey as elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide levels threaten to dissolve prey shells via oceanic acidification...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} pairwise 3 D alignment which solves data association by matching scan segments across scans. Generating accurate segment associa-tions allows to run {{a modified version of}} the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm where the search for point-to-point correspondences is constrained to associated segments. The novelty of the proposed approach is in the segment matching process which takes into account the proximity of segments, their <b>shape,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>consistency</b> of their relative locations in each scan. Scan segmentation is here assumed to be given (recent studies provide various alternatives [10], [19]). The method is tested on seven sequences of Velodyne scans acquired in urban environments. Unlike various other standard versions of ICP, which fail to recover correct alignment when the displacement between scans increases, the proposed method is shown to be robust to displacements of several meters. In addition, it is shown to lead to savings in computational times which are potentially critical in real-time applications. I...|$|R

In a manual operation method the air-gun sprayer is held by a skilled operator, about 6 to(-) 10 in from the object, and moved back and forth over the surface, each stroke overlapping the previous to ensure a continuous coat. In an automatic process the gun head is attached to a mounting block and delivers the stream of paint from that position. The object being painted is usually placed on rollers or a turntable to ensure overall equal coverage of all sides.|$|R
40|$|AbstractModified {{activated}} carbon cloth is prepared by mechanochemical modification {{of viscose rayon}} carbon cloth. The effects of different milling atmospheres, {{in the air and}} inert conditions, were investigated. Changes in kind and number of acidic and basic surface groups on the surface of {{activated carbon}} cloth, upon modification, as well as before and after the sorption of arsenic were determined. Higher number of basic groups responsible for the removal of arsenic ions was achieved by modification under inert conditions. Breakage and collapse of cylindrical fibers, decrease of particle sizes, change in the <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> <b>consistency</b> of the particles, as well as increase of microstructural disorder i. e. the loss of turbostratic structure occurred upon milling. pHPZC values increased from 4. 46 to 5. 04 and 5. 77 after the air and inert milling, respectively. Adsorption followed pseudo second order kinetics with chemisorption as rate-controlling step. Langmuir isotherm best fit the equilibrium data and maximum adsorption capacity is 5. 5 mgg− 1 at a pH value close to 7. 0, typical for groundwater.

40|$|A {{study of}} 645 normal adult {{parathyroid}} glands in 160 cadavers revealed {{that there is}} a definite pattern of anatomic distribution {{on the basis of the}} embryologic development of the parathyroid, thyroid, and thymic glands. The sites of predilection of the upper gland (Parathyroid IV) are, in order of frequency, the cricothyroid junction; the dorsum of the upper pole of the thyroid; and the retropharyngeal space. Those of the lower gland (Parathyroid III) are at the lower pole of the thyroid and the thymic tongue; rarely in the upper, the lateral neck, or the mediastinum. An understanding of the developmental relationship of the parathyroid glands to the thyroid and the thymus is fundamental in the delineation of the embryologic origin of the parathyroid glands. The parathyroid gland, located within the surgical capsule of the thyroid (subcapsular), when diseased, remains in place locally. A gland outside of the capsule (extracapsular) is often displaced into the posterior or anterior mediastinum. A collective assessment of the size, weight, color, <b>shape,</b> <b>and</b> <b>consistency</b> of the parathyroid gland is mandatory in the determination of its normalcy. Frozen section examination for stromal and intracellular fatty content is an added assurance of normalcy.

The objective may be {{defined in terms of}} the following points: (1) communication between designers and users; (2) differences in appraisal between groups of experts and nonexperts; (3) systematic relationships between structural characteristics and expressive qualities of the objects considered. Three groups of subjects were interviewed: four designers responsible for the design of six objects, twenty advanced-level design students (experts), and twenty nonexpert students.
