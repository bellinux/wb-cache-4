The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the general level of dormancy in 375 wheat genotypes and influence of seed colour on that level. Sprouting is in negative correlation with the level of dormancy. Germination tests were carried out during three periods (at harvest, 45 and 90 days after the harvest) Seed colour of all genotypes was determined visually. It is determined significant correlation between the number of <b>sprouted</b> <b>grains</b> at the harvest and 45 days after the harvest and between the number of <b>sprouted</b> <b>grains</b> 45 days after the harvest and 90 days after the harvest. Significant, negative correlation was determined between the number of <b>sprouted</b> <b>grains</b> at the harvest and seed colour (Tab. 3). At the harvest, 52. 3 % genotypes were very dormant. Very high percent of sprouting had 8. 8 % genotypes. Forty five days after the harvest, only five genotypes were dormant. At the third sampling time all genotypes were non dormant.

50|$|Fodder in {{the form}} of <b>sprouted</b> <b>grains</b> and legumes can be grown in small and large quantities. Systems have been {{developed}} recently that allow for many tons of sprouts to be produced each day, year round. <b>Sprouted</b> <b>grains</b> can greatly increase the nutritional value of the grain compared with feeding the ungerminated grain to stock. In addition, they use less water than traditional forage, making them ideal for drought conditions. Sprouted barley and other cereal grains can be grown hydroponically in a carefully controlled environment. Under hydroponic conditions, sprouted fodder at 150 mm tall with a 50 mm root mat is at its peak for animal feed. Although products such are barley are <b>grain,</b> when <b>sprouted</b> they are approved by the American Grassfed Association to be used as livestock feed.|$|R

50|$|Sprouting or pre-harvest {{germination}} {{is caused}} by damp or rainy weather conditions during {{the final stage of}} maturation of the crop. The germination causes an accelerated production of the starch degrading enzyme alpha-amylase. Severely <b>sprouted</b> <b>grain</b> kernels can contain several thousand times the amount of enzyme of sound unsprouted kernels. Because of this, very low levels of severely sprouted kernels mixed into sound wheat can cause the entire lot to exhibit significant amylase activity. Since its introduction in the early 1960s, the FN test has become a world standard in the grain and flour milling industries for measuring alpha-amylase activity in wheat, durum wheat, triticale, rye and barley, as well as milled products made from these grains.|$|E

50|$|Once the starch is {{converted}} to sugar it can be readily fermented by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, first the sprouting process should be stopped.

50|$|After 60 {{seconds of}} mixing, the stirrer is {{dropped from the}} top of the test tube, and the {{operator}} measures the time it takes for the stirrer to reach the bottom. That time, measured in seconds, is the Falling Number. When the stirrer is dropped, its speed and thus the time it takes it to fall to the bottom, will be determined by the viscosity of the slurry. In other words, the more sprouted the grain was the higher the alpha-amylase activity will be. The higher the alpha-amylase activity the lower the viscosity of the slurry. The lower the viscosity of the slurry the faster the stirrer will fall to the bottom.

Out of more than two hundred ceramic pots discovered at the sites, seven were specifically used for grape wine. Remnants of grape seeds were also discovered. If grape wine consumption was once present in Bronze Age China, however, it was replaced by consumption of a range of alcoholic beverages made from sorghum, millet, rice, and fruits such as lychee or Asian plum.In the 130s and 120s BC, a Chinese imperial envoy of the Han dynasty (206 BC - 220 AD) named Zhang Qian opened diplomatic relations with several Central Asian kingdoms, some of which produced grape wine. By {{the end of the second}} century BC, Han envoys had brought grape seeds from the wine-loving kingdom of Dayuan (Ferghana in modern Uzbekistan) back to China and had them planted on imperial lands near the capital Chang'an (near modern-day Xi'an in Shaanxi province). The Shennong Bencao Jing, a work on materia medica compiled in the late Han, states that grapes could be used to produce wine. In the Three Kingdoms era (220-280 AD), Wei emperor Cao Pi noted that grape wine [...] "is sweeter than the wine made cereals using ferments and <b>sprouted</b> <b>grain.</b> One recovers from it more easily when one has taken too much."

40|$|The {{promising}} {{direction of}} innovative technologies in bakery is {{the production of}} bread {{with the use of}} wheat germ (Triticumaestivum L.), in which all the nutrients incorporated into the grain by nature are rationally used.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryRebecca A. ReganA laboratory-scale {{method for}} wheat {{germination}} {{was developed and}} used to compare hard red winter wheat varieties for sprout related attributes, activity, and whole wheat bread baking performance. WB 4458, WB Grainfield, LCS Mint, LCS Wizard, SY Monument, and T 158 wheat varieties grown in three Kansas locations were germinated with the developed small-scale germination method and falling number values were compared. Byrd, Tam 204, and T 158 were germinated with a scaled-up germination method aimed at generating samples in three falling number ranges of less than 120 seconds (low falling number and highly sprouted), 250 ± 40 seconds (medium falling number), and 350 ± 40 seconds (high falling number and low sprouting). Controls were un-germinated, sound (> 400 seconds falling number), samples of each variety. The control whole grain and sprouted wheat was ground into flour. A mixograph {{was used to determine}} dough water absorption and mixing time. Whole wheat bread was made to determine bread volume, crumb characteristics, and bread texture. Overall there were few significant differences within each wheat variety for the different levels of germination. The only significant difference observed in all three varieties was that each highly <b>sprouted</b> <b>grain</b> (< 120 seconds falling number) produced bread with significantly lower elasticity than the control within each variety, indicating that this level of germination produced a gummier bread. Elasticity was positively correlated with falling number (r=+ 0. 71). A focused analysis on the Byrd variety compared the germinated samples to samples generated with added malted barley to the same falling number ranges. RVA analysis showed the gelatinization profiles for germinated and malted samples were similar within each falling number range. The highly and medium <b>sprouted</b> <b>grain</b> had significantly lower dough water absorption than the malted counterparts for those levels and the medium <b>sprouted</b> <b>grain</b> also had a lower mix time then the malted sample. There {{were no significant differences in}} bread volume, crumb characteristics, or bread texture except the highly <b>sprouted</b> <b>grain</b> had significantly lower elasticity than the control and the malted counterpart was not significantly different.

40|$|Abstract: Six grain samples namely barley, maize, millet, rice, sorghum {{and wheat}} were tested for enzyme levels (amylase, {{protease}} and lipase) {{in order to}} assess their malting characteristics, using barley as a standard. The levels of the enzymes were estimated in the whole dry grains, 24 h steeped, 24 h sprouted and 48 h <b>sprouted</b> <b>grains.</b> A combined statistical analysis of linear regression and analysis of variance were used to test for enzyme interaction, similarities and interspecific relationship between the cereals. The estimated interspecific relationship between sorghum and barley was 84 % based on the three enzymes, while millet had 75 %. All the sprouted cereals {{with the exception of the}} standard barley had high lipase levels. This possibly suggests certain limitations as regards to production of off-flavours. Malt prepared from maize, sorghum, rice and millet had comparable protease levels with barley (P> 0. 05). The malts prepared from maize, millet, rice, sorghum and wheat had comparatively low alpha-amylase levels when compared with the standard barley.
