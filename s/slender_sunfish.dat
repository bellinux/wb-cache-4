50|$|This {{jellyfish}} {{is often}} seen in swarms. The tentacles have a painful sting, although the sting is not known to be fatal. It is eaten by the sunfishes, Mola mola and Mola ramsayi, {{as well as the}} <b>slender</b> <b>sunfish,</b> Ranzania laevis.|$|E
50|$|The <b>slender</b> <b>sunfish</b> (Ranzania laevis) is a mola of {{the family}} Molidae, {{the only member of}} the genus Ranzania, found {{globally}} in tropical and temperate seas. Its length is up to 1 m (3.3 ft). Several stranding and mass stranding events have been discovered on beaches near Albany, Western Australia.|$|E

40|$|<b>Slender</b> <b>sunfish,</b> Ranzania laevis {{measuring}} a {{total length}} of 52. 5 cm and weighing 3. 8 kg was caught from {{a depth of}} 40 m in the multiday dol net operated 156 km away from the Pachu Bandar Vasai Fort, Mumbai coast, Maharashtra. Detailed Morphmetric measurements, meristic counts and biology of fish were presented in the paper. This species was caught after 48 years off Mumbai, North-West Coast of India...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to crustaceans, remains from 17 individual squid {{were found in}} the stomach of a 58 cm <b>slender</b> <b>sunfish</b> Ranzania laevis from Australia, adding a new prey item to their little studied diet. Taken together with existing data from the literature, crustaceans appear to be a common prey item, with larger R. laevis (26 – 65 cm) also taking small fish and squid. Along with new documentation on breaching, the unexpected finding of squid in the stomach confirms that these fish are fast and agile predators. Postprin...|$|E
40|$|The Collective Article ‘New Mediterranean Biodiversity Records’ of the Mediterranean Marine Science journal {{offers the}} means to publish {{biodiversity}} records in the Mediterranean Sea. The current article is divided in two parts, for records of native and alien species respectively. The new records of native fish species include: the <b>slender</b> <b>sunfish</b> Ranzania laevis and the scalloped ribbonfish Zu cristatus in Calabria; the Azores rockling Gaidropsarus granti in Calabria and Sicily; the agujon needlefish Tylosu¬rus acus imperialis in the Northern Aegean; and the amphibious behaviour of Gouania willdenowi in Southern Turkey. As regards molluscs, the interesting findings include Ischnochiton usticensis in Calabria and Thordisa filix in the bay of Piran (Slovenia). The stomatopod Parasquilla ferussaci was collected from Lesvos island (Greece); the isopod Anilocra frontalis was observed parasit¬izing the alien Pteragogus trispilus in the Rhodes area. The asteroid Tethyaster subinermis and the butterfly ray Gymnura altavela were reported from several localities in the Greek Ionian and Aegean Seas. The new records of alien species include: the antenna codlet Bregmaceros atlanticus in Saronikos Gulf; three new fish records and two decapods from Egypt; {{the establishment of the}} two spot cardinal fish Cheilodipterus novemstriatus and the first record of the marble shrimp Saron marmoratus in semi-dark caves along the Lebanese coastline; the finding of Lagocephalus sceleratus, Sargocentron rubrum, Fistularia commersonii and Stephanolepis diaspros around Lipsi island (Aegean Sea, Greece); the decapod Penaeus Hathor in Aegean waters; the decapod Penaeus aztecus and the nudibranch Melibe viridis in the Dodecanese islands; the finding of Pinctada imbricata radiate in the Mar Grande of Taranto (Ionian Sea, Italy) and the Maliakos Gulf (Greece) ...|$|E
