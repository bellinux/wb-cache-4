Only one edition altered Milton's views: a version possibly edited by James Tyrell, a historian, was changed during a controversy over the succession of William III. The work was retitled Pro Populo Adversus Tyrannos: Or the <b>Sovereign</b> <b>Right</b> and Power of the People over Tyrants. This work continued to be advertised, in 1691, as being Milton's work.|$|E

25|$|According to Chief Smith, the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 overrode the 1970 Principal Chiefs Act, and the Cherokee Nation had the <b>sovereign</b> <b>right</b> to {{determine}} its citizenship requirements. Smith stated that the Cherokee Nation Supreme Court ruled that the Cherokee Nation could take away the approval authority it had granted {{the federal government and}} that the Nation will abide by the court's decision. Despite the ruling, the issue of amending the process of federal approval was placed on the ballot for the June 23, 2007 general election. Cherokee voters approved the amendment to remove federal oversight by a 2–1 margin, but the BIA still has to approve. Jeanette Hanna, director of the BIA's Eastern Oklahoma Regional Office, said that the regional office has recommended approval of the vote on removal of Secretarial oversight.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Alexander Downer, the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, {{announced}} that the Australian Government would be requesting permission from Indonesia to test the cannabis and help determine its point of origin. It was argued that testing of the cannabis would have strengthened Corby's defence if {{it could have been}} shown that the drugs were grown in Indonesia, or potentially weakened it if they were grown in southern Queensland or elsewhere in Australia. However, shortly thereafter the Australian Consul General in Indonesia informed Corby that the AFP had no jurisdiction in the case, and in early 2005 the AFP was advised that the Bali police would not be providing a sample. Downer acknowledged that Indonesia had denied the request, but clarified that as the case was in Indonesia, it was their <b>sovereign</b> <b>right</b> to do so.|$|E
25|$|A special {{election}} {{was scheduled for}} September 24, 2011. On August 21, 2011, prior to the scheduling of the Cherokee {{special election}}, the Cherokee Nation Supreme Court reversed the January 14 decision of the Cherokee District Court, resulting in the disenrollment of the Freedmen descendants. Justice Darell Matlock Jr. ruled that the Cherokee people had the <b>sovereign</b> <b>right</b> to amend the Cherokee Nation constitution and to set citizenship requirements. The decision was 4 to 1 with Justice Darrell Dowty dissenting. Many observers questioned {{the timing of the}} decision as the Cherokee Freedmen voters, who voted in the June general election, were disenfranchised going into the special election. The decision also removed the injunction of the District Court which had kept the Freedmen descendants in the Nation. On September 11, 2011, the Cherokee Nation sent letters to 2800 Freedmen descendants informing them of their disenrollment. In response, Jon Velie and the Freedmen descendants filed another motion for preliminary injunction in federal district court asking to reinstate their rights for the election.|$|E

2500|$|Some Cherokee {{who oppose}} {{membership}} for Freedmen descendants support Chief Smith's position: that the Freedmen are not Cherokee citizens because their ancestors were {{listed on the}} Freedmen Roll of the Dawes Rolls {{and not on the}} [...] "Cherokee By-Blood" [...] Roll (although some were in fact of Cherokee blood). Smith and supporters claim that the Freedmen and their descendants have not been active in the tribe for 100 years, the Freedmen were compensated for slavery by their Dawes land allotments and not tribal membership, and they were forced on the tribe by the US under the Treaty of 1866. Some Cherokee believe the Freedmen descendants only want to share in the tribe's new resources and Cherokee Nation's federally funded programs. Other Cherokee argue the case on the basis of tribal sovereignty, saying that Cherokee Nation members have the <b>sovereign</b> <b>right</b> to determine qualifications for membership.
