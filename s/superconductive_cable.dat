40|$|The paper {{represents}} an introductory study about a <b>superconductive</b> <b>cable</b> levitating in Earth’s magnetic field. Built are two mathematical {{models of the}} problem providing both {{the shape of the}} arc of the cable and forces acting along it. The theoretical analysis is supplemented with an illustrative example...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} obtain the {{required}} magnetic &# 64257;eld quality in the LHC main dipole, the <b>superconductive</b> <b>cables</b> blocks are separated by copper wedges. These components must respect geometrical tolerances of ± 30 micrometers. Non-nominal copper wedge dimensions change the position of cables blocks and therefore affect field quality. In this paper we present the measurements of the copper wedges used in the main LHC dipoles. We then evaluate the influence of copper wedge dimensions on field quality, comparing it to the warm magnetic measurements of the collared coils. Finally, in order to foresee {{the impact of the}} copper wedge production on the random and on the systematic parts of the field harmonics we implement a Monte-Carlo method. Comparison with targets imposed by beam dynamics is used to judge how critical the tolerances on copper wedges are...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} of quenching in low temperature superconducting wires {{is of great}} relevance for a proper design of <b>superconductive</b> <b>cables</b> and magnets. This paper reports the experimental results of a vast measurement campaign of quench induced by laser pulses on NbTi and Nb 3 Sn wires in pool boiling Helium I. A comparison of the quench behavior of two typical NbTi and Nb 3 Sn wires is shown from different standpoints. Different qualitative behaviors of the voltage traces recorded during quenches and recoveries on NbTi and Nb 3 Sn wires are reported and analyzed. It is shown that the Nb 3 Sn wire exhibits a quench or no-quench behavior, whereas quenches and recoveries are exhibited by the NbTi wire. The two wires are also compared considering the behaviors of the two main parameters describing quench, i. e. quench energies and quench velocities, with respect to operation current and pulse duration and magnetic field. It is shown that the Nb 3 Sn wire exhibits a ‘kink’ of the quench energy vs current curve that makes the quench energy of Nb 3 Sn {{lower than that of}} NbTi at some intermediate current levels. Both the qualitative differences of the voltage traces and the different behaviors of quench energies and velocities are interpreted through a coupled electromagnetic- thermal model, with special emphasis on the detailed description of heat exchange with liquid helium...|$|R
