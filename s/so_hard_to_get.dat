As this emotional instability continued and worsened with the abrupt ending of another relationship, {{the character}} was seen to develop full blown alcoholism. Series producer Diana Kyle said of the storyline: [...] "It's important we cover topics that are relevant today. Every day, people in the medical profession deal with patients who have drink or drug problems.

[...] Speaking of Kyla's struggle to deal with her addiction, she added: [...] "She'll work <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> her life together.

2500|$|The HBC and Robert Cunningham came to {{a mutual}} {{decision}} that the rivalry was not profitable and an agreement was reached to end it. Cunningham tied up his vessel, and the HBC hauled his freight for free. Later, the HBC bought the Hazelton.

The Northwest's main purpose was to deliver liquor from the coast to hotels along the Skeena.|$|E

30|$|In fact, the {{contemporary}} goal of most transport policy plans to shift {{people out of}} their cars into walking, cycling and public transport still applies. But the potential for this shift is much larger with the AV. Even if the focus is currently on the autonomous car, the autonomous public transport [101] offers much more potential and AVs could prove to be the key success factor for a transport system that relies on public transport. Gains can even be extended if such autonomous public transport is integrated with higher levels of walking and cycling especially for the last mile travel [86]. The AV technology in a way does not make a big difference for transport policy, {{but at the same time}} it can make it much easier or <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> achieve the transport policy goals we set. Since the AV is imminent, the choice will have to be made and the sooner we make an informed and realistic decision on the role of the AV in the future mobility and transport system, the better.

They have none of our ambivalence—independence vs. love, distinction vs. belonging. Their struggle is with the world—will it let them lose their loneliness? And how?

6000|$|Three months later, {{near the}} same spot, on Mere Down, I found these birds feasting on the corn, {{when it had}} been long cut but could not be carried {{on account of the}} wet weather.

Never had I witnessed birds so manifestly rejoicing at their good fortune, with happy, loud caw-caw. Or rather haw-haw! what a harvest, what abundance! was there ever a more perfect August and September! Rain, rain, by night and in the morning; then sun and wind to dry our feathers and make us glad, but never enough to dry the corn to enable them to carry it and build it up in stacks where it would be <b>so</b> much <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> at.
