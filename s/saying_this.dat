5|$|At Wonderfontein on 15 December 1879, 6,000 burghers, {{many of them}} {{bearing the}} republic's vierkleur ("four-colour") flag, voted to pursue a restored, {{independent}} republic. Pretorius and Bok were imprisoned on charges of high treason when they took this news to Wolseley and Sir Owen Lanyon (who had replaced Shepstone), prompting many burghers to consider rising up there and then—Kruger persuaded them not to, <b>saying</b> <b>this</b> was premature. Pretorius and Bok were swiftly released after Jorissen telegraphed the British Liberal politician William Ewart Gladstone, who had met Kruger's first deputation in London and had since condemned the annexation as unjust during his Midlothian campaign.|$|E
5|$|By <b>saying</b> <b>this,</b> Kennedy was admonishing {{people not}} to riot in wake of King's death and in effect equating their actions {{to that of the}} civil rights leader's assassin. After quoting Abraham Lincoln, he portrayed the American public as a people {{increasingly}} succumbing to its violent tendencies that undermined its national ideals. He argued that all deaths degraded American society, thereby assuming an uncompromising stance that any and all acts of violence were unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|On August 8, 2009, a {{photograph}} was taken at a DPJ rally for the House of Representatives election showing a banner that was {{hanging from a}} ceiling. The banner was made of two Hinomaru flags cut and sewn together to form {{the shape of the}} DPJ logo. This infuriated the LDP and Prime Minister Tarō Asō, <b>saying</b> <b>this</b> act was unforgivable. In response, DPJ President Yukio Hatoyama (who voted for the Law Regarding the National Flag and National Anthem) said that the banner was not the Hinomaru and should not be regarded as such.|$|E

5|$|The pay dispute {{split the}} unit. About two thirds went on strike, {{saying they would}} not return to action unless the Army upped their wages and paid them in foreign currency. Meanwhile, {{some of the more}} {{contented}} Frenchmen made steps to remain permanently, buying cars and having their wives join them in Salisbury. The Army detained the strike's ringleaders for insubordination. With neither side willing to budge—the Army refused to give the strikers extra pay or special treatment, <b>saying</b> <b>this</b> would contravene Rhodesia's policy not to engage mercenaries—the disaffected men were repatriated to France at their own request. The Rhodesian Army considered disbanding the unit altogether, but persevered when Major de l'Assomption convinced his superiors that his remaining men were still loyal and eager to continue serving.|$|E
5|$|After Ashtar escapes {{into the}} Maze of Darkness, Robert tells Ryu about Ashtar's plot {{to take over}} the world by using the full power of his sword, the Dark Sword of Chaos. Robert implores Ryu to stop Ashtar before his Dark Sword reaches full power. After battling through the Maze of Darkness and into the World of Chaos, Ryu hears echoes of Ashtar's plan in the distance. Ryu then catches up with Ashtar. He {{releases}} Irene, but immediately after releasing her he stabs her with the Dark Sword. Robert then shows up, only to find out that Irene has been mortally wounded; Ashtar then blasts Robert with energy from his Dark Sword and then challenges Ryu to battle. Ryu defeats Ashtar, and before he dies, he says that the forces of Darkness will soon awaken and implores the forces of Chaos to engulf the world into darkness. While he is <b>saying</b> <b>this,</b> the Dark Sword of Chaos vanishes into thin air. After Ashtar's death, Irene tells Ryu that an evil altar that Ashtar prepared to open the Gate of Darkness must be destroyed. Ryu then leaves Irene behind and tells Robert to take her and leave the World of Chaos.|$|E

25|$|This {{assumption}} {{means that}} producing the same output of either commodity {{could be done}} with the same level of capital and labour in either country. Actually, it would be inefficient to use the same balance in either country (because of the relative availability of either input factor) but, in principle this would be possible. Another way of <b>saying</b> <b>this</b> is that the per-capita productivity is the same in both countries in the same technology with identical amounts of capital.|$|E

They urge more in situ studies on Mars first, and preliminary biohazard testing in space before the samples are returned to Earth.|$|E

This leads him to hypothesize that Moses de León's wife sold the original manuscript, as parchment was very valuable, and was embarrassed by the realization of its high ancient worth, leading her to claim {{it was written by}} her husband. Rabbi Kaplan concludes <b>saying</b> <b>this</b> was the probable series of events.|$|E

Savile claimed {{the key to his}} success on Jim'll Fix It had been that he disliked children, although he later admitted to <b>saying</b> <b>this</b> to deflect scrutiny of his personal life. He did not own a computer as he did not want anybody to think he was downloading child pornography. His autobiography As it Happens (1974, reprinted as Love is an Uphill Thing, 1976) contains admissions of improper sexual conduct which appear to have passed unnoticed during his lifetime.|$|E

25|$|The {{eigenvalues}} of unitary matrices {{are pure}} phases, {{so that the}} value of a unitary conserved quantity is a complex number of unit magnitude, not a real number. Another way of <b>saying</b> <b>this</b> is that a unitary matrix is the exponential of i times a Hermitian matrix, so that the additive conserved real quantity, the phase, is only well-defined up to an integer multiple of 2π. Only when the unitary symmetry matrix is part of a family that comes arbitrarily close to the identity are the conserved real quantities single-valued, and then the demand that they are conserved become a much more exacting constraint.|$|E

At Saya's mansion, Kohta is confronted by some of Takagi's followers who demand that he surrender his weapons, but Kohta refuses <b>saying</b> <b>this</b> is the one thing he was good at and that he wants to protect Saya.

Claudia searches for Anna, but she is gone without a trace. Sandro is annoyed, <b>saying</b> <b>this</b> type of behavior is typical. They explore the island and find nothing. Sandro and Corrado decide to continue their search on the island while sending the others off to notify the authorities. Claudia decides to stay as well. Sandro, Corrado, and Claudia continue their search and end up at a shack where they stay the night. As they talk, Sandro takes offense at Claudia's suggestion that Anna's disappearance is somehow due to his neglect.|$|E
25|$|A {{function}} or map {{from one}} topological space to another is called continuous if the inverse image of any open set is open. If the function maps the real numbers {{to the real}} numbers (both spaces with the Standard Topology), then this definition of continuous {{is equivalent to the}} definition of continuous in calculus. If a continuous function is one-to-one and onto, and if the inverse of the function is also continuous, then the function is called a homeomorphism and the domain of the function is said to be homeomorphic to the range. Another way of <b>saying</b> <b>this</b> is that the function has a natural extension to the topology. If two spaces are homeomorphic, they have identical topological properties, and are considered topologically the same. The cube and the sphere are homeomorphic, as are the coffee cup and the doughnut. But the circle is not homeomorphic to the doughnut.|$|E
25|$|The {{match was}} played at Wembley Stadium on Saturday 15 June 1996. Before the game, Scotland's {{national}} anthem, Flower of Scotland, was completely {{drowned out by}} booing from English spectactors. The first half was closely fought, ending 0–0, although Scotland had the better of the chances. The introduction of Jamie Redknapp into the England team {{as a substitute for}} the second half helped to turn the match in England's favour, and they took the lead through a headed goal by Alan Shearer. Scotland were awarded a penalty kick in the 76th minute after a foul by Tony Adams on Gordon Durie, but Gary McAllister's kick was saved by the England goalkeeper David Seaman. Shortly afterwards, Paul Gascoigne, who played in Scotland for the Glasgow club Rangers, scored a second goal for England, after chipping the ball over Scottish defender Colin Hendry. In 2006, the year before he became Prime Minister, Gordon Brown drew criticism in Scotland when he was reported as saying that Gascoigne's goal was one of his favourite moments in football, although Brown subsequently denied <b>saying</b> <b>this.</b>|$|E
