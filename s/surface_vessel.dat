From Gibraltar, {{the lack of}} flying boats meant a lack of air cover after 100 miles. Nevertheless, great efforts were made with limited resources to provide cover from first to last light, the time when U-boats could use the rising and setting sun to see the silhouettes on the horizon.|$|E
25|$|Zyvex Technologies {{has also}} built a 54' {{maritime}} vessel, the Piranha Unmanned <b>Surface</b> <b>Vessel,</b> as a technology demonstrator {{for what is}} possible using CNT technology. CNTs help improve the structural performance of the vessel, resulting in a lightweight 8,000lb boat that can carry a payload of 15,000lb over a range of 2,500 miles.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} finite-time cooperative tracking for multiple <b>surface</b> <b>vessels</b> {{in the presence of}} external disturbances. A robust finite-time cooperative tracking algorithm based on terminal sliding-mode control is proposed for multiple <b>surface</b> <b>vessels.</b> In light of the leader-follower strategy, a virtual leader vessel is defined to provide reference point for other <b>surface</b> <b>vessels</b> to form the desired formation. Specifically, the proposed algorithm only requires the communication topology among the <b>surface</b> <b>vessels</b> to be a directed graph with a directed spanning tree. The robustness is achieved by compensating the upper bound of external disturbance in the control input, and the global finite-time stability is proved by Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed finite-time cooperative tracking control algorithm is demonstrated by simulation results...|$|R

25|$|The {{captain of}} Externsteine later told his captors {{that he thought}} the attack was being carried out by tanks, and he was amazed that the ships could break through the ice at the speed they did. He opined that the Americans would have to scuttle his ship as it was trapped in the ice. Externsteine was renamed East Breeze by her captors. However, by using {{explosives}} on the ice, the ship was freed. A prize crew of 36 men from both icebreakers soon had the ship under way. At the time, it was the northernmost combat operation ever undertaken by United States forces. Externsteine was the only enemy <b>surface</b> <b>vessel</b> captured by United States naval forces during World War II.|$|E
25|$|Leaving Northern Ireland on 9 March 1944, 2nd Escort Group {{moved to}} the area {{believed}} to hold the highest concentration of U-boats. Over the night of 12 March Swordfish on patrol had 28 contacts on their airborne to <b>surface</b> <b>vessel</b> radar (ASV). Their first attack was unsuccessful dropping two depth charges that failed to explode believed {{to be caused by}} faulty safety clips, during the attack the rear gunner in the Swordfish was killed by the U-boats anti-aircraft guns. The depth charges dropped short on a second attack and failed to explode on a third attack during the same night. On the night of 15 March two Swordfish got an ASV contact ahead of the escort group. Unable to see anything in the darkness they dropped flares and sea markers over the location. When the escort group arrived they picked up a contact on their ASDIC and the U-653 was sunk.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} May 1944, Nairana sailed {{with the}} 15th Escort Group. Her air group was still 835 Naval Air Squadron {{equipped}} with nine Swordfish and six Sea Hurricanes. The Swordfish patrolled day and night and some contacts were made on the air to <b>surface</b> <b>vessel</b> radar (ASV). All the contacts came to nothing; it is now known the older model ASV in Nairanas Swordfish could be detected by receivers on board U-boats. In May, they escorted convoys SL157 (Freetown to Britain) with MKS48 (Mediterranean to Britain) and the next group SL158 with MKS49. On 25 May, the convoys were located by German Junkers Ju 290 reconnaissance aircraft. From then until the next morning, they were driven off undamaged, but one Sea Hurricane failed {{to pull out of}} a dive killing the pilot. On 26 May 1944, shortly after daybreak, a Sea Hurricane piloted by Sub Lieutenant Burgham from Nairana shot down Ju290 9K+FK of FAGr5 over the Bay of Biscay. The afternoon of the same day, Sub Lieutenants Mearns and Wallis attacked two more Ju290s, Mearns shooting down 9V+GK piloted by Kurt Nonneberg, which ditched in the sea. The other Ju290 disappeared on fire into cloud and was assumed to have crashed.|$|E

500|$|Three crewmen were on duty in Greeneville sonar room.

[...] A few minutes later, they detected a second vessel estimated to be about [...] away (submarine passive sonar does not give range (distance) information), which was designated as [...] "Sierra13" [...] (S-13). [...] S-13 was Ehime Maru. [...] Also tracking the sonar contacts {{in the control room}} was Patrick Seacrest, Greenevilles sole fire control technician on duty at the time. [...] Seacrest was responsible for [...] "determining the course, speed, and range of surface and submerged vessels (or targets) potentially posing a threat to the submarine." [...] At 12:58, Seacrest designated the track of S-13 as heading away from Greenevilles location. [...] Beginning at 13:00, Seacrest elected to discontinue updating the Contact Evaluation Plot (CEP) in the control room. [...] The CEP is a [...] "labor-intensive" [...] paper display that plots ship data and contact information for reference by control room personnel.

2500|$|Despite being {{captain of}} the premier <b>surface</b> <b>vessel</b> in the U.S. Navy, Holloway {{recognized}} that naval aviation had become dominant.

[...] "The war in the Pacific is being won by the carriers. The future of the U.S. Navy lies in naval aviation."
