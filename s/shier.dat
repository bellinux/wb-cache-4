500|$|On 3 May Cunningham {{accounted}} for another Heinkel. Four nights later on 7 May 1941 Cunningham achieved a victory—his 12th—in front of King George VI. Sholto Douglas accompanied the King {{when he appeared}} at Danebury Hill, not far from Middle Wallop. The King met Cunningham and Rawnsley, [...] congratulated the airmen on their success and asked Cunningham to get another on that night. The King then was driven to the GCI station Sopley outside Bournemouth to tour the facility. Eager to impress the King, Cunningham drove to dispersal and prepared to go on patrol. The Luftwaffe began operations at 22:00 that night, attacking Liverpool which took their flight path over 604's patrol area. Cunningham took off and intercepted a He 111 north of Bournemouth. The controller asked the King to go outside as they may have the opportunity of witnessing the battle. Although they did not see it, the King heard the results; the roar of engines and rattle of cannon fire. The Heinkel, from 7./KG 27, Werknummer 1639 code IG+DR, eventually crashed near Andersea Farm south of RAF Weston Zoyland at 23:30. Pilot Oberfeldwebel Heinz Laschinski, Feldwebel Heinz <b>Shier,</b> Oberfeldwebel Otto Willrich all survived though the pilot was badly burned. Flight Engineer Feldwebel Fritz Klemm and Feldwebel Heinz <b>Shier</b> were killed by gunfire. On {{the night of the}} 31 May/1 June 1941 he {{accounted for}} another He 111 as the Luftwaffe completed its last major raid of the Blitz. It was one of 24 German bombers lost on that night. The following morning Cunningham was promoted to temporary squadron leader.|$|E

40|$|M. A. The {{present study}} {{examined}} the relationship between shyness and self-conscious emotions in terms of attribution style. Participants were administered questionnaires and then categorized into fearful <b>shy,</b> self-conscious <b>shy,</b> undifferentiated <b>shy</b> and non-shy groups. These four groups were then compared in terms of shyness, shame, guilt, embarrassment, and attribution style. Furthermore, the relationships between shame, guilt, and embarrassment and the different attribution styles were examined. The fearful <b>shy,</b> self-conscious <b>shy</b> and undifferentiated <b>shy</b> groups differed from the non-shy group in terms of the attribution styles of context and luck. The fearful <b>shy</b> group was found to score higher than the non-shy group in terms of context, in addition to the fearful <b>shy</b> as well as the self-conscious <b>shy</b> groups scoring higher than the non-shy groups in terms of luck. However no differences were found in terms of ability and effort between the four groups. With regards to experiencing self-conscious emotions, the fearful <b>shy,</b> self-conscious <b>shy,</b> and the undifferentiated <b>shy</b> groups differed from the non-shy group by scoring higher on shame. The fearful <b>shy,</b> self-conscious <b>shy,</b> and the undifferentiated <b>shy</b> groups also scored higher in terms of embarrassment from the non-shy group, with the fearful <b>shy</b> group scoring the highest followed by the self-conscious <b>shy</b> group and then the undifferentiated <b>shy</b> group. Furthermore, the fearful <b>shy</b> and undifferentiated <b>shy</b> differed from one another with the fearful <b>shy</b> group scoring higher in terms of embarrassment. The four groups, however, did not vary in terms of guilt. In terms of the relationship between attribution styles and self-conscious emotions, positive correlations were found between ability and shame and ability and embarrassment. A positive correlation was found between effort and guilt. Positive correlations between luck and shame and luck and embarrassment were also found. Self-conscious emotions were found to be highly correlated with shyness. Attribution styles may {{play a significant role in}} terms of an individual experiencing these emotions. <b>Shy</b> individuals may differ from non-shy individuals with regards to the attributions they engage in, causing them to experience self-conscious emotions to a higher extent. This may suggest a cognitive component that may be associated with self-conscious emotions. Therefore, <b>shy</b> individuals may be predisposed to experiencing self-conscious emotions more frequently than non-shy individuals. It is suggested that future research focus on this cognitive component in the experience of self-conscious emotions...|$|R

40|$|Aim. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether there are differences in <b>shy</b> behaviour of <b>shy</b> toddlers in different contexts (small circle, big circle, free play, offside). Method. The study was conducted among two groups of toddlers, all originating from the assistance plan PeuterPlus! (ToddlerPlus!). Toddlers with <b>shy</b> behaviour (N = 4) and toddlers without <b>shy</b> behaviour (N = 29) were observed in four different situations. The teachers were observed to see to what extent they supported the toddlers emotionally. It was then analyzed whether the degree of emotional support offered by teachers influenced the behaviour of the toddlers with end without shyness. Results. The results showed that, with a p value of. 05, <b>shy</b> toddlers showed significant difference in the degree of <b>shy</b> behaviour in different contexts. (Note: The group of <b>shy</b> toddlers was too small to look at the influence of emotional support from the teacher). The results also showed that in all situations there was a difference in the degree of <b>shy</b> behaviour between toddlers with and without <b>shy</b> behaviour. Besides this difference there were no other difference in the degree of embarrassment in various contexts of toddlers who are not <b>shy.</b> The degree of emotional support by the teacher did not affect the <b>shy</b> behaviour of these toddlers. Conclusion. The results are consistent with the expectation that there are differences in the degree of shyness of <b>shy</b> toddlers per context and also that there are differences between toddlers with and without <b>shy</b> behaviour in different contexts...|$|R
