The slide is reported to be the world's tallest and longest tunnel <b>slide</b> <b>at</b> 178 metres. Though it was originally reported that admission to the slide would cost around £5, the general adult price for entry to the slide and orbital is currently £16.50, with additional rides costing £5 each.|$|E
25|$|D50 is {{scientific}} {{shorthand for}} a standard illuminant: the daylight spectrum at a {{correlated color temperature}} of 5000K. Similar definitions exist for D55, D65 and D75. Designations such as D50 are used to help classify color temperatures of light tables and viewing booths. When viewing a color <b>slide</b> <b>at</b> a light table, {{it is important that}} the light be balanced properly so that the colors are not shifted towards the red or blue.|$|E
25|$|After {{establishing}} {{a connection to}} Clear Lake, the Russian River was beheaded from Clear Lake by a <b>slide</b> (<b>at</b> Cow Mountain, east of Ukiah). Now Clear Lake flows into the Sacramento River. The river incised a canyon into Fitch Mountain at an early time, before land levels were eroded to their present levels. The Russian River was prevented from flowing south into San Pablo Bay, due to a 113-foot high ridge at Cotati. Guerneville is built on an abandoned meander of the river. Near Guerneville, another meander cut short Smith Creek.|$|E

25|$|In June 1944 it was {{proposed}} that a specialised RAAF unit be formed to provide air transport for the AIB's Z Special Unit. This proposal was supported, and No. 200 Flight was formed at Leyburn, Queensland on 20 February 1945. Many of the flight's air and ground crew {{were transferred to}} it from No. 99 Squadron. The flight was controlled by the AIB and was tasked with the insertion and supply of intelligence gathering parties behind Japanese lines. Due to the secrecy of these tasks personnel from the flight were forbidden to speak about their duties at any time. No. 200 Flight's six B-24 Liberators had been modified for the unit's specialised role. The main changes were {{the removal of the}} mid-upper and ball turrets and all armour plate, the replacement of the normal radar with a Rebecca radio set and the installation of a <b>slide</b> <b>at</b> the rear of the aircraft to drop personnel and supplies.|$|E
25|$|Thermally, a {{temperate}} glacier is at {{melting point}} throughout the year, from its surface to its base. The ice of a polar glacier is always below the freezing point {{from the surface}} to its base, although the surface snowpack may experience seasonal melting. A sub-polar glacier includes both temperate and polar ice, depending on depth beneath the surface and position {{along the length of}} the glacier. In a similar way, the thermal regime of a glacier is often described by its basal temperature. A cold-based glacier is below freezing at the ice-ground interface, and is thus frozen to the underlying substrate. A warm-based glacier is above or at freezing at the interface, and is able to <b>slide</b> <b>at</b> this contact. This contrast is thought to a large extent to govern the ability of a glacier to effectively erode its bed, as sliding ice promotes plucking at rock from the surface below. Glaciers which are partly cold-based and partly warm-based are known as polythermal.|$|E

When she wins first prize in a local art competition for a portrait of Homer {{on the couch in}} his underwear, Mr. Burns commissions her to paint a portrait of him.

500|$|Saturated soils caused mudslides {{throughout}} Puerto Rico, {{although only}} one resulted in loss of life. In the hillside community of Mameyes, within Ponce, {{there was a}} block <b>slide</b> <b>at</b> around 3:00am [...] on October7. A large slab of sandstone detached from a hill, moving about [...] of material down the hill. The intense rainfall triggered the landslide, although pre-existing conditions such as a leaking water main and poor sewage flow likely contributed to the event. The landslide destroyed about 90houses, killing at least 130people; however, the death toll could have been as high as 300. This made it the deadliest single landslide on record in North America. Many of the homes in Mameyes were poorly built with tin and wood materials, and some were built on stilts. Two landslides occurred near Peñuelas, collectively damaging or destroying 13buildings.|$|E

500|$|As seismic and {{volcanic}} activity increased, volcanologists {{working for the}} USGS in its Vancouver branch prepared to observe any impending eruption. Geologist Don Swanson and others placed reflectors on and around the growing lava domes, and, on May 1, 1980, established the ColdwaterI and II observation posts to use laser ranging to measure how the distances to these reflectors changed over time as the domes deformed. Glicken monitored the volcano for two weeks, taking shelter in a trailer at the Coldwater II site located {{a little more than}} [...] northwest of the volcano. On May 18, 1980, after working for six days straight, Glicken took the day off to attend an interview for his graduate work with his professor, Richard V. Fisher, in Mammoth, California. His research adviser and mentor David A. Johnston replaced him at his post, despite expressing concerns about its safety given indications of mobile magma within the volcano. After a magnitude5.1 earthquake centered directly below the north slope triggered that part of the volcano to <b>slide</b> <b>at</b> 8:32a.m., Mount St. Helens erupted. Johnston was killed after he was enveloped by swift pyroclastic flows that traveled down the mountain's flanks at near supersonic speeds.|$|E

40|$|The {{growth of}} the nanocrystalline tribolayer {{produced}} in oxygen free high conductivity copper after sliding against 440 C stainless steel was studied. Tests were conducted on a pin-on-disk tribometer <b>at</b> <b>sliding</b> velocities of 0. 05 and 1. 0 m/s and sliding times of 0. 1 to 10, 000 s. Subsurface deformation and the {{growth of the}} tribolayer as a function of time were studied with the use of transmission electron microscopy and ion induced secondary electron microscopy. A continuous nanocrystalline tribolayer was produced after as little as 10 s of <b>sliding</b> <b>at</b> both <b>sliding</b> velocities. The tribolayer produced by <b>sliding</b> <b>at</b> 0. 05 m/s continued to grow <b>at</b> <b>sliding</b> times up to 10, 000 s and developed texture.

2500|$|On March 2, 1999, an {{attorney}} representing two girls who sustained injuries while riding a water <b>slide</b> <b>at</b> a Pennsylvania amusement park discovered {{a history of}} complaints of injuries made by riders after they had ridden the same ride. Fifteen injuries had been reported to the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture's Bureau of Ride and Measurement Standards in recent years, including six reports of injuries to riders' genital areas. [...] The Speed Slide, {{also known as the}} Super Slide, is a [...] vertical drop water slide attraction. The tort lawsuit filed sought $9,200 in medical costs and at least $50,000 in damages on behalf of one girl, age 11. The suit also sought $5,300 in medical costs and at least $100,000 in damages on behalf of the other girl, age 12.

2500|$|Environmental change {{triggered}} by the <b>slide</b> <b>at</b> Hells Gate has led to habitat destruction and depletion of salmon species. The slide altered {{the environment of the}} river by increasing turbulence and density, and salmon's ability to swim upstream was seriously disrupted as many fish, exhausted by the journey through Hells Gate, were carried back downstream. Daily alterations of water levels also hindered passage of some fish species, and Evenden even {{goes so far as to}} equate the slide to [...] "an enormous dam". The slide's impacts became visible by the decreasing amount of salmon upriver and the constant fish supply below Hells Gate. Seasonal changes in water flow led to alternating cycles of salmon’s expansion and decline, with runs coming at the beginning of the seasons faring better in the changed environment than the later runs, which experienced a more significant decline. Unable to swim upriver, salmon relocated into rivers and tributary streams that were not previously used by them, and increased fish concentration spanned up to several kilometers below the Hells Gate passage. Pink salmon have taken greater environmental toll than sockeye, as the pinks are of a smaller size and therefore, weaker swimmers than the sockeye. Salmon were forced to spawn in new places and many died without spawning or did not produce many offspring as the habitat was [...] "unsuitable." [...] Changes in [...] "racial units" [...] upstream, accounted for the majority of salmon population, were traced back to Hells Gate obstruction. As well, the majority of the salmon that did not get through the passage were females (in Spuzzum Creek the male to female ratio was 1:20). Ultimately, in the short term, salmon population declined.|$|E
