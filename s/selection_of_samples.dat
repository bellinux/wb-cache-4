40|$|Abstract: The QTL mapping {{results were}} {{compared}} with the genotypically selected and random samples {{of the same size}} on the base of a RIL population. The results demonstrated that there were no obvious differences in the trait distribution and marker seg-regation distortion between the genotypically selected and random samples with the same population size. However, a significant increase in QTL detection power, sensitivity, specificity, and QTL resolution in the genotypically selected samples were ob-served. Moreover, the highly significant effect was detected in small size of genotypically selected samples. In QTL mapping, phenotyping is a more sensitive limiting factor than genotyping so that the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> could be an attractive strat-egy for increasing genome-wide QTL mapping resolution. The efficient <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> should be more helpful for QTL maker assistant selection, fine mapping, and QTL cloning.
