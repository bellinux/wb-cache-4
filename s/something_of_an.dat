5|$|Paulet was <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eccentric. On one occasion, {{while his}} ship was moored at Spithead, {{he asked his}} admiral for {{permission}} to take leave to visit London. This was refused, with the comment that Paulet could travel as far on land as he could get in his barge. Thus challenged, Paulet loaded his barge onto a cart {{and went off to}} London anyway.|$|E
5|$|Sir William Alexander Gordon Gordon-Cumming, 4th Baronet (20 July 1848– 20 May 1930) was a Scottish landowner, soldier, adventurer and socialite. A notorious womaniser, he is {{best known}} for being the central figure in the royal baccarat scandal of 1891. After inheriting a baronetcy he joined the Army and saw service in South Africa, Egypt and the Sudan; he served with {{distinction}} and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. <b>Something</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> adventurer, he also spent time hunting in the US and India.|$|E
5|$|The film marked <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{end of an}} era for its creator. The {{director}} himself {{recognized this}} {{at the time of its}} release, telling critic Donald Richie that a cycle of some kind had just come to an end and that his future films and production methods would be different. His prediction proved quite accurate. Beginning in the late 1950s, television began increasingly to dominate the leisure time of the formerly large and loyal Japanese cinema audience. And as film company revenues dropped, so did their appetite for risk—particularly the risk represented by Kurosawa's costly production methods.|$|E

5|$|Tudor's {{plan was}} to export ice as a luxury good to wealthy members of West Indies and the {{southern}} US states, where he hoped they would relish the product during their sweltering summers; conscious of the risk that others might follow suit, Tudor hoped to acquire local monopoly rights in his new markets {{in order to maintain}} high prices and profits. He started by attempting to establish a monopoly on the potential ice trade in the Caribbean and invested in a brigantine ship to transport ice bought from farmers around Boston. At the time, Tudor was regarded by the business community at best as <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eccentric, and at worst a fool.|$|E
5|$|A {{public enquiry}} {{was held in}} 1873, to {{determine}} whether it would be advantageous for the city to be administered by a municipal corporation. The result being in the affirmative, the city council, sometimes archaically called the corporation, was founded by a Charter of Incorporation dated 17 March 1874, under the government of a mayor, six aldermen and 18 councillors. <b>Something</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> anomaly, the Parliamentary Boundary Commission of 1868 had decided that the urban parts of Fletton and Woodston were so involved in Peterborough that they ought to be in the borough and added the newly built-up portions of these parishes to the parliamentary constituency. In local matters they were still in Huntingdonshire and, as the City of Peterborough did not extend south of the River Nene, the full title of the new municipality was the City and Borough of Peterborough and its inhabitants, citizens and burgesses.|$|E
5|$|Announcing his Cabinet on 17 December 1962, Field named Smith his Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Treasury. Two days later, RA Butler, the British Deputy Prime Minister and First Secretary of State, {{announced}} that the UK government would allow Nyasaland to leave the Federation. With Northern Rhodesia now also under a secessionist black nationalist government—Kenneth Kaunda and Harry Nkumbula had formed a coalition to keep the UFP out—and Southern Rhodesia under the RF, the Federation was effectively over. The Field Cabinet made Southern Rhodesian independence on Federal dissolution its first priority, but the Conservative government in the UK was reluctant to grant this under the 1961 constitution as it knew doing so would lead to censure and loss of prestige in the United Nations (UN) and the Commonwealth. Indeed, Southern Rhodesia's minority government had already become <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> embarrassment to the UK and it hurt Britain's reputation to even {{maintain the status quo}} there. Granting independence without major constitutional reform would furthermore provoke outcry from the Conservatives' main parliamentary opposition, the Labour Party, which was strongly anti-colonial and supportive of black nationalist ambitions.|$|E

Many of the {{paintings}} she purchased were of negligible value, but she did buy paintings by Renoir, Rouault, Kandinsky, Bonnard, and Jawlensky. Her art collection was worth millions when she died in 1990.|$|E
25|$|The {{phenomenon}} of Messianic Judaism has become <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> irritant to Jewish / Christian relations. Messianic Jews—who generally seek to combine a Jewish identity with {{the recognition of}} Jesus—are rejected by mainstream Jewish groups, who dismiss Messianic Judaism {{as little more than}} Christianity with Jewish undertones.|$|E

25|$|Negative {{evidence}} is sometimes {{used as an}} alternative to absence of evidence and is often meant to be synonymous with it.

25|$|Turner was <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> invalid from 1904 onwards. Nonetheless, in 1906, at age 81, Turner, {{was still}} {{personally}} supervising work at his shipyard, {{and found himself}} suddenly swamped with work following the San Francisco earthquake. He decided to retire. He died on February 10, 1909 {{at the age of}} 83 years after a short illness at his home in Oakland.|$|E
25|$|The film also {{spawned the}} Star Wars Holiday Special, which debuted on CBS on November 17, 1978 {{and is often}} {{considered}} a failure; Lucas himself disowned it. The special has never been aired after its original broadcast, and {{it has never been}} officially released on home video. However, many bootleg copies exist, and the special has consequently become <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> underground legend.|$|E
