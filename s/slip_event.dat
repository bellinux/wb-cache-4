30|$|A {{series of}} studies also showed the {{segmentation}} of rupture areas in the dipping direction near the Bungo channel area, southwest Japan. In this area, ordinary earthquakes occur in a seismogenic zone, while slow <b>slip</b> <b>events</b> occur in the transition area between the shallow locked zone and the deeper unlocked zone. Short-term slow <b>slip</b> <b>events</b> {{with a duration of}} several days appear to occur in the deeper part of the above-mentioned transient zone where low-frequency earthquakes occur (see Fig.  1 a) (Obara 2002), while long-term slow <b>slip</b> <b>events,</b> which last more than several months, occur in the shallower area of the transition zone up-dip of the low-frequency earthquake area (e.g., Hirose and Obara 2005; Ozawa et al. 2013; Takagi et al. 2016). In addition, Yarai and Ozawa (2013) showed that the afterslip and long-term slow <b>slip</b> <b>events</b> occur in a region deeper than the coseismic slip area in the Hyuga-nada region, southwest Japan.

50|$|Where megathrust {{earthquakes}} (M>8) {{have been}} repeatedly {{observed in the}} shallow sections (<25 km depth) of the Cascadia subduction zone, low frequency earthquakes have recently been discovered to occur at greater depths, down-dip of the seismogenic zone. The first indicator of low frequency earthquakes in Cascadia was discovered in 1999 when an aseismic event {{took place at the}} subduction interface wherein the overriding North American Plate slipped 2 centimeters south-west over a several week period as recorded by Global Positioning System (GPS) sites in British Columbia. This apparent slow <b>slip</b> <b>event</b> occurred over a 50-by-300-kilometer area and took approximately 35 days. Researchers estimated that the energy released in such an event would be equivalent to a magnitude 6-7 earthquake, yet no significant seismic signal was detected. The aseismic character of the event led observers to conclude that the slip was mediated by ductile deformation at depth. After further analysis of the GPS record, these reverse slip events were found to repeat at 13- to 16-month intervals, and last 2 to 4 weeks at any one GPS station. Soon after, geophysicists were able to extract the seismic signatures from these slow slip events and found that they were akin to tremor and classified the phenomenon as episodic tremor and slip (ETS). Upon the advent of improved processing techniques, and the discovery that LFEs form part of tremor, low frequency earthquakes were widely considered a commonplace occurrence at the plate interface down-dip of the seismogenic zone in Cascadia.|$|E
5000|$|The depth {{occurrence}} of low frequency earthquakes {{is in the}} range of approximately 20-45 kilometers depending on the subduction zone, and at shallower depths at strike-slip faults in California. At [...] "warm" [...] subduction zones like the west coast of North America, or sections in eastern Japan this depth corresponds to a transition or transient slip zone between the locked and stable slip intervals of the plate interface. The transition zone is located at depths approximately coincidental with the continental Mohorovicic discontinuity. At the Cascadia subduction zone, the distribution of LFEs form a surface roughly parallel to intercrustal seismic events, but displaced 5-10 kilometers down-dip, providing evidence that LFEs are generated at the plate interface.Low frequency earthquakes are an active area of research and may be important seismic indicators for higher magnitude earthquakes. Since slow slip events and their corresponding LFE signals have been recorded, none of them have been accompanied by a megathrust earthquake, however, SSEs act to increase the stress in the seismogenic zone by forcing the locked interval between the subducting and overriding plate to accommodate for down-dip movement. Some calculations find that the probability of a large earthquake occurring during a slow <b>slip</b> <b>event</b> are 30-100 times greater than background probabilities. Understanding the seismic hazard that LFEs might herald is among the primary reasons for their research. Additionally, LFEs are useful for the tomographic imaging of subduction zones because their distributions accurately map the deep plate contact near the Mohorovicic discontinuity.|$|E

Unique characteristics of slow <b>slip</b> <b>events</b> include periodicity on timescales of months to years, focus near or down-dip of the locked zone, and along-strike propagation of 5 to 15 km/d. In contrast, a typical earthquake rupture velocity is 70 to 90% of the S-wave velocity, or approximately 3.5 km/s.|$|R
30|$|Whereas the {{seismicity}} rate {{changes we}} observe {{may be explained}} by various models, our preferred explanation is that it is caused by a long-term slow <b>slip</b> <b>event</b> (LSSE) rather than, for example, a dilatancy model or an earthquake interaction model. For an interpretation of the foreshock sequence (Hirose et al., 2011) prior to the 2011 Tohoku earthquake (M 9.0), there are two conflicting hypotheses: a slow <b>slip</b> <b>event</b> model (Ando and Imanishi, 2011; Kato et al., 2012) and an earthquake interaction model (Marsan and Enescu, 2012; Gusman et al., 2013).

40|$|Since their {{discovery}} {{two decades}} ago(1, 2), slow slip events {{have been shown}} {{to play an important role}} in accommodating strain in subduction zones. However, the physical mechanisms that generate slow slip and the relationships with earthquakes are unclear. Slow slip events have been recorded in the Guerrero segment of the Cocos-North America subduction zone(2, 3). Here we use inversion of position time series recorded by a continuous GPS network to reconstruct the evolution of aseismic slip on the subduction interface of the Guerrero segment. We find that a slow <b>slip</b> <b>event</b> began in February 2014, two months before the magnitude (M-w) 7. 3 Papanoa earthquake on 18 April. The slow <b>slip</b> <b>event</b> initiated in a region adjacent to the earthquake hypocentre and extended into the vicinity of the seismogenic zone. This spatio-temporal proximity strongly suggests that the Papanoa earthquake was triggered by the ongoing slow <b>slip</b> <b>event.</b> We demonstrate that the triggering mechanism could be either static stress increases in the hypocentral region, as revealed by Coulomb stress modelling, or enhanced weakening of the earthquake hypocentral area by the slow slip. We also show that the plate interface in the Guerrero area is highly coupled between slow slip events, and that most of the accumulated strain is released aseismically during the slow slip episodes...|$|E

40|$|Slowly {{compressed}} microcrystals deform via intermittent <b>slip</b> <b>events,</b> observed as displacement jumps or stress drops.

With increasing plastic strain, the <b>slip</b> <b>events</b> are found to be smaller and more frequent when strain driven, and the slip-size distributions obtained for both drives collapse onto the same scaling function with the same exponents.

40|$|To better {{understand}} the physical mechanisms of slow <b>slip</b> <b>events</b> (SSEs) detected worldwide, we explore the scaling relationships of various source parameters and compare them with similar scaling laws for earthquakes. These scaling relationships highlight differences and similarities between slow <b>slip</b> <b>events</b> and earthquakes and hold implications for the degree of heterogeneity and fault-healing characteristics. That static drop remains constant for different-sized events as is observed for earthquakes. However, the static stress drop of slow slop events is within a range of 0. 01 - 1. 0 MPa, 1 - 2 orders of magnitiude lower than that found for earthquakes, which {{could be related to}} the low stress state on the fault. The average rupture velocity, ranging from kilometers per second to kilometers per day, decreases linearly with increasing seismic moment in log-log space, unlike earthquakes that are nearly constant. This inverse relationship of rupture velocity with seismic moment could be related to the heterogeneity of fault properties. Slow <b>slip</b> <b>events</b> typically have ratios of event duration over dislocation rise time less than 3, while earthquakes have ratios greater than 3. This indicates that slow <b>slip</b> <b>events</b> are less pulselike than earthquakes in their mode of propagation and suggests that the healing behind the rupture front is delayed.
