50|$|Infestations of H. suis are {{not usually}} lethal to the hosts, but major {{economic}} losses are ascribed to impaired growth, general irritation, and immune responses to the lice. Estimated economic losses due to hog lice infections are from 10 to 50 million dollars a year. H. suis is the vector of <b>swine</b> <b>pox</b> in hogs. It also transmits hog cholera, considered the most important health concern for swine, hog lice being the second.|$|E
5000|$|Swinepox is a {{worldwide}} {{disease of the}} pig, caused by a virus of the family Poxviridae and the genus Suipoxvirus. It {{is the most common}} cause of pox disease in pigs, with vaccinia virus being the next most common cause of outbreaks. [...] It is a mild to severe disease depending on the louse it was contracted from. Symptoms include papules and pustules on the skin of the abdomen. Characteristic lesions on the lower abdomen have dark hemorrhagic centers. [...] Swinepox is transmitted by direct contact and by the pig louse, Hematopinus suis. Often the hooves go crusty due to the animals water content in its body being used for fighting the infection. This in serious <b>Swine</b> <b>pox</b> cases can cause malformed hoofs and damage the ability for the pig to walk properly. In some extremely rare cases, the genetics of the animal can be changed by this disease but go unnoticed in terms of physical symptoms; this, if contracted by breeding pigs is very threatening for the potential baby piglets to be born. Piglets born from parents that both have the severest strain of the disease will be born frequently with disfigurements such as a tail that is bulbous, and crooked snouts. The inside of the animal is also affected by the genetic strain by making the muscles and fat of the animal pus filled and also weakens the piglets organs overtime resulting in death.|$|E
40|$|An {{outbreak}} of <b>swine</b> <b>pox</b> on a pig farm in Ibadan, Nigeria is reported. Diagnosis {{was based on}} clinical and pathological signs and the observation of poxvirus particles in a serum sample. Neonatal deaths were common in the outbreak. Indigenous pigs did not show any sign of the disease even though mixed breeds were kept in the same pens. It is suggested that indigenous pigs were probably carriers of the <b>swine</b> <b>pox</b> virus. LR: 20061115; PUBM: Print; JID: 0031164; ppublishSource type: Electronic(1...|$|E
40|$|Summary: A ISO-sow farrow-to-finish {{operation}} had {{a history}} of endemic skin problems in sows and pigs for 2 years. A complete investigation, including skin biopsies, cultural examination and sensitivity, blood samples, and nutritional and building evaluation, was conducted to identify possible causes. Results showed a dermatomycosis (ringworm infection), Staphylococcus hyicus infection, possible nutritional deficiencies, and housing inadequacies, causing these endemic conditions. A control program, which included washing sows, using antibiotics and autogenous vaccines, changing processing techniques, adding supplemental micronutrients, and modifying buildings, was initiated. These changes were followed by rapid improvement in the skin problems. The multiple control programs make it difficult to attribute the improvement to anyone change or treatment. A 150 -sow farrow-to-finish operation in Washingtonstate had been experiencinga dermatitis problem in their sows and pigs for 2 years. Numerous attempts were made by veterinarians and feed company representatives to diagnose and control the problem without results. This herd sells 50 % of its pigs at 41 - 54 kg (90 - 120 lb) to a roaster market, and the packer had begun refusing the roaster pigs because of the skin problems. Skin problems are common in intensifiedhog production. 2 Parasitic, bacterial, viral, and fungal infections as well as nutritional deficiencieswere considered as possible causes. 1 - 3 Commonparasitic problems are usuallyrelated to sarcoptic mangeor lice. 1 Viral agents include porcine parvovirus and <b>swine</b> <b>pox.</b> 2 Bacterial agents include Staphylococcus hyicus, beta-hemolytic streptococci, Actinomyces pyogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 2 Fungalagentsinclude Candida albicans, Microsporum spp., an...|$|E
