5|$|The {{previous}} state {{internet traffic}} are routed through a hub in Malaysia's capital of Kuala Lumpur, {{passing through a}} <b>submarine</b> <b>cable</b> connecting the Peninsular with Kota Kinabalu. The systems are considered as costly and inefficient especially due {{to the price of}} leasing bandwidth with the large distance. In 2000, there is a plan to establish Sabah own internet hub but the plan was unreachable due to the high cost and low usage rates in the state. Other alternative plan including using the Brunei internet gateway in a short term before establishing Sabah own gateway. By 2016, the federal government has start to establish the first internet gateway for East Malaysia with the laying of 60 terabyte <b>submarine</b> <b>cable</b> which are developed by a private company named Xiddig Cellular Communications Sdn. Bhd. {{at a cost of about}} RM850 million through the Private Funding Initiative (PFI). Under the 2015 Malaysian Budget project of 1Malaysia Cable System Project (SKR1M), a new <b>submarine</b> <b>cable</b> for high speed internet has been built from Kota Kinabalu to Pahang in the Peninsular which completed in 2017. The 1Malaysia <b>submarine</b> <b>cable</b> system linking the state capital with Miri, Bintulu and Kuching in Sarawak together with Mersing in Johor with an increase of bandwidth capacity up to 12 terabyte per second. Another <b>submarine</b> <b>cable,</b> the BIMP-EAGA Submarine and Terrestrial (BEST) Cable Project is currently being built from Kota Kinabalu to Tawau to connecting Sabah with Brunei, Kalimantan and Mindanao which will be completed in 2018. In early 2016, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the state government and China's largest networking company, Huawei to set Sabah to become information and communications technology (ICT) hub by leveraging on Huawei's ICT expertise. More free high speed Wi-Fi hotspots are being planned in Sabah, especially to the state capital.|$|E
5|$|A {{transmission}} line {{is required to}} bring the generated power to (often remote) markets. For an off-shore station this may require a <b>submarine</b> <b>cable.</b> Construction of a new high-voltage line may be too costly for the wind resource alone, but wind sites may take advantage of lines installed for conventionally fueled generation.|$|E
5|$|Damage Sustained by the System. Contrary to {{what was}} done in other places, {{electricity}} was not shut down in Grand Cayman before arrival of the hurricane. Total system failure came at around 01:40 hours on 12 September. Slight damage was sustained by the North Sound Road power plant, and more extensive damage occurred in transmission lines and several substations {{as well as in}} distribution grids. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} <b>submarine</b> <b>cable</b> in the North Sound was damaged 1,500 feet offshore.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, {{following}} a 1989 {{failure of the}} <b>submarine</b> <b>cable</b> and problems with the diesel generator, the light was converted to solar power with battery storage. The caretaker stayed in the premises until March 1991, when lease arrangement difficulties and the previous failure of the mains forced the caretaker's withdrawal. It only took until September 1991 for vandals to destroy the keepers' cottages by fire. In 1992 the Australian Construction Services cleared the site and stabilised some of the building elements, and a security fence was installed.|$|E

5|$|The name of Zobel is, perhaps, most {{well known}} {{with regard to}} {{impedance}} compensation networks for loudspeakers. Clearly, his designs have applications in this field. However, none of Zobel's patents or articles appear to discuss this topic. It is unclear whether he actually designed anything specifically for loudspeakers. The closest we get to {{this is where he}} speaks of impedance matching into a transducer, but here he is discussing a circuit to equalize a <b>submarine</b> <b>cable,</b> or in another instance where clearly he has in mind the hybrid transformer which terminates a line going into a telephone instrument on a phantom circuit.|$|E

A cable laying ship, the SS Mernoo, was chartered, and two old cables that {{ran across the}} Bass Strait were lifted and re-laid across the Torres Strait in October 1943. When the land {{connections}} were completed in December 1943, it became possible {{to send a message}} all the way from Melbourne to Port Moresby. Simpson, who was on an inspection tour of New Guinea, was on hand for the receipt of the first message. In November 1944, he visited the front in the Netherlands, Belgium and France, returning to Australia via the United States and Canada.|$|E
5|$|The {{shipping}} channel {{approaching the}} Fox River in Green Bay was changed {{a number of}} times in order to accommodate vessels of increasing draft. The Army Corps of Engineers also modified the channel in the mid 1920's. The Green Bay Harbor Entrance buoy was established in 1927 to mark this point until the Bureau of Lighthouses could obtain funds for a more permanent solution. The acetylene buoy emitted a flash of 0.3 seconds duration every 3 seconds and had a wave-activated bell. The light {{is one of the few}} on the Great Lakes still powered by <b>submarine</b> <b>cable.</b> It is issued from a pair of 300mm Tideland Signal ML300 acrylic optics mounted on the gallery railing. Because the light is too far out to be seen well from shore, the only good view of it is from a boat.|$|E
5|$|Establishing a {{partnership}} with Robert Stirling Newall in 1850, Bell set up the first factory {{in the world with}} machines able to manufacture steel rope and <b>submarine</b> <b>cable.</b> Two years later his brothers Thomas Bell and John Bell joined him to build a major iron works at Port Clarence, Middlesbrough on the north bank of the River Tees. By 1853 there were three blast furnaces, each with a capacity of just over 6000 cubic feet, making them the largest in Britain at the time. The works produced iron for bridges and steel rails for railways across the British Empire including the North Eastern Railway company, of which Bell was a director from 1864 onwards, and deputy chairman from 1895 until his death. The Bell brothers' company operated its own ironstone mines at Normanby and Cleveland, and its own limestone quarries in Weardale, employing about 6000 men in mining and manufacturing. By 1878 the firm was producing 200,000 tons of iron per annum. Bell was a professional metallurgist and industrial chemist, constantly pioneering processes such as the recycling of heat from escaping flue gases, and trialling many process improvements.|$|E

5|$|Telecommunication in Sabah and Sarawak were {{originally}} administered by Posts and Telecommunication Department until 1967, and {{maintained by the}} British Cable & Wireless Communications before all telecommunications management in the state been takeover by Peninsular-based company. The British telecommunication company have establish a <b>submarine</b> <b>cable</b> that linking Kota Kinabalu with Singapore and Hong Kong. Following {{the expansion of the}} Peninsular-based company on 1 January 1968, Sabah Posts and Telecommunication Department was merged with the Peninsular telecommunication department to formed Telecommunications Department Malaysia. All operations under Telecommunications Department Malaysia was then transferred to Syarikat Telekom Malaysia Berhad (STM) which become a public listed company in 1991 with the federal government retained a majority shareholding. There are also other telecommunication companies operating in the state although only providing cellular phone facilities. In 2006, the state has the lowest Direct Exchange Line (DEL) penetration rate, with cellular and internet dial-up penetrations rate only 6.5 per 100 inhabitants. Most residents from the low income groups would rather use mobile phones internet or use internet at their offices instead of setting up internet access at home as the Malaysian main internet provider of Telekom Malaysia were unable to build high speed low cost internet due to the high cost of equipment which are mostly sourced from abroad. Until the end of 2014, there were only 934 telecommunication hotspots in Sabah. Due to this, the government are working to increase the penetration and capability of internet connection as well {{to bridge the gap between}} Sabah and the Peninsular. The mobile telecommunications in Sabah are mostly use 4G and 3G and there is free rural Wi-Fi services provided by the federal government known as the Kampung Tanpa Wayar 1Malaysia (KTW) although Malaysia's public internet speeds are among the slower than many other countries.|$|E
