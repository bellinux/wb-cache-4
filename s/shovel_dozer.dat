40|$|Abstract: Automatic {{weighing}} {{plays an}} important part in many fields of applications: Large quantities of commodities and raw materials are handled in trading centres using automatic belt weighers or totalizing hopper weighers for bulk-to-bulk weighing, smaller quantities of commodities being meant for end users are automatically filled and weighed by gravimetric filling instruments, by catchweighers or checkweighers. Commodities transported on vehicles or by rail are often weighed automatically by in-motion road vehicle weighing instruments or automatic rail-weighbridges, respectively. New developments and measurement techniques are especially observed in the field of waste disposal, weighing of container wagons in cross-border traffic, <b>shovel</b> <b>dozers</b> for weighing building materials, and automation of processes in the food and non-food industry. This paper is intended to give a survey {{on the state of the}} art in automatic weighing and on international efforts (eg. OIML) towards harmonization of specifications and test procedures for automatic weighing instruments...|$|R

GET protects expensive equipment from {{the wear and tear}} common in high-impact or high-abrasion environments (from hard rock mining to dredging and oil sands extraction). GET includes such wear parts as tooth systems, buckets, blades, end bits, couplers, thumbs, ripper systems, lip systems, dozer packages, liner packages, shrouds, chain, chain sprockets, traction wheels, and shredder hammer components.|$|R
40|$|In {{the mining}} industry, it is {{observed}} that sudden break-down of any equipment may stop the entire system, resulting in drastic production losses and enhancing the cost production. In this paper, the probability of sudden break down of each equipment are individually analyzed from their previous performances where the frequency of occurrences, duration and the time-interval of each breakdown has given an additional stress and the non-availability of that equipment on the entire system is discussed. Computerized best fit matching is found out for preventive maintenance of this equipment by developing different sub-routines and simulation models. Optimum utilization of those equipment shows a particular steady- state production from the mine. Advanced technology is used for the operation of the open-pit mining. Hazard due to open cast mining is less than that of underground mines and the recent trend is to adopt the former one. For the mechanization, different types of machineries are used, such as <b>shovel,</b> dumper, <b>dozer,</b> drill machines, etc. use of more machineries increases the complexity of the operation and as a result {{it is very difficult to}} the proper matching of these equipment’s. As these machineries are very costly so unless they are properly matched, reduction in production cost is not possible. Sudden breakdown of one equipment may stop the production from whole mine. So it is needed to analyze the breakdown data by statistical approach to find out the possibility of breakdown of that particular equipment and ask for preventive maintenance. This analysis needed the help of computer for simulating the whole mining system to judge the performance of each equipment. This paper deals with the computerized best fit matching, for preventive maintenance of equipment. ...|$|R
40|$|Open cast mining in the today’s {{world has}} cyclic reappearance with {{prominent}} role in to mining sphere. Now-a-days the extent of mineral own by open cast mining is increases from year to year. This {{is due to the}} rapid strides made in the field of manufacture of open pit machinery. There has been a design explosion in the field of machinery, which have grown into enormous sizes with production capacities hitherto unimagined. The major part of initial capital investment in any opencast mining goes towards the transportation and excavation equipment, their objective is to get maximum return per unit of investment. Time loss in operation due to idleness, breakdown of machine is no more affordable to mine management in recent years. Improper utilization of HEMM have negative consequences on the production, productivity and production cost leading to loss of revenue. So it is important to analyses the performance of those equipment, at regular intervals to achieve cost- effectiveness in excavation and transportation operations. An attempt has been made in this project to calculate the percentage availability and utilisation of <b>shovel,</b> dumpers and <b>dozer</b> and other HEEMs deployed in an opencast mine of Gopinathpur mine,Mugma area, Eastern Coalfield Limited & Jeenagora mine, Lodna area Bharat Coking Coalfield Limited and to analyses the contributing factors to improve the overall equipment performance...|$|R
40|$|The need of {{iron ore}} as {{material}} for steel industry in 2006 increased, so the are many iron ore mine activity in Kabupaten Tanah Laut, South Kalimantan. There are 25 cooperation contract between Pememerintah Daerah owned Company, PT Baratala Tuntung Pandang, as owner of contract {{of work for}} Iron Ore Mine, five companies have contracts of Mining Work and three companies have contracts of expolration work. The iron ore production increased from 115, 658. 484 MT in 2006 to 445, 286 MT. The objectives of study is to delineate the iron mine activities in Kabupaten Tanah Laut, Kalimantan Selatan Province. The small scale mine of Iron ore involved the local people and semi mechanic equipment such back hoe, Bull <b>Dozer,</b> <b>shovel</b> and rock breaker for breake the source rock. Meanwhile there some grizllies to seperate the iron ore based on the size. The size of iron ore are lump ore to fine ore to stockpile. The survey iron ore mine are in Pemalongan, Sumber Mulia (three cooperationcontract) and Sungai Riam (three cooperation contract). The production iron ore of local mine people in the three mine ore location are prized from Rp. 4000,- per pack to Rp. 8000,- per pack. The iron ore quality of a pack id about 40 Kg to 50 Kg, and the quality based on the visual only. The Mine Iron environment quality management should be increased to keep the environment quality under control for the easier reclamation in the closure mine in post mine time...|$|R
40|$|Aims: This study {{aimed to}} monitor the {{vibration}} levels of mining machinery and duration of exposure to vibration; to study work practices of operators of mining machineries and to predict health risk from vibration exposure to operators. Materials and Methods: Vibration levels of 157 mining equipment including dumpers, dozers, etc. in 10 opencast mines were measured through accelerometer and recorded in vibration analyzer. Root mean square (RMS) values of acceleration as well as vibration dose values along with duration of exposures per day were used to predict health risk in accordance with ISO 2631 - 1 : 1997 standard. Video records of equipment operation were used to analyze job components. Results: Health risk was evaluated using RMS acceleration (0. 21 - 1. 82 m/s 2) and corresponding daily durations of exposure (2 - 7. 5 h). Forty two (27 %) of the equipment showed minimal health risk, 83 (53 %) equipment showed moderate and 32 (20 %) equipment showed high health risk to operators. While shovels and excavators showed minimal health risk, dozers and dumpers showed high health risk potential. x-axis was the dominant axis of vibration for loaders and dozers, whereas {{for the majority of}} dumpers and tippers, z-axis was dominant. Conclusion: Dumpers require engineering control for reducing the vibration in z-axis while measures are required for x-axis in loaders or <b>dozers.</b> <b>Shovels</b> or excavators do not require immediate attention except regular monitoring. Improvement in work practices are required to safeguard the workers from vibration related illness. It is recommended that proper guidelines for measurement and control of vibration at workplace should be formulated...|$|R
