50|$|Standard roller screws are {{typically}} identified by <b>screw</b> <b>diameter</b> (typically ranging from 3.5mm - 200mm) and lead (1mm - 62mm). The threading of the screw (3 - 6 starts) is either rolled (lower capacity) or ground (higher capacity). The diameters of the nut and rollers (7 - 14 in quantity) are simple {{functions of the}} <b>screw</b> <b>diameter</b> and lead.|$|E
50|$|Coarse threads {{are those}} with larger pitch (fewer threads per axial distance), and fine threads are those with smaller pitch (more threads per axial distance). Coarse threads {{have a larger}} threadform {{relative}} to <b>screw</b> <b>diameter,</b> where fine threads have a smaller threadform relative to <b>screw</b> <b>diameter.</b> This distinction is analogous to that between coarse teeth and fine teeth on a saw or file, or between coarse grit and fine grit on sandpaper.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{was based on}} presumption that the changes in {{size and shape of}} wood particles are expected to have certain impact on the particleboard quality in general. Since the conventional particleboard (PB) and oriented strand board (OSB) were built of the quite diverse wood particles, they present interesting specimens in the comparison tests. In this work, the influence of the wood particles type on the edge screw holding performance of conventional particleboard and OSB was investigated. Those tests were obtained with the <b>screw</b> <b>diameters</b> of 4. 0 mm, 4. 5 mm and 5 mm. Depth of embedment was 30 mm for all tests and with the pilot-hole diameter kept in the range of 80 - 90 % in respect of the <b>screw</b> root <b>diameter.</b> Additional tests of the thickness density profile and tensile strength perpendicular {{to the surface of the}} board were conducted. Since the middle layer structure of the particleboard embeds the screw body, both mentioned parameters are considered important in the aspect of the quality of the edge screw holding performance. In order to have further insight into the conformation of the middle layer the image survey was obtained on the split board section presenting the surface of the middle layer. Significant differences in the SWR performance of OSB and PB was recorded at all <b>screw</b> <b>diameters.</b> For the <b>screw</b> withdrawal tests parameters OSB samples showed 56 - 73 % superior mean values then conventional PB. On the other hand, the OSB showed wider dispersions of measured withdrawal forces at all <b>screw</b> <b>diameters,</b> which might present some of the problems in certain engineering and project calculations...|$|R

The brick base is one storey high with a three-storey smock on top. Both smock and cap are thatched. The mill is winded by tailpole and winch. The four common sails with Fok system have a span of 19.50 m and are carried on a cast-iron windshaft cast by foundry De Prins van Oranje in 1889 as number 1360.

At the lower end of the upright shaft the crown wheel (42 cogs) drives the steel Archimedes' screw via a gear wheel with 39 cogs.

40|$|Abstract: Historically, small extruders, (defined here {{as about}} one inch or smaller <b>screw</b> <b>diameters)</b> had notorious feeding {{problems}}. These feeding problems have, in turn, caused surges. This paper describes innovations {{that change the}} feeding characteristics of small screws and a Surge Suppression Device. History: Most feed stocks are pelletized. Most commonly, they {{take the form of}} spheroids, and cylinders though they may be cubes or hexagonal. Typical pellets have are nominally 0. 13 inch (1 / 8 inch) but many pellets have a major dimension about 50 % larger or about 0. 19 inch (3 / 16 inch). The majority of extruded plastics are processed through large extruders. However, in the medical industry the cross sections of products such as catheters are so small that extruders must be correspondingly small. Large extruders that run very slowly suffer from long residence time and subsequent polymer degradation. Small extruders, on the other hand, can process plastics at conventional screw speeds thus avoiding degradation. However, as extruder screws get smaller, conventional pellets become relatively larger. Over time, several problems were identified: 1) Packing Density: Pellets must fit in the feed channel of the extruder screw. If you desig...|$|R
40|$|The LVL-concrete {{composite}} (LCC) {{structure is}} a hybrid in system which the LVL member is well {{connected to the}} concrete slab by a connector to produce composite action.

30|$|The {{effect of}} {{diameter}} on mini-implant stability {{has been compared}} by many authors. Miyawaki et al. [4] (2003) and Seon et al. [7] (2003) reported that {{the diameter of the}} mini-implant affected the success rate the most, as compared to the other dimensional parameters. The diameter also affects the placement and removal of the mini-implant, which in turn affects the stability as well. Barros et al. [23] showed that an increase in mini-implant diameters significantly influenced the increases of placement torque and fracture torque on quantities that progressively reduced the fracture risk. Lee et al. [24] in their study showed that mini-implants with larger diameters and tapered shapes caused greater microdamage to the cortical bone. This they believe in turn might affect bone remodeling and the stability of the mini-implants. Lui et al. [25] believe that the <b>screw</b> <b>diameter</b> was the dominant factor for mini-implant mechanical responses. They showed both that bone stress and screw displacement decreased with increasing <b>screw</b> <b>diameter</b> and cortex thickness and decreasing exposed length of the screw, force magnitude, and oblique loading direction. Differences in implant diameter could also influence other aspects of implant integration, such as induction of remodeling, and could interact with other factors of mini-implants (e.g., when the implant is loaded) to influence microdamage [26].|$|E
40|$|Purpose. This study {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} recycling process on the torsional strength of mini-implants. Materials and Methods. Two hundred mini-implants were divided into 4 groups with 50 screws equally distributed in five diameters (1. 3 to 1. 7 [*]mm) : control group (CG) : unused mini-implants, G 1 : mini-implants inserted in pig iliac bone and removed, G 2 : same protocol of group 1 followed by sonication for cleaning and autoclave sterilization, and G 3 : same insertion protocol of group 1 followed by sonication for cleaning before and after sandblasting (Al 2 O 3 - 90 [*]µ) and autoclave sterilization. G 2 and G 3 mini-implants were weighed after recycling process to evaluate weight loss (W). All the screws were broken to determine the fracture torque (FT). The influence of recycling process on FT and W was evaluated by ANOVA, Mann-Whitney, and multiple linear regression analysis. Results. FT was not influenced by recycling protocols even when sandblasting was added. Sandblasting caused weight loss due to abrasive mechanical stripping of screw surface. <b>Screw</b> <b>diameter</b> was the only variable that affected FT. Conclusions. Torsional strengths of screws that underwent the recycling protocols were not changed.
