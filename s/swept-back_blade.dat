40|$|A {{recently}} completed demonstration project, funded partly by the Wisconsin Focus on Energy program and Wisconsin Public Service Corporation, shows {{the effectiveness of}} an energy efficient repulper rotor design {{compared with that of}} a conventional rotor. We conducted a demonstration to measure the performance and energy consumption of the energy efficient virgin pulp repulper of Wausau Paper in Rhinelander, Wisconsin. This paper describes the demonstration setting, shows the analysis, and discusses the results. Careful monitoring of the batch repulping operation gave us a very good picture of the energy savings. We monitored the energy use and impact on pulp quality under the following three conditions: 1. The existing conventional repulping blade (HOG rotor) 2. A new conventional repulping blade of the same style (spare HOG rotor) 3. A new energy efficient repulping blade (HM rotor) The HM rotor, a tall, <b>swept-back</b> <b>blade</b> design, has been engineered to provide effective turbulence of the fiber suspension and maximum rotor-fiber contact while consuming low horsepower...|$|E
5|$|True to its name, the winghead shark's cephalofoil {{consists}} {{of a pair of}} long, narrow, and gently <b>swept-back</b> <b>blades.</b> The width of the cephalofoil is equal to 40–50% of the shark's total length. The front of the cephalofoil has a slight indentation in the middle and a gentle bump on each side in front of the nostrils. Each nostril is roughly twice as long as the width of the mouth and extends along almost the entire leading margin of each blade. The circular eyes, located at the forward outer corners of the cephalofoil, are equipped with protective nictitating membranes. The relatively small, arched mouth contains 15–16 upper and 14 lower tooth rows on each side, and sometimes also a single row of tiny teeth at the upper and/or lower symphyses (jaw midpoints). The teeth are small and smooth-edged, with angled triangular cusps. Five pairs of gill slits are seen, with the fifth pair over the pectoral fin origins.|$|R
50|$|It {{would have}} come in two thrust ratings, 104000 lbf kN and 114000 lbf kN, and has been tested up to 117000 lbf kN. As Boeing's thrust {{requirements}} increased, Rolls-Royce began developing the 115000 lbf kN 8115 {{which was to be}} an enlarged version of the 8104, with a 3.05 m fan and a core scaled up 2.5 percent from the 8104. It featured <b>swept-back</b> fan <b>blades</b> and a host of new technologies such as contra-rotating spools.The 8115 was never built, as Boeing signed a contract with General Electric to be the sole supplier of engines for the 777X aircraft, owing to GEs willingness to risk-share on the airframe part of the project, and sales of the aircraft to GECAS.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA solver is {{developed}} aiming at efficiently predicting rotor noise in hover and forward flight. In this solver, the nonlinear near-field solutions are calculated by a hybrid approach {{which includes the}} Navier–Stokes and Euler equations based on a moving-embedded grid system and adaptive grid methodology. A combination of the third-order upwind scheme and flux-difference splitting scheme, instead of the second-order center-difference scheme which may cause larger wake dissipation, has been employed in the present computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. The sound pressure data in the near field can be calculated directly by solving the Navier–Stokes equations, and the sound propagation can be predicted by the Kirchhoff method. A harmonic expansion approach is presented for rotor far-field noise prediction, which gives an analytical expression for the integral function in the Kirchhoff formula. As a result, the interpolation process is simplified and the efficiency and accuracy of the interpolation are improved. Then, the high-speed impulsive (HIS) noise of a helicopter rotor at different tip Mach numbers and on different observers is calculated and analyzed in hover and forward flight, which shows a highly directional characteristic of the rotor HIS noise with a maximum value in the rotor plane, and the HSI noise weakens rapidly with the increasing of the directivity angle. In order to investigate {{the effects of the}} rotor blade-tip shape on its aeroacoustic characteristics, four kinds of blade tips are designed and their noise characteristics have been simulated. At last, a new unconventional CLOR-II blade tip has been designed, and the noise characteristics of the presented CLOR-II model rotor have been simulated and measured compared to the reference rotors with a rectangular or <b>swept-back</b> platform <b>blade</b> tip. The results demonstrate that the unconventional CLOR-II blade tip can significantly reduce the HSI noise of a rotor...|$|R
