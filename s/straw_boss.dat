25|$|Bill Phelps {{enlarged}} his holdings, and his herd, {{which had}} grown to over 1000 head of cattle {{by the time of}} his death in 1903. When he died at the age of 51, his one-third share of the Amity Valley property was left to Duge, who then controlled two-thirds of the original homestead. In addition, in order to settle the values of the property distribution of their brothers will, Elizabeth, who had received more valuable property in New Mexico, gave the remaining third of the Amity homestead to Duge. Duge was considered very accomplished and liberated for a woman of that time. She has successfully run her own cattle operation for over ten years by the time she re-consolidated her father's entire homestead. On November 11, 1904, the 40 year-old Duge married the 25 year-old Fred Colter, who had been Bill Phelps' <b>straw</b> <b>boss</b> on Phelps' Apache County operation.|$|E
2500|$|Colter {{worked as}} ranch hand and <b>straw</b> <b>boss</b> {{in the late}} 1890s and early 1900s. On November 11, 1904, {{at the age of}} 25, he married the forty year-old Sarah Dugan Phelps, known as [...] "Duge". Duge had {{inherited}} her father's ranch, the Phelps Ranch, which was renamed after the marriage to Colter Ranch. The two left on a honeymoon trip, from which they returned in early December.|$|E

"I {{am getting}} {{the best kind of}} {{cooperation}} from the men in the shop, practically without exception," [...] replied Jimmy, [...] "although there is one fellow, a <b>straw</b> <b>boss</b> named Krovac, who does not seem to take as kindly to the changes I have made as the others, but he really doesn't amount to anything as an obstacle." [...] Jimmy also thought of Bince and the pay-roll, but he was still afraid to broach the subject. Suddenly an inspiration came to him.|$|E
50|$|The promise was {{short-lived}} though, as failure to qualify next time out in France {{was the final}} <b>straw</b> for Brabham <b>boss</b> Bernie Ecclestone, and Opel was replaced by Carlos Pace. For the second year running he was unclassified in the Driver's Championship with no points. A {{little over a year}} after his debut, the career of Liechtenstein's first - and to date only - Formula One driver was over.|$|R
2500|$|In the {{run up to}} the 2005 general {{election}} Straw faced a potential backlash from his Muslim constituents over the Iraq War – the Muslim Public Affairs Committee UK (MPAC) attempted to capitalise on anti-war sentiment with 'operation Muslim vote' in Blackburn. The swing to the second placed Conservatives was less than 2%, {{much lower than the}} national average; the Liberal Democrat's increase in vote share (+12.5%) surpassed Labour's loss (−12.1%) [...] Craig Murray, who had been withdrawn as the ambassador to Uzbekistan, stood against his former <b>boss</b> (<b>Straw</b> was then Foreign Secretary) on a platform opposing the use of information gathered under torture in the [...] "War on Terror"; he received a 5% vote share. Straw was re-elected, and following his victory called MPAC an [...] "egregious group", and criticised their tactics during the election.|$|R
60|$|Tuesday morning, after {{a severe}} {{questioning}} by the foreman, Carl {{was given a}} week's try-out without pay at the Lodestar factory. He proved {{to be one of}} those much-sought freaks in the world of mechanics, a natural filer. The uninspired filer, unaware of the niceties of the art, saws up and down, whereas the instinctive filer, like Carl, draws his file evenly across the metal, and the result fits its socket truly. So he was given welcome, paid twenty-five cents an hour, and made full member of exactly such a gang as he had known at Plato, after he had laughed away the <b>straw</b> <b>boss</b> who tried to make him go ask for a left-handed monkey-wrench. He roomed at a machinists' boarding-house, and enjoyed the furious discussions over religion and the question of air versus water cooling far more than he had ever enjoyed the polite jesting at Mrs. Henkel's.|$|E
