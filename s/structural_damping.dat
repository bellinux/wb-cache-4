The uncertainties of <b>structural</b> stiffness, <b>damping</b> and mass parameters are assumed to be norm-bounded. The proposed control approach is formulated within the framework of linear matrix inequalities, for which existing convex optimization techniques, such as the LMI toolbox in MATLAB, can be used effectively and conveniently. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust H ∞ strategy, a six-story building was subjected both to the 1940 El Centro earthquake record and to a suddenly applied Kanai-Tajimi filtered white noise random excitation.

5000|$|Interstitial {{condensation}} {{is a form}} of <b>structural</b> <b>damping</b> {{that occurs}} when warm, moist air penetrates inside a wall, roof or floor structure, reaches the dew point and condenses into liquid water. Interstitial condensation is differentiated from surface condensation in buildings sometimes called [...] "cold-bridge condensation" [...] or [...] "warm front condensation" [...] where the condensation forms on the interior or exterior surfaces of a building rather than inside the wall or roof cavities. The warm, damp air may penetrate a wall from the inside of a heated building in a cold climate or from the exterior of an air-conditioned building in a warm climate. This condensation may allow mold growth, rotting of timber, corrosion of metal components and/or a reduction in the thermal insulation's effectiveness. The resulting structural damage may occur without visible indications until significant damage has occurred. Most building materials are permeable so the common method of controlling interstitial condensation is to control indoor moisture at its sources or through dehumidification and/or ventilation and add an impermeable barrier on the warm side of the wall.|$|E

Noise {{can not only}} cause hearing impairment but also act as a causal factor for stress and raise the systolic blood pressure. There are many methods available and being used in industries at present to reduce acoustic emissions from various equipment. The process of reducing sound emissions from equipment is called acoustic quieting. The method of using piezoelectric material to reduce transmitted sound from equipment rather than <b>damping</b> <b>structural</b> vibration can be applied where {{it is difficult to}} <b>damp</b> <b>structural</b> vibrations completely. If piezoelectric materials are attached to vibrating machine parts,withthe supply of suitable voltages, they counter-vibrate which helps in <b>damping</b> <b>structural</b> vibration. Previous studies conducted using simulations with the help of ANSYS software showed noise reductions of up to 20 decibels. This paper presentsan effective technique for tuning the frequencies of vibrations of the piezoelectric material with the source vibrations for the reduction of noise. It can help in cancelling the original vibrations which ultimately lead to the reduction in transmitted noise levels. Experiments reveal that a reduction of 9 decibels innoise level is possible by using a filtercontrol circuit...|$|R

The quasi-steady piston theory of supersonic flow is employed for the aerodynamic pressure. The partial differential governing equation of isotropic flat panel is derived by introducing viscoelastic <b>structural</b> <b>damping</b> based on Kelvin’s model. The panel governing equation {{is transformed into a}} set of ordinary differential equations via the Galerkin approach. First-order state equations are afterwards obtained and solved by means of a standard eigenvalue calculation. The {{dynamic instability}} of viscoelstic panels is predicted by the feature of characteristic roots. The phenomena of coupled-mode flutter without <b>structural</b> <b>damping</b> and single-mode flutter with <b>structural</b> <b>damping</b> induced by the supersonic flow are observed for the different dynamic pressure values.

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} of the present work is to investigate qualitative aspects of mode-coupling instability of self-excited friction-induced oscillations {{in the presence of}} <b>structural</b> <b>damping</b> and a cubic nonlinearity. In a previous study, Sinou and Jezequel demonstrated the effects of <b>structural</b> <b>damping</b> in determining stable and unstable zones and indicated that the damping ratio of the coupling modes may be a key factor for avoiding bad design. In this paper, we propose to complete this study by examining the influence of <b>structural</b> <b>damping</b> on limit cycle amplitudes in order to achieve a complete design including not only the evolution of stable/unstable areas but also the evolution of limit cycle amplitudes as functions of the <b>structural</b> <b>damping</b> and nonlinear system parameter. For the sake of simplicity, a two-degree-of-freedom minimal model is constructed and analysed {{to examine the effects of}} <b>structural</b> <b>damping</b> and cubic nonlinearity on the limit cycles. The nonlinear behaviour and stable limit cycle amplitudes are determined through a Complex Nonlinear Modal Analysis which makes use of the nonlinear unstable mode governing the nonlinear dynamics of structural systems in unstable areas.

40|$|In this study, a Frequency Response Function (FRF) -based model {{updating}} method, {{was modified}} {{for the purpose}} of the identification of viscoelastic constitutive models. A steel beam, bonded to a heavy rigid steel block by a layer of Sikaflex- 252 polyurethane adhesive, was employed as the test setup. Using the concept of Optimum Equivalent Linear FRF (OELF), accelerance FRFs were measured at different random excitation levels which demonstrated the nonlinear behavior of the adhesive. Using a finite element model, the sensitivity analysis showed that the selected FRFs are more sensitive to the storage and loss moduli of the adhesive near the resonances. Therefore, firstly, both of the storage and loss moduli were identified near each resonance separately and the results have been compared with the results based on Inverse Eigen-sensitivity Method (IEM). In continuation, five viscoelastic constitutive models were utilized and identified to characterize the dynamic mechanical properties of the adhesive at different excitation levels. Applying the identified models, the correlation between the FRFs of the FE models and the experimental ones were tested. The results show that amongst the identified models, The Standard Linear Solid (SLS) model in parallel with a viscous or constant <b>structural</b> <b>damper</b> (stiffness proportional) results in better correlation with experiments.

40|$|AbstractAll {{structures}} exhibit {{some form}} of damping, but despite a large literature on the damping, it still {{remains one of the}} least well-understood aspects of general vibration analysis. The synthesis of damping in structural systems and machines is extremely important if a model is to be used in predicting vibration levels, transient responses, transmissibility, decay times or other characteristics in design and analysis that are dominated by energy dissipation. In this paper, new <b>structural</b> <b>damping</b> identification method using normal frequency response functions (NFRFs) which are obtained experimentally is proposed and tested with the objective that the damped finite element model is able to predict the measured FRFs accurately. The proposed <b>structural</b> <b>damping</b> identification is a direct method. In the proposed method, normal FRFs are estimated from the complex FRFs, which are obtained experimentally of the structure. The estimated normal FRFs are subsequently used for identification of general <b>structural</b> <b>damping.</b> The effectiveness of the proposed <b>structural</b> <b>damping</b> identification method is demonstrated by two numerical simulated examples and one real experimental data. Firstly, a study is performed using a lumped mass system. The lumped mass system study is followed by case involving numerical simulation of fixed–fixed beam.
