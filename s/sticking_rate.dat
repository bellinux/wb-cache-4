40|$|We {{study the}} <b>sticking</b> <b>rate</b> of atomic {{hydrogen}} to suspended graphene using four different methods that include contributions from processes with multiphonon emission. We compare the numerical {{results of the}} <b>sticking</b> <b>rate</b> obtained by: (1) the loop expansion of the atom self-energy, (2) the non-crossing approximation (NCA), (3) the independent boson model approximation (IBMA), and (4) a leading-order soft-phonon resummation method (SPR). The loop expansion reveals an infrared problem, analogous to the infamous infrared problem in QED. The 2 -loop contribution to the <b>sticking</b> <b>rate</b> gives a result that tends to diverge for large membranes. The latter three methods remedy this infrared problem and give results that are finite {{in the limit of}} an infinite membrane. We find that for micromembranes (sizes ranging 100 nm to 10 μm), the latter three methods give results that are in good agreement with each other and yield sticking rates that are mildly suppressed relative to the lowest-order golden rule rate. Lastly, we find that the SPR <b>sticking</b> <b>rate</b> decreases slowly to zero with increasing membrane size, while both the NCA and IBMA rates tend to a nonzero constant in this limit. Thus, approximations to the <b>sticking</b> <b>rate</b> can be sensitive to the effects of soft-phonon emission for large membranes. Comment: 18 pages, 7 figure...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{infrared}} dynamics of low-energy atoms interacting {{with a sample}} of suspended graphene at finite temperature. The dynamics exhibits severe infrared divergences order by order in perturbation theory {{as a result of the}} singular nature of low-energy flexural phonon emission. Our model can be viewed as a two-channel generalization of the independent boson model with asymmetric atom-phonon coupling. This allows us to take advantage of the exact non-perturbative solution of the independent boson model in the stronger channel while treating the weaker one perturbatively. In the low-energy limit, the exact solution can be viewed as a resummation (exponentiation) of the most divergent diagrams in the perturbative expansion. As a result of this procedure, we obtain the atom's Green function which we use to calculate the atom damping rate, a quantity equal to the quantum <b>sticking</b> <b>rate.</b> A characteristic feature of our results is that the Green's function retains a weak, infrared cutoff dependence that reflects the reduced dimensionality of the problem. As a consequence, we predict a measurable dependence of the <b>sticking</b> <b>rate</b> on graphene sample size. We provide detailed predictions for the <b>sticking</b> <b>rate</b> of atomic hydrogen as a function of temperature and sample size. The resummation yields an enhanced <b>sticking</b> <b>rate</b> relative to the conventional Fermi golden rule result (equivalent to the one-loop atom self-energy), as higher-order processes increase damping at finite temperature.

A kinetic reaction-diffusion model is developed and applied to the data. We find a very slow <b>sticking</b> <b>rate</b> which, however, when neglected, leads to strongly varying estimates of the free diffusion coefficient.

Triethylarsine (TEAs) {{was used as a}} dopant source. The source materials used were dimethylcadmium (DMCd) and diethyltelluride (DETe). The As incorporation was enhanced by decreasing the DETe flow rate under a fixed DMCd flow condition, and by lowering the growth temperature. Assuming 100 % activation of As, the As incorporation efficiency was estimated to be about 0. 1 %. The As incorporation was dominated by the <b>sticking</b> <b>rate</b> of the As species onto the Cd species.

40|$|The phonon-assisted <b>sticking</b> <b>rate</b> of {{slow moving}} atoms {{impinging}} on an elastic membrane at nonzero temperature is studied analytically using a model with linear atom-phonon interactions, valid in the weak coupling regime. A perturbative {{expansion of the}} adsorption rate in the atom-phonon coupling is infrared divergent at zero temperature, and this infrared problem is exacerbated by finite temperature. The use of a coherent state phonon basis in the calculation, however, yields infrared-finite results even at finite temperature. The sticking probability with the emission of any finite number of phonons is explicitly seen to be exponentially small, and it vanishes as the membrane size grows, a result that was previously found at zero temperature; {{in contrast to the}} zero temperature case, this exponential suppression of the sticking probability persists even with the emission of an infinite number of soft phonons. Explicit closed-form expressions are obtained for the effects of soft-phonon emission at finite temperature on the adsorption rate. For slowly moving atoms, the model predicts that there is zero probability of sticking to a large elastic membrane at nonzero temperature and weak coupling. Comment: 14 pages, 5 figure...|$|E

The control-feel system provided a feel component with individual gain control in proportion to each of five quantities: <b>stick</b> deflection, <b>stick</b> <b>rate,</b> airplane normal acceleration, pitching acceleration, and pitching velocity. A number of feel configurations were investigated in flight and analytically. These feel configurations had feel components in various amounts from various combinations of these five sources. The results contained herein are all for an airplane center-of-gravity position at approximately 25 percent of the mean aerodynamic chord, a Mach number of 0. 85, and an altitude of 28, 000 feet.

40|$|Abstract. We study {{irreversible}} polymer adsorption from dilute solutions theoretically. Universal {{features of}} the resultant non-equilibrium layers are predicted. Two broad cases are considered, distinguished by {{the magnitude of the}} local monomer-surface <b>sticking</b> <b>rate</b> Q: chemisorption (very small Q) and physisorption (large Q). Early stages of layer formation entail single-chain adsorption. While single-chain physisorption times τads are typically micro- to milli-seconds, for chemisorbing chains of N units we find experimentally accessible times τads = Q − 1 N 3 / 5, ranging from seconds to hours. We establish 3 chemisorption universality classes, determined by a critical contact exponent: zipping, accelerated zipping and homogeneous collapse. For dilute solutions, the mechanism is accelerated zipping: zipping propagates outwards from the first attachment, accelerated by occasional formation of large loops which nucleate further zipping. This leads to a transient distribution ω(s) ∼ s− 7 / 5 of loop lengths s up to a maximum size smax ≈ (Qt) 5 / 3 after time t. By times of order τads the entire chain is adsorbed. The outcome of the single-chain adsorption episode is a monolayer of fully collapsed chains. Having only a few vacant sites to adsorb onto, late-arriving chains form a diffuse outer layer. In a simple picture we find for both chemisorption and physisorption a final loop distribution Ω(s) ∼ s− 11 / 5 and density profile c(z) ∼ z− 4 / 3 whose forms are the same as for equilibrium layers. In contrast to equilibrium layers, however, the statistical properties of a given chain depend on its adsorption time; the outer layer contains many classes of chain, each characterized by a different fraction of adsorbed monomers f.

The surface is flexible and is prepared at different temperature values, such as 30 K, 94 K, and 160 K. The adsorbates were distributed randomly on the surface to create 0. 18 ML, 0. 28 ML, and 0. 50 ML of coverages. The multi-layer slab is mimicked by a many-body embedded-atom potential energy function. The slab atoms can move according to the exerted external forces. Treating the slab atoms non-rigid has an important effect on {{the dynamics of the}} projectile atom and adsorbates. Significant energy transfer from the projectile atom to the surface lattice atoms takes place especially during the first impact that modifies significantly the details of the dynamics of the collisions. Effects of the different temperatures of the slab are investigated in this study. Interaction between the surface atoms and the adsorbates is modeled by a modified London–Eyring–Polanyi–Sato (LEPS) function. The LEPS parameters are determined by using the total energy values which were calculated by a density functional theory and a generalized gradient approximation for an exchange-correlation energy for many different orientations, and locations of one- and two-hydrogen atoms on the Cu(111) surface. The rms value of the fitting procedure is about 0. 16 eV. Many different channels of the processes on the surface have been examined, such as inelastic reflection of the incident hydrogen, subsurface penetration of the incident projectile and adsorbates, sticking of the incident atom on the surface. In addition, hot-atom and Eley-Rideal direct processes are investigated. The hot-atom process is found to be more significant than the Eley-Rideal process.

Still, the impacts of irrigation schemes on the functioning of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are poorly understood. Here we assess the effects of irrigation agriculture on breakdown of coarse organic matter in soil and water. We measured breakdown rates of alder and holm oak leaves, and of poplar sticks in terrestrial and aquatic sites following a gradient of increasing irrigation agriculture in a semi-arid Mediterranean basin transformed into irrigation agriculture in 50 % of its surface. Spatial patterns of stick breakdown paralleled those of leaf breakdown. In soil, <b>stick</b> breakdown <b>rates</b> were extremely low in non-irrigated sites (0. 0001 - 0. 0003 day- 1), and increased with the intensity of agriculture (0. 0018 - 0. 0044 day- 1).

He feared the corruption caused by railroad monopolies and considered their control a moral challenge. As chairman of the TRC, he changed his views when he became acquainted with the realities of the complex forces affecting railroad management. Reagan turned to the Efficiency Movement for ideas, establishing a pattern of regulatory practice that TRC used for decades. He believed that the agency should pursue two main goals: to protect consumers from unfair railway practices and excessive rates, and to support the state's overall economic growth. To find the optimal rates that met these goals he focused the TRC on the collection of data, direct negotiation with railway executives, and compromises with the parties involved. The agency did not have the legal authority to set rates, nor did it have the resources to spend much of its time in court battles. The carrot was far more important than the <b>stick.</b> Freight <b>rates</b> continued to decline dramatically. In 1891, a typical rate was 1.403 cents per ton mile. By 1907 the rate was 1.039 cents - a decline of 25%. However the railroads did not have rates high enough for them to upgrade their equipment and lower costs in the face of competition from pipelines, cars and trucks, and the Texas railway system began a slow decline.|$|R
40|$|Detonation {{velocity}} and wave shape are measured for PBX 9502 (95 wt. % TATB, 5 wt. % Kel-F 800) <b>rate</b> <b>sticks</b> at the temperatures {minus} 55, 25, and 75 C. At each temperature three different diameters were fired: 50 mm, 18 mm, and 8, 10, and 12 mm respectively for the hot, ambient, and cold sticks. The measured wave shapes are fit with an analytic {{form and the}} fitting parameters are tabulated along with thermal expansion and diameter effect data. The simplest detonation shock dynamics (DSD) model assumes a unique calibration function relating the local normal wave speed D{sub n} to the local total curvature {kappa}. The data confirm this notion for sufficiently small curvature, but at large curvature the curves for different charge diameters diverge. Global optimization is used to determine a best single D{sub n}-{kappa} function at each initial temperature T{sub 0 }. From these curves a D{sub n}({kappa},T{sub 0 }) calibration surface is generated that allows computation of problems with temperature gradients...|$|R
40|$|Reserve {{attention}} {{capacity of}} a pilot was calculated using a pilot model that allocates exclusive model attention according to the ranking of task urgency functions whose variables are tracking error and error rate. The modeled task consisted of tracking a maneuvering target aircraft both vertically and horizontally, and when possible, performing a diverting side task which was simulated by the precise positioning of an electrical stylus and modeled as a task of constant urgency in the attention allocation algorithm. The urgency of the single loop vertical task is simply {{the magnitude of the}} vertical tracking error, while the multiloop horizontal task requires a nonlinear urgency measure of error and error rate terms. Comparison of model results with flight simulation data verified the computed model statistics of tracking error of both axes, lateral and longitudinal <b>stick</b> amplitude and <b>rate,</b> and side task episodes. Full data for the simulation tracking statistics as well as the explicit equations and structure of the urgency function multiaxis pilot model are presented...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Investigation {{the effect}} of varying r. f. power and oxygen flow rates during {{deposition}} on the electrical properties of copper oxide thin films prepared by reactive magnetron sputteringDesign/methodology/approach: The films were characterised by AFM, XPS, four point electrical resistivity probe measurements and spectrophotometry. Findings: The electrical sheet resistance of the films was found to vary from greater than 4 x 105 ohms/square for films prepared at 200 W r. f. power to as low as 20 ohms/square for films prepared at 800 W r. f. power. The variation in the electrical resistivity of the films with deposition conditions has been {{explained in terms of}} stoichiometric changes induced by copper or oxygen ion vacancies and neutral defects. Practical implications: The formation of these defects depends on the <b>sticking</b> coefficient, nucleation <b>rates</b> and the migration of impinging copper and oxygen species on the substrate during deposition. Originality/value: This information is expected to underlie the successful development of copper oxide films for solar windows and other semi-conductor applications including gas sensors...|$|R
40|$|Diameter {{effect and}} front {{curvature}} measurements are reported for <b>rate</b> <b>stick</b> experiments on commercially available prilled ANFO (ammonium-nitrate/fuel-oil) at ambient temperature. The {{shots were fired}} in paper tubes so as to provide minimal confinement. Diameters ranged from 77 mm ({approx} failure diameter) to 205 mm, with the tube length being ten diameters in all cases. Each detonation wave shape was fit with an analytic form, from which the local normal velocity Dn, and local total curvature {kappa}, were generated {{as a function of}} radius R, then plotted parametrically to generate a Dn({kappa}) function. The observed behavior deviates substantially from that of previous explosives, for which curves for different diameters overlay well for small {kappa} but diverge for large {kappa}, and for which {kappa} increases monotonically with R. For ANFO, we find that Dn({kappa}) curves for individual sticks (1) show little or no overlap [...] with smaller sticks lying to the right of larger ones, (2) exhibit a large velocity deficit with little {kappa} variation, and (3) reach a peak {kappa} at an intermediate R...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{is to improve the}} robustness and accuracy of numerical simulations of both ideal and non-ideal explosives by introducing temperature dependence in mechanical equations of state for reactants and products. To this end, we modify existing mechanical equations of state to appropriately approximate the temperature in the reaction zone. Mechanical equations of state of Mie-Grüneisen form are developed with extensions, which allow the temperature to be evaluated appropriately, and the temperature equilibrium condition to be applied robustly. Furthermore the snow plow model is used to capture the effect of porosity on the reactants equation of state. We apply the methodology to predict the velocity of compliantly confined detonation waves. Once reaction rates are calibrated for unconfined detonation velocities, simulations of confined <b>rate</b> <b>sticks</b> and slabs are performed, and the experimental detonation velocities are matched without further parameter alteration, demonstrating the predictive capability of our simulations. We apply the same methodology to both ideal (PBX 9502, a high explosive with principal ingredient TATB) and non-ideal (EM 120 D, an ANE or ammonium nitrate based emulsion) explosives...|$|R
