5|$|Canada golden-rod (<b>Solidago</b> canadensis) {{appeared}} in 2003 {{as a result}} of plant deposits. The threat proved to be serious the following year. Some stations show a significant concentration of the species, while isolated plants grow everywhere on the site. This plant is easily pulled by hand before flowering to prevent seed dispersal, and the shoots are burned.|$|E
25|$|After testing 17,000 plant samples, Edison {{eventually}} {{discovered a}} {{source in the}} plant Goldenrod (<b>Solidago</b> leavenworthii). Thomas Edison died in 1931. The rubber project {{was transferred to the}} United States Department of Agriculture five years later.|$|E
25|$|The spit {{received}} {{its name from}} the seaside goldenrod (<b>Solidago</b> sempervirens), a small yellow flowering plant, that is common to the fajã. This species, common along the eastern coast of the United States, spread throughout many of the islands of the archipelago.|$|E
25|$|Common {{dominant}} trees {{utilized by}} Indiana bat throughout its range include oaks (Quercus spp.), hickories (Carya spp.), ashes (Fraxinus spp.), elms (Ulmus spp.), eastern cottonwoods (Populus deltoides), locusts (Robinia spp.), and maples (Acer spp.). The understory may include hawthorns (Crataegus spp.), dogwoods (Cornus spp.), fragrant sumac (Rhus aromatica), giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida), sedges (Carex spp.), Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia), wood nettle (Laportea canadensis), goldenrod (<b>Solidago</b> spp.), poison-ivy (Toxicodendron radicans), and wild grape (Vitis spp.).|$|E
25|$|These spiders may be {{yellow or}} white, {{depending}} on the flower {{in which they are}} hunting. Especially younger females, which may hunt on a variety of flowers such as daisies and sunflowers, may change color at will. Older females require large amounts of relatively large prey to produce the best possible clutch of eggs. They are therefore, in North America, most commonly found in goldenrod (<b>Solidago</b> sp.), a bright yellow flower which attracts large numbers of insects, especially in autumn. It is often very hard even for a searching human to recognize one of these spiders on a yellow flower. These spiders are sometimes called banana spiders because of their striking yellow color.|$|E
25|$|Edison's work on rubber {{took place}} largely at his botanic {{research}} laboratory in Fort Myers, {{which has been}} designated as a National Historic Chemical Landmark. The laboratory was built after Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Harvey Firestone pulled together $75,000 to form the Edison Botanical Research Corporation. Initially, only Ford and Firestone were to contribute funds to the project while Edison did all the research. Edison, however, wished to contribute $25,000 as well. After testing over 17,000 plant species, Edison decided on <b>Solidago</b> leavenworthii, also known as Leavenworth's Goldenrod. The plant, which normally grows roughly 3–4 feet tall with a 5% latex yield, was adapted by Edison through cross-breeding to produce plants twice the size and with a latex yield of 12%.|$|E
500|$|After {{his return}} to London in 1946, {{at the end of}} the Second World War, a number of major {{publications}} ensued, including Lilies of the World in 1950. The RHS also imposed two major tasks on their librarian. In 1950, Frederick Chittenden, a previous director of RHS Wisley and Keeper of the Library, died leaving unfinished the four volume RHS Dictionary of Gardening that the Society had commissioned from him before the war. The war had interrupted the work as many of the expected contributors were unavailable. Stearn, together with Patrick Synge, the RHS Publications Editor, undertook to complete the work, particularly volume IV (R–Z), a task he completed within six months, with 50 new articles. The finished work was published in 1951 and not only did he undertake the role of editing this large work but his contributions covered 50 genera, 600 species and complex identification keys such as <b>Solidago</b> and Viola. Since Stearn's entries in volume IV extended from Soldanella to Zygotritonia, he would jest that he was but [...] "a peculiar authority on plants from 'So-' onwards". He issued a revised version in 1956 with Synge in which he added a further 86 articles. His recollection of this task was that he acquired [...] "that occupational hazard of compilers of encyclopaedias", encyclopaedic knowledge.|$|E

60|$|The plants which I noticed {{here and}} there on the pure sandy shelf, between the {{ordinary}} high-water mark and {{the foot of the}} bank, were Sea Rocket (Cakile Americana), Saltwort (Salsola kali), Sea Sandwort (Honkenya peploides), Sea Burdock (Xanthium echinatum), Sea-side Spurge (Euphorbia poylgonifolia); also, Beach Grass (Arundo, Psamma, or Calamagrostis arenaria), Sea-side Golden-rod (<b>Solidago</b> sempervirens), and the Beach Pea (Lathyrus maritimus).|$|E

Some {{say that he was}} a Guinea Negro. There are a few who remember his little patch among the walnuts, which he let grow up till he should be old and need them; but a younger and whiter speculator got them at last. He too, however, occupies an equally narrow house at present. Cato's half-obliterated cellar-hole still remains, though known to few, being concealed from the traveller by a fringe of pines. It is now filled with the smooth sumach (Rhus glabra), and one of the earliest species of goldenrod (<b>Solidago</b> stricta) grows there luxuriantly.|$|E
5000|$|The larvae feed on Baccharis pilularis and <b>Solidago</b> species, {{including}} <b>Solidago</b> altissima, <b>Solidago</b> bicolor, <b>Solidago</b> caesia, <b>Solidago</b> canadensis, <b>Solidago</b> fistulosa, <b>Solidago</b> gigantea, <b>Solidago</b> patula and <b>Solidago</b> rugosa. They {{mine the}} leaves of their host plant by digging an elongated, wrinkled [...] "mine" [...] {{on the underside of}} the leaf. Pupation takes place within a dense white cocoon, marked with longitudinal ridges. It is suspended hammock-like within the mine, by a single silken thread at the anterior end and by two diverging threads at the posterior end. When the imago emerges the pupa case is thrust through the upper epidermis.|$|E

5000|$|Shortolide A is {{a natural}} product {{isolated}} from <b>Solidago</b> shortii. [...] S. shortii is an endangered species native to the United States. Shortolide A is one of six diterpenes isolated from the species <b>Solidago</b> shortii. Three of these products are hydrolysis products. <b>Solidago</b> is common across North America but <b>Solidago</b> shortii is only found in a limited area where only 14 wild populations are known. Because of this, the species was designated as endangered.|$|E
50|$|One {{hypothesis}} {{about the}} origin of the garden plant x Solidaster is that it was an intergeneric hybrid between Oligoneuron album and Euthamia graminifolia. However, molecular evidence points to Oligoneuron album being more accurately placed in <b>Solidago</b> (as <b>Solidago</b> ptarmicoides), and the other parent as being <b>Solidago</b> canadensis.|$|E
50|$|The type {{collection}} {{was made by}} E. S. Steele in 1909, Vicinity of Kilbourn, on the Wisconsin River. Reports of <b>Solidago</b> sciaphila from North Carolina are <b>Solidago</b> villosicarpa instead (LeBlond, 2000).|$|E
5000|$|Within <b>Solidago,</b> S. altissima {{is part of}} the <b>Solidago</b> canadensis species complex, {{which is}} {{classified}} in the subsection Triplinervae. [...] S. altissima has sometimes been classified as part of S. canadensis.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} cultivars have been selected, {{including}} several of hybrid origin. A putative hybrid with aster, known as ×Solidaster is less unruly, with pale yellow flowers, equally suitable for dried arrangements. Molecular and other {{evidence points to}} ×Solidaster (at least the cultivar 'Lemore') being a hybrid of <b>Solidago</b> ptarmicoides and <b>Solidago</b> canadensis, the former now in <b>Solidago,</b> but likely the [...] "aster" [...] in question.|$|E
