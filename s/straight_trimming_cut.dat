First, the influence of discharge energy (DE) in rough cut is evaluated for machining rate (MR) and surface roughness (SR) and compared with <b>trim</b> <b>cut</b> without any metal powder additives in dielectric fluid. The effect of Al and Si metal powders (varying concentration of 1 g/L, 2 g/L and 3 g/L) in dielectric fluid is studied separately and comparison is also made for MR, SR, recast layer and micro hardness of machined Nimonic- 90.

40|$|AbstractSuperalloys such as Inconel 718 {{are widely}} used in {{turbomachinery}} industry due to their outstanding mechanical properties. Inconel alloys {{are very difficult to}} machine using conventional mechanical processes like broaching, milling or grinding. Wire electrical discharge machining (W-EDM) is an alternative competitive process to manufacture complex Inconel part geometries. However, surface integrity of W-EDMed Inconel components is poorly understood. This study presents the characteristics of surface integrity vs. discharge energy in W-EDM of Inconel 718. The results show that the EDMed surface topography shows dominant coral reef microstructures at high discharge energy, while random micro voids are dominant at low discharge energy. Surface roughness is equivalent for parallel and perpendicular wire directions, and average roughness can be significantly reduced for low discharge energy. The thick white layers are predominantly discontinuous and non-uniform at relative high discharge energy. Micro voids are confined within the thick white layers and no micro cracks were found in the subsurface. The thin white layers by <b>trim</b> <b>cut</b> at low discharge energy become more continuous, uniform, and are free of micro voids. Compared to the bulk material, white layers have dramatic reduction in microhardness due to significant thermal degradation. In addition, surface alloying from wire electrode and water dielectric are obvious in main cut at high discharge energy, but it can be minimized in <b>trim</b> <b>cuts</b> at very low discharge energy...|$|R

40|$|Wire {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} (WEDM) is well known process for generating intricate and complex profiles in hard metal matrix composites. But damaged surface layer with poor surface integrity is a major disadvantage of WEDM. Beside poor damaged surface layer, after rough/first cut in WEDM, some surface area remains unmachined on work surface during intricate machining such as in die cutting. This paper presents a study on unmachined surface area named as surface projection, in die cutting after rough cut in WEDM. Using scanning electron microscope images, length of unmachined surface projections have been determined. In order to minimize these surface projections from small cavities having complex geometries, trim cutting operation is the best alternative.
