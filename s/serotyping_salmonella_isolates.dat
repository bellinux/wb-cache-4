40|$|Salmonella enterica {{is highly}} {{polymorphic}} for the O antigen, a surface polysaccharide that {{is subject to}} intense selection by the host immune system. This polymorphism is used for <b>serotyping</b> <b>Salmonella</b> <b>isolates.</b> The genes encoding O antigen biosynthesis {{are located in the}} rfb gene cluster. We report here the cloning and sequence of the 19 -kb rfb region from strain M 32 (serovar anatum, group E 1) and compare it with that of strain LT 2 (serovar typhimurium, group B). Genes for biosynthetic pathways common to both strains are conserved and have very similar sequences. In contrast, the five genes for CDP-abequose synthesis, present in strain LT 2, are absent in strain M 32; three open reading frames (ORFs) of strain LT 2, thought to include genes for transferases, are not present in strain M 32 but are replaced by three different ORFs with little or low level of similarity. Both rfb gene clusters are low in G + C content, indicating that they were transferred from a common ancestral species with low G + C content to S. enterica relatively recently (in the evolutionary sense). We discuss the recombination and lateral transfer events which may {{have been involved in the}} evolution of the polymorphism...|$|E
30|$|Flagella confer {{motility}} to Salmonella {{and have}} been employed {{as one of the}} main antigenic determinants used for <b>serotyping</b> <b>Salmonella</b> <b>isolates.</b> The external body of the flagellum is mainly constituted by an homopolymer of flagellin, organized in an helicoidal distribution, presenting an exposed central domain that is highly variable among the different serovars and conserved N and C-terminal regions that are responsible for the polymerization of flagellin to form the flagellum (Ramos et al. 2004). The variability of the central domain of flagellin is reflected in the high number of serovars described for the Salmonella genus. Traditionally, serotyping was conducted using polyclonal antisera that were generated by inoculation with the desired strain and adsorbed with a set of related strains to increase the specificity of the resulting antiserum (Gray et al. 1974). In the case of H antigen, preparation of specific antiserum was facilitated by the use of purified flagellin for immunization (Ibrahim et al. 1985 a), although the presence of conserved regions in the molecule among different serovars originated possible cross-reactions depending on the procedure used for antiserum generation (Ibrahim et al. 1985 b). Upon the widespread use of techniques for monoclonal antibody (MAb) generation, several MAbs for strain serotyping have been described (Sojka et al. 2001; de Vries et al. 1998; Rementeria et al. 2009; Iankov et al. 2002). The availability of strain-specific MAbs for serotyping provides many advantages, such as using a molecularly defined homogeneous reagent that can be produced in high scale and basically without restrictions of quantity (Nelson et al. 2000).|$|E
30|$|As mentioned, {{agglutination}} {{tests are}} routinely used in diagnostic laboratories to <b>serotype</b> <b>Salmonella</b> <b>isolates.</b> Usually, incubation of a bacterial suspension with an adequate dilution {{of a specific}} antibody generates a network of antibodies linked {{to the surface of}} different bacteria, which are responsible for the agglutination reaction. Using a set of different <b>Salmonella</b> <b>isolates,</b> previously characterized using standard serological techniques at the NSC and routinely used as reference strains for serotype determinations, we further evaluated the agglutination capacity of MAbs 5 B 4 H 2, 2 B 3 H 10 and 2 D 11 A 1.|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the incidence of Salmonella and Shigella spp. in blood and stool samples of patients. A total of 150, samples of blood (110) and stool (40) were collected from patients, reporting at NIH (National Institute Health) and six Salmonella and two Shigella strains were identified by colony identification and biochemical tests and serotyping. Of the 6 Salmonella isolates; 2 were of S. typhi, 1 of S. paratyphi A, 1 of S. paratyphi B and 2 of other Salmonella spp. The 2 Shigella strains from stool samples were S. flexneri (Poly B <b>serotype).</b> <b>Salmonella</b> <b>isolates</b> were found to be susceptible to gentamicin, ofloxacin, cefotaxime, amikacin, tobramycin, cefaclor, while resistant to ampicillin, cefamendole, chloramphenicol, gentamicin and cefuroxime. Shigella strains showed resistance to vibramycin, ampicillin, tetracycline and sensitivity against nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, chloramphenicol, amikacin, and aztreonam. Despite the fact that the overall prevalence of Salmonella and Shigella reported in this study was low, there is sufficient evidences to indicate that better hygiene and water treatment and management would even further reduce the incidence of these infections...|$|R

40|$|Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar {{identification}} {{is of great}} importance with respect to outbreak monitoring and case verification. Therefore rapid, sensitive and cost efficient detection of Salmonella spp. is indispensable within microbiology labs. To amalgamate single tube <b>isolate</b> identification with <b>Salmonella</b> typing, we developed the high-throughput Universal Probe <b>Salmonella</b> <b>Serotyping</b> (UPSS) technique based on nano liter PCR. In comparison to the classical approach, where O- and H-antisera are applied, the UPSS relies on specific gene content amplification of Salmonella spp. by a universal TaqMan assay for all markers and identification of the specific amplicon pattern. To enable high-throughput technology we employed a chip format containing 1024 wells loaded by an automated liquid-handling system which allowed us to perform TaqMan PCR reactions in volumes of 100 nL per well. Herein we present proof of principle of the UPSS method {{by the use of}} a test panel of 100 previously <b>serotyped</b> <b>Salmonella</b> <b>isolates</b> to successfully verify the usability, accuracy and feasibility of the newly developed UPSS approach. We found that the methodology of the UPSS technology is capable of unequivocally identifying 30 <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes</b> on a single chip within 3 hours but can be highly parallelized by the use of multiple PCR machines. Therefore the UPSS method offers a robust and straightforward molecular alternative for Salmonella detection and typing that saves expensive chemistry and can be easily automated...|$|R
40|$|The waste {{treatment}} facilities and final effluents of 11 meat-packing {{plants in the}} Province of Alberta were investigated primarily to determine the numbers of indicator bacteria {{and the presence of}} Salmonella. This was done to discover the efficiency of the treatment systems presently in operation in reducing bacterial numbers and to establish the need for disinfection and for bacterial standards for these effluents. Data obtained showed that the final effluents were of very poor quality bacteriologically, with numbers of indicator organisms comparable to those found in raw sewage. Primary treatment facilities were ineffective in reducing the numbers of these bacteria. The secondary treatment facility investigated achieved greater than a 99 % reduction of indicator bacteria. <b>Salmonella</b> were <b>isolated</b> from the final effluents of 78 % of the plants, including the plant using secondary treatment.

Resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins is associated with clinical failures, including death, in patients with systemic infections. In this study, 87 <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Newport strains were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing and examined {{for the presence of}} class 1 integrons and blaCMY genes. Thirty-five PFGE patterns were observed with XbaI, and three of these patterns were indistinguishable among isolates from humans and animals. Fifty-three (60 %) <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Newport <b>isolates</b> were identified as serotype Newport MDR-AmpC, including 16 (53 %) of 30 human isolates, 27 (93 %) of 29 cattle isolates, 7 (70 %) of 10 swine isolates, and 3 (30 %) of 10 chicken isolates. However, 28 (32 %) <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Newport <b>isolates</b> were susceptible to all 16 antimicrobials tested. The blaCMY gene was present in all serotype Newport MDR-AmpC isolates. Furthermore, the plasmid-mediated blaCMY gene was transferable via conjugation to an Escherichia coli strain. The transconjugant showed the MDR-AmpC resistance profile. Thirty-five (40 %) of the isolates possessed class 1 integrons. Sequence analyses of the integrons showed that they contained aadA, which confers resistance to streptomycin, or aadA and dhfr, which confer resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. One integron from a swine isolate contained the sat- 1 gene, which encodes resistance to streptothricin, an antimicrobial agent that has never been approved for use in the United States.

Typhimurium; S. dublin and S. infantis, showed low to moderate resistance profiles to most antimicrobial drugs. Nalidixic acid and tetracycline were the most and the least effective drugs, respectively, in the disk diffusion tests.

40|$|Aims] To {{establish}} a typing {{method for tracing}} the epidemic relationship of 16 strains of <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Havana <b>isolated</b> from captive raptors showing no symptomatology and residing in a wildlife hospital in Spain. [Methods and Results] Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, ribotyping, pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) methodology were applied. Ten unrelated strains of serotype Havana were included as a control group to provide a basis of for {{the efficiency of the}} different markers used. All outbreak-related strains were resistant to nalidixic acid and streptomycin and showed the same ripotype, pulsotype and AFLP pattern. [Conclusions] This {{is the first time that}} AFLP analysis has been tested with serotype Havana isolates and it has demonstrated to be the most useful epidemiological tool for discriminating between unrelated and outbreak-related strains of this serotype. The results obtained suggest that all the <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Havana <b>isolates</b> represented a common outbreak strain whose origin of contamination could not be established although it is thought that it was the poultry meat used for raptors'diet. [Significance and Impact of the Study] Our study suggests the importance of microbiological analysis of these products in order to prevent contamination and dissemination of Salmonellae in this kind of Hospital. This work has been supported by the grant 13 / 99 of the Universidad San Pablo CEU. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{our survey}} {{was to assess}} the effect of {{irrigation}} water of the microbiological quality on the production chain of lettuce in the Dakar area. Microbiological analysis showed that 35 % of irrigation water was contaminated by Salmonella spp. between the two water-types used for irrigation (groundwater and wastewater), no significant difference (p> 0. 05) in their degree of contamination was found. The incidence of different types of irrigation water on the contamination rate of lettuces from the farm (Pikine and Patte d'Oie) was not different either (p> 0. 05). However, the contamination rate of lettuce from markets of Dalifort and Grand-Yoff that were supplied by the area of Patte d'Oie was greater than those of Sham and Zinc supplied by Pikine (p< 0. 05). Comparison of <b>serotypes</b> of <b>Salmonella</b> <b>isolated</b> from irrigation water and lettuce showed that irrigation water may affect the microbiological quality of lettuce. Manures, frequently used as organic amendment in cultivating lettuce are another potential source of contamination. These results showed that lettuce may constitute effective vectors for the transmission of pathogens to consumers. Extensive treatment of the used wastewater and/or composting of manure could considerably reduce these risks...|$|R
40|$|Three {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to investigate the use of molecular techniques to identify <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes</b> in poultry. In the first experiment, two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based techniques: {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE) and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) were used to analyze <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> <b>isolates</b> from two turkey processing plants (A and B). Genotypic patterns of each isolate were compared with those of known serotypes identified by traditional antibody precipitation methods. In Plant A, four different <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes</b> were identified: Derby, Hadar, Montevideo, and Senftenberg. In plant B, ten serotypes were identified: Agona, Anatum, Brandenburg, Derby, Hadar, Meleagridis, Montevideo, Reading, Senftenberg, and Typhimurium. S. Derby was predominant in Plant A (83 %) while S. Typhimurium was the most common serotype recovered in Plant B (39 %). Overall, DGGE was more sensitive than PAGE. Isolates of the same serotypes were all grouped together by DGGE, while PAGE failed to group all like serotypes. Next, DGGE and REP-PCR were used as genotyping tools for identifying <b>Salmonella.</b> Fifty-four <b>Salmonella</b> <b>isolates</b> from two turkey processing plants (A and B) were evaluated. The isolates were comprised of the following serotypes: Brandenburg, Derby, Hadar, and Typhimurium (n = 6, 21, 12, and 15, respectively). Both methods were very sensitive and detected diverse fingerprint profiles among the isolates. The data suggested that REP-PCR and DGGE are useful tools for identifying <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes</b> in research trials of this type. The final trial was carried out to track <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes</b> throughout an integrated poultry operation using DGGE. Four flocks were sampled from grow-out through processing. The data showed that there was correlation between <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes</b> found on processed carcasses and during grow-out. In addition, the isolates were compared against 15 known serotypes in our data base and only S. Hadar from the data base matched the unknown <b>Salmonella</b> <b>isolates.</b> Overall, these studies demonstrate that PCR-based methods could be considered as an alternative to conventional methods of antibody-based serotyping. Molecular methods were found to be reliable, sensitive, inexpensive, reproducible, and less labor intensive than conventional methods...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLittle {{is known}} about the risk of Salmonella {{infection}} in outdoor pig production, but seroprevalence data have indicated a higher incidence of Salmonella in outdoor than in conventional indoor production systems. This higher incidence may be due to an increased exposure of the animals to the surrounding environment, including contact with wildlife. In a study on the transmission of Salmonella to outdoor pigs an unexpected high diversity of <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes</b> that are not normally isolated from pigs, like for instance S. Uganda and S. Goldcoast, was detected in faecal and in soil and water samples. However, in a small-scale wildlife survey to elucidate the potential source of the different <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes,</b> the bacterium was not detected in any of a total of 22 rats, mice and shrews nor in 22 birds (mainly crow-birds; Corvidae). The unidentified source of the <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes</b> <b>isolated</b> implies inadequate control possibilities and may therefore pose a problem to outdoor pig production in terms of food safety...|$|R
40|$|Patients with {{typhoid fever}} due to <b>Salmonella</b> enterica <b>serotype</b> Typhi strains for which fluoroquinolones MICs are {{elevated}} yet that {{are classified as}} susceptible by the current interpretive criteria of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute may not respond adequately to fluoroquinolone therapy. Patients from seven U. S. states with invasive <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Typhi infection between 1999 and 2002 were enrolled in a multicenter retrospective cohort study. Patients infected with <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Typhi <b>isolates</b> with ciprofloxacin MICs of 0. 12 to 1 μg/ml (decreased ciprofloxacin susceptibility but not resistant to ciprofloxacin [DCS]) were compared with patients infected with isolates with ciprofloxacin MICs < 0. 12 μg/ml for fever clearance time and treatment failure. Of 71 patients, 30 (43 %) were female and 24 (34 %) were infected with <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Typhi with DCS; the median age was 14 years (range, 1 to 51 years). Twenty-one (88 %) of 24 isolates with DCS were resistant to nalidixic acid. The median antimicrobial-related fever clearance times in the DCS and non-DCS groups were 92 h (range, 21 to 373 h) and 72 h (range, 19 to 264 h) (P = 0. 010), respectively, and the fluoroquinolone-related fever clearance times in the DCS and non-DCS groups were 90 h (range, 9 to 373 h) and 64 h (range, 34 to 204 h) (P = 0. 153), respectively. Four (17 %) of 24 patients in the DCS group and 2 (4 %) of 46 patients in the non-DCS group (relative risk, 2. 5; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 2 to 5. 1) experienced treatment failure. Associations persisted after adjustment for potential confounders. We demonstrate that patients infected with <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Typhi <b>isolates</b> with DCS show evidence of a longer time to fever clearance and more frequent treatment failure. Nalidixic acid screening does not detect all isolates with DCS...|$|R
40|$|Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) {{cause the}} {{majority}} of bloodstream infections in sub-Saharan Africa; however, serotyping is rarely performed. We validated a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay with the White-Kauffmann-Le Minor (WKLM) scheme of <b>serotyping</b> using 110 <b>Salmonella</b> <b>isolates</b> from blood cultures of febrile children in Ghana and applied the method in other Typhoid Fever Surveillance in Africa Program study sites. In Ghana, 47 (43 %) S.
