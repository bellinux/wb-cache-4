And then, turning to the two girls in the boat with him, he continued gaily: [...] "Now sit {{right in the center}} of the boat, please; and be <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> hair parted exactly in the middle;" [...] and at this both girls shrieked with laughter.|$|E
6000|$|My dear Taylor--This morning I {{received}} yours of the 2d, {{and with}} it a letter from Hessey enclosing a Bank post Bill of £30, an ample sum I assure you--more I had no thought of.--You should not have delayed so long in Fleet St.--leading an inactive life as you did was breathing poison: {{you will find the}} country air do more for you than you expect. But it must be proper country air. You must choose a spot. What sort of a place is Retford? You should have a dry, gravelly, barren, elevated country, open to the currents of air, and such a place is generally furnished with the finest springs--The neighbourhood of a rich enclosed fulsome manured arable land, especially in a valley and almost as bad on a flat, would be almost as bad as the smoke of Fleet St.--Such a place as this was Shanklin, only open to the south-east, and surrounded by hills in every other direction. From this south-east came the damps of the sea; which, having no egress, the air would for days together take on an unhealthy idiosyncrasy altogether enervating and weakening as a city smoke--I felt it very much. Since I have been here at Winchester I have been improving in health--it is not so confined--and there is {{on one side of the}} City a dry chalky down, where the air is worth Sixpence a pint. So if you do not get better at Retford, do not impute it to your own weakness before you have well considered the Nature of the air and soil--especially as Autumn is encroaching--for the Autumn fog over a rich land is like the steam from cabbage water. What makes the great difference between valesmen, flatlandmen and mountaineers? The cultivation of the earth in a great measure--Our health temperament and disposition are taken more (notwithstanding the contradiction of the history of Cain and Abel) from the air we breathe, than is generally imagined. See the difference between a Peasant and a Butcher.--I am convinced a great cause of it is the difference of the air they breathe: the one takes his mingled with the fume of slaughter, the other from the dank exhalement from the glebe; the teeming damp that comes up from the plough-furrow is of great effect in taming the fierceness of a strong man--more than his labour--Let him be mowing furze upon a mountain, and at the day's end his thoughts will run upon a..axe[104] if he ever had handled one; let him leave the plough, and he will think quietly of his supper. Agriculture is the tamer of men--the steam from the earth is like drinking their Mother's milk--it enervates their nature--this appears a great cause of the imbecility of the Chinese: and if this sort of atmosphere is a mitigation to the energy of a strong man, how much more must it injure a weak one unoccupied unexercised--For what is the cause of so many men maintaining a good state in Cities, but occupation--An idle man, a man who is not sensitively alive to self-interest in a city cannot continue long in good health. This is easily explained--If you were to walk leisurely through an unwholesome path in the fens, with a little horror of them, you would be <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> ague. But let Macbeth cross the same path, with the dagger in the air leading him on, and he would never have an ague or anything like it--You should give these things a serious consideration. Notts, I believe, is a flat county--You should be on the slope of one of the dry barren hills in Somersetshire. I am convinced there is as harmful air to be breathed in the country as in town. I am greatly obliged to you for your letter. Perhaps, if you had had strength and spirits enough, you would have felt offended by my offering a note of hand, or rather expressed it. However, I am sure you will give me credit for not in anywise mistrusting you: or imagining that you would take advantage of any power I might give you over me. No--It proceeded from my serious resolve not to be a gratuitous borrower, from a great desire to be correct in money matters, to have in my desk the Chronicles of them to refer to, and know my worldly non-estate: besides in case of my death such documents would be but just, if merely as memorials of the friendly turns I had done to me--Had I known of your illness I should not have written in such fiery phrase in my first letter. I hope that shortly you will be able to bear six times as much. Brown likes the tragedy very much: But he is not a fit judge of it, as I have only acted as midwife to his plot; and of course he will be fond of his child. I do not think I can make you any extracts without spoiling the effect of the whole when you come to read it--I hope you will then not think my labour mis-spent. Since I finished it, I have finished Lamia, and am now occupied in revising St. Agnes's Eve, and studying Italian. Ariosto I find as diffuse, in parts, as Spenser--I understand completely the difference between them. I will cross the letter with some lines from Lamia. Brown's kindest remembrances to you--and I am ever your most sincere friend ...|$|E

[...] Ashley Cooke of Roughstock gave the song {{three and a half}} stars out of five, saying that [...] "it's a catchy tune that’s <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> you bobbing <b>your</b> head" [...] and [...] "Pardi blends a traditional country sound with an up-tempo beat." ...|$|R

The family includes Hans and his wife Carola, their energetic son Johanne, and their shy little daughter Angelika. Gertie the Goose is also often spotted with the family along with the three moral mushrooms, Max, Morrit, and Meta. It is said that to see a gnome would bring you good luck for the year to come.|$|E
40|$|Oracle Auto Service Request (ASR) is a secure, scalable, customer-installable {{software}} feature of warranty and Oracle Support Services that provides auto-case generation when common hardware component faults occur. ASR {{is designed to}} enable faster problem resolution by eliminating the need to initiate contact with Oracle Support Services for common hardware component failures, reducing both the number of phone calls needed and overall phone time required. ASR also simplifies support operations by using electronic diagnostic data. Easily installed and deployed, ASR is completely controlled by you, the customer, to ensure security. ASR is applicable only for component faults. Not all component failures are covered, though the most common components (such as disk, fan, and power supplies) are covered. Note: ASR is not a system management or monitoring tool; {{it is designed to}} automatically open Oracle Service Requests when specific faults are detected on Oracle products that are qualified for ASR. Best practices include implementing a system management and monitoring solution along with ASR, such as Oracle Enterprise Manager Ops Center. Caution: The commands included in this document are provided for your convenience. However, the copy and paste functionality may not work as expected. To ensure the command text you copy {{is the same as the}} text you paste, make <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> console session set to receive data as UTF- 8. Recommended Configuration The recommended configuration is to install the ASR Manager, which receives fault telemetry information from the servers in Oracle Exadata Database Machine, on an external standalone server. This server must run Solaris or Linux as the operating system. Note: While not recommended, you may install the ASR Manager on one of the database servers in the Oracle Exadata Database Machine...|$|E

He can lift the cup of sack to his head without my assistance; and, should the said paternal head turn something giddy, there be men enough to guide his right honourable lordship to his lordship's right honourable couch.--Now, do not stare at me, Nigel, as if my words were to sink the boat with us. I love my father--I love him dearly--and I respect him, too, though I respect not many things; a trustier old Trojan never belted a broadsword by a loop of leather. But what then? He belongs to the old world, I to the new. He has his follies, I have mine; and the less either of us sees of the other's peccadilloes, the greater will be the honour and respect--that, I think, is the proper phrase--I say the respect in which we shall hold each other. Being apart, {{each of us is}} himself, such as nature and circumstances have made him; but, couple us up too closely together, you will be <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> in <b>your</b> leash either an old hypocrite or a young one, or perhaps both the one and t'other." ...|$|R
6000|$|I come, kind gentlemen, strange news to tell ye; [...] I am {{the ghost}} of poor {{departed}} Nelly. [...] Sweet ladies, be not frighted; I'll be civil, [...] I'm what I was, a little harmless devil.

[...] Gallants, look to't, you say there are no sprites; [...] But I'll come dance about your beds at nights. [...] And faith you'll be in a sweet kind of taking, [...] When I surprise you between sleep and waking. [...] To tell you true, I walk, because I die [...] Out of my calling, in a tragedy.

[...] I'll fit the fop; for I'll not one word say, [...] To excuse his godly out-of-fashion play; [...] A play, which, if you dare but twice sit out, [...] You'll all be slandered, and be thought devout.
