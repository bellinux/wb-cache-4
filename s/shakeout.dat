These defects {{can be caused}} by cold dies, low metal temperature, dirty metal, lack of venting, or too much lubricant.

The {{selection}} of the correct type of core depends on production quantity, production rate, required precision, required surface finish, {{and the type of}} metal being used. For example, certain metals are sensitive to gases that are given off by certain types of core sands; other metals have too low of a melting point to properly break down the binder for removal during the <b>shakeout.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} are the four steps in traditional die casting, also known as , these are also the basis {{for any of the}} die casting variations: die preparation, filling, ejection, and <b>shakeout.</b> The dies are prepared by spraying the mold cavity with lubricant. The lubricant both helps control the temperature of the die and it also assists in the removal of the casting. The dies are then closed and molten metal is injected into the dies under high pressure; between [...] Once the mold cavity is filled, the pressure is maintained until the casting solidifies. The dies are then opened and the shot (shots are different from castings because there can be multiple cavities in a die, yielding multiple castings per shot) is ejected by the ejector pins. Finally, the <b>shakeout</b> involves separating the scrap, which includes the gate, runners, sprues and flash, from the shot. This is often done using a special trim die in a power press or hydraulic press. Other methods of shaking out include sawing and grinding. A less labor-intensive method is to tumble shots if gates are thin and easily broken; separation of gates from finished parts must follow. This scrap is recycled by remelting it. The yield is approximately 67%.|$|E

40|$|After a {{buildup in}} the number of firms, new {{industries}} commonly experience a "shakeout " in which the number of firms declines sharply. Three theoretical perspectives on how technological change contributes to industry <b>shakeouts</b> are analyzed. The theories are used to synthesize predictions concerning technological change and industry evolution. The predictions inform an analysis of four U. S. industries that experienced sharp shakeouts: automobiles, tires, televisions, and penicillin. Using data on firm participation and innovation from the commercial inception of the four products through their formative eras, we uncover regularities in how the products evolved. The regularities suggest that <b>shakeouts</b> are not triggered by particular technological innovations nor by dominant designs, but by an evolutionary process in which technological innovation contributes to a mounting dominance by some early-entering firms. 1...|$|R

The empirical case is combined cycle gas turbine technology in the power generation industry, where two of four main incumbents (GE, ABB, Siemens, and Westinghouse) exited the industry {{after several years of}} competition. We show that the vast differences in firm performance are strongly related to variation in technological capabilities, such as sourcing and integration of knowledge from related industries and after-launch problem solving. The findings from this case may also be of general interest for studies of dynamics in other mature, complex industries. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

40|$|The adaptation-evolution {{strategies}} of firms {{have been a}} major area of interest. Internet based businesses operate in highly unstable environments witnessing <b>shakeouts</b> and changes in the industry structure. In this paper, we focus on the adaptive strategies and paths of adaptation of independent B 2 B marketplaces. The independent B 2 B marketplaces have undergone tremendous change with regard to their business models and products/services. Since their inception as pure market makers, these marketplaces have morphed into integration service providers with market making being one of the functions. What makes the adaptive {{strategies of}} B 2 B marketplaces interesting is the extremely short time period within which these changes happened. The research uses the case study methodology to identify the adaptive strategies of B 2 B marketplaces in terms of their product/service class evolution. The results based on the case studies suggest a three-stage adaptation model wherein the marketplaces progress through stages such as aggregation, transactions and integration.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the geographic distribution of producers in the television receiver and automobile industries is analyzed. Both industries experienced sharp <b>shakeouts</b> and evolved to be oligopolies, suggestive of increasing returns. The television receiver industry was initially concentrated regionally but evolved to be more dispersed over time. In contrast, the automobile industry was dispersed initially but evolved to be heavily concentrated around one city, Detroit, MI, that initially had no producers. Neither pattern conforms to theories that portray agglomerations as being beneficial to the firms that populate them. An alternative theory is developed and tested to explain the geographic {{evolution of}} the two industries. Firms are assumed to differ {{in terms of their}} initial competence at the time of entry, which shapes their long-term performance. They acquire their competence from firms in related industries and prior entrants into the new industry. The location and performance of entrants in both industries is analyzed, and it is shown how differential importance in the two sources of competence plays a critical role in explaining the contrasting {{evolution of the}} geographic structure of the two industries...|$|R
40|$|Change {{is readily}} seen both within {{organizations}} and within populations of organizations. Such {{change has been}} characterized as organization or population level learning or evolution. Underlying such change, is change at the individual human and social network level. Herein, it is asked, how does {{the way in which}} individuals learn {{and the way in which}} networks evolve reflect itself in organizational and population level learning. What changes should emerge at the organization and population level due to learning, information diffusion, and network change at the individual level? Herein it is argued that organization and population level phenomena, such as performance improvements, mis-learning, and <b>shakeouts</b> emerge from the on-going processes of change at the individual level. Looking at learning and information diffusion enables the organizational theorist to link micro and macro level organizational phenomena. - 2 -LEARNING WITHIN AND AMONG ORGANIZATIONS Few organizations can characterize themselves as unchanging.

40|$|Several {{scholars}} have influenced this study, though are not implicated by its conclusions. Dick Nelson {{and the group}} working {{with him on the}} long term evolution of a number of key industries have, through their discussions, helped me to formulate and clarify some of the issues discussed here.

This central unity is set forth in the general rule, to which there are not very many exceptions, that the development of the organism, whether social or physical, involves an increasing subdivision of functions between its separate parts on the one hand, and on the other a more intimate connection between them.

40|$|The {{creative}} {{destruction of}} existing industries {{as a consequence}} of discontinuous technological change is a central theme in the literature on industrial innovation and technological development. Established competence-based and market-based explanations of this phenomenon argue that incumbents are seriously challenged only by ‘competence-destroying’ or ‘disruptive’ innovations, which make their existing knowledge base or business models obsolete and leave them vulnerable to attacks from new entrants. This paper challenges these arguments. With detailed empirical analyses of the automotive and gas turbine industries, we demonstrate that these explanations overestimate the ability of new entrants to destroy and disrupt established industries and underestimate the capacity of incumbents to perceive the potential of new technologies and integrate them with existing capabilities. Moreover, we show how intense competition in the wake of technological discontinuities, driven entirely by incumbents, may instead result in late industry <b>shakeouts.</b> We develop and extend the notion of ‘creative accumulation’ as a way of conceptualizing the innovating capacity of the incumbents that appear to master such turbulence. Specifically, we argue that creative accumulation requires firms to handle a triple challenge of simultaneously (a) fine-tuning and evolving existing technologies at a rapid pace, (b) acquiring and developing new technologies and resources and (c) integrating novel and existing knowledge into superior products and solutions.

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between technology and industrial structure {{in the context of}} a growing market economy. Chapters 2 and 5 develop some general equilibrium models which permit a study of {{the relationship between}} quality competition, market structure and growth. Both market structure and the rate of growth are determined endogenously as functions of underlying parameters describing the pattern of technology and tastes, and the institutional environment. It is argued that quality competition constitutes an economic mechanism of primary importance, which provides essential incentives for innovation at the industry level, while also contributing to aggregate technological progress by way of R&D spillover effects. A related theme of the thesis is that constraints on quality competition are detrimental to growth. Chapter 3 presents a theoretical model which explains certain statistical regularities regarding cohort survival patterns, the persistence of firm turnover, and the appearance of <b>shakeouts</b> during an industry life cycle. By treating the market as comprising a number of strategically independent submarkets, this analysis separates the strategic interaction effects which occur at the submarket level, from the independence effects which operate across submarkets. Chapter 4 studies competition between two cohorts of radically different but substitutable technologies. By analyzing the entry of new-technology- based firms, the exit of incumbents and subsequent quality competition, this chapter explores the impact of a radical innovation on market structure and on the turnover of firms. Two critical levels of the parameter which measures the efficiency of the new technology are identified: the first must be attained for 'creative destruction' to take place, while the second must be attained for this 'creative destruction' process to take a 'drastic' form which involves the complete replacement of currently active firms by a wave of new entrants...|$|R
