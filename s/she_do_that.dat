6000|$|Peter was puzzled. He blinked {{his eyes}} and stroked his {{whiskers}} {{as he tried to}} understand what it all meant. [...] "Who is Sally Sly, and what did <b>she</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> for?" [...] he finally ventured.|$|E
50|$|It annoys me <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>that.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "No--I think <b>she</b> finds <b>she</b> <b>does.</b> But <b>that's</b> what I mean by so {{describing}} her. It's IF <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> splendid. But we'll see," [...] {{he wound}} up, [...] "where she comes out." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "There {{was a child}} {{going along}} out there {{and asked me if}} the postman had been by and I said yes, and she said how long since I saw him and I said I hadn't seen him at all, and she said how did I know he'd been by, then, and I said because I smelt his track on the sidewalk, and she said I was a dum fool and made a mouth at me. What did <b>she</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> for?" ...|$|E
60|$|But he saw nothing. He told her, good-naturedly, {{that she}} was young and ought to be amused and entertained, and must not allow herself to be made dull by a dull old fellow. Moreover, he said, he wanted to hear her sing all the new singer's songs to him; and how could <b>she</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> well, unless she went? So the Doctor persisted in making the {{engagement}} for her, and Mr. Jack Maldon was to come back to dinner. This concluded, he went to his Patent place, I suppose; but at all events went away on his horse, looking very idle.|$|E
60|$|Oh! I {{talked about}} Madam How lifting up Hartford Bridge Flat. How could <b>she</b> <b>do</b> <b>that?</b> My dear child, {{that is a}} long story, and I must tell it you some other time. Meanwhile, {{did you ever see}} the lid of a kettle rise up and shake when the water inside boiled? Of course; and of course, too, {{remember}} that Madam How must have done it. Then think over between this and our next talk, what that can possibly have to do with her lifting up Hartford Bridge Flat. But you have been longing, perhaps, all this time to hear more about Lady Why, and why she set Madam How to make Bracknell's Bottom.|$|E

60|$|But {{what should}} <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> <b>That</b> she should {{put on a}} gala dress and a smiling face and be carried off to church with a troop of lawyers and their wives to see her {{daughter}} become the bride of a low journeyman, was of course out of the question. By no act, by no word, by no sign would she give aught of a mother's authority to nuptials so disgraceful. Should her daughter become Lady Anna Thwaite, they two, mother and daughter, would never see each other again. Of so much at any rate she was sure. But could she be sure of nothing beyond that? She could at any rate make an effort.|$|E
60|$|The {{complication}} {{seemed to}} be very bad indeed. In the first place was it not clear that she, Lady Mary, {{ought not to be}} a party to asking Miss Boncassen to meet her brother at Matching? Would it not be imperative on her part to tell her father the whole story? And yet how could <b>she</b> <b>do</b> <b>that?</b> It had been told her in confidence, and she remembered what her own feelings had been when Mrs. Finn had suggested the propriety of telling the story which had been told to her! And how would it be possible to ask Lady Mabel to come to Matching to meet Miss Boncassen in the presence of Silverbridge? If the party could be made up without Silverbridge things might run smoothly.|$|E
60|$|When Benita woke {{the lamp}} had gone out, {{and it was}} pitch dark. Fortunately, however, she remembered where she had put the matches and the lantern with a candle in it. She lit the candle {{and looked at her}} watch. It was nearly six o'clock. The dawn must be {{breaking}} outside, within an hour or two Jacob Meyer would find that they had gone. Suppose that his rage should overcome his fear and that he should creep upon them. They would know nothing of it until his face appeared in the faint ring of light. Or he might even shoot her father out of the darkness. What could <b>she</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> would give them warning? A thought came to her.|$|E

6000|$|... "I am a scoundrel," [...] said Hans, {{overcome}} by this misplaced trust. [...] "That is my invention. Nobody knows <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>that.</b> Shall you {{forgive me for}} not saying so before?" ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the stillness}} of the night Trafford found himself {{thinking}} over Marjorie; it was a new form of mental exercise, which was destined to play a large part in his existence for many subsequent years. There had come a shadow on his confidence in her. She was a glorious person; she had a kind of fire behind her and in her--shining through her, like the lights in a fire-opal, but----He wished she had not made him promise to conceal their meeting and their close co-operation from her father. Why did <b>she</b> <b>do</b> <b>that?</b> It would spoil his case with her father, and it could forward things for them in no conceivable way. And from that, in some manner too subtle to trace, he found his mind wandering to another problem, which was destined to reappear with a slowly dwindling importance very often in this procedure of thinking over Marjorie in the small hours. It was the riddle--it never came to him in the daytime, but only in those intercalary and detachedly critical periods of thought--why exactly had she engaged herself to Magnet? Why had she? He couldn't imagine himself, in Marjorie's position, doing anything of the sort. Marjorie had ways of her own; she was different.... Well, anyhow, she was splendid and loving and full of courage.... He had got no further than this when at last he fell asleep.|$|E
6000|$|But, in truth, {{he had not}} yet read Isa's {{character}} very thoroughly. She {{had spoken}} truly in saying that she knew nothing of that boisterous love which was now tormenting him and making him gloomy; but nevertheless she loved him. She, in her short life, had learnt many lessons of self-denial; and now with reference to this half- promised husband she would again have practised such a lesson. Had he agreed at once to go from her, she would have balanced her own account within her own breast, and have kept to herself all her sufferings. There would have been no outward show of baffled love,- -none even in the colour of her cheeks; for such was the nature of her temperament. But she did suffer for him. Day by day she began to think that his love, though boisterous as she had at first called it, was more deep-seated than she had believed. He made no slightest sign that he would accept any of those proffers which she had made him of release. Though he said so loudly that this waiting for four years was an impossibility, he spoke of no course that would be more possible,--except that evidently impossible course of an early marriage. And thus, while he with redoubled vehemence charged her with coolness and want of love, her love waxed warmer and warmer, and his happiness became the chief object of her thoughts. What could <b>she</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> he might no longer suffer? ...|$|E
6000|$|But I am {{now coming}} to what must shock you, {{as much as}} it does me, [...] when she has {{occasion}} to lecture me (not very seldom you will think no [...] doubt) she does not do it in a manner that commands respect, and in an [...] impressive style. No! did <b>she</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> I should amend my faults with [...] pleasure, and dread to offend a kind though just mother. But she flies [...] into a fit of phrenzy, upbraids me as if I was the most undutiful [...] wretch in existence, rakes up the ashes of my father, abuses him, [...] says I shall be a true Byrrone, which is the worst epithet she can [...] invent. Am I to call this woman mother? Because by nature's law she [...] has authority over me, am I to be trampled upon in this manner? am I [...] to be goaded with insult, loaded with obloquy, and suffer my feelings [...] to be outraged on the most trivial occasions? I owe her respect as a [...] Son, But I renounce her as a Friend. What an example does she shew me! [...] I hope in God I shall never follow it. I have not told you all, nor [...] can I; I respect you as a female, nor, although I ought to confide in [...] you as a Sister, will I shock you with the repetition of Scenes, which [...] you may judge of by the Sample I have given you, and which to all but [...] you are buried in oblivion. Would they were so in my mind! I am afraid [...] they never will. And can I, my dear Sister, look up to this mother, [...] with that respect, that affection I ought? Am I to be eternally [...] subjected to her caprice? I hope not--; indeed a few short years will [...] emancipate me from the Shackles I now wear, and then perhaps she will [...] govern her passion better than at present.|$|E

5000|$|In August 2012, Hamm said [...] "The Other Woman" [...] was his {{favorite}} episode of the fifth season of Mad Men, and spoke about the reaction to Joan's storyline: When Other Woman" [...] aired, people were sort of outraged by the Joan storyline, like, [...] "Oh my God, how could <b>she</b> <b>do</b> <b>that?</b> What is she thinking?"
