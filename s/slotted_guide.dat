40|$|Introduction Fatigue {{and stress}} crack {{detection}} in metallic structures {{is of utmost}} importance to the in-service inspections of metallic components. Beside the crack detection, the prediction of the crack size leads to a better estimation of the useful life of the metal in service. Currently, there are several prominent nondestructive testing (NDT) techniques for detecting and sizing surface cracks in metals each of which possesses certain limitations and disadvantages, including the potential drop technique, the eddy current technique, and the surface magnetic field measurement technique. In the last decade, {{a great deal of}} attention has been given to the microwave non-destructive testing (MNDT) of materials. Yeh and Zoughi have demonstrated the potential use of MNDT for detection and sizing of surface-breaking cracks in metals [1]. In their work, the metal surface is scanned by an open-ended waveguide while its standing-wave characteristics is monitored using a <b>slotted</b> <b>guide</b> and...|$|E

There is still a case to be made for making one today; for example, if an odd size (say, 175mm) cornice is to be fixed, then a custom mitre box with a bottom board that is 175mm wide would ensure that the cornice sits true while the cuts are being made to it. The three pieces of timber that form the mitre box are nailed together, and the top steadying pieces are fixed with smaller panel pins.

50|$|Sometimes {{engineers}} {{will use}} these two terms interchangeably by calling a stoplog a flashboard. This {{is done in}} part because unlike many other types of bulkhead gates that are one continuous unit, both stoplogs and flashboards are modular and can be easily designed to hold back different amounts of water. However, most engineering texts and design firms differentiate between the two structures. Stoplogs are specialized bulkheads that are dropped into premade <b>slots</b> or <b>guides</b> in a channel or control structure, while flashboards are bulkheads that are placed on the crest or top of a channel wall or control structure. Flashboards are sometimes designed to break away under high flow conditions and thus to provide only a temporary diversion. In contrast, stoplogs are intended to be reused, and failure of a stoplog will result in an uncontrolled flow through a gate.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{proliferation}} of mobile devices, location-based services and embedded wireless sensors {{has given rise}} to applications that seek to improve the efficiency of the transportation system. In particular, new applications are arising that help travelers find parking in urban settings. They convey the parking slot availability around users on their mobile devices. Nevertheless, while engaged in driving, travelers are better suited being guided to an ideal parking slot, than looking at a map and deciding which open slot to visit. Then the question of how an application should choose this ideal parking <b>slot</b> to <b>guide</b> the user towards it becomes relevant. Vehicular parking can be viewed as vehicles (players) competing for parking slots (resources with different costs). Based on this competition, we present a game-theoretic framework to analyze parking situations. We introduce and analyze parking slot assignment games and present algorithms that choose parking slots ideally in competitive parking simulations. We also present algorithms for incomplete information contexts and show how these algorithms outperform greedy algorithms in most situations.

40|$|Abstract—Reliable {{communication}} is imperative for realising {{a vision of}} “Ambient Intelligence” where different devices gather and process informa-tion from different sources to exert control over the physical environment. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) have been employed to fulfil the necessity of reliable energy efficient communication between these devices. These networks consist of individual motes {{that are able to}} sense and control the en-vironment with the help of sensors and actuators. In this paper, we describe the implementation of an energy and cost efficient smart parking system for multi-floor parking facility using WSN. The system monitors the availability of free parking <b>slots</b> and <b>guides</b> the vehicle to the nearest free slot. Additional information such as the amount of time the vehicle has been parked is also monitored for billing purposes along with the status of each mote. Cost is minimized by keeping the number of sensors lower without sacrificing the reliability. Energy consumption of each mote is kept in check by allowing the systems to sleep periodically and by reducing their communication range.

40|$|Computer-guided piezocision {{can be used}} to {{overcome}} the disadvantages of corticotomy in accelerating orthodontic tooth movement. The aim of this clinical pilot {{study was to determine the}} accuracy of this technique. STROBE guidelines were followed. Ten patients were selected and treated. Using new dedicated planning software, the piezocision cuts were properly positioned in virtual models. A surgical guide was designed and printed with <b>slots</b> to <b>guide</b> the scalpel blade first and then the piezoelectric micro-saw. The slots limit the cortical incisions coronally and apically, and also limit the depth of penetration of the piezoelectric micro-saw. The patients underwent CBCT before and immediately after surgery, and the pre- and postoperative images were matched. Using software, the planned piezocisions were compared to the actual piezocisions, and the entry point and depth deviations were measured. Descriptive statistics, kappa statistics, and the t-test were used for the data analysis. The mean deviation at the entry point was 0. 67 mm (range 0. 06 - 1. 44 mm, standard deviation 0. 31). The mean depth deviation was 0. 54 mm (range 0. 17 - 0. 80 mm, standard deviation 0. 21). The limits of the use of computer-guided piezocision are set by the maximum deviation observed; thus a safety distance of 1. 5 mm should be considered, which confirms that this innovative technique is clinically applicable...|$|R

In the fall of 1989, WLNE dropped CBS' Guiding Light, moving the movie to 3:00 pm and adding more syndicated programming in the 5:00 pm hour; by mid-1990, the afternoon movie was dropped in favor of additional syndicated programming. In the fall of 1990, WLNE dropped the CBS Saturday morning cartoons in favor of several movies in that time <b>slot.</b> In 1991, <b>Guiding</b> Light was reinstated.

As a result, The Edge of Night lost a large portion of its audience. In addition to those factors working against it, the rest of CBS' drama lineup was performing well in the ratings and the network could not move the long-running serial to another time slot without risking pre-emption from local affiliates, which would have driven ratings even lower. An agreement was struck between CBS, Procter and Gamble, and ABC to get the necessary 30 minutes for the As the World Turns expansion. CBS would not renew The Edge of Night once its contract was up, and Procter and Gamble [...] moved the serial to ABC and aired it there.|$|R
50|$|During {{the third}} day solo in lunar orbit, Worden began to have some {{problems}} with the Mass Spectrometer. This was located {{on the end of}} a boom that is deployed and retracted periodically throughout the mission. Frequently instruments in the CM were indicating that it had failed to retract. To get it to retract properly he had to cycle the retract/deploy switch several times. During the EVA on the return to Earth, he inspected the housing and found that guide pins were barely coming through the <b>guide</b> <b>slot.</b> Further it was found that the problems with retraction always occurred after the housing had been in the shadow of the spacecraft, but would retract fully after being in sunlight. This was caused by the motor stalling out, implying that the parts of the boom were being deformed by thermal expansion. To stop this occurring, several modifications were made to the instruments used on Apollo 16 and Apollo 17.|$|R
50|$|Minic Motorways was {{a system}} of HO-scale road {{vehicles}} that followed a slot in a plastic roadway. The system aimed {{as far as possible}} for realism, and therefore the slot was as narrow as possible (about 1/8 in) with brass conductors placed vertically at each side. The vehicles picked up power via a small wheel (called a Gimbal Wheel) on their underside, which was divided into two halves by an insulating flange. At some time in the 1960s this mechanism was replaced by a pair of vertically sprung sliding pickups. These differed from that of electric racing car systems such as the same company's Scalextric, in which the electrical conductors were spaced more widely apart {{on each side of the}} <b>guide</b> <b>slot,</b> and were hence more stable.There was a small removable peg at the back of the vehicles to stabilize it when in reverse.Vehicles were controlled by a hand-held controller, which had a thumb-operated speed control plus a rotating reversing switch.|$|R
