The Suggested Sites feature is turned off by default and is disabled when the user is browsing with InPrivate enabled or visiting SSL-secured, intranet, IP address, or IDN address sites. Information that could be personally identifiable, such as the user's IP address and browser information is sent to Microsoft as an artifact of the HTTPS protocol. Microsoft has stated that they do not store this information.|$|E

2500|$|Although long {{walls were}} built at several {{locations}} in ancient Greece (Corinth and Megara being {{two of the}} best known examples) the Long Walls (...) generally refers to the walls built in several phases and connecting Athens to its ports at Piraeus and Phalerum, providing a <b>secure</b> <b>connection</b> to the sea even during times of siege. These walls were of about 6km in length, were constructed in the mid 5th century BC, destroyed by the Spartans in 403 BC after Athens' defeat in the Peloponnesian War and rebuilt again with Persian support during the Corinthian War. [...] They were a key element of Athenian strategy, since they provided the city with a constant link to the sea and prevented it from being besieged by land alone.|$|E
2500|$|On 30 December, the tow {{lines of}} Aiviq and Nanuq parted again, and Kulluk began {{drifting}} towards the coast. Another tugboat, the 10,000-horsepower Alert operated by Crowley Marine Services, also arrived {{to the scene}} from Prince William Sound. Shortly after midnight, Alert was able to <b>secure</b> <b>connection</b> to the [...] towing line previously used by Aiviq {{and later in the}} morning the icebreaker had also reconnected to Kulluk about [...] southeast from Kodiak Island. USCGC Alex Haley also returned to the scene from Kodiak, where the cutter had repaired her fouled port propeller, and relieved the crew of USCGC Spar as on scene commander. The helicopter crews were also preparing to deploy several technicians aboard the drilling rig to evaluate the condition of the towing lines.|$|E
2500|$|Quantum key {{distribution}} {{is vulnerable to}} a man-in-the-middle attack when used without authentication {{to the same extent}} as any classical protocol, since no known principle of quantum mechanics can distinguish friend from foe. As in the classical case, Alice and Bob cannot authenticate each other and establish a <b>secure</b> <b>connection</b> without some means of verifying each other's identities (such as an initial shared secret). If Alice and Bob have an initial shared secret then they can use an unconditionally secure authentication scheme (such as Carter-Wegman,) along with quantum {{key distribution}} to exponentially expand this key, using a small amount of the new key to authenticate the next session. Several methods to create this initial shared secret have been proposed, for example using a 3rd party or chaos theory. Nevertheless, only [...] "almost strongly universal" [...] family of hash functions can be used for unconditionally secure authentication.|$|E

2500|$|Technically the 1796 heavy cavalry sword was a backsword, {{that is a}} sword with a {{straight}} blade with one cutting edge and the opposite edge of the blade (the [...] "back") thickened {{for most of its}} length to give added strength. The blade was [...] in length, with a single broad fuller each side. The grip was of ribbed wood, or wood bound with cord to resemble the same, and covered in leather. The iron backpiece of the grip had ears which were riveted through the tang of the blade to give the hilt and blade a very <b>secure</b> <b>connection.</b> The hilt combined a disc guard pierced with 2 semicircular and 6 oval (never circular) holes, with single knucklebow and two slim [...] long langets (projections from the guard, which gripped the throat of the scabbard) extending {{from the front of the}} guard. The langets were often removed and the left side of the guard ground away so as to reduce wear to uniforms. The latter modification would also have made it more comfortable to wear, especially on horseback.|$|E
