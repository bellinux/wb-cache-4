25|$|On August 1, 1876, Hickok {{was playing}} poker at Nuttal & Mann's Saloon in Deadwood, Dakota Territory. When a seat opened {{up at the}} table, a drunk man named Jack McCall sat down to play. McCall lost heavily. Hickok {{encouraged}} McCall to quit the game until he could cover his losses and offered to give him money for breakfast. Though McCall accepted the money, he was apparently insulted. The next day, Hickok was playing poker again. He usually <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> back to a wall {{so he could see}} the entrance, but the only seat available when he joined the game was a chair facing away from the door. He asked another man at the table, Charles Rich, to change seats with him twice, but Rich refused.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of June 20, 1947, as Siegel <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> {{associate}} Allen Smiley in Virginia Hill's Beverly Hills home reading the Los Angeles Times, an assailant fired {{at him through the}} window with a [...]30 caliber military M1 carbine, hitting him many times, including twice in the head. No one was charged with the murder, and the crime remains officially unsolved.|$|E
2500|$|In 1851 Warfield parish {{changed for}} the first time on record to create a Parish of Bracknell with its own church, Holy Trinity. In 1860 William Cocks wrote an account of Warfield church. [...] He {{describes}} box pews, whitewashed ceiling, and a gallery across the back with a barrel organ given by Lady Jane Walsh. There was a two-deck pulpit, and the farm workers sat at the back on benches. The west gallery later to be known as the [...] "Ormathwaite gallery" [...] was entered by a stairway from inside the church, where his Lordship <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> servant.|$|E
60|$|Kennedy <b>sat</b> {{thinking}} <b>with</b> <b>his</b> fine forehead wrinkled and <b>his</b> fingers playing <b>with</b> <b>his</b> long, fair moustache.|$|R
60|$|Razumov <b>sat</b> still <b>with</b> <b>his</b> head {{leaning on}} his hand, which nearly {{concealed}} the unshaded eye.|$|R
60|$|And he <b>sat</b> still, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> sneering smile, {{conscious}} that Irene was sitting still, and smiling too.|$|R
2500|$|In early 1917, the Sopwith chief engineer, Herbert Smith, began {{designing}} a new fighter (internal Sopwith designation 5F.1) {{powered by the}} geared 200hp Hispano-Suiza 8B. The resulting Dolphin was a two-bay, single-seat biplane, with the upper wings attached to an open steel cabane frame above the cockpit. To maintain the correct centre of gravity, the lower wings were positioned [...] forward of the upper wings, creating the Dolphin’s distinctive negative wing stagger. The pilot <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> head through the frame, where he had an excellent view. This configuration sometimes caused difficulty for novices, who {{found it difficult to}} keep the aircraft pointed at the horizon because the nose was not visible from the cockpit. The cockpit was nevertheless warm and comfortable, in part because pipes ran alongside the cockpit walls to the two side-mounted radiator blocks. Shutters in front of each radiator core allowed the engine temperature to be controlled.|$|E
2500|$|Doomadgee family spokesman, Brad Foster, {{claimed that}} after the men had been put into the cells, fifteen minutes lapsed before a seven-second check was done on the inmates. Forty two minutes later a second police officer {{observed}} that Mulrunji was a strange colour and was cold to the touch. The officer {{could not find a}} pulse. [...] When alerted to this, Arresting Officer Chris Hurley came into the cell and thought he could detect a pulse. According to statements an ambulance was then called taking fifteen minutes to arrive. [...] During this time no attempts were made to resuscitate the prisoner, although the autopsy found that {{there would have been no}} chance of saving him. The videotape footage from the cell shows Chris Hurley checking for breathing and pulse then [...] "sliding down the wall of the cell until he <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> face in his hands".|$|E
2500|$|On 11 May 1182, Saladin, {{along with}} half of the Egyptian Ayyubid army and {{numerous}} non-combatants, left Cairo for Syria. On the evening before he departed, he <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> companions and the tutor of one of his sons quoted a line of poetry: [...] "enjoy the scent of the ox-eye plant of Najd, for after this evening it will come no more." [...] Saladin took this as an evil omen and he never saw Egypt again. Knowing that Crusader forces were massed upon the frontier to intercept him, he took the desert route across the Sinai Peninsula to Ailah {{at the head of the}} Gulf of Aqaba. Meeting no opposition, Saladin ravaged the countryside of Montreal, whilst Baldwin's forces watched on, refusing to intervene. He arrived in Damascus in June to learn that Farrukh-Shah had attacked the Galilee, sacking Daburiyya and capturing Habis Jaldek, a fortress of great importance to the Crusaders. In July, Saladin dispatched Farrukh-Shah to attack Kawkab al-Hawa. Later, in August, the Ayyubids launched a naval and ground assault to capture Beirut; Saladin led his army in the Bekaa Valley. The assault was leaning towards failure and Saladin abandoned the operation to focus on issues in Mesopotamia.|$|E

60|$|Her father <b>sat</b> silent, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> face bent down. His {{breathing}} {{was a little}} quickened; but he repressed all other signs of agitation.|$|R
6000|$|Appleby <b>sat</b> down <b>with</b> <b>his</b> {{back against}} the wall, and laughed {{somewhat}} hollowly. “No,” he said. “The only appropriate music would be a requiem.” ...|$|R
60|$|Stanley at last {{took the}} chair {{he had so}} long refused. He <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> arms folded.|$|E
60|$|Dong! Dong! {{rang the}} alarm-bell. The Baron <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> eyes bent upon the floor, scowling blackly.|$|E

60|$|The very word {{story was}} enough to make Peter forget {{everything}} else, and he promptly <b>sat</b> down <b>with</b> <b>his</b> big eyes fixed on Grandfather Frog.|$|R
60|$|When at last, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> grim {{face turned}} toward the window, he <b>sat</b> silently <b>with</b> <b>his</b> {{clinched}} hands on his knees before him, Islington asked where his wife was now.|$|R
60|$|Captain Eli made no answer. He still <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> {{elbows on}} his knees and his hands in his hair.|$|E
60|$|Francis {{broke off}} {{abruptly}} {{in the middle}} of his sentence. He <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> eyes fixed upon the door, silent and speechless.|$|E
60|$|Xodar still <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> face {{buried in}} his hands. I walked {{to his side}} and placed my hand upon his shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|... "Allow me, Mr. Hawley," [...] {{said the}} chairman; and Mr. Hawley, still fuming, bowed half impatiently, and <b>sat</b> down <b>with</b> <b>his</b> hands thrust {{deep in his}} pockets.|$|R
60|$|He {{threw his}} {{cigarette}} away {{as though the}} flavour had suddenly become distasteful and <b>sat</b> drumming <b>with</b> <b>his</b> fingers upon the table, his eyes fixed upon Nora.|$|R
60|$|They did it together, {{and then}} Nasmyth <b>sat</b> down, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> face drawn and lined. Laura stood still {{a moment or}} two with the lantern in her hand.|$|R
