5000|$|The last {{remaining}} FERC requirement {{for a new}} Alcoa Yadkin Project license is a Section 401 water quality certificate, and recent opposition to Alcoa's relicensing has centered around it. In November 2007, the NC Division of Water Quality (DWQ) issued APGI a Section 401 water quality certificate for the Yadkin Project. The certificate was later withdrawn due {{to the failure of}} DWQ to publish a required public notice. APGI reapplied for a water quality certificate, which DWQ issued on May 9, 2009.

Some upgrades have been made at the Narrows dam, although the complete upgrade program won't be completed until after the issuance of a license.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The {{purpose of this study}} was to produce quantitative data necessary for a critical evaluation of regulatory techniques. Main Topics : Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions Durable goods purchased, advertising (i. e. where product was advertised, content of advertisement, misrepresentation etc), where goods were purchased (i. e. shop/garage, mail order - 8 categories), contact made by seller (in particular, techniques used by salesman), information given by salesman/seller/agent etc (particularly whether this was misleading and whether respondent received the exact goods ordered). Respondent satisfaction with goods purchased and the sales transaction is recorded together with his knowledge of Which? magazine. Detailed information is available for: arrangements for return of goods or cancellation of the deal - if the respondent attempted to do one of these, how he went about it and the outcome are noted; complaints (i. e. from whom advice was sought, action taken, seller's reaction and outcome are given); the agreement (i. e. content, let-out clauses, terms of deposit, credit and interest, etc and <b>surety</b> <b>required</b> for credit are recorded). A section is included particularly on the purchase of motor vehicles. This includes: length of time respondent had been driving when he bought vehicle, age of vehicle bought and whether it had a current MOT Test Certificate, whether respondent had any mechanical check made, whether delivery date was met by seller, whether vehicle was in good condition (whether all accessories ordered were included), whether it was under guarantee (a list of defects is given together with a note of money spent on repairs since purchase and complaints made to the dealer about this). Data on loans: loan company money borrowed from, advertising used (accuracy noted), any contacts between the loan company and the seller of the goods purchased, amount borrowed by respondent (including interest rate, total amount repaid, etc). Content of agreement signed considered in detail and respondent dissatisfaction with loan transaction recorded. If payment became overdue, reason is given and the outcome noted (including a note of the technique used by the company to obtain money-particularly harrassment, court action, etc). Similar data for other sources of credit are also available. Background Variables Household composition, sex, age when ordered goods, occupation and social grade, fluency in English, whether respondent is obviously a member of a minority racial or ethnic group, type of accommodation (i. e. house, flat, etc) and length of time respondent had been resident at address when goods were purchased...|$|R
50|$|The {{proliferation}} of freight brokers {{called for an}} increase in financial integrity and liability of these companies, which has led to the passing of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21). In order to obtain a license to broker freight, a freight brokerage must purchase a surety bond or trust agreement with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA). Prior to June 2012 when the bill was signed by President Obama, the <b>surety</b> bond coverage <b>required</b> to hold a broker license was $10,000. Effective October 1, 2013, the surety bond requirement increased to $75,000. On December 12, 2015 the FMCSA brought into effect, the United Registration System. Existing freight brokers with a USDOT, MC, or FF number can continue to do business until April 14, 2017 before they must switch to the new electronic online URS system.|$|R

50|$|Until {{recently}} {{nearly all}} beverage distillation {{was a result}} of very large operations. The reason for this consolidation was the heavy administrative burden involved in the collection of excise taxes by the United States Treasury Department through the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (Formerly Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives). As a result of several simplifications to the excise regulations and the reduction of <b>required</b> <b>Surety</b> Bonds for small beverage alcohol producers, a number of small craft distillerys began opening with an emphasis on unique and handcrafted beverage spirits. In Colorado there has been a particular interest: in 2000 there were no licensed distilleries in the state today there are 14 licensed distilleries http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite?c=Page&cid=1209635770768&pagename=Rev-Liquor%2FLIQLayout of which Downslope Distilling is one. Craft distilleries distinguish themselves from the large distilleries by creating niche products with unique properties that distinguish them in the marketplace.|$|R

40|$|Networked {{systems of}} low-cost, small, {{integrable}} chemical sensors will enable monitoring of Nonproliferation and Materials Control targets {{and chemical weapons}} threats. Sandia-designed prototype chemical sensor systems are undergoing extended field testing supported by DOE and other government agencies. A <b>required</b> <b>surety</b> component will be verification of microanalytical system performance, which {{can be achieved by}} providing a programmable source of chemical signature(s) for autonomous calibration of analytical systems. In addition, such a controlled chemical source could be used to dispense microaliquots of derivatization reagents, extending the analysis capability of chemical sensors to a wider range of targets. We have developed a microfabricated system for controlled release of selected compounds (calibrants) into the analytical stream of microsensor systems. To minimize pumping and valve requirements of microfluidic systems, and to avoid degradation issues associated with storage of dilute solutions, we have utilized thermally labile organic salts as solid-phase reservoir materials. Reproducible deposition of tetrapropyl ammonium hydroxide onto arrays of microfabricated heating elements can provide a pair of calibration marker compounds (one fast and one slow-eluting compound) for GC analyses. The use of this microaliquot gas source array for hydrogen generation is currently under further development. The goal of the latter effort will be to provide a source of high-pressure, low viscosity GC carrier gas for Sandia's next-generation microfabricated gas-phase chemical analysis systems...|$|R

Some of the consequences may be politically and economically disruptive, and expensive to remedy. For the next several centuries, fuel requirements will increase with population, land use, and ecosystem degradation.

Looking at U. S. energy challenges from a surety perspective offers new insights on possible strategies for developing solutions to challenges. The energy surety model with its focus on the attributes of security and sustainability could be extrapolated into a global energy system using a more comprehensive energy surety model than that used here. In fact, the success of the energy <b>surety</b> strategy ultimately <b>requires</b> a more global perspective. We use a 200 year time frame for sustainability because extending farther into the future would almost certainly miss the advent and perfection of new technologies or changing needs of society...|$|R
