40|$|Macroautophagy (hereafter termed autophagy) is a {{cellular}} membrane-trafficking process that functions to deliver cytoplasmic constituents to lysosomes for degradation. Autophagy operates at basal levels {{to turn over}} damaged and misfolded proteins {{and it is the}} only process for the turnover of organelles. The process is therefore critically important for the preservation of cellular integrity and viability. Autophagy is also highly adaptable and the rate and cargoes of autophagy can be altered to bring about desired cellular responses to intracellular and environmental cues, disease states and a <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> drugs. As a result, there is much interest in understanding the dynamics of autophagy in a variety of situations. To date, the majority of assays to monitor autophagy either measure changes in a parameter of the process at a set point in time or use markers/tracers to monitor flow of membrane-bound proteins from one point in the process to another. As such, these assays do not measure changes in endogenous cargo degradation which is the ultimate end-point of the autophagy process. We describe here an assay to measure autophagic cargo degradation by engineering cells to degrade mitochondria en masse. We show that this ‘enhanced-mitophagy’ assay can be used to measure differences in the rate of autophagy between different cells or in response to agents which are known to promote or inhibit autophagic flux. We consider therefore that this assay will prove to be a valuable resource for investigations in which autophagy is considered important and is believed to be modulated...|$|E

The wide range of their biological activities depends generally on their related aldehyde or ketone groups. Here, we report the pharmacological activities of some thiosemicarbazones synthesized in this work. Benzophenone and derivatives were used with N(4) -phenyl- 3 -thiosemicarbazide to synthesize corresponding five thiosemicarbazones (1 - 5). Their structures were characterized by spectrometrical methods analysis IR, NMR (1) H & (13) C and MS. The compounds were then screened in vitro for their antiparasitic activity and toxicity on Trypanosoma brucei brucei and Artemia salina Leach respectively. The selectivity index of each compound was also determined. Four thiosemicarbazones such as 4, 2, 3 and 1 reveal interesting trypanocidal activities with their half inhibitory concentration (IC 50) equal to 2. 76, 2. 83, 3. 86 and 8. 48  μM respectively, while compound 5 (IC 50  =  12. 16  μM) showed a moderate anti-trypanosomal activity on parasite.

40|$|Both new {{guidelines}} concerning elemental impurity limit concentrations and novel analytical procedures for elemental analysis of pharmaceutical substances are being {{adopted by the}} United States Pharmacopeia (USP). This paper outlines the optimization of two sample preparation procedures for organic pharmaceutical excipient products, one relying on direct dissolution in an aqueous medium and another on microwave-assisted acid digestion. Optimization particularly involved the stabilization and reliable determination of Hg, Pd and Os. Analyte concentrations and spike recoveries were determined in two organic pharmaceutical excipients using a quadrupole ICP-MS instrument equipped with a collision–reaction cell. Aqueous dissolution was achieved with 0. 009 mMKBrO 3 in 1 % (v/v) HNO 3 and 1 % (v/v) HCl and microwave-assisted acid digestion was performed with aqua regia. Polyatomic interferences originally hampering the accurate determination of 51 V, 52 Cr, 53 Cr, 55 Mn, 56 Fe and 75 As were eliminated through introduction of He/H 2 collision–reaction gas at a flow rate of 4. 5 – 5. 1 ml min- 1 and applying a kinetic energy barrier of 3 V between the hexapole collision–reaction cell and the quadrupole analyzer. Limits of detection {{were more than a}} factor of ten lower than the proposed limit concentrations for parenteral administration and the impurity concentrations in the products tested never exceeded the limit concentrations defined by USP. Elemental spike recoveries ranged between 93. 8 and 109. 9 % when standard addition was used for calibration, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) < 12. 7 %. It is expected that the proposed procedures can be directly implemented for routine impurity analysis of a broad <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> substances...|$|E

40|$|Shadab Alam,* Jiban J Panda,* Virander S Chauhan International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, New Delhi, India*Both authors contributed {{equally to}} this workBackground: Curcumin, the {{principal}} curcuminoid {{of the popular}} Indian spice turmeric, has a wide <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> properties such as antitumor, antioxidant, antiamyloid, and anti-inflammatory activity. However, poor aqueous solubility and low bioavailability of curcumin is a major challenge in its development as a useful drug. To enhance the aqueous solubility and bioavailability of curcumin, {{attempts have been made}} to encapsulate it in liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles (NPs), lipid-based NPs, biodegradable microspheres, cyclodextrin, and hydrogels. Methods: In this work, we attempted to entrap curcumin in novel self-assembled dipeptide NPs containing a nonprotein amino acid, &alpha;,&beta;-dehydrophenylalanine, and investigated the biological activity of dipeptide-curcumin NPs in cancer models both in vitro and in vivo. Results: Of the several dehydrodipeptides tested, methionine-dehydrophenylalanine was the most suitable one for loading and release of curcumin. Loading of curcumin in the dipeptide NPs increased its solubility, improved cellular availability, enhanced its toxicity towards different cancerous cell lines, and enhanced curcumin&rsquo;s efficacy towards inhibiting tumor growth in Balb/c mice bearing a B 6 F 10 melanoma tumor. Conclusion: These novel, highly biocompatible, and easy to construct dipeptide NPs with a capacity to load and release curcumin in a sustained manner significantly improved curcumin&rsquo;s cellular uptake without altering its anticancer or other therapeutic properties. Curcumin-dipeptide NPs also showed improved in vitro and in vivo chemotherapeutic efficacy compared to curcumin alone.

Although the theories explaining SERS are not definite and still evolving, the experimental research and development in recent years has demonstrated SERS to be a potential technique for environmental and biological trace analysis, enabling the detection of even single molecules. Moreover, it can provide information about the changes of molecular identity or orientation to the metal surface with the concentration. In many cases the surface-adsorbed molecule may exist in a variety of forms related to one another by means of an acid–base reaction, complex formation, tautomerization, and the like.

The device utilizes the ferroelectric properties of barium titanate (BaTiO_ 3) {{to take advantage of the}} high electric field resulting from polarization switching in the material. The source comprises a [001]-oriented barium titanate crystal (5 × 5 × 1 mm) with a metallic rear electrode and a metallic grid front electrode. When a high voltage AC waveform is applied to the rear electrode to switch polarization, the resulting electric field on the face of the crystal promotes electron emission and results in plasma formation between the crystal face and the grounded grid at ambient pressure. Interaction with this plasma and the resulting reagent ions effects ionization of trace neutrals. The source requires less than 1 W of power to operate under most circumstances, ionizes molecules with acidic and basic functional groups easily, and has proven quite versatile for ambient analysis of both vapor phase and aspirated powdered solid samples. Ionization of vapor phase samples of the organics triethylamine, tripropylamine, tributylamine, and pyridine results in observation of the singly protonated species in the positive ion mass spectrum with sensitivity extending into the high ppb range.

40|$|Abstract Background Analyses of the {{pore size}} {{distribution}} in 3 D matrices such as the cell-hydrogel interface are very useful when studying changes and modifications produced {{as a result of}} cellular growth and proliferation within the matrix, as pore size distribution {{plays an important role in}} the signaling and microenvironment stimuli imparted to the cells. However, the majority of the methods for the assessment of the porosity in biomaterials are not suitable to give quantitative information about the textural properties of these nano-interfaces. Findings Here, we report a methodology for determining pore size distribution at the cell-hydrogel interface, and the depth of the matrix modified by cell growth by entrapped HepG 2 cells in microcapsules made of 0. 8 % and 1. 4 % w/v alginate. The method is based on the estimation of the shortest distance between two points of the fibril-like network hydrogel structures using image analysis of TEM pictures. Values of pore size distribution determined using the presented method and those obtained by nitrogen physisorption measurements were compared, showing good agreement. A combination of these methodologies and a study of the cell-hydrogel interface at various cell culture times showed that after three days of culture, HepG 2 cells growing in hydrogels composed of 0. 8 % w/v alginate had more coarse of pores at depths up to 40 nm inwards (a phenomenon most notable in the first 20 nm from the interface). This coarsening phenomenon was weakly observed in the case of cells cultured in hydrogels composed of 1. 4 % w/v alginate.

PCA of the corresponding NIR spectra appeared to be a useful combination to classify the tablets in accordance with their physical and chemical properties. Finally, the quantitative potentials of NIR were studied by the analysis of Tamoxifen tablets. From measurements on both intact and powdered tablets it was concluded that NIR can be used for quantification of the amount of active ingredients. However, small differences in dosage appear to be difficult to determine. The results demonstrate that NIR can be a fast and non-destructive alternative to conventional, more elaborate, methods that are currently in use for qualitative and quantitative purposes. De mogelijkheden en de beperkingen van nabij-infrarood spectroscopie voor de analyse van farmaceutische producten zijn onderzocht. Vier mogelijke toepassingen zijn bestudeerd. Eerst werd de bruikbaarheid voor identiteitscontrole onderzocht. Van 327 farmaceutisch producten, die worden gebruikt voor de bereiding van vaccinmedia werden NIR spectra opgenomen. Een deel van de spectra werd gebruikt om een calibratie set samen te stellen. De overige spectra werden gebruikt voor validatie. De correlatieco 6 ffici 6 nt bleek een nuttige parameter om de identiteit met hoge betrouwbaarheid te bevestigen. De tweede toepassing was kwaliteitscontrole. De NIR spectra van 72 glycerol monsters afkomstig van de zogenaamde Ha 6 tiaanse affaire zijn vergeleken met 45 referentiestandaarden van glycerol 85 % en 98 %. Standaarden en monsters konden duidelijk worden onderscheiden na principale componenten analyse (PCA) van de spectra. De mogelijkheid om productiebronnen van farmaceutische producten vast te stellen werd bestudeerd aan de hand van 18 monsters Metandienon tableten en 7 monsters Tamoxifen tabletten van verschillende oorsprong. PCA van de opgenomen NIR spectra bleek een bruikbare methode om de tabletten in overeenstemming met de fysische en chemische eigenschappen te classificeren. Als laatste werden de kwantitatieve mogelijkheden van NIR onderzocht door analyse van Tamoxifen tabletten. Uit metingen van intacte en verpoederde tabletten kan worden geconcludeerd dat NIR bruikbaar is voor de kwantificering van de hoeveelheid actieve stof. Kleine verschillen in de dosering zijn echter moeilijk aan te tonen. De resultaten laten zien dat NIR een snelle en niet-destructief alternatief kan zijn voor conventionele en meer bewerkelijke methoden, die momenteel in gebruik zijn voor kwalitatieve en kwantitatieve doeleinden...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{threat of}} {{emerging}} pathogens and microbial drug resistance has spurred tremendous {{efforts to develop}} new and more effective antimicrobial strategies. Recently, a novel ultrashort pulsed (USP) laser technology has been developed that enables efficient and chemical-free inactivation <b>of</b> a wide <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> viral and bacterial pathogens. Such a technology circumvents the need to introduce potentially toxic chemicals and could permit safe and environmentally friendly pathogen reduction, with a multitude of possible applications including the sterilization <b>of</b> <b>pharmaceuticals</b> and blood products, and the generation of attenuated or inactivated vaccines. </p...|$|R
