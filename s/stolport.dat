5|$|The Alcan Aquarium {{built for}} the Expo {{remained}} in operation {{for a number of}} decades until its closure in 1991. The Expo 67 parking lot was converted into Victoria <b>STOLport,</b> an experimental short-take off airport for a brief time in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Widerøe {{came with}} an {{alternative}} proposal and suggested that a network of smaller airports be built instead, which could be served using short take-off and landing (STOL) aircraft. Smaller airports could be built and operated at lower costs than larger airports, but both airports and airlines would need subsidies to operate. Håkon Kyllingmark was appointed Minister of Transport and Communications in 1965 and was a proponent of the <b>STOLport</b> proposal. The political rationale was that, despite that the total operating costs would rise, that it would provide better services to rural areas and thus keep up their population. The regional airports were built in groups, and the first four were built in Namsos and Helgeland.|$|E

50|$|<b>STOLports</b> are {{not common}} {{but can be}} found, for example, at London City Airport in London, United Kingdom. Some sparsely {{populated}} countries have several, e.g. Norway and Greenland. There were also several <b>STOLports</b> in the United States that were used for scheduled passenger airline operations but are now no longer in existence.|$|R

50|$|Based on the Norwegian example, several short runway {{airports}} (800-900 meters) {{were built}} in Greenland, replacing heliports. The country at that time only had a few airports, built by the US defense in hidden locations far from Greenlandic settlements. Still the short runway airports (including at the capital Nuuk) can't accept flights from distant places like Denmark or the UK. Some of the airports of Iceland are <b>STOLports,</b> although most are longer. The availability of STOL aircraft has enabled Air Iceland to extend its network to Greenland.|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} {{commuter}} airlines in the United States got their start by operating Twin Otters in scheduled passenger operations. Houston Metro Airlines (which later {{changed its name}} to Metro Airlines) constructed their own <b>STOLport</b> airstrip with a passenger terminal and maintenance hangar in Clear Lake City, Texas, near the NASA Johnson Space Center. The Clear Lake City <b>STOLport</b> was specifically designed for Twin Otter operations. According to the February 1976 edition of the Official Airline Guide, Houston Metro operated 22 round-trip flights every weekday at this time between Clear Lake City (CLC) and Houston Intercontinental Airport (IAH, now Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport) in a scheduled passenger airline shuttle operation. Houston Metro had agreements in place for connecting passenger feed services with Continental Airlines and Eastern Airlines at Houston Intercontinental, with this major airport having a dedicated STOL landing area at the time specifically for Twin Otter flight operations. The Clear Lake City <b>STOLport</b> is no longer in existence.|$|E
25|$|On 27 June 1982 Brymon Captain Harry Gee {{landed a}} de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7 {{turboprop}} aircraft on Heron Quays, {{in the nearby}} West India Docks, in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the <b>STOLport</b> project. Later that year the LDDC published a feasibility study, an opinion poll amongst local residents showed a majority in favour {{of the development of}} the airport, and Mowlem submitted the application for planning permission.|$|E
25|$|The {{airport was}} first {{proposed}} in 1981 by Reg Ward, who was Chief Executive {{of the newly}} formed London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC) that {{was responsible for the}} regeneration of the area. He in turn discussed the proposal with Sir Philip Beck (Chairman of John Mowlem & Co plc) and the idea of an airport for Docklands was born. By November of that year Mowlem and Bill Bryce of Brymon Airways had submitted an outline proposal to the LDDC for a Docklands <b>STOLport</b> city centre gateway.|$|E
2500|$|The {{government}} {{issued the}} task of operating the routes to Widerøe, who initially served it with its 19-seat de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters. Services commenced to Bergen Airport, Flesland and Ålesund Airport, Vigra, {{as well as between}} the <b>STOLports.</b> Widerøe built its main base for Southern Norway at Florø Airport, consisting of a [...] hangar and manned with six mechanics. Widerøe introduced the de Havilland Canada Dash 7 on the route from Florø and Sogndal to Oslo Airport, Fornebu in September 1983. Widerøe replaced its Twin Otters and Dash 7s with the de Havilland Canada Dash 8 in the early 1990s.|$|R
5|$|By April 2000, {{the number}} of {{services}} by the main airlines was reduced to less than the level before the opening of Gardermoen, with 75 daily departures. Braathens had 33 daily departures, SAS had 22 and Widerøe had 20. Of Braathens' services, 14 were to Oslo, 15 to cities on the West Coast (of which four were operated by Norwegian Air Shuttle) and four were to Bodø, Harstad/Narvik and Tromsø. SAS operated 15 daily flights to Oslo, while eight were operated to Bodø, Harstad/Narvik and Tromsø. One flight was to their main hub in Copenhagen. This was the last year that SAS used DC-9s to Trondheim, phasing in Boeing 737 Next Generation aircraft, supplemented by occasional MD-80s. Widerøe had 15 daily flights to <b>STOLports</b> in Helgeland, and five flights to Sandefjord.|$|R
25|$|The airline {{was founded}} in 1934, and was engaged in various general {{aviation}} activities. In 1936, Widerøe started scheduled seaplane flights and, from 1940, also ambulance flights. During the 1940s and 1950s, the airline increased its seaplane routes and established a fleet based on de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter and Noorduyn Norseman aircraft. From 1968, Widerøe started flying to <b>STOLports</b> built in northern and western Norway using DHC-6 Twin Otters, and later also with Dash 7 aircraft. In 1989, Widerøe bought Norsk Air and started services from Sandefjord. During the 1990s, it replaced all its aircraft with Dash 8 aircraft; in the 2000s it was bought by the SAS Group and took over SAS Commuter's operations in northern Norway. In 2010, Widerøe took over regional SAS services in western Norway.|$|R
25|$|Following a 1962 {{government}} commission {{investigating the}} construction of new airports, Widerøe launched an alternative proposal and suggested that a network of smaller airports be built instead.

25|$|Of {{the five}} applicants, Dash Air {{had dropped out}} and in August, the CTC {{selected}} City Centre Airways to operate Dash 7 planes between the island, Ottawa and Montreal. City Centre immediately got into a dispute with the Government of Canada. Canada expected City Centre {{to pay for the}} Victoria <b>STOLport</b> in Montreal, which meant building a terminal and improving the runways at an estimated cost of $5 million, while Canada would pay for navigational aids. Victoria (a former parking lot for Expo 67) had been used in trials of STOL service between Ottawa and Montreal several years earlier. Two of the failed applicants, Bradley and Canavia, sought to overturn the decision in different appeals. An additional difficulty for City Centre was the high interest rates at the time, 21.5%, and City Centre had expected to finance three-quarters of the startup cost.|$|E

25|$|The CTC {{decision}} to award the license to City Centre was overturned on appeal in March 1982. A review committee, considering the original decision, {{found that the}} funding of the <b>STOLport</b> in Montreal, {{and the ability of}} the applicants to pay for the port, was not addressed and overturned the decision sending back to the CTC to reconsider. In August 1982, Air Atonabee, which already had a license to fly in the Toronto-Ottawa-Montreal triangle, announced that it would buy five Dash 8 planes, with first delivery in 1983. The CTC next approved a joint application of Canavia and City Centre Airways to operate Dash 7 planes between Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal, with the Government of Canada to spend $13.7 million to help establish the service. The service planned to be running by 1984. Metro urged Transport Canada to build a pedestrian tunnel at an estimated cost of $5.5 million, but Transport Canada put off the decision, stating that it would not decide until it saw how well the STOL service operated. In March 1983, the Canavia-City Centre consortium applied to the Government of Canada for $73.5 million in loan guarantees for the project. The firm was eventually given a $20 million loan guarantee, and the consortium made plans to fly between Toronto and Ottawa only, with service to Montreal in a future phase.|$|E

40|$|The {{helicopter}} Microwave Landing System flight-test investigations, {{conducted by}} a joint NASA/FAA effort in order to gather statistical data for establishing terminal instrument procedures criteria, {{and to provide a}} performance data base for developing advanced MLS guidance concepts, are presented. The specific flight-test objectives were to: (1) develop acceptable angle-only MLS approach profiles; (2) determine tracking errors; (3) determine altitude loss during missed approach; (4) evaluate guidance display sensitivities; and (5) evaluate pilot acceptability. Fourteen pilots flew 140 manual (without stability augmentation) dual-pilot simulated instrument approaches in a UH- 1 H helicopter. The flight profiles flown included 3 -, 6 -, and 9 -degree glideslope, centerline approaches to decision heights of 50, 100, and 150 ft, respectively. The angular guidance display sensitivities and the data acquisition system are also described. Eight major conclusions are made, and include the following: (1) the use of pitch attitude to control airspeed and collective to control glideslope was the preferred pilot technique for the steep glideslope approaches, and (2) angular guidance deviation indicator sensitivity requirements for helicopter MLS approaches to <b>STOLports</b> and heliports {{have been found to be}} significantly different from standard ILS sensitivities...|$|R

50|$|A <b>STOLport</b> or <b>STOLPORT</b> was {{an airport}} {{designed}} with STOL (Short Take-Off and Landing) operations in mind, usually for an aircraft class of its weight and size. The term <b>STOLport</b> {{did not appear}} to be in common usage as of 2008. A <b>STOLport</b> normally had a short single runway, in general shorter than 5000 ft. STOLports only accepted certain types of aircraft, often only smaller propeller aircraft, often with limits on the amount of fuel that can be taken. In the United States, short runway facilities are simply known as airports and the term <b>STOLport</b> has not been commonly used since the early 1970s.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, a <b>STOLport</b> is one {{of several}} types of facilities. STOLports are {{identified}} with an S {{at the end of the}} site ID.
