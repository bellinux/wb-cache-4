500|$|In September 2006, Langan made {{a low-key}} {{departure}} from Granada {{to take up}} a position as an executive producer with BBC Films. Although approached to join BBC Films some years before, only in 2007 did <b>she</b> <b>feel</b> it was the time to [...] "concentrate more exclusively on film". She immediately began overseeing editing work on The Other Boleyn Girl, which was already in post-production. She also began developing The Damned United, a film based on David Peace's novel that fictionalised the 44 days Brian Clough managed Leeds United F.C. in 1974. The film was adapted by Peter Morgan, executive produced by Andy Harries, and starred Michael Sheen as Clough. On why she continues to work with the same people on her projects, Langan said, [...] "The reason I return to working with the same people is that you have invested time, energy and thought and care into these relationships and that can pay dividends—The Queen is an example of those relationships paying dividends".|$|E
500|$|Jocelyn Vena from MTV {{believed}} that the video was symbolic and portrayed how [...] "the old Gaga is over, here's the brand-new Gaga: the one who seems to delight in pushing the boundaries and exploring all manner of sexual proclivities". She further {{believed that}} the video was a testament to Gaga's brilliance [...] "as an artist that uses the video art form as the jump-off point for the next leg of their career". In 2011, Claire Suddath of Time said that although later Gaga videos were more elaborate, [...] "Bad Romance" [...] was Gaga at her best. In Lady Gaga: Behind the Fame, Emily Herbert drew comparisons between the underlying theme of the video and the theme of The Fame Monster—the relationship with fame. She wrote, [...] "Was this the price that Gaga {{had to pay for}} the fame she so desired? Did <b>she</b> <b>feel</b> as if she'd had to prostitute herself in some way? The themes were all based around sex, decadence, and corruption; alcohol and even cigarettes, twenty-first century society's biggest no-no, were present, and so by implication ... drugs." [...] The Wall Street Journal noted Gaga {{as one of the few}} pop stars of the present time who really understood spectacle, fashion, shock, choreography—all the things that Madonna and Michael Jackson were masters of in the 1980s.|$|E

50|$|The song is a ballad, with Adelaide {{telling her}} lover how <b>she</b> <b>feels</b> as their {{relationship}} {{comes to an}} end. The lyrics suggest that she will in fact end the relationship the moment the song ends, thus producing the conflicted emotions <b>she</b> <b>feels.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Guilt has a {{great impact}} on Hilde {{throughout}} her life. She feels extreme guilt about the night of the Mühlviertler Hasenjagd and remains haunted by Hannes' words throughout her adulthood. He had said, [...] "'Everyone who doesn't do something against this manhunt makes himself GUILTY.'" [...] Not only through omission does <b>she</b> <b>feel</b> regret for the massacre, but she holds herself personally {{responsible for the deaths of}} the escaped prisoner and of her favorite brother, Hannes. Her guilt plagues her throughout the novel.|$|E
2500|$|While not {{belonging}} to any religion, nor labelling herself as such, Kerli believes in reincarnation {{as well as}} other forms of life after death, fairies (which she has cited as being a large element of her life), angels, and demons, once defining them as [...] "reflections" [...] of one's [...] "inner light" [...] and [...] "inner darkness", respectively. However, besides thanking her guardian angels in the liner notes for Love Is Dead, she has also stated <b>she</b> <b>feel</b> angels are beings, as well as using [...] "angel cards".|$|E
2500|$|Hill was {{the only}} person to testify at the Senate {{hearings}} that there had been unsolicited sexual advances. Angela Wright, who worked under Thomas at the EEOC before he fired her, decided not to testify, but submitted a written statement alleging that Thomas had pressured her for a date and had made comments about the anatomy of women. However, she said she did not feel his behavior was intimidating nor did <b>she</b> <b>feel</b> sexually harassed, though she allowed that [...] "Some other women might have". Also, Sukari Hardnett, a former Thomas assistant, wrote to the Senate committee that although Thomas had not harassed her, [...] "If you were young, black, female and reasonably attractive, you knew full well you were being inspected and auditioned as a female." ...|$|E

50|$|This is {{a second}} {{interpretation}} of the story. The short story begins with a statement that attempts to connect to the reader, and basically all of humanity. Everyone eats and sleeps, therefore the narrator is attempting to come across as normal. However, <b>she</b> <b>feels</b> an unusual connection between sleeping, eating, and sex. In sleep, <b>she</b> <b>feels</b> free and weightless and able to escape reality. In eating, <b>she</b> <b>feels</b> sensual and intimate. In sex, <b>she</b> also <b>feels</b> limitless and liberated, but also {{as if she is}} attached or being held down, suggesting that her morals are pulling her down as she has sex with potential strangers. When the narrator tries to explain these things to him (who could be basically anyone, considering the title), he attempts to comfort her but doesn’t seem to truly listen to her feelings. <b>She</b> still <b>feels</b> as though <b>she</b> is in a shadow, or not truly present.|$|R

He saw Rachel's face distinctly, the grey eyes, the hair, the mouth; the face that could look so many things--plain, vacant, almost insignificant, or wild, passionate, almost beautiful, yet in his eyes was always the same because of the extraordinary freedom with which she looked at him, and spoke as she felt. What would she answer? What did <b>she</b> <b>feel?</b> Did she love him, or did <b>she</b> <b>feel</b> nothing at all for him or for any other man, being, as she had said that afternoon, free, like the wind or the sea? ...|$|E
