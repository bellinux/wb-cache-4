40|$|Abstract: In this paper, a {{two-phase}} flow model {{combined with the}} Realizable k–ε turbulence model was used to simulate hydraulic characteristics of two-type dissipaters: the stepped spillway combined with <b>stilling</b> <b>pool</b> and the stepped spillway combined with wide tailing pier and <b>stilling</b> <b>pool.</b> The distributions of physical parameters, such as velocity field, pressure field, turbulence kinetic energy and turbulence dissipation rate were obtained. The grid was generated by using the regional division method, the unstructured grids used for the irregular and complex parts and the structured grids for the regular and simple parts, and the grid density is arranged according to the flow gradient size. The finite volume method was adopted to discretized the control equations; and the VOF method was adopted {{to deal with the}} free water surface; and the PISO algorithm was used to solve the velocity and pressure coupling equations. A comparative analysis of the two energy-dissipators in the velocity field, pressure field, turbulence kinetic energy and turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rate shows that the dissipation of overflow for a stepped spillway together with wide tailing piers and a <b>stilling</b> <b>pool</b> jointing energy dissipator is better than that with pier situation...|$|E
40|$|This Readiness Assessment Plan {{has been}} {{prepared}} to document operational readiness for the following maintenance action: (1) removal of sediment from the White Oak Creek and Melton Branch Weir <b>Stilling</b> <b>Pools</b> and (2) disposal of the radiologically contaminated sediment in another location upstream of the weirs in an area previously contaminated by stream overflow from Melton Branch in Waste Area Grouping 2 (WAG) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This project is being performed as a maintenance action rather than an action under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act because the risk to human health and environment is well below the US Environmental Protection Agency`s level of concern. The decision to proceed as a maintenance action was documented by an interim action proposed plan, which {{is included in the}} administrative record. The administrative record is available for review at the US Department of Energy Information Resource Center, 105 Broadway Avenue, Oak Ridge, Tennessee 37830...|$|R
40|$|If you {{consciously}} {{take advantage}} of your natural thinking processes by gathering your brain's energies into a "storm, " you can transform these energies into written words or diagrams {{that will lead to}} lively, vibrant writing. Below you will find a brief discussion of what brainstorming is, why you might brainstorm, and suggestions for how you might brainstorm. Whether you are starting with too much information or not enough, brainstorming can help you to put a new writing task in motion or revive a project that hasn't reached completion. Let's take a look at each case: When you've got nothing: You might need a storm to approach when you feel "blank " about the topic, devoid of inspiration, full of anxiety about the topic, or just too tired to craft an orderly outline. In this case, brainstorming stirs up the dust, whips some air into our <b>stilled</b> <b>pools</b> of thought, and gets the breeze of inspiration moving again. When you've got too much: There are times when you have too much chaos in your brain and need to bring in some conscious order. In this case, brainstorming forces the mental chaos and random thoughts to rain out onto the page, giving you some concrete words or schemas that you can then arrange according to their logical relations. Key words: design, brainstorming, preparation 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the numerical studies lead by the Laboratory of Applied Hydrodynamics and Hydraulic Constructions of the University of Liège (HACH) for {{the rehabilitation of}} the 21 -meter high Nisramont dam in Belgium. After determination of the up-to-date 1000 -year return flood using the hydrological runoff model WOLFHYDRO on the global 74, 000 ha watershed real topography coupled with statistical analyzes, and after validation on the existing situation and for extreme observed events, the 2 D finite volume multiblock flow solver WOLF 2 D {{has been applied to}} the design of the new stilling basin and to the bottom outlet rehabilitation impact study. The multiblock solver possibilities allow mesh refinement close to interesting areas, such as dam spillway and <b>stilling</b> <b>pool,</b> without leading to prohibitive CPU times, while suitable shallow water equations formulation allows the computation of the flows on the strongly vertically curved bottom of the spillway. In the described simulation, 270, 000 structured finite volumes, from. 25 to 1 meters long, are used to simulate as a whole the flows in the upstream reservoir, dam, spillway, stilling basin and downstream river, this on a real topography.
