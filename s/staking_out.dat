5|$|The Bearded Man {{demands that}} Fassl kill Fain, beating him {{up when he}} doesn't comply. As she tends to Fassl, Fain first sees the Bearded Man in his place. While <b>staking</b> <b>out</b> Fain's house, the agents see the Bearded Man flee. Doggett pursues the Bearded Man while Reyes finds Fain alive. In the pursuit, Reyes falls through into a sewer, where she finds {{the remains of the}} Bearded Man's victims. After a {{struggle}} with the Bearded Man who is holding Doggett at knife point, Reyes shoots. The Bearded Man falls into the water and Doggett goes after him, only to pull up Fassl, much to his confusion. Reyes tries to remind him that it does not matter as long as the case is solved.|$|E
5|$|Brodeur visits Speranza in his cell, {{and offers}} {{to have his}} death {{sentence}} commuted in exchange for stopping the murders. Speranza takes the offer. That night, Parmelly visits Danielle, who has become agitated since Mulder and Scully have begun <b>staking</b> <b>out</b> her house. The agents now suspect Parmelly to be behind the murders and leave to notify Brodeur, who asks that Parmelly be arrested. Soon afterward, Danielle wakes up to see Neech standing by her room door. She grabs her gun and confronts Parmelly, thinking he is Neech's resurrected form. The agents and a police task force arrive to see her shoot and kill Parmelly. Meanwhile, Brodeurassuming that Charez and Parmelly were on the listthinks Speranza has reneged on their deal and has him taken to the showers. Before Brodeur kills him, Speranza claims that one person remains on the list.|$|E
5|$|Ritter leaves Scully <b>staking</b> <b>out</b> Fellig's apartment, but Scully is unnerved {{when she}} sees Fellig {{shooting}} photos of her out his window and bangs on his door, demanding to know how he took photos {{at a crime scene}} before the police even knew the crime had been committed. He invites her to take a ride with him so he can show her. After driving, he sees a prostitute who appears to be gray to him. Fellig tells Scully that the woman will be dead very soon. A pimp approaches the woman and begins to harass her. Scully leaps out of the car with her gun, announcing that she is an FBI agent and handcuffing the pimp, but when the prostitute tries to flee, she is hit by a truck and killed.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike croquet, both balls must be <b>staked</b> <b>out</b> in {{the same}} turn in order to {{outright}} win the game. By necessity, this requires the first ball to be <b>staked</b> <b>out</b> on a roquet shot and the second ball to be <b>staked</b> <b>out</b> on the ensuing continuation shot. Thus, unlike croquet, one side cannot defensively [...] "stake-out" [...] an opponent's rover in roque.|$|R

During {{a press conference}} that Williams held outside his home to proclaim his innocence, he volunteered that he had failed the polygraph tests — a fact {{that would have been}} inadmissible in court. He was arrested on June 21, 1981, for the murders of Cater and 29-year-old Jimmy Ray Payne.|$|E
25|$|Similar to {{the opening}} of Native American lands in Oklahoma by {{allowing}} acquisition of surplus by non-natives after households received plots, the U.S. government opened the Nez Percé reservation for general settlement on November18, 1895. The proclamation had been signed less than two weeks earlier by President Grover Cleveland. Thousands rushed to grab land on the reservation, <b>staking</b> <b>out</b> their claims even on land owned by Nez Percé families.|$|E
5000|$|Construction {{surveying}} {{or building}} surveying (otherwise known as [...] "staking", [...] "stake-out", [...] "lay-out" [...] or [...] "setting-out") is to <b>stake</b> <b>out</b> reference points and markers that will guide {{the construction of}} new structures such as roads or buildings. These markers are usually <b>staked</b> <b>out</b> according to a suitable coordinate system selected for the project.|$|R

25|$|While {{publisher}} of The Agitator at Home Fox {{became involved in}} two legal controversies. The first involved the sensational Los Angeles Times bombing of 1910, in which 21 people had been killed. Private detective William J. Burns sought the arrest of a former resident of Home Colony, David Caplin, and his associate Matt Schmidt {{in connection with the}} case, believing the two to have been conspirators. Burns established headquarters in Tacoma early in October 1911 and began <b>staking</b> <b>out</b> the house of Jay Fox and searching his mail, convinced that as editor of The Agitator he knew the whereabouts of the two fugitives.|$|E
25|$|The {{areas of}} {{southeast}} Manitoba where Steinbach was later founded, were originally {{lands of the}} nomadic Ojibway-speaking Anishinabe people. They used their traditional lands for hunting, fishing, and trapping. The Anishinabe knew no borders {{at the time and}} their land ranged both north and south of the US–Canada border, and both east and west of the Red River. On 3 August 1871 the Anishinabe people signed Treaty 1 and moved onto reserves such as the Brokenhead Indian Reserve and Roseau River Anishinabe First Nation Reserve. Shortly thereafter the government began surveying and <b>staking</b> <b>out</b> the land for the East Reserve (now the R.M. of Hanover).|$|E
25|$|For {{the moment}} De Witt {{rejected}} Spanish feelers for a defensive alliance against France, {{even when the}} Spanish envoy made an unauthorized threat that Spain would abandon the Southern Netherlands to France, in exchange for Roussillon and Navarre. De Witt recognized this as an empty bluff. As France invaded the Spanish Netherlands in 1667, starting the War of Devolution, De Witt started discussions with Spain, however, in hope of deterring France, and <b>staking</b> <b>out</b> a claim in case Spanish resistance would collapse. Spain received a large Dutch loan, {{with a number of}} Flemish cities as collateral, and De Witt now pointedly obtained permission to occupy these pawns as a guarantee of repayment.|$|E

6000|$|It was {{not until}} the next day that the party {{returned}} to the creek and began to look up the Eclipse Mine once more. The landslide had cut across this, and it was not long before both Wumble and Slim Jim declared the ground to be full of good paying [...] "dirt," [...] to use their own term. The claim was <b>staked</b> <b>out</b> to the boys' satisfaction, and then Wumble <b>staked</b> <b>out</b> a claim just above Discovery, as it is called in mining laws, while Slim Jim <b>staked</b> <b>out</b> one for himself just below Discovery. All three claims ran to both sides of the creek, so that no one would suffer for water when mining operations should begin.|$|R
25|$|One problem plaguing the {{national}} park (as with all the Flinders) is feral goats, which are capable of traversing the rugged stony terrain, and which, thanks {{to the lack of}} predators, flourish. These introduced animals are pests due to the damage their hoofs do to the ground, and the vegetation they consume. The population in {{the national}} park has been reduced by means of hunters <b>staking</b> <b>out</b> waterholes and helicopters picking off animals on the ridge-tops: the help of the local sporting shooters' association has been employed in managing the problem. Undergrowth vegetation has improved markedly in recent years, presumably reflecting reduced numbers. Large-scale baiting programs carried out as part of Operation Bounceback have reduced the number of foxes in {{the national park}}. Rabbit numbers have declined by approximately 85% since the introduction of the rabbit calicivirus.|$|E
500|$|The central pawn {{majority}} is White's main positional trump in the Modern Benoni. By <b>staking</b> <b>out</b> {{an advantage in}} space on the kingside, it allows White to develop an initiative {{on that side of}} the board. The most important tool in White's arsenal is the e4-e5 pawn advance, which can open up lines and squares for the white pieces, and result in the creation of a passed d-pawn if Black answers with ...dxe5.|$|E
500|$|At Elaine's behest, Betts {{removes a}} {{cancerous}} tumor {{from her body}} before summoning an ambulance. The agents, already <b>staking</b> <b>out</b> Elaine's house, encounter the paramedics when they arrive. Scully accompanies Elaine to the hospital while Mulder conducts {{a search of the}} neighborhood. However, after arriving at the hospital, Scully realizes that Betts has stowed himself away {{on the roof of the}} ambulance. Betts locks her inside the ambulance with him, calmly but apologetically telling her that she has [...] "something [...] need." [...] This leads Scully to realize that she herself has cancer. After a struggle, Scully kills Betts by pressing charged defibrillator paddles against his head. Scully remains silently stunned by the revelation of her illness. Later, in her apartment, she wakes up with a nosebleed, confirming her disease.|$|E

500|$|Scholars who {{followed}} Brodie continued to {{chip away at}} the idea of Stevens as a vindictive dictator, who dominated Congress to get his way. In 1960, Eric McKitrick deemed Stevens [...] "a picturesque and adroit politician, but a very limited one" [...] whose career was [...] "a long comic sequence of devilish schemes which, one after another, kept blowing up in his face." [...] From the mid-1970s onward, Foner argued that Stevens's role was in <b>staking</b> <b>out</b> radical position, but events, not Stevens, caused the Republicans to support him. Michael Les Benedict in 1974 suggested that Stevens's reputation as a dictator was based more on his personality than on his influence. In 1989, Allan Bogue found that as chairman of Ways and Means, Stevens was [...] "less than complete master" [...] of his committee.|$|E
500|$|Additionally, Marc N. Kleinheinz at Screen Rant {{discussed}} how the series [...] "continues to resist a status quo", from the destruction and rebuilding of S.H.I.E.L.D., to {{the fallout from}} the Sokovia Accords. He noted that a major driving force behind the changes was the MCU films, with the series being forced [...] "to constantly adapt to a changing narrative landscape that it has absolutely no control over." [...] He also believed that the series was obligated to adapt various Marvel characters to screen which wouldn't be appearing in films, such as Daisy Johnson, Mockingbird, and Ghost Rider. However, Kleinheinz felt that this mindset also came from within the series crew rather than just from Marvel, saying, [...] "there's also the storytelling modus operandi that showrunners Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen have very obviously demonstrated during their four-year tenure. It seems that constantly <b>staking</b> <b>out</b> new ground from season to season is just as much a personal predilection as it is, possibly, a corporate mandate." ...|$|E
500|$|Before it {{was legal}} to claim land in Indian Country, William D. Brown was {{operating}} the Lone Tree Ferry to bring settlers from Council Bluffs, Iowa {{to the area}} that became Omaha. Brown is generally credited as having the first vision for a city where Omaha now sits. The passage of the Kansas–Nebraska Act in 1854 was presaged by the <b>staking</b> <b>out</b> of claims around the area to become Omaha by residents from neighboring Council Bluffs. On July 4, 1854, the city was informally established at a picnic on Capital Hill, current site of Omaha Central High School. Soon after, the Omaha Claim Club was formed to provide vigilante justice for claim jumpers and others who infringed on the land {{of many of the}} city's founding fathers. Some of this land, which now wraps around Downtown Omaha, was later used to entice Nebraska Territorial legislators to an area called Scriptown. The Territorial capitol was located in Omaha, but when Nebraska became a state in 1867, the capital was relocated to Lincoln, [...] south-west of Omaha. The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled against numerous landowners whose violent actions were condemned in Baker v. Morton.|$|E

2500|$|Reports {{of these}} successes spread and in 1863, 150 {{men were in}} the area, among them, James May and the famous [...] "Twelve-foot" [...] Davis who had once made a small fortune by <b>staking</b> <b>out</b> a twelve foot section of ground between two rich claims. However, most of these {{newcomers}} were unsuccessful and, to make matters worse, supplies were scarce. Many prospectors {{had to leave the}} diggings and return to their homes in defeat. Two that stayed on and prospected at Toy's Bar were John Giscome and Henry McDame, both of whom had worked on the Peace, Smoky and Nation Rivers. McDame had made a discovery in the Cassiar district and McDame's Creek was named in his honor.|$|E
2500|$|Not all {{the points}} of this {{traditional}} Thai story can be true as the entire northern campaign took just under five months (23 August 1765 to 20 January 1766). The Burmese chronicles do speak of [...] "petty chiefs" [...] stalling the northern army's advance but it was early in the campaign along the Wang river {{during the rainy season}} (August–October). The Burmese general who was actually stationed near Ayutthaya was not Thihapate but rather Maha Nawrahta, whose southern army waited for about a month for the northern army to show up. It appears that the three verified events—petty chiefs resisting Thihapate in the north, Thihapate's campaign period of five months, and Maha Nawrahta <b>staking</b> <b>out</b> by Ayutthaya—have merged to create this popular mythology.|$|E
2500|$|Apart from {{a handful}} of biologists, the Wild China team were the first to set foot in Tibet’s remote Chang Tang reserve for almost 100 years. After a five-day drive from Lhasa, they were faced with the {{challenge}} of filming rutting chiru in temperatures of -30°C at 5,000m above sea level. The sequence showing a duel between two rival males was successfully filmed after <b>staking</b> <b>out</b> the herds for seven days. Field producer Jeff Boedeker trained with his team for a month in various stealth techniques. On one occasion the field team lay under a white tarp for 32 hours waiting for a shot that never came. They burned yak dung to stay warm and melt drinking water, and the crew was specifically selected for its sensibility to cultures, mental and physical aptitude for high stress scenarios, and techniques in nonfiction filmmaking.|$|E
