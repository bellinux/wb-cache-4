While {{an enormous number of}} indicators for the monitoring of sustainable development exists, few meta-evaluations on these measurements have been conducted in developing countries. Yet, researchers developing new programs face the question: how shall we design our monitoring instrument to respond to the local challenges. By presenting a qualitative meta-performance evaluation of seven <b>sustainability</b> <b>indicator</b> programs on the municipal level in developing countries of Asia, we identify crucial success factors in this contribution. The research draws on 41 expert interviews in Indonesia, Thailand, China, and India, as well as on program-related documents. In the presented case studies, local contexts are intended to be diverse: obtained results should map success factors in different settings. A context-related list of good-practice factors is derived from the interview material via a Qualitative Content Analysis and assessed against the data. We identify crucial strengths and weaknesses of <b>sustainability</b> <b>indicator</b> {{programs in}} six dimensions and link the success factors to their contexts.

40|$|The {{efforts to}} develop {{sustainability}} indicators have strongly increased {{since the beginning of}} the 1990 s, often led by intergovernmental processes. More recently, a number of <b>sustainability</b> <b>indicator</b> development processes have been initiated within large research projects that aim to design tools for sustainability assessments, funded by the European Union. The development of sustainability indicators provides a particular challenge to scientists, given the essentially normative dimension of the concept of "sustainability". Thus, we argue, the development of sustainability indicators is a process of both scientific "knowledge production" and of political "norm creation", and both components need to be properly acknowledged. Based on a respective theoretical framework and comparing five cases of <b>sustainability</b> <b>indicator</b> development processes (three science-led and two led by intergovernmental processes), we fid that the political norm creation dimension is not fully and explicitly recognized in science-led processes.

40|$|Nowadays the {{challenge}} for humanity is to find pathways towards sustainable development. Decision makers require a set of <b>sustainability</b> <b>indicators</b> {{to know if the}} sustainability strategies are following those pathways. There are more than one hundred <b>sustainability</b> <b>indicators</b> but they differ on their relative importance according {{to the size of the}} locality and change on time. The resources needed to follow these <b>sustainability</b> <b>indicators</b> are scarce and in some instances finite, especially in smaller regions. Therefore strategies to select set of these indicators are useful for decision makers responsible for monitoring sustainability. In this paper we propose a model for the identification and selection of a set of <b>sustainability</b> <b>indicators</b> that adequately represents human systems. In developing this model, we applied evolutionary dynamics in a space where <b>sustainability</b> <b>indicators</b> are fundamental entities interconnected by an interaction matrix. we used a fixed interaction that simulates the current context for the city of Cuernavaca, México as an example. We were able to identify and define relevant sets indicators for the system by using the Pareto principle. In this case we identified a set of sixteen <b>sustainability</b> <b>indicators</b> with more than 80 % of the total strength. This set presents resilience to perturbations. For the Tangled Nature framework we provided a manner of treating different contexts (i. e., cities, counties, states, regions, countries, continents or the whole planet), dealing with small dimensions. This model provides decision makers with a valuable tool to select <b>sustainability</b> <b>indicators</b> set for towns, cities, regions, countries, continents or the entire planet according to a coevolutionary framework.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Resource productivity, {{measured}} as GDP output per resource input, {{is a widespread}} <b>sustainability</b> <b>indicator</b> combining economic and environmental information. Resource productivity is ubiquitous, from the IPAT identity {{to the analysis of}} dematerialization trends and policy goals. High resource productivity is interpreted as the sign of a resource-efficient, and hence more sustainable, economy. Its inverse, resource intensity (resource per GDP) has the reverse behavior, with higher values indicating environmentally inefficient economies. In this study, we investigate the global systematic relationship between material, energy and carbon productivities, and economic activity. We demonstrate that different types of materials and energy exhibit fundamentally different behaviors, depending on their international income elasticities of consumption. Biomass is completely inelastic, whereas fossil fuels tend to scale proportionally with income. Total materials or energy, as aggregates, have intermediate behavior, depending on the share of fossil fuels and other elastic resources. We show that a small inelastic share is sufficient for the total resource productivity to be significantly correlated with income. Our analysis calls into question the interpretation of resource productivity as a <b>sustainability</b> <b>indicator.</b> We conclude with suggestions for potential alternatives. The simplicity of the GDP output per resource input ratio makes resource productivity an appealing and widespread en-vironmental <b>sustainability</b> <b>indicator.</b> An abundant literature dis...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} stakeholder {{participation in}} sectoral industry initiatives towards sustainable development, looking in particular at developing a sectoral <b>sustainability</b> <b>indicator</b> set. Indicator sets at the sectoral level {{are crucial to}} promote sustainable business development. They help to consider fundamental differences between distinct industry sectors by drawing a sector specific picture of an industry’s economic, social and environmental impacts. In this way sectoral indicators are a prerequisite for appropriate measurement and systematic management of an industry sector’s sustainability performance. Additionally, a sectoral approach provides the opportunity to link sustainability initiatives at a macro-economic level (e. g. by the European Commission, Eurostat, the OECD, the German Enquete Commission of Inquiry) with those at the micro-economic level (GRI, AA 2000, SA 8000, ISO 14001, CSR Europe). A methodology, called COMPASS, is presented which illustrates how industry can interact with different stakeholders (scientists, {{members of the public}} and regulators) in order to develop a <b>sustainability</b> <b>indicator</b> set for an industry sector.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. Poverty is a {{big problem}} and has a huge impact on South Africa. The problem of poverty is multi-dimensional and has many facets and levels. One of the {{strategies}} used to alleviate poverty is through income-generating community projects. This study focuses on the Holding Hands income-generating community projects in the North-West Province. <b>Sustainability</b> <b>indicators</b> have previously been developed for these projects. The aim of this study was the evaluation of the <b>sustainability</b> <b>indicators</b> used in the projects. The evaluation focused on a quantitative analysis of the new and previously identified <b>sustainability</b> <b>indicators.</b> The entire population was included in the study. The research instrument consisted of a semi-structured quantitative questionnaire that had been specifically designed for this study. The frequency distribution provided the researcher with a profile of a typical member of the Holding Hands community projects, a definition of sustainability for these projects and a ranking {{of the importance of the}} different <b>sustainability</b> <b>indicators</b> in the Holding Hands projects. Tests for correlation were conducted among the variables age and level of education and the definitions of sustainability, as well as the <b>sustainability</b> <b>indicators.</b> T-Tests were conducted to evaluate if the different geographical areas answered the questions differently. The open-ended questions provided insight into the views of the participants on the sustainability of the projects. The results of the evaluation process indicated that the top five <b>sustainability</b> <b>indicators</b> in the project now focus on the evaluation and development of human capital in the projects. The results of the evaluation process differ substantially from the previously developed <b>sustainability</b> <b>indicators</b> and this suggests progress towards the sustainability of the projects. The results of the evaluation process would be used to plan and develop future interventions in the Holding Hands income-generating projects. The limitations of the study included the lack of research on the topic, as well as the language and literacy barriers in the data collection process. This study contributes to the relief of poverty in South Africa through research on the sustainability of income-generating community projects. Master...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{sustainability}} has gained traction within Canadian planning efforts in recent years. As such, {{there is a}} need to measure progress toward sustainability goals; it was found that sustainability indicators are the recommended tool to perform such measurement. The literature also articulated the potential for core community sustainability indicators. The concept of transferability was produced to describe the ability of indicators, domains, and scoring processes to be relevant between communities (horizontal transferability) and various levels of governance (vertical transferability). Hence, the objectives of this research were to create a set of community sustainability indicators, domains, and a scoring methodology for use in a Canadian Community <b>Sustainability</b> <b>Indicator</b> Framework. In attempt to achieve these objectives, first a document review of four existing Canadian community <b>sustainability</b> <b>indicator</b> sets and their domains. This review produced a preliminary set of community sustainability indicators and domains, the latter of which were used in the interviews that followed. The document review also introduced a scoring methodology from MMM Group: The Complete Mobility (CM) scoring methodology. Interview communities were chosen from across Canada using criteria to include different geographical areas, community sizes, and economic/population conditions. Interviewees were from academic, government, or non-government organizations. Interviews followed a loose interview guide with the objectives of gaining insight into interviewee perceptions on sustainability indicators, domains, and scoring processes. Specifically they were asked to evaluate the preliminary set of community <b>sustainability</b> <b>indicator</b> domains and CM scoring methodology, both found in the document review.

Past and recent experiences have shown that <b>sustainability</b> <b>indicators</b> can be powerful tools for measuring the outcomes of various interventions, when used appropriately and adequately. Currently, there is a range of methods for applying <b>sustainability</b> <b>indicators</b> for project impact evaluation at the environment–development interface. At the same time, a number of challenges persist which have implication for impact evaluation processes especially in developing countries. We highlight some key and recurrent challenges, using three cases from Kenya, Indonesia and Brazil. In this study, we have conducted a comparative analysis across multiple projects from the three countries, which aimed to conserve biodiversity and improve livelihoods. The assessments of these projects were designed to evaluate their positive, negative, short-term, long term, direct and indirect impacts. We have identified a set of commonly used <b>sustainability</b> <b>indicators</b> to evaluate the projects and have discussed opportunities and challenges associated with their application. Our analysis shows that impact evaluation processes present good opportunities for applying <b>sustainability</b> <b>indicators.</b> On the other hand, we find that project proponents (e. g. managers, evaluators, donors/funders) face challenges with establishing full impacts of interventions and that these are rooted in monitoring and evaluation processes, lack of evidence-based impacts, difficulties of measuring certain outcomes and concerns over scale {{of a range of}} impacts.
