5|$|During the VB's development, Holden {{realised}} {{that when}} driven at speed over harsh Australian roads, the Rekord would effectively break in half at the firewall. This forced Holden {{to rework the}} entire car for local conditions, resulting in only 35percent commonality with the Opel. The Rekord's MacPherson strut front suspension was accordingly modified, and the recirculating ball steering was replaced with a rack and pinion type. These modifications blew development costs beyond expectations to a reported —a figure close {{to the cost of}} developing a new model independently. With such a large sum consumed by the VB development programme, Holden was left with insufficient finances to resource the development of a wagon variant. Added that the Commodore architecture was considered an unsuitable base for utility and long-wheelbase models, Holden was left with only a sedan, albeit one in three levels of luxury: a base, SL, and SL/E. Desperate measures forced Holden to shape the Commodore front-end {{to the rear of the}} Rekord wagon. As the wagon-specific sheet metal had to be imported from Germany, the wagon, introduced in July 1979, suffered from inevitable component differences from the sedan. Although infrequently criticised in the early years, quality problems were evident, with poor trim and panel fit problematic for all first generation Commodores. This coupled with mechanical dilemmas such as water pump failure and <b>steering</b> <b>rack</b> rattle ensured warranty claims were high in the first year. In face of these issues, VB was praised for its value for money and sophistication, especially in regards to the steering, ride quality, handling and brakes, thus securing the Wheels Car of the Year award for 1978.|$|E

25|$|In late 1962 Alan Turner, AC's chief {{engineer}} completed a major design {{change of the}} car's front end to accommodate {{rack and pinion steering}} while still using transverse leaf spring suspension. The new car entered production in early 1963 and was designated Mark II. The <b>steering</b> <b>rack</b> was borrowed from the MGB while the new steering column came from the VW Beetle. About 528 Mark II Cobras were produced in the summer of 1965 (the last US-bound Mark II was produced in November 1964).|$|E
25|$|For the 2006 {{model year}} (launched in late 2005) Lamborghini {{introduced}} many {{changes to the}} car to counter some criticisms garnered from the press and owners. These {{were based on the}} limited edition Gallardo SE. The exhaust system was changed to a more sporty one (including a flap to make it quieter around town), the suspension was revised, a new <b>steering</b> <b>rack</b> was fitted, the engine power was increased by 20bhp to a maximum of , and the biggest change was an overall lowering of the gearing, especially in 1st to 5th. The result was a much improved car: it handled and turned better, sounded better under full throttle and the extra power and lower gearing made an already fast car into a much faster one.|$|E
25|$|At {{the first}} race in Argentina, {{he felt the}} car was {{difficult}} to handle and on a fast lap, the front wing became detached striking his helmet. In the race, Hunt retired due to an electrical fault. In Brazil, he retired on lap 6 due to instability under braking caused by a loose <b>steering</b> <b>rack.</b> During qualifying in South Africa, the brakes on his car failed. He managed not to collide with the wall, but only finished 8th in the race. He retired at the Spanish Grand Prix after 26 laps. At Zolder, a new Wolf WR8 was raced but Hunt crashed into a barrier hard enough to bounce back onto the track. After failing to finish the 1979 Monaco Grand Prix, the race where six years previously {{he had made his}} debut, Hunt made a statement on 8 June 1979 to the press announcing his immediate retirement from F1 competition, citing his situation in the championship. Despite going into retirement, he continued to work to promote his personal sponsors Marlboro and Olympus.|$|E

25|$|The 2007 {{model year}} {{marked the first}} time the S2000 was offered in more than one trim level in the United States. In {{addition}} to the base model, Honda offered a more track-oriented version of the S2000, distinguished by reduced weight, fewer amenities, and an increase in performance. The S2000 Club Racer made its world debut at the New York International Auto Show on 4 April 2007. Changes for the CR included a lower ratio <b>steering</b> <b>rack,</b> revised exhaust system, black lug nuts, darker colored wheels, clear side markers, stiffer suspension and new Bridgestone Potenza RE070 tires that were wider at the rear; 245/40R-17 to 255/40R-17. A revised body kit, composed of a redesigned front lip, and a large spoiler, were wind-tunnel tested and claimed to reduce the overall coefficient of lift by 70–80%. The power folding soft top was removed and replaced with additional chassis bracing topped off with a tonneau cover, while the hard top, optional on other models, became a standard feature on the CR. Honda also revised the shift knob over the base with an exclusive spherical aluminum shift knob that rests 12.6mm lower for a 6 percent reduction in shift stroke compared to the conventional S2000 cylindrical shift knob (aluminum/leather wrapped). Conversely, the shift load effort increased by 10 percent with the new design.|$|E
25|$|Bathurst {{would prove}} to be a {{disaster}} for the team. In the race, the British built Commodore with Tom Walkinshaw driving lasted only 5 laps before retiring with rear suspension failure after a pit stop where the left rear wheel changer was lucky not to be seriously injured when the car was let off its onboard air jacks too early. The Perkins/Hulme car qualified inside the top 10 (the only V8 to do so) and ran strongly in second or third place for most of the race until engine failure on lap 137. However, the real drama started at the end of official qualifying when Walkinshaw put in a protest against the fastest Sierra's (only the Australian built examples). This was counter protested by Dick Johnson Racing team manager Neal Lowe (who had taken over Perkins old role as race engineer/driver at the HDT in 1986) who protested all three HSV team cars. While the Sierra's were all eventually cleared, two of the three HSV team cars, the two built by Perkins in Australia, were found to have illegal modifications to the Commodore's <b>steering</b> <b>rack</b> and were disqualified, though as one car had been withdrawn before qualifying and the Perkins/Hulme/Walkinshaw race car had failed to finish (Walkinshaw invoked a clause in the teams contract which forced a reluctant Perkins to let him drive the car in the race), the race results were not altered to show the disqualification. The DQ of the Perkins built cars raised some eyebrows from his fellow competitors as Larry had been vocal throughout the 1988 ATCC about the legality of the Sierra's and had been pushing for the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport to enforce Group A rules.|$|E
500|$|The {{suspension}} {{was entirely}} new, adding adjustable anti-roll bars. [...] The brakes were redesigned {{to adapt the}} use of a driver-adjustable brake pressure balance, while the servo-activated braking system was removed. [...] A racing <b>steering</b> <b>rack</b> was used in place of the standard power steering unit. [...] Pneumatic jacks were later added to the cars in the 1980 season to allow for quicker pit stops. [...] Goodyear racing tires were used on all cars. [...] All other non-essential items from the road car were not included, bringing the Procar M1's weight down to [...] [...] The performance of the Procar M1s was increased to a top speed of [...] dependent upon gear ratios, and acceleration from 0– in 4.3seconds. [...] Each Procar M1 cost approximately US$60,000.|$|E
50|$|Similar gaiters {{to those}} {{described}} above find multiple uses on most vehicles. They are used {{at both ends}} of driveshafts, protecting constant-velocity joints from the ingress of dirt, and retaining the grease. They also prevent the ingress of dirt where one component slides within another, for example, on suspension struts or the ends of <b>steering</b> <b>racks.</b> Finally, they are also usually used to perform the same function on ball joints, which appear on suspension wishbones and steering tie rod ends. The gear stick gaiter is to resist dirt entering the ball joint {{at the bottom of the}} stick and to not have oil or grease from the joint exposed to passengers. They are commonly leather, faux leather, rubber or a waterproof cloth.|$|R

2500|$|The 2009 sport package (standard on Sport 6MT cars, {{optional}} on Journey and X models) {{now also}} included larger sport brakes with 4-piston front/2-piston rear calipers with [...] ventilated front rotors and [...] ventilated rear rotors, a new sport wheel design [...] for the Sedan and [...] on the Coupe, and Viscous Limited-Slip Differential (VLSD). The Sport Package on G37 x AWD Sedans {{does not include}} the larger opposed piston brakes, nor does it include the more aggressive <b>steering</b> <b>rack,</b> VLSD, or sport tuned suspension (the same package for AWD Coupes includes everything from the RWD version, save the more aggressive <b>steering</b> <b>rack).</b> Brakes on non-Sport models are front [...] ventilated discs and rear [...] ventilated discs with sliding calipers.

2500|$|However, the car {{attracted}} {{criticism from}} the motoring press at launch due to its suspension, with positive camber on the front wheels and negative camber at the rear, giving rise to the Mark III's infamous [...] "knock-kneed" [...] stance. The Mark III soon {{had a reputation for}} a harsh, unforgiving ride. In 1983 the revised suspension mounts from the Escort-based Orion and the larger Sierra <b>steering</b> <b>rack</b> were introduced as running changes for the 1984 model year which also coincided with a minor update for it including a new Escort badge at the rear.|$|E
50|$|In {{an ironic}} twist, the DJR protest against {{two of the}} three HSV team cars (only the Perkins built cars and not the TWR British built Walkinshaw/Jeff Allam car) was {{successful}} with the modifications made to the cars <b>steering</b> <b>racks</b> found to be illegal. Ultimately the Australian Racing Drivers Club saw no need to change the results to show the cars as disqualified as the spare HSV Car (#40) was only driven in Wednesday's practice session, while the Larry Perkins/Denny Hulme/Walkinshaw #10 car, as well as the #20 Walkinshaw/Allam car both failed to finish. The fact that the Perkins built cars were disqualified and the Sierras were cleared raised some eyebrows as during the 1988 Australian Touring Car Championship Larry Perkins had been vocal that the Sierras were running illegally and was pushing for CAMS to enforce the rules.|$|R

2500|$|In 2006, Caterham {{introduced}} the CSR Superlight. Based on the CSR260, this model adds a ‘Superlight’ lightweight specification to the CSR, further extending the CSR260’s already epic performance envelope.

Of particular note are ‘Dynamic Suspensions’ Damper units developed by specialist Multimatic for the car. The damper units lend the already capable CSR a further edge in terms of handling and cornering performance. It features the same 2.3 litre (260bhp) engine as the CSR260, but weighs only [...] and has a power-to-weight ratio of -per-tonne.|$|E
2500|$|On 25 January 2011, Aston Martin {{released}} the V8 Vantage S, available in both coupe and Roadster variants, {{and designed to}} produce a more sporty experience than the standard V8 Vantage. The engine is the same 4.7-liter aluminum V-8 found in the base Vantage, but with improved intake airflow, new mufflers, and new programming that keeps the exhaust system’s bypass valves open longer. The net is 430hp and 361lb-ft of torque, gains of 10hp and 15lb-ft. The improvements mean it goes from 0 to 60mph in 4.0 seconds, 0.3 seconds faster than the base model. Engine output flows through a new single-clutch seven-speed Graziano automated manual to a limited-slip rear differential; the carbon fiber driveshaft spins in an aluminum torque tube. From there, power {{is applied to the}} pavement via a set of(285/35) Bridgestone Potenzas on 19-inch cast aluminum wheels. Bushings, springs, and dampers were stiffened for the S model and the <b>steering</b> <b>rack</b> is quicker than in the base model. The result of all these put together is an exceptional level of response. The aerodynamic enhancements include a deeper front bumper with carbon fibre splitter, larger side sills, a carbon fibre diffuser and a larger tailgate lip designed to sharpen the handling on the road. [...] Additional visual differences include new wheels.|$|E
2500|$|Australian driver Colin Bond, {{winner of}} the 1975 Australian Touring Car Championship and 1969 Hardie-Ferodo 500, had been racing the GTV6 model since 1984 and stayed loyal to Alfa Romeo, running a Caltex {{sponsored}} Alfa 75 in the 1987 Australian Touring Car Championship to replace the GTV6. Bond's new 75 was built by the Italian Luigi team, but Bond found the engine it came with only produced about [...] instead of the 320 bhp it should have. This saw him finish a distant 9th place in the championship while the team's engine builder, Melbourne based Alfa expert tuner Joe Beninca, tried to claw back the extra power. This was achieved after the car was converted to right hand drive which allowed an exhaust system to be fitted that didn't wind its way around the <b>steering</b> <b>rack.</b> Bond also drove the end of season endurance races which included the Bathurst round of the WTCC. After Bond qualified the car in 21st, co-driver Lucio Cesario destroyed {{the front of the}} 75 in a crash {{at the top of the}} mountain on lap 34 of the race which forced the cars withdrawal from the Calder Park and Wellington rounds of the WTCC. The car was repaired in time for the Australian Grand Prix support races in Adelaide where Bond qualified a fine second and finished 5th in the race in the cars 'down under' swansong as Bond, the only driver to embrace the 75 in Australia, switched to race the all-conquering Ford Sierra RS500 from 1988 in a bid to return to the winners circle.|$|E
50|$|The {{suspension}} mounting provided more isolation by incorporating flexible rubber links. Progressive rebound bumpers were adopted, while the damper rates, {{front and rear}} toe-in and the relative angle between springs and dampers have all been altered.
