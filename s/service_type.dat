25|$|The S.E.5a was by {{this time}} already in production, and was proving itself an {{excellent}} <b>service</b> <b>type</b> – it was however in chronically short supply, and this situation {{could only have been}} exacerbated by an attempt to introduce a new type that would have competed with it for production facilities (Austins already had a large SE.5a contract) and engines (since both fighters used the Hispano-Suiza 8, of which there was at this stage a severe shortage). The A.F.B.1 therefore had no real chance of being accepted for a production order.|$|E

40|$|PROCESS Let's review where we've been. Remember that we {{suggested}} the following sequence of steps as your process or methodology for planning or assessing rural transportation services? 1. Review the <b>service</b> <b>types</b> that are available. 2. Establish local goals, objectives, and needs {{based on your}} community and its profile. 3. Select and tailor services to reflect community needs. 4. Estimate the volume of service anticipated. 5. Evaluate available resources and forecast funding and service costs. 6. Refer to other sources for help in refining the service design. We explored some basic service definitions in Chapter 2 and looked at examples of <b>service</b> <b>types</b> in the real world. Chapter 3 examined the various issues to be considered when deciding which <b>type</b> of <b>service</b> to select, including local goals and objectives, {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of various <b>service</b> <b>types,</b> taking advantage of community characteristics, how much service to offer, how much service you can afford, and special considerations about <b>service</b> <b>types</b> and combinations of types (steps 2 through 5 above). Chapter 4 highlighted examples of rural transit operations that are successfully tailored to local circumstances and conditions. Chapter 5 was the big numbers chapter: in-depth numerical details of the various <b>service</b> <b>types.</b> You may now want to delve into the detailed statistical information about the relative performance levels of the different <b>service</b> <b>types.</b> Further detailed information about the characteristics and performance levels of the various rural transportation <b>service</b> <b>types</b> is provided in Appendix D. We suggest that you go farther than that. If you are really interested in customized perspectives of how the <b>service</b> <b>types</b> fit into communities of various characteristics, we recommend that you use the Rural Transportation Services computer program (described in Appendix A) to generate unique peer comparisons to your own locality. The program is available through the Transit Cooperative Researc...|$|R

25|$|MBTA Boat {{services}} {{have the highest}} farebox recovery ratio of any MBTA <b>service</b> <b>type,</b> at 55% by a 2012 report. However, the service still operates at a $5 million annual loss to the MBTA and carries a relatively small percentage of passengers, which has resulted in calls for its discontinuance or modification. In 2012, facing a substantial budget gap, the MBTA proposed substantial service cuts and fare increases. All ferry routes were to be cut, resulting in $3.7 million savings for the agency. Temporary measures were found to avoid some service cuts including the ferries; however, weekend Quincy service was eliminated and fares raised 35% {{in an attempt to}} eliminate the subsidy required. State lawmakers also then proposed that Massport take over the ferries from the MBTA.|$|E
25|$|Retailing {{services}} may {{also include the}} provision of credit, delivery services, advisory services, exchange/ return services, product demonstration, special orders, customer loyalty programs, limited-scale trial, advisory services {{and a range of}} other supporting services. Retail stores often seek to differentiate along customer service lines. For example, some department stores offer the services of a stylist; a fashion advisor, to assist customers selecting a fashionable wardrobe for the forthcoming season, while smaller boutiques may allow regular customers to take goods home on approval, enabling the customer to try out goods before making the final purchase. The variety of supporting services offered is known as the <b>service</b> <b>type.</b> At one end of the spectrum, self-service operators offer few basic support services. At {{the other end of the}} spectrum, full-service operators offer a broad range of highly personalised customer services to augment the retail experience.|$|E

Data from 1, 333 NSD projects were analyzed to empirically derive a service typology and examine if and how different <b>types</b> of <b>services</b> vary in terms of NSD resources, practices, methods, and results. Findings Based on six service characteristics, the study identifies four service types: routine-intensive, technology-intensive, contact-intensive, and knowledge-intensive services. The study also identifies specific NSD resources, practices, methods, and results that are prevalent across the service typology. The evidence indicates that the use of advanced practices and methods differs dramatically between <b>service</b> <b>types.</b> Practical implications The paper enables practitioners to expand their current understanding on NSD by providing insights into the variability of NSD across <b>service</b> <b>types.</b> The results suggest that either service-type-specific models or a configurable model for NSD should be developed.
