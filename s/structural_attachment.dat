Carbon / Carbon (C/C) composites are well proven, functionally, for repeated use in re-entry missions. A re-entry capsule with sphere-cone-flare external shape, currently under realisation, will fly with C/C Thermal Protection System (TPS) in its peak heating region. The biggest challenge in design {{of such a}} reusable hot structure TPS is the management of thermo-structural loads.

Testing specifically focused {{on the effects of}} penetrations (including <b>structural</b> <b>attachments,</b> electrical conduit/feedthroughs, and fluid lines) through MLI. While there have been attempts at quantifying these losses both analytically and experimentally, none have included a thorough investigation of the methods and materials {{that could be used in}} such applications.

The parameters varied were the attachment mechanism, the buffer material (for buffer attachment mechanisms only), the thickness of the buffer, and the penetration material. The work done under this task is an attempt to measure the parasitic heat loads and affected insulation areas produced by system integration, to model the parasitic loads, and from the model produce engineering equations to allow for the determination of parasitic heat loads in future applications. The methods of integration investigated were no integration, using a buffer to thermally isolate the strut from the MLI, and temperature matching the MLI on the strut.

30|$|The dye {{that is used}} as a {{photosensitizer}} {{plays an}} important role in the operation of DSSCs. The function of dye is to absorb light, inject electrons from the redox mediator. Light harvesting dyes absorb solar radiation incident which results in the excitation of molecules, which pass the energy obtained by means of transferring electrons onto a nanocrystalline semiconductor substrate onto which they are adsorbed. The efficiency of the cell is critically dependent on the absorption spectrum of the dye and its anchorage on the surface of the semiconductor. Much work has concentrated on organic dyes and organic metal complexes. On the other hand, natural dyes extracted from fruits and flowers have attracted the attention of many researchers [14], and many natural dyes have been proven to be efficient dyes as photo-sensitizers in DSSCs. Natural dye is readily available and cheap, thus, making it environmental friendly with potential capacity to reduce the cost of DSSC devices. In particular, Laali, as popularly called, is grown in the savannah region of West Africa [15] and are used as colouring material in the designing of fashionable tattoos on human bodies.

40|$|ABSTRACT: For years, civil {{engineers}} {{have been in}} search for alternatives to steels and alloys to combat {{the high costs of}} repair and maintenance of structures damaged by corrosion and heavy use. In recent years there has been a marked increase in the use of fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) as structural elements in bridge construction. This is attributed to the advantageous properties of these materials, such as high strength to weight ratio, possibility of producing any shape, their high resistance to corrosion and fatigue, and easy maintenance. The current study utilizes the advancements in the three dimensional weaving technology in developing an innovative FRP deck system that satisfy AASHTO HS- 20 performance specifications. This paper presents fiber reinforced polymeric bridge decks that utilize an innovative textile engineering 3 -D weaving technology to overcome the weaknesses of its predecessors. The produced panels encompassed continuity of reinforcing fibers in both the top and bottom skins as well as between the outer skin and the inner core. The primary in-plane fiber reinforcement is uncrimped due to the orientation of the weaving. The 3 -D fibers perform as through thickness reinforcement, provide additional resistance to crack propagation and eliminate delamination as a failure mode. The feasibility and implications of using the 3 -D weaving process for FRP bridge decks is demonstrated by testing three woven glass FRP bridge deck slabs under static loading conditions. Test results exemplified the importance of the <b>structural</b> <b>attachment</b> of the core components to the outer composite deck skins and demonstrated resistance of delamination of the core to the outer skins and within the skins...|$|E
40|$|Under {{the joint}} {{sponsorship}} of the Department of Energy and NASA, a radioisotope power system utilizing Stirling power conversion technology is being developed for potential future space missions. The higher conversion efficiency of the Stirling cycle {{compared with that of}} Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) used in previous missions (Viking, Pioneer, Voyager, Galileo, Ulysses, Cassini, and New Horizons) offers the advantage of a four-fold reduction in PuO 2 fuel, thereby saving cost and reducing radiation exposure to support personnel. With the advancement of state-of-the-art Stirling technology development under the NASA Research Announcement (NRA) project, the Stirling Radioisotope Generator program has evolved to incorporate the advanced Stirling convertor (ASC), provided by Sunpower, into an engineering unit. Due to the reduced envelope and lighter mass of the ASC compared to the previous Stirling convertor, the specific power of the flight generator is projected to increase from 3. 5 to 7 We/kg, along with a 25 percent reduction in generator length. Modifications are being made to the ASC design to incorporate features for thermal, mechanical, and electrical integration with the engineering unit.

40|$|Introduction: Achieving NASA's Space Exploration Vision {{scientific}} objectives {{will require}} human access into cratered and uneven terrain {{for the purpose}} of sample acquisition to assess geological, and perhaps even biological features and experiments. Operational risk management is critical to safely conduct the anticipated tasks. This strategy, along with associated contingency plans, will be a driver of EVA system requirements. Therefore, a medical contingency EVA scenario was performed with the Haughton-Mars Project/NASA to develop belay and medical evacuation techniques for exploration and rescue respectively. Methods: A rescue system to allow two rescuer astronauts to evacuate one in incapacitated astronaut was evaluated. The systems main components were a hard-bottomed rescue litter, hand-operated winch, rope, ground picket anchors, and a rover-winch attachment adapter. Evaluation was performed on 15 - 25 deg slopes of dirt with embedded rock. The winch was anchored either by adapter to the rover or by pickets hammered into the ground. The litter was pulled over the surface by rope attached to the winch. Results: The rescue system was utilized effectively to extract the injured astronaut up a slope and to a waiting rover for transport to a simulated habitat for advanced medical care, although several challenges to implementation were identified and overcome. Rotational stabilization of the winch was found to be important to get maximize mechanical advantage from the extraction system. Discussion: Further research and testing needs to be performed to be able to fully consider synergies with the other Exploration surface systems, in conducting contingency operations. <b>Structural</b> <b>attachment</b> points on the surface EVA suits may be critical to assist in incapacitated evacuation. Such attach points could be helpful in microgravity incapacitated crewmember transport as well. Wheeled utility carts or wheels that may be attachable to a litter may also aid in extraction and transport. Utilizing parts of the rover (e. g. seats) to deploy as a litter may be considered.

Labeled red blood cells were co-precipitated with avidin beads to indicate the presence of band 3. (ii) Fluorescence microscopy images were collected by incubating the cells in the presence and the absence of linker. RBC appears only in the fluorescents field of the specimen which is incubated with linker.

Mass analysis, based upon the integration of electron scattering intensities for unstained particles, gave a molecular weight of 1. 95 (+/-) 0. 24) megadaltons. Mass per unit length analysis was performed using bovine brain microtubules decorated with dynein under conditions where the dynein shows a linear repeat of 24 nm with seven dynein molecules surrounding a microtubule made up of 14 protofilaments. Undecorated microtubules gave a molecular weight per unit length of 21, 000 +/- 1, 900 daltons/A, compared to a value of 84, 400 +/- 2, 200 daltons/A for the fully decorated microtubules. Taken together, these data give a molecular weight of 2. 17 (+/- 0. 14) megadaltons per dynein molecule, in agreement with measurements on the isolated particles. Mass analysis of individual globular heads observed in isolated particles gave a molecular weight distribution with a mean of 416 +/- 76 kdaltons. These data could also be viewed as the sum of two populations of head with two-thirds of the heads at approximately 400 kdaltons and one-third at approximately 550 kdaltons, although more precise data will be required to distinguish two classes of heads with confidence. The mass of the dynein-microtubule complex as a function of distance from the midline of the particle was analysed to distinguish which end of the dynein molecule was bound to the microtubule. The projected mass distribution was consistent with a model where the three dynein heads were oriented toward the microtubule and clearly not consistent with the opposite orientation. These data indicate that the three globular heads form the ATP-sensitive site in this heterologous dynein-microtubule system and suggest that the rootlike base of the dynein molecule forms the <b>structural</b> <b>attachment</b> site to the A-subfiber of the outer doublet in cilia and flagella. The structure and function of the dynein are dicussed in terms of these new results...|$|E
40|$|The {{positions}} of preferential DNA {{interaction with the}} nuclear matrix were mapped within {{the domain of the}} chicken alpha-globin genes in transcriptionally active erythroblast nuclei and inactive nuclei of mature erythrocytes. In the latter, only two major distinct attachment sites were observed, close to the A + T-rich sequences previously found at the boundaries of the domain. Sequencing of these <b>structural</b> matrix <b>attachment</b> points revealed several known DNA motifs; some of them were present {{on both sides of the}} domain. In actively transcribing erythroblast nuclei of adult animals, a large fraction of the transcribed area was represented in nuclear matrix DNA, including upstream and downstream elements. In particular, adult alpha A- and alpha D-globin genes were found in matrix DNA, while the transcribed but translationally unexpressed embryonic pi gene was underrepresented. The data are discussed in terms of the existence of stable or structural and expression-related matrix attachment sites; correlations to the origin of replication and the units of transcription of the domain are shown...|$|R
40|$|AbstractReattachment {{and healing}} of tendon to bone poses a {{persistent}} clinical challenge and {{often results in}} poor outcomes, {{in part because the}} mechanisms that imbue the uninjured tendon-to-bone attachment with toughness are not known. One feature of typical tendon-to-bone surgical repairs is direct attachment of tendon to smooth bone. The native tendon-to-bone attachment, however, presents a rough mineralized interface that might serve an important role in stress transfer between tendon and bone. In this study, we examined the effects of interfacial roughness and interdigital stochasticity on the strength and toughness of a bimaterial interface. Closed form linear approximations of the amplification of stresses at the rough interface were derived and applied in a two-dimensional unit-cell model. Results demonstrated that roughness may serve to increase the toughness of the tendon-to-bone insertion site at the expense of its strength. Results further suggested that the natural tendon-to-bone attachment presents roughness for which the gain in toughness outweighs the loss in strength. More generally, our results suggest a pathway for stochasticity to improve surgical reattachment strategies and <b>structural</b> engineering <b>attachments...</b>|$|R
2500|$|The ET was the [...] "backbone" [...] of {{the shuttle}} during launch, {{providing}} <b>structural</b> support for <b>attachment</b> with the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) and orbiter. The tank was connected to each SRB at one forward attachment point (using a crossbeam through the intertank) and one aft bracket, and it {{was connected to the}} orbiter at one forward attachment bipod and two aft bipods. In the aft attachment area, there were also umbilicals that carried fluids, gases, electrical signals and electrical power between the tank and the orbiter. Electrical signals and controls between the orbiter and the two solid rocket boosters were also routed through those umbilicals.|$|R
