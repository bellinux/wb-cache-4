40|$|A {{probe system}} for {{monitoring}} chemical activity {{of a target}} chemical in an environment has first and <b>second</b> <b>marker</b> compounds each bonded to a common substrate to keep the respective markers in physical proximity. The first marker is a chemical that has a maximum emission intensity at a first wavelength, and it is chemically shielded from the environment being studied. The <b>second</b> <b>marker</b> is a chemical that, when in a first state, has a maximum emission intensity at a second wavelength different from the first wavelength and which, in a second state, {{does not have a}} maximum emission intensity at the second wavelength. The <b>second</b> <b>marker</b> is convertible between said states through chemical reaction with the target chemical. The common substrate is a carrier particle, the first marker being impregnated within the carrier particle and the <b>second</b> <b>marker</b> being chemically bonded to the exterior surface of the carrier particle. The carrier particle may be a polymeric material, such as polystyrene, especially formed into a microsphere. The <b>second</b> <b>marker</b> may be in the second state prior to chemical reaction with the target chemical and is converted to the first state after chemical reaction with the target chemical, or it may be in the first state prior to chemical reaction with the target chemical, convertible to the second state by the chemical reaction with the target chemical.

5000|$|With renewed purpose, Flynn deciphers {{the clues}} {{on the first}} marker, which takes him to the tomb of Marie Laveau, the [...] "voodoo queen" [...] of New Orleans, and he discovers the <b>second</b> <b>marker,</b> only to be ambushed by Kubichek's men. Once taken into custody, and {{revealing}} that he speaks Russian, Kubichek questions Flynn about the marker. Flynn refuses to break under interrogation, claiming that Kubichek will need him to solve the other clues. Kubichek reveals the kidnapped Professor Lazlo to Flynn as the expert guiding his expedition. Flynn reluctantly admits that Kubichek could kill him and find the chalice with only Lazlo's help. In response, Flynn is poisoned with a hallucinogenic compound {{so that they can}} blame his death on an accident. Before it kicks in, Flynn escapes his binds (while citing a book on Harry Houdini,) and attempts to release Professor Lazlo. The two examine the <b>second</b> <b>marker</b> and, working in nearly perfect synchrony, decipher the <b>second</b> <b>marker's</b> clues. Unfortunately, the hallucinogen begins to take effect before Flynn can free the professor, who encourages Flynn to leave without him since his handicap will only slow them down.|$|R
50|$|On July 15, 1956, the Fandango Pass {{section of}} the Applegate-Lassen Emigrant Trail became California Historical Landmark No. 546.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{whether the}} duration of two successive short sounds can affect {{the perception of the}} time interval marked by the onsets of these sounds. An experiment was conducted using marker durations of 20 to 100 ms and inter-onset time intervals of 120, 240, and 360 ms. The effects of marker duration were summarized as follows: 1) Lengthening both the first and the <b>second</b> <b>marker</b> clearly causes the interval to be judged longer, 2) Lengthening the first marker tends to cause the interval to be judged longer, and 3) Lengthening the <b>second</b> <b>marker</b> also tends to cause the interval to be judged longer. When two short sounds are presented successively, they can act as markers of an empty time interval. Many studies have been made on the perception of empty time intervals, and it has been assumed that rhythm is based on the onset-to-onset timing of the elements (e. g., Handel, 1993). Thus, we define empty time intervals as temporal distances between onsets of successive sounds. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate how the perception of inter-onset time intervals is influenced by the marker durations. We conducted an experiment using sounds of different durations as markers...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to normal activation, markers {{can also be}} activated by using “chains”. If two markers overlap, {{and one of them}} is successfully activated, the <b>second</b> <b>marker</b> will become “reserved”. Reserved markers play automatically, without any player action. A reserved marker will also reserve any markers touching it. Thus, by activating one of several overlapped markers, players can form a chain of reserved markers. A player can also create a “chord” by activating two or more non-touching markers at the same time.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Supervisors {{are often}} {{involved}} {{in the assessment of}} projects they have supervised themselves. Previous research suggests that detailed marking sheets may alleviate leniency and halo effects. We set out to determine if, despite using such a marking schedule, leniency and halo effects were evident in the supervisors' marking of undergraduate short research projects (special study modules (SSM)). Methods Review of grades awarded by supervisors, <b>second</b> <b>markers</b> and control markers to the written reports of 4 th year medical students who had participated in an SSM during two full academic years (n = 399). Paired t-tests were used to compare mean marks, Pearson correlation to look at agreement between marks and multiple linear regression to test the prediction of one mark from several others adjusted for one another. Results There was a highly significant difference of approximately half a grade between supervisors and <b>second</b> <b>markers</b> with supervisors marking higher. (t = 3. 12, p Conclusions This study shows that with the use of structured marking sheet for assessment of undergraduate medical students, supervisors marks are not associated with a halo effect, but leniency does occur. As supervisor assessment is becoming more common in both under graduate and postgraduate teaching new ways to improve objectivity in marking and to address the leniency of supervisors should be sought. </p...|$|R

The fails were endorsed by the <b>second</b> <b>marker,</b> and confirmed by the university’s examiner board, but the chair of the examiner board arranged for exam remarking and elevated some scores. Professor Buckland objected, there was an inquiry, and the inquiry criticised the board and vindicated Professor Buckland. Nevertheless, Professor Buckland resigned claiming constructive dismissal. The University argued that Professor Buckland had resigned of his own accord, and so there could be no claim for unfair dismissal because there was no dismissal.|$|R
