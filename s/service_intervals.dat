25|$|A major {{challenge}} for waste gasification technologies {{is to reach}} an acceptable (positive) gross electric efficiency. The high efficiency of converting syngas to electric power is counteracted by significant power consumption in the waste preprocessing, the consumption of large amounts of pure oxygen (which is often used as gasification agent), and gas cleaning. Another challenge becoming apparent when implementing the processes in real life is to obtain long <b>service</b> <b>intervals</b> in the plants, {{so that it is}} not necessary to close down the plant every few months for cleaning the reactor.|$|E
500|$|BART {{could be}} {{characterized}} as a [...] "commuter subway," [...] since it has many characteristics of a regional commuter rail service, somewhat similar to S-Bahn services in Germany, Denmark, Austria and Switzerland, such as lengthy lines that extend to {{the far reaches of}} suburbia, with significant distances between stations. [...] BART also possesses some of the qualities of a metro system in the urban areas of San Francisco and Oakland; where multiple lines converge, it takes on the characteristics of an urban metro, including short headways and transfer opportunities to other lines. Urban stations are as close as [...] apart, and have combined 2½- to 5-minute <b>service</b> <b>intervals</b> at peak times.|$|E
2500|$|In 1967, Prest-O-Lite made a [...] "Black Box" [...] {{ignition}} amplifier, {{intended to}} take the load off of the distributor's breaker points during high r.p.m. runs, which was used by Dodge and Plymouth on their factory Super Stock Coronet and Belvedere drag racers. This amplifier was installed on the interior side of the cars' firewall, and had a duct which provided outside air to cool the unit. The rest of the system (distributor and spark plugs) remains as for the mechanical system. The lack of moving parts compared with the mechanical system leads to greater reliability and longer <b>service</b> <b>intervals.</b>|$|E

2500|$|On January 23, 2015, after {{less than}} two years of construction, traffic was reintroduced to the 600 block of Main Street, between Tupper and Chippewa Streets, in the Theater District. On December 15, 2015, two weeks behind its {{expected}} due date, traffic was reintroduced to the 500 block of Main Street, between Chippewa and Mohawk Streets, in the Central Business District. From July 11, 2016 to September 4, 2016, the outbound track from Allen/Medical Campus Station to Humboldt-Hospital Station were closed while rehabilitation work was being performed on the outbound track. This prolonged period of single-tracking resulted in 20-minute <b>service</b> <b>intervals</b> throughout the day, effectively halving peak weekday morning and evening commuter capacity. Immediately prior to the commencement of this rehabilitation work, peak weekday morning and evening service was running at 10-minute intervals. It has since resumed full service.|$|E
2500|$|Disc brakes are {{increasingly}} used on {{very large and}} heavy road vehicles, where previously large drum brakes were nearly universal. One {{reason is that the}} disc's lack of self-assist makes brake force much more predictable, so peak brake force can be raised without more risk of braking-induced steering or jackknife on articulated vehicles. Another is disc brakes fade less when hot, and in a heavy vehicle air and rolling drag and engine braking are small parts of total braking force, so brakes are used harder than on lighter vehicles, and drum brake fade can occur in a single stop. For these reasons, a heavy truck with disc brakes can stop in about 120% the distance of a passenger car, but with drums stopping takes about 150% the distance. In Europe, stopping distance regulations essentially require disc brakes for heavy vehicles. In the U.S., drums are allowed and are typically preferred for their lower purchase price, despite higher total lifetime cost and more frequent <b>service</b> <b>intervals.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The second {{generation}} Umnumzaan saw numerous modifications that utilizes {{some of the}} newer technologies found on the Sebenza 25. The single-most visual change was replacing the oversized custom pivot with a more traditional (Sebenza-style) pivot brushing. This new pivot no longer requires the Umnumzaan Take-down Tool and instead a traditional hex wrench {{is all that is}} needed to disassemble and reassemble the knife. This pivot is larger than most blade pivot brushing systems and is identical to the one used on the newer Large Sebenza 25 (mid-2012 release and with a pivot that is significantly thicker than the pivot used on the previous Large Sebenza 21). This pivot also incorporates a newer generation washer system with larger washer perforations, which helps retain lubricating grease better than previous designs, while simultaneously keeping elements out of the pivot system to increase <b>service</b> <b>intervals.</b> The change in pivot and washers is complimented by the modifications made to the ceramic ball and detent system, in which a larger ceramic ball in a slightly different location is used to make opening smoother and reduce wear (although it is unclear as to exactly when this specific change began).|$|E

2500|$|The 1975 {{model was}} advertised as [...] "a more {{efficient}} Corvette," [...] as <b>service</b> <b>intervals</b> were extended and electronic ignition and the federally mandated catalytic converter were introduced with [...] "unleaded fuel only" [...] warnings on the fuel gauge and filler door. Dual exhaust pipes were routed {{to a single}} converter, then split again leading to dual mufflers and tailpipes. Starting this year, tachometers were electronically driven. The Corvette began {{to be influenced by}} the metric system as speedometers now displayed small subfaces indicating kilometers-per-hour. 75's featured revised inner bumper systems with molded front and rear simulated bumper guards. The urethane rear bumper, now in its second year, reappeared as a one-piece seamless unit. This was the final year for Astro Ventilation. Power bottomed out this year — the base engine produced only [...] and the only remaining optional motor, the L-82, dropped an astonishing , managing to deliver [...] With no larger engine available, L-82 hood emblems began to appear on cars so equipped. Unchanged was the standard rear axle ratio for the base engine, which remained at 3.08 with automatic and 3.36 with manual transmission. This was the last convertible for the 1968-82 third-generation and only 12% of the cars were ordered as such. As in previous years, a folding top came standard with roadsters and a body color or vinyl covered hardtop was optional at additional cost. Anticipating further federal safety restrictions, Chevrolet believed it would be Corvette's last soft-top model ever but the convertible returned in 1986. Due to the state’s strict emissions standards, this was the last year Chevrolet installed the L-82 engine in a Corvette destined for California.|$|E

40|$|A problem {{attributed}} to first parity sows {{is the second}} litter syndrome (the number of piglets of the second litter is lower or similar to the first litter). The objectives {{of this study were}} to estimate the frequency of sows showing the second litter syndrome and to determine the effect of some risk factors on the drop of the liter size of second parity sows in a commercial farm in La Piedad Michoacan, Mexico. Data on 6809 sows were used. The data were analyzed by a binomial logistic regression model. The model included the fixed effect of year and season of farrowing, breed group, weaning to <b>service</b> <b>interval</b> and pigs born alive at first parity. 48. 1 % of the sows showed the syndrome. Year of farrowing, weaning to <b>service</b> <b>interval</b> and pigs born alive had effect (P< 0. 05) on the second-litter syndrome. Sows with more than 17 days weaning to <b>service</b> <b>interval</b> had lower odds, and sows with large litters born alive at first parity had higher odds of a drop in litter size at second parity. Therefore, greater attention should be given to first parity sows with large litters at first parity...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationships}} between the calving to first <b>service</b> <b>interval</b> and several measures of reproductive performance were examined in 1738 lactation records from cows in 32 southern Ontario Holstein herds. Lactation records were divided into three separate health categories based on postpartal disease histories. Relationships between the calving to first <b>service</b> <b>interval</b> and the first service conception rate, number of services per conception and open interval were similar for all three categories. The first service conception rate was lower and {{the average number of}} services per conception higher in cows first mated before 60 days when compared to cows first mated after 60 days. The relationship between the calving to first <b>service</b> <b>interval</b> and the open interval indicated that for each day that mating was delayed the open interval was extended by 0. 86 days. Overall conception rates may be lower for cows first mated very early or very late, but differences in the overall conception rate were only significant for cows with a reproductive tract infection. Unless very expensive semen is being used, it is suggested that disease free cows be mated at the first heat occurring after 40 days postpartum, and that cows with postpartal disease be mated at the first heat occurring after 60 days postpartum. ...|$|R
