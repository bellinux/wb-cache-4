40|$|Background: In {{the last}} years Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) has been playing an {{important}} role in the treatment of Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF). A lot of trials have shown improvements in clinical features (respiratory rate, neurological score), pH and arterial blood gases. Methods: In particular clinical conditions, such as Acute Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema (ACPE) and acute exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), systematic reviews and meta-analysis show a reduction in the need for intubation and in-hospital mortality compared to standard medical treatment. In other clinical conditions, such as acute asthma, Acute Lung Injury (ALI) /Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and severe pneumonia, NIV does not show significant improvements in term of avoided intubations or mortality rate. Although the first important data on NIV comes from studies performed in Intensive Care Units (ICUs), subsequently these methodologies of ventilation have been used with increasing frequency in Emergency Departments (ED) and medical wards. Results: Studies developed in ICU sometimes report slightly worse outcomes compared to studies performed in general wards due to the need to treat more severe patients in ICU. Aetiology remains one of the most important factor determining prognosis: different pathological mechanisms <b>substain</b> different clinical conditions and not in all cases the application of positive pressures to the airways is useful. NIV for ARF due to COPD and ACPE is feasible, safe and effective also in a general medical ward if selection of patients, staff training and monitoring are appropriate: its early application improves clinical parameters, arterial blood gases, prevents endotracheal intubation, decreases mortality and hospitalisation. This should encourage the diffusion of NIV in this specific setting...|$|E

Although anti-CD 25 mAb treatment significantly decreased parasite numbers in IL- 4 R � �/ � mice, treatment with anti-IL- 10 R mAb virtually eliminated L. major parasites in both footpad and dermal infection sites. In addition, IL- 4 R � � RAG 2 mice reconstituted with CD 4 � cells depleted of CD 25 � Treg cells remained highly susceptible to infection. Analysis of L. major-infected BALB/c and IL- 4 R � �/ � inflammatory sites revealed that the majority of IL- 10 was secreted by the CD 4 � Foxp 3 � population, with a fraction of IL- 10 coming from CD 4 � Foxp 3 � Treg cells.

40|$|The recent {{reform in}} European {{antitrust}} enforcement is embodied in Regolation n. 1 / 2003 / Ce and related Communications. Since 2004 {{when it came}} into force, some crytical assessments can already be made. The work starts from some technical analysis of the reform, under a procedural perspective, to assess the proceedings’ real impact on parties’ rights and to criticize its limits. Decentralisation has brought about more complicacies, since community procedural systems are not harmonized, neither in their administrative rules, nor in their civil proceedings, which are all involved in the European antitrust network. Therefore, antitrust proceedings end un as being more jurisdictional in their effects than in their guarentees, which is a flaw to be mended by legislators. National laws shoud be harmonized, community law should be clarified and the system should turn more honestly towards a rationalized jurisdiction-cented mechanism. Otherwise, parties defense rights and the overall efficiency are put into doubt. Italy is a good exemple of how many colmlicacies can outburst from national procedures and national decentralised application. An uncertain pattern of judicial control, together with unclear relationships among the institutions to cooperate in the antitrust network can produce more problems than they aim to solve. As to the private enforcement, Regulation n. 1 does not even attempt to give precise regulation to this underdeveloped sector. A continual comparison with U. S. system has brought the Commission to become aware both of the risks and of the advanteges of an increased civil antitrust litigation in fronto of national judges. In order to <b>substain</b> a larger development of this parallel and, presently, difficult way of judicial compensation, it is presently ongoing a consultation among states to find suitable incentives to make private enforcement more appealing and effective. The solution to this lack of private litigation {{is not to be}} sought in Regulation n. 1 which calls into action national legislators and proceedures to implement further improvements. As a conclusion, Regulation n. 1 is the outpost of an ambitious community design to create an efficient control mechanism over antitrust violations. It focuses on Commission proceedings, powers and sanctions in order to establish deterrence, then it highlights civil litigation perspectives and it involves directly states into antitrust application. It seems that more could be done to technically shape administrative proceedings in a more jurisdictionally oriented form, then to clarify respective roles and coordination mecanisms in order to prevent difficulties easy to forsee. Some of jurisprudential suggestions have been accepted, but much more is left {{to be done in the}} future to improve european antitrust enforcement system...|$|E

The certainty of rules is the expression of impartiality and guarantee which should be assured by the "fixity" of the law. Neverthless one can point out the insufficinet reconnaissance of the rules seen as pure written record, that is the "liturgic text" to individuate the real content of the law. The author gives variegated exemplifications about it. Viceversa the rule exists because it is "alive", and in it is its effective vitality.

Therefore, very aften the architecture of the hierarchy of sources is unsteady.

All this is the consequence of the interface law of politics. If, from one side it can be considered as an element of disorder, from another side it is it which puts en order and consolidate the unique law from which one cannot avarial necessarily to consider:the "state law", the only one which everybody refers to (if, for example, we want to refer to communities rules, or to the lex mercatoria this involves our referring to the state law which guarantees the concrete execution).

However, the role played by cytolitic molecules that may participate in Acanthamoebal cytopathogenicity has yet to be completely elucidated. The aim of this work was to study whether soluble molecules released by A. castellanii trophozoites could induce cytopathic effect in human epithelial cells in vitro. The results obtained indicate that A. castellanii trophozoites constitutively elaborate and release soluble factors that immediately elicit a cytosolic free-calcium increase in target cells. This phenomenon is induced by low molecular weight amoebic metabolites and depends on a transmembrane influx of extracellular calcium. Morphological changes, cytoskeletal damage, cell death and cytolysis followed the elevation of cytosolic free-calcium levels. Calcium ions are very important for cell homeostasis, in fact, they control the functions of a variety of cellular responses, including secretion, cell proliferation and apoptosis.

We highlight a role of h-Prune in <b>substaining</b> Wnt/β-catenin pathway thus investigating the molecular mechanism underlying the observed phenotype. We notice that h-Prune overexpression lead to higher rate of GSK 3 -β phosphorylation resulting in its inactivation. To follow the Wnt pathway variation mediated by Prune in vivo, we generate a double transgenic mice model pVegfr 2 -luc/ML-h-Prune that shows an higher signal of bioluminescence driven by the pVegfr 2 promoter, in agreement of the maximum peak of h-Prune expression. Thus these analyses in vivo show that h-Prune is able to enhance VEGF-α, through its <b>substaining</b> activation of the WNT signaling in the mouse skin. Because of the knowledge of Notch signaling involved into an altered differentiation pattern of keratynocytes, we observed in the ML-h-Prune transgenic skin an unbalanced differentiation phenotype, thus we decide to analyze the level of the Notch pathway activation in transgenic mice skin. We show here a substantial reduction of downstream effectors of these signaling in the h-Prune transgenic animals. The phenotype of our transgenic model is very close to an inflammatory phenotype, with unbalancing levels of both WNT and Notch pathways, thus postulating a correlation of h-Prune overespression and consequent inflammation into the mice skin. For these reasons we analyzed h-Prune together with β-catenin nuclearization in serial sections of human psoriatic skin, asserting an involvement of h-Prune in these pathology, a disease which retains both proinflammatory insult and higher WNT-activated proliferation phenotype. This model could be the base for future studies that will assess properties and functions of h-Prune in human disorders which are related to hyperproliferation and inflammation of the skin. This is an attempt to find molecular targets for future therapeutic applications in the treatment of inflammatory skin pathologies...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} fast and {{accurate}} collision detection algorithm for haptic interaction with polygonal models. Given a model, we pre-compute a hybrid hierarchical representation, consisting of uniform grids (represented using a hash table) and trees of tight- tting oriented bounding box trees (OBBTrees). At run time, we use hybrid hierarchical representations and exploit frame-to-frame coherence for fast proximity queries. We describe a new overlap test, which is specialized for intersection {{of a line}} segment withanoriented bounding box for haptic simulation and takes 42 - 72 operations including transformation costs. The algorithms have been implemented as part of H-COLLIDE and interfaced with a PHANToM arm and its haptic toolkit, GHOST, and applied {{to a number of}} models. As compared to the commercial implementation, we are able to achieve up to 20 times speedup in our experiments and sustain update rates over 1000 Hz on a 400 MHz Pentium II. In practice, our prototype implementation can accurately and e ciently detect contacts between a virtual probe guided by a force-feedback arm and large complex geometries composed {{of tens of thousands of}} polygons, with <b>substained</b> kHz rates. ...|$|R
