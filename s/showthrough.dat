40|$|In {{scanning}} {{pages with}} double-sided printing, often the printing on the back-side shows {{through in the}} scan of the front-side because the paper is not completely opaque. This <b>showthrough</b> is an undesirable artifact that one would like to remove. In this paper, the phenomenon of show-through is analyzed using first physical principles to obtain a simplified mathematical model. The model is linearized using suitable transformations and simplifying approximations. Based on the linearized model, an adaptive linear filtering scheme is developed for the electronic removal of show-through using scans of {{both sides of the}} document. Experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the method developed are presented. Index Terms [...] -Adaptive filtering, restoration, scanning, <b>showthrough.</b> I...|$|E

The method combines classical queryprocessing techniques and a plane-sweeping algorithm. We compare our approach to the simple indexed-nested-loopmethod and to the state-of-the-art algorithms, and <b>showthrough</b> analysis and experiments on synthetic and real-life datasetsthat our method outperforms in most cases the other ones,both in CPU and I/O.

40|$|The {{problem of}} seethrough {{cancellation}} in digital images of double-sided documents is addressed. Previous approaches {{to solve this}} problem from recto-verso pairs of grayscale data images show a number of drawbacks, ranging from errors due to an inadequate data model to excessive computational complexities. While satisfying the need to assume a nonlinear convolutional mixture model and to estimate its parameters along with the recto and verso patterns, we propose a simple and fast strategy to estimate the trasparency of the paper and the seethrough convolutional kernel, thus enabling an efficient correction of this distortion. Compared to other separation strategies, our choice is slightly more cumbersome since average background values must be estimated and a pure <b>showthrough</b> area must be isolated manually by the operator. Although the procedure cannot be fully automatic, however, it outperforms other restoration strategies, especially if based on linear instantaneous models...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDigital {{documents}} are usually degraded during the scanning process {{due to the}} contents of the backside of the scanned manuscript. This is often caused by the <b>showthrough</b> effect, i. e. the backside image that interferes with the main front side picture due to the intrinsic transparency of the paper. This phenomenon is one of the degradations that one would like to remove especially in the field of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or document digitalization which require denoised texts as inputs. In this paper, we first propose a novel and general nonlinear model for canceling the show-through phenomenon. A nonlinear blind source separation algorithm is used for this purpose based on a newrecursive and extendible structure. However, the results are restricted due to a blurring effect that appears during the scanning process due to the light transfer function of the paper. Consequently, for improving the results, we introduce a refined separating architecture for simultaneously removing the show-through and blurring effects...|$|E

Teve sua publica??o primeira na revista inglesa Punch (1846), sendo traduzido posteriormente. O {{principal}} objetivo do escritor era mostra por meio da s?tira uma vis?o diferenciada da sociedade da Inglaterra vitoriana. Este trabalho consiste em investigar os textos ficcionais e n?o-ficcionais ingleses presentes nos jornais da prov?ncia paraibana, mapear os romances ingleses em folhetim e analisar mais detidamente o romance O Livros dos Snobs, corpus desta pesquisa, com a finalidade de compreender as pr?ticas de circula??o e publica??o do romance ingl?s em folhetim nos jornais paraibanos no s?culo XIX. Buscamos analisar fontes como artigos, an?ncios, reclames, bem como o pr?prio romance ingl?s, que serviram de base para mapear a presen?a de fic??o inglesa em peri?dicos paraibanos. Refletimos com autores como Chartier (1990; 2002; 2011), Barbosa (2007; 2011), Freyre (2000), Ramicelli (2009), Hansen (2004), entre outros, que nos ajudaram a compreender a import?ncia cultural inglesa no desenvolvimento da Para?ba, bem como a entender o espa?o dos romances ingleses em folhetim nos jornais paraibanos. The serialized English novel The Book of Snobs (1846) by W. M. Thackeray {{was published}} in 1891 in the newspaper O Estado da Para?ba. It {{was first published in}} the British magazine Punch (1846) and translated later. The author's main purpose was to <b>show?through</b> satire? a different perspective of the aristocratic society in Victorian England. This paper aims to investigate the English works of fiction and non-fiction in the newspapers in the province of Paraiba, map out the serialized English novels and analyze more thoroughly the novel The Book of Snobs, which is the corpus of this research. Our aim is to understand the circulation and publication practices of the serialized English novel in Paraiba newspapers in the 19 th century. We analyzed source materials such as articles, ads, announcements, as well as the English novel itself, which served as a basis to map the presence of English fiction in Para?ba's newspapers. We reflect with authors such as Chartier (1990; 2002; 2011), Barbosa (2007; 2011), Freyre (2000), Ramicelli (2009), Hansen (2004), among others, who helped us to understand the English cultural importance in the development of Para?ba, as well as to understand the space of English novels in serialized in Para?ba?s newspaper...|$|E
