40|$|Commercial {{and model}} shaft seal rings with {{polytetrafluoroethylene}} sealing lips (PTFE - <b>sleeve</b> <b>gasket</b> rings) {{have been subjected}} to an experimental study to characterize thrust forces, friction behaviour, delivery behaviour and leakage at different states of lubrification (normal and deficiency lubrication, dry operation), and to describe the influence of the shape of the sealing lips on friction and leakage. Minimum leakage was found on seal rings with helical groves. Finite element calculations on the shape of sealing lips demonstrated good agreement between experimental and theoretical results.

40|$|The paper {{considers}} a developed computational model {{to study a}} stress-strain state of the assembly unit components of a medium-speed diesel engine of new generation, type CH 26. 5 / 31, which comprises a cylinder head, a <b>sleeve,</b> a <b>gasket,</b> a block, two mounting studs and four power studs. The developed three-dimensional finite element model {{presented in this article}} allows us to take into consideration all the components that make up a gas joint, regardless of their geometric complexity. Its use enables us to estimate the cylinder head - <b>gasket</b> - <b>sleeve</b> tightness of sealing when applying the mounting, temperature, and gas loads, to define the stress and strain components of parts, as well as to study the gasket condition, including pressure distribution across its surface. Based on the results obtained in the study the finite element model of the cylinder head was modified considering a more detailed description of its geometry, thus reducing the principal tensile stresses. </p...|$|R
