The $77 million project involved the renovation of the building and adjacent parcels of land into a complex containing a 550-seat theater, a Performance Development Center, a student residence hall, a 125-seat black box theater, a 170-seat film screening room, eight rehearsal studios ranging from 700 sq ft to 1900 sq ft, six practice rooms for individuals and small groups, a sound stage for film production classes, a scene shop, several classrooms, a restaurant, and up to a dozen offices for faculty and staff. Design was by Elkus Manfredi Architects, Boston.

40|$|The use and {{interest}} in underfloor ventilation systems has been growing due to the systems’ energy savings and inherent flexibility. Because the air distribution openings are in the floor, there has been concern over excessive sound transfer between adjacent spaces through the floor plenum, {{which could lead to}} unacceptable levels of speech privacy and other acoustical problems. Charles M. Salter Associates was hired to provide acoustical input for <b>room</b> acoustics and <b>sound</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>between</b> spaces in an office building incorporating an underfloor air distribution system. The office spaces had differing acoustical requirements, for which five wall types were specified based on the levels of noise reduction and speech privacy required between spaces. Standard offices had walls that terminated {{at the top of the}} raised floor and the floor plenum was left open, while executive offices and conference rooms had an acoustical septum added in the floor plenum at the location of the common wall. This septum was installed to reduce the transfer of noise in the floor plenum between adjacent spaces. Finally, full-height walls were specified for adjacent spaces requiring the highest level of noise reduction. All partitions were extended to the slab above, with offset return air transfer grilles installed on the corridor or open plan side of the offices, to minimize the potential flanking sound path. After construction was completed, acoustical measurements were conducted to quantify the level of noise reduction and speech privacy between adjacent spaces. The overall level of speech privacy between all the various tested spaces met normal privacy standards. The noise reduction performance of the walls without acoustical septums was generally a few points lower than the noise reduction of the same wall as tested in a laboratory without a raised floor. The noise reduction performance of the walls with the acoustical septum was generally the same as the same wall’s performance in the laboratory. This data seems to indicate that the acoustical septum was effective in reducing noise transfer through the floor plenum, and an acoustical septum may be warranted for spaces requiring high levels of speech privacy...|$|R

The inter-zone airflows in a typical isolation ward were modelled to unveil the issues that are critical to isolation performance and to determine the practicality of the recommendations in the literature. It was found that the air leakage through partitions and door gaps would be highly undesirable.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of field measurements in 29 courtrooms in Portugal (average volume of 440 m 3) regarding their acoustic behavior to several objective parameters: (RT, EDT, C 80, D 50, TS, RASTI and Dn,w). The individual results show, for instance, that the mean measured values in each room for RASTI were from 0. 39 to 0. 74 (with a global mean value of 0. 53 for all rooms) and for the RT (500 / 1 k Hz) were from 0. 5 to 3. 6 s (with a global mean of 1. 6 s for all rooms). The evaluation of the airborne <b>sound</b> <b>isolation</b> index (Dn,w) <b>between</b> courtroom and main lobby found values from 17 to 30 dB. These results show an insufficient acoustical behavior for almost all these courtrooms. Two groups of rooms were formed regarding their date of construction: "old " (prior to the 1990 s) and "recent " but the statistical analysis did not support the hypothesis that the two groups presented acoustically diverse behavior. However, the only room in this study that was object of acoustic treatment had values considered to be statistically distinct from the others. Simple formulas are presented that relate among the objective acoustic parameters and between the acoustic and the architectural parameters...|$|R

These materials are divided into groups and the noise isolation of these materials is tested by a device made locally. The results of these materials are compared and the following conclusions are reached: the <b>sound</b> <b>isolation</b> increases generally {{with the increase of}} the frequency, the increase is not linear but vibrated and a relative decrease in the sound insolation is noticed for the frequencies from 2000 Hz to 4000 Hz.

The <b>sound</b> <b>isolation</b> increases with the increase of the thickness if the density is stable. The <b>sound</b> <b>isolation</b> increases with the increase of the thickness of gap between two layers of a material and the highest value of the loss of sound transition corresponds a highest value of reducing of noise level. The lowest value of the noise reduction index corresponds to the lowest value of reducing of noise level.

50|$|The overall sound {{blocking}} {{capacity of}} a partition with Acoustiblok added cannot be calculated by simply adding 26 to the STC rating of a partition as found in reference sources, due to mechanical and acoustical variations in different partition wall and floor/ceiling designs, {{as well as the}} fact that STC is a logarithmic calculation and therefore cannot simply be summed. The most reliable comparative indicator of Acoustiblok's performance in practical application is laboratory measurement of the acoustical performance of test partitions.

50|$|Sound damping {{tapes and}} other {{materials}} {{have been used to}} reduce both vibration and sound transmission through materials since the early 1930s. Although the applications of sound damping was largely limited to defense and industrial applications such as naval vessels and aircraft in the past, recent research has proven the effectiveness of damping in interior <b>sound</b> <b>isolation</b> in buildings. Constrained-layer damping gypsum wallboard panels increase <b>sound</b> <b>isolation</b> in building partitions by drastically reducing the vibration of panels and, incidentally, the radiation of sound through panels. The shear loading of a highly visco-elastic interlayer sandwiched between two more rigid constraining layers causes decreased displacement due to vibration, reducing the amount of sound energy radiated through a panel between enclosures. Damped gypsum wallboard panels are effective in reducing sound transmission over a broad range of frequencies and especially useful for achieving high levels of speech privacy between partitions.|$|R
