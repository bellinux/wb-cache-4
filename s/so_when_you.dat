Without {{first choice}} striker Bergkamp, Wenger partnered Anelka with Wreh, leaving Wright on the {{substitutes}} bench. Arsenal {{scored in the}} 23rd minute; Overmars sprinted onto a pass from Petit, and used his pace to get past Alessandro Pistone and toe-poke the ball between goalkeeper Shay Given's legs. Anelka scored in the second half, from a pass by Parlour to settle the match. In his post-match interview, Wenger praised the [...] "remarkable" [...] Overmars: [...] " [...] even more <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> realise that he has scored so many goals in important games {{that we needed to}} win." ...|$|E

In 1875 she resumed her public duties, including fund-raising, medical and social work, which had always held her interest. She maintained active correspondence with the social reformer Octavia Hill. However, in these years, relations with her husband deteriorated. In late 1876, she travelled to England for treatment due to an internal complaint caused by a backward curvature of the womb, and remained at Balmoral while she recovered. From Balmoral, she wrote to her husband criticising the childishness of his letters: [...] "f my children wrote me such childish letters – only short accounts – of where and what they had eaten or {{where they had been}} etc., and no opinions, observations and remarks, I should be surprised – and how much more <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> write like that!"

2500|$|Upon its release, I'm Serious {{received}} universal widespread {{critical acclaim}} from most music critics. Some critics, however, {{pointed to the}} fact that many of the tracks sounded the same and that a few were blatant rip-offs. Allmusic writer Jon Azpiri wrote [...] "T.I. claims to be the king of the South, but on I'm Serious he fails to show and prove. He does, however, have potential. If his talent ever matches his confidence, he may be headed for stardom." [...] Down-South gave the album a four out of five stars saying [...] "With his solo finally about to drop, this album should be his gateway into the mainstream arena.

2500|$|Although The Wolf Age {{was built}} using Soulblighter source code, the {{developers}} made significant changes, {{the single biggest}} of which was that everything in The Wolf Age is rendered in OpenGL 3D, including the characters and all environmental objects. The Wolf Age was the first Myth game to feature fully 3D characters, rather than 2D sprites in a 3D environment. Of the move to full 3D, Dochtermann {{points out that the}} 3D engine allows for things not possible in the previous games; [...] "There's some very cool kinematics stuff. <b>So</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have explosions, and when your units move through the world, the trees will respond.

2500|$|Indiana players wear {{warm-up pants}} that are striped red and white, like the stripes of a candy cane. They were first {{worn by the}} team in the 1970s under head coach Bob Knight. At {{the time they were}} in keeping with the fashion trends of the 1970s, but despite {{changing}} styles they have since become an iconic part of playing for Indiana. IU star guard Steve Alford said, [...] "As you watch television and you watch the IU games, that's the first thing you saw, was the team run out in the candy stripes. <b>So</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> finally got to put those on, those are pretty special." [...] Rusty Stillions, Director of Indiana's Equipment Operations, said the pants were originally available only for team members. However, changes in licensing agreements permitted the general public to buy them as well. They have since become a staple at games and other Indiana basketball events. Beginning in 2014, during Hoosier Hysteria, former IU basketball players have presented to the new players their first pair of candy striped pants. This practice symbolizes a [...] "passing-of-the-torch" [...] and carrying on the rich tradition and responsibilities of playing for Indiana University.|$|E

2500|$|GameSpot's Greg Mueller {{scored the}} PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox {{versions}} 8.1 out of 10, calling the game [...] "a satisfying, lengthy adventure," [...] and arguing [...] "it remains {{faithful to the}} classic film while managing to create a compelling story of its own [...] it handles the source material respectfully and manages to offer enough new content to feel like {{more than just a}} by-the-numbers adaptation of the movie." [...] IGN's Douglass C. Perry scored the PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions 7.9 out of 10, with the Xbox version finishing as runner-up in the March 2006 [...] "Xbox Game of the Month" [...] award, losing to [...] Perry praised the concept of placing a new character in the existing narrative; [...] "Much of the story is carefully untarnished, <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> see pivotal scenes, they will be left relatively untouched. You'll hear and see these key scenes unfolding in front of you, but you'll be in the house, the car, the church, or the hospital as a close associate, rather than a bystander. You'll feel like an insider who's part of a great powerful narrative, and the feeling is eerily remarkable." [...] Although he was critical of the melee combat and the driving portions of the game, he called the extortion system [...] "awesome fun." [...] He concluded, [...] "people looking for a perfect game will be disappointed [...] there are elements that totally stand out from any similar games in this genre, from the extortion system to the business take-over model. Despite obvious areas in need of improvement, I had a blast playing The Godfather." [...] GameSpy's Will Tuttle scored the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions 3.5 out of 5. Praising the use of the license, he wrote [...] "the game is best viewed as a complementary addition to the Godfather universe," [...] calling it [...] "an ultimately entertaining sandbox game that doesn't really do much to help or hurt the license." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cage's fight {{style in}} the series was called [...] "smack-fu" [...] by Coker, {{referring}} {{to the way he}} tried not to punch anybody since that would probably kill them with his super strength. To film the effect of bullets bouncing off of Cage, remote controlled devices were attached to Colter and operated by somebody behind the cameras. The devices had the ability to [...] "burn the skin if not attached properly to clothing, and [...] once almost lost hearing in one ear when he forgot to insert the required ear pieces." [...] The third episode begins with a couch coming out of the window of the fictional Crispus Attucks complex in Harlem. This was a tease of a large fight scene shown in full later in the episode, on which Coker said, [...] "You're already anticipating what's going to happen, <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> finally do get to that moment and then the music kicks in, it takes on this new energy." [...] The fight itself is the series' version of the 'superhero hallway fight' made famous in Daredevil, with Coker explaining, [...] "We wanted to do something that, while in the same realm, was its own thing ... That's what this whole show is about, ultimately, being able to do the superhero thing with flavor." [...] Filming for the fight was influenced by [...] "Arnold Schwarzenegger’s invading the police station in Terminator", {{and was one of the}} toughest sequences for the crew to shoot; it took a 14-hour day, and Colter attributed the successful completion of the sequence, including the couch shot, to director Guillermo Navarro. Colter also called the fourth episode particularly difficult to film, taking around 12 or 13 days to shoot. The episode was written by executive producer Charles Murray, [...] "a geek bar none" [...] who looked to organically transition the character's origin story from the original comics into the modern world of the series for the episode. This involved flashback sequences with Colter in makeup and different costumes, and each scene was shot by director Vincenzo Natali in many camera setups.|$|E
