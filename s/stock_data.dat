50|$|Technicians {{say that}} the EMH and random walk {{theories}} both ignore the realities of markets, in that participants are not completely rational and that current price moves are not independent of previous moves.

Shaikh devised ingenious techniques to test classical theories of value empirically, using input-output data, capital <b>stock</b> <b>data,</b> labour data, price indexes and incomes data. He claims that generally the deviation of estimated labour-values from the corresponding observable market prices of products is not very great (around 1/8th or so), which suggests that {{the classical}} transformation problem is empirically much less significant than previously thought.|$|E

50|$|CNNfn, a now-defunct {{business}} news network spun-off from CNN, {{was the first}} to create a fully automated stock ticker for television. Until the network launched in 1996, computers were not able to maintain the entire stock feed in memory to enable delaying all quotes and commodity summaries in 15-minute intervals. Tickers previously implemented for the purpose of disseminating <b>stock</b> <b>data</b> were preselected subsets of the feed and could not automatically select stocks of interest without manual intervention. Working with SGI and Standard & Poor's data feed, Nils B. Lahr, a developer at CNNfn, developed the first system that could provide delayed stock market quotes in a dynamic television display as a ticker. This was a major advancement, as the viewers, for the first time, understood that the ticker represented all available stocks and thus would reflect any vital changes without manual intervention or pre-selected stock quotes.|$|E
50|$|According to {{statistical}} calculations by Shaikh and Tsoulfidis, {{the discrepancies}} {{between the different}} empirical measures of product-values, prices of production, regulating prices and market prices which are feasible (using input-output data, labour data and capital <b>stock</b> <b>data)</b> turn out to be, on the whole, not very large. This suggests that the enormously long Marxist debate {{about the relationship between}} product-values and product-prices was, in a sense, unwarranted; overall, the differences between average product-prices and the underlying product-values are, as far as can be established, just not very great. And if the price/value differences are not very great, then Marx was quite justified in mostly disregarding them in Capital, Volume I and Capital, Volume II. Had Marxists been able to measure price-value relationships of products empirically, earlier on in the controversy, they might not have given the issue so much weight; but the econometric techniques to do it were perfected only from the 1980s onward.|$|E

Since it includes information concerning the current flow data of OFDI, the problem of endogenous bias could not be avoided. In reality, no matter OFDI takes the form of merger and acquisition, the legal procedure, site construction, procurement and installation of production equipment, and recruitment and training of production personnel all need to consume a certain amount of time. Instead, lagged data of OFDI stock fully considered the required time lag that investment flow transformed into actual production capacity. Therefore, this paper selected the lagged terms of OFDI stock as the core explanatory variable in empirical analysis. 2 The paper also provides regression results using current flow data and <b>stock</b> <b>data</b> for comparison. They are based on the same set of sample so the differences between the conclusions are solely attributable to different selections of core explanatory variables. Regression results reveal that with the current flow and <b>stock</b> <b>data</b> as the explanatory variables, the estimated value and significance of promoting effect are overestimated while that of substitution effect are underestimated.
