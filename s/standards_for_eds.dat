40|$|Objective: This paper {{examined}} the economic cost of male erectile dysfunction (<b>ED)</b> <b>for</b> a hypothetical managed-care (MC) model. Design and Setting: A prevalence-based cost-of-illness approach {{was used to}} estimate the direct medical cost <b>for</b> <b>ED</b> treatment. A treatment plan algorithm was developed from a MC perspective to model the initial treatment selection of various patient groups [vacuum erection device, intracavernosal injection (ICI) therapy, transurethral alprostadil suppository, sildenafil, testosterone replacement therapy, penile prosthesis] and their therapy outcomes during a 3 -year period. Overall cost was based on 1998 US dollars. Total direct medical cost of ED considered in this model included the cost of initial physician consultation and evaluation, the cost incurred by patients from various treatment groups (pharmacological and surgical options), {{as well as the}} cost related to patients' follow-up for treatment within the 3 -year period. Consideration for therapy switches made by patients who failed initial therapy was included as part of the clinical assumptions for this model. Treatment response and expected outcomes (dropouts) were considered for the various treatment options. Participants: A total of 100 000 enrolled members were included in the study. Main outcome measures and results: The total cost of ED was $US 3 204 792 for the 3 -year period in the hypothetical MC plan. The treatment portion accounted for approximately 80 % of the total cost while the cost of medical services and diagnostic tests were minimal in comparison. The 3 year total cost of nonsurgical treatment was $US 2 473 045. Costs associated with each treatment alternative were $US 81 866 (testosterone transdermal patch), $US 51 930 (vacuum erection device), $US 384 624 (ICI therapy), $US 226 483 (transurethral alprostadil suppository) and $US 1 728 142 (sildenafil citrate). Results from the model showed a noticeable trend of decreasing cost patterns over time and reflected the attrition observed for many of the <b>standard</b> medical therapies <b>for</b> <b>ED.</b> Conclusions: Sildenafil and the vacuum erection device should be considered as first-line management strategies <b>for</b> <b>ED</b> whereas ICI therapy, transurethral alprostadil suppository and penile prosthesis implant should be reserved for second- or third-line therapy. Because costs associated with switches related to successive treatment failures can be high, treatment considerations should, therefore, focus on achieving long term patient satisfaction. The patient's preferred treatment choice, using goal-directed therapy during the initial consultation and evaluation visit, should be used.

40|$|Introduction. Well {{informed}} and educated patients ideally manage {{to prevent or}} delay the onset of severe chronic diseases. With respect to erectile dysfunction (ED) this is of importance because ED is considered to herald debilitating cardiovascular diseases like coronary artery disease. Aim. This survey aimed to assess patient's knowledge about risk factors (RF) <b>for</b> <b>ED</b> and to identify their preferred source of information. Main Outcome Measures. Knowledge of RF <b>for</b> <b>ED</b> and sources used to gather information about ED as reported by patients with ED. Methods. Between July 2004 and June 2006, 126 patients who presented at our outpatient clinic for an assessment of their ED were prospectively evaluated. The patients received a questionnaire about their demographic and socioeconomic circumstances, their strategies to gather information about ED, and their knowledge of specific RF for this disease. The questionnaire was completed by 81 patients (64 %). Results. Forty-one patients (51 %) could not name one single RF <b>for</b> <b>ED.</b> Three men knew more than three RF. The two most popular sources of information were the Internet and general practitioners. Well-educated patients were significantly better informed than others. Patients using the Internet as source for health information were significantly younger and had a better knowledge about RF <b>for</b> <b>ED</b> compared to those not using the Internet. Conclusions. Patients' knowledge about RF <b>for</b> <b>ED</b> is poor. The Internet {{seems to be the}} most useful information source <b>for</b> patients with <b>ED</b> and is predominantly used by younger and better educated patients.

40|$|Background/aims: Portal {{hypertension}} (PH) complications {{are leading}} causes of death in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC). PH development in chronic liver disease depends on increased vascular intra-hepatic resistance and on hyperdynamic splanchnic circulation. Disturbances in “Endothelium-dependent” vasodilation, a condition known as “endothelial dysfunction” (ED), has been claimed as an important factor responsible for increased vascular hepatic resistance and PH development in LC. Aims {{of this study were}} to assess in LC patients: (1) the presence of ED and its correlation with disease stage and (2) correlation between of ED serum markers (MED) and flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), the gold <b>standard</b> test <b>for</b> evaluating <b>ED.</b> Material and methods: 60 consecutive LC patients (mean age 65 ± 10 years, 17 female) without portal thrombosis (40 with compensated and 20 with decompensated disease) underwent a complete clinical, radiological and biochemical evaluation in order to assess the stage of disease and drug history; all subjects were assessed for MED [P-selectin, von Willebrand factor (vWF), endothelin- 1 (ET- 1), thrombomodulin (TM) and nitric oxide (NO) ] serum levels and FMD (measured by ultrasound at brachial artery according to guidelines). MED and FMD were also assessed in 11 healthy subjects (mean age 26 ± 6. 6 female; controls).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a new approach}} to the automated segmentation of X-ray left ventricular (LV) angiograms, based on active appearance models (AAMs) and dynamic programming. A coupling of shape and texture information between the end-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) frame was achieved by constructing a multiview AAM. Over-constraining of the model was compensated for by employing dynamic programming, integrating both intensity and motion features in the cost function. Two applications are compared: a semi-automatic method with manual model initialization, and a fully automatic algorithm. The first proved to be highly robust and accurate, demonstrating high clinical relevance. Based on experiments involving 70 patient data sets, the algorithm's success rate was 100 % <b>for</b> <b>ED</b> and 99 % for ES, with average unsigned border positioning errors of 0. 68 mm <b>for</b> <b>ED</b> and 1. 45 mm for ES. Calculated volumes were accurate and unbiased. The fully automatic algorithm, with intrinsically less user interaction was less robust, but showed a high potential, mostly due to a controlled gradient descent in updating the model parameters. The success rate of the fully automatic method was 91 % <b>for</b> <b>ED</b> and 83 % for ES, with average unsigned border positioning errors of 0. 79 mm <b>for</b> <b>ED</b> and 1. 55 mm for E...|$|R

Methods: A randomized controlled trial (n= 539) was conducted at an urban Level I trauma center of brief intervention (1 ED session of brief intervention), brief motivational intervention for alcohol plus a booster (1 ED session plus booster session), or <b>standard</b> care <b>for</b> injured <b>ED</b> patients with an alcohol use problem who were being discharged home. At 12 months, alcohol-related negative consequences and injuries were measured. We performed a secondary analysis comparing motor vehicle crash–injured patients and non–motor vehicle crash–injured patients in the study sample. Results: Subcritically injured ED patients with harmful or hazardous alcohol use who received brief motivational intervention for alcohol plus a booster had fewer alcohol-related negative consequences and alcohol-related injuries than those receiving brief intervention or standard care at 12 -month follow-up (previously reported). A secondary analysis of this result showed that motor vehicle crash patients (n= 133) given brief motivational intervention for alcohol plus a booster (n= 34) had fewer alcohol-related injuries than those receiving standard care (n= 46; P=. 001). Moreover, {{there were no significant differences}} in alcohol-related injuries among the non–motor vehicle crash–injured patients who received brief intervention or standard care. Conclusion: Brief motivational intervention for alcohol plus a booster is a useful intervention <b>for</b> subcritically injured <b>ED</b> patients with harmful or hazardous alcohol use.
