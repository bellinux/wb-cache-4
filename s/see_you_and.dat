Describing the fan following of the books, the Phoenix New Times wrote, [...] "Meyer's fandom {{is reminiscent of}} Harry Potter mania." [...] The Daily Telegraph described Twilight as the [...] "spiritual successor to Harry Potter". Rebekah Bradford of The Post and Courier stated that the series has a [...] "huge crossover appeal much like the Harry Potter books before them." [...] According to the Daily Telegraph, [...] "Stephenie Meyer, in particular, has achieved incredible success across all the English-speaking nations and Europe and many will say that her Twilight series has filled the hole left by Harry Potter." [...] Meyer has responded to such comparisons, saying, [...] "It's terribly flattering to be compared to her, but there's {{never going to be}} another J. K. Rowling; that's a phenomenon that's not gonna happen again", however noting that [...] "you can compare my fans to her fans more easily [...] I do think that we both have people who are just really really enthusiastic, and will come miles to <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> be involved, and everybody really cares about our characters." ...|$|E
500|$|A San Francisco Chronicle {{review of}} a 2012 concert judged her singing [...] "an {{impressive}} thing to witness, and Evancho's technical precision and enormous range only serve {{to make it seem}} less fluky", but felt that [...] "every selection sounded alike". A reviewer for The Denver Post wrote that Evancho [...] "displayed her famous combo of poise and articulation", but he noted [...] "the burden of being a kid soprano, a true phenomenon. People pay a lot to <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> orchestras line up to get you on their stage. But still folks wonder if you really comprehend your life; if you shouldn’t be home ... eating ice cream. ... And yet they rise to their feet, yet again, as you finish." [...] A Naples Daily News review stated: [...] "Her poise. Her control. Her range. ... Her voice and her performance exhausted all of the superlatives in the dictionary." [...] In 2013, an Atlanta reviewer commented: [...] "Her pure and well-formed vowel sounds touched the hearts of everyone at the concert." [...] A review in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution called Evancho [...] "awesomely talented" [...] and [...] "technically flawless". The Buffalo News reviewer wrote: [...] "there is a poignancy to the sound of this mature voice coming out of this child. Her high notes are a joy." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Tribunal {{heard from}} retired Garda Chief Superintendent Tom Curran, who {{was based in}} Monaghan {{at the time of}} the killings. He stated that in 1988 an {{informer}} told him of an IRA death threat against Buchanan. The man had allegedly said: [...] "There's a fella crossing the border there to <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> he is going to be shot." [...] Curran — who had met Buchanan many times and regarded him as a friend — was worried and duly informed Eugene Crowley, the assistant commissioner of crime and security at Garda headquarters in Dublin, about the threat. Curran never told Buchanan about the threat as he didn't want Buchanan to think that the Garda Síochána was trying to stop him coming to the Republic. In 1987, Buchanan had called to Curran's office to discuss RUC concerns about the Garda detective sergeant at Dundalk station who was [...] "unnecessarily associating" [...] with the IRA. Buchanan asked Curran to convey his message to Garda headquarters, which he did in person. Assistant Commissioner Crowley (now deceased) did not, however, seem interested in what Curran had to say about the possible collusion. This detective sergeant was the same man whom Breen had discussed with Sgt Alan Mains before setting out for Dundalk. This man was also on first name terms with the then RUC Chief Constable Sir John Hermon. Breen's widow June maintained that many times before the ambush, Breen had given her instructions that in the event of his death Hermon was not to be allowed to attend his funeral.|$|E
