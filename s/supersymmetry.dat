5|$|Another {{important}} theoretical {{idea that}} {{plays a role}} in M-theory is <b>supersymmetry.</b> This is a mathematical relation that exists in certain physical theories between a class of particles called bosons and a class of particles called fermions. Roughly speaking, fermions are the constituents of matter, while bosons mediate interactions between particles. In theories with <b>supersymmetry,</b> each boson has a counterpart which is a fermion, and vice versa. When <b>supersymmetry</b> is imposed as a local symmetry, one automatically obtains a quantum mechanical theory that includes gravity. Such a theory is called a supergravity theory.|$|E
5|$|A {{theory of}} strings that {{incorporates}} {{the idea of}} <b>supersymmetry</b> is called a superstring theory. There are several different versions of superstring theory which are all subsumed within the M-theory framework. At low energies, the superstring theories are approximated by supergravity in ten spacetime dimensions. Similarly, M-theory is approximated at low energies by supergravity in eleven dimensions.|$|E
5|$|Although the AdS/CFT {{correspondence}} {{is often}} useful {{for studying the}} properties of black holes, most of the black holes considered {{in the context of}} AdS/CFT are physically unrealistic.

40|$|In {{extended}} supergravity theories {{there are}} $p$-brane solutions preserving different numbers of <b>supersymmetries,</b> {{depending on the}} charges, the spacetime dimension {{and the number of}} original <b>supersymmetries</b> (8, 16 or 32).

5|$|New {{concepts}} and mathematical tools provided fresh insights into general relativity, {{giving rise to}} a period in the 1960s–70s {{now known as the}} golden age of general relativity. In the mid-1970s, physicists began studying higher-dimensional theories combining general relativity with <b>supersymmetry,</b> the so-called supergravity theories.|$|E
5|$|One {{attempt to}} {{overcome}} these limitations is string theory, a quantum theory not of point particles, but of minute one-dimensional extended objects. The theory {{promises to be a}} unified description of all particles and interactions, including gravity; the price to pay is unusual features such as six extra dimensions of space in addition to the usual three. In what is called the second superstring revolution, it was conjectured that both string theory and a unification of general relativity and <b>supersymmetry</b> known as supergravity form part of a hypothesized eleven-dimensional model known as M-theory, which would constitute a uniquely defined and consistent theory of quantum gravity.|$|E
5|$|There are notable {{differences}} between the world described by string theory and the everyday world. In everyday life, there are three familiar dimensions of space (up/down, left/right, and forward/backward), and there is one dimension of time (later/earlier). Thus, {{in the language of}} modern physics, one says that spacetime is four-dimensional. One of the peculiar features of string theory is that it requires extra dimensions of spacetime for its mathematical consistency. In superstring theory, the version of the theory that incorporates a theoretical idea called <b>supersymmetry,</b> there are six extra dimensions of spacetime in addition to the four that are familiar from everyday experience.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} version of string theory was bosonic string theory, but this version described only bosons, {{a class of}} particles which transmit forces between the matter particles, or fermions. Bosonic string theory was eventually superseded by theories called superstring theories. These theories describe both bosons and fermions, and they incorporate a theoretical idea called <b>supersymmetry.</b> This is a mathematical relation that exists in certain physical theories between the bosons and fermions. In theories with <b>supersymmetry,</b> each boson has a counterpart which is a fermion, and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|LQG {{differs from}} string theory {{in that it}} is {{formulated}} in 3 and 4 dimensions and without <b>supersymmetry</b> or Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions, while the latter requires both to be true. There is no experimental evidence to date that confirms string theory's predictions of <b>supersymmetry</b> and Kaluza–Klein extra dimensions. In a 2003 paper A dialog on quantum gravity, Carlo Rovelli regards the fact LQG is formulated in 4 dimensions and without <b>supersymmetry</b> as a strength of the theory as it represents the most parsimonious explanation, consistent with current experimental results, over its rival string/M-theory. Proponents of string theory will often point to the fact that, among other things, it demonstrably reproduces the established theories of general relativity and quantum field theory in the appropriate limits, which Loop Quantum Gravity has struggled to do. In that sense string theory's connection to established physics may be considered more reliable and less speculative, at the mathematical level. Loop Quantum Gravity has nothing to say about the matter(fermions) in the universe.|$|E
25|$|In {{continuous}} time dynamical systems, chaos is {{the phenomenon}} of the spontaneous breakdown of topological <b>supersymmetry</b> which is an intrinsic property of evolution operators of all stochastic and deterministic (partial) differential equations. This picture of dynamical chaos works not only for deterministic models but also for models with external noise, which is an important generalization from the physical point of view because in reality all dynamical systems experience influence from their stochastic environments. Within this picture, the long-range dynamical behavior associated with chaotic dynamics, e.g., the butterfly effect, is a consequence of the Goldstone's theorem in the application to the spontaneous topological <b>supersymmetry</b> breaking.|$|E
