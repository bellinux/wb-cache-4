Even each backfill <b>sand</b> <b>specimen</b> particle size is difference, but calculation data shows that the particle size of each <b>sand</b> <b>specimen</b> has preferable fractal feature, the <b>sand</b> <b>specimen</b> particle size distribution has remarkable fractal structure by the linear fitted results of the sand specimens. The fractal relationship of strength and particle size distribution shows that with the increased of fractal dimension, the strength of backfill is decreased, {{that is to say}} there is negative correlation, the main cause is that the higher parameter D of the fractal dimension, the higher fine-grained content and more non-uniform of the particle size distribution, especially for the thinner full tailings, if properly increasing the content of slightly crude particles, the strength of backfill will be certainly improved to some extent.

An air pluviation technique is widely used to achieve uniform and repeatable <b>sand</b> <b>specimens.</b> Many of the previously developed air pluviation setups were stationary in nature, and these setups have inherent limitations, which do not allow the preparation of large, uniform sand beds. In this study, a mechanized traveling pluviator (MTP) is developed, which has two main features, including a freely movable hopper and rigid tube made up of Plexiglas to observe the sand flow during pluviation. This study aims at understanding the effect of the number of diffuser sieves, deposition intensity (DI), and height fall (HF) on the relative density (RD) and uniformity of <b>sand</b> <b>specimens.</b> The uniformity of a sand bed is verified by conducting cone penetration tests (CPTs) using a miniature cone.

40|$|The {{undrained}} shearing {{properties of}} sand permeated with bentonite suspensions are studied {{to investigate the}} use of bentonite suspensions for static liquefaction mitigation. Rheological tests {{are performed to evaluate}} the penetrability and the thixotropic strength recovery of the suspensions. The results show that the initial viscosity and the yield stress are reduced significantly by adding 2 % sodium pyrophosphate (SPP) to 10 % bentonite suspensions. Moreover, the yield stress and the viscosity gradually increase with time due to the thixotropic nature of the bentonite suspensions. The shearing response of the permeated soil is observed by consolidated undrained triaxial tests on loose Ottawa <b>sand</b> <b>specimens</b> permeated with bentonite suspensions. The stress-strain response of the permeated specimens shows no drop in stress after the undrained instability state as compared to the response of clean <b>sand</b> <b>specimens.</b> Additionally, the undrained shear response of the permeated <b>sand</b> <b>specimens</b> displays no cohesion and the same friction angle as clean sand. This indicates that the sand fabric is relatively unaffected by the pressures applied to permeate the bentonite suspension.

40|$|High {{resolution}} neutron (13. 7 m/voxel) and X-ray (11. 2 m/voxel) {{tomography imaging}} of partially water saturated sand specimens was performed at Heimholte Zentrum Berlin (HZB). Two different sand grain morphologies (round and angular) were used. Partially saturated silica sand is a three-phase material consisting of solid (Silica: SiO 2), gas (air), and liquid (water) phases. Due to different attenuation characteristics of neutrons and X-rays to these three phases of interest, the neutron and X-ray images {{presented in this}} paper provided unique and complementary information. While the water phase contrast is well-identified with the cold neutron images without using a contrast agent, the detailed structure of the silica sand phase is much clearly shown in the X-ray images due to low attenuation of the air/water phases to X-rays. A detailed description of neutron and X-ray tomography for visualizing and quantifying microstructure of an assemblage of sand grains is provided in this paper. An automatic approach to register the dual modality image information in the same coordinate is also demonstrated, and a technique to match different resolutions from neutron and X-ray imaging techniques is addressed.

40|$|A {{constitutive}} model {{to describe the}} cyclic undrained behavior of saturated sand is presented. The increments in volumetric strain during undrained loading, which are equal to zero, are assumed to consist of increments due to dilatancy and increments due to consolidation/swelling.

Based {{on the results of}} drained tests, the increments in volumetric strain due to consolidation/swelling are evaluated by assuming that the quasi-elastic bulk modulus can be expressed as a unique function of the mean effective principal stress. On the other hand, in evaluating the increments in volumetric strain due to dilatancy, a normalized stress–plastic shear strain relationship is employed in combination with a novel empirical stress–dilatancy relationship derived for torsional shear loading.

The motivation for the design comes from the need to estimate the failure-load of mesoscale cemented <b>sand</b> <b>specimens</b> in situ, which is not possible with traditional devices used for large specimens or very small specimens. The composite compliant device, developed in this work, consists of two compliant mechanisms: a force-amplifying compliant mechanism (FaCM) to amplify sufficiently the force exerted by hand in order to break the specimen and a displacement-amplifying compliant mechanism (DaCM) to enable measurement of the force using a proximity sensor. The two mechanisms are designed using the selection-maps technique to amplify the force up to 100 N by about a factor of 3 and measure the force with a resolution of 15 mN. The composite device, made using a FaCM, a DaCM, and a Hall effect-based proximity sensor, was tested on mesoscale cemented <b>sand</b> <b>specimens</b> that were 10 mm in diameter and 20 mm in length.

40|$|Dune sands {{characterized}} by a susceptibility to large deformations can be a useful pavement construction material if reinforced or treated with cement. Sand can be easily reinforced with synthetic fibers to increase its stiffness and load-carrying capacity. This study was undertaken to investigate the resilient behavior of polypropylene fiber-reinforced sand. Triaxial, California bearing ratio (CBR), and resilient modulus tests were conducted on fiber-reinforced sand as well as unreinforced sand, and the results compared. The optimum fiber content {{was found to be}} 0. 4 % by weight. The triaxial shear strength of the fiber-reinforced <b>sand</b> <b>specimens</b> revealed that there were two modes of failure, fiber-sand bond failure and fiber failure, and the internal friction angle depended on the mode of failure. Synthetic fiber-reinforced sand has greater CBR values than those of unreinforced sand. The effect of fiber reinforcement on the resilient modulus, MR, values was investigated in terms of resilient modulus model parameters.
