5|$|Carl von Sickingen {{researched}} platinum {{extensively in}} 1772. He <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> malleable platinum by alloying it with gold, dissolving the alloy in hot aqua regia, precipitating the platinum with ammonium chloride, igniting the ammonium chloroplatinate, and hammering the resulting finely divided platinum {{to make it}} cohere. Franz Karl Achard made the first platinum crucible in 1784. He worked with the platinum by fusing it with arsenic, then later volatilizing the arsenic.|$|E

Even in lackluster films, however, he nevertheless often <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> art {{of what might}} be called hackwork. Still, for all his tireless work in the studios, Manne's labor of love was his contribution to jazz as an American art form, to which he had dedicated himself since his youth and continued to work at almost to the last day of his life.|$|E

5|$|Merwin <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> Startling {{popular and}} successful, and the {{bimonthly}} schedule was resumed in 1947. At {{the start of}} 1952 Startling switched to a monthly schedule; this was unusual in that Startling was notionally junior to Thrilling Wonder, its sister magazine, which remained bimonthly. Merwin left shortly before this switch, in order {{to spend more time}} on his own writing. He was replaced by Samuel Mines, who had worked with Standard's Western magazines, though he was a science fiction aficionado.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, {{research}} {{started in}} the Soviet Union and the US on the growth of diamond by pyrolysis of hydrocarbon gases at the relatively low temperature of 800°C. This low-pressure process is known as chemical vapor deposition (CVD). William G. Eversole reportedly achieved vapor deposition of diamond over diamond substrate in 1953, {{but it was not}} reported until 1962. Diamond film deposition was independently reproduced by Angus and coworkers in 1968 and by Deryagin and Fedoseev in 1970. Whereas Eversole and Angus used large, expensive, single-crystal diamonds as substrates, Deryagin and Fedoseev <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> diamond films on non-diamond materials (silicon and metals), which led to massive research on inexpensive diamond coatings in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} Treaty of Schönbrunn was {{the harshest}} that France had imposed on Austria in recent memory. Metternich and Archduke Charles had {{the preservation of}} the Habsburg Empire as their fundamental goal, and to this end the former <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> Napoleon seek more modest goals in return for promises of Franco-Austrian peace and friendship. Nevertheless, while most of the hereditary lands remained part of Habsburg territories, France received Carinthia, Carniola, and the Adriatic ports, while Galicia was given to the Poles and the Salzburg area of the Tyrol went to the Bavarians. Austria lost over three million subjects, about one-fifth of her total population, {{as a result of these}} territorial changes.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{her return}} from Rome, Violante Beatrice and the Electress Anna Maria Luisa {{decided to do}} {{something}} about Gian Gastone's public image and the Ruspanti, his entourage. In order to distract him from the Ruspanti, Violante Beatrice threw banquets, to which she invited the foremost members of Tuscan society. The Grand Duke's behaviour, vomiting, belching and cracking rude jokes, literally sent the guests scrambling to leave. The Electress was more fortunate for her part. She <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> Gian Gastone appear on Saint John the Baptist's day, 1729. However, during the ceremony, the Grand Duke became so intoxicated that he had to be dragged back to his palace, the Pitti, on a litter.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the inner}} {{security}} zone, the Schutzstreifen, a further 743people (15%) were {{arrested by the}} guards. 48people (1%) were stopped– i.e. killed or injured– by landmines and 43people (0.9%) by SM-70 directional mines on the fence. A further 67people (1.35%) were intercepted at the fence (shot and/or arrested). A total of 229people– just 4.6% of attempted escapees, representing less than one in twenty– made it across the fence. Of these, the largest number (129, or 55% of successful escapees) <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> it across the fence in unmined sectors. 89people (39% of escapees) managed to cross both the minefields and the fence, but just 12people (6% of the total) succeeded in getting past the SM-70s booby-trap mines on the fences.|$|E
5|$|Captain Ernest J. King, {{who later}} rose {{to serve as}} the Chief of Naval Operations during World War II, assumed command on 20 June 1930. Lexington was assigned, {{together}} with Saratoga, to defend the west coast of Panama against a hypothetical invader during Fleet Problem XII in February 1931. While each carrier was able to inflict some damage on the invasion convoys, the enemy forces <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> a landing. Shortly afterward, all three carriers transferred to the Caribbean to conduct further maneuvers. The most important of these was when Saratoga successfully defended the Caribbean side of the Panama Canal from an attack by Lexington. Rear Admiral Joseph M. Reeves baited a trap for King with a destroyer and scored a kill on Lexington on 22 March while the latter's aircraft were still searching for Saratoga.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, Wheeler and Ridlon {{established}} the Jim Thorpe Foundation and gained {{support from the}} U.S.Congress. Armed with this support and evidence from 1912 proving that Thorpe's disqualification had occurred after the 30-day time period allowed by Olympics rules, they <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> {{the case to the}} IOC. In October1982, the IOC Executive Committee approved Thorpe's reinstatement. In an unusual ruling, they declared that Thorpe was co-champion with Ferdinand Bie and Wieslander, although both of these athletes had always said they considered Thorpe to be the only champion. In a ceremony on January 18, 1983, the IOC presented two of Thorpe's children, Gale and Bill, with commemorative medals. Thorpe's original medals had been held in museums, but they had been stolen and have never been recovered. Although Thorpe is listed as a gold medalist by the IOC, his results from 1912 have not been restored to the official Olympic records.|$|E
5|$|Saratoga was assigned, {{together}} with Lexington, {{to defend the}} west coast of Panama against a hypothetical invader during Fleet Problem XII in February 1931. While each carrier was able to inflict some damage on the invasion convoys, the enemy forces <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> a landing. All three carriers then transferred to the Caribbean to conduct further maneuvers, including one in which Saratoga successfully defended the Caribbean side of the Panama Canal from a staged attack by Lexington. Rear Admiral Joseph M. Reeves baited a trap for Lexingtons captain, Ernest J. King, with a destroyer and scored a kill on Lexington on 22 March while the latter's aircraft were still searching for Saratoga. The 1932 movie Hell Divers was filmed aboard the ship and starred Wallace Beery and a young Clark Gable as a pair of competing aircraft gunners assigned to VF-1B.|$|E
5|$|From 8 to 10 October 1939, Gneisenau and Scharnhorst {{had been}} spotted by Coastal Command in the North Sea. However, they were {{incapable}} of inflicting {{damage to the}} ships. When Bomber Command arrived they could not locate the vessels as {{they had not been}} trained to locate enemy vessels at sea, or attack moving targets. Coastal Command also failed to detect the breakout of Scharnhorst and Gneisenau during Operation Berlin in 1941. The German warships succeeded in sinking 22 merchant ships, although all were sailing independently. However, after their return to port, on 6 April, and being located by a reconnaissance Spitfire, Coastal Command's No. 22 Squadron, from St. Eval in Cornwall launched a strike by six Beauforts. Only one, piloted by Flying Officer Kenneth Campbell <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> a torpedo-run. With 250 anti-aircraft guns, flak ships and Gneisenaus own guns, Campbell and his crew were shot down and killed, but not before the torpedo struck the ship on the stern below the waterline, putting it out of action for months. Campbell was awarded the Victoria Cross. The other members of his crew were Sergeants J.P Scott, W. Mullis, R.W Hillman.|$|E

5|$|In the {{beginning}} Reitz {{found it hard}} to make a living, as competition among lawyers in Cape Town was quite severe at this time. Nevertheless, he <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> a name for himself, due to his sharp legal mind and his social intelligence. Being part of the western Circuit Court of the Cape Colony gave him a lot of experience in a very short time. At the same time, Reitz nurtured his political interests by writing lead articles for the Cape Argus newspaper, for which he also reported on the proceedings of the Cape Parliament and acted as deputy editor. In 1870 Reitz moved his legal practice to Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State. The discovery of diamonds {{on the banks of the}} Vaal River, Reitz thought, would lead to a growth of legal work and enable him to set up a thriving practice. This was not to be, however, and after a few months Reitz left Bloemfontein to set up as a diamond prospector in Griqualand West, where he bought a small claim near Pniel from the Berlin Missionary Society. This enterprise also proved unsuccessful, and again after only a few months Reitz returned to Cape Town. This time, his Cape Town law practice was successful, ironically because of the British annexation of the Orange Free State diamondfields (1871) and the economic prosperity this emanated for the Cape Colony.|$|E
5|$|Only part of Captain King’s force, {{including}} 35 of Lieutenant Angus's 70 sailors, <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> {{a landing}} at the Red House. Under {{fire from the}} defenders, the invaders charged Lieutenant Lamont’s detachment of the 49th Regiment. The sailors, armed with pikes and swords, closed in for hand-to-hand fighting. Lamont's troops drove back the attackers three times but King made a fourth assault which hit the British left flank and overwhelmed them; capturing Lamont and killing, taking or dispersing all of his men. The victorious Americans {{set fire to the}} post, spiked the guns and set off back to the landing-point, where they expected their boats to have re-landed in order to evacuate them. However, in the moonless darkness, King’s force became dispersed and split into two parties: one led by King and the other by Lieutenant Angus. Angus returned to the landing-point and found only four of the party’s ten boats there. Unaware that the six missing boats had not in fact landed, Angus assumed that King had already departed, and he re-crossed the river in the remaining boats. When King’s party reached the landing-point, they found themselves stranded. A search downriver found two unattended British boats, in which King sent half of his men, and the prisoners that he had captured, over the Niagara while he waited with his 30 remaining men for more boats to come from Buffalo and pick him up.|$|E
