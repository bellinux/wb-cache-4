40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{investigation}} {{and analysis of}} strength characteristics development of cement stabilized courses made from mine refuse materials from Rudnany. Cement stabilized courses made from the material from the dump Patoraka (graphite) - Rudnany B and the dump Zimna (diabases) - Rudnany C underwent a long-term investigation by destructive and non-destructive methods. Long-term investigation were carried out on testing beams (10 x 10 x 40) cm 3 in laboratory conditions. From the reported results follows that the investigated materials are suitable for the pavement foundation of roads. It is also obvious that for the investigated cement stabilized courses, for which the mixture composition is known and which were treated in the same way, {{it is possible to}} determine working characteristics with required accuracy and as a consequence to predict the development of strength characteristics of these mine refuse materials. When the cement stabilized courses are built in the pavement foundation of roads and highways, the asphalt layer are laid upon them after some time and the roads are opened to traffic. This raises the question about {{the way in which the}} strength increasing in time influences the service life of roads and whether this process results in the formation of shrinking cracks in the cement stabilized courses which are copied in the wearing course. At the implementation of cement <b>stabilized</b> <b>course</b> in the pavement foundation of a road it is therefore necessary to include in the technological process of road construction also treatment of these courses until the asphalt layers are laid upon them...|$|E

40|$|Cold {{in place}} {{recycling}} of asphalt pavements with foamed bitumen is a technique traditionally used for base course or subbase construction on low or medium volume roads, but in some recent publications {{it has been used}} on heavy trafficked roads to build base courses upon which the bynder course is laid directly. For the last type of applications, improvements of material stiffness are required and they are obtained by increasing the cement content which has the positive effect of reducing permanent deformation, but the negative effect to make the material less flexible. The aim {{of this paper is to}} identify a specific design criteria for this type of applications, which is based on the results of experimental tests carried out on these materials, and which try to take into account undesired effects of the high cement content on material performance.

40|$|The present work {{discusses}} {{the basis of}} different manner of agggregate mixture stabilization of the base course of the road construction. At this point my focus is based on cement stabilization as the one mainly used in road building. Advantages and disadvantages of mechanization used for aggregate mixture stabilizing are at greater length depicted, where inovative recyclator Wirtgen 2500 S has its own special place. Used materials for granulated mixture or compound and characteristic of organic (bituminous) and inorganic (hydraulic) binders are presented. Preparation procedure for aggregate mixtures and compounds are clearly defined and corroborated with example in chapter "Optimization structure", where the main goal was to obtain the optimal hydraulic bounding for the cement stabilization production. The bound material has to meet all the valid and expected new regulation and {{the preparation of the}} cement stabilization must be in accordance with all the regulated characteristic. Optimal choice of binder type and its proportion is at this point very important as the main problem of technological procedure would be mainly accurate dosage and adequate homogeneity of small amounts of binder. The main problem appears with incorrect dosage of binder quantaties: when binders are overdosed cracks appear because of too high compressive strength, whereas underdosing influences on functionalism of a pavement structure that can not meet all the expected traffic loads.

40|$|In {{light of}} the {{increasing}} cost of hot-mix asphalt (HMA) mixtures and the limited availability of good materials, cold in-place recycling (CIR) offers an attractive alternative for rehabilitating asphalt pavements. Because of its limited performance history and the unavailability of a standard mix-design procedure, the use of CIR mixtures has been limited to low-and medium-volume roads. For more than a decade, many highway agencies have experimented with or used CIR mixtures and reported numerous successes. The Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT) is currently using CIR on low- and medium-volume roads. The CIR layer is treated as a <b>stabilized</b> base <b>course</b> followed by a thin HMA overlay. As part of this program, NDOT developed a mix-design procedure based on the Hveem mix-design method to establish the optimum moisture and emulsion contents. The design procedure evaluates the moisture sensitivity of the CIR mixture and determines the need for lime treatment of the CIR mix. The basic concept of the mix design is to assess {{the ability of the}} CIR process in providing a flexible and stable mix that can withstand the combined action of traffic loads and environment. The designed CIR mixtures were implemented on three field projects and showed excellent performance, which led NDOT to construct additional CIR projects. PublishedN/...|$|R

40|$|Visual motion {{processing}} enables moving {{fruit flies}} to <b>stabilize</b> their <b>course</b> and altitude and to approach selected objects. Earlier attempts to identify task-specific pathways between two photoreceptor systems (R 1 - 6, R 7 + 8) and three steering parameters (wingstroke asymmetry, abdomen deflection, hindleg deflection) attributed course control and object fixation to R 1 - 6 mediated simultaneous reactions of these parameters. The present investigation includes first results from fixed flying or freely walking ninaE 17 mutants which cannot synthesize the R 1 - 6 photoreceptor-specific opsin. Retention of about 12 {{percent of the}} normal course control and about 58 percent of the object fixation in these flies suggests partial input sharing for both responses and, possibly, a specialization for large-field (R 1 - 6) and small-field (R 7 + 8) motion. Such signals must be combined to perceive relative motion between an object and its background. The combining links found in larger species might explain a previously neglected interdependence of course control and object fixation in Drosophila. Output decomposition revealed an unexpected orchestration of steering. Wingstroke asymmetry and abdomen deflection do not contribute in fixed proportions to the yaw torque of the flight system. Different steering modes seem to be selected according to their actual efficiency under closed-loop conditions and {{to the degree of}} intended turning.

40|$|There {{are ongoing}} discussions {{concerning}} {{the risk of}} escalating immunotherapy in MS. The Objective of this work is the determination of safety and long-term efficacy in MX-treated patients. Mitoxantrone (MX), a synthetic cytotoxic drug, is an intravenous administered immunosuppressant that inhibits T-cell, B-cell and macrophage proliferation. It {{is known to be}} active on proliferative and non-proliferative cells and inhibits DNA replication and RNA synthesis. Furthermore MX is a topoisomerase-II activity-inhibitor and interferes with DNA repairing mechanisms. The immunosuppressive effects contain both the reduction of the production of proinflammatory cytokines and inhibition of the macrophage-mediated myelin degradation. Due to this issue, MX is able to determine a broad immunosuppression. A retrospective monocentric review of patients treated with MX from 01. 01. 1990 to 01. 01. 2011 by standard protocol using the data of our MS-centrum was performed. Patients were treated mainly every 3 months over a 2 -year period of time with a cumulative dose of 96 mg/m² body surface area. The data were analysed concerning the development of the trimonthly assessed EDSS-Score, severe side effects during therapy (hospitalization) and long term side effects such as cardiotoxicity and leukaemia. Furthermore, gender, the year of starting and the patients age in years at beginning of the MX-therapy, the duration of illness until start with MX, the EDSS-Scores (baseline, end of therapy, 1 year, 5 years and 10 years after last MX-application) and the occurring side effects were documented. Referring to the results, 406 patients (male 143, female 263) treated with MX from 1990 to 2011 were reviewed. Mean baseline age at start of the MX-therapy was 44, 3 years, mean follow-up-time was 6, 3 years and the mean duration of MS-disease at start of MTX-therapy was 10, 6 years. The administered mean cumulative dose of MX was 81, 7 mg/m². The mean difference of EDSS-score one year after end of MX was 0, 33 for male patients and 0, 03 for female patients. Five years after last MX-application the difference was 0, 84 for males and 0, 51 for females. There was a significant difference in t-Test after one and five years (p=< 0, 001; p= 0, 018). The multiple regression analysis identified gender as a significant predictor for EDSS-Changes. Female patients presented with a significant more stable EDSS-course after MX-application. Furthermore, patients with a higher yearly progression rate before MX-start showed significant differences in EDSS-score: they showed more frequently a stable or improved EDSS in comparison to patients with a lower progression rate per year (after one year 71, 7 % vs. 62, 0 %, p= 0, 038; after five years 46, 1 % vs. 34, 4 %, p= 0, 046). In 6, 9 % of the 406 MX-patients (yearly incidence rate of 0, 6 %) hospitalizing infections were the most common side effect, followed by cardial complications in 6, 4 % of the patients. A therapy-associated leukemia was not diagnosed in our 406 patients. Application of interferon-ß after end of MX <b>stabilized</b> the <b>course</b> of disease after five and ten years significantly. MX is an effective therapeutical approach, <b>stabilizing</b> the <b>course</b> of the disease. Due to the known side effects an accurate risk-benefit-evaluation is needed...|$|R

The initial performance of two projects on US 287 constructed around 2000 in the Amarillo District {{has been found to be}} satisfactory. However, the Yoakum District has reported problems with asphalt emulsion for base work in a project on FM 237. The preliminary conclusion from these trials has been that asphalt emulsion may not perform well in the high humidity/high rainfall areas like east Texas. On the other hand, using calcium-based additives to <b>stabilize</b> base <b>courses</b> in road construction has been a common practice in most TxDOT districts. It is expected that the blend of calcium-based additives with asphalt emulsion (dual stabilization) will produce a base which has an optimum combination of strength, stiffness, moisture resistance and flexibility. In this case, the calcium-based stabilizer may reduce the plasticity of the base fines making it a more friable material that accepts well the blending with emulsions. TxDOT has drafted a special specification for the use of asphalt emulsions treatment in road mixing. In this project, the trial version of the TxDOT special specification is evaluated. The output of this research project includes: laboratory test procedure for mix design with dual stabilization, a guideline for the construction of bases with dual stabilization, and results from a series of parametric studies that show which parameters may have significant impacts on the engineering properties of emulsion-treated base materials and on the performance of emulsion-treated bases. ...|$|R

The argument is developed through the close analysis of an episode of interaction from a high school English classroom in which one student, Latanya, was constructed by the other participants as being “ghetto. ” I interpret how constructing and relating multiple identity artifacts—including a banner displayed in the classroom, descriptions of the Black community, embodied spaces, and represented home geographies—serve to define and stabilize identity.

As {{a result}} of {{industrial}} activities along with increasing world population and technological developments, unserviceable materials named as “waste” increase day by day and affect environment negatively. Various researches conducted associated with waste management topics {{in order to reduce}} generated and recycled wastes. Commencement of extinction of the current resources, recycling of waste and evaluating as an alternative raw material source have extended the studies. Arising from production quantity in million degrees and generated as {{a result of}} industrial activities, recycling with raw material source usage in different industries, waste disposal, cost reduction and efficient source usage constitutes an importance. Iron and steel industry products are constituted fundamental raw materials of industrial sectors. It is not only been vital part of the society, but also strategically significance from the point of the countries in sectors such as construction, infrastructure, machinery and automotive with great strength and durability. Steel production is growing day by day all over the world. Only in 2014, 34 million tons steel produced in Turkey while 1, 662 million tons produced around the world. Both in Turkey and in the world, 70 % of steel productions is performed with EAF furnace. Waste and by products are comprised 90 % of slag, dust and sludge in iron and steel industry. Iron and steel slag constitutes most of the waste product of iron and steel production. Nowadays, production of 1 ton liquid steel generates 169 kg Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) slag, 275 kg blast furnace slag in integrated facilities and 126 kg basic furnace slag. Every year, over 400 million tons iron and steel slag is produced around the world. In the light of this data, considered that steel productions and their increments, obtained slag could be regained as a raw material source for various industries. One of the sectors that used a major level of raw material is construction sector. Especially, in road constructions in which extra raw material needed, 95 % of materials constitutes from aggregate. Consumed aggregate sources increase demand for new aggregate mines (fields) each day passing. This situation also results in an increase of costs. The use of iron and steel slag as a road construction material benefit not only the environment, but also the financial way. Due to the very high costs for landfilling, many solutions have found for recycling. Thereby, use of slag generated during production of iron and steel on road construction besides its contribution to the environment, with efficient source usage it presents an economic solution. While iron and steel production proceeding on integrated facilities, some solid wastes occur such as blast furnace slag, steel slag, coal ash and dust. Disposing of these solid wastes may cause soil pollution, ground and surface water pollution. Emerged slags seems like “waste” in iron and steel industry, have constituted major part of the waste and by products. Slags defined as marketable products along with increment their usage area. New execution areas enhanced while growth in economical, environmental and social advantages of slag use. Iron and steel slag is being marketable product with increasing usage possibilities. Slag is widely used in construction sector especially in cement paste, concrete mixture, hydraulic structures and road constructions. Steel plant slag is considered to be very suitable for road constructions based on strength, stability, abrasion, porosity and water absorption properties. Some investigations are being made about steel plant slag if it can be used as sub-base material in road constructions with its great strength properties. In this study, availability of EAF slag, which is generated as waste product of iron and steel production, was investigated as artificial aggregate in cement <b>stabilized</b> base <b>course</b> of flexible pavement. All of the experiments have done comparatively with natural aggregate within the scope of Republic of Turkey General Directorate of Highways Technical Specification published in 2013. First of all, importance and goal of this study were explained literally. Then, general information about flexible pavement layers was asserted. Also, significant processing steps and types of iron and steel production, which are blast furnace, basic oxygen furnace and electric arc furnace, were explicated. Iron and steel industry was revealed with numerical data both for Turkey and world-wide. Some information have given about generation of slag which is derived from iron and steel production, types of slags, physical and chemical properties of slags. Their generation stages and reactions are given in 4 main topics as blast furnace slag, basic oxygen furnace slag, electric arc furnace slag and secondary metallurgical slag. General usage area and usage ratios were stated in terms of slag types. Where the experimental studies handled after this section, the usage of EAF slag was investigated in cement <b>stabilized</b> base <b>course</b> of flexible pavement. Certain information detailed about physical properties and layer stabilities of aggregate can be used in cement <b>stabilized</b> base <b>course</b> according to Republic of Turkey General Directorate of Highways Technical Specification published in 2013. Numerous experiments performed such as density and absorption of aggregate test, Los Angeles abrasion and impact test, flatness index test, determination of organic matter test, methylene blue test, clay lumps and friable particles in aggregates test, durability of freeze effect test, liquid limit test and plastic limit test to determine physical properties of EAF slag and natural aggregate within the scope of Republic of Turkey General Directorate of Highways Technical Specification published in 2013. As a consequence, all assessments were made according to experimental test results. Usage of EAF slag was investigated in cement <b>stabilized</b> base <b>course</b> of flexible pavement. If slag is carefully treated beginning at the EAF furnace to the slag plant, it can be a useful and competitive product for road construction and several other applications. Certain suggestions were made about usage of EAF slag in road constructions. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This study {{demonstrates}} {{the use of}} Class F fly ash in combination with lime or lime kiln dust in the full depth reclamation (FDR) of asphalt pavements. FDR, {{in the context of}} this paper, is a process of pulverizing a predetermined amount of flexible pavement that is structurally deficient, blending it with chemical additives and water, and compacting it in place to construct a new <b>stabilized</b> base <b>course.</b> Test sections of two structurally deficient asphalt pavements were reclaimed using Class F fly ash in combination with lime and lime kiln dust. In addition, control sections were constructed using cement, cement and emulsion, lime kiln dust and emulsion, and mill and fill. The service performance and structural behavior of the FDR pavement test sections were monitored to determine how the fly ash sections compared to other more traditional pavement rehabilitation techniques. Service performance and structural behavior were determined with the use of sensors embedded in the road and Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) tests. Monitoring results of the FWD tests conducted up to 2 years after reclamation show that the cement, fly ash+LKD, and fly ash+lime sections exhibited two year resilient modulus values comparable to open graded cement stabilized aggregates (more than 750 ksi). The cement treatment resulted in a significant increase in resilient modulus within 3 weeks of construction and beyond this curing time, the stiffness increase was slow. On the other hand, the fly ash+LKD and fly ash+lime test sections indicated slower shorter-term increase in stiffness. The fly ash+LKD and fly ash+lime section average resilient modulus values at two years after construction were in excess of 800 ksi. Additional longer-term testing data will be available from ongoing pavement performance and environmental condition data collection at the two pavement sites.
