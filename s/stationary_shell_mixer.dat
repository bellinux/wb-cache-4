40|$|The {{revolving}} vane (RV) compressor is {{a relatively}} new rotary compressor design and many of its performance characteristics would have to be evaluated. Vibration of compressors is one of these aspects and this paper presents the theoretical analysis for the vibration characteristics of the RV compressor. The analysis is done by dividing the compressor into two components – the rotational vibration of the cylinder-rotor assembly, and the resulting torsional twist of the <b>stationary</b> <b>shell</b> housing. The unique approach of using Lagrange’s equations to formulate the equation of motion for the complex cylinder-rotor assembly is presented here, along with preliminary simulated results...|$|R
40|$|A {{torque meter}} {{comprising}} hollow-keyed, {{input and output}} female shafts adapted to receive the male shafts of the power source and machine respectively. Each shaft has a circular flange whose face is perpendicular to the center line of the shafts. Each flange has a plurality of equally spaced cylindrical recesses machined into the inside face thereto adapted to receive conical inserts therein. Balls are contained by the conical inserts and transmit the rotational movement from the input to the output shaft. A stationary housing extends around the input and output shaft and has a transducer shell secured thereto. When {{force is applied to}} the input shaft to cause movement, the balls encounter torsional resistance which causes the balls to roll up the ramps of the conical seat inserts to separate the two torque flanges. The force transmitted through the balls causes rotation to the output shaft and produces tension to the <b>stationary</b> transducer <b>shell.</b> The <b>stationary</b> transducer <b>shell</b> is instrumented with semi-conductor strain gauges...|$|R
40|$|Cylindrical spacetimes with {{rotation}} are studied {{using the}} Newmann-Penrose formulas. By studying null geodesic deviations the physical meaning of each {{component of the}} Riemann tensor is given. These spacetimes are further extended to include rotating dynamic shells, and the general expression of the surface energy-momentum tensor of the shells is given {{in terms of the}} discontinuation of the first derivatives of the metric coefficients. As an application of the developed formulas, a <b>stationary</b> <b>shell</b> that generates the Lewis solutions, which represent the most general vacuum cylindrical solutions of the Einstein field equations with rotation, is studied by assuming that the spacetime inside the shell is flat. It is shown that the shell can satisfy all the energy conditions by properly choosing the parameters appearing in the model, provided that 0 <σ< 1, where σ is related to the mass per unit length of the shell.

40|$|High flux {{and high}} CRI may be {{achieved}} by combining different chips and/or phosphors. This, however, results in inhomogeneous sources that, when combined with collimating optics, typically produce patterns with undesired artifacts. These may {{be a combination of}} spatial, angular or color non-uniformities. In order to avoid these effects, {{there is a need to}} mix the light source, both spatially and angularly. Diffusers can achieve this effect, but they also increase the etendue (and reduce the brightness) of the resulting source, leading to optical systems of increased size and wider emission angles. The <b>shell</b> <b>mixer</b> is an optic comprised of many lenses on a shell covering the source. These lenses perform Kohler integration to mix the emitted light, both spatially and angularly. Placing it on top of a multi-chip Lambertian light source, the result is a highly homogeneous virtual source (i. e, spatially and angularly mixed), also Lambertian, which is located in the same position with essentially the same size (so the average brightness is not increased). This virtual light source can then be collimated using another optic, resulting in a homogeneous pattern without color separation. Experimental measurements have shown optical efficiency of the shell of 94 %, and highly homogeneous angular intensity distribution of collimated beams, in good agreement with the ray-tracing simulations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{present an}} {{improved}} {{study of the}} expected shape of the line-of-sight velocity distribution in shell galaxies. We found a simple analytical expression con-necting prominent and in principle observable {{characteristics of the line}} profile and mass-distribution of the galaxy. The prediction was compared with the results from a test-particle simulation of a radial merger. Quadruple-peaked Spectral-line Profile Stellar shells are observed in almost half of elliptical and S 0 galaxies that live in a low galactic density environment, see e. g. [1]. They are thought to be by-products of galaxy mergers [5]. The most regular shell systems are believed to result from a nearly minor radial merger in which the satellite galaxy is dissolved by tidal forces and its stars begin to oscillate in the potential of the host galaxy at close-to-radial orbits. The stars accumulate at their turning points and create shells. The shape of line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD) {{in the vicinity of the}} shell edge for a <b>stationary</b> <b>shell</b> was studied by [4]. They predicted a double-peaked spectral-line profile and proposed to use spectroscopy to probe the dark matter dis...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} free {{vibrations}} of rotating cylindrical shells with both ends free are studied. The model used {{also allows for}} considering a flexible foundation supporting the shell {{in the sense of}} a radial and circumferential distributed stiffness. Furthermore, a circumferential tension (hoop stress) which may be due to pressurisation or centrifugal forces is taken into account. Natural frequencies and mode shapes are determined exactly for both <b>stationary</b> <b>shells</b> and for shells rotating with a constant angular speed around the cylinder axis. Trigonometric functions are assumed for the circumferential mode shape profiles, and a sum of eight weighted exponential functions is assumed for the axial mode shape profiles. The functional form of the axial profiles is shown to greatly vary with the roots of a characteristic bi-quartic polynomial that occurs in the process of satisfying the equations of motion. In the previously published work it has been very often assumed that the roots are two real, two imaginary, and two pairs of complex conjugates. In the present study, a total of eight types of roots are shown to determine the whole set of mode shapes, either for stationary or for rotating shells. The results using the developed analytical model are compared with results of experimental studies and very good agreement is obtained. Also, a parametric study is carried out where effects of the elastic foundation stiffnesses and the rotation speed are examined. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Stellar shells {{observed}} in many giant elliptical and lenticular {{as well as}} a few spiral and dwarf galaxies, presumably result from galaxy mergers. Line-of-sight velocity distributions of the shells could, in principle, if measured with a sufficiently high S/N, constitute one of methods to constrain the gravitational potential of the host galaxy. Merrifield & Kuijken (1998) predicted a double-peaked line profile for <b>stationary</b> <b>shells</b> resulting from a nearly radial minor merger. In this paper, we aim at extending their analysis to a more realistic case of expanding shells, inherent to the merging process, whereas we assume the same type of merger and the same orbital geometry. We use analytical approach as well as test particle simulations to predict the line-of-sight velocity profile across the shell structure. Simulated line profiles are convolved with spectral PSFs to estimate the peak detectability. The resulting line-of-sight velocity distributions are more complex than previously predicted due to non-zero phase velocity of the shells. In principle, each of the Merrifield & Kuijken (1998) peaks splits into two, giving a quadruple-peaked line profile, which allows more precise determination of the potential of the host galaxy and, moreover, contains additional information. We find simple analytical expressions that connect the positions of the four peaks of the line profile and the mass distribution of the galaxy, namely the circular velocity at the given shell radius and the propagation velocity of the shell. The analytical expressions were applied to a test-particle simulation of a radial minor merger and the potential of the simulated host galaxy was successfully recovered. The shell kinematics can thus become an independent tool to determine the content and distribution of the dark matter in shell galaxies, up to ~ 100 kpc {{from the center of the}} host galaxy.

40|$|OAO- 2 {{spectral}} {{scans of}} several early-type main-sequence {{stars and the}} shell star zeta Tau are analyzed to derive a representative UV spectrum for B-type supergiants. The absorption lines in the spectra of the B-type supergiants are shown to be stronger than those in main-sequence stars {{and to have a}} broad pointed feature at 1720 A that is constant in all such stars. The UV resonance lines of C IV, N V, Si III, and Si IV are found to be displaced toward the shorter wavelengths by velocities of up to 1800 km/s, indicating an escaping atmosphere. For B 5 stars, the atmosphere is estimated to be expanding at about 120 km/s.

40|$|Tokamak plasma {{performance}} can, in theory, {{be greatly}} improved if {{the so called}} resistive wall mode is stabilized. This {{can be achieved by}} spinning the plasma rapidly, but such a scheme is not reactor relevant. A more promising approach is to apply external feedback {{in order to make a}} resistive shell placed around the plasma act like a perfect conductor. A scheme is outlined by which a network of feedback controlled conductors surrounding the plasma can be made to act like a rotating shell. This fake rotating shell combined with a <b>stationary</b> conventional <b>shell</b> (e. g. the vacuum vessel) can completely stabilize the resistive wall mode. The gain, bandwidth, current, and power requirements of the feedback amplifiers are extremely modest.

40|$|The {{presence}} of narrow, shifted absorption features superposed {{on the wide}} P Cygni profiles of the UV resonance lines in the spectra of O and B stars is studied and possible explanations of the narrow components are discussed. Spectra from 26 stars of spectral types O 4 f to B 1 Ib were examined for the {{presence of}} narrow components in the absorption part of the profiles, and positive evidence was detected in 17. The central velocities of the features are found to be similar for different ions of the same star, and typically equal to 0. 75 times the terminal velocity of the stellar wind. The width of the narrow absorptions is about 18 % of the terminal stellar wind velocity, with a column density generally not correlated with the effective temperature or mass loss rate. Possible explanations for the narrow components include peaks in the degree of ionization, a <b>stationary</b> stellar <b>shell,</b> a plateau in the stellar wind velocity law, a decelerating stellar wind, a variable mass loss rate or a two component stellar wind with low-velocity, low-density material found at a distance greater than 2 stellar radii, which explanation appears most likely...|$|R
40|$|One {{strategy}} {{to reduce costs}} in manufacturing a biochemical product is simplification of downstream processing. Biochemical product recovery often starts from fermentation broth or cell culture. In conventional downstream processing, the initial steps are clarification, concentration, and purification. Simplification of downstream processing may be achieved by {{reducing the number of}} unit operations. Integrative technologies seek to combine steps into a new single unit operation, thereby tightening the whole process. Vortex flow occurs in the annular gap between an inner rotating solid cylinder and an outer <b>stationary</b> cylindrical <b>shell.</b> Above a critical rotation rate, circular Couette flow bifurcates to a series of counter-rotating toroidal vortices. By suspending adsorbent resin in the vortices, a novel unit operation, vortex flow adsorption (VFA), is created. In VFA, the rotation of the inner cylinder facilitates the fluidization of the adsorbent resin. In addition, VFA has high fluid voidage {{so that it can be}} used to recover biochemical products directly from fermentation broths or cell homogenates without removing cells or cell debris first. VFA was characterized through two experimental approaches, tracer residence time distribution (RTD) study and breakthrough capacity measurements, and two modeling approaches, a one-dimensional dispersion convective model and a two-region vortex flow model. It was concluded that the axial dispersion in the vortex flow system is distinct in different vortex flow regimes. (cont.) The effect of the operating variables, including the rotation rate of the inner cylinder, the axial loading flowrate, and the adsorbent volume fraction, on the performance of VFA was explored. In this research, recombinant human (cl-antitrypsin ([alpha]l-AT) was expressed in Escherichia coli as a C-terminal fusion to a modified intein containing a chitin-binding domain. The VFA results indicated that VFA not only captures the fusion protein from crude cell extract containing cell debris but also purifies ocl-AT. Therefore, vortex flow adsorption is an integrative technology to combine the primary clarification, concentration, and purification steps to simplify conventional downstream processing. by Junfen Ma.

40|$|In this thesis, we {{model the}} circumstellar medium of stars with initial masses of 8, 12, 18 and 20 solar masses, over their entire {{life from the}} main {{sequence}} until their supernova explosion. During the post-main-sequence stages, stars can evolve through several blue and red supergiant stages depending on their initial mass, composition and rotation rate. The models considered in the second Chapter have long-lasting RSG stages starting after the MS. In this phase, they develop shells of RSG wind material at the location where the free streaming RSG wind is stalled by the thermal pressure of the hot MS bubble, close to the central star. The RSG shells develop violent Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. Once these start to grow non-linear, the RSG shell becomes highly structured as clumps form, and shell material mixes with material in the hot bubble. Later, the stars evolve to the BSG stage, during which the RSG shells are completely destroyed. These models return to the RSG stage, and build new RSG shells, which are more massive than those formed earlier. RSG shells are essential for our understanding of bipolar emission nebulae around BSGs. In the third Chapter are shown {{the results of the}} wind-wind interaction model of single star with 12 solar masses. On a time scale of a few 10000 yr, a BSG hour-glas shaped nebula expands into the sphere defined by the RSG shell. The faster polar parts of the hour glass hit the inner edge of the RSG shell first. The collision creates a pair of hot and dense polar caps. As time passes, the collision zone moves to lower latitudes of the RSG shell and becomes more confined in latitude. At the same time, the interaction of the BSG wind with the equatorial disk defines a second, ring shaped collision zone in the equatorial plane. These structures are reminiscent of the observed nebulae around the blue supergiant Sher 25. In the Chapter 3 we present calculations that predict the properties of the circumstellar medium for rapidly rotating and slowly rotating blue supergiants. In their post-main-sequence phases, the stars with 10 and 12 solar masses undergo a blue-loop following a first red supergiant stage. Before they explode as supernovae, the stars go back for a second time to the red supergiant stage. In case of a rapidly rotating central star, the collision of an hour-glass shaped <b>shell</b> with a <b>stationary</b> red supergiant <b>shell</b> forms a highly structured rotationally symmetric nebula. In contrast: if the star rotates slowly, a spherical nebula may form. The last Chapter shows preliminary results of possible ways for the formation of the outer rings observed around SN 1987 A nebula through wind-wind interaction. At the end of the main sequence stage, our star model goes through a first blue supergiant post-main sequence stage becoming later a red supergiant. Before exploding as a supernova, the progenitor enters a second blue supergiant phase. During this phase the star reaches critical rotation. Due to the non-spherical wind of the first BSG phase, a shell of wind material is broken into two parts, with a high density ring-shaped intersection at mid-latitudes, which has some similarity to the outer circumstellar rings of SN 1987 A...|$|R
