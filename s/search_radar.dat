5|$|Several radars {{were added}} during the war. A Type 285 gunnery radar was mounted {{on top of}} the HACS {{director}} and a Type 271/73 surface <b>search</b> <b>radar</b> was installed abaft the two-pounder guns on the forecastle.|$|E
5|$|During their {{modernization}} {{under the}} 600-ship Navy program, the Iowa-class battleships' radar systems were again upgraded. The AN/SPS-6 air-search radar system {{was replaced with}} the AN/SPS-49 radar set (which also augmented the existing navigation capabilities on the battleships), and the AN/SPS-8 surface-search radar set {{was replaced by the}} AN/SPS-67 <b>search</b> <b>radar.</b>|$|E

5|$|Most ships {{had their}} director-control tower and {{rangefinder}} above the bridge removed {{in exchange for}} a Type 271 target-indication radar. A Type 286 short-range surface <b>search</b> <b>radar,</b> adapted from the Royal Air Force's ASV radar, was also added. The early models, however, could only scan directly forward and had to be aimed by turning the entire ship. Some ships also received a Huff-Duff radio direction finder on a short mainmast.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary radar}} sensor {{of the class}} is the EL/M-2248 MF-STAR {{multi-mission}} AESA. It is also equipped with Thales LW-08 long range volume <b>search</b> <b>radar</b> and EL/M-2238 S-band STAR surveillance radar from Israel Aerospace Industries. A Nagin active towed array sonar and a bow-mounted sonar HUMSA-NG (hull-mounted sonar array - new generation) are carried for sub-surface surveillance. To protect against anti-ship missiles coming from multiple directions, the ship carries the Elbit Systems Deseaver MK-II decoy control and launching system.|$|E

50|$|Weather <b>radars</b> can {{resemble}} <b>search</b> <b>radars.</b> This radar uses {{radio waves}} along with horizontal, dual (horizontal and vertical), or circular polarization. The frequency selection of weather radar is a performance compromise between precipitation reflectivity and attenuation due to atmospheric water vapor. Some weather radars uses doppler shift to measure wind speeds and dual-polarization for identification {{of types of}} precipitations.|$|R
500|$|Two Type 94 high-angle fire-control {{director}}s, one on {{each side}} of the ship, were fitted to control the Type 89 guns. Each director mounted a [...] rangefinder. Six Type 95 directors controlled the 25mm guns and the rocket launchers. Early warning was provided by two Type 2, Mark 2, Model 1 air <b>search</b> <b>radars.</b> One of these was mounted on the top of the island while the other retracted into the port side of the flight deck, between the two elevators. In addition, Amagi had two smaller Type 3, Mark 1, Model 3 air <b>search</b> <b>radars,</b> one mounted on the tripod mast on the island and the other on the aft starboard retractable radio mast.|$|R
5|$|The ship's {{original}} armament {{consisted of}} a single Bofors 40 mm D70 gun mounted on the ship's bow, a quadruple Strela 2 launcher behind the bridge and a quad 20mm M-75 gun on the stern. Eight MDB-MT3 depth charges could be carried for anti-submarine warfare duties. Located on the sides were two double-barrel 128mm illumination launchers. Sensors included a Racal Decca RM 1216 A surface <b>search</b> <b>radar</b> and a Simrad SQ 3D/SF sonar.|$|E
5|$|A Type 271 surface <b>search</b> <b>radar</b> {{replaced}} the fire-control director and rangefinder above the bridge. A Type 290 surface warning radar was added {{at the top}} of the foremast. A High frequency direction finding system was added on a pole mast aft. The ship also received a Type 242 IFF system. Two 4.7-inch guns were removed, one each forward and aft, and the forward gun was replaced by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar. The 3-inch anti-aircraft gun amidships was also removed, but the number of 20mm AA guns was increased to six.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of war, the ship was fitted with a degaussing coil to protect her against magnetic mines. In 1942, the ship's aircraft handling equipment and aft torpedo tubes were removed. Throughout the war, her radar suite was upgraded; in March 1941, she was equipped with FuMO 21 radar and in early 1942, a FuMO 25 radar set was installed. The latter was a <b>search</b> <b>radar</b> for surface targets and low-flying aircraft at low range. The FuMO 21 set {{was replaced by the}} short-range FuMO 63 Hohentwiel 50-centimeter radar. Nürnberg was also fitted with four Metox radar warning receivers.|$|E
50|$|The {{modernisation}} of {{the currently}} used ships {{is also going}} on. Two navigational radars with helicopter landing control facilities are being procured for BNS Dhaleshwari and BNS Bijoy. Contract has been signed for the supply of two air <b>search</b> <b>radars</b> for BNS Abu Bakar and BNS Ali Haider.|$|R
5|$|An August 1944 study {{anticipated}} that the ships would carry four early warning radars, including height-finders, four surface <b>search</b> <b>radars</b> and eight gunnery/fire-control radars. Historian David Hobbs wrote that they would mount Type 960 early warning, Type 982 intercept, Type 983 height-finding and Type 293M target indication radars. In addition a number of gunnery radars would also be needed.|$|R
2500|$|The {{amplitude}} of random noise is not {{changed by the}} compression process, so the signal to noise ratios of received chirp signals are increased in the process. [...] In {{the case of a}} high power <b>search</b> <b>radars,</b> this extends the range performance of the system, while for stealth systems the property will permit lower transmitter powers to be used.|$|R
5|$|Early warning {{would have}} been {{provided}} by a Type 2, Mark 2, Model 1 air <b>search</b> <b>radar</b> mounted {{at the top of}} the foremast. A Type 93 passive hydrophone system {{would have been}} fitted in the bow. The ships were designed to carry three aircraft on a platform between the funnel and the mainmast. These would have consisted of one three-seat Aichi E13A and two two-seat Yokosuka E14Y floatplanes. They would have been launched by a pair of aircraft catapults, one on each side of the aircraft platform.|$|E
5|$|The main sonar array is a Thomson Sintra Scylla active/passive bow sonar, {{linked to}} a passive {{intercept}} and ranging array distributed along the flanks of the submarine; three panels on each side. Collins and Farncomb were originally fitted with Thales Karriwarra passive towed sonar arrays, while the other four boats could be fitted with the Karriwarra or Thales' Namara array. These were later replaced across the class with the Thales SHOR-TAS towed passive array, deployed through the horizontal 'pipe' at the stern. When surfaced or at periscope depth, the Collins-class boats can use a Kelvin Hughes Type 1007 surface <b>search</b> <b>radar,</b> which is situated in a retractable mast on the fin.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of war, both ships were fitted with a degaussing coil to protect them against magnetic mines. Leipzig had her aircraft equipment removed in 1941, along with her after torpedo tubes. In 1942, Nürnbergs aircraft handling equipment and aft torpedo tubes were also removed. Throughout the war, the ships' radar suites were upgraded; in March 1941, Nürnberg was equipped with FuMO 21 radar and in early 1942, a FuMO 25 radar set was installed. The latter was a <b>search</b> <b>radar</b> for surface targets and low-flying aircraft at low range. The FuMO 21 set {{was replaced by the}} short-range FuMO 63 Hohentwiel 50-centimeter radar. Nürnberg was also fitted with four Metox radar warning receivers. Leipzig did not receive her FuMO 24/25 radar set until 1943; this was to be the last modification for Leipzig.|$|E

They are often operated alongside Egypt's fleet of Westland Sea Kings.|$|R
5|$|Both ships {{underwent}} extensive refits {{near the}} end or after the war. North Carolina received a secondary air search set (SR) and a SCR-720 zenith <b>search</b> <b>radar</b> on the forward funnel. At {{the end of the}} war, it had an SP surface-search, a SK-2 air-search, a Mark 38 main battery fire control system with Mark 13 and 27 radars, a Mark 37 secondary battery fire control system with Mark 12, 22 and 32 radars, and a Mark 57 smaller weaponry fire control system, with a Mark 34 radar. In March 1946, Washington had a SK fore and a SR aft, a SG both fore and aft, and a TDY jammer (which could scramble radar on other ships).|$|E
5|$|By November 1942, North Carolina had an {{additional}} Mark 4 and a SG surface <b>search</b> <b>radar</b> added. The normal battleship configuration was present aboard North Carolina in April 1944, with SK and SG radars (air and surface search, respectively), a backup SG, and Mark 8s to direct its main battery. All of the Mark 4s remained for the secondary battery, {{and one of}} the older Mark 3s was still present, possibly as a backup for the Mark 8s. An SK-2 dish replaced the older SK radar and Mark 12s and 22s superseded the Mark 4s in September of that year. Aside from never receiving an SK-2, Washington was the recipient of similar upgrades.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Sea Kings {{had similar}} {{avionics}} {{to that of}} the Sea King HAS.1, with the same ARI 5995 <b>search</b> <b>radar</b> in a dorsal radome, but had American Bendix AN/ASQ-13A dipping sonar instead of the Plessey sonar of the Royal Navy Sea Kings. They also had more powerful engines giving improved high temperature hover performance. Australia's Sea Kings were flown by 817 Squadron RAN from HMAS Melbourne until the carrier was retired from service, without replacement. As the Sea King was too large to operate from the s, 817 Squadron was then forced to operate from land bases, in both ASW and utility roles, with the Sea King relinquishing the anti-submarine mission in 1990.|$|E
