50|$|Sickles was {{assigned}} to the action/adventure comic <b>Scorchy</b> Smith, whose creator, John Terry, was suffering from tuberculosis. Loosely modeled on Charles Lindbergh, <b>Scorchy</b> was a pilot-for-hire who flew into numerous high-octane globe-trotting adventures. The series, which started in 1930, was heavily influenced by Roy Crane’s adventure strip Wash Tubbs. Sickles initially illustrated the strip as a ghost artist, but he signed his own name after Terry's 1934 death.|$|E

50|$|Charles Lindbergh's 1927 transatlantic flight {{increased}} interest in aviation, and together with several other flight-related adventure strips, <b>Scorchy</b> Smith debuted in 1930, created by John Terry for AP Newsfeatures. When Terry developed fatal tuberculosis in 1933, the strip was assigned to Noel Sickles. Sickles increased the popularity of <b>Scorchy</b> Smith, which became AP's leading strip, creating a new school of cartooning in the process. Sickles' impressionistic style and cinematic compositions, plus his frequent use of areas of pure black ink and Zipatone shading, was dramatically {{different from any other}} cartoonist at the time. Milton Caniff's mastery of the medium is frequently attributed to his collaborations with Sickles.|$|E

50|$|In {{the wake}} of Charles Lindbergh's 1927 flight across the Atlantic, the public's fascination with {{aviation}} escalated. Tailspin Tommy was the first aviation-based comic strip to appear {{as a result of}} this heightened interest. The strip's 1928 launch was followed by others, notably Skyroads, <b>Scorchy</b> Smith, and Flyin' Jenny and The Adventures of Smilin' Jack.|$|E

50|$|In fall 1936, Sickles {{researched}} <b>Scorchy</b> Smith’s circulation, {{information that}} AP Newsfeatures never shared with their artists. Estimating that the strip was running in 250 papers across the country, Sickles {{determined that the}} syndicate's monthly take approximated $2,500 a month, of which he, as both scripter and artist, received only $125. Sickles asked for a raise, and when his request was refused, he quit cartooning to become a magazine illustrator.|$|E

He wrote for the {{syndicated}} newspaper strip <b>Scorchy</b> Smith, and wrote comics stories for the packagers Eisner & Iger (sometimes using the names Bob Farrow and Bob Lerraf.) Farrell wrote many comics throughout the 1940s, though usually without attribution, as most stories produced during the period didn't contain credits.|$|E

50|$|In 1939, the Associated Press hired Robbins to {{take over}} the {{aviation}} strip <b>Scorchy</b> Smith which he drew until 1944. Robbins created his Johnny Hazard strip in 1944 and worked on it {{for more than three decades}} until it ended in 1977. Robbins' Johnny Hazard comic book was published by Standard Comics from August 1948 to May 1949. The Sunday strips were reprinted in a full-color volume published by the Pacific Comics Club. Other reprints were published by Pioneer Comics and Dragon Lady Press.|$|E
50|$|After Christman left <b>Scorchy</b> Smith, a {{succession}} of artists handled the strip, including Robert Farrell and Frank Robbins, who began signing the strip on May 22, 1939. Robbins, who {{had never had a}} feature of his own before, soon developed a solid reputation for creating comic-strip adventure. A wartime sequence set in Russia drew the following comment."...formidable reality: it creates the sense of deep snows, it is full of bitter, bloody struggle". In 1944, he was hired by King Features Syndicate, where he created Johnny Hazard, another pilot-adventurer.|$|E
5000|$|Simultaneously at first, from 1954 to 1959, Tuska {{took over}} as writer-artist for the failing {{adventure}} comic strip <b>Scorchy</b> Smith, supplying [...] "eye-catching drawings and interesting plots, {{but it was too}} late". The strip would end in 1961. Tuska by then had moved on to the long-running science-fiction comic strip Buck Rogers, on which he was the final artist, drawing both the daily and Sunday strip from April 1959 to 1965, and the daily only from then through 1967, when both the daily and the Sunday were canceled.|$|E
50|$|After work in advertising, Robbins {{took over}} the daily strip <b>Scorchy</b> Smith from Noel Sickles in 1939 with a Sunday page added in 1940. King Features then asked Robbins to do Secret Agent X-9, but Robbins instead chose to devise an {{aviation}} comic for the syndicate, and Johnny Hazard was launched on Monday, June 5, 1944, one day before D-Day. While working on the strip during the 1940s, Robbins contributed illustrations to Life, Look, The Saturday Evening Post and other magazines. Robbins stopped drawing Johnny Hazard in 1977 and retired to Mexico in order to devote himself to painting full-time.|$|E
50|$|In the 1970s, Gelman did two {{collections}} of <b>Scorchy</b> Smith, {{and he moved}} into yet another area, publishing a magazine, Nostalgia, mainly devoted to reprints of comic strips. The first issue of his earlier magazine, Nostalgia Illustrated, was completed in 1967 as a dummy but was never published. Instead, Gelman sold the title and some material to Magazine Management, which did {{at least a dozen}} nationally distributed issues in the early 1970s. During the 1970s, he also published his Golden Age of the Comics series, reprinting such strips as Mandrake the Magician, Terry and the Pirates and Thimble Theatre.|$|E
5000|$|In 1944, Schwartz {{enlisted in}} the Navy, and he was trained at Jacksonville as a radar {{operator}} and gunner. After two years service, Schwartz left the Navy and worked for Rod Willard on <b>Scorchy</b> Smith. In 1946, as well as becoming {{a founding member of}} the National Cartoonists Society, Schwartz met Bob Kane on a beach in Miami. Kane hired him to work on a baseball strip called Dusty Diamond which Kane stated he was developing with Will Eisner. Although Eisner had no memory of this strip in later years, Eddie Campbell has identified it as being for publication in Tab - [...] The Comic Weekly. The strip never saw print, as Tab was cancelled after one issue.|$|E

50|$|Haley {{was born}} in Seattle, Washington to a large Catholic family, the fifth of six children. His father was an airline {{executive}} {{and his mother was}} a homemaker and part-time maid. His father is of Irish and Italian descent, which is where he gets his Italian middle name Carlo. At the age of three his family moved to Saint-Jovite, Quebec and he was put in a boarding home where he learned to speak fluent French. He disliked the experience so much that upon his return to Seattle 18 months later, he refused to speak the language except to translate for his younger sister, who only spoke French. He began acting as a child in the Seattle area doing community and school theater. As a teenager, he stumbled upon the film set of <b>Scorchy</b> (1976) in downtown Seattle. After seeing some of the movie being filmed, jumping into a few shots as an extra and meeting the star, Connie Stevens, he decided to pursue a career in show business.|$|E
