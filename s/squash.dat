5|$|Cucurbita {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, {{including}} the Cabbage Moth (Mamestra brassicae), Hypercompe indecisa, and the Turnip Moth (Agrotis segetum). Cucurbita can be susceptible to the pest Bemisia argentifolii (silverleaf whitefly) as well as aphids (Aphididae), cucumber beetles (Acalymma vittatum and Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi), <b>squash</b> bug (Anasa tristis), the <b>squash</b> vine borer (Melittia cucurbitae), and the twospotted spidermite (Tetranychus urticae). The <b>squash</b> bug causes major damage to plants because of its very toxic saliva.|$|E
5|$|David played <b>squash</b> {{when she}} was five years old, and {{received}} coaching {{at the age of}} eight. While training at the Bukit Dumbar <b>Squash</b> Centre, David was talent spotted by Ee Phoeh Hoon, who led her to represent her home state of Penang, along with her sisters. David's <b>squash</b> career began in 1992 when she won silver in the Under-14 category of the Penang State Junior Championship. Her first national level victory was also in 1992 at the Milo-Dunlop Sport National Junior Interstate Championship, where she won silver in the Under-16 category. In 1994, David was chosen to join the Penang state <b>squash</b> team for the Malaysian Games (SUKMA) tournament where she helped Penang win a gold medal in the team event, despite being ill at the time. In the same year, she won her first two international titles – the Hong Kong U-13 and the Scottish Junior Open Under-12.|$|E

40|$|The {{stability}} of <b>squashed</b> Kaluza-Klein black holes is studied. The <b>squashed</b> Kaluza-Klein black hole looks like five dimensional {{black hole in}} the vicinity of horizon and four dimensional Minkowski spacetime with a circle at infinity. In this sense, <b>squashed</b> Kaluza-Klein black holes can be regarded as black holes in the Kaluza-Klein spacetimes. Using the symmetry of <b>squashed</b> Kaluza-Klein black holes, SU(2) × U(1) ≃ U(2), we obtain master equations for a part of the metric perturbations relevant to the stability. The analysis based on the master equations gives a strong evidence for the {{stability of}} <b>squashed</b> Kaluza-Klein black holes. Hence, the <b>squashed</b> Kaluza-Klein black holes deserve to be taken seriously as realistic black holes in the Kaluza-Klein spacetime.

With the expectation that the Hawking radiation reflects the 5 -dimensional nature of the <b>squashed</b> horizon, we study the Hawking radiation of a scalar field in the <b>squashed</b> black hole background.

40|$|The <b>squashed</b> Kaluza-Klien (KK) {{black holes}} {{differ from the}} Schwarzschild black holes with {{asymptotic}} flatness or the black strings even at energies for which the KK modes are not excited yet, so that <b>squashed</b> KK black holes open a window in higher dimensions. Another important feature is that the <b>squashed</b> KK black holes are apparently stable and, thereby, let us avoid the Gregory-Laflamme instability. In the present paper, the evolution of scalar and gravitational perturbations in time and frequency domains is considered for these <b>squashed</b> KK black holes. The scalar field perturbations are analyzed for general rotating <b>squashed</b> KK black holes. Gravitational perturbations for the so called zero mode are shown to be decayed for non-rotating black holes, in concordance with {{the stability of the}} <b>squashed</b> KK black holes. The correlation of quasinormal frequencies with the size of extra dimension is discussed. Comment: 12 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the strong gravitational lensing in a rotating <b>squashed</b> Kaluza-Klein (KK) black hole spacetime. Our result show that the strong gravitational lensings in the rotating <b>squashed</b> KK black hole spacetime have some distinct behaviors {{from those in the}} backgrounds of the four-dimensional Kerr black hole and of the <b>squashed</b> KK Gödel black hole. In the rotating <b>squashed</b> KK black hole spacetime, the marginally circular photon radius ρ ps, the coefficient a, b, the deflection angle α (θ) in the ϕ direction and the corresponding observational variables are independent of whether the photon goes with or against the rotation of the background, which is different with those in the usual four-dimensional Kerr black hole spacetime. Moreover, we also find that with the increase of the scale of extra dimension ρ 0, the marginally circular photon radius ρ ps and the angular position of the relativistic images θ ∞ first decreases and then increases in the rotating <b>squashed</b> KK black hole for fixed rotation parameter b, but in the <b>squashed</b> KK Gödel black hole they increase for the smaller global rotation parameter j and decrease for the larger one. In the extremely <b>squashed</b> case ρ 0 = 0, the coefficient a in the rotating <b>squashed</b> KK black hole increases monotonously with the rotation parameter, but in the <b>squashed</b> KK Gödel black hole it is a constant and independent of the global rotation of the Gödel Universe. These information could help us to understand further the effects of the rotation parameter and the scale of extra dimension on the strong gravitational lensing in the black hole spacetimes...|$|R

40|$|The {{electronic}} {{properties of}} <b>squashed</b> arm-chair carbon nanotubes are modeled using constraint free density functional tight binding molecular dynamics simulations. Independent from CNT diameter, <b>squashing</b> path {{can be divided}} into three regimes. In the first regime, the nanotube deforms with negligible force. In the second one, there is significantly more resistance to <b>squashing</b> with the force being ∼ 40 - 100 nN/per CNT unit cell. In the last regime, the CNT looses its hexagonal structure resulting in force drop-off followed by substantial force enhancement upon <b>squashing.</b> We compute the change in band-gap as a function of <b>squashing</b> and our main results are: (i) A band-gap initially opens due to interaction between atoms at the top and bottom sides of CNT. The π-orbital approximation is successful in modeling the band-gap opening at this stage. (ii) In the second regime of <b>squashing,</b> large π-σ interaction at the edges becomes important, which can lead to band-gap oscillation. (iii) Contrary to a common perception, nanotubes with broken mirror symmetry can have zero band-gap. (iv) All armchair nanotubes become metallic in the third regime of <b>squashing.</b> Finally, we discuss both differences and similarities obtained from the tight binding and density functional approaches.

50|$|<b>Squashing</b> {{functions}} are functions {{used to reduce}} the size of domain of constraint languages. A <b>squashing</b> function is defined in terms of a partition of the domain and a representative element for each set in the partition. The <b>squashing</b> function maps all elements of a set in the partition to the representative element of that set. For such a function being a <b>squashing</b> function it is also necessary that applying the function to all elements of a tuple of a relation in the language produces another tuple in the relation. The partition is assumed to contain at least a set of size greater than one.|$|R
50|$|For {{constraint}} {{problems on}} a constraint language has a <b>squashing</b> function, the domain {{can be reduced}} via the <b>squashing</b> function. Indeed, every element in a set in the partition can be replaced with the result of applying the <b>squashing</b> function to it, as this result is guaranteed to satisfy at least all constraints that were satisfied by the element. As a result, all non-representative elements can {{be removed from the}} constraint language.|$|R

One of the major drawbacks of SVMs is the necessity to solve a large-scale quadratic programming problem.

We reduce the problem of training the SVMs on the weighted "squashed" data to a quadratic programming problem that can be solved using Platt's sequential minimal optimization (SMO) algorithm.
