The non-combative cause is its conjunction with soul possessing adrishta (or results of actions in previous states of existence) and the combinative cause is the jewel. Adrishta is also the cause of attraction of the needle towards a loadstone (magnet). Owing to adrishta is the upwards flaming of fire, the <b>sideward</b> <b>motion</b> of air and the actions of atoms at the beginning of creation. Kanada later on tells us that even action in earth results from impulse, impact and conjunction with the conjunct and is caused by Adrishta (Vaisheshika Sutra V.ii.1-2).The fruits or rewards of yajnas or sacrifice are not dispensed by any beneficent God. Apurva bestows the reward on the sacrificer. Apurva is the essential link between work and its result; it is a positive and unseen force created by an act that leads to the attainment of the fruit of action. This is the view of Jaimini though not implicitly mentioned by him but accepted by Prabhakara and Kumarila as one their fundamental tenets of their respective schools. Later on it came to be said that Apurva is the function of God. Kumarila insists that fruits of karmas accrue in this very life and not in some future life. Bhartrmitra, who lived long before Sabara who lived long before Kumarila, does not accept Apurva. However, Patanjali tells us - ...|$|E

In the process of the flare, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) loops displayed two times of <b>sideward</b> <b>motions</b> upon a loop-top hard X-ray source with average velocities of 75 and 25. 6 km s − 1, respectively. Meanwhile part of the loops disappeared and new post-flare loops formed. We consider these two motions to be the observational evidence of reconnection inflow, and find an X-shaped structure upon the post-flare loops during the period of the second motion. Two separations of the flare ribbons are associated with these two <b>sideward</b> <b>motions,</b> with average velocities of 3. 3 and 1. 3 km s − 1, separately. The <b>sideward</b> <b>motions</b> of the EUV loops and the separations of the flare ribbons are temporally consistent with two peaks of the X-ray flux. This indicates that there are two times of magnetic reconnection in the process of the flare. Using the observation of photospheric magnetic field, the velocities o...|$|R

A cloud of bright material flowing outward from the loop-top hard X-ray source with an average velocity of 51 km/s in the process of the flare may be accelerated by the tension force of the newly reconnected magnetic field lines.

40|$|Cinemicrographic studies {{revealed}} {{that the development of}} elongated subsurface colonies of Staphylococcus aureus in soft agar (< 0. 2 % agar) originated with a colony-forming unit of about 10 to 20 cells. It was then observed that small clusters of 3 to 12 cells broke off from the main colony unit and drifted away under the combined influence of gravity and Brownian motion. Once the downward or slightly <b>sideward</b> <b>motion</b> of the small clusters ceased, the clusters would continue to increase in size; at the same time, additional small clusters broke off, and the cycle was repeated until the entire colony was formed. Displacement and velocity measurements were made on the drifting small clusters. When compared with the dimensional growth rate and geometry of the subsurface colony, these showed that a correlation existed between the movement and velocity of the small clusters and the subsequent colony development. A relationship between the role of gravity reported in these results and the development of spherical colonies after rotation on a clinostat is suggested...|$|E

These bacteria arecharacterized by an outer sheath-like envelope, the toga,which includes the outer membrane and an amorphouslayer, and forms large periplasm at the poles of each rod. The cytoplasmic membrane and its contents are called‘‘cell’’, and the toga and its contents ‘‘rod’’, to distinguishbetween them. Optical cells were constructed to observebinary fission of T. globiformans. High-temperaturemicroscopy of rods adhering to optical cells’ coverslipsshowed that the large periplasm forms between newlydivided cells in a rod, followed by rod fission at the middleof the periplasm, which {{was accompanied by a}} sidewardmotion of the newly generated rod pole(s). Electronmicroscopic observations revealed that sessile rods grownon a glass plate have nanotubes adhered to the glass, andthese may be involved in the <b>sideward</b> <b>motion.</b> Epifluorescencemicroscopy with a membrane-staining dye suggestedthat formation of the septal outer membrane isdistinct from cytokinesis.

40|$|The optimal {{geometries}} {{and mechanical}} properties of a kink with P are studied by applying density functional theory to the [111](11 ̄ 0) edge dislocation in bcc iron. The calculated impurity segregation energy {{shows that the}} P atom can be potentially trapped by the kink, and the doping P preferably segregates to the core region of the [111](11 ̄ 0) edge dislocation {{rather than to the}} (010) edge dislocation. The analysis of the electronic structure indicates that the <b>sideward</b> <b>motion</b> of the kink is impeded owing to strong a interaction between P and neighboring Fe atoms. That is, the P induces a pinning effect on the [111](11 ̄ 0) edge dislocation. The hybridizations between P and Fe come from P 3 p and Fe 3 d 4 s 4 p. The p and d states have an obvious orientation, which may not be favorable to the toughness of iron.

40|$|AbstractMolecular motors {{translocate}} along cytoskeletal filaments, as in {{the case}} of kinesin motors on microtubules. Although conventional kinesin- 1 tracks a single microtubule protofilament, other kinesins, akin to dyneins, switch protofilaments. However, the molecular trajectory—whether protofilament switching occurs in a directed or stochastic manner—is unclear. Here, we used high-resolution optical tweezers to track the path of single budding yeast kinesin- 8, Kip 3, motor proteins. Under applied sideward loads, we found that individual motors stepped sideward in both directions, with and against loads, with a broad distribution in measured step sizes. Interestingly, the force response depended on the direction. Based on a statistical analysis and simulations accounting for the geometry, we propose a diffusive <b>sideward</b> stepping <b>motion</b> of Kip 3 on the microtubule lattice, asymmetrically biased by force. This finding is consistent with previous multimotor gliding assays and sheds light on the molecular switching mechanism. For kinesin- 8, the diffusive switching mechanism may enable the motor to bypass obstacles and reach the microtubule end for length regulation. For other motors, such a mechanism may have implications for torque generation around the filament axis...|$|R
40|$|Velocity {{correlations}} of intermediate mass fragments (IMFs), produced in collisions of Au+Au at 100, 150, 250, and 400 A. MeV beam energy, are extracted from measurements with the FOPI (phase I) detector system at SIS in GSI Darmstadt. The IMF correlation functions of peripheral and semi-central events {{are found to}} be strongly affected by the collective <b>sideward</b> <b>motion</b> of nuclear matter. The sideflow causes an enhancement of correlations at small relative velocities. This enhancement results from the mixing of differently azimuthally oriented events; it vanishes if the events are rotated into a unique reaction plane. Selecting violent central collisions, the comparison of the data with a Coulomb dominated final-state interaction model points to a radius of the expanding and multifragmenting source of R_s#approx =# 13 fm for 100 A. MeV which appears shrinking by 20 % when increasing the projectile neergy to 400 MeV per nucleon. The deduced source radii are found to depend on the radial explosion energy used in the model. The inclusion of such collective expansion is necessary for a reasonable description of the experimental single-particle spectra of the IMFs. The unique Coulomb suppression of small relative IMF velocities, found for the given beam energy range, is attributed to rather constant averaged next-neighbour distances left angle d_I_M_F right angle = 8. 6 #+-# 0. 2 fm of the IMF charge centers within the source at break-up time.

40|$|Background: Ankle ligamentous sprain {{is common}} in sports. The most direct way to study the {{mechanism}} quantitatively is to study real injury cases; however, it is unethical and impractical to produce an injury in the laboratory. A recently developed, model-based image-matching motion analysis technique allows quantitative analysis of real injury incidents captured in televised events and gives important knowledge {{for the development of}} injury prevention protocols and equipment. To date, there have been only 4 reported cases, and {{there is a need to}} conduct more studies for a better understanding of the mechanism of ankle ligamentous sprain injury. Purpose: This study presents 5 cases in tennis and a comparison with 4 previous cases for a better understanding of the mechanism of ankle ligamentous sprain injury. Study Design: Case series; level of evidence, 4. Methods: Five sets of videos showing ankle sprain injuries in televised tennis competition with 2 camera views were collected. The videos were transformed, synchronized, and rendered to a 3 -dimensional animation software. The dimensions of the tennis court in each case were obtained to build a virtual environment, and a skeleton model scaled to the injured athletes height was used for the skeleton matching. Foot strike was determined visually, and the profiles of the ankle joint kinematics were individually presented. Results: There was a pattern of sudden inversion and internal rotation at the ankle joint, with the peak values ranging from 48 °- 126 ° and 35 °- 99 °, respectively. In the sagittal plane, the ankle joint fluctuated between plantar flexion and dorsiflexion within the first 0. 50 seconds after foot strike. The peak inversion velocity ranged from 509 to 1488 deg/sec. Conclusion: Internal rotation at the ankle joint could be one of the causes of ankle inversion sprain injury, with a slightly inverted ankle joint orientation at landing as the inciting event. To prevent the foot from rolling over the edge to cause a sprain injury, tennis players who do lots of <b>sideward</b> cutting <b>motions</b> should try to land with a neutral ankle orientation and keep the center of pressure from shifting laterally...|$|R
