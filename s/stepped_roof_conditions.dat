40|$|Crinum Mine {{is located}} in the Bowen Basin and is {{operated}} by BM Alliance Pty Ltd. Longwall extraction commenced in 1997 in the 3. 4 m thick Lilyvale Seam and seven panels have been mined to date in the current block. The roof strata are variable and include some of the weakest longwall mining conditions in Australia. The immediate roof is predominantly a 15 to 25 MPa thinly bedded sandstone but includes weaker siltstone layers, typically 1 m to 2 m thick, with an average strength of 10 MPa. In some parts of the mining area the whole of the immediate roof appears to change laterally to a laminated siltstone with a strength as low as 2. 5 MPa. As the presence of these weaker horizons can influence the effectiveness of the primary and secondary support, as well as the roof stability on the longwall face, delineation of <b>roof</b> <b>conditions</b> forms {{a significant part of the}} strata management process. Strata are interpreted into geomechanical units from the sonic velocity logs to enable zones of similar conditions to be identified. More detailed interpretations are made along section lines for maingate development and panel hazard plans. Roof support and longwall management strategies are based on the delineated <b>roof</b> <b>conditions.</b> <b>Roof</b> performance is monitored by means of dual height telltales, mechanical, and three and four point electronic telltales, GEL extensometers.

40|$|<b>Roof</b> <b>conditions</b> in {{coal mines}} of the {{southern}} Sydney Basin, Australia, are typically poor due {{to the effect of}} a relatively high horizontal in situ stress field (horizontal to vertical stress ratio (ơ 1 ơ 3) is approximately 2 / 1). The Permian Bulli Coal seam is mined from a portion of the basin which has undergone relatively little tectonic deformation apart from faulting and regional warping. The ơ 1 orientation acting on mine roadways is determined using the mining induced shear fractures and is comparable to results from in situ overcore measurements. The angle between ơ 1 and the mine roadway (0 sr) together with the ơ 1 magnitude and the ơ 1 /ơ 2 ratio defines the range of <b>roof</b> <b>conditions</b> to be expected in a mine roadway. A twelve point scale of stress induced roof failure has been developed to rank the severity of stress acting across the mine roadway. For a given stress field the <b>roof</b> <b>conditions</b> expected over the range of Osr is defined by a Roof Failure curve. A number of Roof Failure Curves are able to define <b>roof</b> <b>conditions</b> for a varying stress field. The distribution of Roof Failure Curves represents the relative changes in stress field intensity across the mapped area. Mapping techniques are able to show the variability of both relative stress field intensity and lateral stress field orientation. Successful management of the in situ stress effects in mine development drivages and around longwall blocks is crucial to the economic viability of coal mines in the southern Sydney Basin. To further understand the origin of the in situ stress field a technique was developed to measure strain anisotropy in the coal maceral vitrinite. Vitrinite mean maximum reflectance (Ŕo max), using oil immersion, was measured from oriented sections normal to bedding and results indicate that the vitrinite in medium volatile bituminous coals has biaxial optical properties.

40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} underground mapping {{and rock}} strength tests {{to describe and}} analyze mine <b>roof</b> <b>conditions</b> surrounding ancient stream channel deposits (paleochannels) in the Pittsburgh Coalbed in southwestern Pennsylvania. Paleochannels in the study mine consist of sandstone and/or siltstone and affect the Pittsburgh Coalbed through erosion and/or differential compaction. Differentially compacted sediments within and adjacent to channel deposits caused slip planes, faults, clay-dike faults, clastic dikes (clay veins), coalbed rolls, and slumped structures. Paleochannels can be predicted by recognizing these features and associated sediments, which allows for modification of long-and short-term mine planning and development. Mine entries located beneath the paleochannel deposits exhibit less stable <b>roof</b> <b>conditions</b> than entries with normal (nonchannel) roof.

40|$|Computer vision {{can make}} {{important}} {{contributions to the}} analysis of remote sensing satellite or aerial imagery. However, the resolution of early satellite imagery was not sufficient to provide useful spatial features. The situation is changing with the advent of very-high-spatial-resolution (VHR) imaging sensors. This change makes it possible to use computer vision techniques to perform analysis of man-made structures. Meanwhile, the development of multi-view imaging techniques allows the generation of accurate point clouds as ancillary knowledge. This dissertation aims at developing computer vision and machine learning algorithms for high resolution aerial imagery analysis in the context of application problems including debris detection, building detection and <b>roof</b> <b>condition</b> assessment. High resolution aerial imagery and point clouds were provided by Pictometry International for this study. Debris detection after natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes or tsunamis, is needed for effective debris removal and allocation of limited resources. Significant advances in aerial image acquisition have greatly enabled the possibilities for rapid and automated detection of debris. In this dissertation, a robust debris detection algorithm is proposed. Large scale aerial images are partitioned into homogeneous regions by interactive segmentation. Debris areas are identified based on extracted texture features. Robust building detection is another important part of high resolution aerial imagery understanding. This dissertation develops a 3 D scene classification algorithm for building detection using point clouds derived from multi-view imagery. Point clouds are divided into point clusters using Euclidean clustering. Individual point clusters are identified based on extracted spectral and 3 D structural features. The inspection of <b>roof</b> <b>condition</b> is an important step in damage claim processing in the insurance industry. Automated <b>roof</b> <b>condition</b> assessment from remotely sensed images is proposed in this dissertation. Initially, texture classification and a bag-of-words model were applied to assess the <b>roof</b> <b>condition</b> using features derived from the whole rooftop. However, considering the complexity of residential rooftop, a more sophisticated method is proposed to divide the task into two stages: 1) roof segmentation, followed by 2) classification of segmented roof regions. Deep learning techniques are investigated for both segmentation and classification. A deep learned feature is proposed and applied in a region merging segmentation algorithm. A fine-tuned deep network is adopted for roof segment classification and found to achieve higher accuracy than traditional methods using hand-crafted features. Contributions of this study include the development of algorithms for debris detection using 2 D images and building detection using 3 D point clouds. For <b>roof</b> <b>condition</b> assessment, the solutions to this problem are explored in two directions: features derived from the whole rooftop and features extracted from each roof segments. Through our research, roof segmentation followed by segments classification was found to be a more promising method and the workflow processing developed and tested. Deep learning techniques are also investigated for both roof segmentation and segments classification. More unsupervised feature extraction techniques using deep learning can be explored in future work...|$|R
40|$|M. Sc. The coal-bearing Permian Vryheid Formation of the Ecca Group (Karoo Supergroup) was {{investigated}} at New Denmark Colliery, {{situated in the}} north east section of the Karoo Basin, South Africa. The lithostratigraphy of the sequence is {{defined in terms of}} conventional lithostratigraphic terminology but also by applying detailed genetic stratigraphic schemes that have previously been proposed for the adjacent coalfields. The succession is divided up into depositional sequences named after the underlying and overlying coal seams, the No. 2, 3, 4 and 5 seam sequences. The sedimentary succession was divided up into five facies, namely: conglomerate facies, sandstone facies, interlaminated sandstone-siltstone facies, siltstone facies and coal facies. These were interpreted hydrodynamically. Facies assemblages were then interpreted palaeoenvironmentally. Glacial, fluvial, deltaic and transgressive marine sequences were responsible for forming this sedimentary succession. Attention was then focussed on the main economic No. 4 seam, which is mined underground at the colliery. Detailed subsurface geological cross-sections, core sequences and isopach maps of the No. 4 seam coal and the lithologies above, were used to determine specific aspects of the depositional environment that could contribute to unstable <b>roof</b> <b>conditions</b> above No. 4 seam. Coarsening-upward deltaic cycles, fining-upward bedload fluvial cycles, glauconite sandstone marine transgressions and crevasse-splay deposits are recognized in the overlying strata. Poor <b>roof</b> <b>conditions</b> occur parallel to palaeochannel margins because the interbedded channel sandstone and adjacent flood plain argillites cause collapsing along bedding plane surfaces. Rider coals overlying thin crevasse-splay sequences in close proximity to the No. 4 seam, create {{one of the most serious}} roof conditions; complete collapse occurs along the rider coal contact with the underlying splay deposits. Differential compaction of mudrock/shale/siltstone over more competent sandstone causes slickensided surfaces that weaken the roof lithologies. Correct identification of these sedimentological features will enable the prediction of potential poor <b>roof</b> <b>conditions</b> during mining operations and mine planning...|$|R
