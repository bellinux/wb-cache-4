40|$|That {{the same}} story can be told in {{different}} media {{is one of the}} fundamental claims of narratology. Claude Bremond (1964) famously listed verbal narrative, novels, theater, movies and ballet among potential vehicles for story. He thus prepared the ground for narratology’s future as a discipline engaged in narrative research across media, in principle including single <b>still</b> <b>pictures.</b> However, narratological research concerned with pictorial narrativity generally proceeds from the assumption that although single pictures may evoke or imply stories, they are unsuitable for storytelling in a strict narratological sense. Focusing on the key issue of temporality, this essay will show that a single <b>still</b> <b>picture</b> may indeed tell “a story proper ” (Wolf 2003, 180) and can thus be regarded as a nar-rative, even according to a narrow definition. 1. Still single pictures: Narrativity without narrative? Mieke Bal is probably the narratologist who has most consistently analyzed single <b>still</b> <b>pictures</b> as narratives. But {{the fact is that the}} single <b>still</b> <b>pictures</b> of which she offered narrative analyses (e. g. Bal 1991, 1994, 1997) are quite in...|$|R

40|$|Master of ArtsDepartment of Modern LanguagesMary T. CoppleThis study {{investigates the}} {{effectiveness}} of visuals in the language classroom. Two types of visual aids commonly used in the language classroom, video and <b>still</b> <b>pictures,</b> are used to elicit narratives from L 2 English speakers, and these narratives are subsequently compared. The data come from eleven international students from a university English Language Program, who voluntarily participated in two separate 15 -minute interviews. In each interview session, they were shown either a series of pictures or a video, both depicting a story. Upon completion of the presentation of each visual, participants were asked a prompt question and their narration of the events portrayed in the visuals recorded. The narratives were transcribed and analyzed {{in order to test}} (1) if <b>still</b> <b>pictures</b> and video are equally effective in eliciting elaboration in the narratives, defined in this case, as the number of new referents introduced and the number of adjective and verb types produced; and (2) if exposure to <b>still</b> <b>pictures</b> and video elicit narrations of similar length. Both kinds of visuals stimulated learners to create narratives and elaborate on what had been shown in them. The video task elicited narratives roughly 10 % longer than the picture task in regards to the raw number of words. When linguistic factors were compared, participants introduced new referents at comparable rates in both tasks while they employed 10 % more verb types in the video task. Additionally, the series of <b>still</b> <b>pictures</b> prompted participants to employ a much higher number of adjective types. These observations suggest that a series of <b>still</b> <b>pictures</b> are an effective alternative for video for eliciting narratives. This study provides support for the use of <b>still</b> <b>pictures</b> as an equivalent to videos in situations where videos are less accessible in language classrooms (due to lack of technological access) ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: With the {{advancement}} of ultrasound-guidance for peripheral nerve blocks, <b>still</b> <b>pictures</b> from representative ultrasonograms are increasingly used for clinical procedure documentation of the procedure and for educational purposes in textbook materials. However, little is actually known about the clinical and educational usefulness of these <b>still</b> <b>pictures,</b> in particular how well nerve structures can be identified compared to real-time ultrasound examination. We aimed to quantify gross visibility or ultrastructure using <b>still</b> <b>picture</b> sonograms compared to real time ultrasound for trainees and experts, for large or small nerves, and discuss the clinical or educational relevance of these findings. Materials and Methods: We undertook a clinical study to quantify the maximal gross visibility or ultrastructure of seven peripheral nerves identified by either real time ultrasound (clinical cohort, n = 635) or by <b>still</b> <b>picture</b> ultrasonograms (clinical cohort, n = 112). In addition, we undertook a study on test subjects (n = 4) to quantify interobserver variations and potential bias among expert and trainee observers. Results: When comparing real time ultrasound and interpretation of <b>still</b> <b>picture</b> sonograms, gross identification of large nerves was reduced by 15 % and 40 % by expert and trainee observers, respectively, while gross identification of small nerves was reduced by 29 % and 66 %. Identification of within-nerve ultrastructure was even less. For all nerve sizes, trainees were unable to identify any anatomical structure in 24 to 34 %, while experts were unable to identify anything in 9 to 10 %...|$|R
50|$|The Main <b>Still</b> <b>Picture</b> profile {{allows for}} a single <b>still</b> <b>picture</b> to be encoded with the same {{constraints}} as the Main profile. As {{a subset of the}} Main profile the Main <b>Still</b> <b>Picture</b> profile {{allows for a}} bit depth of 8-bits per sample with 4:2:0 chroma sampling. An objective performance comparison was done in April 2012 in which HEVC reduced the average bit rate for images by 56% compared to JPEG. A PSNR based performance comparison for still image compression was done in May 2012 using the HEVC HM 6.0 encoder and the reference software encoders for the other standards. For still images HEVC reduced the average bit rate by 15.8% compared to H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, 22.6% compared to JPEG 2000, 30.0% compared to JPEG XR, 31.0% compared to WebP, and 43.0% compared to JPEG.|$|R
