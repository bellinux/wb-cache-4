5|$|Rachel, who is {{spending}} {{most of her time}} in her hotel room on account of her pregnancy, receives a visit from her expatriated lesbian sister Lucy (Susannah Doyle). Lucy tells Rachel that she has been sleeping around with men {{in order to have a}} child. When Adam learns of this, he suggests to Lucy that she use some of his banked sperm. They broach the idea to Rachel, who is disgusted at the thought of her husband having a baby with her sister and forbids it from going ahead. Meanwhile, Karen finally assures David that the animosity between them caused by his extramarital affair is in the past. She emails Mark Cubitt (Sean Pertwee), a man she has been having an affair with in England, to tell him their fling is over. Mark arrives at her apartment the next morning and spends the day with her after David cancels a visit to an art gallery with her. He convinces her that David is <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> insensitive man that he has always been. The next day, Karen tells Rachel that she will leave David to be with Mark.|$|E
5|$|Reaching the cascade, {{or rather}} cataract, the roaring {{of which had}} a long time {{announced}} its vicinity, my soul was hurried by the falls into a new train of reflections. The impetuous dashing of the rebounding torrent from the dark cavities which mocked the exploring eye, produced an equal activity in my mind: my thoughts darted from earth to heaven, and I asked myself why I was chained to life and its misery? Still the tumultuous emotions this sublime object excited, were pleasurable; and, viewing it, my soul rose, with renewed dignity, above its cares – grasping at immortality – it seemed as impossible to stop the current of my thoughts, as of the always varying, <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> torrent before me – I stretched out my hand to eternity, bounding over the dark speck of life to come.|$|E
5|$|E.V.O.: Search for Eden is a side-scrolling {{platformer}} action {{game where}} players must navigate {{a creature of}} their own design across a number of environments resembling Earth's past. The game is divided into five distinct geological periods: the Cambrian Period and the Ordovician Period of the Paleozoic Era ("The World Before Land") from 500 million years ago to 450 million years ago, then the Carboniferous period ("Early Creatures of Land"), the Mesozoic Era ("Age of Dinosaurs"), the late Neogene period ("Ice Age"), and finally the early Quaternary period ("Early Man"). Each period has its own map screen, which is divided into various levels. While each era takes historical liberties with both its inhabitants and time frames, the player's choices for evolution are dependent on the current era of play, ranging from aquatic bodies during the Age of Fish to mammalian physiology during the Age of Man. During the first two eras you are forced to gain a new body to progress, but once you reach the Age of Dinosaurs, a side quest {{will give you the}} option to remain as a reptile, or become a bird, gaining the ability of flight. As you enter the Ice Age as a bird or reptile, you are immediately given the option to become a mammal. You can finish the game as a reptile, bird, or mammal and the outcome is <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> only the interaction dialogue is affected by your choices.|$|E

25|$|In a Wankel engine, the {{fuel-air}} mixture {{cannot be}} pre-stored {{because there are}} consecutive intake cycles. The engine has a 50% longer stroke duration than a reciprocating piston engine.

25|$|To {{make the}} PSP slimmer, the {{capacity}} of the battery was reduced by 1/3. However, due to more efficient power usage, the run time of the PSP is <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as the previous model. Older model batteries will work which extends the amount of playing time. However, the battery cover on the newer model does not fit over the older battery due to its bulkier size. The batteries take about one and a half hour to charge and last roughly 4.5–7 hours depending on factors such as screen brightness settings, WLAN and volume levels.|$|E
25|$|The {{establishment}} of the Scandinavian Episcopal Conference followed only two months after that of the Apostolic Delegation. Convoked by the Apostolic Delegate, the entire hierarchy of the five countries met in Bergen (South Norway) on May 1, 1960, with the prime purpose of founding a proper bishops' conference. Some participants were <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as in 1951 (Bishops Cobben, Mangers, Suhr, and Wember). Newcomers were Bishops Ansgar Nelson, O.S.B., of Stockholm (b. 1906), Johannes Gunnarson, S.M.M., of Iceland (1897-1972), and Johannes Rüth, SS.CC., of Central Norway (1899 - 1978).|$|E
25|$|The Zonda R Evolución is {{an updated}} version of the Zonda R. It {{features}} many changes over the previous Zonda R. Also the car takes many pieces and inspirations from the Zonda 760RS. It is finished in pearl white with exposed carbon-fibre on the nose. The 6.0L V12 engine is uprated to 800PS. The body work is <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> but has improved aerodynamics. It features a bigger air splitter above the two standard air splitters on the front bumper and a pair of small splitters {{on the sides of the}} rear bumper. A bigger rear central fin— even bigger than the 760 series Zondas— and a small spoiler added below the standard Zonda R spoiler improves aerodynamics and increases down-force.|$|E

25|$|After Adolf Hitler {{took power}} in 1933, the {{official}} {{name of the}} state was <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> For {{a couple of years}} Hitler used the expression Drittes Reich (Third Reich), which was introduced by writers {{in the last years of}} the republic. In fact this was only a propaganda term and did not constitute a new state. Another propaganda term was Tausendjähriges Reich (Thousand years Reich). Later Hitler renounced the term Drittes Reich (officially in June 1939), but it already had become popular among supporters and opponents and is still used in historiography (sometimes in quotation marks). It led later to the name Zweites Reich (Second Empire) for Germany of 1871–1919. The reign of Hitler is most commonly called in English Nazi Germany. Nazi is a colloquial short for Nationalsozialist.|$|E
25|$|Another problem {{commonly}} {{faced by}} narrow-gauge railways {{was that they}} lack the physical space to grow: their cheap construction meant they were engineered only for their initial traffic demands. While a standard or broad gauge railway can be more easily be upgraded to handle heavier, faster traffic, many narrow-gauge railways were impractical to improve. Speeds and loads hauled could not increase, so traffic density was significantly limited. In the case of Queensland, Australia, the Queensland Rail passenger network has nearly reached its capacity due to the narrow gauge and an ever-increasing population, as such, new lines are to be built, thus negating the original cost savings. In Japan, a few narrow gauge lines have been upgraded to standard gauge mini-shinkansen to allow through service by standard gauge high-speed vehicles, but due to the alignment of those lines and minimum curve radius of those lines, the maximum speed of those through service is <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as the original narrow-gauge rail line.|$|E
25|$|Kǎishū style (traditional regular script) — {{still in}} use today — and {{attributed}} to Wang Xizhi (王羲之, 303-361) and his followers, is even more regularized. Its spread was encouraged by Emperor Mingzong of Later Tang (926-933), who ordered the printing of the classics using new wooden blocks in Kaishu. Printing technologies here allowed shapes to stabilize. The Kaishu shape of characters 1000 years ago was mostly similar to {{that at the end}} of Imperial China. But small changes have been made, for example in the shape of 广 which is not absolutely the same in the Kangxi Dictionary of 1716 as in modern books. The Kangxi and current shapes have tiny differences, while stroke order is <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> according to old style., 厂 or 广, p.41. The 2007 common shape for those characters does not clearly show the stroke order, but old versions, visible on the Kangxi Zidian p.41 clearly allow the stroke order to be determined.|$|E

25|$|Finland {{maintained}} {{good relations}} with the Western powers. The Finnish government stressed that Finland was fighting as a co-belligerent with Germany against the Soviet Union only to protect itself. Furthermore, Finland stressed that it was <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> democratic country as {{it had been in the}} Winter War. However, on 12 July 1941, the United Kingdom signed an agreement of joint action with the Soviet Union. Furthermore, under German pressure, Finland had to close the British legation in Helsinki. As a result, diplomatic relations between Finland and the United Kingdom were broken on 1August. On 28 November, Britain presented Finland an ultimatum demanding that Finland cease military operations by 3 December. Unofficially, Finland informed the Western powers that Finnish troops would halt their advance in the next few days. The reply did not satisfy the United Kingdom, which declared war on Finland on 6 December. The Commonwealth member states of Canada, Australia, British Raj, and New Zealand followed suit.|$|E
25|$|Lodge was a Christian Spiritualist. In 1909 he {{published}} the book Survival of Man which expressed {{his belief that}} life after death had been demonstrated by mediumship. His most controversial book was Raymond or Life and Death (1916). The book documented the séances {{that he and his}} wife had attended with the medium Gladys Osborne Leonard. Lodge was convinced that his son Raymond had communicated with him and the book is a description of his son's experiences in the spirit world. According to the book Raymond had reported that people who had died were <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> people when they passed over, there were houses, trees and flowers and the Spirit world looked similar to earth but there is no disease. The book also claimed that when soldiers died in World War I they had smoked cigars and received whisky in the spirit world and because of such statements the book was criticised. Walter Cook wrote a rebuttal to Lodge Reflections on Raymond (1917) that directly challenged Lodge's beliefs in Spiritualism.|$|E
25|$|After Hazumu's {{transformation}} into a girl, Asuta suddenly finds {{his good friend}} Hazumu very attractive, and cannot help himself when he starts thinking about Hazumu in a sexual way. During the time when Hazumu and her friends go to the beach, Asuta continuously tries to remind himself that even though Hazumu's body has changed, the person is <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> and as her best friend, {{he should not be}} thinking about her in a sexual way. Hazumu remains oblivious to the fact throughout the series that Asuta has been often thinking about her in a sexual way. Asuta continues to have fantasies about having Hazumu as a girlfriend as well. Overtime, Asuta realizes that Hazumu and him gradually grow apart from each other, or are at least not as close as they once had been when Hazumu was a boy. He does find it excellent that his friend is now a very attractive girl, but only wants to continue being Hazumu's friend and nothing more, constantly beating himself up for having impure thoughts about Hazumu. In the last pages of the manga, he announces to the others that he has found a girlfriend, and shows them a photograph of her. They remark that she looks a lot like Hazumu.|$|E
