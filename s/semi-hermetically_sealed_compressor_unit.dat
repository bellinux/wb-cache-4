After overcoming many teething problems, Godrej was successful in producing the first 230 Volt Model 9 refrigerator, having a capacity of 7.3 cubic feet, in 1958. For more than a decade, several different models were introduced. In 1962, Godrej, which had been using the imported GEC <b>compressor</b> <b>unit,</b> began manufacturing hermetically <b>sealed</b> <b>compressors</b> in India.|$|R

40|$|We {{have lost}} the war with energy. Our post World War II dream of a {{suburban}} utopia based on cheap abundant energy is dead and has been rendered unsustainable. We have created a vast territory of simulated autonomy. This territory, still tethered to our energy networks, is a relentless swath of meandering streets flanked by banal serial repetitions of roof and shell stuffed with the latest inventions of modern electric living. Designed with a seemingly unlimited energy supply, the paper-thin structures have zero regard for efficiency, orientation, or even climatic region. They manifest themselves {{to be nothing more}} than a nuclear <b>semi-hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> environment. What is the future? The future of this territory is the reality of the post-war of energy {{and the creation of a}} new real autonomy. The architecture of energy will be based on responsiveness to its environment, its adaptability during times of crisis, its ability to become and produce energy (stored and potential), and its severed ties to the existing network.

40|$|Abstract — A {{refrigeration}} system achieves its refrigeration function generally through cryogenic refrigerant generated by multiple refrigerant <b>compressor</b> <b>units.</b> Traditionally, {{the operation of}} refrigerant <b>compressor</b> <b>units</b> is controlled only by experience or the proportional-integral-derivative controller of refrigerant temperature or pressure. Due {{to the lack of}} scientific, systematic and optimum logic basis, it is difficult to optimize the operation of {{refrigeration system}} and control the excessive energy consumption with these methods. On this basis, this study employs the system optimization method to determine the optimum operation of each <b>compressor</b> <b>unit</b> within the system to obtain the most energy-saving operation for maximum operation efficiency of the refrigeration system (energy consumption efficiency), according to the actual required refrigeration capacity at load side, actual performance and operation condition of each unit. The results reflect that the system optimization method can obtain the optimum solution and increase the coefficient of performance of the original refrigeration system by 7. 83 %.
