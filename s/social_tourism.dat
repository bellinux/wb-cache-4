In addition, a comprehensive welfare state was established, while improvements were made to social programmes such as pensions and unemployment benefits.

5000|$|Greece has 752 thermosprings. Many {{have been}} {{classified}} as therapeutic by the National Institute for Geographical and Mineral Research. Several {{of them were}} known and exploited already since antiquity. Thermal or curative tourism was, after all, {{one of the earliest}} forms of tourism in the ancient world. In 1983 was founded the Hellenic Association of Municipalities with Thermal Springs http://www.thermalsprings.gr/index.php/en/thermal-springs/geographical-search Some of these ancient [...] "spa resorts" [...] were situated in Aidipsos, known from the time of Aristotle, Loutraki, mentioned by Xenophon, Traianoupoli http://www.thermalsprings.gr/index.php/en/component/content/article/83-thermal-springs-presentation/east-macedonia-and-thrace/131-traianoupoli-en, founded by the emperor Trajan in the 2nd century A.D., whereas some others are attested in the Byzantine period, such as the Thermal baths of Langadas http://www.thermalsprings.gr/index.php/en/component/content/article/74-thermal-springs-presentation/central-macedonia/118-lagkada-en. In the late 19th {{and the beginning of the}} 20th century these hot springs were surrounded by cosmopolitan facilities, namely hotels and restaurants, whereas several prominent members of the society of both the Modern Greek State and the Ottoman State (for regions still incorporated in it) invested in touristic infrastructure and private estates. Thermal tourism became particularly widespread in the 1960s and 1970s, whereas in the 1980s it was widely supported by a <b>social</b> <b>tourism</b> program, which subsidized large part of the expenses for the elderly users of the facilities. Nowadays, however, there is an urgent need to refurbish, restore and elevate these spas to modern standards and create an international clientele. Visitors, however, can already find high-standard touristic facilities in Pozar http://www.loutrapozar.net/, in Aidipsos http://www.thermalsprings.gr/index.php/en/component/content/article/78-thermal-springs-presentation/central-greece/141-aidipsos-en and in Kamena Vourla http://www.thermalsprings.gr/index.php/en/component/content/article/78-thermal-springs-presentation/central-greece/145-kamena-vourla-en, in Loutraki close to Corinth http://www.thermalsprings.gr/index.php/en/component/content/article/80-thermal-springs-presentation/peloponnese/158-loutraki-agioi-theodoroi-en as well as at Kaiafas, on the western shores of the Peloponnese http://www.thermalsprings.gr/index.php/en/component/content/article/84-thermal-springs-presentation/west-greece/154-kaiafa-en.

40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>tourism</b> is a contested concept, practised {{little in}} the UK, but more widely {{throughout}} mainland Europe. However, limited research demonstrates its benefits to recipients. The emergence of <b>social</b> <b>tourism</b> has occurred through a historical and discursive process linked to organised capitalism and modern civil society. <b>Social</b> <b>tourism</b> {{has the capacity to}} transcend traditional and commercial concepts of tourism and challenge purely market-based tourist and leisure activities. Supporters can make the case for <b>social</b> <b>tourism</b> on the UK policy agenda through the following: more holistic research into <b>social</b> <b>tourism</b> and its benefits; the use of current government changes around the public health structure; and integration of <b>social</b> <b>tourism</b> into community needs around social capital and local health and wellbeing intervention development...|$|E
40|$|Recently, the European Commission (EC) {{has placed}} {{a focus on}} <b>social</b> <b>tourism</b> issues within Europe. The {{underlying}} logic of this intervention is that <b>social</b> <b>tourism</b> aims for social equity, aiding access to tourism to provide fair tourism for all citizens and contributing towards sustainability of the European tourism industry. By linking <b>social</b> <b>tourism</b> to sustainable development, the EC sets priorities for future policies to foster mobility within the community. Yet, most European countries have different approaches, priorities and diverse ideological interpretations {{of the role of}} the state in tourism provision. Consequently, systems and practices vary strongly between nations and seem to put the ideal of a common approach a very distant prospect. This paper outlines the context of these approaches to <b>social</b> <b>tourism</b> to highlight these challenges and to propose initiatives for the future integration of the European <b>social</b> <b>tourism</b> sector. It presents a comparative analysis of <b>social</b> <b>tourism</b> systems in seven European countries with important <b>social</b> <b>tourism</b> structures. The paper assesses different interpretations of <b>social</b> <b>tourism,</b> examining development and employment issues.
