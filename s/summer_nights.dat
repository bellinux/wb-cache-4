25|$|Those who sail {{up along}} the coast of Norway to trade or to fish, all tell the {{remarkable}} story of how a serpent of fearsome size, 200 feet long and 20 feet wide, resides in rifts and caves outside Bergen. On bright <b>summer</b> <b>nights</b> this serpent leaves the caves to eat calves, lambs and pigs, or it fares out to the sea and feeds on sea nettles, crabs and similar marine animals. It has ell-long hair hanging from its neck, sharp black scales and flaming red eyes. It attacks vessels, grabs and swallows people, as it lifts itself up like a column from the water.|$|E

500|$|From 1845 to 1850, Chivers {{had been}} living {{with his wife in}} Georgia, then spent the next five years in the North. His poetry {{collection}} Eonchs of Ruby, A Gift of Love was published in 1851 with a subtitle meant to capitalize on the gift book trend. Chivers explained the title: [...] "The Word Eonch is the same as Concha Marina—Shell of the Sea. Eonch is used... merely for its euphony." [...] Throughout the collection, Chivers experiments with the sonic effects of words rather than their literal meaning. Atlanta: or the True Blessed Island of Poesy: A Paul Epic in Three Lustra was first published in three installments in the Georgia Citizen beginning in January 1853. Later that year, Memoralia; or, Philas of Amber Full of the Tears of Love was printed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and generally received unfavorably. Very shortly after, the same publisher brought out Virginalia; or, Songs of My <b>Summer</b> <b>Nights,</b> a collection made up of poems that were generally under 200 lines each, about half of which had previously been published in magazines.|$|E
500|$|In early 1964, Wilson {{began his}} {{breakaway}} from beach-themed music. That November, Melody Maker reported that Love {{and the group}} wanted to look beyond surf rock and avoid {{living in the past}} or resting on the band's laurels. When Wilson resigned from touring in order to focus on songwriting and producing, the rest of the band assumed that he would continue making music that their audiences expected of them. [...] Although The Beach Boys Today! and Summer Days (And <b>Summer</b> <b>Nights!!)</b> (both released in 1965) were more sophisticated and elaborate than previous albums, they were still within the realm of acceptability for the band, producing a reasonable level of record sales and chart activity. This was not the case for the next two album projects recorded over 1966 and 1967, where Wilson's bandmates were not entirely supportive of his new creative ambitions. Wilson was also encumbered by pressure from Capitol Records and the group's fanbase. While the band's contemporaries grew more intellectually aware, Capitol continued to bill the Beach Boys as [...] "America’s Top Surfin' Group!", expecting Wilson to write more surfing material for the yearly summer markets, despite his growing disinterest.|$|E
