40|$|The diploma {{thesis is}} focused on the {{features}} description of electronics switches for digital <b>switching</b> <b>arrays</b> and on the design of program for optimal calculation of switching points and the figure of switches in digital <b>switching</b> <b>arrays</b> investigation. The electronics switches types, used for time circuit separation, are described in the preamble. These switches are the base of digital <b>switching</b> <b>arrays</b> and in principal two types are defined: the switch S and switch T. The switch S allows the interconnection only of the same channel intervals from incoming circuit with random outgoing circuit. The switch S is being used in multistage <b>switching</b> <b>arrays</b> in combination with the switches T because it can not be used separately. The switch T allows exchanging the time position of incoming circuit to different time position of outgoing circuit depending on connection needs. The time switch can substitute the space switch under specific work conditions. In practice, the time switch with controlled reading and writing is used. The following part of diploma thesis {{is focused on}} the designs and calculations of optimal switching points of digital <b>switching</b> <b>array</b> which is the executive unit of switching systems. These systems directly interconnect the signals from digital multiplexes and make the basic assumptions for telecommunication networks integration. The digital <b>switching</b> <b>array</b> means the equipment which is able to connect the channels of digital multiplexes carrying the information in encoding form. The multiplexes are the most often with pulse coded modulation or adaptive delta modulation. The digital <b>switching</b> <b>arrays</b> are divided into the time and space one. The <b>switching</b> <b>arrays</b> of digital <b>switching</b> systems can be made by time <b>switching</b> <b>array</b> T whose realization is limited to specific capacity or by the connection of multistage arrays. Single stages sequenced one behind each other are made by the switches T and S. The space array S does not allow making the digital <b>switching</b> <b>array</b> of <b>switching</b> centre. The program which determines possible proposals of <b>switching</b> <b>arrays</b> from defined figure of inputs and calculates the optimal figure of switching points and switches is a part of diploma thesis...|$|R

40|$|Within {{the space}} of a few years, IT {{companies}} with need for large-scale datacenters are considering alternatives to building traditional central datacenter facility. They have embraced a modular datacenter (also called pod, a smaller mobile datacenter) as the building block for reasons such as efficient cooling, power savings, mobility, easier deployment and administration. However, delivering scalable inter-pod bisection bandwidth remains a challenge. Current solutions that promise full bisection bandwidth between arbitrary pair of hosts can be expensive and power-intensive for interconnecting modular datacenters. Our recent work [FPR+ 10] proposed Helios, a scalable switch architecture for interconnecting modular datacenters using a hybrid core <b>switch</b> <b>array</b> consisting of electrical and optical switches. We show that Helios delivers a significant reduction in cost, cabling complexity, and power while providing scalable on-demand bandwidth to the communicating pair of hosts.

Use of tongue movement was proposed as a control command for an FES system, because even quadriplegic patients can move their tongue voluntarily and generate much information easily. In this paper, we investigated the tongue movement by using a simple measurement system that simulated an input part of control commands in an FES system. The measurement system consisted of a 16 -key membrane <b>switch</b> <b>array,</b> and a personal computer. The <b>switch</b> <b>array</b> detected the tongue movement as shift of touching area of the buccal region. We measured and discussed recognition rates by which the measurement system could recognize direction of tongue movement correctly. In this discussion, we assumed the following command-rules; transverse and longitudinal direction were accepted as a command, and reentry was required if oblique direction or undetected condition occurred. Five healthy subjects operated the system by their tongue in experiments, and the recognition rates were calculated. The rates within three entries were more than 85 % even by less-experienced subjects; more than 95 % by some subjects. The results of experiments during 5 days indicated that the repeatability of {{the recognition of the}} tongue movement was high.

40|$|Chapter I {{examines}} current {{usage and}} existing theory of switching amplifiers. Areas where existing or potential usage extend beyond published theory are defined, {{the most important}} area being the lack of adequate switching wave descriptions. The work aimed at redressing the imbalance {{between theory and practice}} is described and its relationship to the thesis outlined. In Chapter II the steps necessary to form a switching wave description are outlined. The amplifier features incorporated include details of the encoder, the <b>switch</b> <b>array,</b> and the control signals which flow between encoder and <b>switch</b> <b>array.</b> The input-output characteristic and other design features are combined with the requirements of the encoder and <b>switch</b> <b>array</b> to define restrictions on the switch control signals and the switching wave. In Chapter III detailed switching waveform descriptions are derived for waves controlled by natural samplers, modified natural samplers, and regular samplers. The low frequency components of the descriptions are used to define the sampling wave shapes needed to achieve specific input-output characteristics for amplifiers with both d. c. and a. c. supply waveforms. A modified natural sampler is described which permits compensation for arbitary supply waveform perturbations. The high frequency components of the waveforms are an important by-product of the method of derivation. In Chapter IV the fidelity of information transfer through switching amplifiers is examined. The waveform descriptions are used to evaluate the spectrum of passband noise for natural and regular sampling control with both d. c. and a. c. supplies. The inter-relationship between signal quality, bandwidth, and sampling rate is derived for each amplifier, and comparisons are made between amplifiers. Chapter V provides a basis for the analysis of the low frequency performance of switching amplifiers embedded in feedback networks. The application of the analysis to amplifiers using any form of natural sampling is demonstrated and the extension to regular sampling outlined. The method described also provides criteria not previously described elsewhere. Chapter VI deals with the class of self-oscillating encoders based on a linear filter feedback path and a comparator with hysteresis. The performance limits of the simplest system are described. A method for predicting the d. c. input-output characteristic of all such encoders is presented and its application to two particular encoders discussed. Chapter VII describes a switching amplifier {{from the point of view}} of energy flow from source to load. The restrictions on amplifier structure and performance imposed by this view, and by real components, are outlined and some of the limits imposed by present hardware briefly discussed.

Once this temperature is reached, TSA is automatically turned on to increase the thermal conductance, working as an effective thermal spreader.
