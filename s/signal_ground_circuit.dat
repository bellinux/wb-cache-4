50|$|A {{different}} {{take on the}} standard tone control is the Varitone circuit sometimes used on Gibson guitars (such as the Blueshawk). The Varitone is actually a variable notch filter consisting of one of several capacitors (selected with a rotary switch) in series with an inductor, forming an LC circuit. When placed between the <b>signal</b> and <b>ground,</b> this <b>circuit</b> starts to attenuate frequencies around its resonant frequency, {{as determined by the}} following formula:While this control is not very common in guitars, a number of aftermarket versions are available, both with and without an inductor (the latter being a simple low-pass filter with a movable cutoff frequency).|$|R
40|$|An {{isolation}} circuit is disclosed for isolating ground {{interference from}} a wideband transmission <b>signal.</b> The <b>ground</b> isolation <b>circuit</b> {{of the present}} invention is constructed using a pair of matched mixer circuits. each of which receives a carrier signal from the same oscillator circuit. The first mixer circuit also receives the baseband signal input after appropriate conditioning, and modulates the baseband signal onto the carrier signal. In the preferred embodiment, the carrier signal has a predetermined frequency which is at least two times {{the frequency of the}} baseband signal. The modulated signal (which preferably comprises an rf signal) is transmitted via an rf transmission line to the second mixer, which demodulates the rf signal to recover the baseband signal. Each port of the mixer circuits connects to an isolation transformer to insure isolation from ground interference...|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a driven <b>ground</b> electrical <b>circuit.</b> A driven <b>ground</b> is a current-measuring ground termination to an electrical circuit {{with the current}} measured as a vector with amplification. The driven ground module may include an electric potential source V. sub. S driving an electric current through an impedance (load Z) to a driven ground. Voltage from the source V. sub. S excites the minus terminal of an operational amplifier inside the driven ground which, in turn, may react by generating an equal and opposite voltage to drive the net potential to approximately zero (effectively ground). A driven ground {{may also be a}} means of passing information via the current passing through one <b>grounded</b> <b>circuit</b> to another electronic circuit as input. It may <b>ground</b> one <b>circuit,</b> amplify the information carried in its current and pass this information on as input to the next circuit...|$|R
5000|$|Types II to IV are {{variants}} which {{attempt to}} overcome the main limitation of Type I, which is the reference to Earth {{at each end of}} the circuit. Types II-IV use the Signal Battery (SB) and <b>Signal</b> <b>Ground</b> (SG) lead in conjunction with the E&M wires. This improves noise immunity as the <b>Signal</b> <b>Ground</b> does not carry the same heavy currents as normal Ground connections and provides a low resistance return path for signaling. However, if the main Ground connection fails all Earth current may flow via the interface, causing signaling failure, hum and in extreme cases destruction of equipment.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>signal</b> <b>ground</b> is {{a common}} return for the other connections; it appears on two pins in the Yost {{standard}} but is the same signal.

5000|$|A common {{communications}} link {{used by many}} people is the asynchronous start-stop, or just [...] "asynchronous", serial link. If you have an external modem attached to your home or office computer, the chances are that the connection is over an asynchronous serial connection. Its advantage {{is that it is}} simple [...] - [...] it can be implemented using only three wires: Send, Receive and <b>Signal</b> <b>Ground</b> (or <b>Signal</b> Common). In an RS232 interface, an idle connection has a continuous negative voltage applied. A 'zero' bit is represented as a positive voltage difference with respect to the <b>Signal</b> <b>Ground</b> and a 'one' bit is a negative voltage with respect to <b>signal</b> <b>ground,</b> thus indistinguishable from the idle state. This means you need to know when a 'one' bit starts to distinguish it from idle. This is done by agreeing in advance how fast data will be transmitted over a link, then using a start bit to signal the start of a byte [...] - [...] this start bit will be a 'zero' bit. Stop bits are 'one' bits i.e. negative voltage.|$|R
25|$|<b>Signal</b> <b>grounds</b> {{serve as}} return paths for signals and power (at extra low voltages, less than about 50 V) within equipment, {{and on the}} signal {{interconnections}} between equipment. Many electronic designs feature a single return {{that acts as a}} reference for all signals. Power and <b>signal</b> <b>grounds</b> often get connected, usually through the metal case of the equipment. Designers of printed circuit boards must take care in the layout of electronic systems so that high-power or rapidly switching currents in one part of a system do not inject noise into low-level sensitive parts of a system due to some common impedance in the grounding traces of the layout.|$|R
50|$|The {{line level}} signal is an {{alternating}} current signal without a DC offset, meaning that its voltage varies {{with respect to}} <b>signal</b> <b>ground</b> from the peak amplitude (for example +1.5 V) to the equivalent negative voltage (−1.5 V).|$|R
5000|$|One such {{source of}} ground noise is the {{isolated}} ground loop. The isolated ground loop {{differs from the}} ground loop in {{that there is no}} secondary connection to power supply ground or other non-signal <b>ground.</b> Instead two <b>signal</b> <b>ground</b> conductors (such as the outer conductor of stereo coaxial audio wire) are common at the amplifier input (by an internal connection in the multi-channel amplifier), they travel some distance whereupon they experience different induction currents and then are made common at some other secondary location (typically a multi-channel signal source device), as in stereo patch cords. The induction currents being different for each of the two outer coaxial conductors set up a current between the two which results in a difference in potential appearing at the negative input terminals at the amplifier, with respect to the positive input terminals. The problem is made worse by the increasing the length of the cables, and their proximity to devices radiating magnetic noise. One solution to this problem incorporates the use of a single ground conductor as a shield (see coax) and the use of multiple other separated internal conductors as positive signal wires inside a single shield conductor, allowing for several separate and distinct positive signals to all arrive at the amplifier input referenced to a single ground shield conductor. This method also insures that all the signal conductors and the single ground shield conductor (like coax) all experience similar induction of unwanted signals. Another solution is the incorporation of [...] "star topology" [...] <b>signal</b> <b>grounding</b> technique wherein no <b>signal</b> <b>ground</b> ever connects to any other <b>signal</b> <b>ground,</b> except at a single centralized location.|$|R

50|$|In {{digital and}} radio {{frequency}} PCBs, {{the major reason}} for using large ground planes is to reduce electrical noise and interference through ground loops and to prevent crosstalk between adjacent circuit traces. When digital circuits switch state, large current pulses flow from the active devices (transistors or integrated <b>circuits)</b> through the <b>ground</b> <b>circuit.</b> If the power supply and ground traces have significant impedance, the voltage drop across them may create noise voltage pulses that disturb {{other parts of the}} <b>circuit</b> (<b>ground</b> bounce). The large conducting area of the ground plane has much lower impedance than a circuit trace, so the current pulses cause less disturbance.|$|R

50|$|In {{practice}} this case usually {{does not happen}} because the pickup cartridge, an inductive voltage source, need have no connection to the turntable metalwork, and so the <b>signal</b> <b>ground</b> is isolated from the chassis or protective ground at that end of the link.
