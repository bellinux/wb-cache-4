5000|$|The <b>sweetlip</b> emperor (Lethrinus miniatus), also {{referred}} to as the <b>sweetlip</b> swoose, is a fish of the Lethrinidae family. It can be found on coral reefs and moderately warm waters in the Western Pacific Ocean, although its primary habitat is the Great Barrier Reef. It can also be found in the coastal regions in the centre of Western Australia.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sweetlip</b> {{emperors}} have {{a strange}} breeding and development pattern. Off {{the coast of}} Cairns, they spawn almost all the time. Off the coast of Townsville, they mate in June and August, and off the coast in October and November in more southern waters. These different breeding times are due to different water temperatures. <b>Sweetlip</b> emperors can spawn (like eggs that hatch eventually) only in warmer water.|$|E

50|$|Today, {{species of}} emperor in the reef (including the <b>sweetlip</b> emperor) are {{threatened}} {{because they are}} desired by both commercial fishing operations and pleasure fishers, due to their lovely colour and nice taste.|$|E

50|$|The reef {{has more}} than 175 fish species. There are more species and {{varieties}} of corals in this one area {{than any other single}} reef on the Great Barrier Reef. The diverse amount of marine life include schools of wrasse, <b>sweetlip,</b> trevally, parrotfish, bat, surgeon, turtles and tropical fish. Manta rays, wobbegongs and leopard sharks are among the larger creatures that reside here. Sightings of whaler sharks are sometimes seen on the eastern side of Flinders. During the months of June to September, humpback whales can be seen on the surface as they pass by.|$|E

40|$|Five {{artificial}} reef {{sites in the}} vicinity of Tanegashima were investigated through underwater observation, as to the degree of shoaling, scouring, general condition, and fish gathering patterns. These reefs were located in relatively shallow sandy bottom areas, at depths from 12 - 28 m. The reefs are generally of a single layer construction, with the blocks concentrated into an area with a maximum height of only 3 m. The shallow reefs are generally subject to shoaling effects. Regions with sea beds showing sediment transport ripples have the highest shoaling effect. A maximum shoaling rate of 8 - 9 cm/year was calculated for the reefs. Due to the shallow nature of these reefs, schools of the following larval fishes were observed {{in the shadow of the}} reefs: Spratelloides japonicus (banded blue sprat), Apogon semilineatus (bottom perch), Trachurus japonicus (Japanese horse mackerel), Scomber japonicus (mackerel), and Lutjanus vitta (brown striped snapper). Larger fish included Oplegnathus fasciatus (striped beak-perch), Plectorhynchus pictus (painted <b>sweetlip),</b> and Prionurus microlepidotus (surgeon fish), but in limited numbers. In order to form a productive reef, it seems necessary to build a reef in one to two piles, each of a 2 - 3 peaked type, and of a maximum height...|$|E
40|$|The {{artificial}} {{breeding of}} marine fish in China {{has been developed}} {{over a period of}} more than 50 years. Both species diversity and fry production have greatly increased since the 1980 s. By the year 2000, at least 52 species belonging to 24 families of marine fish had been successfully bred. Large quantities of cultured fry can meet the needs of both sea cage culture and pond culture for most species. Fish fry production has entered a period of sustainable. development. The number of artificially produced fry of large yellow croaker (Pseudosciaena crocea) exceeded 1. 3 billion in year 2000. The species for which more than 10 million fry is produced annually through aquaculture are: red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), Japanese sea perch (Lateolabrax japonicus), redeye mullet (Liza haematocheila), cuneate drum (Nibea miichthioides), red seabream (Pagrosomus major), milkfish (Chanos chanos) and three-banded <b>sweetlip</b> (Plectorhynchus cinctus). Several millions of artificial fry are cultured annually for the following species: Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), black porgy (Sparus macrocephalus), silver sea perch (Lates calcarifer), Russell's snapper (Lutjanus russelli), javelin grunt (Pomadasys hasta), miiuy croaker (Miichthys miiuy), Chinese black sleeper (Bostrichthys sinensis) and skewband grunt (Hapalogenys nitens). Fishes belonging to the family Sciaenidae are now the major species for artificial propagation. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{the potential of}} habitat connectivity to promote the effectiveness of marine reserves. We used heterogeneous reef seascapes as a model system to examine the potential interaction of reserves and mangrove-reef connectivity and compared the magnitude of these effects across the western Pacific Ocean. Location: The tropical and subtropical western Pacific, including the Solomon Islands, Great Barrier Reef and Moreton Bay, Australia. Methods: We quantified fish densities on coral reefs (38 sites) and in mangrove forests (19 sites) across seven marine reserves and twelve unprotected control locations. Fish assemblages were in seascapes supporting either adjacent reefs and mangroves or isolated reefs. For each reserve-control comparison, we evaluated the potential interactive effects of habitat connectivity on species richness and densities of harvested species, functional groups, families and individual species. We then examined the influence of spatial variation in reserve attributes, seascape heterogeneity and latitude on the magnitude of reserve-connectivity effects. Results: Snappers (Lutjanidae) and rabbitfish (Siganidae) were more abundant on reserve reefs close to mangroves in all regions. These interactive effects also enhanced the abundance of <b>sweetlip</b> (Haemulidae), bream (Sparidae), harvested fish, herbivores and piscivores and species richness {{in two of the}} three regions examined. Spatial variation in the magnitude of reserve-connectivity effects was explained by differences among reserves in seascape variables (i. e. area of mangroves and reef, duration of mangrove inundation and distance to rivers) but not by reserve attributes (i. e. age, size, poaching) or latitude. Main conclusions: Habitat connectivity improved the effectiveness of reserves across the western Pacific Ocean. We recommend that heterogeneous landscapes with high-habitat connectivity should be viewed as high priorities for conservation. By improving our understanding of connectivity, and through its explicit incorporation into conservation, we may have greater success in restoring biodiversity and functioning of ecosystems. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|E
