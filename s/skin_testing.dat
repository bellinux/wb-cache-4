2500|$|A {{skin test}} uses an antigen {{generated}} from laboratory grown S. schenckii {{to challenge the}} patient's immune system. The antigen is intradermally injected and the test is interpreted 48 hours later. Erythema {{at the site of}} injection indicates a positive response. The major advantage of this test is its rapidity and ease of use. Although it provides results more quickly than a fungal culture, the sporotrichin skin test has some important limitations.

In addition, the term [...] "sporotrichin" [...] does not indicate a specific molecule but only any antigen derived from S. schenckii.

40|$|Background and objective: Contradictory {{reports of}} the {{sensitivity}} of <b>skin</b> <b>tests</b> in quinolone allergy have been reported.

Methods: We reviewed <b>skin</b> and challenge <b>test</b> results of all patients who consulted at our allergy service over the last 5 years because of a history of quinolone adverse reaction in the form of urticaria or anaphylaxis within 1 hour of drug intake (group 1), urticaria or maculopapular eruption between 1 and 24 hours after intake (group 2) or after 24 hours had passed (group 3), or atypical symptoms (group 4). Results: A total of 71 cases were identifi ed: 27, 8, 24 and 12 in groups 1 through 4, respectively. <b>Skin</b> <b>tests</b> were performed in all patients, with positive results in 31 patients. In group 1, 62. 9 % of these patients showed positive <b>skin</b> <b>tests</b> and 22. 2 % showed positive challenge tests, whereas in the other 3 groups, about 30 % of patients had positive <b>skin</b> <b>tests</b> and a variable percentage (from 0 % to 4. 1 % depending on the group) had positive challenge tests. Quinolone challenge tests were performed in 10 patients with positive <b>skin</b> <b>tests</b> (5 of them with positive results) and in 34 patients with negative <b>skin</b> <b>tests</b> (2 of them with positive results).

40|$|Rationale: Diagnosis of latent {{tuberculosis}} infection (LTBI) is currently {{based on the}} tuberculin <b>skin</b> <b>test.</b> The enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) is a new blood test to diagnose LTBI. Objective: To compare the ELISPOT and the tuberculin <b>skin</b> <b>test</b> for detecting LTBI in contacts of patients with tuberculosis. Methods: Prospective study of 413 contacts of patients with tuberculosis. Measurements and Main Results: Because there is no gold standard for LTBI, the sensitivity and specificity of the ELISPOT and tuberculin <b>skin</b> <b>test</b> cannot be directly measured. For each contact, we therefore estimated the likelihood of having LTBI by calculating a contact score that quantified exposure to and infectiousness of the index case. We analyzed the relationship of contact score to ELISPOT and tuberculin <b>skin</b> <b>test</b> results. The likelihood of a positive ELISPOT (p = 0. 0005) and a tuberculin <b>skin</b> <b>test</b> (p = 0. 01) increased significantly with rising contact scores. The contact score was more strongly related to the ELISPOT than to the tuberculin <b>skin</b> <b>test</b> results, although this difference was not statistically significant. Among U.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Options for {{intervention}} against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection {{are limited by}} the diagnostic tools available. The Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) <b>skin</b> <b>test</b> {{is thought to be}} non-specific, especially in tropical settings. We compared the PPD <b>skin</b> <b>test</b> with an ELISPOT test in The Gambia. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Household contacts over six months of age of sputum smear positive TB cases and community controls were recruited. They underwent a PPD <b>skin</b> <b>test</b> and an ELISPOT test for the T cell response to PPD and ESAT- 6 /CFP 10 antigens. Responsiveness to M. tuberculosis exposure was analysed according to sleeping proximity to an index case using logistic regression. 615 household contacts and 105 community controls were recruited. All three tests assessed increased significantly in positivity with increasing M. tuberculosis exposure, the PPD <b>skin</b> <b>test</b> most dramatically (OR 15. 7; 95 % CI 6. 6 - 35. 3). While the PPD <b>skin</b> <b>test</b> positivity continued to trend downwards in the community with increasing distance from a known case (61. 9 % to 14. 3 %), the PPD and ESAT- 6 /CFP- 10 ELISPOT positivity did not. The PPD <b>skin</b> <b>test</b> was more in agreement with ESAT- 6 /CFP- 10 ELISPOT (75 %, p = 0. 01) than the PPD ELISPOT (53 %, p< 0. 0001). With increasing M. tuberculosis exposure, the proportion of ESAT- 6 /CFP- 10 positive contacts who were PPD <b>skin</b> <b>test</b> positive increased (p< 0. 0001), and the proportion of ESAT- 6 /CFP- 10 negative contacts that were PPD <b>skin</b> <b>test</b> negative decreased (p< 0. 0001); the converse did not occur.
