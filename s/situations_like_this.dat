5|$|In 2003, three {{countries}} applied {{to make their}} debut: Albania, Belarus and Ukraine. In addition, Serbia and Montenegro, who had not competed since 1992, applied to return. The EBU, having originally accepted the four countries' applications, later rejected all but Ukraine; allowing four extra countries to compete would have meant relegating too many countries. The semi-final was introduced in 2004 {{in an attempt to}} prevent <b>situations</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> The Union set a limit of forty countries, but by 2005 thirty-nine were competing. In 2007, the EBU lifted the limit, allowing forty-two countries to compete. Two semi-finals were held {{for the first time in}} 2008.|$|E

25|$|While {{the vast}} {{majority}} of the ship's multinational personnel held positions that did not require a seaman's qualifications (as they handled services like laundry, cooking, entertainment, cleaning, minding children, and waiting tables), according to a senior shipping official, they had received mandatory training in basic safety to be able to help in <b>situations</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> Although all of them spoke at least basic English, most spoke no Italian.|$|E

2500|$|With his {{contract}} expiring {{at the end}} of the 2006–07 season, Celtic moved to offer Maloney a new deal. However, contract negotiations continued for months, constantly breaking down due to differences between the two parties. Chief Executive Peter Lawwell asserted that Celtic [...] "cannot keep players at any cost" [...] while Maloney warned that [...] "In <b>situations</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> one, both parties have to be completely happy with the outcome." [...] He also promised that the prolonged contract talks would not affect his football and that he hoped he would not have to consider leaving the club in the future. With the realisation that Maloney would be able to leave for free by signing a pre-contract with another club in January 2007, the Celtic support feared the worst, recalling Jackie McNamara's departure.|$|E
2500|$|Although Walt Disney {{had been}} highly {{involved}} in planning the Florida Project, Walt Disney Productions began construction on Magic Kingdom {{and the entire}} resort in 1967 after his death. The park was built as a larger, improved version of Disneyland Park in California. There are several anecdotes regarding some {{of the features of}} Walt Disney World, and Magic Kingdom specifically. According to one story, Walt Disney once saw a Frontierland cowboy walking through Tomorrowland at Disneyland. He disliked that the cowboy intruded on the futuristic setting of Tomorrowland and wanted to avoid <b>situations</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> in the new park. Therefore, Magic Kingdom was built over a series of tunnels called utilidors, a portmanteau of utility and corridor, allowing employees (called [...] "cast members") or VIP guests to move through the park out of sight from guests.|$|E

50|$|Reporting {{independence}} {{protects the}} auditors’ ability {{to choose to}} reveal to the public any information they believe should be disclosed.

50|$|If {{a company}} or {{organization}} communicates between its different branches or firms regularly, it {{will most likely}} lease a dedicated cable line to connect each of the branches together. These lines are not always reliable meaning one branch may be {{cut off from the}} rest. In <b>situations</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> having a backup connection ready is essential. Since DDR uses existing telephone lines, a DDR connection will almost always be available as a backup solution.|$|E
50|$|The {{lessons are}} 45 minutes in length, with five-minute breaks in between to allow time for {{relocating}} {{to the next}} classroom or eating and drinking, for example. Lessons are taught in German or English; this depends on the teacher entirely. Hence, situations can arise when one has a particular subject in German one year and in English the next, or vice versa.

5000|$|Catholics for Choice, an {{independent}} pro-choice organization, also expressed concerns regarding the decision. Its president, Jon O'Brien, said, [...] "While {{not all the}} facts are available, {{it is clear that}} the Vatican's hard line on abortion led to this terrible situation. Sadly, we see <b>situations</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> time after time, both here in the US and abroad.

5000|$|The {{considerate}} (relationship-oriented) {{style of}} leadership can be appropriate {{in an environment where}} the situation is moderately favorable or certain. For example, when (1) leader-member relations are good, (2) the task is structured, and (3) position power is either strong or weak. <b>Situations</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> exist with research scientists, who do not like superiors to structure the task for them. They prefer to follow their own creative leads in order to solve problems. In a situation like this a considerate {{style of leadership}} is preferred over the task-oriented.|$|E
