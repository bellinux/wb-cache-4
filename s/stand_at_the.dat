The car received an overwhelmingly positive reception by public and press, and a number of wealthy Jaguar enthusiasts handed over blank cheques to secure a purchase option should the XJ220 concept go into production.

5|$|John Buchan's brigade skirmished {{with the}} French {{defenders}} of Orthez all morning.

Joined by some newly arrived conscript battalions, Harispe attempted to make a <b>stand</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Motte de Tury heights. The raw recruits proved to be poor fighting material; Hill's men broke Harispe's line and captured three guns.|$|E
