60|$|She {{lived with}} her widowed mother in a portion of an ancient {{building}} formerly a manor-house, but now a mill, which, being too large for his own requirements, the miller had found it convenient to divide and appropriate in part to these highly respectable tenants. In this dwelling Mrs. Garland's and Anne's ears were soothed morning, noon, and night by {{the music of the}} mill, the wheels and cogs of which, being of wood, produced notes that might have borne in their minds a remote resemblance to the wooden tones of the stopped diapason in an organ. Occasionally, when the miller was bolting, there was added to these continuous sounds the cheerful clicking of the hopper, which did not deprive them of rest except when it was kept going all night; and over and above all this they had the pleasure of knowing that there crept in through every crevice, door, and window of their dwelling, however tightly closed, a subtle mist of <b>superfine</b> <b>flour</b> from the grinding room, quite invisible, but making its presence known in the course of time by giving a pallid and ghostly look to the best furniture. The miller frequently apologized to his tenants for the intrusion of this insidious dry fog; but the widow was of a friendly and thankful nature, and she said that she did not mind it at all, being as it was, not nasty dirt, but the blessed staff of life.|$|E
40|$|The American {{company that}} {{promoted}} the Internet {{in its early}} days, Sun Microsystems, conducted research into how people use the Web in 1997. It concluded simply, 'They don't. ' They sample words and phrases. The wired world doesn't promote meditation. People scan, graze, forward or download megabytes of information and store it on computers whose memories get fatter and processors faster every few monthsâ€”the large proportion of {{it is not even}} read, let alone understood. There is an ever-growing militia of information carriers, professional and amateur. They have learned to sift through information like <b>superfine</b> <b>flour,</b> to squirrel it away in gigabytes for a feast that never comes. Like Ted Nelson with his glorious barricade of filing cabinets and folders, we have become pack-rats. Archivists are everywhere, official and self-made. But, at the same time, circuit-driven communications encourage a short-term memory. On the level of software and hardware, many of the world's librarians and archivists see a crisis looming. The rate at which we churn through storage technologies is escalating. We discard six-month-old PCs. We upgrade digital networks as regularly as our finances allow it. Archives are often lost to technological obsolescence. In under forty years, we have seen magnetic core memory, cartridges, magnetic tapes, microfilm, 51 4 inch floppy disks, high-density floppy disks, optical disks and now CD-ROM succeed each other at light speed. Old storage media are quickly outdated, and the information they contain, unless it is 'refreshed' as the industry calls it, is always in danger of becoming unreadable. With paper, all you needed was your eyes. The Web is the most dramatic example of this. It is by nature a transient, evanescent medium...|$|E
