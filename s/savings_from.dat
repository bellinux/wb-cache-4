40|$|Following the 1994 {{financial}} crisis, {{the rate}} of saving of the Mexican economy fell from 21. 7 percent to 19. 8 percent of GDP.

25|$|International trade (current account) imbalances, {{resulting}} in an excess of savings over investments, increasing the volatility of capital flow among countries. For example, the flow of <b>savings</b> <b>from</b> Asia to the U.S. {{was one of the}} drivers of the 2000s housing bubble.|$|E
25|$|To expand {{access to}} capital, many of FINCA's {{subsidiaries}} have transformed into licensed, regulated, micro-deposit taking institutions (i.e. “microbanks”), {{in order to}} mobilize <b>savings</b> <b>from</b> its clients.

25|$|Cluster {{sampling}} (also {{known as}} clustered sampling) generally increases {{the variability of}} sample estimates above that of simple random sampling, {{depending on how the}} clusters differ between one another as compared to the within-cluster variation. For this reason, cluster sampling requires a larger sample than SRS to achieve the same level of accuracy – but cost <b>savings</b> <b>from</b> clustering might still make this a cheaper option.|$|E

25|$|According to the IEA 2008 {{modelling}} of cogeneration expansion for the G8 countries, {{expansion of}} cogeneration in France, Germany, Italy and the UK alone would effectively double the existing primary fuel savings by 2030. This would increase Europe's <b>savings</b> <b>from</b> today's 155 TWh to 465 TWh in 2030.

The <b>savings</b> <b>from</b> the change - estimated at $340,000 annually - were to be used to increase frequencies on the 65X route.

25|$|The formal {{crediting}} period for Joint Implementation (JI) was {{aligned with the}} first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, and did not start until January 2008 (Carbon Trust, 2009, p.20). In November 2008, only 22 JI projects had been officially approved and registered. The total projected emission <b>savings</b> <b>from</b> JI by 2012 are about one tenth that of the CDM. Russia accounts for about two-thirds of these savings, with the remainder divided up roughly equally between the Ukraine and the EU's New Member States. Emission savings include cuts in methane, HFC, and N2O emissions.|$|E
25|$|In {{the example}} of {{improved}} vehicle fuel efficiency, the direct effect would be the increased fuel use from more driving as driving becomes cheaper. The indirect effect would incorporate the increased consumption of other goods enabled by household cost <b>savings</b> <b>from</b> increased fuel efficiency. Since consumption of other goods increases, the embodied fuel used {{in the production of}} those goods would increase as well. Finally, the economy-wide effect would include the long-term effect of the increase in vehicle fuel efficiency on production and consumption possibilities throughout the economy, including any effects on economic growth rates.|$|E

25|$|The {{airframe}} followed contemporary {{aircraft construction}} techniques, with weight <b>savings</b> <b>from</b> {{the use of}} advanced materials and the short airborne life of the missile. The fuselage was essentially tubular, tapering to a point at the nose, housing the guidance equipment, warhead and systems equipment. The engine was fed with air through a distinctive wedge shaped intake under the center fuselage. Its swept wings attached to its fuselage at the middle position, roughly halfway along its length, and a large swept fin attached {{to the top of}} the fuselage at the rear which was sometimes augmented by a large ventral fin at the extreme rear of the fuselage.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{evidence}} that claims of Medigap’s tendency to cause over-treatment may be exaggerated and that potential <b>savings</b> <b>from</b> restricting it might be smaller than expected. Meanwhile, there are some concerns about the potential effects on enrollees. Individuals who face high charges with every episode of care have been shown to delay or forgo needed care, jeopardizing their health and possibly increasing their health care costs down the line. Given their lack of medical training, most patients tend to have difficulty distinguishing between necessary and unnecessary treatments. The problem could be exaggerated among the Medicare population, which has low levels of health literacy.|$|E
25|$|Administrative costs. About 25% of U.S. {{healthcare}} costs relate to administrative costs (e.g., billing and payment, {{as opposed to}} direct provision of services, supplies and medicine) versus 10-15% in other countries. For example, Duke University Hospital had 900 hospital beds but 1,300 billing clerks. Assuming $3.2 trillion is spent on healthcare per year, a 10% savings would be $320 billion per year and a 15% savings would be nearly $500 billion per year. For scale, cutting administrative costs to peer country levels would represent roughly one-third to half the gap. A 2009 study from Price Waterhouse Coopers estimated $210 billion in <b>savings</b> <b>from</b> unnecessary billing and administrative costs, a figure that would be considerably higher in 2015 dollars.|$|E
