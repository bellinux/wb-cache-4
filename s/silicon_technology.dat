25|$|In {{thin-film}} form, CdS can {{be combined}} with other layers for use in certain types of solar cells. CdS {{was also one of}} the first semiconductor materials to be used for thin-film transistors (TFTs). However interest in compound semiconductors for TFTs largely waned after the emergence of amorphous <b>silicon</b> <b>technology</b> in the late 1970s.|$|E
25|$|In general {{it is very}} {{difficult}} to assemble devices on the atomic scale, as one has to position atoms on other atoms of comparable size and stickiness. Another view, put forth by Carlo Montemagno, is that future nanosystems will be hybrids of <b>silicon</b> <b>technology</b> and biological molecular machines. Richard Smalley argued that mechanosynthesis are impossible due to the difficulties in mechanically manipulating individual molecules.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — We {{present an}} {{integrated}} wideband directional coupler for millimeter-wave applications implemented in lowcost <b>silicon</b> <b>technologies.</b> It is constructed using broad-side coupled coplanar waveguides (CPW), {{taking advantage of}} available multiple metal layers in <b>silicon</b> <b>technologies.</b> A prototype coupler was designed and fabricated using a commercial digital CMOS technology with low-resistivity epi substrate. It achieves a 10 - 40 GHz frequency range (3 -dB bandwidth) with 7 dB to 10 dB coupling and more than 10 dB directivity. Measurement results match well with electromagnetic simulation.
