50|$|Crude lanolin {{constitutes}} about 5-25%of {{the weight}} of freshly <b>shorn</b> <b>wool.</b> The wool from one Merino sheep will produce about 250-300ml of recoverable wool grease. Lanolin is extracted by washing the wool in hot water with a special wool scouring detergent to remove dirt, wool grease (crude lanolin), suint (sweat salts), and anything else stuck to the wool. The wool grease is continuously removed during this washing process by centrifuge separators, which concentrate it into a wax-like substance melting at approximately 38°C (100°F).|$|E

Four field trials used eight total groups of sheep randomised to treatment (flytrap) or control on two properties in southern Queensland between 1999 and 2001. Treatment consisted of the operation of flytraps in paddocks as per manufacturer's recommendations. All sheep were inspected physically each month for flystrikes. Flytraps were associated with a reduction in flystrike incidence of 38 – 55 %, compared to control sheep. Results confirm that traps are a useful component of a flystrike-control program.

40|$|The data used, and {{the methods}} and {{assumptions}} fundamental {{to the development of}} an equilibrium displacement model (EDM) of the Australian sheep and wool industries specified in Mounter et al. (2007), are contained in this report. The national sheep flock is disaggregated into Merino and non-Merino sheep in the three agricultural zones of Australia using 2002 - 03 Australian agricultural and grazing industries survey data. Opening and closing sheep numbers, death rates and weaning percentages were used to derive the supply and use of sheep in each zone. Annual <b>shorn</b> <b>wool</b> production was split into four fibre-diameter categories in each zone corresponding to ABS wool export categories. Wool production percentages and relative greasy fleece weights were used to estimate the quantities of wool attributable to ewes, wethers and hoggets in each zone. Estimates were also constructed of lamb, mutton and live sheep export volumes produced from the different sheep enterprises in each agricultural zone. As the flock composition data are based on 2002 - 03 figures, aggregate production and export data for 2002 - 03 were used to validate the methods involved in deriving the disaggregated production estimates. The data in the EDM of the Australian sheep and wool industries by Mounter et al. (2007) are average annual values for the years 2002 - 03 to 2004 - 05. The methods and assumptions used in specifying the data are the same as those used in obtaining the disaggregated 2002 - 03 estimates.

50|$|For small flocks, a grazier {{might do}} the work single-handedly. For large flocks and stud sheep, graziers will hire shearers, or use a {{contractor}} who provides professional shearing teams to do the required work. The grazier would decide {{on the extent of}} crutching: the rear of the sheep is almost always <b>shorn,</b> whereas <b>wool</b> around the face, ears, underside and pizzle may also be removed depending on the circumstances such as the weather, length of fleece, and amount of seed or other impurities present in the fleece and the underlying reason for crutching (preventative of fly-strike, or to reduce the likelihood of stain in the fleece wool). Super fine wool Merino flocks are often given a light crutch, known as a New England crutch that removes less of the valuable fleece.|$|R
40|$|Wool {{scouring}} is {{the first}} stage of wool processing, where unwanted contaminants are removed from freshly <b>shorn</b> <b>wool.</b> In most scouring machines wool is fed as a continuous mat through a series of water-filled scour and rinse bowls which are periodically drained. The purpose of this project is to mathematically model the scour bowl with the aim of improving efficiency. In this thesis four novel models of contaminant concentration within a scour bowl are developed. These are used to investigate the relationships between the operating parameters of the machine and the concentration of contamination within the scour bowl. The models use the advection-diffusion equation to simulate the settling and mixing of contamination. In the first model considered here, the scour bowl is simulated numerically using finite difference methods. Previous models of the scouring process only considered the average steady-state concentration of contamination within the entire scour bowl. This {{is the first}} wool scouring model to look at the bowl in two dimensions and to give time dependent results, hence allowing the effect of different drainage patterns to be studied. The second model looks at the important region {{at the top of the}} bowl - where the wool and water mix. The governing equations are solved analytically by averaging the concentration vertically assuming the wool layer is thin. Asymptotic analysis on this model reveals some of the fundamental behaviour of the system. The third model considers the same region by solving the governing equations through separation of variables. A fourth, fully two-dimensional, time dependent model was developed and solved using a finite element method. A model of the swelling of grease on the wool fibres is also considered since some grease can only be removed from the fibre once swollen. The swelling is modelled as a Stefan problem, a nonlinear diffusion equation with two moving boundaries, in cylindrical coordinates. Both approximate, analytical and a numerical solutions are found...|$|E
50|$|Modern Hebrideans have black, rather coarse wool, which fades {{to brown}} {{in the sun}} and often becomes grey with age; there is no wool on the face or legs. If not <b>shorn</b> the <b>wool</b> may moult {{naturally}} in spring. Rams and ewes typically have one pair of horns, but often have two or even more pairs (polycerate), and occasionally none. They are considerably smaller than most other breeds of sheep, fully grown ewes weighing only around 40 kg, and rams slightly heavier, at around 50 to 60 kg. It has been reported that the muscle tissue and fats of the Hebridean have significantly less cholesterol than other well known breeds.Hebrideans are hardy and able to thrive on rough grazing, and so are often used as conservation grazing animals to maintain natural grassland or heathland habitats. They are particularly effective at scrub control, having a strong preference for browsing.|$|R

40|$|Since 1994 wild vicuñas {{have been}} {{captured}} and <b>shorn</b> for their <b>wool,</b> yet, {{there remains a}} noticeable lack of data regarding the possible influence of capture and shearing upon vicuña biology. Therefore, we assessed post-capture group composition, genetic relatedness, and paternity among animals that were captured for live shearing and release. We captured twenty-six groups (134 animals) on the Chilean Altiplano. Seventy-three percent of Male Groups (designated prior to chase) contained exclusively adult males upon capture, whereas remaining “Male Groups” contained crias and/or adult females and crias. Forty-seven percent of Family Groups (designated prior to chase) contained 1 adult male, adult females, {{and the number of}} crias ≤ the number of adult females. Remaining Family Groups contained no or multiple adult males, and more crias than adult females. Average relatedness among all vicuñas was − 0. 007. Paternity analysis revealed that 35 % of crias were captured with their biological mother and that only 1 cria was captured with both biological parents. Based on previous observations of group composition in the wild, animals from different groups may separate and/or mix during the chasing stage. Improvement of the chasing technique and instituting a post-capture monitoring program may aid in the detection of medium- and long-term impacts regarding group stability, cria survival, and ultimately wool production...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} ectoparasiticides are used on sheep {{to protect the}} animals from ill health {{associated}} with infestations of lice {{and the effects of}} fly-strike. Most of the compounds currently in use are organophosphate or pyrethroid-based and have been used for 15 - 20 years, or more. In more recent times, as with other pest control strategies, there has been a tendency to introduce 'newer' pesticides, principally in the form of insect growth regulators (IGRs). Vetrazin® was the first IGR-based compound to be registered for use as an ectoparasiticide in Australia and New Zealand. The active ingredient of Vetrazin® is cyromazine, a triazine-based compound. Prior to the introduction of Vetrazin®, and indeed more recently with other 'new' pesticides, little was, or is known regarding the fate of these compounds during woolscouring. Additionally, given the present practice for woolscours to discharge their aqueous effluents to the aquatic environment, little was, or is known regarding their effects on these receiving waters. In addition, cyromazine is a chemically 'unique' compound, apparently possessing chemical and environmental stability, as well as being highly polar. This uniqueness required the development of specialised techniques for its analysis. Its environmental stability and polarity also suggested that it could become a significant aquatic contaminant, certainly in localised situations. This thesis outlines the development of a clean-up method for the analysis of cyromazine residues in woolscouring waste waters and on greasy (<b>shorn)</b> and scoured <b>wool.</b> A clean-up method using Extract-Clean™ ion-exchange cartridges and analysis by both gas chromatography with nitorgenphosphorus detector (GC/NPD) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is described. The fate of cyromazine residues during the scouring of greasy wool was investigated by both laboratory and industrial pilot plant trials. Cyromazine was shown to be readily removed in the first three scouring bowls of a woolscour. A simple model is described {{that can be used to}} predict cyromazine effluent concentrations based on a known content for greasy wool. These effluent concentrations can then be used to assess compliance with a proposed environmental quality standard (EQS) established for cyromazine, based on aquatic bioassays. Aquatic bioassays were conducted with both Chironomus zealandicus (Diptera: Chironomidae) larvae and eggs and Deleatidium sp. (Ephemeroptera: Leptophlebiidae) nymphs. Cyromazine possessed negligible acute toxicity to both organisms, with the concentration required for 50 % mortality (LC 50) being greater than 100 mg/l. However, significant chronic toxicity to C. zealandicus was observed, with a lowest observable effect concentration (LOEC) of 25 µg/l being recorded. A proposed environmental quality standard (EQS) value of 1. 0 µg/l has been suggested, a figure supported by limited aquatic toxicity studies performed elsewhere. Cyromazine was shown to dominate approximately 30 % of the fly-strike control market in New Zealand. This high usage, plus a moderate EQS value, suggests that a minimum seven week withholding period be instigated between dipping for fly-strike control and shearing of treated sheep. Limited toxicity testing was carried out on another IGR-based ectoparasiticide, Zenith®, containing diflubenzuron. This testing, combined with published aquatic toxicity data, suggests than an EQS value for this compound be set at 0. 01 µg/l and a withholding period for dipped sheep be set at 18 weeks. Such a long withholding period is unlikely to be attainable in practice such that, if highly aquatically toxic compounds are going to be used as ectoparasiticides on sheep, then woolscours are going to have to invest in technology to remove pesticides from their effluents...|$|R
