The probe has optical fibers and beam splitters (1) {{as well as a}} <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> to divide the light, coming from the external <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> into multiple rays <b>of</b> <b>light</b> and to lead these into the channels. A <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> is integrated in each channel. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for optical detection of ultrasonic waves by {{ultrasonic probe}}, involves reflecting of ultrasonic waves, sent by an ultrasonic signal generator, are reflected to an article or body, and the reflected ultrasonic waves are registered by multiple optical detection units. USE - Ultrasonic probe for the optical detection of the ultrasonic waves reflected on an object or a body (Claimed). ADVANTAGE - A <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> is integrated in each channel, and thus enables to reduce the cost, power consumption and size of the system.

40|$|Aim of the study: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} characteristics of the LED lamps and their influence on perceptual abilities and feeling of a human. Materials and methods: Technical parameters of ten chosen LED <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> were determined. The sources varied among each other, according to the shape, colour temperature, colour rendering index and also name of the manufacturer. For each <b>of</b> the analysed <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> the illuminance, lighting uniformity, lighting luminance and degree of glare were determined. Moreover, also a subjective evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>lighting</b> conditions created by those lighting sources was performed. Results and conclusions: The study results have shown that the majority <b>of</b> the analysed <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> provided their users with a good visibility and comfort of vision, but on the other hand, if used in an inappropriate way, they may be the reason for the unaccepted glare. It has been stated that the appropriate use and earlier â€“ the well-thought-out choice <b>of</b> the LED <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> are crucial. One has to consider the luminous flux, the colour temperature, the shape, as well as the manufacturer, who guarantees the quality and the safety class <b>of</b> the LED <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>light...</b>|$|R
