40|$|The {{stability}} of the financial system is associated with systemic risk {{factors such as the}} concurrent default of numerous small obligors. Hence it is of utmost importance to study the mutual dependence of losses for different creditors in the case of large, overlapping credit portfolios. We analytically calculate the multivariate joint loss distribution of several credit portfolios on a non-stationary market. To take fluctuating asset correlations into account we use an random matrix approach which preserves, as a much appreciated side effect, analytical tractability and drastically reduces the number of parameters. We show that for two disjoint credit portfolios diversification does not work in a correlated market. Additionally we find large concurrent portfolio losses to be rather likely. We show that significant correlations of the losses emerge not only for large portfolios with thousands of credit contracts but also for small portfolios consisting of a few credit contracts only. Furthermore we include subordination levels, which were established in collateralized debt obligations to protect the more senior tranches from high losses. We analytically corroborate the observation that an extreme loss of the <b>subordinated</b> <b>creditor</b> is likely to also yield a large loss of the senior creditor.

In contrast to neoclassical and even Keynesian {{theories of the}} interest rate as primarily a price for money, Pilkington argues that the interest rate at the most basic level {{is determined by the}} relative social powers of creditors and debtors. This relationship is mediated by historically contingent legal and economic institutions, like the central banks, which <b>subordinate</b> <b>creditor</b> power to the whims of governments, courts and technocrats. It is only based on these fundamentally-determined interest rates that the price mechanism comes into play.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{tractable}} framework {{to assess the}} systemic implications of bail-in. To this end, we construct a multi-layered network model where each layer represents the securities cross holdings of a specific seniority among the largest euro area banking groups. On this basis, the bail-in of a bank can be simulated to identify the direct contagion risk to the other banks in the network. We find {{that there is no}} direct contagion to creditor banks. Spill-overs also tend to be small due to low levels of securities cross-holdings in the interbank network. We also quantify the impact of a bail-in on the different liability holders. In the baseline scenario, shareholders and <b>subordinated</b> <b>creditors</b> are always affected by the bail-in, senior unsecured creditors in 75 % of the cases. Finally, we compute the effect of the bail-in on the network topology in each layer. We find that a bail-in significantly reshapes interbank linkages within specific seniority layers...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} effect a strict foreclosure, the {{creditor}} must transmit a proposal indicating their desire to foreclose, which must {{be sent to the}} debtor and to secondary obligors (guarantors of the debt). If the collateral is not consumer goods, the notice must also be sent to other secured parties known to the foreclosing creditor, either because they have notified the foreclosing creditor of their interest, or because they have perfected their interest by filing the appropriate documents with the state secretary of state. If any notified party objects within 20 days, irrespective of reason, then strict foreclosure will not be permitted. Instead, the creditor will have to sell the property in a commercially reasonable manner, and will recoup its debt from the proceeds of that sale. This prevents <b>subordinated</b> <b>creditors</b> from having their interest {{in the value of the}} property cut off, since any amount recovered in the sale over and above the amount of the foreclosing creditor's debt will go to the remaining creditors.|$|R

40|$|Ad ri an Po p∗ [...] Preliminary & {{incomplete}} draft [...] Abstract: A st raightforward {{method to}} enhance market disc ipline in banking is the mandatory Sub-Debt Policy (SDP), i. e. a requirement by which some large banks {{are forced to}} regularly issue a certain minimum amount of subordinated and non-guaranteed debt. If the decision of issuing sub-debt is endogenous and/or <b>subordinated</b> <b>creditors</b> are really able to influence bank managers’ behavior, {{we should be able}} to detect empirically a positive correlation between the amount of sub-debt held in bank balance sheets and banking performance. By conducting statistical tests on a panel dataset comprising the largest European banks, we find that: (i) the sub-debt issues are made generally by the most profitable banking organizations; (ii) voluntary sub-debt issues allow banks to reduce their Tier 1 ratios, while improving their overall capitalization (Tier 1 + Tier 2 ratios); (iii) as far as the risk profile is concerned, the amount of sub-debt held in bank balance sheet is negatively correlated with the quality of credit portfolio, but positively correlated with the ratio of loan loss reserve to total (gross) loans. These results arouse several reflections about the virtues and limitations of market discipline in banking in the absence of a formal SDP...|$|R
40|$|Mandatory Sub-Debt Policy as an {{alternative}} to the Third Pillar of Basel II : Is it feasible ?, by Adrian PopThe recent proposals of reform put forward by the Bank for International Settlements and the Federal Reserve System include specific elements of market discipline that are naturally added to the traditional tools of banking regulation and supervision. More precisely, a mandatory Sub-Debt Policy by which certain large and sophisticated banking organizations are forced to issue some minimum amount of subordinated debt on a regular basis, can prove itself effective in mitigating moral hazard and regulatory forbearance in banking industry. In this article, we provide some interesting and useful insights into the incentives structure of sub-debt holders by using a standard framework for option pricing applied to the banking firm. In particular, under `normal' conditions of bank solvability the <b>subordinated</b> <b>creditors</b> act indeed as natural `allies' of regulators, mitigating the risk taking incentives of bank shareholders. On the contrary, as the bank approaches its default point, they may exacerbate the moral hazard problems and complicate the tasks of supervisory authorities. In this second case, the sub-debt holders behave in fact as `enemies' of the government supervisor. Finally, we derive some major policy implications in terms of market discipline and optimal bank regulation design.

5000|$|There are {{a number}} of exceptions, which differ {{according}} to the law of each state, to the principle of limited liability. First, at the very least, as is recognized in public international law, courts will [...] "pierce the corporate veil" [...] if a corporation is being used evade obligations in a dishonest manner. Defective organization, such as a failure to duly file the articles of incorporation with a state official, is another universally acknowledged ground. However, there is considerable diversity in state law, and controversy, over how much further the law ought to go. In Kinney Shoe Corp v Polan the Fourth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals held that it would also pierce the veil if (1) the corporation had been inadequately capitalized to meet its future obligations (2) if no corporate formalities (e.g. meetings and minutes) had been observed, or (3) the corporation was deliberately used to benefit an associated corporation. However, a subsequent opinion of the same court emphasized that piercing could not take place merely to prevent an abstract notion of [...] "unfairness" [...] or [...] "injustice". A further, though technically different, equitable remedy is that according to the US Supreme Court in Taylor v Standard Gas Co corporate insiders (e.g. directors or major shareholders) who are also creditors of a company are <b>subordinated</b> to other <b>creditors</b> when the company goes bankrupt if the company is inadequately capitalized for the operations it was undertaking.|$|R
40|$|Subordination {{agreements}} among creditors {{are common}} in financial transactions. When a company seeks additional credit, the new lender may insist on an agreement with existing creditors which provides that their right to payment will be subordinated to the full payment of the new loan. The existing creditors {{may be willing to}} sign such an agreement for the purpose of encouraging the new lender to provide the borrower with liquidity needed to continue the business as a profitable venture, thereby increasing the likelihood that the borrower will meet all future financial obligations. In addition, contractual subordination is used frequently in connection with the issuance of debt securities. The level of priority of the debt securities, whether senior or junior, will directly affect their interest rate and market price. In general, contractual subordination will be respected in the event the borrower becomes a debtor in a bankruptcy case. Section 510 (a) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that “[a] subordination agreement is enforceable in a case under this title to the same extent that such agreement is enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law. ” Unless a bankruptcy court rearranges priorities based on equitable principles, known as equitable subordination, or the class of senior creditors effectively waives the benefits of the subordination agreement by voting to accept a chapter 11 plan in which they give up their rights to junior creditors, the subordination agreement controls the ranking of prebankruptcy claims against the bankruptcy estate. In addition to using subordination agreements to achieve priority over other creditors with respect to the payment of their claims, senior creditors also use them to obtain other rights from junior creditors. In particular, subordination agreements have included provisions that give the senior creditor the right to cast the junior creditor 2 ̆ 7 s vote to either accept or reject a plan of reorganization in the event the borrower is in chapter 11. These provisions effectively give a senior creditor two votes; it may vote with respect to its own claim and may vote again with respect to the <b>subordinated</b> claim. Senior <b>creditors</b> have argued that these provisions should be enforceable as a matter of contract, but junior creditors, wishing to vote on a chapter 11 plan despite the contractual provision, have argued that the enforcement of these provisions would be inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code granting voting rights only to the holders of claims. This article will examine how courts have dealt with these voting rights provisions found in subordination agreements...|$|R
