40|$|Silk {{patterns}} are {{works of art}} that resembles the valuable and unique ethnic culture that is most important to the community. The history and development of silk patterns {{in the province of}} Khon Kaen can be divided into 2 periods, before and after the year 1976. During these periods there were many changes in the manufacturing of silk textiles. The origin of classical silk patterns came from direct modeling of plants, animals and nature. Contemporary silk {{patterns are}} modeled after mediums such as television, multimedia, publications and from client requests. The manufacturing tools have also been greatly improved from wooden tools to tools made from metals and tools reinforce with steel. Electric motors have also been utilized in increasing the efficiency in the transformation of silk such as in process of dyeing and <b>spooling</b> <b>silk</b> threads. Traditional materials in silk textile production utilized traditional home grown and produced silk threads while in modern times, the silk comes from factories and purchased in <b>spools.</b> Locally produced <b>silk</b> threads are still produced but in lesser quantity because natural pigments and threads are limited in color. Modern silk threads produced from factories come in many colors and sizes to choose from. Traditional designs and patterns of silk textiles had to b...|$|R
50|$|Real Zari is {{made from}} fine silver or gold thread is drawn from silver or gold alloys, which is {{flattened}} by passing it under through equal pressure rotating rollers. The flattened silver threads are wound on the base yarn that is usually made of <b>silk.</b> These <b>spools</b> with <b>silk</b> and silver threads are further flattened for electroplating. The threads are then plated with gold {{by the process of}} electroplating. The lustre of the gilded threads is further increased by passing them through a brightener. These threads are then wound on a reel.|$|R
6000|$|She {{saw herself}} {{go into a}} {{department}} store and buy five <b>spools</b> of <b>silk</b> thread and three yards of gingham to make an apron for the cook. [...] "Shall I charge it, ma'am?" [...] asked the clerk. As she walked out a lady whom she met greeted her cordially. [...] "Oh, {{where did you get}} the pattern for those sleeves, dear Mrs. Conant?" [...] she said. At the corner a policeman helped her across the street and touched his helmet. [...] "Any callers?" [...] she asked the maid when she reached home. [...] "Mrs. Waldron," [...] answered the maid, [...] "and the two Misses Jenkinson." [...] "Very well," [...] she said. [...] "You may bring me a cup of tea, Maggie." ...|$|R
25|$|Mining {{operations}} were also opened in Charlemont {{during this period}} and included the Massachusetts Talc Company {{in the village of}} Zoar. The merchants of Charlemont Center benefited greatly from this prospecting craze. Two shops opened in the early 1890s, which were important to the Town's economy for a number of years. In 1891, W.M. Pratt established a rake handle factory and the following year, H.H. Frary opened a carriage shop, which also produced wooden <b>spools</b> for the <b>silk</b> mills in Northampton.|$|R
6000|$|Miller then unreeled a <b>spool</b> of <b>silk</b> twist, {{and this}} I tied {{squarely}} to {{the arm of}} the chair at a point about six feet from the loose end which I intended to hold. I knotted the silk about the psychic's wrists, drawing it to a hard knot each time, and gave the spool to Miller, while retaining the loose end of the thread in my own hands. The psychic could neither touch the tips of her fingers together nor lift her arms an inch from the chair. She was as secure as if bound with a rope, but as an extra precaution I passed the thread beneath the chair-arm and pulled it taut. [...] "This will enable us to feel the lightest movement of her hands," [...] I said to Miller, who had copied my device. [...] "Are you satisfied with the conditions?" ...|$|R
60|$|Beneath {{the gaze}} of the smiling company, I took from my pocket a <b>spool</b> of strong <b>silk</b> twist, and {{proceeded}} to fasten the psychic's wrists. Each arm was tied separately in such wise that she was unable to bring her hands together, and could not raise her wrists an inch from the chair. Next, with the aid of Mrs. Cameron, I looped a long piece of tape about Mrs. Smiley's ankles, knotted it to the rungs of the chair at the back, and nailed the loose ends to the floor. I then drew chalk marks on the floor about the chair legs, in order that any movement of the chair, no matter how slight, might show. Finally, I pushed the table about two feet away from the psychic's utmost reach.|$|R
5000|$|Song Yingxing {{opened his}} chapter on {{clothing}} with {{the aspects of}} sericulture in producing silk. He gave an accurate description of the raising of silkworms, along with their instinctual mating tradition. Those raising the silkworms had their eggs deposited on sheets of paper or cloth, and stored {{for use in the}} following year. He wrote that in some regions a bathing process was used on these sheets, employing rain water, lime water, or brine, and gave specifications on the timing for this during winter, in the 12th month of the year. The reason for this, he said, was so that the inferior eggs would die in the process, hence less mulberry leaves would be consumed needlessly. He also provided specifications on how to avoid damaging the eggs in the long process of preparation before the bathing process in the 12th month. He noted the differences between two general forms of silkworms, late and early, while providing information on a wide variety in different silkworm breeds and cocoons, and even silkworm diseases. After their eventful hatching, he described the proper living conditions and environment that the silkworms should be immersed in, as well as the care that should be given in feeding them. He warned of different sources of foul odors and smoke that had the capability of killing the silkworms if they came into contact. He described the spinning of cocoons, gathering of cocoons, sorting of cocoons, and the different pests such as birds and mosquitoes that should be avoided, He also described the proper planting of mulberry trees and how to harvest them. For the process of making silk, he noted that raw silk could not be reeled into normal silk until a formal wadding process was done. He described the reeling of silk fabric with a reeling machine, the <b>spooling</b> of <b>silk</b> fibers, the spinning of silk fibers into weft yarns, the silken threads drawn into a warp frame for weaving, and the [...] "ingenious" [...] works of figure designing. He also described the proper dimensions of different draw looms, ...|$|R
