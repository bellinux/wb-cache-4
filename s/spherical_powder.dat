For increasing porosity range, space holder was used. <b>Spherical</b> <b>powder</b> foams were cold compacted at (200, 300, 400, 500 MPa) compaction pressures and then sintered at 1200 °C for 2 h and 1300 °C for 2 - 4 - 6 h. The final porosities and average pore sizes were determined as {{functions of the}} applied compaction pressure and sintered time. The mean pore size of the foams varied between 94 and 148 mm depending on the particle size range of the powders used and the compaction pressure applied. Microscopic studies of sintered powder foams showed that sintering at high temperature (1200 °C and 1300 °C) and subsequent relatively slow-rate cooling in the furnace transformed the microstructure of <b>spherical</b> <b>powder</b> from the acicular alpha to the Widmansttten microstructure.

40|$|Concentration of {{acid whey}} {{followed}} by spray drying is severely obstructed due to presence of lactic acid (LA) and calcium (Ca).

The present {{study examined the}} effects of the presence of LA, Ca and their mixtures on the physio-chemical and thermal properties of spray dried lactose powders. Spray drying of pure lactose achieved a yield of ∼ 81 %, which was significantly reduced in the presence of high concentrations of LA (1 % w/w) or Ca (0. 12 % w/w) yielding only ∼ 52 %. Powder particles increased in size giving a D[4, 3] of 956 μm, with SEM images confirming the presence of linked strands instead of well separated <b>spherical</b> <b>powder</b> particles as observed for pure lactose. The yield of crystalline lactose increased with subsequent decrease in Ca concentration (∼ 81 %) resulting in well separated <b>spherical</b> <b>powder</b> particles. FTIR analysis suggested that water molecules in the hydration layer of lactose and the structural changes of the lactose molecules at the molecular level appeared to play major roles governing the thermal anomeric characteristics of the spray dried lactose powders in the presence of both LA and Ca. Formation of calcium lactate, which apparently restricted the diffusion of lactose molecules, partly played a role in changing the anomeric properties of the spray dried lactose powders, once the appropriate stoichiometry was reached.
