In particular, Morton collaborated extensively with artists Jane Veeder, Dan Sandin, Tom DeFanti and Jamie Fenton. In 1973, Morton asked Dan Sandin {{if he could}} build the first copy of Sandin's original Sandin Image Processor. Sandin and Morton then began {{to work together to}} create the <b>schematic</b> <b>plans</b> for the Sandin Image Processor, a document they called the Distribution Religion. Through The Distribution Religion, Sandin open sourced his Sandin Image Processor, giving the plans away for only the cost of making Xerox copies and mailing them while incorporating any additions or modifications made by those who built their own Sandin Image Processor into any further releases of the Distribution Religion.|$|R

The effects of using cognitively based <b>schematic</b> <b>planning</b> organizers at the pre-writing stage were evaluated using subjects from the Primary, Junior and Intermediate divisions. Results {{indicate that the}} use of organizers based on problem solving significantly improved the organization and the overall quality of narrative writing for students in grades 3, 6 and 7. The magnitude of the improvement of the treatment group over the control group performance in Organization ranged from 10. 7 % to 22. 9 %. Statistical and observational data indicate many implications for further research into the cognitive basis for writing and reading; for the improvement and evaluation of school writing programs; for the design of school curricula; and for the inservice education for teachers of writing...|$|R

50|$|Influenced by such leading {{figures as}} Liebig and Dumas, by 1856 Wurtz became a {{powerful}} advocate of a reform in chemical theory then {{being led by}} Charles Gerhardt and Alexander Williamson. This new chemistry of the 1850s took the idea of chemical atoms seriously, adopted atomic weights for the elements that strongly resemble the modern ones, and proposed a unitary <b>schematic</b> <b>plan</b> that opposed the dualistic theory derived {{from the work of}} Jons Jacob Berzelius. Soon thereafter, Wurtz also adopted the new structural theory that was developing from the work of younger chemists such as August Kekulé. However, a kind of skeptical positivism was influential in France {{during the second half of}} the nineteenth century, and Wurtz's efforts to gain a favorable hearing for atomism and structuralism in his homeland were largely frustrated.|$|E
40|$|Agents {{must be able}} to {{effectively}} employ teamwork, coordination, navigation, and planning to succeed in multi-agents virtual environments. These high-level abilities depend on reliable navigation and perception of the environment. We present cognitively plausible agents used for training in virtual simulations of Military Operations on Urban Terrain (MOUT). These cognitive agents are developed using the ACT-R cognitive architecture, an architecture used to model human performance {{in a wide variety of}} psychological experiments. These agents use their real-time perceptions to shape their interactions with other agents and human players on both the friendly and opposing sides of the conflict. Planning is accomplished on-line by combining <b>schematic</b> <b>plans</b> with the current context, resulting in flexible and appropriate action. Roles within plans are negotiated between agents on an as-needed basis while plans are selected based on the availability of other agents...|$|R
50|$|The city {{administration}} of Guthrie, Kentucky partnered with the University of Kentucky's College of Design {{to reform the}} urban plan {{for the city of}} Guthrie. In 2006, the city petitioned the University of Kentucky for help in developing a new plan {{for the future of the}} community. The College of Design accepted the project. The first project, known as the Guthrie Transportation Museum, became the hub project of the renewal effort. In December 2007, Matthew Colin Bailey, along with assistance from the College of Design, created <b>schematic</b> <b>plans</b> to revive the city. The city received multiple grants in amounts of over $1.4 million from the Commonwealth of Kentucky to begin the restoration of the downtown area and a branding campaign to improve the city's image. In 2009, the award-winning architecture firm of Deleon + Primmer was awarded the final design of the project.|$|R

The DMA wants the <b>schematic</b> <b>plans</b> for an Amazonian Purple Ray, wishing to deploy the device for their own uses. Diana refuses their demand. Led by the newly resurrected Hippolyta and her adviser Circe, the Amazons are joined by mythical creatures such as chimeras, winged horses, hydras and several cyclopes. The Amazon forces waste no time in murdering every male in sight, both adult and child, {{regardless of whether or}} not they are armed. Hippolyta is bent on destroying Man's World once and for all and emphasizes this point by slicing the head off of Lincoln's statue at the Lincoln Memorial. Two Amazons enter the White House and attempt to assassinate the President of the United States, but are stopped by Black Lightning.|$|R

40|$|Motivation and Area of Application. For {{documentation}} of communication networks like telephon networks normaly {{there are two}} different representations: a ground plan showing the exact coordinates of all net elements (man holes, trenches, cables cabinets, exchanges, [...] .), usually stored and managed in a GIS system, and a <b>schematic</b> <b>plan</b> containing the same information, but drawn in a schematic way, not properly scaled, but in an easier to understand way. Another kind of schematic maps are often used to display connections in a urban public transportation system: the arrangement of train stations shows some similiarity to geographic coordinates, but the main importance is to show an easy to understand drawing of the connection possibilities by using a more orthogonal drawing. In the telecomunication GIS systems it is possible to handle both views of the net: the ground plan, and a <b>schematic</b> <b>plan.</b> However, this implies a high burdon on keeping both plans consistent up to date. Every time a connection is inserted, updated or deleted in the ground plan it has to be re-done in the schematic map, too. Therefore, updateing both plans is a very tedious task and very prone to errors. This burdon is resolved by an automatic schematic map generation algorithm described in this paper. Instead of updating two different views in lockstep, only one map, the ground plan, is updated manually. The schematic map then is generated automaticly by SCHEMAP...|$|E

40|$|Robotic {{soccer is}} a way of putting {{different}} developments in intelligent agents into practice, including not only problems such as multi-agent planning and coordination, but also physical problems related to vision and communication subsystems. In this work, we present the design used as the basis for a multi-agent system, implemented for controlling a team of robots, having as main goal to facilitate the testing of new theories developed on reasoning, knowledge repre-sentation, planning, agent communication, among others Artificial Intelligence techniques. The implementation of the system was carried out following a three-layer architecture which consists of a reactive layer, an executive layer and a deliberative layer, each of which is associated with a different level of abstraction. This layered design allows to construct a functional system with basic services that can be tested and refined progressively. We will focus our explanation on the executive layer, responsible for sensorial processing and the execution of <b>schematic</b> <b>plans.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Ever since Wittkower {{published}} Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism in 1949, {{in which}} he showed that Palladio's villa plans {{are based on a}} tartan grid, it seemed that Palladio's design principles had been encapsulated. When subsequently, in 1978, Mitchell and Stiny enunciated all the topological possibilities for Palladian villa plans, it appeared that the case was closed. Freedman and Hersey have since shown that it is precisely in the application of specific building dimensions and proportions that additional design rules come into play, however. The present study builds on the work of Freedman and Hersey. It uses and extends their method which involves incorporation of the known design principles for Palladian villas, as given implicitly in Palladio's Four Books of Architecture and in his built works, into a computer program capable of generating <b>schematic</b> <b>plans</b> and elevations based on those principles and visually comparing the generated plans and elevations with the known works of Palladio. In cases of disagreement, the reasons for the disagreement help formulate further design rules...|$|R
40|$|The {{execution}} of a plan containing conditionals by an agent with incomplete knowledge poses some difficult problems. In order for the conditional to be meaningful, the agent must {{know whether or not}} the condition is true at execution time. This paper proposes one solution to this problem by integrating sensing actions into GOLOG, a high-level robot programming language. At run time, the interpreter performs a small amount of planning to ensure that the agent will know whether or not a condition is true prior {{to the point where the}} test for the truth of the condition needs to be made. Introduction Artificial agents, be they robots or software agents, need to be designed to achieve their goals in a world about which the agents have incomplete knowledge. Our approach to the design of such agents is to develop a high level language, called GOLOG (Levesque et al. 1996; Lesp'erance et al. 1995; 1994), to specify such agents. Programs written in GOLOG can be seen as <b>schematic</b> <b>plans</b> with the [...] ...|$|R
