5|$|In 2005, Mayr and Peters {{described}} {{the anatomy of}} a very well preserved specimen of Archaeopteryx, and determined that its anatomy was more like non-avian theropods than previously understood. Specifically, they found that Archaeopteryx had a primitive palatine, unreversed hallux, and hyper-extendable <b>second</b> <b>toe.</b> Their phylogenetic analysis produced the controversial result that Confuciusornis was closer to Microraptor than to Archaeopteryx, making the Avialae a paraphyletic taxon. They also suggested that the ancestral paravian was able to fly or glide, and that the dromaeosaurids and troodontids were secondarily flightless (or had {{lost the ability to}} glide). Corfe and Butler criticized this work on methodological grounds.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Cau et al. reconsidered {{the ecology}} of Balaur again in their reevaluation of its phylogenetic position, arguing that if Balaur was an avialan, it would be phylogenetically {{bracketed}} by taxa {{known to have been}} herbivorous, such as Sapeornis and Jeholornis. This suggests a non-hypercarnivorous lifestyle to be a more parsimonious conclusion and supports Cau's initial interpretations of its specializations. This is also indicated by the reduced third finger, the lack of a gynglymoid lower articulation of the second metatarsal and the rather small and moderately recurved <b>second</b> <b>toe</b> claw. Balaur had a broad pelvis, a broad foot, a large first toe, and broad lower ends of the metatarsals relative to the articulation surfaces; such a combination can in the remainder of the Theropoda only be found with the herbivorous Therizinosauridae.|$|E
5000|$|The Ancient Greeks and Romans wore {{versions}} of flip-flops as well. In Greek sandals, the toe strap was worn {{between the first}} and <b>second</b> <b>toes,</b> while Roman sandals had the strap between the <b>second</b> and third <b>toes.</b> These differ from the sandals worn by the Mesopotamians, with the strap between the third and fourth toes. In India, a related chappal ("toe knob") sandal was common, with no straps but a small knob sitting {{between the first and}} <b>second</b> <b>toes.</b> They are known as Padukas ...|$|R

50|$|The first dorsal {{metatarsal}} artery {{is a small}} artery on {{the back}} of the foot. It runs forward on the first interosseous dorsalis muscle, and at the cleft between the great and <b>second</b> <b>toes</b> divides into two branches, one of which passes beneath the tendon of the extensor hallucis longus muscle, and is distributed to the medial border of the great toe; the other bifurcates to supply the adjoining sides of the great and <b>second</b> <b>toes.</b>|$|R
5|$|Slow lorises have a {{powerful}} grasp with both their hands and feet due to several specializations. They can tightly grasp branches with little effort because of a special muscular arrangement in their hands and feet, where the thumb diverges at nearly 180° {{from the rest of}} the fingers, while the hallux (big toe) ranges between being perpendicular and pointing slightly backwards. The toes have a large flexor muscle that originates on the lower end of the thigh bone, which helps to impart a strong grasping ability to the hind limbs. The second digit of the hand is short compared to the other digits, while on the foot, the fourth toe is the longest. The sturdy thumb helps to act like a clamp when digits three, four, and five grasp the opposite side of a tree branch. This gives their hands and feet a pincer-like appearance. The strong grip can be held for hours without losing sensation due to the presence of a rete mirabile (network of capillaries), a trait shared among all lorises. Both slender and slow lorises have relatively short feet. Like nearly all lemuriforms, they have a grooming claw on the <b>second</b> <b>toe</b> of each foot.|$|E
5|$|Strepsirrhines {{are defined}} by their wet nose or rhinarium. They also have a smaller brain than comparably sized simians, large {{olfactory}} lobes for smell, a vomeronasal organ to detect pheromones, and a bicornuate uterus with an epitheliochorial placenta. Their eyes contain a reflective layer to improve their night vision, and their eye sockets include a ring of bone around the eye, but they lack a wall of thin bone behind it. Strepsirrhine primates produce their own vitamin C, whereas haplorhine primates must obtain it from their diets. Lemuriform primates are characterized by a toothcomb, a specialized set of teeth in the front, {{lower part of the}} mouth mostly used for combing fur during grooming. Often, the toothcomb is incorrectly used to characterize all strepsirrhines. Instead, it is unique to lemuriforms and is not seen among adapiforms. Lemuriforms groom orally, and also possess a grooming claw on the <b>second</b> <b>toe</b> of each foot for scratching in areas that are inaccessible to the mouth and tongue. It is unclear whether adapiforms possessed grooming claws.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinctive}} dromaeosaurid {{body plan}} helped to rekindle theories {{that at least}} some dinosaurs may have been active, fast, and closely related to birds. Robert Bakker's illustration for John Ostrom's 1969 monograph, showing the dromaeosaurid Deinonychus in a fast run, is among the most influential paleontological reconstructions in history. The dromaeosaurid body plan includes a relatively large skull, serrated teeth, narrow snout, and forward-facing eyes which indicate some degree of binocular vision. Dromaeosaurids, like most other theropods, had a moderately long S-curved neck, and their trunk was relatively short and deep. Like other maniraptorans, they had long arms that could be folded against the body in some species, and relatively large hands with three long fingers (the middle finger being the longest and the first finger being the shortest) ending in large claws. The dromaeosaurid hip structure featured a characteristically large pubic boot projecting beneath the base of the tail. Dromaeosaurid feet bore a large, recurved claw on the <b>second</b> <b>toe.</b> Their tails were slender, with long, low, vertebrae lacking transverse process and neural spines after the 14th caudal vertebra.|$|E
5000|$|... The medial {{terminal}} branch (internal branch) divides {{into two}} dorsal digital nerves (nn. digitales dorsales hallucis lateralis et digiti secundi medialis) which supply the adjacent {{sides of the}} great and <b>second</b> <b>toes,</b> ...|$|R
30|$|At late {{follow-up}} (FU), 47.2 % {{of patients}} have a bunion deformity, and 36.1 % have overriding {{of the first}} and <b>second</b> <b>toes.</b> These results parallel the 72.2 % recurrence of hallux valgus deformity.|$|R
50|$|In LFS, {{specific}} features identified as marfanoid include: a long, narrow face; tall, thin stature; long, slender limbs, {{fingers and toes}} (not unlike arachnodactyly) with joint hyperextensibility, shortened halluces (the big <b>toes)</b> and long <b>second</b> <b>toes.</b>|$|R
5|$|The low foot {{to lower}} leg ratio in Deinonychus is due partly to an unusually short {{metatarsus}} (upper foot bones). The ratio is actually larger in smaller individuals than in larger ones. Ostrom {{suggested that the}} short metatarsus {{may be related to}} the function of the sickle claw, and used the fact that it appears to get shorter as individuals aged as support for this. He interpreted all these features– the short <b>second</b> <b>toe</b> with enlarged claw, short metatarsus, etc.– as support for the use of the hind leg as an offensive weapon, where the sickle claw would strike downwards and backwards, and the leg pulled back and down at the same time, slashing and tearing at the prey. Ostrom suggested that the short metatarsus reduced overall stress on the leg bones during such an attack, and interpreted the unusual arrangement of muscle attachments in the Deinonychus leg as support for his idea that a different set of muscles was used in the predatory stroke than in walking or running. Therefore, Ostrom concluded that the legs of Deinonychus represented a balance between running adaptations needed for an agile predator, and stress-reducing features to compensate for its unique foot weapon.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1960s, the dromaeosaurids and troodontids {{have often}} been {{classified}} together in a group or clade named the Deinonychosauria, initially based primarily {{on the presence of}} a retractable <b>second</b> <b>toe</b> with sickle-claw (now also known to be present in some primitive birds). The name Deinonychosauria was coined by Ned Colbert and Dale Russell in 1969, and defined as a clade (all theropods closer to dromaeosaurids than to birds) by Jaques Gauthier in 1986. Through the early 2000s, consensus among paleontologists was that dromaeosaurids were most closely related to the troodontids, and together with the troodontids, with deinonychosaurians in turn the sister taxon to avialans, and therefore the closest relatives of avialan birds. In 2012, Turner et al. conducted a phylogenetic analysis (using a dataset of 474 characters scored for 111 taxa) which found Deinonychosauria to be monophyletic. However, several more recent studies have cast doubt on the hypothesis that dromaeosaurids and troodontids were more closely related to each other than either was to birds. A more robust 2013 study by Godefroit et al. (using a dataset of 1,500 characters scored for 358 taxa) found that troodontids were possibly more closely related to birds than to dromaeosaurids; forcing troodontids to remain in a monophyletic Deinonychosauria required four extra steps in the analysis, making this result less likely but not implausible. Because Deinonychosauria was originally defined as all animals closer to dromaeosaurids than to birds without specific reference to troodontids, Deinonychosauria is a synonym of Dromaeosauridae if Troodontidae is closer to birds.|$|E
25|$|Proper {{technique}} {{is also evident}} from a dancer's body alignment, by visualizing a straight line that extends {{from the center of}} the hip through the toes. When a properly aligned dancer is viewed from the side, the line passes through the knee, ankle joint, and big toe joints. When viewed from the front, the line passes through the knee, ankle joint, and the joints of the <b>second</b> <b>toe</b> or middle toe or the area between those toe joints. In cases of unusually high instep or metatarsal joint flexibility, it is sometimes necessary to flex the toes to achieve proper alignment.|$|E

30|$|Hallux varus, syndactaly and {{conjoint}} delta first metatarsals are {{the most}} common toe deformities associated with FH that benefit from surgical treatment of the toes. Syndactaly of the first to <b>second</b> <b>toes</b> is easily treated by release and skin grafting. Syndactaly between the middle toes {{does not need to be}} separated. Hallux varus is always associated with a short bracket (delta) first metatarsal. In most cases this is a conjoint metatarsal (fusion of first and second metatarsal) associated with syndactaly of the first and <b>second</b> <b>toes.</b> The treatment for this requires separation of the syndactaly combined with splitting of the conjoint metatarsal into two parts and reorienting of this osteotomy to realign the first metatarso-phalangeal joint surface.|$|R
25|$|San Francisco {{increased}} their lead to 24-7 {{early in the}} third quarter, driving 46 yards in 10 plays to score with Gary Anderson's 34-yard field goal. But the Vikings responded with Cunningham's 53-yard completion to Reed setting up a 3-yard touchdown reception by Carter, narrowing the gap to 24-14. Replays showed the officials blew the call on Reed's reception because his <b>second</b> <b>toe</b> came down on the end line, but it didn't make much difference because the 49ers {{came back with a}} 75-yard touchdown drive with Kirby rushing for gains of 22 and 14 yards on the first two plays. Young's 15-yard pass to Terrell Owens made the score 31-14.|$|E
500|$|Ostrom {{compared}} Deinonychus to the ostrich and cassowary. He {{noted that}} the bird species can inflict serious injury with the large claw on the <b>second</b> <b>toe.</b> The cassowary has claws up to [...] long. Ostrom cited Gilliard (1958) in saying that they can sever an arm or disembowel a man. Kofron (1999 and 2003) studied 241 documented cassowary attacks and found that one human and two dogs had been killed, but no evidence that cassowaries can disembowel or dismember other animals. Cassowaries use their claws to defend themselves, to attack threatening animals, and in agonistic displays such as the Bowed Threat Display. The seriema also has an enlarged <b>second</b> <b>toe</b> claw, and uses it to tear apart small prey items for swallowing.|$|E
500|$|There is {{currently}} disagreement about {{the function of}} the enlarged [...] "sickle claw" [...] on the <b>second</b> <b>toe.</b> When John Ostrom described it for Deinonychus in 1969, he interpreted the claw as a blade-like slashing weapon, much like the canines of some saber-toothed cats, used with powerful kicks to cut into prey. Adams (1987) suggested that the talon was used to disembowel large ceratopsian dinosaurs. The interpretation of the sickle claw as a killing weapon applied to all dromaeosaurids. However, Manning et al. argued that the claw instead served as a hook, reconstructing the keratinous sheath with an elliptical cross section, instead of the previously inferred inverted teardrop shape. In Manning's interpretation, the <b>second</b> <b>toe</b> claw would be used as a climbing aid when subduing bigger prey and also as stabbing weapon.|$|E
50|$|Flip-flops are {{a type of}} sandal {{typically}} worn as a form {{of casual}} wear. They consist of a flat sole held loosely on the foot by a Y-shaped strap that passes between the first and <b>second</b> <b>toes</b> and around both sides of the foot.|$|R

500|$|Like other theropods, dromaeosaurids were bipedal; that is, {{they walked}} on their hind legs. However, whereas most theropods walked with three toes {{contacting}} the ground, fossilized footprint tracks confirm that many early paravian groups, including the dromaeosaurids, held the <b>second</b> <b>toe</b> off {{the ground in a}} hyperextended position, with only the third and fourth toes bearing the weight of the animal. This is called functional didactyly. The enlarged <b>second</b> <b>toe</b> bore an unusually large, curved, falciform (sickle-shaped, alt. drepanoid) claw (held off the ground or 'retracted' when walking), which is thought to have been used in capturing prey and climbing trees (see [...] "Claw function" [...] below). This claw was especially blade-like in the large-bodied predatory eudromaeosaurs. One possible dromaeosaurid species, Balaur bondoc, also possessed a first toe which was highly modified in parallel with the second. Both the first and second toes on each foot of B. bondoc were also held retracted and bore enlarged, sickle-shaped claws.|$|E
500|$|The {{well-known}} early avialan, Archaeopteryx, {{dates from}} slightly later Jurassic rocks (about 155 million years old) from Germany. Many {{of these early}} avialans shared unusual anatomical features that may be ancestral to modern birds, but were later lost during bird evolution. These features include enlarged claws on the <b>second</b> <b>toe</b> {{which may have been}} held clear of the ground in life, and long feathers or [...] "hind wings" [...] covering the hind limbs and feet, which may have been used in aerial maneuvering.|$|E

50|$|The {{branches}} of the superficial peroneal nerve supply {{the skin of the}} dorsal surfaces of all the toes excepting the lateral side of the little toe, and the adjoining sides of the great and <b>second</b> <b>toes,</b> the former being supplied by the lateral dorsal cutaneous nerve from the sural nerve, and the latter by the medial branch of the deep peroneal nerve.|$|R
500|$|Like all primates, lemurs {{have five}} {{divergent}} digits with nails (in most cases) {{on their hands}} and feet. Most lemurs possess a laterally compressed, elongated nail, called a toilet-claw, on the <b>second</b> <b>toe</b> and use it for scratching and grooming. In addition to the toilet-claw, lemurs share a variety of other traits with other strepsirrhine primates, which include a rhinarium (or [...] "wet nose"); a fully functional vomeronasal organ, which detects pheromones; a postorbital bar and the lack of postorbital closure (a wall of thin bone behind the eye); orbits (bony sockets that enclose the eye) that are not fully facing forward; left and right mandible (lower jaw) bones that are not fully fused; and a small brain-to-body mass ratio.|$|E
500|$|Balaur is a genus of {{theropod}} dinosaurs {{estimated to}} have lived about [...] {{years ago in the}} late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian), and contains the single species B. bondoc. The bones of this species were shorter and heavier than those of other basal paravians. While the feet of most early paravians bore a single, large [...] "sickle claw" [...] on the <b>second</b> <b>toe</b> which was held retracted off the ground, Balaur had large retractable sickle claws on both the first and second toes of each foot. In addition to its strange feet, the type specimen of Balaur is unique for its status of being the most complete theropod fossil from the late Cretaceous of Europe. It also possesses a great number of additional autapomorphies, including a reduced and presumably nonfunctional third finger, consisting of only one rudimentary phalanx.|$|E
500|$|The holotype tooth {{is roughly}} 25 percent larger than {{equivalent}} Dromaeosaurus teeth, {{from which a}} body length of [...] or more was estimated for Dromaeosauroides; {{it may have been}} as long as [...] In an interview, Christiansen estimated its skull to be [...] long and the animal's weight a Bengal tiger of the same length would weigh [...] by comparison. As a dromaeosaur, Dromaeosauroides would have had a large sickle claw on its highly mobile <b>second</b> <b>toe,</b> like its relatives Dromaeosaurus, Velociraptor and Deinonychus. This group is closely related to birds, and the NaturBornholm interpretive centre houses a roughly life-sized sculpture of Dromaeosauroides covered in feathers. Later Chinese finds of well-preserved feathered dromaeosaurs indicate that the sculpture should have more and longer feathers to be accurate. Although some smaller dromaeosaurs may have been able to fly, flight was unlikely for an animal the size of Dromaeosauroides.|$|E
5000|$|The holotype {{specimen}} of Utahraptor is fragmentary, consisting of skull fragments, a tibia, claws and some caudal (tail) vertebrae.
