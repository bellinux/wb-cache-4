50|$|A <b>snap</b> <b>cap</b> is {{a device}} which is {{shaped like a}} {{standard}} firearm cartridge but contains no primer, propellant, or projectile.|$|E
50|$|A {{small number}} of rimfire and {{centerfire}} firearms of older design should not be test-fired with the chamber empty, as {{this can lead to}} weakening or breakage of the firing pin and increased wear to other components in those firearms. In the instance of a rimfire weapon of primitive design, dry firing can also cause deformation of the chamber edge. For this reason some shooters use a <b>snap</b> <b>cap</b> in an attempt to cushion the weapon's firing pin as it moves forward.|$|E
50|$|It is {{generally}} acceptable to dry fire more modern centerfire firearms without a cartridge or <b>snap</b> <b>cap.</b> Older designs {{such as the}} CZ 52 and Colt Single Action Army are exceptions. However, dry firing a rimfire firearm, striker based firearms or guns with angled firing pins (such as revolvers with hammer-mounted firing pins or older shotguns) can damage the gun. Furthermore, damage can occur to the chamber mouth of a rimfire firearm. Ultimately, one should check with the manufacturer of the gun to ascertain if {{it is safe to}} dry fire.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Snap</b> <b>caps</b> and action-proving dummy {{cartridges}} {{also work}} as a training tool to replace live rounds for loading and unloading drills, as well as training for misfires or other malfunctions, as they function identically to a live [...] "dud" [...] round that has not ignited.|$|R
50|$|It is used {{to ensure}} that dry firing {{firearms}} of certain designs does not cause damage. Some <b>snap</b> <b>caps</b> contain a spring-damped false primer, or one made of plastic, or none at all; the springs or plastic absorb force from the firing pin, allowing the user to safely test {{the function of the}} firearm without damaging its components.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, and I {{have just}} {{examined}} the caps {{to see that}} they are dry; for it's not like grouse-shooting on the Scottish hills this African hunting, depend upon it. A <b>snapping</b> <b>cap</b> might cost us our lives,-- Ralph, my boy, you must keep well in rear. I don't want to hurt your feelings, but it won't do to go in front when you cannot depend on your nerves." ...|$|R
40|$|A {{cluster of}} {{poliovirus}} type 3 -positive specimens cultured in shell vials {{led to the}} discovery of significant cross contamination between vials related to the type of vial cap. Simulated testing with colored media in the shell vials indicated that the most contamination occurred with the plastic <b>snap</b> <b>cap</b> and that the least occurred with the screw cap. Measures to prevent cross contamination in clinical virology laboratories are discussed...|$|E
5000|$|Dry firing is the {{practice}} of [...] "firing" [...] a firearm without ammunition. That is, {{to pull the trigger}} and allow the hammer or striker to drop on an empty chamber. Dry firing may be mechanically damaging to some firearms - especially rimfire weapons, where the firing pin in most designs will impact the breech face if the weapon is dry-fired. Because of this, precautions (such as the use of <b>snap</b> <b>caps)</b> need to be taken if such a weapon is to be deliberately dry-fired.|$|R
50|$|This {{technique}} {{is often used}} to simulate actual firing when there is not a suitable place to practice with live ammunition. The primary benefit of this practice is refined trigger control. For most common cartridges, there are <b>snap</b> <b>caps</b> available {{to reduce the risk of}} damaging the firing pin. The technique allows people to conduct a safe, economical form of training to improve their shooting skills. An emphasis is placed on safety to prevent an accidental discharge. Training should be conducted in an area with no ammunition and with a suitable backstop.|$|R
5000|$|Drill rounds are inert {{versions}} of cartridges used {{for education and}} practice during military training. Other than the lack of propellant and primer, {{these are the same}} size as normal cartridges and will fit into the mechanism of a gun {{in the same way as}} a live cartridge does. Because dry-firing (releasing the firing pin with an empty chamber) a gun can sometimes lead to firing pin (striker) damage, dummy rounds termed <b>snap</b> <b>caps</b> are designed to protect centerfire guns from possible damage during [...] "dry-fire" [...] trigger control practices.|$|R
5000|$|Modern vials {{are often}} {{made out of}} plastic or {{sometimes}} glass. There are often used as storage for small quantities of liquid used in medical or molecular biology applications. There are several different types of commonly used closure systems. For glass vials, options include screw vials (closed with a screw cap or dropper/pipette), lip vials (closed with a cork or plastic stopper) and crimp vials (closed with a rubber stopper and a metal cap). [...] Plastic vials, which can be moulded in plastic, can have other closure systems, such as 'hinge caps' which snap shut when pressed. These are sometimes called flip-tops or <b>snap</b> <b>caps.</b>|$|R
50|$|When storing {{chemical}} wastes, {{the containers}} {{must be in}} good condition and should remain closed unless waste is being added. Hazardous waste must be stored safely prior to removal from the laboratory {{and should not be}} allowed to accumulate. Container should be sturdy and leakproof, also has to be labeled. All liquid waste must be stored in leakproof containers with a screw- top or other secure lid. <b>Snap</b> <b>caps,</b> mis-sized caps, parafilm and other loose fitting lids are not acceptable. If necessary, transfer waste material to a container that can be securely closed. Keep waste containers closed except when adding waste. Secondary containment should be in place to capture spills and leaks from the primary container, segregate incompatible hazardous wastes, such as acids and bases.|$|R
60|$|Presently {{appeared}} the Gerad, accompanied by two men, who brought my servants' arms, and the revolver which I had {{sent to the}} prince. This was a contretemps. It was clearly impossible {{to take back the}} present, besides which, I suspected some finesse to discover my feelings towards him: the other course would ensure delay. I told the Gerad that the weapon was intended especially to preserve the Amir's life, and for further effect, <b>snapped</b> <b>caps</b> in rapid succession to the infinite terror of the august company. The minister returned to his master, and soon brought back the information that after a day or two another mule should be given to me. With suitable acknowledgments we arose, blessed the Gerad, bade adieu to the assembly, and departed joyful, the Hammal in his glee speaking broken English, even in the Amir's courtyard.|$|R

40|$|To prevent {{foodborne}} diseases, {{wash your}} hands with clean water and soap before and after you eat or prepare food and after you use the latrine or bathroom. If {{you do not have}} clean water, use waterless hand sanitizers until clean water is available for washing. Do not eat any food that has not been sealed in waterproof containers (commercially canned or sealed plastic containers) and that may have come in contact with untreated water, such as seawater, floodwater, river water, or pond water. Throw away any food not in nonsealed, nonwaterproof containers that has come in contact with untreated water. Undamaged commercially canned foods can be saved. Remove the can labels, wash the outsides of the cans with soapy water, and thoroughly disinfect the cans using a solution of 1 cup (8 ounces; approximately 0. 25 liters) of household bleach (5. 25 %) in 5 gallons (approximately 19 liters) of treated drinking-quality water. Use a marker to note the contents and expiration date on the cans. If opened food containers have screw <b>caps,</b> <b>snap</b> lids, crimped <b>caps</b> (soda pop bottles), twist caps, or flip tops, or if they have been home canned, throw them away if they have come in contact with untreated water.

The apparatus is particularly adapted for quick positioning of electrodes to obtain an EEG. The individual electrodes are formed of a sponge body which is filled with a conductive electrolyte gel during manufacture. The sponge body is adjacent to a base formed of a conductive plastic material. The base has at its center a male gripper <b>snap.</b> The <b>cap</b> locates the female snap to enable the electrode to be positioned. The electrode can be stored and used quickly by attaching to the female gripper snap. The snap is correctly positioned and located by mounting it in a stretchable cap.

Briefly, safetying is defined as: [...] "Securing by various means any nut, bolt, turnbuckle etc., on the aircraft so that vibration will not cause it to loosen during operation." [...] These practices are not a means of obtaining or maintaining torque, rather a safety device to prevent the disengagement of screws, nuts, bolts, <b>snap</b> rings, oil <b>caps,</b> drain cocks, valves, and parts. Three basic methods are used in safetying; safety-wire, cotter pins, and self-locking nuts. Retainer washers and pal nuts are also sometimes used.|$|R
6000|$|So all {{the game}} which {{we saw was}} a lovely white Egret, {278} its back covered with those stiff pinnated plumes which young ladies-- when they can obtain them--are {{only too happy to}} wear in their hats. [...] He, after being civil enough to wait on a bough till one of us got a sitting shot at him, heard the <b>cap</b> <b>snap,</b> thought it as well not to wait till a fresh one was put on, and flapped away. He need not have troubled himself. The Negroes--but too apt to forget {{something}} or other--had forgotten to bring a spare supply; and the gun was useless.|$|R
5000|$|One wretched fellow {{slipped from}} the rope {{by which he}} was tied to the guns just before the explosion, and his arm was nearly set on fire. While hanging in his agony under the gun, a {{sergeant}} applied a pistol to his head; and three times the <b>cap</b> <b>snapped,</b> the man each time wincing from the expected shot. At last a rifle was fired {{into the back of}} his head, and the blood poured out of the nose and mouth like water from a briskly handled pump. This was the most horrible sight of all. I have seen death in all its forms, but never anything to equal this man's end.|$|R

Kevin Duala was born in Liverpool and is a supporter of Liverpool Football Club. He was a very keen footballer before an injury ended his career {{and he went to}} drama school. He began working as a stage actor and starred as Rocky 1 in Starlight Express. His role was cut short when his knee <b>cap</b> <b>snapped</b> while on stage and he had to be rushed to hospital. He is perhaps best known for the role of 'Kevin' in the British version of Blue's Clues for Nick Jr. His other television credits include Who Wants To Be a Great Cook?, Allsorts, and Modelmania.

5000|$|There {{are a few}} {{techniques}} for different applications. The word safetying is a term universally used in the aircraft industry. Briefly, safetying is defined as: [...] "Securing by various means any nut, bolt, turnbuckle etc., on the aircraft so that vibration will not cause it to loosen during operation." [...] These practices are not a means of obtaining or maintaining torque, rather a safety device to prevent the disengagement of screws, nuts, bolts, <b>snap</b> rings, oil <b>caps,</b> drain cocks, valves, and parts. The wire itself maintains tension and remains in place by being twisted around itself and attached to the fastener to be secured on one end and an anchor point (which could be another fastener) on the other end. Since safety wire is made of a malleable alloy, it retains its shape after being bent, rather than springing back to its original shape. This property allows it to remain locked around an object, such as when it is passed through a small hole on a fastener, looped back upon itself and then twisted. The same process is then repeated around the anchor point, which could be another fastener. Since it remains twisted instead of unraveling, it acts as a fixed loop and will not back out without considerable force (greater than the stresses which {{it is intended to}} counter) being applied.|$|R
50|$|Roberts {{fought in}} the Indian Rebellion of 1857 (also known as the Indian Mutiny) seeing action during the siege and capture of Delhi where he was {{slightly}} wounded, and being present at the relief of Lucknow, where, as Deputy Assistant Quartermaster-General, he {{was attached to the}} staff of Sir Colin Campbell, Commander-in-Chief, India. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for actions on 2 January 1858 at Khudaganj. The citation reads: Lieutenant Roberts' gallantry has on every occasion been most marked.On following the retreating enemy on 2 January 1858, at Khodagunge, he saw in the distance two Sepoys going away with a standard. Lieutenant Roberts put spurs to his horse, and overtook them just as they were about to enter a village. They immediately turned round, and presented their muskets at him, and one of the men pulled the trigger, but fortunately the <b>caps</b> <b>snapped,</b> and the standard-bearer was cut down by this gallant young officer, and the standard taken possession of by him. He also, on the same day, cut down another Sepoy who was standing at bay, with musket and bayonet, keeping off a Sowar. Lieutenant Roberts rode to the assistance of the horseman, and, rushing at the Sepoy, with one blow of his sword cut him across the face, killing him on the spot. He was also mentioned in despatches for his service at Lucknow in March 1858. In common with other officers he transferred from the East India Company Army to the Indian Army that year.|$|R
6000|$|So {{young mothers}} tried {{as well as}} they could to satisfy both desires, and their babes were brought to them at all unseasonable hours, while they were full of food and wine, or heated with dancing or play, and there {{received}} the nurture which, but for Rousseau, they would have drawn in more salutary sort from a healthy foster-mother in the country. This, however, was only an incidental drawback to a movement which was in its main lines full of excellent significance. The importance of giving freedom to the young limbs, of accustoming the body to rudeness and vicissitude of climate, of surrounding youth with light and cheerfulness and air, and even a tiny detail such as the propriety of substituting for coral or ivory some soft substance against which the growing teeth might press a way without irritation, all these matters are handled with a fervid reality of interest that gives to the tedium of the nursery a genuine touch of the poetic. Swathings, bandages, leading-strings, are condemned with a warmth like that with which the author had denounced comedy.[280] The city is held up to indignant reprobation as the gulf of infant life, just as it had been in his earlier pieces as the gulf of all the loftiest energies of the adult life. Every child ought to be born and nursed in the country, and it would be all the better if it remained in the country to the last day of its existence. You must accustom it little by little to the sight of disagreeable objects, such as toads and snakes; also in the same gradual manner to the sound of alarming noises, beginning with <b>snapping</b> a <b>cap</b> in a pistol. If the infant cries from pain which you cannot remove, make no attempt to soothe it; your caresses will not lessen the anguish of its colic, while the child will remember what it has {{to do in order to}} be coaxed and to get its own way. The nurse may amuse it by songs and lively cries, but she is not to din useless words into its ears; the first articulations that come to it should be few, easy, distinct, frequently repeated, and only referring to objects which may be shown to the child. [...] "Our unlucky facility in cheating ourselves with words that we do not understand, begins earlier than we suppose." [...] Let there be no haste in inducing the child to speak articulately. The evil of precipitation in this respect is not that children use and hear words without sense, but that they use and hear them in a different sense from our own, without our perceiving it. Mistakes of this sort, committed thus early, have an influence, even after they are cured, over the turn of the mind for the rest of the creature's life. Hence it is a good thing to keep a child's vocabulary as limited as possible, lest it should have more words than ideas, and should say more than it can possibly realise in thought.[281] ...|$|R
