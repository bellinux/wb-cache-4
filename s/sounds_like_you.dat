2500|$|Tim Sendra from Allmusic said: [...] "The {{title of}} Carla Bruni's 2008 album, Comme Si de Rien N'Etait (As If Nothing Had Happened), {{is a good}} joke. After all, since her last album Bruni fell into a {{whirlwind}} romance with French President Nicolas Sarkozy and ended up marrying him and becoming the [...] "First Lady" [...] of France. That's a pretty big [...] "something", and indeed it isn't often that the romance of a singer and a president is chronicled on record as it is here—though {{you need to be}} fluent in French to catch the details, since only her cover of '50s pop classic [...] "You Belong to Me" [...] (which is a witty nod to a semi-scandalous trip the couple took to Egypt and other exotic locales before they were wed) is in English. You don't need to know exactly what's going on lyrically, because the intimate-sounding arrangements on the ballads and the light and breezy sound of the more uptempo tunes clue you in that there is romance in the air. Along with the nice arrangements, the best thing about the album is Bruni's intimate and sultry singing. She can purr like a Gainsbourg girl, strut sassily, or croon quite tenderly—sometimes all within the same song. Most of the time she <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> always hoped a '60s French bombshell would sound but never quite did (think Bardot or Birkin). Not surprisingly, Bruni appears totally in control throughout the album, which could be down to her having written almost all of the songs herself, or could be down to her new position in the world. Whatever the reason, it makes for quite an improvement over her previous album, No Promises, and fulfills the promise of her charming debut, Quelqu'un M'a Dit. It is probably the best album released by a [...] "First Lady", but beyond that, it's a pleasant, sometimes compelling album by a singer/songwriter with some stories to tell and a lovely way of telling them." [...] BBC said: [...] "Bruni's disc may not win her new fans in the stolidly un-French speaking UK. But removed from the context of her very public private life, this is a charming album." [...] The Telegraph said: [...] "The Premiere Dame may have a colourful past, but her music has always been as classically chic and subtly sexy as her Christian Dior wardrobe." [...] SFGate said: [...] "Even before she married French president Nicolas Sarkozy, Carla Bruni had a thing for prominent men such as Mick Jagger and Donald Trump. So even though the lyrics on her third album, [...] "Comme Si de Rien N'Etait" [...] ("As If Nothing Happened"), were written before her latest romantic coup, it's hard to separate content from context, especially when, in the song [...] "Tu Es Ma Came", the singer describes her lover as [...] "more dangerous than Colombian white". But the mild-mannered music hardly matches the exuberance of lines like that. Slathered with strings, horns, and folk and blues guitars, Bruni's new album is not quite as charming as her 2003 premiere, [...] "Quelqu'un M'a Dit". Still, songs such as [...] "L'Amoureuse" [...] and [...] "Déranger Les Pierres" [...] are quite beautiful, and [...] "Salut Marin", a tribute to her late brother, might represent one of Bruni's finest recorded moments yet." ...|$|E

This was followed by performances in Atlanta, at the Ravinia Festival (with Conrad Tao as pianist), in Omaha, Dallas, and with her hometown Pittsburgh Opera on October 16, 2011. Conductor Antony Walker took the opportunity to introduce her fans to the Pittsburgh Opera's chorus and soloists, who performed several numbers from Verdi, Bizet and Puccini along with Evancho's repertoire. Evancho made her New York City solo concert debut at Avery Fisher Hall in Lincoln Center on November 7, 2011. The tour was then interrupted by three concerts, described below, to promote Evancho's album Heavenly Christmas.

[...] In addition to the setting not feeling right, O'Donnell was used to writing music with other people and found it difficult to take over sole writing duties. He reached out to Planes Mistaken for Stars' original bassist Aaron Wise (who only appeared on their debut self-titled EP). Wise ultimately told O'Donnell to return to his family. O'Donnell said: [...] "He came out and we had a couple adventures, and then he was like, 'It <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> just need to go home and focus on clearing your head and being with your family.'

5000|$|On August 2, 2017, Miller had {{a heated}} {{exchange}} with CNN's Jim Acosta at the White House daily briefing regarding the Trump administration's {{support for the}} RAISE Act to sharply limit legal immigration and favor immigrants with high English proficiency. Acosta said that the proposal was at odds with American traditions concerning immigration and noted that the Statue of Liberty welcomes immigrants to the U.S., invoking verses from Emma Lazarus's The New Colossus. Miller disputed {{the connection between the}} Statute of Liberty and immigration, pointing out that [...] "the poem that you're referring to, that was added later, is not actually a part of the original Statue of Liberty." [...] Miller added that immigration has [...] "ebbed and flowed" [...] throughout American history and asked how many immigrants the U.S. had to accept annually to [...] "meet Jim Acosta's definition of the Statue of Liberty law of the land." [...] Distinguishing between the Statue of Liberty and Lazarus's poem has been a popular talking point among the anti-Semitic alt-right. The Washington Posts Michelle Ye Hee Lee stated that [...] "Neither got it quite right about the Statue of Liberty ... While the poem itself was {{not a part of the}} original statue, it actually was commissioned in 1883 to help raise funds for the pedestal" [...] and [...] "gave another layer of meaning to the statue beyond its abolitionist message." [...] Acosta questioned: [...] "Are we just going to bring in people from Great Britain and Australia?" [...] Miller replied: [...] "I am shocked at your statement that you think that only people from Great Britain and Australia would know English. It reveals your cosmopolitan bias to a shocking degree." [...] According to Lee: [...] "Miller has the edge here. English is an official language in dozens of countries other than Great Britain and Australia, and is spoken in roughly 100 countries." [...] In addition, [...] "Miller is correct that English proficiency currently is a requirement for naturalization." [...] Jeff Greenfield, writing in Politico, observed that [...] "cosmopolitan" [...] has historically been used as a code word for Jews.

5000|$|Regarding the {{negative}} reviews, film critic Liz Braun's {{headline in the}} Toronto Sun summarized the opinion of most Toronto critics, [...] "Jack Richards is Amateurish at Best." [...] Hannah Guy from Now (newspaper) wrote, [...] "Benjamin Paquette's debut feature ... is an awkward fledgling of a movie with mediocre production values," [...] but concluded that, [...] "veteran thesp Vrana delivers an authentic performance." [...] Especially dismissive were Chris Knight at the National Post, and Liam Lacey at the Globe and Mail. The former declared, “Film critics see movies ... with pages of press notes. ... But the press notes can, however, make all the difference. A Year in the Death of Jack Richards ... is a labyrinth of a film and I would have been lost without the notes. As it was, I was merely disoriented. ... The press notes refer to the film’s ability to ‘trouble and perplex,’ which I got right away; its ‘warmth and deep understanding,’ which I missed and its ‘electrifying’ nature, which I presume is {{a reference to the}} joybuzzer shock cuts, always accompanied by the same ’70s-era photo of a greasyhaired guy with a thick moustache ... The press notes say this ‘challenging film experience ... is sure to be most appreciated by those viewers who are engaged by film as film.” If that <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>you,</b> enjoy some popcorn as popcorn and settle back, prepared to be shocked out of your seat as a seat.” The latter stated, “... often more ambitious than accomplished. ... With everything up in the air, a viewer might be forgiven for finding this chain of ambiguities more pretentious than intriguing ... The plot's Twilight Zone-like entanglements might be more palatable if the film's execution were more adept. ... the acting ranges from mediocre to amateur. The character who hires Jack ... wears possibly the worst bald wig outside a joke store. In some close-ups, Vrana's untrimmed eyebrows threaten to engulf the screen. There's one particularly static scene in a hotel room where the camera operator seems to have crouched into the corner and fallen asleep. Perhaps he or she dreamed the whole thing.” A rare negative review outside of Toronto came from Melora Koepke at the Hour Community, who concluded, “While it's a good thing that there are film students to write papers about classic auteur films, it's a bit weird to watch a movie that feels more like the paper than the film. Which is how A Year in the Death of Jack Richards rings - more like an idea than an actual movie. ... If puzzles and ambivalence are your bag, then A Year in the Death of Jack Richards is a godsend. Paquette is clearly just as concerned with muddling the edges of reality, blurring tenses in his storylines and inserting numerous homages to his cinema idols (Ingmar Bergman and Roman Polanski, probably) as he is with riveting his audience. Of course, if you have a film studies paper due, you're in luck. For others, A Year in the Death of Jack Richards is definitely a matter of taste.” ...|$|E
