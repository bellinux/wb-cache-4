They then return to Athens in the epilogue to bless the couples, becoming once again the benevolent fairy king and queen.|$|E

500|$|Wenger apologised for his team’s behaviour: [...] "I feel {{we should}} not have reacted at all. Overall we are <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> happened. When you do not behave like you want to, then you have to apologise." [...] He had no regrets over his team {{selection}} and suggested {{it was part of the}} player's learning process. Wenger said of Walcott: [...] "…he had a very good performance and scored a great goal. That is good for us and good news for England." [...] Gilberto Silva described Arsenal’s defeat as a “sad memory” and wanted to use the loss to motivate the team for their coming matches.|$|E
500|$|Guandique faced {{a minimum}} penalty of 30 {{years to a}} maximum of life {{imprisonment}} without the possibility of parole. In seeking the maximum possible sentence, the prosecutors stated that Guandique [...] "is unable to control himself and thus, will always remain a danger to women". A memo submitted by the prosecution in February 2011 cited Guandique's harassment of female staff in prison, including soliciting a nurse and masturbating in front of guards. Assistant U.S. Attorney Fernando Campoamor-Sanchez disclosed that he had traveled to El Salvador with a detective to investigate allegations that Guandique had fled his native country because of suspected attacks against local women dating back to 1999. During the sentencing hearing on February 11, Guandique said to Levy's family, [...] "I am <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> happened to your daughter", and insisted on his innocence. Before Judge Gerald Fisher reminded Susan Levy to address the court instead of the defendant, Levy said to him, [...] "Did you really take her life? Look me in my eyes and tell me." [...] Fisher denied Guandique's motion for retrial and handed down a sentence of 60 years in prison, stating that Guandique [...] "will be a danger for some time. He's a sexual predator." ...|$|E
500|$|Karofsky {{appears in}} three {{additional}} episodes {{later in the}} second season. Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) decides in the episode [...] "Born This Way" [...] {{that she wants to}} become prom queen; she sees Karofsky and realizes he would be a credible prom king partner moments before she sees him checking out a male student's butt and also realizes he is as closeted as she is. She then blackmails him into teaming up with her as a pretend couple—beards—and starting an anti-bullying club, with the purpose of getting Kurt to return to McKinley and New Directions. Karofsky apologizes to Kurt for his bullying in a meeting with Will, Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba), and their respective fathers Paul (Daniel Roebuck) and Burt; Kurt is happy to be able to transfer back. In [...] "Prom Queen", with the prom less than a week away, Karofsky and Santana arrange to guard Kurt at school when they learn he will be bringing Blaine as his prom date; Karofsky tells Kurt, tearfully, that he is <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> he did to him. At the prom, Karofsky is voted prom king but Santana is not elected prom queen; instead, an appalled Kurt is written in and wins. As they take the floor for the traditional prom king and queen dance, Kurt suggests that this is Karofsky's chance to come out and [...] "make a difference", but Karofsky is not ready to do so, and walks away.|$|E

Well, my lad, I'm <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>what's</b> happened, but talking won't {{do it any}} good.

500|$|In [...] "The Born-Again Identity", it's {{revealed}} that Castiel survived. After the Leviathans left him, {{he made his}} way out of the river, naked, and ran into his future wife Daphne. However, the experience renders Castiel amnesic, but with his angelic powers intact. Going by the name [...] "Emanuel", Castiel used his powers to heal people, though he didn't know where that ability and his power to see demon's true faces came from. After Sam is committed to a mental hospital as a result of the hallucinations of Lucifer he is suffering due to Castiel breaking his [...] "mental wall", Dean searches for [...] "Emanuel" [...] and kills a demon that is holding his wife hostage. Castiel agrees to help Dean who doesn't tell him who he really is, but mentions what [...] "Cas" [...] had done to Sam. The two are joined by Meg, but upon reaching the hospital, find demons surrounding the entrance. As Castiel is the only one who can take them all down, Dean is forced to tell him the truth about who he really is and insists he has the power to kill the demons. Castiel manages to summon his power to kill demons and kills all of them, but doing so restores his memories. Castiel shows remorse for his previous actions and initially wants to leave, but Dean is able to convince him to help by giving him back his trench coat. Castiel finds Sam in time to save him from a demon torturing him to death with electro-shock therapy and tries to restore his mental wall, but can't as it's completely gone. Feeling <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> he had done, Castiel transfers the problem to himself and is haunted by visions of Lucifer like Sam was. Castiel is committed to the mental hospital, but is safe from the demons as only Meg knows he's alive and she takes a job at the hospital, presumably to look after him. In [...] "Party On, Garth", Dean calls Meg and she reveals that Castiel's in the same condition, which Sam feels guilty about.|$|E
2500|$|Miller said {{he would}} be enlisting the help of one or more psychiatrists to examine his client, who said {{this was not the first}} time she had no {{recollection}} of something that had happened. He said he did not know if Bishop was insane; determining whether she was culpable for her actions would be left to a psychiatrist. He did say that she was [...] "very <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> she's done." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dupas {{was again}} {{released}} from prison in February 1985. Approximately one month later, he raped a 21-year-old woman on a beach at Blairgowrie. After alighting from his car, Dupas followed the woman and attacked her, holding {{her to the ground}} at knifepoint before raping her. He later told police: [...] "I'm <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> happened. Everyone was telling me I'm OK now. I never {{thought it was going to}} happen again. I only wanted to live a normal life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> that. <b>What</b> sort of trouble?" [...] He {{knew that}} his uncle and his aunt's family were always short of money, and was already {{considering}} to what extent he would go in granting her petition.|$|R

2500|$|Due to her testimony, Still {{and three}} of the dockworkers were acquitted. [...] "Two, John Ballard and William Curtis, were convicted of assault, fined $10, and imprisoned for a week. A {{reporter}} on the scene wrote of them: 'I have just seen four of the five men who acted so brave a part of the rescue. They are very respectable looking persons, and instead of being <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> they did, would like nothing better than a chance to repeat the offense'." ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 17, 2007, Berger relinquished {{his license}} to {{practice}} law {{as a result of}} the Justice Department investigation. Saying, [...] "I have decided to voluntarily relinquish my license. ... While I derived great satisfaction from years of practicing law, I have not done so for 15 years and do not envision returning to the profession. I am very <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> I did, and I deeply apologize." [...] By giving up his license, Berger avoided cross-examination by the Bar Counsel regarding details of his thefts.|$|E
2500|$|Izz al-Masri {{was escorted}} to the {{restaurant}} by Ahlam Tamimi, a 20-year-old female university student and part-time journalist, who had disguised herself as a Jewish tourist for the occasion. She later commented {{that she was not}} <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> she had done and does not recognize Israel’s existence. [...] "Despite the fact that I'm sentenced to 16 life sentences I know that we will become free from Israeli occupation and then I will also be free from the prison," [...] she said. When she first learned from a journalist who was interviewing her in jail that she had murdered eight children, not just three as she had initially believed, she just smiled broadly and continued with the interview.|$|E

60|$|Campbell [5] will be desperately annoyed. I {{never saw}} a man (and of him I have seen very little) so sensitive;--what a happy temperament! I am <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> it; <b>what</b> can he fear from criticism? I don't know if Bland has seen Miller, who was to call on him yesterday.|$|R
2500|$|In 2006, Havins {{was asked}} if she felt that Babe had been {{redeemed}} since the baby switch. Havins replied, [...] "More or less. That's not {{something that can be}} done overnight; it takes time. And I don't think it's necessarily acts, like one heroic act, that redeem someone." [...] She clarified: It's just showing change. She's very remorseful and there's regret with the whole situation. It's one thing if somebody didn't feel <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> they did, but she repented for her sins. Everyone has a past. Everyone makes mistakes. The only {{thing you can do is}} move on and try to be a better person from that point forward. When Bianca forgives Babe in 2007 for keeping her child from her, there were viewers who still felt that it was due to Bianca being in love with Babe, and were upset that Bianca could not seem to resist any interaction with her. In a 2007 interview with TV Guide, Havins seemed perplexed that a significant number of viewers had still not forgiven Babe for the baby switch, and felt that the character had been redeeming herself.|$|E

[...] (Chapter XII) and [...] "I felt, like the man in the fable, as if some one had played a mean trick on me, and substituted for my brain a side order of cauliflower."
