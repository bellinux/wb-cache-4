25|$|Based on the study, Quezon is {{classified}} {{into two categories}} namely: deep and <b>shallow</b> <b>well</b> areas. <b>Shallow</b> <b>well</b> areas generally consist of recent formations with slopes ranging from zero to three percent. Most of these areas are located at elevations within 50 meters above mean sea level, like alluvial and coastal plains and river valleys. Shallow wells may also have deep-water aquifer and are less susceptible to salt water intrusion. Deep well areas generally consist of sedimentary formations, 90 percent of which are water carriers, These are usually located in slopes reaching up to 10%, usually at elevations of more than 50 meters above sea level. The waters from deep wells are in general, of good quality.|$|E
25|$|The Salisbury Plain chalk massif {{is part of}} {{a system}} of chalk downlands {{throughout}} eastern and southern England formed by the rocks of the Chalk Group; the landscape is underlain by a combination of Lower, Middle and Upper Chalk supporting <b>shallow</b> <b>well</b> drained calcareous silty soils over chalk on slopes and crests. Escarpments are often formed where layers of chalk have been compressed to form a fold, or where the chalk has been faulted, resulting in accelerated erosion along the line of the weakness.|$|E
2500|$|Hearing {{about the}} growing Oregon wine {{industry}} {{and the work of}} pioneering winemakers making Pinot noir, the Casteel brothers and their wives sold their houses in Seattle, Washington and purchased land that was slated to become a trailer park in the Eola Hills northwest of the city of Salem, Oregon. The land was deemed [...] "not suitable for farming" [...] but the Casteels found the south-facing slope with good exposure and <b>shallow,</b> <b>well</b> drained soils to be ideal for viticulture so they purchased the land and planted [...] of Pinot noir vines in 1977. The Casteel named area Bethel Heights after the unincorporated area of Bethel, Polk County, Oregon where the estate is located.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the dead}} {{of the night in}} secret, Táhirih was taken to the nearby garden Ilkhani in Tehran, and with her own veil was strangled to death. Her body was thrown into a <b>shallow</b> <b>well</b> and stones thrown upon it. A {{prominent}} Bábí, and subsequently Bahá'í, historian cites the wife of an officer who had the chance to know her that she was strangled by a drunken officer of the government with her own veil which she had chosen for her anticipated martyrdom. One of her most notable quotes is her final utterance, [...] "You can kill me as soon as you like, but you cannot stop the emancipation of women." [...] She was then aged about 35, and was the mother of three children. [...] Dr Jakob Eduard Polak, the Shah's physician, was an eye-witness to the execution and described it as: [...] "I was witness to the execution of Qurret el ayn, who was executed by the war minister and his adjutants; the beautiful woman endured her slow death with superhuman fortitude". `Abdu'l-Bahá eulogized Táhirih writing that she was a [...] "woman chaste and holy, a sign and token of surpassing beauty, a burning brand of the love of God". The Times on 13 October 1852 reports the death of Táhirih, describing her as the [...] "Fair Prophetess of Kazoeen", and the [...] "Bab's Lieutenant".|$|E

60|$|This accident, much to Roland Clewe's chagrin, {{discovered}} {{to the public}} {{the existence of the}} great shaft. Whether or not he would announce its existence himself, or whether he would close it up, had not been determined by Clewe; but when he and Margaret had talked over the matter soon after the terrible incident, his mind was made up beyond all possibility of change, and, by means of great bombs, the shaft was shattered and choked up for a depth of half a mile from its mouth. When this work was accomplished, nothing remained but a <b>shallow</b> <b>well,</b> and, when this had been filled up with solid masonry, the place where the shaft had been was as substantial as any solid ground.|$|E

60|$|The wind {{seemed to}} be {{dropping}} and the sparks were not quite so bad {{when they reached the}} house. They found a bucket, and after smashing more of the ice upon the <b>shallow</b> <b>well</b> Frank climbed up on the woodshed which reached to the low roof. The latter was covered with cedar shingles and he wondered why it had not ignited, because the sparks were still dropping upon it and there were several charred spots. This, however, was not a question of much consequence, and Harry kept him busy during the next half hour sluicing the roof with water which he passed up in the bucket. Some of it went over Frank's hands and clothing and it was icy cold, but they worked on steadily while the fire worked back farther from them into the bush. It had burned most fiercely when it had the dry branches in the slashing to supply it, but these were all licked up, and though the small stuff blazed the great standing trunks would not burn. There were already rows of them rising, charred and blackened columns, behind the slashing.|$|E

40|$|Four {{different}} {{water sources}} (irrigation canals, small reservoirs, <b>shallow</b> <b>wells,</b> and tubewells), used for domestic purposes, in an irrigated area in southern Sri Lanka, were tested for Giardia spp. cysts and Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts. Identification of these parasites in water sources is important {{as these are}} increasingly recognized as causative agents of waterborne diarrhoeal disease. All the four sources of water were contaminated with cysts and oocysts. The sources of surface-water contained a greater num-ber of protozoa compared to tubewells and <b>shallow</b> <b>wells</b> (p< 0. 05). The results indicate a reduction of high parasite loads by natural filtration as the water moves from canals to <b>shallow</b> <b>wells</b> through the soil profile. This could present an opportunity to reduce the burden of diarrhoeal disease due to protozoa by selecting an appropriate source of drinking-water and identifying those water sources that require treatment solutions...|$|R

40|$|Millions of {{households}} throughout Bangladesh {{have been exposed}} to high levels of arsenic (As) causing various deadly diseases by drinking groundwater from shallow tubewells for the past 30 years. Well testing has been the most effective form of mitigation because it has induced massive switching from tubewells that are high (> 50 µg/L) in As to neighboring wells that are low in As. A recent study has shown, however, that <b>shallow</b> low-As <b>wells</b> {{are more likely to be}} contaminated with the fecal indicator E. coli than <b>shallow</b> high-As <b>wells,</b> suggesting that well switching might lead to an increase in diarrheal disease. Approximately 60, 000 episodes of childhood diarrhea were collected monthly by community health workers between 2000 and 2006 in 142 villages of Matlab, Bangladesh. In this cross-sectional study, associations between childhood diarrhea and As levels in tubewell water were evaluated using logistic regression models. Adjusting for wealth, population density, and flood control by multivariate logistic regression, the model indicates an 11 % (95 % confidence intervals (CIs) of 4 - 19 %) increase in the likelihood of diarrhea in children drinking from <b>shallow</b> <b>wells</b> with 10 - 50 µg/L As compared to <b>shallow</b> <b>wells</b> with > 50 µg/L As. The same model indicates a 26 % (95 %CI: 9 - 42 %) increase in diarrhea for children drinking from <b>shallow</b> <b>wells</b> with ≤ 10 µg/L As compared to <b>shallow</b> <b>wells</b> with > 50 µg/L As. Children drinking water from <b>shallow</b> low As <b>wells</b> had a higher prevalence of diarrhea than children drinking water from high As wells. This suggests that the health benefits of reducing As exposure may to some extent be countered by an increase in childhood diarrhea...|$|R

40|$|In many {{developing}} countries a close linkage exists between drinking and irrigation water; however, the effects of irrigation management on drinking water availability and quality, and what drinking water supplies are best suited to irrigated areas, have been little studied. Bacterial contamination and salinity of drinking water sources in a community within the Uda Walawe irrigation system of southern Sri Lanka were monitored from August to December 2000. Water with the lowest combination of faecal contamination and salt content (highest quality) was found in <b>shallow</b> <b>wells,</b> recharged with seepage water from the irrigation system. Of these wells, those surrounded by a protective wall had the lowest levels of thermotolerant coliforms (median of 244 ThCU 100 ml- 1) as compared to <b>shallow</b> <b>wells</b> without protective walls (549 ThCU 100 ml- 1). Furthermore, tube well waters were highly saline (average of 0. 67 mS cm- 1), while canal and reservoir waters had high thermotolerant coliform levels (3940 and 950 ThCU 100 ml- 1). Interseasonal canal closures eliminate the canals as a water source, lowering water levels in <b>shallow</b> <b>wells,</b> and thus reducing regional water availability. Concrete lining of canals may exacerbate the drying up of <b>shallow</b> <b>wells</b> during canal closure, therefore eliminating {{the primary source of}} water in the region {{that can be used for}} drinking after only simple treatment...|$|R
