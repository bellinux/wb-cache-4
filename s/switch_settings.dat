A mechanically switching vehicle, maneuvering between two adjacent junctions with different <b>switch</b> <b>settings,</b> cannot proceed from one junction to the next.

500|$|Control of a Leslie {{speaker is}} {{normally}} catered for by an external two way switch, between two settings marked [...] "chorale" [...] and [...] "tremolo". The switch is mounted onto the controlling instrument, so the player can easily <b>switch</b> <b>settings.</b> Some earlier models {{were limited to}} [...] "off" [...] and [...] "tremolo", and some later models had all three settings. The switch can be used while notes are being played, {{and the sound of}} changing between the two settings is part of the characteristic sound. On both settings, the treble horn rotates slightly faster than the bass woofer; about 50 revolutions per minute (rpm) for [...] "chorale" [...] and 400 rpm for [...] "tremolo", compared to the woofer's 40 rpm and 340 rpm respectively.|$|E

40|$|The {{connection}} of far shore wind power plants {{can be made}} using either HVAC or HVDC cables. For connections over 60 to up to 160 km, HVAC and HVDC technologies are competing in terms of cost, efficiency and reliability, and this depending on distance, power and voltage level. One of the key issues with longer HVAC cables is the reactive power management. This paper discusses the proposed design of a reactive power controller of a far shore HVAC grid connection under construction. The controller helps to reduce the negative effects associated with the increased capacitive charging current linked to the increasing HVAC cable lengths. Optimal usage of the reactive power capabilities of the both the Wind Turbine Generators (WTG) and the available onshore reactive compensation can lead to significant reduction of the active power losses resulting in financial gains. A method is discussed that determines the optimal <b>switching</b> <b>settings</b> for the onshore reactive compensation {{in order to minimize}} the active power losses in the offshore grid. As a case study, the optimal <b>switching</b> <b>settings</b> are determined for the GEMINI wind farm. Finaly, an analysis is presented taking into account both active power losses and number of switching actions. For the GEMINI case study, reductions of the active power losses up to 2000 MWh can be achieved compared to the base case. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|Hamilton was {{the fastest}} {{driver in the}} third (and final) {{practice}} session, which was held in chilly but bright weather conditions, {{with a time of}} one minute and 37.107; Rosberg struggled with a brake issue until the session's closing minutes and went faster in the first and second sectors but an untidy final sector caused by an glazed left rear brake disc only allowed him to improve his best time by one thousand of a second and the result meant he was second-fastest. Massa was third-fastest; his teammate Bottas was fourth, Alonso fifth and Ricciardo sixth. Hülkenberg was seventh-quickest, Adrian Sutil eighth, Räikkönen ninth and Button completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Upon <b>switching</b> <b>settings</b> on his car's steering wheel, Hamilton spun under braking at turn 12, and Rosberg ran wide at the eleventh and twelfth corners. Vergne's session was prematurely ended when his engine cut out.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{adaptive}} modulation and coding (AMC) algorithm dedicated {{to reduce the}} feedback frequency of the channel state information (CSI). There have been already plenty of works on AMC so as to exploit the bandwidth more efficiently with the CSI feedback to the transmitter. However, in some occasions, frequent CSI feedback is not favorable in these systems. This work considers finite-state Markov chain (FSMC) based channel prediction to alleviate the feedback while maximizing the overall throughput. We derive the close-form of the frame error rate (FER) based on channel prediction using limited CSI feedback. In addition, instead of <b>switching</b> <b>settings</b> according to the CSI, we also provide means to combine both CSI and FER as the switching parameter. Numerical results illustrate that the average throughput of the proposed algorithm has significant performance improvement over fixed modulation and coding while the CSI feedback being largely reduced...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} maximizing the {{weighted}} throughput in various <b>switching</b> <b>settings</b> has been intensively studied recently through competitive analysis. To date, the most general model {{that has been}} investigated is the standard CIOQ (Combined Input and Output Queued) switch architecture with internal fabric speedup S geq 1. CIOQ switches, that comprise the backbone of packet routing networks, are N times N switches controlled by a switching policy that incorporates two components: Admission control and scheduling. An admission control strategy is essential to determine the packets stored in the FIFO queues in input and output ports, while the scheduling policy conducts the transfer of packets through the internal fabric, from input ports to output ports. The online problem of maximizing the total weighted throughput of CIOQ switches was recently investigated by Kesselman and Ros 2 ̆ 7 en [SPAA 03]. They presented two different online algorithms for the general problem that achieve non-constant competitive ratios (linear in either the speedup {{or the number of}} distinct values, or logarithmic in the value range). We introduce the first constant-competitive algorithm for the general case of the problem, with arbitrary speedup and packet values. Specifically, our algorithm is 8 -competitive, and is also simple and easy to implement...|$|R
50|$|A {{standard}} problem in using crossbar switches {{is that of}} setting the crosspoints.

In Asynchronous Transfer Mode or packet switching applications, the crosspoints must be made and broken at each decision interval. In high-speed <b>switches,</b> the <b>settings</b> {{of all of the}} crosspoints must be determined and then set millions or billions of times per second. One approach for making these decisions quickly is {{through the use of a}} wavefront arbiter.|$|R
