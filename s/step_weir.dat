The experiments were performed with large discharges corresponding to Reynolds numbers ranging from 5 × 104 to 1 × 106.

Up to date, the effects of step roughness on the flow properties remain unknown despite the practical relevance to damaged concrete steps, rock chutes and gabions weirs. New measurements were conducted in a large-size laboratory facility with two step conditions (smooth and rough) and three types of step roughness. Detailed air-water flow properties were measured systematically for several flow rates. The results showed faster flow motion on rough step chutes. Although the finding is counter-intuitive, it is linked with the location of the inception point of free-surface aeration being located further downstream than for a smooth stepped chute for an identical flow rate. In the aerated flow region, the velocities on rough-step chutes were larger than those of smooth chute flows for a given flow rate and dimensionless location from the inception point of free-surface aeration both at step edges and between step edges.

In this paper, samples of wastewater, taken from Gabal EL Asfar drain, has been utilized to investigate the effect of falling height and BOD 5 concentrations on the increase of DO in wastewater upon falling over <b>stepped</b> <b>weirs.</b> Utilizing tap water, as a reference, the first run of tests yielded that the concentration of DO increased from 0. 0 mg/l at 0. 0 cm-falling height, after de-oxygenation using Na 2 SO 3, to 2. 95 mg/l at a falling height of 100 cm.

A third run of tests with the same configurations was done to investigate the effect of BOD 5 concentration in the falling water on the DO level gained upon falling from different heights.

40|$|This PhD thesis {{addresses}} the hydraulic behaviour of pooled stepped chutes; a geometry frequently utilized by dams to spill floodwater {{defined by the}} existence of endsills or weirs perpendicular to the flow {{at the end of}} each <b>step.</b> <b>Weirs</b> increase the energy dissipation and can cause the formation of unsteady flow, therefore the steady inflow of the flat stepped chutes was observed. Weirs are also used in steep mountain rivers to control the bed load transport. Based on hydraulic model tests with chute angles of 8. 9 °, 14. 6 ° and 18. 6 °, and dimensionless weir heights between 0 and 1. 0 (weir height w and step height s), the flow resistance, flow patterns, and the energy dissipation was investigated at high discharges in skimming flow regime. To quantify the properties of air-water flow, a double-tip conductivity probe was developed to measure the vertical profiles of air concentration and flow velocities. A video based water level measurement technique was used to investigate the unstable flow regions. This measurement method allowed for automatic water level detection and the qualitative analysis of the flow patterns by monitoring the movement of air bubbles. The work makes a significant contribution to understanding the hydraulics of pooled stepped chutes. The energy dissipation is now quantifiable if the geometry parameters of the steps are given. Furthermore the mechanism of how the self induced unsteady flow develops is described in detail. Hints of how to calculate the parameters of this unstable flow region (occurrence, wave height and wave frequencies) are also provided. Finally, design guidelines for engineers are presented...|$|R

Nevertheless, generally, the scour process occurs in corre-spondence with a flood event, which is characterized by discharge varying with time. This last condition is still less studied and analyzed in terms of effects on scour process.

Namely, an abrupt symmetrically enlarged channel was simulated downstream of block ramps. Eco-friendly protection structures, such as rock sills, were tested to limit the erosive process. Rock sills were placed transversally at different longitudinal and vertical positions in the stilling basin and scour morphology variations were investigated.
