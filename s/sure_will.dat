25|$|Furious {{at their}} escape, Leontes now {{publicly}} accuses {{his wife of}} infidelity, and declares that the child she is bearing must be illegitimate. He throws her in prison, over the protests of his nobles, and sends two of his lords, Cleomenes and Dion, to the Oracle at Delphos for what he is <b>sure</b> <b>will</b> be confirmation of his suspicions. Meanwhile, the queen gives birth to a girl, and her loyal friend Paulina takes the baby to the king, {{in the hopes that}} the sight of the child will soften his heart. He grows angrier, however, and orders Paulina's husband, Lord Antigonus, to take the child and abandon it in a desolate place. Cleomenes and Dion return from Delphos with word from the Oracle and find Hermione publicly and humiliatingly put on trial before the king. She asserts her innocence, and asks for the word of the Oracle to be read before the court. The Oracle states categorically that Hermione and Polixenes are innocent, Camillo an honest man, and that Leontes will have no heir until his lost daughter is found. Leontes shuns the news, refusing to believe it as the truth. As this news is revealed, word comes that Leontes' son, Mamillius, has died of a wasting sickness brought on by the accusations against his mother. Hermione, meanwhile, falls in a swoon, and is carried away by Paulina, who subsequently reports the queen's death to her heartbroken and repentant husband. Leontes vows {{to spend the rest of}} his days atoning for the loss of his son, his abandoned daughter, and his queen.|$|E

His debut came in Barnsley's 2–2 draw away to Blackpool in the League Cup on 22 August 2006, which Barnsley {{went on to win}} 4–2 in a penalty shoot-out, and was booked during the match for a collision with Blackpool goalkeeper Rhys Evans. He scored his first Barnsley goal with a close range header in the third minute of stoppage time away to Southend United in the FA Cup third round on 6 January 2007, making the score 1–1. He finished 2006–07 with one goal in six appearances.|$|E

500|$|The media {{focused on}} Häkkinen {{overtaking}} Michael Schumacher {{for the lead}} on lap 41, and after the race Häkkinen went to Schumacher in the parc fermé and {{told him not to}} make a move like that again. Zonta later said that although he was unaware of Häkkinen's presence, he saw Schumacher in his mirrors. Derick Allsop of The Independent described the impact the move might have on Häkkinen's career: [...] "Perhaps, he [...] will be recognised as a driver worthy of a place in the pantheon of the sport's heroes." [...] According to McLaren team principal Ron Dennis, [...] "His overtaking manoeuvre I'm <b>sure</b> <b>will</b> go down {{as one of the greatest}} in Formula One history", and in February 2001 Häkkinen's move was chosen by more than 60 Formula One historians as the MasterCard Priceless Moment of the 2000 F1 season.|$|E
500|$|The {{inspiration}} behind Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... {{came from}} Yash Chopra's Kabhi Kabhie (1976). On being {{inspired by the}} classic, Karan quoted, [...] "What appealed to me {{was the fact that}} the love story stretched out across generations. It began with youth and went on as the people grew older. You could say that Kabhi Kabhie is the starting point for my new film, that I am inspired by it. But the film, I am <b>sure,</b> <b>will</b> be very different. It will look different, feel different." [...] Similarly, Karan added an extra [...] "e" [...] to the second Kabhi in the title of his film, due to numerological reasons. In an interview with The Times of India, Karan dispelled comparisons with Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and said that while his debut film was [...] "frothy and bubble-gummish", this one was [...] "more classy and sophisticated". He added that there would be [...] "plenty of drama" [...] in this film too, but handled more maturely.|$|E

Clark Green (Clark Duke) feels he {{is ready for the}} position, citing his key role in various sales, but Dwight wants someone who he can be <b>sure</b> <b>will</b> not team up with Pam against him. To that end, he brings in a bizarre gallery of his relatives and close friends, including his cousin Mose (Michael Schur), best friend Rolf (James Urbaniak), part-time private investigator Trevor (Chris Gethard), former Corporate executive Troy Undercook (Noel Petok), and his karate teacher Sensei Ira (Lance Krall). To Dwight's horror, though, none of his candidates are competent enough to even make it through the full job interview, much less be paper salesmen. Clark ends his interview after answering Dwight's complicated questions perfectly, pointing out that he {{has no choice but to}} hire him if he wants someone who can do the job.|$|E

Siriol Hugh-Jones wrote for The Times Literary Supplement, [...] "The Phantom Tollbooth is something every adult seems <b>sure</b> <b>will</b> turn into a modern Alice... The obvious {{guess is that the}} appeal of this sort of writing is directed towards just the sort of adults who derive a perfectly grown-up pleasure from regularly rereading the Alices. As one might expect, it is illustrated by every grown-up's favourite child-like pictures with the built-in sad sophistication, the work of Jules Feiffer." [...] Jennifer Bourdillon reviewed it for The Listener, [...] "This is the story of an imaginary journey, a sort of Pilgrim's Progress of a little boy in his car... One would hardly have thought from the sound of this that it would have so magnetic an appeal, but the brilliant verbal humour and the weird and wonderful characters (the Dodecahedron. the Watchdog, Faintly Macabre) make it that rare delight, a book which parents and children can share." [...] It reached Australia in 1963; The Canberra Times reviewer, J.E.B., deemed it memorable, causing readers to quote from it and leaf through its pages again.|$|E

Throughout our career, we never did what anyone wanted us to do. We never made the records people wanted us to make. We never played by the rules people wanted us to play by. And here we are, 25 years later, still a band. Clearly that means something. And if we did ever play or make new music or anything, {{it would be a very}} big deal. And there's a lot of bands that I've seen come along during that 25-year period that did everything the record companies and the powers-that-be wanted them to do, and they sold millions of records. But where are they now? They're gone." [...] Morello added, [...] "Right now...the cold embers of Rage Against the Machine are now the burning fire of Prophets of Rage. Where Rage Against the Machine lives, is this summer in these songs that we are playing. And we have nothing but the greatest love and honor and respect for Zack de la Rocha, the brilliant lyricist of Rage Against the Machine, who is working on his own music, which I'm <b>sure</b> <b>will</b> be fantastic—he's a great artist in his own right.

[...] Montagu Curzon of The Spectator wrote that [...] "Guest makes an astonishingly mature debut (he is 27) and has the rare ability to describe childhood as a small child lives it; accepting, helpless, curious." [...] Lois Kendall gave the book a positive review in Cultic Studies Review, and wrote: [...] "The book is deep, yet light and readable, both for those who have had similar life experiences and who, I am <b>sure,</b> <b>will</b> find solace in this book, and for those with no such personal experience, who will find the narrative fascinating." [...] Publishers Weekly characterized My Life in Orange as [...] "Honest and vivid, this is an absorbing book about survival and good intentions gone awry." [...] Gillian Engberg of Booklist called the book a [...] "stirring memoir", and wrote: [...] "Guest writes with a reporter's sense of economy and restraint, letting absurd, even shocking details speak for themselves."
