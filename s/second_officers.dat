60|$|It was {{arranged}} that Charlie {{should go in}} the long-boat with the captain, Raywood the passenger, and ten men of the crew. The remainder were to be divided between the other two boats which were {{to be in charge}} of the first and <b>second</b> <b>officers</b> respectively.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, captain," [...] I replied, as respectfully as I knew how, [...] "the {{fourth day}} out I had the {{unhappiness}} {{to be drawn}} into a dispute about a game of cards with your first and <b>second</b> <b>officers.</b> In the absence of those excellent seamen, sir, I thought it my duty to assume control of the ship." ...|$|E
60|$|All {{the matters}} that I have been {{treating}} of, however, were merely incidental, and quite {{distinct from the}} real business of the office. A great part of {{the wear and tear}} of mind and temper resulted from the bad relations between the seamen and officers of American ships. Scarcely a morning passed, but that some sailor came to show the marks of his ill-usage on shipboard. Often, it was a whole crew of them, each with his broken head or livid bruise, and all testifying with one voice to a constant series of savage outrages during the voyage; or, it might be, they laid an accusation of actual murder, perpetrated by the first or <b>second</b> <b>officers</b> with many blows of steel-knuckles, a rope's end, or a marline-spike, or by the captain, in the twinkling of an eye, with a shot of his pistol. Taking the seamen's view of the case, you would suppose that the gibbet was hungry for the murderers. Listening to the captain's defence, you would seem to discover that he and his officers were the humanest of mortals, but were driven to a wholesome severity by the mutinous conduct of the crew, who, moreover, had themselves slain their comrade in the drunken riot and confusion of the first day or two after they were shipped. Looked at judicially, there appeared to be no right side to the matter, nor any right side possible in so thoroughly vicious a system as that of the American mercantile marine. The Consul could do little, except to take depositions, hold forth the greasy Testament to be profaned anew with perjured kisses, and, in a few instances of murder or manslaughter, carry the case before an English magistrate, who generally decided that the evidence was too contradictory to authorize the transmission of the accused for trial in America. The newspapers all over England contained paragraphs, inveighing against the cruelties of American shipmasters. The British Parliament took up the matter (for nobody is so humane as John Bull, when his benevolent propensities are to be gratified by finding fault with his neighbor), and caused Lord John Russell to remonstrate with our government on the outrages for which it was responsible before the world, and which it failed to prevent or punish. The American Secretary of State, old General Cass, responded, with perfectly astounding ignorance of the subject, to the effect that the statements of outrages had probably been exaggerated, that the present laws of the United States were quite adequate to deal with them, and that the interference of the British Minister was uncalled for.|$|E

Bush, filed an affidavit from a <b>second</b> <b>officer</b> who had served with OARDEC. Like Abraham, this <b>second</b> <b>officer,</b> whose name was redacted from the Supreme Court documents, was also a reservist and an attorney in civilian life. He wrote: [...] "training was minimal" [...] -and- ``"the process was not well defined". Abraham was allowed to sit on only one Tribunal. The <b>second</b> <b>officer</b> sat on 49 Tribunals.|$|R

50|$|When {{they found}} that there was no hope of saving the ship, Shaw ordered the ship's {{carpenter}} to hammer shut the after hatch, trapping the passengers below, but another seaman wrenched it open.

50|$|In {{the ensuing}} fight, Favorite {{attempted}} {{to board the}} British flagship , distancing herself {{from the rest of}} her squadron. As the two ships neared, Amphion discharged a howitzer full of bullets which rendered a large number of the French casualties. Dubourdieu himself was killed at 9:10. Favorites first officer and <b>second</b> <b>officers</b> were killed as they attempted again to board Amphion. As she sailed around Amphion in an attempt to rake her and take her in a crossfire with the other French frigates, Favorite was outmanoeuvred and ran aground.|$|E
50|$|In {{his work}} with the uniformed services, he {{established}} {{with a series of}} courses for officers of the Royal Air Force to qualify them for further studies at the staff college level.

This led the Admiralty to appoint Gibbs to its Naval Educational Advisory Council, which saw him rise to become its vice-chairman and then chairman.|$|E

These woman were tasked with the hazardous job of ferrying all types of aircraft from factories to aircraft storage units and despatch points, and on to operational stations. When she joined the ATA she had flown 900 hours. By March 1943 she had flown one thousand and eight hundred hours more.|$|E

50|$|Equally {{critical}} to the 314's success was the proficiency of its Pan Am flight crews, who were extremely skilled at long-distance, over-water flight operations and navigation. For training, many of the transpacific flights carried a second crew. Only the very best and most experienced flight crews were assigned Boeing 314 flying boat duty. Before coming aboard, all Pan Am captains as well as first and <b>second</b> <b>officers</b> had thousands of hours of flight time in other seaplanes and flying boats. Rigorous training in dead reckoning, timed turns, judging drift from sea current, astral navigation, and radio navigation were conducted. In conditions of poor or no visibility, pilots sometimes made successful landings at fogged-in harbors by landing out to sea, then taxiing the 314 into port.|$|E
5000|$|Colonel Selway {{turned the}} non-commissioned {{officers}} {{out of their}} club {{and turned it into}} a <b>second</b> <b>officers</b> club. He then classified all white personnel as cadre, and all African-Americans as trainees. One officers club became the cadre's club. The old Non-Commissioned Officers Club, promptly sarcastically dubbed [...] "Uncle Tom's Cabin", became the trainee's officers club. At least four of the trainees had flown combat in Europe as fighter pilots, and had about four years in service. Four others had completed training as pilots, bombardiers and navigators, and may have been the only triply qualified officers in the entire Air Corps. Several of the Tuskegee Airmen had logged over 900 flight hours by this time. Nevertheless, by Colonel Selway's fiat, they were trainees.|$|E
