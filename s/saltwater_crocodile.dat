5|$|Crocodilians {{are found}} mainly in {{lowlands}} in the tropics, but alligators also {{live in the}} southeastern United States and the Yangtze River in China. They are largely carnivorous, the various species feeding on animals such as fish, crustaceans, molluscs, birds, and mammals; some species like the Indian gharial are specialised feeders, while others like the <b>saltwater</b> <b>crocodile</b> have generalised diets. Crocodilians are typically solitary and territorial, though cooperative feeding does occur. During breeding, dominant males try to monopolise available females. Females lay eggs in holes or in mounds and, unlike most other reptiles, care for their hatched young.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are recorded}} as making 242 unprovoked attacks between 1948 and mid-2004, causing sixteen human fatalities. Ten {{of these were}} {{in the water and}} two were on land; the circumstances of the other four are not known. Most attacks were in the warmer months of the year, though in Florida, with its warmer climate, attacks can happen at any time of year. Alligators are considered to be less aggressive than either the Nile or <b>saltwater</b> <b>crocodile,</b> but the increase in density of the human population in the Everglades has brought people and alligators into closer proximity and increased the risk of alligator attacks. Conversely in Mauritania, where the crocodiles' growth is severely stunted by the arid conditions, the local people swim with them without being attacked.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians are {{opportunistic}} predators {{that are}} at their most dangerous in water and {{at the edge of}} water. Eight species are known to attack humans and may do so to defend their territories, nests, or young; by mistake, while attacking domestic animals such as dogs; or for food, as larger crocodilians can take prey as big as or bigger than humans. The species on which there is most data are the <b>saltwater</b> <b>crocodile,</b> the Nile crocodile, and the American alligator. Other species which have sometimes attacked humans are the black caiman, the Morelet's crocodile, the mugger crocodile, the American crocodile, the gharial, and the freshwater crocodile.|$|E
25|$|Freshwater {{crocodiles}} {{are found}} in the states of Western Australia, Queensland, and the Northern Territory. Main habitats include freshwater wetlands, billabongs, rivers and creeks. This species could live in areas where <b>saltwater</b> <b>crocodiles</b> could not, and are known to inhabit areas above the escarpment in Kakadu National Park and in very arid and rocky conditions (such as Katherine Gorge, where they are common and are relatively safe from <b>saltwater</b> <b>crocodiles</b> during the dry season). However, they are still consistently found in low-level billabongs, living alongside the <b>saltwater</b> <b>crocodiles</b> near the tidal reaches of rivers.|$|R

5|$|This {{crocodile}} is to {{be found}} in the freshwater swamps, marshes and lakes of New Guinea, particularly in the interior. It has been known to enter brackish waters such as those of the Fly River estuary but is very rare in coastal areas, and never found in the presence of the competing <b>saltwater</b> <b>crocodile</b> (C. porosus). The animal was first described from the Sepik River area in the north of Papua New Guinea. A separate population is found in the southern half of the island, with a range that extends from southeastern Papua New Guinea to the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua. It is separated from the northern population by the New Guinea Highlands, a mountain range that runs along the centre of the island. DNA analysis has revealed these to be genetically separate populations, and there are some differences in their morphology and behavior. There are estimated to be between 50,000 and 100,000 New Guinea crocodiles in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{maternal}} care they receive, hatchlings commonly fall to predation. While the female is transporting some {{to the nursery}} area, others are picked off by predators that lurk near the nest. The hatchlings {{are a source of}} food for most of the creatures that feed on eggs, and are also subject to aquatic attacks by turtles, fish, and snakes. Birds of prey take their toll, and in any clutch there may be malformed individuals that are unlikely to survive. In northern Australia, the survival rate for <b>saltwater</b> <b>crocodile</b> hatchlings is only twenty-five percent, but with each succeeding year of life this improves, reaching sixty percent by year five. Mortality rates are fairly low among subadults and adults, though they are occasionally preyed on by large cats and snakes. The jaguar and the giant otter may prey on caimans in South America. In other parts of the world, elephants and hippopotamuses may kill crocodiles defensively. Authorities differ as to whether much cannibalism takes place among crocodilians. Adults do not normally eat their own offspring, but there is some evidence of subadults feeding on juveniles and of adults attacking subadults. In Nile crocodiles, rival males sometimes kill each other during the breeding season.|$|E
25|$|According to Wondjina, {{the mythology}} of Indigenous Australians, the <b>saltwater</b> <b>crocodile</b> was banished from the fresh water for {{becoming}} full of bad spirits and growing too large, unlike the freshwater crocodile, which was somewhat revered. As such, Aboriginal rock art depicting the <b>saltwater</b> <b>crocodile</b> is rare, although examples of up to 3,000 years old {{can be found in}} caves in Kakadu and Arnhem land, roughly matching the species distribution. The species is frequently depicted in contemporary aboriginal art.|$|E

25|$|The <b>saltwater</b> <b>crocodile</b> (Crocodylus porosus) is {{the largest}} reptile native to New Guinea. It is a widely {{distributed}} species, from eastern India to northern Australia. It is found in most of New Guinea's rivers, except for those heavily disturbed by humans, or too small to accommodate the species. The other crocodile native to New Guinea, the New Guinea crocodile (Crocodylus novaeguineae), is an endemic. It is {{much smaller than the}} <b>saltwater</b> <b>crocodile.</b> A separate species may occur in southern New Guinea.|$|E
25|$|The <b>saltwater</b> <b>crocodile</b> {{is one of}} {{the three}} {{crocodilians}} found in India, the other two being the more regionally widespread, smaller mugger crocodile and the narrow-snouted, fish-eating gharial. Apart from the eastern coast of India, the <b>saltwater</b> <b>crocodile</b> is extremely rare on the Indian subcontinent. A large population is present within the Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary of Odisha and they are known to be present in smaller numbers throughout the Indian and Bangladeshi portions of the Sundarbans. The <b>saltwater</b> <b>crocodile</b> also persists in bordering Bangladesh as does the mugger and gharial. Populations are also present within the mangrove forests and other coastal areas of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in India. Saltwater crocodiles were once present throughout most of the island of Sri Lanka, but remain mostly within protected areas such as Yala National Park, which also has a large population of mugger crocodiles.|$|E

25|$|While most {{crocodilians}} {{are social}} animals sharing basking spots and food, <b>saltwater</b> <b>crocodiles</b> are more territorial {{and are less}} tolerant of their own kind; adult males will share territory with females, but drive off rival males. <b>Saltwater</b> <b>crocodiles</b> mate in the wet season, laying eggs in a nest consisting of a mound of mud and vegetation. The female guards the nest and hatchlings from predators.|$|R
25|$|Unlike their {{much larger}} Australian relative, the <b>saltwater</b> <b>crocodile,</b> {{freshwater}} crocodiles {{are not known}} as man-eaters and rarely cause fatalities, although they will bite in self-defence if cornered.|$|E
25|$|In {{northern}} Australia (which {{includes the}} northernmost {{parts of the}} Northern Territory, Western Australia, and Queensland), the <b>saltwater</b> <b>crocodile</b> is thriving, particularly in the multiple river systems near Darwin such as the Adelaide, Mary, and Daly Rivers, along with their adjacent billabongs and estuaries. The <b>saltwater</b> <b>crocodile</b> population in Australia is estimated at 100,000 to 200,000 adults. In Australia, the species coexists with the smaller, narrow-snouted Johnston's or freshwater crocodile (C. johnstoni). Their range extends from Broome in Western Australia through the entire Northern Territory coast all the way south to Rockhampton in Queensland. The Alligator Rivers in the Arnhem Land region are misnamed due to the resemblance of the <b>saltwater</b> <b>crocodile</b> to alligators as compared to freshwater crocodiles, which also inhabit the Northern Territory. In New Guinea, they are also common, existing within the coastal reaches of virtually every river system in the country, such as the Fly River, along with all estuaries and mangroves, where they overlap in range but rarely in actuality or habitat with the rarer, less aggressive New Guinea crocodile (C. novaeguineae). They are also present in varying numbers throughout the Bismarck Archipelago, the Kai Islands, the Aru Islands, the Maluku Islands and many other islands within the region, including Timor, and most islands within the Torres Strait.|$|E
25|$|The <b>saltwater</b> <b>crocodile</b> (Crocodylus porosus) can {{be found}} in the {{southern}} part of the delta. The species was formerly abundant in coastal regions, but population numbers have decreased because of a combination of commercial skin hunting, habitat loss, drowning in fishing nets and over-collection of living animals to supply crocodile farms.|$|E

25|$|During the Japanese {{retreat in}} the Battle of Ramree Island on 19 February 1945, <b>saltwater</b> <b>crocodiles</b> {{may have been}} {{responsible}} for the deaths of over 400 Japanese soldiers. British soldiers encircled the swampland through which the Japanese were retreating, condemning the Japanese to a night in the mangroves, which were home to thousands of <b>saltwater</b> <b>crocodiles.</b> Many Japanese soldiers did not survive this night, but their death mainly as a result of crocodile attacks has been doubted. Another reported mass attack reportedly involve a cruise in eastern India where a boat accident forced 28 people into the water where they were reportedly consumed by <b>saltwater</b> <b>crocodiles.</b> Another notorious crocodile attack was in 1985, on ecofeminist Val Plumwood, who survived the attack.|$|R

25|$|Some {{reptiles}} are predators too, {{including two}} species of crocodiles, the <b>saltwater</b> <b>crocodile</b> (Crocodylus porosus) and mugger crocodile (Crocodylus palustris), {{as well as the}} gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) and the water monitor lizards (Varanus salvator), all of which hunt on both land and water. Sharks and the Gangetic dolphins (Platanista gangetica) roam the waterways.|$|E
25|$|While crocodilian {{brains are}} {{much smaller than}} those of mammals (as low as 0.05% of body weight in the <b>{{saltwater}}</b> <b>crocodile),</b> saltwater crocodiles are capable of learning difficult tasks with very little conditioning, learning to track the migratory route of their prey as the seasons change, and may possess a deeper communication ability than currently accepted.|$|E
25|$|The larger {{species of}} {{crocodiles}} are very dangerous to humans, {{mainly because of}} their ability to strike before the person can react.

25|$|Generally very lethargic, a trait {{which helps}} it survive {{months at a}} time without food, the <b>saltwater</b> <b>crocodile</b> will usually loiter in the water or bask in the sun during much of the day, preferring to hunt at night. A study of {{seasonal}} <b>saltwater</b> <b>crocodile</b> behaviour in Australia indicated that they are more active and more likely to spend time in the water during the Australian summer; conversely, they are less active and spend relatively more time basking in the sun during the winter. Saltwater crocodiles, however, are among the most active of all crocodilians, spending more time cruising and active, especially in water. They are much less terrestrial than most species of crocodiles, spending less time on land except for basking. At times, they tend to spend weeks at sea in search of land and in some cases, barnacles have been observed growing on crocodile scales, indicative of the long periods they spend at sea.|$|E
25|$|The <b>saltwater</b> <b>crocodile</b> {{has been}} extirpated from {{much of its}} former range within the Philippines and {{currently}} populations remain {{in only a few}} scattered locations. On the island of Mindanao the species is present within the Ligawasan Marsh and adjacent waterways in the southwest of the island and also within the Agusan Marsh Wildlife Sanctuary in the eastern portion of the island, where in September 2011 a 20.24 foot/6.17 meter <b>saltwater</b> <b>crocodile,</b> the largest reliably measured, was captured by locals following two fatal attacks. This species is also reported to be found within the mangroves of Languyan Island of the Tawi-Tawi province southwest of Mindanao and within the mangroves of Del Carmen municipality on Siargao Island northeast of Mindanao. On Luzon Island the species has been reported from three areas in the northeast: the Blos River of barangay Reina Mercedes, the Divilacan mangroves of barangay Dimasalansan and the Palanan River estuary of barangay Culasi. On the island of Palawan the species appears to remain within only the southern portion of the country and in recent years, attacks on humans have occurred within the Rio Tuba area near Bataraza on the southeast coast and from near Rizal on the southeastern coast. The species is also reported to be present within the islands of the Balabac Strait between the island of Palawan and the Malaysian Borneo state of Sabah. The status of the species within Naujan Lake on the island of Mindoro is unclear; crocodile eye-shines have been spotted in recent years and these are believed to belong to the <b>saltwater</b> <b>crocodile,</b> but it is unknown whether a viable population remains.|$|E
