Before the events of the pilot episode, Captain Black held a senior officer rank in Spectrum, an international security organisation inaugurated in 2067 that mobilises all its personnel, vehicles, and other resources in response to the threat posed by the Mysterons. The Spectrum Organisation is directed from Cloudbase, an airborne headquarters stationed at a height of 40,000feet above the Earth's surface, and has a presence in all major cities. The organisation employs operatives of many nationalities, of whom the most senior hold military ranks and colour-based codenames, are posted to Cloudbase, and answer directly to the commander-in-chief of Spectrum, Colonel White. Cloudbase is defended by the Angels, a squadron of five female pilots code-named Destiny (squadron leader), Harmony, Melody, Rhapsody, and Symphony, who fly the Angel Interceptor fighter aircraft. In addition, the organisation incorporates a fleet of Spectrum Pursuit Vehicles (SPV) hidden in secret locations around the world as well as Spectrum Patrol <b>Saloon</b> <b>Cars,</b> hovercraft, transport jets and machine-gun equipped helicopters.|$|E

25|$|November Girl (1967) {{contained}} key image collages which {{formed the}} basis of many graphic and surrealist experiments in the 1970s and 1980s. African Image (1967) was a visual homage to the indigenous people, culture, landscape and wildlife of sub-Saharan Africa. The images represent a lifelong interest in photographing graphically stimulating environments and formally document his passion for indigenous craft. He broke bones on river rapids and wrote off two Volvo <b>saloon</b> <b>cars</b> on African dirt roads while shooting the book. Despite its international award, this meticulously constructed book, celebrating a love for sub-Saharan Africa, is probably the least known of his major creative projects, but it is coveted by serious collectors of African art and photography.|$|E
25|$|The {{vehicles}} used in {{the series}} are loosely based on road-going, four-door <b>saloon</b> <b>cars.</b> Cars are custom made using a control chassis, with only certain body panels being common between the road cars and race cars. To ensure parity between each make of car, many control components are utilised. All cars must use a 5.0-litre, naturally aspirated V8 engine. Originally only for Ford Falcons and Holden Commodores, the New Generation V8 Supercar regulations, introduced in 2013, opened up the series to more manufacturers. Nissan were the first new manufacturer to commit to the series with four Nissan Altimas, followed briefly by Erebus Motorsport with three Mercedes-Benz E63 AMGs. Volvo entered the series in 2014 with Garry Rogers Motorsport racing the Volvo S60.|$|E

25|$|Frank Williams {{had been}} a motor-racing enthusiast since a young age, and after a career in <b>saloon</b> <b>cars</b> and Formula Three, backed by Williams' shrewd {{instincts}} as a dealer in racing cars and spares, he realised he'd reached his peak as a driver and started entering other drivers, in particular his friend and sometime flatmate Piers Courage. After Williams backed Courage in a successful 1968 Formula Two season, he purchased a Brabham Formula One car for Courage in 1969. This allegedly angered Jack Brabham, as the car had been sold to Williams {{with the expectation that}} it would be used in the Tasman Series and then converted to Formula 5000. Courage in fact had a great year, taking second place at both the Monaco and US Grands Prix.|$|E
25|$|As larger-capacity cars {{become more}} common, 500 cc racing began to decline, but the formula still gave close, {{exciting}} racing.

Initially, a long-distance race was planned, but in the end a 15-lap race was run which attracted four work entries from Connaught (B-Types for Archie Scott Brown, Les Leston, Jack Fairman and Stuart Lewis-Evans) opposed by privately entered Maserati 250Fs driven by Roy Salvadori and Bruce Halford and a selection of independents. Archie won from Lewis-Evans, with Salvadori setting a new lap record in the process at a speed of 75.66mph.

It has been tuned to run on E20 fuel and an improved Blaupunkt 2-DIN touchscreen head unit is offered in the Thai-spec Premium trim variant. In addition, a new budget-oriented Standard trim line was introduced in that market, priced significantly lower than the Executive and Premium trim variants. Brunei became the third export market to receive the Prevé on 7 February 2013, where it is made available in three variants. The Prevé was also met with a less publicized launch in Singapore during the first quarter of 2013, where it is offered in two trim lines. On 13 June 2013, Indonesia became the fourth official export market for the Prevé, where it is currently available in just one high-end variant. Proton unveiled the Prevé LE on 18 October 2013 in its domestic market, offering the 5-star ANCAP safety rated specifications of 6 airbags, ABS, BA, EBD, TCS and ESC in addition to leather seats and a special R3 bodykit, complemented by 17-inch R3 alloy rims. Only 100 units will be produced, with each retailing at RM79,688, or around RM7,000 more than the Prevé Premium trim.

2500|$|Electrification {{started in}} 1898, {{and most of}} the system was {{converted}} by 1910. An exception was the privately owned Parramatta line built by Charles Edward Jeanneret in 1881 to Redbank Wharf (Duck River) where the steam tram remained until 1943. Service began with C-class <b>saloon</b> <b>cars,</b> followed by D-class combination cars. In contrast to other cities that started with combination cars and toastracks, then quickly abandoned them for drop-centre and <b>saloon</b> <b>cars,</b> Sydney started by going the other way. Footboard trams continued to be introduced, notably E-class, K-class, and the double-bogie cars O-class and P-class trams required the conductor to collect fares from the footboard of the car, as those trams had no corridor. Revered though those trams were, they were deathtraps for conductors. On average, each day one conductor fell or was knocked off the footboard by passing motor vehicles. The majority suffered a fractured skull. In the three years 1923, 1924, 1925, there were 282, 289, and 233 accidents respectively to conductors on NSW tramways. From 1916 to 1932, there were 4,097 accidents to tram employees, and from 1923 to 1931 there were 10,228 accidents to passengers having falls when alighting or boarding. [...] 63 of the falls were fatal. [...] Of the more than 100 falls reported of conductors, one quarter died from their injuries. [...] It was not until the 1930s with the introduction of the R-class that the drop-centre saloon tram, widely used elsewhere in Australia, came to Sydney. Even so, footboard trams continued in wide use until the late 1950s, despite calls as early as 1934 by the tram union for them to be modified.|$|E
2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1968 a 1255 cc {{diesel engine}} option became {{available}} for the 204 estate and fourgonette (van) versions.

In April 1973 the diesel unit was increased in size to 1357 cc, and in September 1975 this diesel unit finally became an option on the 204 saloon. [...] Fuel economy on the 204 Diesel was startlingly good, with overall fuel consumption at 5.7 litres per 100km (roughly 41 mpgUS): [...] performance was correspondingly underwhelming with a claimed top speed of 130km/h (81mph). [...] Out of the approximately 150,000 diesel 204s produced, fewer than 30,000 were saloons. Until the early 1980s when Volkswagen started heavy promotion of their diesel-engined Golf / Rabbit, and unless cars were large enough to be used as taxis, most European customers for <b>saloon</b> <b>cars</b> avoided diesel engines.|$|E
