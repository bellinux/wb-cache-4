25|$|With {{millions}} of others I had prayed hard {{at the time of}} Dunkirk and never did prayer seem to be more speedily answered to the full. And we prayed for France and the next day she surrendered. I thought much, and when I went to bed I lay for a long time vividly awake. And I went over in my mind what had happened, concentrating on the thoughts that you had dwelt on, that prayer to be effective must be in accordance with God's will, and that by far the hardest thing to say from the heart and indeed the last lesson we learn (if we ever do) is to say and mean it, ‘Thy will be done.’ And I thought what mites we all are and how we can never see God's plan, a plan on such a scale that it must be incomprehensible. And suddenly for what must have been a couple of minutes I seemed to see with extraordinary and vivid clarity and to hear someone <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> The words at the time were clear, but the recollection of them had passed when I seemed to come to, as it were, but the sense remained, and the sense was this. ‘You cannot see the plan’; then ‘Have you not thought there is a purpose in stripping you one by one of all the human props on which you depend, that you are being left alone in the world? You have now one upon whom to lean and I have chosen you as my instrument to work with my will. Why then are you afraid?’ And to prove ourselves worthy of that tremendous task is our job.|$|E

500|$|Several of Edmondson's Holby City co-stars have {{described}} feeling {{intimidated by the}} prospect of working alongside him for the first time, stemming from his already well established fame. Rakie Ayola explained: [...] "I {{thought it was going to}} be difficult at the beginning because he wasn't <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> But he was initially just a little shy and sussing things out. He's a lot quieter than you would expect but then suddenly he'll say something that has everybody doubled up in laughter. You won't find anyone who doesn't like him." [...] Edmondson himself has added that he gets along well with the cast, although finds that the distance of Elstree Studios from most of their London homes makes them [...] "weirdly unsociable".|$|E

500|$|In 1990, Ralph Bakshi {{decided that}} it was time to make another {{animated}} film. According to Bakshi, [...] "I made 1,500 bucks in 10 years of painting; I thought it would be nice to pick up a piece of change. So I called my lawyer, who was still <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> because no one ever leaves Hollywood, and asked him where I should go to sell a movie." [...] Bakshi pitched Cool World to Paramount Pictures (where Bakshi had worked as the final head of the studio's animation division) as an animated horror film. The concept of the film involved a cartoon and live action human having sex and conceiving a hybrid child who visits the real world to murder the father who abandoned her. Bakshi states that Paramount Pictures [...] "bought the idea in ten seconds".|$|E

2500|$|It {{must have}} been late 1941 or early 1942. Jews were {{required}} to wear the Star of David and to obey a 6p.m. curfew. I had gone {{to play with a}} Christian friend and had stayed too late. I turned my brown sweater inside out to walk the few blocks home. As I was walking down an empty street, I saw a German soldier approaching. He was wearing the black uniform that I had been told to fear more than others – the one worn by specially recruited SS soldiers. As I came closer to him, trying to walk fast, I noticed that he was looking at me intently. Then he beckoned me over, picked me up, and hugged me. I was terrified that he would notice the star inside my sweater. He was <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> with great emotion, in German. When he put me down, he opened his wallet, showed me a picture of a boy, and gave me some money. I went home more certain than ever that my mother was right: people were endlessly complicated and interesting. (Kahneman, 2003, p. 417) ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{the king}} of the Franks [...] was on the hill with that band, they made a {{formidable}} charge against the Muslims facing them, so that they drove them back to my father [...] I looked towards him and he was overcome by grief and his complexion pale. He took hold of his beard and advanced, crying out [...] "Give the lie to the Devil!" [...] The Muslims rallied, returned to the fight and climbed the hill. When I saw that the Franks withdrew, pursued by the Muslims, I shouted for joy, [...] "We have beaten them!" [...] But the Franks rallied and charged again like the first time and drove the Muslims back to my father. He acted as he had done on the first occasion and the Muslims turned upon the Franks and drove them back to the hill. I again shouted, [...] "We have beaten them!" [...] but my father rounded on me and said, [...] "Be quiet! We have not beaten them until that tent [...] falls." [...] As he was <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> the tent fell. The sultan dismounted, prostrated himself in thanks to God Almighty and wept for joy.|$|E
2500|$|After {{collaborating with}} American female rapper Nicki Minaj on the song [...] "I'm Legit" [...] for Minaj's album , Minaj agreed {{to appear on}} Ciara's album in return. Originally, the duo had worked on just one {{collaboration}} for Ciara called [...] "I'm Out". Speaking about Minaj's version on the song, Ciara said [...] "The energy of the record is so dope, and it's really for the ladies, and Nicki she just killed the verse. She literally murdered it, like she got that throw-back, that thing that she does that's so special. She went in." [...] Having enjoyed the process Minaj said [...] "I was supposed to only do one song for her album and I think I'm {{going to end up}} doing two. I just love what she's doing and I'm so proud and I'm really excited for people to hear it." [...] In April, Ciara confirmed that Minaj was finished with a second record for the album; in an interview with MTV News, Ciara said, [...] "She's actually finishing up one now that's really it's a monster too. The moments that we have had so far have just been crazy. It's just been magical, it's been something special and I feel like the fans have always wanted to see she and I rock together." [...] In the end, Minaj also recorded vocals for the aforementioned [...] "Livin' It Up". On June 23, 2013, rapper, Future confirmed that the track, [...] "Where You Go", was originally recorded for his second studio album, Future Hendrix (2013); however, he gave it to Ciara, stating, [...] "She's like, 'I need this song.
