50|$|In {{addition}} to the aforementioned port hailing duties, the guns have had the task of firing a time signal since 1806. According to local tradition, the initial purpose of the gun was to allow ships in port to check the accuracy of their marine chronometers (a precision instrument used aboard ships to help calculate longitude). The gun report might be too inaccurate for ships several kilometers away {{if they did not}} correctly compensate for the relatively slow speed of sound.For this reason <b>ships</b> <b>marked</b> their time by the puff of smoke rather than the sound, and this is one reason the guns are sited high above Cape Town Harbour.|$|R

[...] One option would use a fairly small warhead but was intended to explode beneath the keel {{where there was no}} armor. This technology required the sophisticated new Mark 6 magnetic influence exploder, which was similar to the British Duplex and German models, all inspired by German magnetic mines of World War I.

However, due to unreliable shipping timetables, he found it hard to ship his lumber from the Pacific Northwest down the coast towards California. Hence, in 1893 Dollar bought a [...] steam schooner called Newsboy. This led to the establishment of the Dollar Steamship Company (commonly known as [...] "Dollar Line") on August 12, 1900, which soon grew to have a large fleet of schooners transporting lumber to market.|$|R
