Although if services were performed that were not agreed upon and no written and signed estimate was issued beforehand, a mechanic has no right to keep the title owner from reclaiming the vehicle. If a mechanic asserts a fee that is not reasonably related to the work performed, and refuses to return the vehicle until that price is paid, the owner of the vehicle will be able to recoup a <b>storage</b> <b>fee</b> from the mechanic, as the mechanic is in the wrong for refusing to return the vehicle.

Al Brenner, CEO of the Mutual Art Group, which includes APT, defended the new fee, arguing that the cost is much less than artists will have to pay elsewhere. He told Colin Gleadell of Artnet that “it’s not about raising money to balance our books; about getting the work out of storage {{so that it can be}} seen and eventually sold. Some works have been in storage for ten years and that’s not good.” According to Brenner, the appeal of APT for some artists was the free storage facilities. In order to become a member, one originally had to agree to contribute to the storage expenses for oversize works when signing the contract, but the policy has never been enforced.|$|E

A production-sales {{model is}} {{proposed}} for a model group company {{consisting of a}} manufacturing plant and a retail store. The present model covers the Make-to-Order and Make-to-Stock models. The customer demand for a product during a unit period fluctuates by a probability distribution. The retail store maintains some inventory storage in order to prepare for sales. If the inventory storage is insufficient, the retail store requests the manufacturing plant to supply additional volume, and the store may lose some profit because of a deficient yield {{in the number of}} customers willing to wait for the supply. The Make-to-Order model is based on a high customer yield and the Make-to-Stock model is based on a low inventory <b>storage</b> <b>fee.</b> The production sales profit of the model group company is formulated in terms of the following parameters: inventory <b>storage</b> <b>fee</b> and customer yield percentage. By maximizing the production sales profit, the problem of finding the amount of inventry storage yielding the most profit is solved. An index of "Propensity to Stock" is defined in the present production sales model. For a product with a positive propensity to stock, inventory storage of the product is favored to make the production-sales more profitable. On the other hand, for a product with a negative propensity to stock, production on demand for the product is favored. Thus, the propensity to stock for a particular product indicates whether a Production-Sales model, Make-to-Order model or Make-to-Stock model is the most profitable...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a retailer with limited storage capacity selling n independent products.

The retailer first sets a common revenue share for all products, and each manufacturer then determines the retail price and production quantity for his product. Under certain conditions on price elasticities and cost fractions, we find a unique optimal revenue share for all products. Surprisingly, it is optimal for the retailer not to charge any <b>storage</b> <b>fee</b> in many situations even if she is allowed to do so. Both the retailer’s and manufacturers’ profits first increase and then remain constant as the capacity increases, which implies that an optimal capacity exists.

If products are complementary, as the degree of complementarity increases, the retailer will decrease her revenue share to encourage the manufacturers to lower their prices...|$|E

40|$|To {{address the}} {{proliferation}} risk of separated plutonium, a technical and institutional design {{of an international}} plutonium storage system (IPSS) is presented. The IPSS is evaluated from two perspectives: its ability to address the proliferation risk of excess civilian inventories, {{and its ability to}} reduce the threat from excess Russian military plutonium. A systems dynamic model of global plutonium inventories projects a capacity requirement for an IPSS of 450 to 600 MT. A conceptual design of a representative 100 MT storage facility was shown to meet criticality safety requirements for a range of operational and accident scenarios. From an institutional perspective, a hybrid organizational structure drawing on rganizational features of the United Nations Security Council and the International Atomic Energy Agency is proposed as a model for system participation and governance. For political and nonproliferation reasons, a multiple-site arrangement for the IPSS is recommended. The following locations are identified as potential IPSS sites: Savannah River (U. S.), Mayak (Russia), La Hague (France), and Rokkasho (Japan). A set of rules governing material ownership and release conditions is also proposed. Intrinsic barriers to the proliferation of plutonium of the type envisioned by the "spent fuel standard" will not be achieved for many years. In the meantime, primary reliance must be placed on extrinsic barriers. (cont.) The effectiveness of an IPSS would derive mainly from the extrinsic (institutional) barriers to proliferation it would provide. An IPSS would significantly enhance the proliferation resistance of global plutonium inventories. Several hurdles to IPSS implementation are identified, and a proposal for implementing the IPSS in Russia is described. The total life-cycle cost of an IPSS is estimated at $ 9 billion (in 2000 dollars). The cost to the U. S. of addressing the excess military plutonium problem with an IPSS strategy is estimated at $ 2. 9 billion, or $ 4. 2 billion if the U. S. covers Russian costs as well. Several financing options are identified. A lifetime-levelized plutonium <b>storage</b> <b>fee</b> of ~$ 900 /kg-year would be sufficient to recover the full life-cycle cost of the IPSS. by Eugene Bae. Thesis (Ph. D.)
