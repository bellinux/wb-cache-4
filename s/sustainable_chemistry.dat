40|$|International audienceDue to {{its success}} {{in the domain of}} power electronics, the lithium ion battery {{technology}} is currently being considered for electric vehicle propulsion and even electric grid storage. 1, 2 However, the implementation of a lithium based technology on a large scale faces controversial debates on lithium availability and cost. Alternative lower cost and <b>sustainable</b> <b>chemistries</b> would be specially suited for large scale applications even if they involve a penalty in energy density. The most appealing alternative is to use sodium, instead of lithium. Indeed, it exhibits a rich intercalation chemistry 3, 4 and its resources are in principle unlimited (high concentrations in seawater) being very easy to recuperate. Sodium technology has already been successfully implemented in today's commercialized high-temperature Na/S cells for MW storage and for Na/NiCl 2 ZEBRA-type systems for electric vehicles, both of which take advantage of the highly conducting solid beta-alumina ceramics at temperatures of ca. 300 C. Mindful of these considerations, and within the current knowledge gained in Li-ion technology, a room temperature analogous Na-ion cell is a realistic target. If achieved, it would bring about a radical decrease in cost with respect to lithium ion technology while ensuring sustainability...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} Ph. D {{work was}} mainly focused on catalysis, {{as a key}} technology, to achieve the objectives of <b>sustainable</b> (green) <b>chemistry.</b> After introducing the concepts of <b>sustainable</b> (green) <b>chemistry</b> and an assessment of new sustainable chemical technologies, the relationship between catalysis and <b>sustainable</b> (green) <b>chemistry</b> was briefly discussed and illustrated via an analysis of some selected and relevant examples. Afterwards, as {{a continuation of the}} ongoing interest in Dr. Marco Bandini’s group on organometallic and organocatalytic processes, I addressed my efforts to the design and development of novel catalytic green methodologies for the synthesis of enantiomerically enriched molecules. In the first two projects the attention was focused on the employment of solid supports to carry out reactions that still remain a prerogative of omogeneous catalysis. Firstly, particular emphasis was addressed to the discovery of catalytic enantioselective variants of nitroaldol condensation (commonly termed Henry reaction), using a complex consisting in a polyethylene supported diamino thiopene (DATx) ligands and copper as active species. In the second project, a new class of electrochemically modified surfaces with DATx palladium complexes was presented. The DATx-graphite system proved to be efficient in promoting the Suzuki reaction. Moreover, in collaboration with Prof. Wolf at the University of British Columbia (Vancouver), cyclic voltammetry studies were reported. This study disclosed new opportunities for carbon–carbon forming processes by using heterogeneous, electrodeposited catalyst films. A straightforward metal-free catalysis allowed the exploration around the world of organocatalysis. In fact, three different and novel methodologies, using Cinchona, Guanidine and Phosphine derivatives, were envisioned in the three following projects. An interesting variant of nitroaldol condensation with simple trifluoromethyl ketones and also their application in a non-conventional activation of indolyl cores by Friedel-Crafts-functionalization, led to two novel synthetic protocols. These approaches allowed the preparation of synthetically useful trifluoromethyl derivatives bearing quaternary stereocenters. Lastly, in the sixth project the first γ-alkylation of allenoates with conjugated carbonyl compounds was envisioned. In the last part of this Ph. D thesis bases on an extra-ordinary collaboration with Prof. Balzani and Prof. Gigli, I was involved in the synthesis and characterization of a new type of heteroleptic cyclometaled-Ir(III) complexes, bearing bis-oxazolines (BOXs) as ancillary ligands. The new heteroleptic complexes were fully characterized and in order to examine the electroluminescent properties of FIrBOX(CH 2), an Organic Light Emitting Device was realized. ...|$|R

40|$|Reversible dendrite-free low-areal-capacity lithium metal {{electrodes}} {{have recently}} been revived, because of their pivotal role in developing beyond lithium ion batteries. However, {{there have been no}} reports of reversible dendrite-free high-areal-capacity lithium metal electrodes. Here we report on a strategy to realize unprecedented stable cycling of lithium electrodeposition/stripping with a highly desirable areal-capacity (12 mAhcm(- 2)) and exceptional Coulombic efficiency (> 99. 98 %) at high current densities (> 5 mAcm(- 2)) and ambient temperature using a diluted solvate ionic liquid. The essence of this strategy, that can drastically improve lithium electrodeposition kinetics by cyclic voltammetry premodulation, lies in the tailoring of the top solid-electrolyte interphase layer in a diluted solvate ionic liquid to facilitate a two-dimensional growth mode. We anticipate that this discovery could pave the way for developing reversible dendrite-free metal anodes for <b>sustainable</b> battery <b>chemistries...</b>|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} field in <b>sustainable</b> industrial <b>chemistry</b> {{is the development}} of new applications for fats and oils. One of the promising applications is the use of fatty acid derivatives, e. g. dicarboxylic acid (DCA), as polymer building blocks. In contrast to conventional plastics, bioplastics are polymers derived from renewable biomass sources. In addition to their contribution to the conservation of fossil resources and reduction in CO 2 emissions by waste incineration, many bioplastics are biodegradable. The majority of industrial DCA production for polyamide (PA) and polyester (PE) synthesis is still done via chemical synthesis. While short-chain DCA can be synthesized in high yields, costs of long-chain DCA production rise significantly due to the generation of various by-products and are connected mostly to a costly purification. Thus biotechnology provides novel biochemical approaches for long-chain DCA synthesis that can provide an eco-efficient process alternative. In the present article, strategies for the development of high-level production strains for long-chain DCA are illustrated. Basic strategies for strain development, in order to achieve an effective enrichment of DCA, require the knowledge of the respective biochemical pathways. These are discussed in detail. Furthermore an overview of fermentation strategies and characteristics of corresponding polymers is given...|$|R
