50|$|Empirical {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} alternative <b>stable</b> <b>states</b> is vital to advancing the idea beyond theory. Schröder et al. (2005) reviewed the current ecological literature for alternative <b>stable</b> <b>states</b> and found 35 direct experiments, of which only 21 were deemed valid. Of these, 62% (14) showed {{evidence for}} and 38% (8) showed no evidence for alternative <b>stable</b> <b>states.</b> However, the Schröder et al. (2005) analysis required evidence of hysteresis, which is not necessarily a prerequisite for alternative <b>stable</b> <b>states.</b> Other authors (e.g., Scheffer et al. 2001; Folke et al. 2004) have had less-stringent requirements for the documentation of alternative <b>stable</b> <b>states.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of multiple <b>stable</b> <b>states</b> has far-reaching consequences for a system's susceptibility to disturbances, including {{the possibility of}} abrupt transitions between <b>stable</b> <b>states.</b> The occurrence of multiple <b>stable</b> <b>states</b> of vegetation is supported by ecological theory, models, and observations. Here we describe the occurrence of multiple <b>stable</b> <b>states</b> of tree cover in a global dynamic vegetation model and provide the first global picture on multiple <b>stable</b> <b>states</b> of tree cover due to a fire-vegetation feedback. The multiple <b>stable</b> <b>states</b> occur in the transition zones between grasslands and forests, mainly in Africa and Asia. By sensitivity simulations and simplifying the relevant model equations we show that the occurrence of multiple states {{is caused by the}} sensitivity of the fire disturbance rate to the {{presence of}} woody plant types. <br/...|$|R
50|$|Verifying the {{existence}} of alternative <b>stable</b> <b>states</b> carries profound implications for ecosystem management. If <b>stable</b> <b>states</b> exist, gradual changes in environmental factors may have little effect on a system until a threshold is reached, at which point a catastrophic state shift may occur. Understanding {{the nature of these}} thresholds will help inform the design of monitoring programs, ecosystem restoration, and other management decisions. Managers are particularly interested in the potential of hysteresis, since {{it may be difficult to}} recover from a state shift (Beisner et al. 2003). The mechanisms of feedback loops that maintain <b>stable</b> <b>states</b> are important to understand if we hope to effectively manage an ecosystem with alternative <b>stable</b> <b>states.</b>|$|R

5|$|By {{the late}} 19th century {{scientists}} realized that air could be liquefied and its components isolated by compressing and cooling it. Using a cascade method, Swiss chemist and physicist Raoul Pierre Pictet evaporated liquid sulfur dioxide {{in order to}} liquefy carbon dioxide, which in turn was evaporated to cool oxygen gas enough to liquefy it. He sent a telegram on December 22, 1877 to the French Academy of Sciences in Paris announcing his discovery of liquid oxygen. Just two days later, French physicist Louis Paul Cailletet announced his own method of liquefying molecular oxygen. Only {{a few drops of}} the liquid were produced in each case and no meaningful analysis could be conducted. Oxygen was liquified in a <b>stable</b> <b>state</b> {{for the first time on}} March 29, 1883 by Polish scientists from Jagiellonian University, Zygmunt Wróblewski and Karol Olszewski.|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of alternate <b>stable</b> <b>states</b> on coral reefs has been disputed, {{although there is}} universal agreement that many reefs have experienced substantial losses of coral cover. Alternate <b>stable</b> <b>states</b> require a strong positive feedback that causes self-reinforcing runaway change when a threshold is passed. Here we use a simple model {{of the dynamics of}} corals, macroalgae and herbivores to illustrate that even weak positive feedbacks that individually cannot lead to alternate <b>stable</b> <b>states</b> can nonetheless do so if they act in concert and reinforce each other. Since the strength of feedbacks varies over time and space, our results imply that we should not reject or accept the general hypothesis that alternate <b>stable</b> <b>states</b> occur in coral reefs. Instead, it is plausible that shifts between alternate <b>stable</b> <b>states</b> can occur sporadically, or on some reefs but not others depending on local conditions. Therefore, we should aim at a better mechanistic understanding of when and why alternate <b>stable</b> <b>states</b> may occur. Our modelling results point to an urgent need to recognize, quantify, and understand feedbacks, and to reorient management interventions to focus more on the mechanisms that cause abrupt transitions between alternate states. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{alternative}} <b>stable</b> <b>states</b> {{has long been}} a dominant framework for studying the influence of historical contingency in community assembly. This concept focuses on <b>stable</b> <b>states,</b> yet many real communities are kept in a transient state by disturbance, and the utility of predictions for <b>stable</b> <b>states</b> in explaining transient states remains unclear. Using a simple model of plant community assembly, we show that the conditions under which historical contingency affects community assembly can differ greatly for <b>stable</b> versus transient <b>states.</b> Differences arise because the contribution of such factors as mortality rate, environmental heterogeneity and plant-soil feedback to historical contingency changes as community assembly proceeds. We also show that transient states can last for a long time relative to immigration rate and generation time. These results argue for a conceptual shift of focus from alternative <b>stable</b> <b>states</b> to alternative transient states for understanding historical contingency in community assembly...|$|R
5|$|High-energy gamma-ray photons {{initially}} released with fusion {{reactions in}} the core are almost immediately absorbed by the solar plasma of the radiative zone, usually after traveling only a few millimeters. Re-emission happens in a random direction and usually at a slightly lower energy. With this sequence of emissions and absorptions, {{it takes a long}} time for radiation to reach the Sun's surface. Estimates of the photon travel time range between 10,000 and 170,000years. In contrast, it takes only 2.3 seconds for the neutrinos, which account for about 2% of the total energy production of the Sun, to reach the surface. Because energy transport in the Sun is a process that involves photons in thermodynamic equilibrium with matter, the time scale of energy transport in the Sun is longer, on the order of 30,000,000 years. This is the time it would take the Sun to return to a <b>stable</b> <b>state,</b> if the rate of energy generation in its core were suddenly changed.|$|E
5|$|Rutherfordium is {{the first}} transactinide element and the second member of the 6d series of {{transition}} metals. Calculations on its ionization potentials, atomic radius, as well as radii, orbital energies, and ground levels of its ionized states are {{similar to that of}} hafnium and very different from that of lead. Therefore, it was concluded that rutherfordium's basic properties will resemble those of other group 4 elements, below titanium, zirconium, and hafnium. Some of its properties were determined by gas-phase experiments and aqueous chemistry. The oxidation state +4 is the only <b>stable</b> <b>state</b> for the latter two elements and therefore rutherfordium should also exhibit a stable +4 state. In addition, rutherfordium is also expected to be able to form a less stable +3 state. The standard reduction potential of the Rf4+/Rf couple is predicted to be higher than −1.7V.|$|E
5|$|Through intrigue, Thảo {{also helped}} destabilise and {{ultimately}} unseat two South Vietnamese regimes—Diem's {{and the military}} junta of Khánh. As the Diệm regime began to unravel in 1963, Thảo {{was one of the}} officers planning a coup. His plot was ultimately integrated into the successful plot and his activities promoted infighting which weakened the government and distracted the military from fighting the Viet Cong insurgency. Throughout 1964 and 1965, as South Vietnam was struggling to establish a <b>stable</b> <b>state</b> after the ouster of Diệm, Thảo was involved in several intrigues and coup plots which diverted the government from implementing its programs. In 1965, he went into hiding after a failed attempt to seize power from Khánh and was sentenced to death in absentia. Although this coup also failed, the subsequent chaos forced Khánh's junta to collapse. Thảo died the same year he was forced into hiding; it is believed that he was murdered after a bounty was placed on his head. After Vietnam was reunified {{at the end of the}} Vietnam War, the victorious communists claimed Thảo as one of their own and posthumously made him a one-star general.|$|E

5|$|Livermorium is {{projected}} to be the fourth member of the 7p series of chemical elements and the heaviest member of group 16 in the periodic table, below polonium. While it is the least theoretically studied of the 7p elements, its chemistry {{is expected to be}} quite similar to that of polonium. The group oxidation state of +6 is known for all the chalcogens apart from oxygen which lacks available d-orbitals for expansion of its octet and is itself one of the strongest oxidizing agents among the chemical elements. Oxygen is thus limited to a maximum +2 state, exhibited in the fluoride OF2. The +4 state is known for sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and polonium, undergoing a shift in stability from reducing for sulfur(IV) and selenium(IV) through being the most <b>stable</b> <b>state</b> for tellurium(IV) to being oxidizing in polonium(IV). This suggests a decreasing stability for the higher oxidation states as the group is descended due to the increasing importance of relativistic effects, especially the inert pair effect. The most stable oxidation state of livermorium should thus be +2, with a rather unstable +4 state. The +2 state should be about as easy to form as it is for beryllium and magnesium, and the +4 state should only be achieved with strongly electronegative ligands, such as in livermorium(IV) fluoride (LvF4). The +6 state should not exist at all due to the very strong stabilization of the 7s electrons, making the valence core of livermorium only four electrons. The lighter chalcogens are also known to form a −2 state as oxide, sulfide, selenide, telluride, and polonide; due to the destabilization of livermorium's 7p3/2 subshell, the −2 state should be very unstable for livermorium, whose chemistry should be essentially cationic, though the larger subshell and spinor energy splittings of livermorium as compared to polonium should stabilize Lv2− slightly.|$|E

Basing ourselves on a mathematical result published earlier, we propose an algorithm to construct a negative feedback on the parameter which induces a Shilnikov or Lorenz type of chaos by building of homoclinic orbits. The algorithm is robust against variations of parameters and numerical uncertainty. One outcome is, for instance, in the Lorenz type of situation, trajectories visiting, in a chaotic order, neighborhoods of four given <b>stable</b> <b>states</b> of the initial system. We illustrate the results on the three-variables Goodwin model with negative regulation. The second class of results presented here apply to a wider class of systems.
