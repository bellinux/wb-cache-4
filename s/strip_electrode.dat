Copper cladding of mild steel substrates by deposition from <b>strip</b> <b>electrodes</b> using the submerged arc welding process has been successful. A wide range of parameters, and several fluxes have been investigated. The range of deposit compositions is 66. 4 % Cu to 95. 7 % Cu. The weld beads have been metallographically examined using optical and electron microscopy. Equating weld beads to a thermodynamical equivalent of iron {{has proven to be}} an accurate and simplified means of handling quantitative data for multicomponent welds. Empirical equations derived using theoretical considerations characterize the weld bead dimensions as functions of the welding parameters and hence composition. The melting rate for <b>strip</b> <b>electrodes</b> is dependent upon the current-voltage product. Weld nugget size is increased by increased thermal transfer efficiencies resulting from stirring which is current dependent. The presence of Fe 2 O 3 in a flux has been demonstrated to diminish electrode melting rate and drastically increase penetration, making flux choice the prime consideration in cladding operations.

Increasing the thickness and decreasing the width of the <b>strip</b> <b>electrode</b> (60 ´ 0, 5 mm, 45 ´ 0, 7 mm, 30 ´ 1, 0 mm) results in the changing of the shape and dimensions of the fusion zone of the base metal to enhance the depth and reduce the non-uniformity of fusion penetration.

40|$|The {{use of the}} <b>strip</b> <b>electrode</b> when {{surfacing}} is made along {{a variable}} path leads {{to a change in}} the melting process and the formation of a weld bead, due to the absence, in contrast to the wire electrode, of the axial symmetry of the strip cross section. In the layered surfacing of mill rolls with the rollers being at an angle to the generatrix, there may be such defects as undercuts and slagging along the edges of the seam, that worsen the quality and performance of the wear resistant layer. According to the results of the metallographic analysis of the sections, it has been established that these defects in the seam at the cross-over of the rolls during the layer-by-layer surfacing are not remelted by the arc and it leads to slag inclusions in the zone. There is an asymmetry {{in the formation of the}} weld pool, which is associated with the peculiarities of the liquid metal flow during its melting. Thus, a decrease in the minimum deviation angle of the <b>strip</b> <b>electrode</b> location with respect to the deposition rate vector leads to a decrease in the crack resistance of the working surface. Investigations of the weld bead formation during deposition by a <b>strip</b> <b>electrode</b> as a function of the angle of the strip rotation with respect to the deposition rate vector have been performed. The influence of the change in the angle of rotation of the <b>strip</b> <b>electrode</b> on the uniformity of the fusion line with the parent metal formation was studied. The allowable range of strip angle values has been determined, which ensures the quality and operability of the wear-resistant layer, as well as the absence of formation defects.

All temperature measurements were performed on an Ad-Tech® <b>Strip</b> <b>Electrode.</b> Different cables and components were connected in different setups and were then positioned systematically in different distances to the MRI scanner wall to examine heating of the electrodes. For this, a Spin Echo sequence and an Echo Planar Imaging sequence were performed. Results Strongest heating of the <b>strip</b> <b>electrode</b> was measured at the most distal of the single electrodes. In the Spin Echo sequence, heating generally above recommended safety limits were measured. Single exception was the <b>strip</b> <b>electrode</b> positioned in the isocentre without any other components.

40|$|AbstractElectrical {{discharge}} machining (EDM) {{is a widespread}} machining method for the die and mold industry. This method can machine all conductive materials, including hard-to-cut metals, because the machining process uses electro-thermal energy without a cutting force. During EDM, discharge sparks remove not only the material of a workpiece but also the material of an electrode. This machining mechanism thereby causes electrode wear, which creates serious problems, including make-shape errors and low productivity. In order to overcome such problems, a new EDM method using a <b>strip</b> <b>electrode</b> (strip EDM) was developed in this study. Strip EDM uses a continuously applied <b>strip</b> <b>electrode</b> similar to the wire electrode in wire EDM. In the suggested strip-electrode method, a conductive strip moves on the electrode guide. The worn strip is removed, and a new one is supplied continuously. Therefore, the tool electrode acquires no wear during the machining process. This method uses a conductive strip that is made of brass. In the practical machining process, the strip EDM method was applied to EDM milling and EDM turning and their machining characteristics were compared with general EDM methods...|$|E

Using the ring electrode, the minimum restriking voltage dropped to about 30 % (100 V) at commercial frequencies and about 90 % (215 V) at 500 Hz as compared with the normal type-Using the <b>strip</b> <b>electrode,</b> the minimum restriking voltage dropped to less than about 30 % (100 V) at commercial frequencies and less than 50 % (120 V) at high frequencies as compared with the normal type. Generaly, the starting voltage decreases as the preheating current increases, but the degree of preheating current region between 300 mA and 350 mA is neccesary to accelerate the starting. It is thought that the effect of the starting auxiliary electrodes resultes essentially in shortening of the electrode gap. When the reflector was earthed, the starting characteristics were not affected by the earthing effect for the <b>strip</b> <b>electrode,</b> but those were made random by the earthing effect for the ring electrode.
