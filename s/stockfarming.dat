40|$|The government, <b>stockfarming</b> and veterinarians {{signed a}} convenant in 2008 {{to reduce the}} use of {{antibiotics}} in the Netherlands. The dairy farms will have to reduce their use of antibiotics as well. In this sector the most antibiotics are used for the udder but there’s also almost twenty percent applied orally to the mildrinking calves. The objective {{of this study was}} 1) a literature study to the management rules and the treatment of diarrhea within the group of milkdrinking calves and 2) to investigate if management differs between farms with a high and a low use of antibiotics. In this way it will become clear where the management can be improved and thereby the use of antibiotics can be reduced. In the region of Utrecht 62 farms were visited to fill out a questionnaire, 31 low antibiotic use farms with a daily dosage per animal year between 1, 5 and 3, 5 and 31 high antibiotic use farms with a daily dosage per animal year between 7, 2 and 14, 7. Questions were asked about the general management of calf rearing like the supplementation of colostrum, hygiene and the treatment of diarrhea. There after young stock and housing were visually inspected and hygiene scores were conducted. The results were analyzed and compared to the general rules of calf rearing and to the antibiotics use of the farms. General calf management did not reach the rules on many of the 62 farms. For example, only 49 % of the farms had the right hygiene measures, on 63 % of the farms colostrum is given within 30 minutes and on 58 % of the farms calves were fed with antibiotic milk. The high and low antibiotic use groups showed no differences between herd size and milk production level. The high antibiotic use farms showed significant better calf rearing management concerning hygiene of the maternity barn and the calf hutches. High antibiotic use farms gave significantly more often colostrum within 30 minutes and vaccinated against Rota Corona virus against non of the low antibiotic use farms. Although the largest part of the famers act according to the literature rules, a lot of improvement can be accomplished in optimizing young stock rearing. It seems that farms with a high antibiotic use have a better calf rearing management then the low antibiotic users. This finding could be {{explained by the fact that}} high antibiotic user farmers seem to be more alert and pro-active in their management than low antibiotics user farmers. It is not known whether this relation is causative or just an effect...|$|E
40|$|After the {{agricultural}} activities, livestock {{is one of}} the oldest economic activity with the settlement of humanbeings This typeof activity is shaped and continues to develop according to geographical features of the land. Landforms and vegetation are the two biggest factors affecting the distribution of cattle and sheep in our country. As it isknown, making goat farming are common in the areas where landforms are rugged and mountainous, agricultural land is limitedand maquis vegetation is common. The barbels which can move and adapt quickly is more common in hilly and sloping terrain. However, in the plain areas where agricultural land increased, the number of barbels is decreasing. Because, the goats that canadapt all kinds of terrain prefer feeding in forests and hilly areas instead of flat land. In the rugged landforms where steppe vegetation is seen, sheep farming is common. However, as the steppe vegetation is notseen in coastal parts of our country, sheep farming is common in limited land which scrub vegetation becomes sparse. As sheepgrown for wool, ıt can not be comfortable in areas where the scrub bushes are seen. But, for the preventation of destroyingforests due to the goats, raising sheep is encouraged instead of raising goat. While this situation reduces the number of goat, itincreases the number of sheep in our country. Cattle farming are common in areas where landforms are plain in our country and the vegetation is meadow and grassland. Inthese areas, dairy farms that enterprise milk and milk products are developing. Even if it is decresing day by day, farming pack animal is still going on in the areas where the land, is piecemeal, poor andunsuitable for motoculture. These animals are utilized to carry load in narrow roads and paths. In this article by examining the distribution of cattle and sheep presence in the villages of Silifke, the effects of landforms andvegetation on the distribution are discussed. There are 74 villages located in the field of research. The area is surrounded byErdemli, on the east; Mut and Gülnar on the west; and Karaman and Mediterranean Sea on the North. The main morphological units of this research area are the mountainous areas that are formed by the Central Toros and theareas that fall out as a result of erosion. (low and high plateaus) % 89 of the area is mountianous and % 11 of it contains grassyplains. The declivity and height increases when you are away from the sea. Due to the geological formation of the land, the flow rate of rain is low. The rain water reaches the sea by leaking from thecracks and cavities. Aksıfat watercourse has this feature. The number of seasonal watercourses rises because of the irregularrainfall. In this area, Göksu is the biggest river, spring of which is near Ermenek. Generally, Göksu River takes nourisment notonly rainfall, but it is also nourished with melting snow near Ermenek and Mut. The flow of the river that increases in winter time,is at the top in March and April. The flow is at the bottom in July and September. The district has the biggest lakes of Mersin. Akgöl that is in Göksu Delta is 1200 hectare and Paradeniz is 350 hectare. The water of Akgöl is soft that takes nourisment fromdrainage channels by pouring its water to Paradeniz. Mediterranean climate is effective in this area. In the district that Mediterranean climate is dominant, the situation changesdepending on the increment of height. Average temperature is about c° 19 and the amount of average rain fall is 572, 2 mm. According to Thornthwaite’s climateclassification 100 (C 2 B 2 S 2 b 4) climate type that is familiar with the influence of ocean is seen (dry-a little moist-at the averagetemperature and water rate is over in winter time). Terra rossa usually lies in the research area. In the areas where the vegetation is rich Brown soil type, in declivitous hillsidescolluvial type of soil and at the bottom of Göksu Valley alluvium type are seen. In addition the red pine forests in the research area, ın the grounds that red pines destroy the shrubs are widespread. As theheight rises the vegetation begins to change and torch pines, cedars and firs are seen. According to 2007 population cencus, the total population of Silifke is 111 698. 52 961 of these people live in the city centreand 58 737 of this population live in towns and villages. % 47. 4 of the total population is in the urban area and % 52. 6 of it is inrural area. In this area there is a city. There are 8 towns and 66 villages and totally there are 75 stable centre of population. Settlement in plateaus are exremely common as a result of animal husbandry and conditions of climate. There are 19 plateaus inthe district. The existence of cattle and sheep and goats spreads under the effect of land forms and vegetation. In the district as the land isdeclivitous and hilly, in the areas where the land is limited the barbels are raised. Barbel raising is banned in the forest, near theforest and in villages on the hillsides as the barbels damage the forests. While the number of barbels is declining day by day, thenumber of sheep is increasing. Cattle raising appears in grandlands while sheep and goats are rare in the flat areas like GöksuPlain. Pack animals and mounts are raised in the areas where the declivity is excessive, {{the agricultural}} lands are restricted and pullinto pieces. According to 2007 data, the total number of cattle, sheep and goat is 108 371. While % 88. 7 (96 167) of these animals aresheep and goats, % 11. 3 (12 204) of them are cattles. The sheep and goats are numerous in the mountainous parts of the district and in the lands that maquis is seen. However theexistence of cattles are dense in grasslands of Göksu Plain. There are 96 167 sheep and goats in the research area according to 2007 data. % 75, 5 (72 612) of the sheep and goats arebarbels,% 24, 5 (23 555) of them are sheepRaising barbels which is traditional and common in the research area {{is one of the}} most important means of livelihood. In the lands where the landforms are mountanious and rugged, the amount of land is limited and where maquis is seen raisingbarbels is pervasive. Generally, as a result of increment of height on the West and on the North of the area, the rate of rasingbarbels is increasing, too. One of the features of this area where raising barbels is of a high percentage that the agriculturalactivities are done as a dry land farming. Namely, there is a problem of watering in these areas. Generally, the existence of barbels is dense in the villages of the area on the North. The existence of barbels is significantlylow as the land is flat and the agricultural doings are important in the villages of Göksu Plain. Morever, in the villages where thenumber of barbels is not much, the maquis isn’t seen. Totaly, there are 12 204 cattles in the district. % 91 (11 084) of the cattles are cows, % 4 (530) of them are horses, % 3 (381) ofthem are donkeys, % 2 (209) of them are mules. The cows have the biggest share all of the cattles’ rate. The cows that are raised for milk and meat are the animals fed mostly. In the areas where the roughness is less, and thegrasslands are common <b>stockfarming</b> is widespread (especially on the settlements on Göksu Plain). Besides this crops that aregrown in the plain are used for as cattle cake. This encourages <b>stockfarming.</b> In the research area where the roughness and declivity is excessive, the lands are limited and small, and the land is not suitablefor motoculture, mounts are raised. Despite the number of them is declining day by day, mounts are benefited from ploughing inthe lands where tractors and other vehicles can’t work and carrying load in the narrow roads and paths. Horses; mules anddonkeys are the mounts that are mostly fed...|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} a survey aimed at testing the {{hypothesis}} that the lichen Evernia prunastri, when transplanted in an agricultural area with high atmospheric NH(3) concentrations, would respond to NH(3) air pollution accumulating nitrogen in its thalli and showing changes in the concentration of assimilation pigments are presented. The results confirmed the hypothesis and showed that all lichen transplants accumulated nitrogen, suggesting that besides the release of atmospheric ammonia by animal <b>stockfarms,</b> the use of N-based fertilizers and the deposition of N-rich dust also may contribute to the high nitrogen availability to lichens in the study area. The result indicated that in the study area both the critical level of NH(3) and the critical load of N for lichens are exceeded and physiological damage is to be expected in sensitive species. The {{results of a}}ssimilation pigments in E. prunastri, with a decrease in the concentration of chlorophylls a and b and carotenoids, as well as chlorophyll degradation to phaeophytin, confirmed this hypothesis.

40|$|The present {{research}} work had two objectives. First {{to study the}} lesions in sheep of greek <b>stockfarms</b> naturally infected with lentivirus of sheep {{and especially in the}} likely to be affected target-organs (lungs, central nervous system, mammary glands, joint capsules, mediastinal and mammary lymph nodes, kidneys, myocardium) of the ovine progressive pneumonia-encephalomyelitis (O. P. P. E.). The aim of this task was to evaluate and compare the severity and proportion of the lesions detected in the above organs of sheep of greek flocks during the clinical but mainly in the subclinical phase of the disease. The knowledge regarding the progress and proportion of the histological lesions during the subclinical phase of the disease is limited, {{despite the fact that the}} latter is the prevailing condition in infected flocks of sheep. The second objective was to evaluate the severity and the proportion of lesions in the various target-organs during the natural lentivirus infection of sheep in animals of mainly greek breeds but also in offspring of their crosses, since the breed of sheep appears to be one of the factors that influence the picture of the lesions. A serological examination of 160 sheep was carried out with two methods, Agar Gel Immuno Diffusion Test (AGID) and the indirect Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (i- ELISA); the animals originated from <b>stockfarms</b> of northern and central Greece with a positive history of the disease. The likely to be affected target-organs or systems of 121 of these sheep were examined histopathologically. Eighty out of 121 sheep were seropositive by both serological assays, 9 were positive by AGID but negative by i-ELISA, 18 were positive by i- ELISA and negative by AGID, while 14 were seronegative by both assays and were used as controls. Out of 107 sheep that were positive by at least one of the two assays, 23 sheep (percentage 21, 5 %) exhibited some clinical signs, while all the rest were asymptomatic carriers in the subclinical phase of the disease. The 80 sheep positive by both serological assays were of the following genotypes: a) Crossbreds - 17 sheep, b) East Friesland breed - 13 sheep, c) Karagouniki breed - 22 sheep, d) Chios breed - 10 sheep, e) Kimi breed - 10 sheep, f) Serres breed- 3 sheep, g) Zante breed - 3 sheep, h) Scopelos breed - 2 sheep. The examination of the 80 seropositive sheep (by both assays used), revealed that the main target-organs in declining order of occurrence of lesions were as follows: 1. lungs -percentage 94 %, 2. central nervous system -percentage 80 % 3. mammary glands -percentage 67 % 4. joints -percentage 21 %. According to the incidence and severity of lesions detected in the lungs, they were the main target-organ, that is in agreement with the usual clinical signs observed in greek sheep flocks (predominance of the respiratory form of the disease). High percentage of histological lesions caused by the disease (O. P. P. E.) was detected in the central nervous system, with predominant lesion the focal and diffuse gliosis. All sheep genotypes that were examined and were positive by both serological assays revealed histological lesions of O. P. P. E. in one at least target-organ and in a case percentage 100 %; they were therefore all equally sensitive to the occurrence of lesions due to the disease. The incidence of lesions in each target-organ or system in the different genotypes of sheep positive by both serological assays, was in a declining order as follows: Mammary glands: 1. Karagouniki breed (100 %), 2. Chios breed (80 %), 3. Kimi breed (70 %) 4. Crossbreds (44 %), 5. East Friesland breed (8 %). Lungs: 1. East Friesland breed (100 %), 2. Karagouniki breed (95 %), 3. Crossbreds (94 %), 4. Chios breed and Kimi breed (90 %). Central Nervous System: 1. Crossbreds (94 %), 2. East Friesland breed (92 %), 3. Chios breed (90 %), 4. Kimi breed (80 %), 5. Karagouniki breed (59 %). Joints: 1. Crossbreds (47 %), 2. Chios breed (30 %), 3. Karagouniki breed (23 %), 4. Kimi breed (10 %), 5. East Friesland breed (0 %). This priority order corresponded also to the degree of sensitivity of each genotype to the occurrence of histological lesions of the disease O. P. P. E. in every target-organ. With regard to the topographical localization of lesions of seropositive with both serological assays animals (in the clinical and mainly the subclinical phase of the disease), the various sections transversely to the longitudinal axis of the central nervous system according to the incidence of lesions in them, could be put in a declining order as follows: 1. Frontal cortex rostral to the corpus callosum (percentage 60 %). 2. Diencephalon at the hypophyseal infundibulum-optic tract levels (percentage 59 %). 3. Diencephalon at the mammilary body (percentage 54 %) 4. Mesencephalon through the rostral colliculi just posterior to the pineal body (percentage 51 %). 5. Medulla at the obex (percentage 32 %). 6. Middle transverse section of the cerebellum from the fissure prima to the middle peduncles (percentage 19 %). 7. Cervical region of the spinal cord (percentage 19 %). 8. Medulla at the caudal cerebellar peduncles including the trapezoidal body (percentage 15 %). 9. Middle of the pons (percentage 10 %). In choroid plexuses as well as in the leptomeninges the percentage of lesions was 22, 5 %. The two serological assays that were used in this study were examined for their sensitivity and specificity according to the histopathological picture observed. The AGID was found to be less sensitive but more specific than ELISA for the diagnosis of the disease. ...|$|R
