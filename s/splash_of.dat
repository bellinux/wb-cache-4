5|$|Before its {{purchase}} by the Amon Carter Museum of American Art, The Swimming Hole {{appears to}} have undergone seven different conservatory treatments. It may have been restored prior to its inclusion in Eakins' memorial exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1917. A photograph from that time reveals cracks in the glazes and a drip mark, possibly caused by the <b>splash</b> <b>of</b> a caustic liquid. After the painting was acquired by the Fort Worth Art Association, it was often lent out for exhibitions and was damaged as a result. In 1937 it was relined by a private gallery in New York City and the drip was painted out. In 1944 it was relined and restored and in 1947 it was restored again, both times by a private New York dealer. The Brooklyn Museum performed two minor restorations in 1954 and 1957. Although it continued to travel frequently, The Swimming Hole received no comprehensive treatment until 1993.|$|E
5|$|Kutzer {{points out}} Timmy {{and his wife}} wear clothes, but the other {{squirrels}} and the bear do not. There is no apparent reason for this differentiation. She admits {{that this may be}} Potter's attempt to separate her anthropomorphized animals from her natural ones, but she believes the attempt fails on both narrative and artistic grounds. Logically, she argues, all the squirrels should wear (or not wear) clothes because they all live and behave in a natural manner: Timmy and Goody inhabit a nest in a tree (not a comfortable little house somewhere), and all the squirrels gather nuts for the coming winter. Except for Timmy having a wife, there is no clear distinction between natural and personified squirrel nature. In another stumbling block to logic, Timmy's red jacket appears then disappears then reappears in the illustrations with no basis either in the plot or Timmy's character, but apparently in Potter's personal need for a <b>splash</b> <b>of</b> colour here and there. In this case, Potter has allowed an external force to shape the tale rather than letting the tale find its own shape.|$|E
5|$|The mantle is a vestment or robe worn {{by members}} since the 15th century. Once made of wool, by the 16th century {{it was made}} of velvet. The mantle was {{originally}} purple, but varied during the 17th and 18th centuries between celestial blue, pale blue, royal blue, dark blue, violet, and ultramarine. Mantles are now dark blue and lined with white taffeta. The mantles of the Sovereign, the Prince of Wales, and Royal Knights and Ladies end in trains. The heraldic shield of St. George's Cross encircled by the Garter is sewn onto the left shoulder of the mantle, but the Sovereign's mantle instead has the star of the Order. Attached to the mantle over the right shoulder are a dark red velvet hood and surcoat, which have lost all function over time and appear to the modern observer simply as a <b>splash</b> <b>of</b> colour.|$|E

25|$|The {{spread of}} {{infection}} to pods above bare soil {{was shown to}} be greater relative to pods above litter. The {{reason for this is}} due to the <b>splash</b> <b>of</b> rain from bare soil spreads the inoculum to pods. However, litter under the tree prevented water droplets from splashing the soil particles as well as the inoculum beneath the litter to the above pods. Further, it was also reported that pods near the ground showed greater infections compared to higher pods due to greater soil was splashed and stick on the lower pods, therefore causes more infections.|$|E
25|$|Jeffreys {{was born}} into a middle-class family in Oxford, where he spent the first six years of his life until 1956, when the family moved to Luton, Bedfordshire. He {{attributes}} his curiosity and inventiveness to having been gained from his father, as well as his paternal grandfather, who held a number of patents. When he was eight, his father gave him a chemistry set, which he enhanced {{over the next few years}} with extra chemicals, even including a small bottle of sulfuric acid. He says he liked making small explosions, but an accidental <b>splash</b> <b>of</b> the sulfuric acid caused a burn, which left a permanent scar on his chin (now under his beard). His father also bought him a Victorian-era brass microscope, which he used to examine biological specimens. At about 12, he made a small dissecting kit (including a scalpel, crafted from a flattened pin) which he used to dissect a bumblebee, but he got into trouble with his parents when he progressed to dissecting a larger specimen. One Sunday morning he found a dead cat on the road while doing his paper round and took it home in his bag. He relates that he started to dissect it on the dining room table before Sunday lunch, causing a foul smell throughout the house after he ruptured its intestines.|$|E

500|$|Potter {{declared}} the tale her next favorite to The Tailor of Gloucester. The pictures {{are some of}} the most beautiful Potter ever created, especially the profusions of flowers in the doorways and garden plots. [...] The colors in the illustrations are not the muted browns and greens the reader expects in a Potter illustration, nor are they the contrasting colors such as the muted reds and blues Potter uses occasionally to give her illustrations a <b>splash</b> <b>of</b> color. Instead, the colors are bright oranges, violets, and yellows seldom seen in her other books. Even Ribby's lilac dress and Duchess's black mane illustrate Potter's concern for color in this book.|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of reviews {{for the first}} season were very positive, with critics noting the high production values, the well-realized world, compelling characters, and giving particular note {{to the strength of}} the child actors. Tim Goodman's review for The Hollywood Reporter stated, [...] "a few minutes into HBO's epic Game of Thrones series, it's clear that the hype was right and the wait was worth it". Mary McNamara from the Los Angeles Times called it [...] "...a great and thundering series of political and psychological intrigue bristling with vivid characters, cross-hatched with tantalizing plotlines and seasoned with a <b>splash</b> <b>of</b> fantasy". New York Posts Linda Stasi gave Thrones 3.5/4 stars stating, [...] "The art direction, acting and incredible sets are as breathtaking as the massive scope of the series". Many critics praised Peter Dinklage for his portrayal of Tyrion Lannister, with Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly stating, [...] "...if Dinklage doesn't get an Emmy for his clever, rude Tyrion Lannister, I'll be gobsmacked" [...] and Mary McNamara from the Los Angeles Times stating, [...] "If the man doesn't win an Emmy, heads should certainly roll".|$|E
500|$|Author Robert Rodriguez {{describes}} [...] "His Name Is Legs" [...] as a [...] "comedy number" [...] and [...] "a self-indulgent in-joke" [...] {{that appeared}} to show Harrison [...] "doubling down on efforts to alienate his audience", after the bad press he had received over the winter of 1974–75. On release, Dave Marsh of Rolling Stone said that the song [...] "might be Harrison's way of countering charges of humorlessness" [...] but that [...] "since neither Smith nor Harrison is very funny, it does more to confirm the charges." [...] In the NME, Neil Spencer referred {{to the image of}} Harrison with [...] "a chirpy smirk plastered across his dial" [...] as [...] "misleading", given the album's overall mood, and added: [...] "'His Names Is Legs (Ladies and Gentlemen)' is the odd track out because it's (ulp) not serious. It seems like an attempt to recapture some of the innocent light-heartedness of Beatle days." [...] Ray Coleman of Melody Maker predicted that Extra Texture would [...] "re-establish [...] as a powerful artist with an ear for unusual but attractive tunes allied to some quirky lyrics", and he described the closing song as an [...] "up-tempo <b>splash</b> <b>of</b> fun, and it jumps, too".|$|E

500|$|A {{reviewer}} from The Honolulu Advertiser {{called it}} [...] "A smart script," [...] with [...] "slick production values {{and maybe a}} <b>splash</b> <b>of</b> nostalgia got the remake of Hawaii Five-O placed on the CBS prime-time lineup this fall, {{but it will take}} more than beefcake and a remixed theme song to keep the show on the air." [...] The piece also pointed out that times have changed since the original series left the air, citing other shows that were set in Hawaii which have come and gone. It expressed a hope that the producers will succeed in bringing a new life to the title with this remake. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly graded the episode B+, calling it an [...] "unexpected pleasure," [...] and praised Caan for being [...] "terrific as the moody but excellent" [...] Danno. Tucker also believed that Kim and Park [...] "play off each other nicely." [...] Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times felt that the script was [...] "neatly balanced between action, clever banter and serious issues," [...] adding that it [...] "seems poised to hold its own in the modern age." [...] McNamara also liked O'Loughlin's performance, stating that his [...] "limpid-eye woodenness" [...] worked well for the role. Hanh Nguyen of Zap2it stated that it was [...] "damn entertaining" [...] and [...] "visually stimulating," [...] and enjoyed the chemistry between McGarrett and Danny.|$|E
500|$|A stained smiley {{face is a}} {{recurring}} image in the story, appearing in many forms. In The System of Comics, Thierry Groensteen described the symbol as {{a recurring}} motif that produces [...] "rhyme and remarkable configurations" [...] by appearing in key segments of Watchmen, notably {{the first and last}} pages of the series—spattered with blood on the first, and sauce from a hamburger on the last. Groensteen cites it as one form of the circle shape that appears throughout the story, as a [...] "recurrent geometric motif" [...] and due to its symbolic connotations. Gibbons created a smiley face badge as an element of The Comedian's costume in order to [...] "lighten" [...] the overall design, later adding a <b>splash</b> <b>of</b> blood to the badge to imply his murder. Gibbons said the creators came to regard the blood-stained smiley face as [...] "a symbol for the whole series", noting its resemblance to the Doomsday Clock ticking up to midnight. Moore drew inspiration from psychological tests of behaviorism, explaining that the tests had presented the face as [...] "a symbol of complete innocence". With the addition of a blood splash over the eye, the face's meaning was altered to become simultaneously radical and simple enough for the first issue's cover to avoid human detail. Although most evocations of the central image were created on purpose, others were coincidental. Moore mentioned in particular that [...] "the little plugs on the spark hydrants, if you turn them upside down, you discover a little smiley face".|$|E
500|$|The {{graphics}} of {{the game}} were positively received. Manny LaMancha of GamePro said that the visuals were brightly colored and smoothly animated and noted that the Xbox version's graphics were slightly cleaner than the PlayStation 2 version. Michael Lafferty of GameZone praised the environments as [...] "lush and richly textured" [...] and the cutscenes as [...] "very well done". Tony Guidi of TeamXbox commended the graphics as [...] "clean and crisp" [...] and added that the cutscenes were [...] "beautifully polished". Ryan Davis of GameSpot noted that [...] "Crash Nitro Kart maintains the brightly colored, cartoony look {{that has been the}} hallmark of past Crash Bandicoot games, though with slightly upgraded graphics. Ed Lewis of IGN said that the graphics for the single-player modes were [...] "bright and cheery and smooth", but decreased in quality in the multiplayer modes. Kristan Reed of Eurogamer concluded that [...] "CNK stays in exactly the cutesy ballpark you'd expect from the Day-Glo series, neither straying in any way from the generic cartoon worlds of old nor providing any graphical trickery that surprises hardened gamers looking for a <b>splash</b> <b>of</b> eye candy with their cartoon frippery." [...] Steven Rodriquez of Nintendo World Report noted that [...] "if you've played any of the other Crash Bandicoot games out there, then you {{have a pretty good idea}} what this one looks like." [...] Russ Fischer of GameSpy said that the game [...] "some nice graphics, which use a solid framerate and loads of color to capture the old Crash magic." ...|$|E
