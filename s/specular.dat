5|$|On July 8, 2009, Cassini's VIMS {{observed}} a <b>specular</b> reflection {{indicative of a}} smooth, mirror-like surface, off what today is called Jingpo Lacus, a lake in the north polar region shortly after the area emerged from 15 years of winter darkness.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Audouin Dollfus of the Observatoire de Paris {{reported}} anomalous {{features on}} the floor of Langrenus crater using a one-meter (3.2-foot) telescope. While observations on the night of December 29, 1992, were normal, unusually high albedo and polarization features were recorded the following night that did not change in appearance over the six minutes of data collection. Observations three days later showed a similar, but smaller, anomaly in the same vicinity. While the viewing conditions for this region were close to <b>specular,</b> it was argued that the amplitude of the observations were not consistent with a <b>specular</b> reflection of sunlight. The favored hypothesis was that this was the consequence of light scattering from clouds of airborne particles resulting from a release of gas. The fractured floor of this crater was cited as a possible source of the gas.|$|E
5|$|<b>Specular</b> {{reflections}} {{are indicative}} of a smooth, mirror-like surface, so the observation corroborated the inference {{of the presence of}} a large liquid body drawn from radar imaging. The observation was made soon after the north polar region emerged from 15 years of winter darkness.|$|E
5|$|Deathrow is {{a sports}} video game {{developed}} by Southend Interactive {{and published by}} Ubisoft Entertainment. It was released as an Xbox gaming system exclusive on 18 October 2002 in Europe and four days later in North America. Deathrow development began in May 1999 as an online PC (player computer) game. In early 2001, Southend transitioned to an Xbox console release, which let the team use pixel shaders, bump mapped textures, and <b>specular</b> lighting. Deathrow was built on an in-house 3D game engine and was Southend's first full release.|$|E
5|$|In June 2008, the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer on Cassini {{confirmed}} {{the presence of}} liquid ethane beyond doubt in Ontario Lacus. On December 21, 2008, Cassini passed directly over Ontario Lacus and observed <b>specular</b> reflection in radar. The strength of the reflection saturated the probe's receiver, indicating that the lake level did not vary by more than 3mm (implying either that surface winds were minimal, or the lake's hydrocarbon fluid is viscous).|$|E
5|$|Developers {{working on}} Oblivion focused on {{providing}} a tighter storyline, with fewer filler quests and more developed characters. The developers {{sought to make}} information in the game world more accessible to players, making the game easier {{to pick up and}} play. Oblivion features improved AI (courtesy of Bethesda's proprietary Radiant AI), improved physics (courtesy of the Havok physics engine), and impressive graphics, taking advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines like high dynamic range rendering (HDR) and <b>specular</b> mapping. Bethesda developed and implemented procedural content creation tools in the creation of Oblivions terrain, leading to landscapes that are more complex and realistic than those of past titles, with less of a drain on Bethesda's staff.|$|E
5|$|During Oblivions development, Bethesda {{concentrated}} on creating {{a system with}} a more realistic storyline, believable characters, and meaningful quests than had {{been done in the}} past. In comparison with previous titles in the series, the game features improved artificial intelligence thanks to the use of Bethesda proprietary Radiant A.I. software, and enhanced physics facilitated by the Havok physics engine. The graphics take advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines such as high dynamic range rendering (HDR) and <b>specular</b> mapping. Bethesda developed and implemented procedural content creation tools in the building of Oblivions terrain, leading to the expedited creation of landscapes that are more complex and realistic than in past titles.|$|E
5|$|During a flyby on 26 September 2012, Cassinis radar {{detected}} in Titan's northern polar region {{what is likely}} a river with a length of more than 400 kilometers. It has been compared with the much larger Nile river on Earth. This feature is connected to Ligeia Mare. Later, a paper ("Liquid-filled Canyons on Titan") published on Geophysical Research Letters on 9 August 2016 reported about the May 2013 Cassini RADAR altimeter observation of Vid Flumina channels, defined as a drainage network connected to Titan's second largest hydrocarbon sea, Ligeia Mare. Analysis of the received altimeter echoes showed that the channels are located in deep (up to ~570 m), steep-sided, canyons and have strong <b>specular</b> surface reflections that indicate they are currently liquid filled. Elevations of the liquid in these channels are {{at the same level}} as Ligeia Mare to within a vertical precision of about 0.7 m, consistent with the interpretation of drowned river valleys. <b>Specular</b> reflections are also observed in lower order tributaries elevated above the level of Ligeia Mare, consistent with drainage feeding into the main channel system. This is likely the first direct evidence of the presence of liquid channels on Titan and the first observation of hundred-meter deep canyons on Titan. Vid Flumina canyons are thus drowned by the sea {{but there are a few}} isolated observations to attest to the presence of surface liquids standing at higher elevations.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage for {{aircraft}} {{is complicated by}} the fact that the aircraft's background varies widely, depending on the location of the observer, the nature of the background and the aircraft's motion. For this reason, military aircraft were often painted to match the sky when viewed from below, and to either match the ground or break up the aircraft's outline when viewed from above. This is a form of countershading, likely to work best on aircraft such as heavy bombers that do not do fly inverted during combat. Because of the way light hits it, patterns of dark and light will often be present on an aircraft even if it is entirely one color, making it easier to see Reflections and <b>specular</b> highlights can be counteracted by painting an aircraft in neutral shades with a non-reflective, matte finish. There is a trade-off between the effectiveness of camouflage and the size of recognition markings: larger markings reduce the risk of friendly fire through misrecognition, but compromise camouflage.|$|E
5|$|To {{experience}} {{firsthand the}} processes mod-makers {{would have to}} go through with the new engine, Valve ported Half-Life (dubbed Half-Life: Source) and Counter-Strike to their new Source engine. Half-Life: Source is a straight port, lacking any new content or the Blue Shift High Definition pack. However, it does take advantage of vertex and pixel shaders for more realistic water effects, as well as Half-Life 2's realistic physics engine. They also added several other features from Half-Life 2, including improved dynamic lightmaps, vertex maps, ragdolls, and a shadowmap system with cleaner, higher resolution, <b>specular</b> texture and normal maps, as well as utilization of the render-to-texture soft shadows found in Half-Life 2s Source engine, along with 3D skybox replacements in place of the old 16-bit color prerendered bitmap skies. The Half-Life port possesses many of the Source engine's graphical strengths as well as control weaknesses that have been noted in the Source engine. Later updates added a field of view options, support for OS X and Linux, an optional high-definition texture pack, among other improvements. Half-Life: Source is available with special editions of Half-Life 2, or separately on Steam.|$|E
25|$|Surface {{roughness}} {{determines how}} much of the reflection is <b>specular</b> and how much diffuses, controlling how sharp or blurry the image will be. For perfectly <b>specular</b> reflection, the surface roughness must be kept smaller than the wavelength of the light. Microwaves, which sometimes have a wavelength greater than an inch (2.5 cm) can reflect specularly off a metal screen-door, while visible light, having wavelengths of only a few hundred nanometers (a few millionths of an inch), must meet a very smooth surface to produce <b>specular</b> reflection.|$|E
25|$|The {{visa policy}} Russia applies the {{principle}} of reciprocity, {{the principle of}} <b>specular.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Specular</b> {{holography}} uses a {{large number}} of curved mirrors embedded in a surface to produce three-dimensional imagery.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} optical mice detected {{movement on}} pre-printed mousepad surfaces, whereas the modern LED optical mouse works on most opaque diffuse surfaces; {{it is usually}} unable to detect movement on <b>specular</b> surfaces like polished stone. Laser diodes are also used for better resolution and precision, improving performance on opaque <b>specular</b> surfaces. Battery powered, wireless optical mice flash the LED intermittently to save power, and only glow steadily when movement is detected.|$|E
25|$|Reflections can {{be divided}} into two types: <b>specular</b> {{reflection}} and diffuse reflection. <b>Specular</b> reflection describes the gloss of surfaces such as mirrors, which reflect light in a simple, predictable way. This allows for production of reflected images that can be associated with an actual (real) or extrapolated (virtual) location in space. Diffuse reflection describes non-glossy materials, such as paper or rock. The reflections from these surfaces can only be described statistically, with the exact distribution of the reflected light depending on the microscopic structure of the material. Many diffuse reflectors are described or can be approximated by Lambert's cosine law, which describes surfaces that have equal luminance when viewed from any angle. Glossy surfaces can give both <b>specular</b> and diffuse reflection.|$|E
25|$|In {{situations}} where sunlight or other <b>specular</b> light is available, a white foam reflector {{is often used}} to accomplish the same effect as a PAR array.|$|E
25|$|X-ray mirrors produce <b>specular</b> {{reflection}} of X-rays. All known types work only at angles near grazing incidence, {{and only a}} small fraction of the rays are reflected. See also X-ray optics.|$|E
25|$|Materials update {{brought the}} {{capability}} of putting normal maps and <b>specular</b> maps on creations in Second Life, which can increase visual fidelity of objects by a substantial margin if utilized properly.|$|E
25|$|Watches {{and other}} jewelry that might enter the optical plane {{should not be}} allowed in the laboratory. All {{non-optical}} objects that are close to the optical plane should have a matte finish in order to prevent <b>specular</b> reflections.|$|E
25|$|Using visual photometry, Lambert {{presented}} {{the results of}} many experimental determinations of <b>specular</b> and diffuse reflectance, {{as well as the}} transmittance of panes of glass and lenses. Among the most ingenious experiments he conducted was that to determine the reflectance of the interior surface of a pane of glass.|$|E
25|$|Snell's law is {{generally}} true only for isotropic or <b>specular</b> media (such as glass). In anisotropic media such as some crystals, birefringence may split the refracted ray into two rays, the ordinary or o-ray which follows Snell's law, {{and the other}} extraordinary or e-ray {{which may not be}} co-planar with the incident ray.|$|E
25|$|Unpolarized light, after {{reflection}} at a <b>specular</b> (shiny) surface, generally obtains {{a degree}} of polarization. This phenomenon was observed in 1808 by the mathematician Étienne-Louis Malus after whom Malus's law is named. Polarizing sunglasses exploit this effect to reduce glare from reflections by horizontal surfaces, notably the road ahead viewed at a grazing angle.|$|E
25|$|The {{light that}} {{corresponds}} to direct transmission (or <b>specular</b> reflection {{in the case of}} a reflection grating) is called the zero order, and is denoted m = 0. The other maxima occur at angles which are represented by non-zero integers m. Note that m can be positive or negative, resulting in diffracted orders on both sides of the zero order beam.|$|E
25|$|The little {{other is}} the other who is not really other, but a {{reflection}} and projection of the Ego. Evans adds that for this reason the symbol a can represent both objet a and the ego in the Schema L. It is simultaneously the counterpart and the <b>specular</b> image. The little other is thus entirely inscribed in the Imaginary order.|$|E
25|$|At {{the scale}} of the {{wavelength}} of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally <b>specular</b> manner (not diffusely). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small angles of incident light, waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.|$|E
25|$|Hematite is colored {{black to}} steel or silver-gray, brown to reddish brown, or red. It is mined {{as the main}} ore of iron. Varieties include kidney ore, martite (pseudomorphs after magnetite), iron rose and specularite (<b>specular</b> {{hematite}}). While the forms of hematite vary, they all have a rust-red streak. Hematite is harder than pure iron, but much more brittle. Maghemite is a hematite- and magnetite-related oxide mineral.|$|E
25|$|A {{mirror is}} {{an object that}} {{reflects}} light {{in such a way}} that, for incident light in some range of wavelengths, the reflected light preserves many or most of the detailed physical characteristics of the original light, called <b>specular</b> reflection. This is different from other light-reflecting objects that do not preserve much of the original wave signal other than color and diffuse reflected light, such as flat-white paint.|$|E
25|$|Ellipsometry is a {{powerful}} technique for the measurement of the optical properties of a uniform surface. It involves measuring the polarization state of light following <b>specular</b> reflection from such a surface. This is typically done {{as a function of}} incidence angle or wavelength (or both). Since ellipsometry relies on reflection, it is not required for the sample to be transparent to light or for its back side to be accessible.|$|E
25|$|In <b>specular</b> reflection, the {{direction}} of the reflected ray is determined by the angle the incident ray makes with the surface normal, a line perpendicular to the surface {{at the point where the}} ray hits. The incident and reflected rays and the normal lie in a single plane, and the angle between the reflected ray and the surface normal is the same as that between the incident ray and the normal. This is known as the Law of Reflection.|$|E
25|$|Lasers in {{this class}} may cause damage if the beam enters the eye directly. This {{generally}} applies to lasers powered from 5–500mW. Lasers in this category can cause permanent eye damage with exposures of 1/100th of a second or more depending {{on the strength of}} the laser. A diffuse reflection is generally not hazardous but <b>specular</b> reflections can be just as dangerous as direct exposures. Protective eyewear is recommended when direct beam viewing of ClassIIIb lasers may occur. Lasers at the high power end of this class may also present a fire hazard and can lightly burn skin.|$|E
25|$|Albedo {{can affect}} the {{electrical}} energy output of solar photovoltaic devices. For example, {{the effects of a}} spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and crystalline silicon (c-Si)-based compared to traditional spectral-integrated albedo predictions. Research showed impacts of over 10%. More recently, the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the <b>specular</b> reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials (both human-made and natural) and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common photovoltaic system topologies: industrial (solar farms), commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched-roof applications.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the tin mines on Dartmoor are located in granite country rock {{and most of the}} lodes trend ENE–WSW and are of limited length, though there are exceptions. In the underground workings, the tin ore, cassiterite, was usually found in association with large amounts of tourmaline, and in central Dartmoor with much <b>specular</b> haematite. In {{the southern part of the}} moor, the cassiterite was usually found in relatively large grains, but the lodes were of very variable quality. These factors, combined with the fact that none of the underground workings was found to be profitable at depth, are typical of the deepest zone of tin mineralisation. The once very extensive alluvial deposits of tin ore, that were the first deposits to be mined, also point to the vast quantity of ore that once existed in lodes that have been eroded from above the granite since it was emplaced in the Carboniferous period.|$|E
25|$|Texture mapping {{has matured}} into a {{multistage}} process with many layers; generally, {{it is not}} uncommon to implement texture mapping, bump mapping or isosurfaces, normal mapping, lighting maps including <b>specular</b> highlights and reflection techniques, and shadow volumes into one rendering engine using shaders, which are maturing considerably. Shaders are now very nearly a necessity for advanced work in the field, providing considerable complexity in manipulating pixels, vertices, and textures on a per-element basis, and countless possible effects. Their shader languages HLSL and GLSL are active fields of research and development. Physically based rendering or PBR, which implements even more maps to simulate real optic light flow, is an active research area as well, along with advanced optics areas like subsurface scattering and photon mapping. Experiments into the processing power required to provide graphics in real time at ultra-high-resolution modes like Ultra HD are beginning, though beyond reach of all but the highest-end hardware.|$|E
25|$|Texture mapping is {{a method}} for adding detail, surface texture, or colour to a computer-generated graphic or 3D model. Its {{application}} to 3D graphics was pioneered by Dr Edwin Catmull in 1974. A texture map is applied (mapped) {{to the surface of}} a shape, or polygon. This process is akin to applying patterned paper to a plain white box. Multitexturing is the use of more than one texture at a time on a polygon. Procedural textures (created from adjusting parameters of an underlying algorithm that produces an output texture), and bitmap textures (created in an image editing application or imported from a digital camera) are, generally speaking, common methods of implementing texture definition on 3D models in computer graphics software, while intended placement of textures onto a model's surface often requires a technique known as UV mapping (arbitrary, manual layout of texture coordinates) for polygon surfaces, while non-uniform rational B-spline (NURB) surfaces have their own intrinsic parameterization used as texture coordinates. Texture mapping as a discipline also encompasses techniques for creating normal maps and bump maps that correspond to a texture to simulate height and <b>specular</b> maps to help simulate shine and light reflections, as well as environment mapping to simulate mirror-like reflectivity, also called gloss.|$|E
25|$|Especially {{due to the}} {{presence}} of the ground, there are some differences in propagation (and also in reflections responsible for TV ghosting) between horizontal and vertical polarizations. AM and FM broadcast radio usually use vertical polarization, while television uses horizontal polarization. At low frequencies especially, horizontal polarization is avoided. That is because the phase of a horizontally polarized wave is reversed upon reflection by the ground. A distant station in the horizontal direction will receive both the direct and reflected wave, which thus tend to cancel each other. This problem is avoided with vertical polarization. Polarization is also important in the transmission of radar pulses and reception of radar reflections by the same or a different antenna. For instance, back scattering of radar pulses by rain drops can be avoided by using circular polarization. Just as <b>specular</b> reflection of circularly polarized light reverses the handedness of the polarization, as discussed above, the same principle applies to scattering by objects much smaller than a wavelength such as rain drops. On the other hand, reflection of that wave by an irregular metal object (such as an airplane) will typically introduce a change in polarization and (partial) reception of the return wave by the same antenna.|$|E
500|$|Digital Domain {{chose not}} to use motion capture for Mya's {{movements}} as they believed it would constrain the character too much. Instead they used rotoscoping to place their digital character over the real model. The evening gown Motorola selected for Mya to debut in was described by Digital Domain as the most difficult item of clothing they could have chosen, due to its transparency and layering. To render 150 frames (equating to 5–6 seconds of actual footage) of Mya moving in the gown in low-resolution required approximately 6 hours of processing time; the final high-resolution shots took longer. Mya's rendering was so complex she crashed the computers at Digital Domain several times. Mya's creators said they had difficulty making Mya appear {{as if she were}} [...] "alive", and focused intensely on movements, <b>specular</b> highlights and eye blinks in order to [...] "bring her to life". [...] The <b>specular</b> highlights also had the intended effect of making Mya shine in an inhuman manner; when the light hit Mya at certain angles, a rainbow would appear. Mya's skin was described as [...] "part china doll, part disco ball." [...] Her distinct shine was based on that of a china plate that the commercial's director, Alex Proyas, had bought in Australia. In some shots of Mya, images were deliberately downgraded and had scan lines added to make the character appear more artificial.|$|E
