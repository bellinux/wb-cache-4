40|$|This paper {{presents}} a three-year (1985, 1986, and 1987) comparison of ozone profiles within the <b>southern</b> <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> for September and October, using {{data obtained by}} the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II.

The interannual variability of total ozone, temperature, and temperature area or vortex size were found to display a quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) signal similar to that established by Garcia and Solomon (1987) for Antarctica. Since the 1985 and 1987 years displayed the same QBO phase (westerly) and the 1987 depletion was greater than that of 1985, it is concluded that the long-term secular ozone trend continues to be downward...|$|E

It was found that, while the concentrations of long-lived trace gases remained relatively constant for fixed potential temperature and latitude, the ozone mixing ratio {{over the same period}} declined by more than 50 percent inside the polar vortex near 18 -km altitude. These data indicate a substantial photochemical sink of ozone.

The data set has dynamical fields that are very close to the reanalysis below 1 hPa and chemical tracers that are self-consistent with respect to the model winds and temperature. The chemical tracers are expected to be close to actual observations.

40|$|Recently, {{the results}} of an initial study of the {{southern}} polar region of Venus, using measurements from the VIRTIS instrument from the Venus Express Mission, revealed it to be in constant dynamic change, with the <b>southern</b> <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> displaced from the rotational geometry of the planet. Here, we place these results in the context of measurements taken over a two year period. We examine the dynamics of the southern polar region based on measurements of winds at the 45 and 65 km levels, detected from cloud motion monitoring by the VIRTIS instrument. The wind velocity components were determined by an automatic cloud-tracking technique based on evaluating the similarity between pairs of images of cloud structures at a specific atmospheric altitude, separated by a short time interval. The images were obtained at infrared wavelengths of 1. 74 and 2. 3 μm, for the night side, and 3. 9 and 5. 0 μm, for both the day and night sides. These wavelengths are sensitive to radiation originating from levels close to the base and {{to the top of the}} cloud deck, respectively. The technique assumes that the clouds are passive tracers of the atmospheric mass flow, and that the cloud structure does not change substantially between the two images. Our objectives have been 1) to provide horizontal maps of direct wind measurements at cloud tops and in the lower cloud level with a high spatial resolution; 2) to characterize the <b>southern</b> <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> as to its motion, rotation rate and dynamical stability; 3) to constrain the contribution of the circumpolar circulation to the angular momentum budget; and 4) to provide valuable information for Venus climate modelling, for the planning of future probe or balloon missions, and to examine the Venus polar vortex in the context of other planetary vortices. The circulation in the southern polar region is dominated by the zonal flow, which is much stronger than the meridional circulation. The latitudinal profiles show a relatively smooth variation and the vertical shear between the 45 -km and 65 -km levels is on the order of 5 – 10 ms− 1.

40|$|Using {{satellite}} observations, reanalysis data, {{and model}} simulations, this study investigates {{the effect of}} sea surface temperature (SST) on interannual variations of lower-stratospheric ozone at southern high latitudes in austral spring. It is found that the SST variations across the East Asian marginal seas (5 ° S– 35 ° N, 100 – 140 ° E) rather than the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean, where ENSO occurs, have the most significant correlation with the southern high-latitude lower-stratospheric ozone changes in austral spring. Further analysis reveals that planetary waves originating over the marginal seas in austral spring can propagate towards southern middle to high latitudes via teleconnection pathway. The anomalous propagation and dissipation of ultra-long Rossby waves in the stratosphere strengthen/cool (weaken/warm) the <b>southern</b> <b>polar</b> <b>vortex,</b> which produces more (less) active chlorine and enhances (suppresses) ozone depletion in the southern high-latitude stratosphere on one the hand and impedes (favors) the transport of ozone from the southern middle-latitude stratosphere to high latitudes on the other.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to discuss the altitude dependent interannual variability of ozone inside the <b>southern</b> <b>polar</b> stratospheric <b>vortex</b> during spring. Trend of ozone mixing ratio as well as possible correlation to global forcing processes, and transient perturbations by volcanic aerosols are obtained by using balloon-borne ozone sonde data obtained at three Antarctic stations located at about 70 °S between 30 °E and 08 °W. For the period 1966 to 1995 negative trend in ozone mixing ratio is statistically significant with 99 % confidence between the 330 K and 670 K isentropic level. For the period 1985 to 1995 significant negative trends are recognized in three altitude ranges during spring. The interannual variability of ozone in the middle polar stratosphere is strongly affected by the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). For the period from 1985 to 1988 the pattern of year to year changes might be explained by a synergetic effect of ENSO and Quasi Biennial Oscillation of winds in the tropical stratosphere. Inside the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> the impact of volcanic aerosols on vertical ozone distribution shows a similar altitude dependency as found for mid-latitudes but downward displaced by about 5 km in altitude.

40|$|The {{effect of}} spatial and {{temporal}} variations in the radiative damping rate on the response to an imposed forcing or diabatic heating is examined in a zonal-mean model of the middle atmosphere. Attention is restricted to the extratropics, where a linear approach is viable. It is found that regions with weak radiative damping rates are more sensitive in terms of temperature to the remote influence of the diabatic circulation. The delay in the response in such regions can mean that ‘downward’ control is not achieved on seasonal time-scales. A seasonal variation in the radiative damping rate modulates {{the evolution of the}} response and leaves a transient-like signature in the annual mean temperature field. Several idealized examples are considered, motivated by topical questions. It is found that wave drag outside the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> can significantly affect the temperatures in its interior, so that high-latitude, high-altitude gravity-wave drag is not the only mechanism for warming the <b>southern</b> hemisphere <b>polar</b> <b>vortex.</b> Diabatic mass transport through the 100 hPa surface is found to lag the seasonal evolution of the wave drag that drives the transport, and thus cannot be considered to be in the downward control regime.

40|$|We {{have run}} two twenty-year {{integrations}} {{of a global}} circulation model using 1978 - 1980 and 1998 - 2000 monthly mean ozone climatologies. The ozone climatology is used solely in the radiation scheme of the model. Several key differences between the model runs will be presented. The temperature and potential vorticity (PV) structure of the lower stratosphere, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere, is significantly changed using the 1998 - 2000 ozone climatology. In the Southern Hemisphere summer, the lapse rate and PV-defined polar tropopauses are both at altitudes {{on the order of}} several hundred meters greater than the 1978 - 1980 climatological run. The 380 K potential temperature surf= is likewise at a greater altitude. The mass of the extratropical lowermost stratosphere (between the tropopause and 380 K surface) remains unchanged. The altitude differences are not observed in the Northern Hemisphere. The different ozone fields do not produce a significant change in the annual extratropical stratosphere-troposphere exchange of mass although slight variations in the spatial distribution of the exchange exist.

40|$|Monthly zonal mean HOCl {{measurements}} by the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) {{are presented}} for the episode from June 2002 to March 2004. Highest molar mixing ratios are found at pressure levels between 6 and 2 hPa, whereby largest mixing ratios occasionally exceed 200 ppt. The mixing ratio maximum is generally at lower altitudes {{in the summer}} hemisphere than in the winter hemisphere except for chlorine activation conditions in polar vortices, where enhanced HOCl abundances are {{also found in the}} lower stratosphere. During nighttime the maximum is found at higher altitudes than during daytime. Particularly low values are found in subpolar regions in the winter hemisphere, coinciding with the mixing barrier formed by the polar vortex boundary. The Antarctic polar winter HOCl distribution in 2002, the year of the split of the <b>southern</b> <b>polar</b> <b>vortex,</b> resembles northern polar winters rather than other southern polar winters. Increased HOCl amounts in response to the so-called Halloween solar proton event in autumn 2003 affect the representativeness of data recorded during this particular episode.

40|$|Anomalies in the Antarctic {{total ozone}} and amplitudes of the quasi-stationary {{planetary}} {{waves in the}} lower stratosphere temperature during the winter and spring of 1988 and 2002 have been compared. Westward displacement of the quasi-stationary wave (QSW) extremes by 50 &deg;&ndash; 70 &deg; relative to the preceding years of the strong stratospheric polar vortex in 1987 and 2001, respectively, was observed. A dependence of the quasi-stationary wave ridge and trough positions {{on the strength of}} the westerly zonal wind in the lower stratosphere is shown. Comparison of the QSW amplitude in the lower stratosphere temperature in July and August shows that the amplitude distribution with latitude in August could be considered as a possible indication of the future anomalous warming in Antarctic spring. In August 2002, the QSW amplitude of 10 K at the edge region of the polar vortex (60 &deg; S&ndash; 65 &deg; S) preceded the major warming in September, whereas in August 1988, the highest 7 K amplitude at 55 &deg; S preceded the large warming in the next months.

40|$|Global {{gravity wave}} (GW) {{distributions}} are retrieved from infrared emission limb soundings {{taken by the}} CRISTA instrument in August 1997 and by the SABER instrument in August 2003. The investigated altitudes cover the whole middle atmosphere from the tropopause to the mesopause. The data agree semi-quantitatively in their salient features and only small deviations due to the different meteorological conditions {{in the two years}} are observed. Of particular interest is the decrease of GW activity {{at the top of the}} <b>southern</b> <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> and an accompanying shift of GW activity towards the subtropics in the mesosphere. We emulate this feature by two conceptionally different models, the Warner and McIntyre spectral parameterization scheme and the GROGRAT GW ray tracer. Both models indicate that saturation limits and GW breaking are the governing processes in creating this structure. Also, both models can well reproduce the global distributions except for two important points: (1) convectively generated GWs in the northern subtropics are largely underestimated; (2) northern hemisphere high latitude activity is grossly overestimated. These points indicate that GW distribution in general circulation models are not fully realistic. Refined measurements are required to constrain more realistic GW source distributions.

40|$|The {{impact of}} NO x and HO x {{production}} by {{three types of}} energetic particle precipitation (EPP), auroral zone medium and high energy electrons, solar proton events and galactic cosmic rays on the middle atmosphere is examined using a chemistry climate model. This process study uses ensemble simulations forced by transient EPP derived from observations with one-year repeating sea surface temperatures and fixed chemical boundary conditions for cases with and without solar cycle in irradiance. Our model results show a wintertime polar stratosphere ozone reduction of between 3 and 10 % in agreement with previous studies. EPP is found to modulate the radiative solar cycle effect in the middle atmosphere in a significant way, bringing temperature and ozone variations closer to observed patterns. The <b>Southern</b> Hemisphere <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> undergoes an intensification from solar minimum to solar maximum instead of a weakening. This changes the solar cycle variation of the Brewer-Dobson circulation, with a weakening during solar maxima compared to solar minima. In response, the tropical tropopause temperature manifests a statistically significant solar cycle variation resulting in about 4 % more water vapour transported into the lower tropical stratosphere during solar maxima compared to solar minima. This has implications for surface temperature variation due to the associated change in radiative forcing...|$|R
40|$|The winter-time stratospheric {{westerly}} winds {{circling the}} Antarctic continent, {{also known as}} the <b>Southern</b> Hemisphere <b>polar</b> <b>vortex,</b> create a barrier to mixing of air between middle and high latitudes. This dynamical isolation has important consequences for export of ozone-depleted air from the Antarctic stratosphere to lower latitudes. The prevailing view of this dynamical barrier has been an annulus compromising steep gradients of potential vorticity (PV) that create a single semi-permeable barrier to mixing. Analyses presented here show that this barrier often displays a bifurcated structure where a doubled-walled barrier exists. The bifurcated structure manifests as enhanced gradients of PV at two distinct latitudes – usually on the inside and outside flanks of the region of highest wind speed. Metrics that quantify the bifurcated nature of the vortex have been developed and their variation in space and time has been analysed. At most isentropic levels between 370  K and 850  K, bifurcation is strongest in winter and reduces dramatically during spring. From August onwards a distinct structure emerges, where elevated bifurcation remains between 475  K and 600  K, and a mostly single walled barrier occurs at other levels. While bifurcation at a given level evolves from month to month, and does not always persist through a season, inter-annual variations in the strength of bifurcation display coherence across multiple levels in any given month. Accounting for bifurcation allows the region of reduced mixing to be better characterized. These results suggest that improved understanding of cross-vortex mixing requires consideration of the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> not as a single mixing barrier, but as a barrier with internal structure that is likely to manifest as more complex gradients in trace gas concentrations across the vortex barrier region...|$|R

40|$|An {{observed}} {{trend in}} the Southern Hemisphere annular mode (SAM) during recent decades has involved an intensification of the polar vortex. The source of this trend {{is a matter of}} scientific debate with stratospheric ozone losses, greenhouse gas increases, and natural variability all being possible contenders. Because it is difficult to separate the contribution of various external forcings to the observed trend, a state-of-the-art global coupled model is utilized here. Ensembles of twentieth-century simulations forced with the observed time series of greenhouse gases, tropospheric and stratospheric ozone, sulfate aerosols, volcanic aerosols, solar variability, and various combinations of these are used to examine the annular mode trends in comparison to observations, in an attempt to isolate the response of the climate system to each individual forcing. It is found that ozone changes are the biggest contributor to the observed summertime intensification of the <b>southern</b> <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> {{in the second half of}} the twentieth century, with increases of greenhouse gases also being a necessary factor in the reproduction of the observed trends at the surface.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the axial component of the atmospheric angular momentum vector (AAM) is investigated for September 2002, using ECMWF analyses. The components of the conservation equation of AAM for southern polar cap volume are calculated {{in order to examine}} the importance of their contributions to the AAM tendency during the unexpected break-up of the <b>southern</b> <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> in the last week of September. The AAM tendency for the mean polar cap (90 ◦– 65 ◦ S) oscillates with a period of 5 d until the break-up of the polar vortex, after that it is negative for about 9 d. The polar friction torque induced by katabatic winds is weakly positive and nearly constant. For this mean polar cap, the mountain torque at the surface is mainly positive and larger than the friction torque. The strong changes of the mountain torque are caused by shifts of surface pressure patterns induced by a Rossby wave train touching the orography of Antarctica. The fluxes of AAM are northwards and reduce the AAM of the polar cap volume. The changes of AAM fluxes are mainly determined by the {{evolution of}} momentum fluxes due to transient Rossby waves in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. The vortex break-up is associated with a strong decrease of the amount of mountain torque and an increase in the convergence of relative AAM fluxes. 1...|$|E
40|$|During recent decades, the {{tropical}} Indo-Pacific Ocean {{has become increasingly}} warmer. Meanwhile, both {{the northern and southern}} hemispheric polar vortices (NPV and SPV) have exhibited a deepening trend in boreal winter. Although previous studies have revealed that {{the tropical}} Indian Ocean warming (IOW) favors an intensifying NPV and a weakening SPV, how the tropical Pacific Ocean warming (POW) influences the NPV and SPV remains unclear. In this study, a comparative analysis has been conducted through ensemble atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) experiments. The results show that, for the Northern Hemisphere, the two warmings exerted opposite impacts in boreal winter, in that the IOW intensified the NPV while the POW weakened the NPV. For the Southern Hemisphere, both the IOW and POW warmed the southern polar atmosphere and weakened the SPV. A diagnostic analysis based on the vorticity budget revealed that such an interhemispheric difference in influences from the IOW and POW in boreal winter was associated with different roles of transient eddy momentum flux convergence between the hemispheres. Furthermore, this difference may have been linked to different strengths of stationary wave activity between the hemispheres in boreal winter.

Analyses are made {{for the month of}} September 2002, when there was an unprecedented split in the <b>southern</b> hemisphere <b>polar</b> <b>vortex.</b> The analyses are validated against independent ozone observations from sondes, limb-occultation and total column ozone satellite instruments. Through most of the stratosphere, precision varies from 5 to 15 %, and biases are 15 % or less of the analysed field. Problems remain in the vortex and below the 60 hPa. level, especially at the tropopause where the analyses have too much ozone and poor agreement with independent data. Analysis problems are largely a result of the model rather than the data, giving confidence in the MIPAS ozone retrievals, though there may be a small high bias in MIPAS ozone in the lower stratosphere. Model issues include an excessive Brewer-Dobson circulation, which results both from known problems with the tracer transport scheme and from the data assimilation of dynamical variables. The extreme conditions of the vortex split reveal large differences between existing linear ozone photochemistry schemes. Despite these issues, the ozone analyses are able to successfully describe the ozone hole split and compare well to other studies of this event.

40|$|The {{work done}} on this grant {{primarily}} concerns {{the measurement of}} aerosol in the stratosphere from NASA ER- 2 aircraft in studies of stratospheric ozone depletion in {{the northern and southern}} hemispheres. The ER- 2 Condensation Nucleus Counter (CNC) measures the number concentration of particles in the diameter range of approximately 0. 01 to 1 micron. The Passive Cavity Aerosol Spectrometer measures size distributions in the 0. 17 to 3 micron diameter range. This instrument was upgraded during this grant period to a Focused Cavity Aerosol Spectrometer (FCAS). This upgrade permitted the instrument to measure particles as small as 0. 05 micron in diameter. The inlet for the PCAS and FCAS was modified and characterized under this grant so that the modifications to the aerosol due to anisokinetic sampling and heating upon sampling and in transport to the measurement location were accounted for in the data analysis. These measurements permitted observations of particle production in the <b>southern</b> hemisphere winter <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> and observation of the impact of denitrification on the number concentration of the aerosol in the denitrified air. In the northern <b>polar</b> <b>vortex,</b> the measurements provided a characterization of the sulfate aerosol. Following the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, the measurements permitted an accurate characterization of the sulfate aerosol enhancements resulting from the eruption. This led to studies of the impact of heterogeneous chemistry on the partitioning of the partitioning of the reactive nitrogen species and the partitioning of the chlorine reservoir...|$|R
40|$|The {{climate and}} natural {{variability}} of the large-scale stratospheric circulation simulated by a newly developed general circulation model are evaluated against available global observations. The simulation {{consisted of a}} 30 -year annual cycle integration performed with a comprehensive model of the troposphere and stratosphere. The observations consisted of a 15 -year dataset from global operational analyses of the troposphere and stratosphere. The model evaluation concentrates on the simulation {{of the evolution of}} the extratropical stratospheric circulation in both hemispheres. The December–February climatology of the observed zonal mean winter circulation is found to be reasonably well captured by the model, although in the Northern Hemisphere upper stratosphere the simulated westerly winds are systematically stronger and a cold bias is apparent in the polar stratosphere. This Northern Hemisphere stratospheric cold bias virtually disappears during spring (March–May), consistent with a realistic simulation of the spring weakening of the mean westerly winds in the model. A considerable amount of monthly interannual variability is also found in the simulation in the Northern Hemisphere in late winter and early spring. The simulated interannual variability is predominantly caused by polar warmings of the stratosphere, in agreement with observations. The breakdown of the Northern Hemisphere stratospheric <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> appears therefore to occur in a realistic way in the model. However, in early winter the model severely underestimates the interannual variability, especially in the upper troposphere. The Southern Hemisphere winter (June–August) zonal mean temperature is systematically colder in the model, and the simulated winds are somewhat too strong in the upper stratosphere. Contrary to the results for the Northern Hemisphere spring, this model cold bias worsens during the Southern Hemisphere spring (September–November). Significant discrepancies between the model results and the observations are therefore found during the breakdown of the <b>Southern</b> Hemisphere <b>polar</b> <b>vortex.</b> For instance, the simulated Southern Hemisphere stratosphere westerly jet continuously decreases in intensity more or less in situ from June to November, while the observed stratospheric jet moves downward and poleward...|$|R
40|$|Non-scanning UV-(A&B) spectroradiometers of our {{own design}} have been {{deployed}} for long-term measurements at NDSC sites in both polar regions. Since 1997 spectral resolved UV-spectra are continuously recorded at Neumayer Station (Antarctica, 70. 65 °S, 8. 25 °W) and at Ny-Aalesund (Spitsbergen, 78. 9 °N, 11. 9 °E). Concerning some parameters which are important for UV radiative transfer the conditions differ significantly at these two stations. Due to {{the differences in the}} stability of the northern and <b>southern</b> <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> ozone depletion in spring is found only in some years at Spitsbergen whereas the Antarctic ozone hole can be observed every year over Antarctica. Our UV measurements are evaluated by taking into account total ozone data from ozone sondes and TOMS (Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer) satellite data. To suppress the dominating influence of cloud variations on the UV radiative transfer, the ratio of the irradiation at two wavelengths (300 nm/ 320 nm), the so-called ozone index, is being used. By making use of the daily available TOMS data the expected anticorrelation of the ozone index and the total ozone could be verified. For the observation period the comparison of changes in the ozone index and total ozone for different years leads to a quantitative relation between the two measurands, the radiation amplification factor of total ozone. Apart from the different variability in total ozone, there is a distinctive seasonal variation in ground albedo and cloud cover at Spitsbergen, which is not found at Neumayer Station. These parameters are determinative for UV fluxes at the ground. A comparison of the datasets from the two sites will be presented...|$|E
40|$|Gravity waves play {{a crucial}} role in the {{dynamics}} of the middle atmosphere through the vertical transport of tropospheric energy and momentum. Despite the importance of gravity wave effects, nearly all general circulation models significantly underestimate gravity wave drag around the southern wintertime polar vortex, leading to large discrepancies from observed behaviour and a strong impediment to model progress. Here we use GPS radio occultation data from the COSMIC satellite constellation to investigate key properties of gravity waves in and around the <b>southern</b> <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> and over the gravity wave hot spot of the southern Andes/Drake Passage/Antarctic Peninsula. We also develop spectral analysis tools in order to further the capabilities of our data for this purpose. By analysing vertical profiles of atmospheric temperature from COSMIC, we find evidence of the meridional propagation of waves into the polar vortex from sources far to the north. We develop a new wavelet-based analysis technique for the quantitative identification of gravity waves in COSMIC profiles, and use it to investigate gravity wave intermittency over the hot spot region and around the edge of the polar vortex. We then estimate gravity wave momentum flux over the hot spot from closely-spaced pairs of COSMIC profiles. Finally, we develop a new two-dimensional spectral analysis method for the measurement of gravity wave amplitudes, horizontal wavelengths and directions of propagation from AIRS measurements, based upon the two-dimensional Stockwell transform. We show that, by using an alternative elliptical spectral window, we can dramatically improve the measurement of wave amplitude. We apply our two-dimensional Stockwell transform to AIRS measurements over the known gravity wave hot spots of South Georgia and the Antarctic Peninsula, measuring gravity properties and momentum fluxes with improved confidence, accuracy and rigour over current methods...|$|E
40|$|Mars’ winter {{atmosphere}} is characterised by a polar vortex of low temperatures around the winter pole, circumscribed {{by a strong}} westerly jet. These vortices {{have a significant effect}} on the atmospheric circulation and on dust and volatile transport: modelling work has shown that increasing model dust opacity has a large effect on the northern vortex, but little effect on the southern vortex [1]. Meanwhile, new MCS retrievals with updated, 2 D geometry [2] have revealed a sharp exclusion of dust aerosol from the <b>southern</b> <b>polar</b> <b>vortex,</b> despite the presence of transported water ice; the northern polar vortex displays less dust exclusion and a greater water ice abundance [3]. This exclusion remains to be explained, as does a more general characterisation of how dust drives and is driven by Mars’ polar atmosphere. This study uses data assimilation to integrate MCS temperature and dust profiles into a Mars Global Circulation Model. While MCS dust profiles have been assimilated before and yielded improved fit to retrievals [4, 5], this represents the first attempt to assimilate dust profiles for this purpose specifically using new and improved MCS 2 D retrievals. By combining our best model and our most comprehensive observations, dust profile assimilation offers a uniquely powerful way to examine polar dust processes. Dust transport quantities and patterns are presented for the martian polar regions at various times of year, and compared to free-run models and retrievals. [1] Guzewich, S. D., Toigo, A.

40|$|As {{the most}} {{prominent}} feature of the <b>polar</b> stratosphere, <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> results in widespread changes in the climate system, especially in the ozone variation. In this study, the linkage between <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> and ozone depletion in Antarctic stratosphere during the period 1979 – 2016 is investigated; we calculated the averaged total column ozone within the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> based on the vortex edge (− 28. 8 [*]PVU PV contour) instead of the geographical region defined by latitude and longitude. Results from the spatial patterns of ozone and <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> suggest that the morphological changes of <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> can impact the {{horizontal distribution of ozone}} and the ozone within the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> experiences a severe depletion in spring. The negative relationship between ozone and <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> in terms of vortex area, strength, and breakup time is significant with the correlation coefficients of − 0. 57, − 0. 68, and − 0. 76, respectively. The breakup time of <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> {{plays an important role in}} the relation between <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> and ozone depletion with the highest-value correlation coefficient among three <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> parameters. Furthermore, the possible mechanism for this relationship is also discussed in this article...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the intercomparison of O 3, HNO 3, ClO, N 2 O and CO profiles {{measured by the}} two spaceborne microwave instruments MLS (Microwave Limb Sounder) and SMR (Submillimetre Radiometer) on board the Aura and Odin satellites, respectively. We compared version 1. 5 level 2 data from MLS with level 2 data produced by the French data processor version 222 and 225 and by the Swedish data processor version 2. 0 for several days in September 2004 and in March 2005. For the five gases studied, an overall good agreement is found between both instruments. Most of the observed discrepancies between SMR and MLS are consistent with results from other intercomparison studies involving MLS or SMR. O 3 profiles retrieved from the SMR 501. 8 GHz band are noisier than MLS profiles but mean biases between both instruments do not exceed 10 %. SMR HNO 3 profiles are biased low relative to MLS's by 30 % above the profile peak. In the lower stratosphere, MLS ClO profiles are biased low by up to 0. 3 ppbv relative to coincident SMR profiles, except in the <b>Southern</b> Hemisphere <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> {{in the presence of}} chlorine activation. N 2 O profiles from both instruments are in very good agreement with mean biases not exceeding 15 %. Finally, the intercomparison between SMR and MLS CO profiles has shown a good agreement from the middle stratosphere to the middle mesosphere in spite of strong oscillations in the MLS profiles. In the upper mesosphere, MLS CO concentrations are biased high relative to SMR while negative values in the MLS retrievals are responsible for a negative bias in the tropics around 30 hPa...|$|R
