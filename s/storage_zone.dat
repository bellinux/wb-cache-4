In this study we present a method to measure the fraction of the transient storage that is metabolically active (MATS) in two consecutive reaches with contrasting hydrological and biological characteristics. We used combined additions of resazurin (Raz) and Cl in a reach scoured to bedrock and in a reach containing a deep alluvial deposit. The MATS zones measured 0. 002 m² in the bedrock reach (37 % of transient storage) and 0. 291 m² in the alluvial reach (100 % of transient storage). The effective rate coefficient of Raz transformation in the MATS of the bedrock reach was approximately 16 times that of the alluvial reach. However, when we take into account the contribution of the MATS zone to overall metabolic activity, Raz transformation in the MATS zone was 2. 2 times slower in the bedrock reach than in the alluvial reach. The difference was similar to the difference in ecosystem respiration, which was 1. 8 times lower in the bedrock reach than in the alluvial reach, suggesting that the MATS zones were important contributors to ecosystem respiration.

The energy balance equations for each zone have been used to develop the expression of temperature distribution in the solar pond. Then this equation has been used to develop the equation for efficiency of the solar pond. The analysis is based on the boundary conditions at the interface between the zones and the matching conditions. In this method, heat is extracted from the <b>storage</b> <b>zone</b> of the solar pond. A theoretical analysis is conducted to obtain expression for the variation of temperature with depth of solar pond. The dependence of the energy efficiency of the solar pond on the thickness of <b>storage</b> <b>zone,</b> temperature of delivered heat, variation combinations of the pond and <b>storage</b> <b>zone</b> heat extraction only explored. The theoretical analysis suggests that heat extraction from the <b>storage</b> <b>zone</b> has the potential to increase the overall efficiency of a solar pond delivering heat at a relatively high temperature by up to 50 %, compared with the conventional solar pond method of heat extraction solely from the <b>storage</b> <b>zone.</b> The potential gain in efficiency using <b>storage</b> <b>zone</b> heat extraction is attributed to the <b>storage</b> <b>zone</b> that can be achieved with this method.

The high costs of desalinated potablewater and the depletion of fresh groundwater resources necessitate increased use of TSE as {{an important component of}} water resource management throughout the Middle East. TSE can replace potable-quality water in irrigation, with the latter becoming too valuable a resource to use for irrigation purposes. In urban regions of theMiddle East and North Africa, excess TSE is often available because of seasonal variations in demand and supply or that the development of reuse infrastructure has not kept pace with population growth, concomitant water use and TSE generation. Aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) technology provides an opportunity to store large volumes of TSE for later beneficial use. Natural attenuation processes that occur during underground storage in an ASR system can also act {{to improve the quality of}} stored water and thus provide an opportunity to 'polish' already high-quality TSE.

The field monitoring included sampling of tracer in the surface water {{as well as in the}} streambed sediments. A simultaneous injection of tritium and chromium facilitated an independent evaluation of the hydraulic transport into and out of the sub-surface <b>storage</b> <b>zones.</b> The difference in transport behaviour between the two tracers, were attributed to chemical reactivity. In terms of idealised transport models we found that the reactivity of chromium could be characterised by simple chemical concepts.

An independent evaluation of the streambed transport revealed that the impact of reaction kinetics was substantial.

A Mogi-type point pressure source or finite sphere with a radius of 1 km provides an adequate fit to the deformation field portrayed in time-sequential interferometric synthetic aperture radar images. From the end of the 1997 eruption through summer 2004, magma storage increased by 3. 2 – 4. 5 × 107 m 3, which corresponds to 75 – 85 % of the magma volume erupted in 1997.

The eruptive history of many subduction zone volcanoes includes the extrusion of blocky, silicic lava that forms domes or flows, {{but we do not}} yet understand what determines the duration of dome-forming behaviour, what path magma may take to the surface, or how these systems may change over time. This thesis presents an investigation of the Santiaguito complex of lava domes and flows in Guatemala, which has been erupting continuously since its inception in 1922. The Santiaguito lavas are predominantly dacitic to andesitic, with a gradual reduction in SiO 2 content from ~ 66 wt% in the 1920 s, to ~ 62 wt% in 2002. This is consistent with a ~ 15 % decrease in the extent of fractional crystallization over that time. The compositions of plagioclase phenocryst cores indicate a diminished role for magma mixing after the 1940 s. I model the Santiaguito system as progressively extracting magma from an extensive, chemically-stratified <b>storage</b> <b>zone.</b> Petrological data are consistent with a <b>storage</b> <b>zone</b> extending from ~ 25 to ~ 12 km depth, and magma storage temperatures of ~ 940 to ~ 980 °C.

The results of investigation show that the temperature of <b>storage</b> <b>zone</b> will increase by decreasing the depth of both UCZ and LCZ and increasing the depth of NCZ...|$|E
40|$|An exact, geometry-based {{analytical}} model is presented {{that can be}} used to compute the expected cycle time for a storage/retrieval (S/R) machine, executing single-commands, dual-commands, or both, in a rack structure that has been laid out in pre-specified <b>storage</b> <b>zones</b> for classes of goods. The rack may be either square-in-time or non-square-in-time. The approach is intuitively appealing, and it does not assume any certain layout shape, such as traditional "L-shaped" class layouts. The model has been coded in Turbo Pascal, and can be used by designers as a tool for quickly evaluating alternative layout configurations with respect to expected S/R cycle time in an AS/RS, and thereby the throughput of an automated warehouse over time. This model has been successfully applied in a major manufacturing plant in Europe to evaluate reconfigurations of their rack storage layouts over the past five years. ...|$|R

40|$|Recent work in {{the water}} supply {{catchments}} of Sydney, Australia, has explored the potential for using a range of sediment tracing approaches in post-fire landscapes. Sediment tracing techniques offer the potential to elucidate sources and pathways of sediment which can assist with mitigation and remediation of post-fire erosion events. Furthermore, their preservation in downstream sedimentary sequences can provide important information on recent fire frequency and erosional response. Whilst the theory behind tracing approaches is relatively straightforward, complications can arise in their application, especially in post-fire landscapes where impacts tend to be heterogeneous. In this contribution we appraise mineral magnetic and geochemical techniques for discriminating sediment sources and delivery dynamics, identify strengths and limitations of each approach and problems encountered in their application. In level terrain, clear responses were seen in measured tracing parameters with respect to fire severity. For example, low-frequency magnetic susceptibility values (Xlf) of sediment sourced from burnt areas (c. 8. 0 10 ⁻⁶ m³ kg⁻¹) were {{an order of magnitude}} greater than those of sediment derived from long-unburnt areas (c. 0. 8 10 ⁻⁶ m³ kg⁻¹) in response to transformation of amorphous Fe-minerals at high temperature. Similarly, severely burnt soil showed enrichment in nutrient and trace element properties relative to moderate and unburnt soil, most likely in association with mineralization of organic matter. For example, PbO concentrations increase from c. 30 mg kg⁻¹ in unburnt soil to c. 80 mg kg⁻¹ in severely burnt soil. However, signatures are less clearly defined in slope-derived soil samples, specifically footslope areas where material burnt and mobilised in previous wildfire events has accumulated. Ambiguous signatures from these zones will increase uncertainty in the output of sediment unmixing models. The role of footslope <b>storage</b> <b>zones</b> can be quantified through construction of fallout radioisotope-based sediment budgets which permit exclusion of ambiguous <b>storage</b> <b>zones</b> from unmixing models. We conclude that fire-related sediment source data must be interpreted in the context of slope or catchment scale sediment budgets. 2 page(s...|$|R
