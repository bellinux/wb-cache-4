[...] It interchanges with MD 648 (Baltimore Annapolis Boulevard), where 132,330 vehicles travel I-695 every day, before turning northwest and intersecting MD 170 (Camp Meade Road). The route encounters the Baltimore–Washington Parkway (MD 295) at a cloverleaf interchange where the route’s signage changes from eastwest to northsouth at this interchange. It turns {{more to the}} north from here and heads into commercial areas, interchanging with MD 168 (Nursery Road) and Hammonds Ferry Road. [...] Past this interchange, the route crosses the Patapsco River into Baltimore County and soon encounters a partial interchange with I-895 (Harbor Tunnel Thruway) with access only from the southbound direction of I-695 to I-895 northbound and from I-895 southbound to the northbound direction of I-695. Past this interchange, I-695 heads north, interchanging with Hollins Ferry Road in Lansdowne before passing under CSX’s Baltimore Terminal Subdivision and coming to an interchange with US 1 Alt. (Washington Boulevard) in Arbutus. A short distance later, I-695 comes to a <b>semidirectional</b> interchange with [...] I-95.|$|E
50|$|The {{interchange}} is {{a hybrid}} of the <b>semidirectional</b> T interchange configuration, with added complexity through the retention and modification of the Camden Valley Way partial diamond interchange over the South Western Motorway. Slip roads allow access to both the M5 eastbound and M7 northbound, as well as exit from the Hume Motorway onto Camden Valley Way. Access is also provided to the suburban street network at Beech Road from the westbound lanes of the M5, necessitating three levels of ramps. A shared pedestrian/cycle path was also constructed with the interchange, extending parallel to the M7.|$|E
5000|$|Venera 1 was a 643.5 kg probe {{consisting}} of a cylindrical body 1.05 m in diameter topped by a dome, totalling 2.035 m in height. This was pressurized to [...] with dry nitrogen, with internal fans to maintain even distribution of heat. Two solar panels extended from the cylinder, charging a bank of silver-zinc batteries. A 2-metre parabolic wire-mesh antenna was designed to send data from Venus to Earth on a frequency of 922.8 MHz. A 2.4-metre antenna boom was used to transmit short-wave signals during the near-Earth phase of the mission. <b>Semidirectional</b> quadrupole antennas mounted on the solar panels provided routine telemetry and telecommand contact with Earth during the mission, on a circularly-polarized decimetre radio band.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} further explore the {{coordination}} {{gain from the}} cloud cellular network, the Coordinated <b>Semidirectional</b> Distributed Antenna System (CS-DAS) is proposed with deploying 180 -degree sector antennas. Based on the CS-DAS, the coordinated cellular deployment structure is established with corresponding communication procedure designs. The handover process for CS-DAS is designed with less handover rate and signaling overheads. The system performances of ergodic capacity and Energy Efficiency are derived, with a strong focus on the downlink performances, and analyzed with comparisons of current cellular structure. The numerical expressions of ergodic capacity are obtained with improvements of coordinated gain. The Energy Efficiency with different transmission modes is also investigated. The simulation results verify the performance improvements...|$|E
30|$|Our work {{is based}} on the idea that {{entities}} that have the same orientation form a single unit. This is inspired by gestaltism or Gestalt psychology [2], a theory of mind and brain positing which states in the law of common fate that elements with the same moving direction are perceived as a collective or unit. In this work, we rely mostly on motion orientation as opposed to a <b>semidirectional</b> model [3] because gestaltism does not consider motion speed. In fact, we can see in real life that moving objects that follow the same patterns do not necessarily move at the same speed. For example, in a one-way road, cars move at different speeds while sharing the same motion pattern. In addition, augmenting the direction model with the motion speed information will increase the computation burden which is not desired in real-time systems.|$|E
