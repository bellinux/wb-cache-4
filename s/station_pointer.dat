50|$|Murdoch Mackenzie, FRS (1712-1797) was a Scottish {{hydrographer}} and cartographer. He {{is known}} for his survey of the Orkney Islands: the subsequent maps, known as the Mackenzie Charts are still in use. He is also credited with the invention of the <b>station</b> <b>pointer,</b> a navigational tool that preceded the marine sextant and chronometer.|$|E
5000|$|Born in Orkney and {{employed}} by the Royal Navy, {{he became the first}} person to accurately chart the coastline around North Ronaldsay where many vessels had come to grief. He created a measured baseline and established station points along the shore to perform the triangulation equations for the survey. His calculations of latitude were very accurate despite the use of primitive methods compared to today. [...] His work led to the construction of a lighthouse at Dennis Head on North Ronaldsay and his charts are still in use by shipping today. Mackenzie's survey of Orkney was featured in a 2005 episode of Map Man, presented by Nicholas Crane.He invented the <b>station</b> <b>pointer,</b> a tool used for surveying landscapes and making maps after his retirement, and once his nephew took over the coastal surveys. The instrument calculated the position of ships in respect to three stationary points on shore. Two crewmembers on the ship used Hadley's quadrant to determine their location in accordance with the charts. This method was used to navigate shore lines until the 20th century, but remain as a safety precaution in big maritime vessels.|$|E

50|$|Volkswagen Parati is {{a station}} wagon built on both generations since May 1982. The Parati I was a three-door sold in North America as the Fox Wagon. The second-generation Parati is sold in Argentina as the Gol Country. A five-door version was added in 1997 and the three-door version was dropped after the first {{facelift}} (G3). It is named after Paraty, a city on the southern coast of Rio de Janeiro state. It was formerly called <b>Pointer</b> <b>Station</b> Wagon in Mexico and it was sold there between 1999 and 2005.|$|R
5000|$|The Gol G2 was {{introduced}} in Mexico in spring 1998 as the Volkswagen Pointer (a name previously used in Latin America for a rebadged model based on the Ford Escort Mk V, the Pointer/Logus). The only version for this year was a three-door hatchback with a 1.8 litre 98 hp engine and a five-speed manual gearbox. The only extra cost option available was a package compounding air conditioning and power steering. For 1999 a five-door estate version, the Brazilian Parati (called the <b>Pointer</b> <b>Station</b> Wagon in Mexico) and the Saveiro (called the Pointer Pick Up) are added. They were marketed in three trim levels: Base, Comfort (A/C and power steering) and Luxe (14" [...] alloy wheels, power windows and remote control centralized door locks, A/C and power steering). For 2000 the Pointer received the same facelift as in Brazil and a sporty Pointer GTI based on the Brazilian Gol GTI is introduced. It was a three-door hatchback with a 2.0 litre 122 hp engine. It had AM/FM/Cassette radio, alloy wheels, all around disc brakes, and sporty black seats as standard equipment. In 2002 a basic Pointer City version is introduced, the former Comfort version is renamed the Trendline, and the Luxe variant as the Comfortline. In 2005 the <b>Pointer</b> <b>Station</b> Wagon and the Pointer GTI are discontinued and the former Pointer trims (but the City) are replaced by a new Pointer Mi version.|$|R
40|$|Background Forest area, stand {{quality and}} growth of Siberian larch in Mongolia have {{decreased}} significantly over recent decades. This forest decline is frequently attributed to factors such as unregulated logging, increased ecological disturbances (primarily fire) and climate change. In this study, we analyzed climate-growth response and pointer years for Siberian larch observed in the Altansumber forest research area in the Mongolian mountain forest steppe zone. We compare our results with previously published results of white birch from the same area. Methods We built a reference chronology from wood core samples taken from 30 trees in three neighboring larch stands. Climate-growth relationships were analyzed monthly and seasonally over the period 1962 – 2009 using climate data from the Eroo weather <b>station.</b> <b>Pointer</b> year analysis covered the same time frame. Results Our analysis of the larch chronology showed that precipitation during autumn {{of the previous year}} and directly before the growing season of the current year was the most decisive factor determining tree-ring growth. Regional pointer year analysis further indicated that a humid summer and autumn followed by a warm spring support current-year tree-ring growth in these larch stands. Our findings were comparable to a white birch study in the same area. The larch trees, however, showed stronger growth performance and were more tolerant of higher temperatures, notably in spring during peak fire season. Conclusions Water availability is the decisive factor for larch growth in the mountain forest steppe zone. The chronologies showed no climatic indication of insect infestations. Differences in climate-growth relationships of birch and larch trees during peak fire season may to some degree be explained by their respective means of protecting themselves against low-intensity surface fires (e. g. thick bark of larch). These fire events occur regularly in the region and are influenced by climatic factors. Our analysis and comparison of climate tree-growth relationships may be valuable for developing climate- and disturbance-resilient forestry practices in Mongolian mountain forest ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|In {{the subject}} of {{identifying}} sediment sources and erosion processes at catchment level researchers have proposed various methods. Most of the techniques have been applied in isolation. A few workers have combined some methods but still they could not ascertain their findings. As a result they recommended more sophisticated methods in order to compare the results. Little however {{has been done to}} correlate suspended sediment concentrations using spatial and temporal hydrological variables like rainfall and surface runoff at reasonable time step such as daily time series. In this study selected methods by previous workers are used and compared. The hydrological variables mapping technique has complemented the results of various renowned sediment sources identification techniques. The introduced method gives not only probable sources and processes but also it additionally identifies location based sediment sources using rainfall <b>stations</b> as <b>pointers.</b> The combined results from both methods indicate that either clay soil land plots or agricultural areas are potential sediment source areas. The result is comparable to previous researchers¿ findings in the Pangani River basin that mapped the erosion zones using simple empirical and complex physics-based mathematical models. Although, the methods adopted in this study lacked high-resolution data, the authors believe that the methods and modifications applied give a quick, reliable and more insight to future sediment yield modelling efforts at a catchment level. For instance, a distributed watershed sediment yield model would be appropriate based on high spatial and temporal variation of the hydrological variables as reported in this study. Also, the results suggest that Sediment yield model that simulates sheet erosion might be an ideal tool since the major source areas of the transported sediment are topsoils or sheet erosion...|$|R
