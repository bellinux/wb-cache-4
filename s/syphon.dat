5|$|Following {{the course}} of the {{enlarged}} South Drain, a lock raised the level of the canal at Shapwick, while the Drain turned off to run parallel to the canal but to its north. The railway ran between the two waterways, crossing to {{the south side of the}} canal immediately after the single arched aqueduct and <b>syphon</b> over the South Drain. The remains of the three-arched aqueduct and <b>syphon</b> over the River Brue are still visible, near the old railway bridge, and from there the canal headed towards Glastonbury, passing the Ham Wall and Street Heath nature reserves and making a sharp right-hand turn just before its terminal basin, which was located near the old Glastonbury and Street railway station.|$|E

25|$|The three {{parallel}} channels, {{with the}} A18 {{running to the}} south of the Hatfield Waste Drain, arrive at Pilfrey Bridge, where they are joined by the South Engine Drain and the Folly Drain. The River Torne used to continue eastwards to a sluice at Althorpe, but the sluice is no more and the channel drains in the reverse direction. The South Engine Drain, which was built as part of improvements made in 1795, used to pass under the Torne and the road through another grade II listed <b>syphon,</b> which dates from 1813. The <b>syphon</b> is now redundant, since the channels have been connected together. Three parallel channels, known as the Three Rivers, flow to the north east, passing under the Doncaster to Scunthorpe railway, to arrive at Keadby pumping station.|$|E

25|$|The B class {{locomotives}} featured {{an unusual}} design of firebox with two separate chambers, {{each with its}} own firedoor, divided by a water space that effectively acted as a thermic <b>syphon,</b> and joined at the tubeplate. The two fireboxes were designed to be worked separately, with one fire being built while the other was burning, and was designed to extract the maximum heat from the wood fuels the VR used in its early years. However, the last two locomotives, built in the 1880s, had a conventional single firebox.|$|E

25|$|In 1813, the South Engine Drain was routed {{under the}} Torne through a <b>syphon,</b> {{and became the}} third of the Three Rivers. The 1887 Ordnance Survey map shows only the Torne flowing eastwards from Pilfrey Bridge. As it {{approaches}} Althorpe, it splits into two, and uses both of the sluices into the Trent. The Folly Drain turns {{to the south and}} joins the Trent at Derrythorpe. By 1946/51, maps show a connection between the Torne and the middle of the Three Rivers, with a connection between the middle channel and the east channel downstream of Pilfrey Bridge. By 1966, the channels are inter-connected much as they are today, with a sluice between the Folly Drain and the South Engine Drain, and the sluices at Althorpe and Derrythorpe no longer used.|$|E
25|$|Next {{to cross}} are the Doncaster to Gainsborough railway {{line and the}} B1396 road at Auckley Bridge. The Aldam Drain drains Cantley Low Common, and beyond the junction, the river becomes a high level carrier, with {{permanent}} embanking of both banks, and catchwater drains running along the foot of both banks. At Candy Farm there are two pumping stations, the southern one pumping the Black Bank Drain into the river, and the northern one pumping the East Ring Drain. At Tunnel Pits, there are two more pumping stations, and Tunnel Pits Bridge carries the road which follows Vermuyden's North Idle Drain over the channel. Soon, the South Engine Drain is running parallel to the river, as it crosses under Sandtoft Road and the M180 motorway. As it turns to the east again, the Folly Drain also runs parallel, but a little beyond the A161 bridge, the two drains continue to the east, while the river diverts to the north, to run parallel to the North Engine Drain. The Hatfield Waste Drain runs parallel to the North Engine Drain on its south bank, but after the approach on the Torne, there was nowhere for it to go, and so it passes under the North Engine Drain to its north bank through a grade II listed <b>syphon,</b> which was probably built by Samual Foster in 1795 or by Thackray in 1813 {{as part of a}} series of improvements recommended by the engineer John Rennie.|$|E

500|$|<b>Syphon</b> Filter is a third-person shooter stealth {{video game}} {{developed}} by Eidetic {{and published by}} 989 Studios for PlayStation. It is the first game in the <b>Syphon</b> Filter series, the plot centres on special agents Gabriel [...] "Gabe" [...] Logan and Lian Xing who are tasked by the United States government to apprehend an international terrorist from Germany.|$|E
500|$|Development on <b>Syphon</b> Filter {{began with}} the {{intention}} of creating a new [...] "super-spy" [...] genre hybrid that contained elements of stealth-action and puzzle solving. The game was almost cancelled several times during development as Eidetic faced many difficulties {{due to the lack of}} inspiration from others and their inexperience in creating video games. Despite the initial drawbacks faced, <b>Syphon</b> Filter was met with positive reviews from critics upon release, mostly directed at its innovation and immersive plot.|$|E
500|$|According to {{creative}} director John Garvin, <b>Syphon</b> Filter was originally conceived as [...] "just a name" [...] from a producer at 989 Studios. Initially, {{there was no}} plot, character or gameplay from the original one page synopsis. Eidetic decided to set <b>Syphon</b> Filter as a new 'stealth-action' hybrid that focused heavily on weapons, gadgets and stealth. The team's lead designer was influenced over Rare's successful GoldenEye 007 for the Nintendo 64, and implemented the game's mechanics to have a similar feel for a new [...] "super spy" [...] genre.|$|E
50|$|On 6 August 1897 the Bute Docks Company {{became the}} Cardiff Railway Company, {{and the line}} between Heath Junction and Treforest was opened. This opening was filled with difficulties, because Treforest Junction was on the Taff Vale Railway, {{at the same point}} as the TVR's {{junction}} with the Barry Railway. Here the Barry <b>syphoned</b> off large amounts of coal traffic for transport to Barry Docks. The TVR had no intention of allowing more to be <b>syphoned</b> off by another company, and so it defied the Act of Parliament which had authorised the junction and appealed against its opening {{on the grounds that it}} was unsafe.|$|R

500|$|<b>Syphon</b> Filter {{received}} [...] "critical acclaim" [...] reviews, {{according to}} video game review aggregator Metacritic. Edge stated that, although the game borrows elements from both GoldenEye 007 and Metal Gear Solid and that [...] "the execution {{could have been}} better accomplished, Eidetic [...] a few ideas of its own, and these {{go a long way}} towards providing the game with its own identity." [...] The blend of a stealth-action hybrid gameplay was praised by most critics. Doug Perry of IGN enjoyed the implemented skill-based action that he considered was [...] "hard to come by in a PlayStation game". Perry praised the game's detail and advanced graphics, but criticised the low resolution and noting that the game's frame rate was [...] "not perfect". Despite this, he noted that what <b>Syphon</b> Filter [...] "gives up in frame rate [...] provides in character and environment detail".|$|E
500|$|In {{terms of}} video games, Monolith drew {{inspiration}} {{from a number of}} stealth/action games, such as Metal Gear Solid (1998), [...] (1998), <b>Syphon</b> Filter (1999), and GoldenEye 007 (1997), because the team was [...] "interested in a blend of stealth and action rather than focusing on one or the other exclusively." [...] The original release of the 1981 stealth game Castle Wolfenstein was also cited as being influential.|$|E
500|$|The {{effect of}} {{drainage}} {{on the light}} peaty soils was that further shrinkage occurred, and land levels continued to fall. By the late 1920s, gravity discharge alone {{could no longer be}} relied upon to provide an adequate level of flood protection, and a change to pumped drainage began. A new sluice and pumping station were constructed at St Germans, which was completed in 1934. The sluice was built in the centre of the old <b>syphon</b> sluice channel, with a pumping station on either side of it. Three pump sets were installed, with space for a fourth. Each consisted of a [...] Crossley diesel engine coupled to an [...] Gwynnes pump, which could pump 840 tons per minute (1,234 megalitres per day [...] ). Once completed, the <b>syphon</b> sluice was demolished, while Hawkshaw's replacement sluice and its channel were abandoned. The new works were paid for by a grant, given on condition that three quarters of the workforce were from the local area. The capacity of the station was increased in 1951, when a [...] Crossley diesel engine was fitted into the spare bay, and again in 1969–70, when the two pumps {{on the north side of}} the sluice were rebuilt, and the engines replaced by [...] electric motors.|$|E

500|$|The team {{experienced}} immense {{difficulty in}} creating the game, as Garvin noted that there were [...] "no, or few, games" [...] from which Eidetic could draw inspiration. Most {{of the team that}} developed <b>Syphon</b> Filter had little experience with making third-person action games, as Eidetic's only video game released for a console was Bubsy 3D, which was released three years prior for the PlayStation and was infamous for being critically panned as one of the worst games of all time. Despite the initial difficulties with staff and lack of experience, Eidetic produced a prototype which involved a shooting segment in an underground. Garvin admitted that the team [...] "didn't know anything about making realistic shooters set in a spy world" [...] as the game came close to being cancelled several times throughout development because the team was missing deadlines, revamping mechanics and changing the story. During development, the team of thirteen re-wrote several drafts as the game was being conceived. The original plot of <b>Syphon</b> Filter was intended as a science-fiction orientated approach and involved a group of kidnapped scientists who were being forced to build a time machine by an unspecified antagonistic organisation. The storyline was radically changed when John Garvin was hired to be art director, later creative director.|$|E
500|$|Water is {{essential}} to a thermal power station to produce the steam needed to turn the steam turbines and generate electricity. Water cycled through the Stella stations' systems {{was taken from the}} River Tyne; after use it was cooled before being discharged back into the river. The North station's water cooling system consisted of four large [...] natural draft cooling tower units, [...] tall and made of reinforced concrete. The South station used a <b>syphon</b> cooling system instead of cooling towers, consisting of five [...] units, made up of five underground pipes, each [...] in diameter, with valves and screens.|$|E
500|$|... 1862 {{was also}} {{the year in which}} the Wiggenhall sluice {{collapsed}} and around [...] of the levels were flooded. Sir John Hawkshaw constructed a new sluice, consisting of a large cofferdam, with 16 tubes, each [...] in diameter, which passed over the top of it. The tops of these pipes were [...] above the inlet and outlet, and an air pump was used to remove the air from them, so that the water would <b>syphon</b> over the cofferdam. It was the only time that such a solution was tried in the Fens, and it was supplemented in 1880 by a more conventional gravity sluice, also constructed by Hawkshaw, as it was unable to discharge sufficient water.|$|E
