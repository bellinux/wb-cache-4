40|$|It {{is clear}} that there is no {{shortage}} of uncertainty about metacognition in nonhuman animals. The four papers in this special issue have raised questions about the evidence for metacognition from many perspectives, ranging from con-cerns about whether existing control procedures unambig-uously <b>specify</b> <b>sources</b> of stimulus control, to models that appear to generate metacognitive patterns of performance without explicitly metacognitive components, to critiques of the entire effort on the grounds that there is no mechanism specified for metacognition.

40|$|We {{process the}} main written output of Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch on Colombia {{covering}} the period 1988 - 2004, recording all numerical conflict information and accounts of specific conflict events.

Problems include failre to <b>specify</b> <b>sources,</b> unclear definitions, an erratic reporting template and a distorted portrayal of conflict dynamics. Accounts of individual events are fairly representative and much more useful and accurate than the statistical information. We disprove a common accusation that Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch rarely criticize the guerrillas, but do find some evidence of anti-government bias. The quantitative human rights and conflict information produced by these organizations for other countries must be viewed with scepticism along with cross-country and time series human rights data based on Amnesty International reports. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the medication knowledge achieved by conventional verbal education and the influence of drug information leaflets in patients with epilepsy. Drug compliance and sources of information of the patients were also examined. Fifty-one adults in an epilepsy outpatient clinic participated this survey. These patients were asked to complete a questionnaire and to <b>specify</b> <b>sources</b> of drug information. Serum drug levels were checked and compared with the self-reported compliance. Then, drug information leaflets were given to patients. In the next follow-up visit, patients were asked to fill out the same questionnaire again. In the baseline assessment, 36 patients (70. 6 %) could accurately list their medications. However, half of patients were not knowledgeable about side effects and did not keep a seizure diary. After provision of drug leaflets, the epilepsy medication assessment score increased from 3. 9 ± 1. 9 to 5. 1 ± 1. 7 (P< 0. 001). In addition, patients reported being compliant most of the time and this matched drug levels. On average, each patient had 2. 8 sources of information and 5 patients used Internet as a tool. Despite achieving good compliance, conventional verbal education did not sufficiently cover drug-related issues. Providing patients with written information apparently increase their medication knowledge and probably enhance seizure control...|$|E

40|$|In European nature {{conservation}} law, Natura 2000 sites are protected towards ensuring biodiversity through {{the conservation of}} natural habitat types and of wild fauna and flora. Anyone planning a potentially harmful activity needs to assess significant effects on a site's conservation objectives. While EU case law currently demands certainty provided by science, we will show that science can never rule out uncertainty. We distinguish three sources of uncertainty: ignorance (inadequate understanding), unpredictability of ecological system behaviour and ambiguity in the science–policy interface. Only ignorance can be solved by science alone. We will <b>specify</b> <b>sources</b> of uncertainty encountered in the significance decision procedure {{as part of the}} assessment of article 6 Habitats Directive. We will explore how they affect the use of knowledge during the three steps of the assessment process, i. e. identification of site conservation objectives, predicting the impact of the planned activity and assessing the significance of any effects on the Natura 2000 site. The claim that certainty has to be provided by science is unrealistic, because policy causes a good deal of uncertainty affecting how science can operate. This is discussed in the light of a common learning process by science and society. The European precautionary principle should not be limited to ignorance alone. Within the precautionary principle risk reduction measures can be allowed and thus uncertainties could be accepted, including those uncertainties caused by unpredictability and ambiguity. Finally we propose strategies to manage uncertainty in {{nature conservation}} and law plannin...|$|E
40|$|Current {{spectrometer}} {{design and}} the increasingly affordable price of field hyperspectral sensors are making feasible their use for water quality monitoring. In this study, we parameterized a semi-analytical algorithm to derive constituent concentrations from field spectroradiometer measurements in ten freshwater reservoirs over two years. In contrast to algorithms parameterized for single airborne or satellite sensor deployments, we optimized the algorithm for robust performance across all reservoirs and for multi-temporal application. Our algorithm produced chlorophyll-a concentration estimates with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 7. 7 mg∙m− 3 over a range of 4 – 135 mg∙m− 3. The model also produced estimates of total suspended solids (TSS) concentration with an RMSE of 4. 0 g∙m− 3 over a range of 0 – 25 g∙m− 3. Choosing a non-linear objective function during inversion reduced variance of residuals in chlorophyll-a and TSS estimates by 20 and 18 percentage points, respectively. Application of our algorithm to two years of data and over ten study sites allowed us to <b>specify</b> <b>sources</b> of suboptimal parameterization and measure the non-stationarity of algorithm performance, analyses difficult for short or single deployments. Suboptimal parameterization, especially of backscatter properties between reservoirs, was the greatest source of error in our algorithm, accounting for 17 %– 20 % of all error. In only one reservoir was time-dependent error apparent. In this reservoir, decreases in TSS over time resulted in less TSS estimate error due to imperfect model parameterization. For future applications, especially with ground-based sensors, model performance can easily be improved by using non-linear inversion procedures and replicating spectral measurements...|$|E
40|$|Our {{original}} plan for writing this essay was to first define academic vocabulary {{and next to}} <b>specify</b> <b>sources</b> of and processes for identifying academic words to teach. We assumed {{that this would be}} a relatively simple task, thinking that we knew a bit about words and vocabulary instruction and believing that we could complete the essay promptly. Not so. When we began the “simple ” task of defining academic vocabulary, it became obvious that there was an entire family of terms surrounding it, many with disparate definitions. We had expected to find a consistent definition—something like “the words students encounter when they read informational texts”—but we soon realized that our sense was not shared by vocabulary scholars and adolescent literacy educators. Thus, the seemingly simple task became complex. In this essay, we address the construct academic vocabulary. We first attempt to bring some clarity to a constellation of terms surrounding academic vocabulary. Second, we compare and contrast definitions of academic vocabulary. Third, we review typologies that researchers and writers have proposed to organize academic vocabulary. Fourth, we present some of the procedures scholars have recommended for identifying academic vocabulary for instruction. Fifth, we present our scheme for classifying and selecting academic vocabulary for instruction and provide an example of how a content teacher might use it. We conclude by recommending a few sources that teachers of adolescents might draw from for teaching academic vocabulary. A Plethora of Terms and Meanings Our search for a definition of academic vocabulary led us to terms that included general academic vocabulary, academic literacy, academic background, general academic words, domain knowledge, academic competence, linguistic knowledge, domain-specific vocabulary...|$|E
