500|$|Xenosaga Episode I was {{developed}} by a core team of between 60 and 80 people, expanding to over 100 people at its most active development period. Among the staff, twenty of them had previously worked on Xenogears. The biggest issue faced when building the team {{was that they were}} developing for the PlayStation 2, a console with far more power than any previous console they had worked on. A major improvement in Takahashi's view over his work on Xenogears was {{that he was able to}} make the entire game using 3D graphics, something he had been unable to do with Xenogears. Due to the amount of preparatory work and getting accustomed to the new hardware, actual development did not start until 2000, lasting approximately a year. Namco provided development support with the motion capture technology. Takahashi later noted that the sheer number of young and inexperienced developers in Monolith <b>Soft</b> <b>negative</b> impacted development, with the graphics engine being completed only six months before the game's release. Prior to its announcement, the game {{was developed}} under the working title [...] "Project X".|$|E
6000|$|They reached Saint-Germain {{with their}} companions {{nearly an hour}} before the time it had been agreed they had best dine; the purpose of this being to enable them to enjoy with what {{remained}} of daylight a stroll on the celebrated terrace and a study of the magnificent view. The evening was splendid and the atmosphere favourable to these impressions; the grass was vivid on the broad walk beside the parapet, the park and forest were fresh and leafy and the prettiest golden light hung over the curving Seine and the far-spreading city. The hill which forms the terrace stretched down among the vineyards, with the poles delicate yet in their bareness, to the river, and the prospect was spotted here and there with the red legs of the little sauntering soldiers of the garrison. How it came, after Delia's warning in regard to her carrying-on--especially as she hadn't failed to feel the weight of her sister's wisdom--Francie couldn't have told herself: certain it is that before ten minutes had elapsed she became aware, first, that the evening wouldn't pass without Mr. Flack's taking in some way, and for a certain time, peculiar possession of her; and then that he was already doing so, that he had drawn her away from the others, who were stopping behind to appreciate the view, that he made her walk faster, and that he had ended by interposing such a distance that she was practically alone with him. This was what he wanted, but it was not all; she saw he now wanted a great many other things. The large perspective of the terrace stretched away before them--Mr. Probert had said it was in the grand style--and he was determined to make her walk to the end. She felt sorry for his ideas--she thought of them in the light of his striking energy; they were an idle exercise of a force intrinsically fine, and she wanted to protest, to let him know how truly it was a sad misuse of his free bold spirit to count on her. She was not to be counted on; she was a vague <b>soft</b> <b>negative</b> being who had never decided anything and never would, who had not even the merit of knowing how to flirt and who only asked to be let alone. She made him stop at last, telling him, while she leaned against the parapet, that he walked too fast; and she looked back at their companions, whom she expected to see, under pressure from Delia, following at the highest speed. But they were not following; they still stood together there, only looking, attentively enough, at the couple who had left them. Delia would wave a parasol, beckon her back, send Mr. Waterlow to bring her; Francie invoked from one moment to another some such appeal as that. But no appeal came; none at least but the odd spectacle, presently, of an agitation of the group, which, evidently under Delia's direction, turned round and retraced its steps. Francie guessed in a moment what was meant by that; it was the most definite signal her sister could have given. It made her feel that Delia counted on her, but to such a different end, just as poor Mr. Flack did, just as Delia wished to persuade her that Mr. Probert did. The girl gave a sigh, looking up with troubled eyes at her companion and at the figure of herself as the subject of contending policies. Such a thankless bored evasive little subject as she felt herself! What Delia had said in turning away was--"Yes, I'm watching you, and I depend on you to finish him up. Stay there with him, go off with him--I'll allow you half an hour if necessary: only settle him once for all. It's very kind of me to give you this chance, and in return for it I expect you {{to be able to tell}} me this evening that he has his answer. Shut him up!" ...|$|E

In the last 20 years, tourism has made a very important contribution to the global economy, being the fastest growing sector in terms of external revenue and new jobs. The economic and financial crisis that has affected the world economy in 2008, has led to decreasing the flow of tourists, but the tourism sector seems to be save by the new tourist that arrives from the emerging countries.

40|$|Hurtful {{events in}} romantic {{relationships}} can have substantial effects on victims {{and on the}} couple bond. The current study investigated the associations of attachment dimensions with conceptually relevant variables, as well as testing a mediation model predicting {{the long-term effects of}} hurtful events on the individual who identifies as the victim. Participants (N = 127) were asked to provide a written description of an event in which their partner had hurt their feelings, and then to answer questions measuring their perceptions of that event, along with other variables of interest on a survey. The hypothesised relationships amongst attachment anxiety and hurt-proneness, rejection sensitivity, rumination and neuroticism were supported; however, after controlling for neuroticism, only the associations with rejection sensitivity and rumination remained significant. Further, the associations of attachment avoidance with rejection sensitivity, suppression and low extraversion were also significant, although only the association with suppression remained significant after controlling for extraversion. For the mediation analyses, results indicated that the association between attachment anxiety and long-term effects on the victim was explained partially by immediate victim responses of <b>soft</b> emotion, <b>negative</b> self-perceptions, sense of rejection and sense of powerlessness, as predicted. However, contrary to prediction, attachment avoidance did not have a direct path to long-term effects on the victim, or indirect paths via low levels of <b>soft</b> emotion or <b>negative</b> self-perception. The results suggest that hurt is a multifaceted experience, with dimensions of attachment security and immediate emotional and cognitive reactions all affecting the long-term effects of hurtful events. The results highlight the complexity of hurt feelings, and future research should examine possible moderators of the relationships between attachment dimensions and long-term effects of hurtful events on the victim...|$|R

40|$|In this work, an electroactive {{polyimide}} (EPI) coating with biomimetic {{surface structure}} of rose petal used in anticorrosion application was first presented. First of all, amino-capped aniline trimer (ACAT) was synthesized by oxidative coupling reaction, followed by characterized through Fourier transform infrared spectroscooy (FTIR), liquid chromatography – mass spcerometry (LC-MS) and proton {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (1 H-NMR) spectroscopy.

Moreover, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) was {{used to be the}} <b>soft</b> <b>negative</b> template for pattern transfer from the surface of rose petal to the surface of polymer coating. The EPI coating with biomimetic structure was obtained by programmed heating the EPAA slurry casting onto the negative PDMS template. The anticorrosive performance of as-prepared biomimetic EPI coating was demonstrated by performing a series of electrochemical measurements (Tafel, Nyquist, and Bode plots) upon cold-rolled steel (CRS) electrode in a NaCl aqueous solution. It {{should be noted that the}} biomimetic EPI coating with rose petal-like structure was found to exhibit better anticorrosion than that of EPI without biomimetic structure. Moreover, the surface contact angle of water droplets for biomimetic EPI coating was found to be ~ 150 °, which is significantly higher than that of EPI coating with smooth structure (~ 87 °), indicating that the EPI coating with biomimetic structure reveals better hydrophobicity. The apparent mechanism for improved anticorrosive properties is twofold: (1) the biomimetic structure of EPI coating can repel water droplets. (2) electroactivity of EPI coating promotes the formation of densely passive layer of metal oxide on metallic surface...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} semihard {{magnetic}} phases and interfaces {{on the performance}} of nanostructured two-phase permanent magnets is investigated by model calculations. In addition to the trivial coercivity increase due to the replacement of soft regions by semihard regions, there is a coercivity enhancement even if the volume-averaged anisotropy is kept constant during the introduction of the semihard phase. A variational approach is used to derive analytical results for representative anisotropy profiles. The improvement is operative on length scales slightly larger than that of the soft phase in hard-soft composites, but the main challenge is to find semihard light or heavy transition metal phases with a high magnetization. There are several Fe- and Co-based phases, but most are thin-film systems and difficult to use in bulk magnets.

Piggyback contact lens fittings combining Senofilcon-A soft lenses of − 6. 00, − 3. 00, + 3. 00 and + 6. 00 D with Rose K 2 RGP contact lenses were performed. Corneal topography was taken on the naked eye and over each soft contact lens before fitting RGP lenses. Mean central keratometry, over-refraction, RGP back optic zone radius (BOZR) and estimated final power as well as VA were recorded and analyzed. Results: In comparison to the naked eye, the mean central keratometry flattened with both negative lens powers (p 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract. Replacement of {{a carbon}} atom of an {{aromatic}} compound {{by a more}} electronegative heteroatom gives rise to suppression of reactivities of the remaining carbon atoms in electrophilic substitution (SE 2) reactions. To prove this experiment-based rule, the reactivities {{are related to the}} relevant extents of the intermolecular charge transfer. General algebraic expressions are derived and analyzed for these extents for various directions of the attack of electrophile. The reactant is considered as a perturbed alternant hydrocarbon, the perturbation coinciding with the alteration in the Coulomb parameter of the carbon atom undergoing the replacement, whereas the reagent is represented explicitly by an external vacant orbital. Changes in the intermolecular charge transfer due to introduction of heteroatom are shown to consist of two components, viz. of an initial-population-dependent component contributing increments of alternating signs for shifting positions of electrophile along the hydrocarbon chain and of an additional negative contribution originating from the increased interval between diagonal Hamiltonian matrix elements for orbitals participating in the charge transfer. For <b>soft</b> electrophiles, the <b>negative</b> contribution is shown to predominate over the alternating one. This implies the charge transfer between heteroaromatic reactants and electrophiles to be suppressed vs. the relevant values for hydrocarbons-containing system. (doi: 10. 5562 /cca 1794...|$|R
40|$|Classical {{schizophrenia}} {{literature reports}} motor symptoms as {{characteristic of the}} disorder.

Reports focused on abnormal involuntary movements, parkinsonism, neurological <b>soft</b> signs, catatonia, <b>negative</b> symptoms, or psychomotor slowing. Since these syndromes refer to different concepts, however, the definitions are not congruent and the symptoms overlap. The prevalence rates of motor symptoms in schizophrenia are surprisingly high, and recent studies indicate a possible pathobiology. In particular, the development and maturation of the human motor system appears to be {{closely linked to the}} emergence of motor symptoms observed in schizophrenia. Post-mortem and neuroimaging results demonstrated aberrant structure and function of premotor and motor cortices, basal ganglia, thalamus, and the connecting white matter tracts. Animal models have focused on aberrant neurotransmission and genetic contributions. Findings of localized abnormal oligodendrocyte function and myelination point to the special role of the white matter in schizophrenia, and recent studies specifically found an association between motor abnormalities and white matter structure in schizophrenia. This review of the literature supports the idea that motor symptoms are closely related to the neurodevelopmental disturbances of schizophrenia and a distinct syndromal dimension with its own pathophysiology...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{describes}} spin-wave excitations in nanosized {{dots and}} rings {{in the presence}} of the vortex state. The special attention is paid to the manifestation of the competition between exchange and dipolar interactions in the spin-wave spectrum as well as the correlation between the spectrum and the stability of the vortex. The calculation method uses the dynamic matrix for an all-discrete system, the numerical diagonalization of which yields the spectrum of frequencies and spin-wave profiles of normal modes of the dot. We study in-plane vortices of two types: a circular magnetization in circular dots and rings and the Landau state in square rings. We examine the influence of the dipolar-exchange competition and the geometry of the dot on the stability of the vortex and on the spectrum of spin waves. We show that the lowest-frequency mode profile proves to be indicative of the dipolar-to-exchange interaction ratio and the vortex stability is closely related to the spin-wave profile of the <b>soft</b> mode. The <b>negative</b> dispersion relation is also shown. Our results obtained for in-plane vortices are in qualitative agreement with results for core-vortices obtained from experiments, micromagnetic simulations, and analytical calculations.

40|$|The chemodynamics {{of metal}} {{complexes}} with nanoparticulate complexants can {{differ significantly from}} that for simple ligands. The spatial confinement of charged sites and binding sites to the nanoparticulate body impacts on the time scales of various steps in the overall complex formation process. The greater the charge carried by the nanoparticle, the longer it takes {{to set up the}} counterion distribution equilibrium with the medium. A z+ metal ion (z > 1) in a 1 : 1 background electrolyte will accumulate in the counterionic atmosphere around negatively charged simple ions, as well as within/around the body of a <b>soft</b> nanoparticle with <b>negative</b> structural charge. The rate of accumulation is often governed by diffusion and proceeds until Boltzmann partition equilibrium between the charged entity and the ions in the medium is attained. The electrostatic accumulation proceeds simultaneously with outer-sphere and inner-sphere complex formation. The rate of the eventual inner-sphere complex formation is generally controlled by the rate constant of dehydration of the metal ion, kw. For common transition metal ions with moderate to fast dehydration rates, e. g., Cu 2 +, Pb 2 +, and Cd 2 +, it is shown that the ionic equilibration with the medium may be the slower step and thus rate-limiting in their overall complexation with nanoparticle...|$|R
40|$|Replacement of {{a carbon}} atom of an {{aromatic}} compound {{by a more}} electronegative heteroatom gives rise to suppression of reactivities of the remaining carbon atoms in electrophilic substitution (SE 2) reactions. To prove this experiment-based rule, the reactivities {{are related to the}} relevant extents of the intermolecular charge transfer. General algebraic expressions are derived and analyzed for these extents for various directions of the attack of electrophile. The reactant is considered as a perturbed alternant hydrocarbon, the perturbation coinciding with the alteration in the Coulomb parameter of the carbon atom undergoing the replacement, whereas the reagent is represented explicitly by an external vacant orbital. Changes in the intermolecular charge transfer due to introduction of heteroatom are shown to consist of two components, viz. of an initial-population-dependent component contributing increments of alternating signs for shifting positions of electrophile along the hydrocarbon chain and of an additional negative contribution originating from the increased interval between diagonal Hamiltonian matrix elements for orbitals participating in the charge transfer. For <b>soft</b> electrophiles, the <b>negative</b> contribution is shown to predominate over the alternating one. This implies the charge transfer between heteroaromatic reactants and electrophiles to be suppressed vs. the relevant values for hydrocarbons-containing system. (doi: 10. 5562 /cca 1794...|$|R
40|$|Neurological soft {{signs are}} {{biological}} traits that underlie schizophrenia and {{are found to}} occur at higher levels in at-risk individuals. The expression of neurological soft signs may be modifiable during {{the onset of the}} first psychotic episode and the subsequent evolution of the illness and its treatment. This study investigates neurological soft signs in 138 patients with first-episode schizophrenia and tracks the expression of motor soft signs in the following 3 years. For the 93 patients who have completed the 3 -year follow-up, we find that neurological soft signs are stable in the 3 years that follow the first psychotic episode, and that neurological soft signs are already elevated at the presentation of first-episode psychosis in medication-naïve subjects. The level of neurological soft signs at clinical stabilization is lower for patients with a shorter duration of untreated psychosis. Although the quantity of neurological soft signs does not significantly change in the 3 years that follow the first episode, the relationship between neurological <b>soft</b> signs and <b>negative</b> symptoms does not become apparent until 1 year after the initial episode. A higher level of neurological soft signs is related to a lower educational level and an older age at onset, but the level of neurological soft signs does not predict the outcome in terms of relapse or occupational functioning. © 2004 Elsevier B.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{applies the}} concept of social norm {{dynamics}} to explain how corporate governance soft law is enforced. Design/methodology/approach: Using data of German listed stock companies and of economic media coverage between 2001 and 2010, we observe the complex relationship between sanctions and behavior in {{the social context of}} corporate governance soft law. Findings: We find that the public discussion of normative demands related to corporate governance issues increases if firms do not comply with the German Corporate Governance Code. We show that groups of actors, such as DAX companies, represent the addressees of normative demands, i. e., targets of expectations about what is appropriate and what is not. We also find that normative demands tend to be personalized, as public discussion is greater when initiated by a specific individual or firm. Finally, we demonstrate that social control in terms of public sanctioning positively influences a firm’s compliance with the <b>soft</b> law, whereby <b>negative</b> statements (disapproval) outweigh the effects of positive statements (approval). Originality/ value: We corroborate the social character of normative demands in the context of corporate governance soft law, and contribute {{to a better understanding of}} why soft law can work despite its having no legally binding force. The results of our study suggest that sanction mechanisms in the context of social norms underpin the strength of soft law as an alternative to, or extension of, hard law...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Retroperitoneal schwannomas are a rare disease. During {{the potent}} {{antiretroviral}} therapy era, {{the incidence of}} AIDS-defining cancers has decreased, while the incidence of non-AIDS defining cancers has increased; however, {{the existence of a}} relationship between benign or malignant schwannomas and AIDS remains unclear. Although a case of ethmoid malignant schwannoma in an AIDS patient was first reported in 1993, no additional reports of schwannomas asso-ciated with AIDS have been published since. In the current study, the case of a 30 -year-old male AIDS patient with a large benign retroperitoneal schwannoma is presented. The ideal treatment of retroperitoneal schwannomas is complete excision. However, controversy exists over the necessity of <b>negative</b> <b>soft</b> tissue margins, particularly when adjacent tissue or viscera must also be removed. In the current case study, due to the immune dysfunction in AIDS patients, the incidence of malignancy could not be completely excluded prior to surgery and a significant risk of short-term relapse or malignancy following partial tumor resection was present. The patient underwent complete resection with partial superior mesen-teric artery excision in order to attain negative margins, and recovered well. A follow-up was performed 1 year after the procedure and the patient was well and a CT scan demon-strated no evidence of recurrence. However, the long term efficacy of this procedure requires continued observation in this patient...|$|R
