40|$|International audienceWe present Bezel-Tap Gestures, a novel {{family of}} {{interaction}} techniques for immediate interaction on handheld tablets {{regardless of whether}} the device is alive or in sleep mode. The technique rests on the close succession of two input events: first a bezel tap, whose detection by accelerometers will awake an idle tablet almost instantly, then a screen contact. Field studies confirmed that the probability of this input sequence occurring by chance is very low, excluding the accidental activation concern. One experiment examined the optimal size of the vocabulary of commands for all four regions of the bezel (top, bottom, left, right). Another experiment evaluated two variants of the technique which both allow two-level selection in a hierarchy of commands, the initial bezel tap being followed by either two screen taps or a screen slide.

5000|$|On September 11, 2007, Sepracor {{signed a}} {{marketing}} deal with British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline {{for the rights}} to sell Eszopiclone (under the name Lunivia rather than Lunesta) in Europe. Sepracor was expected to receive approximately 155 million dollars if the deal went through. In 2008 Sepracor submitted an application to the EMA (the European Union's equivalent to the U.S. FDA) for authorization to market the drug in the EU, and initially received a favourable response. [...] However, Sepracor withdrew its authorization application in 2009 after the EMA stated it would not be granting eszopiclone 'new active substance' status, as it was essentially pharmacologically and therapeutically too similar to zopiclone to be considered a new patentable product. Since zopiclone's patent has expired, this ruling would have allowed rival companies to also legally produce cheaper generic versions of eszopiclone for the European market. , Sepracor has not resubmitted its authorization application and Lunesta/Lunivia is not available in Europe. The deal with GSK fell through, and GSK instead launched a $3.3 billion deal to market Actelion's Almorexant <b>sleeping</b> <b>tablet,</b> which entered stage three medical trials before development was abandoned due to side effects.|$|R
40|$|Insomnia {{has been}} defined as a {{difficulty}} initiating or maintaining sleep, leading to sleep that is either insufficient or unrefreshing. It is well-established that insomnia is more common in people with dementia, {{but it is not clear}} if insomnia predates dementia in these individuals. This latter question is an important one: if it can be shown that people with insomnia are more likely to develop dementia in later life, this may improve our ability to predict an individual’s dementia risk, and possibly to help manage that risk. Several recent studies have found a link between insomnia and later dementia, but typically give little information about the time between the onset of insomnia and the onset of dementia, raising the possibility that the insomnia is an early symptom of dementia, rather than a risk factor or potential cause of the disease. Furthermore, in some studies the link between insomnia and dementia becomes weaker when factors such as depression and <b>sleeping</b> <b>tablet</b> use are taken into account. The proposed study uses primary care records to learn whether people with dementia are more likely to have consulted with their general practitioner (GP) about insomnia 5 - 10 years earlier, compared to those who do not have dementia...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the clinical and cost impact of providing cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for insomnia (comprising sleep hygiene, stimulus control, relaxation and cognitive therapy components) to long-term hypnotic drug users in general practice. DESIGN: A pragmatic {{randomised controlled trial}} with two treatment arms (a CBT treated 'sleep clinic' group, and a 'no additional treatment' control group), with post-treatment assessments commencing at 3 and 6 months. SETTING: Twenty-three general practices in Sheffield, UK. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred and nine serially referred patients aged 31 - 92 years with chronic sleep problems who had been using hypnotic drugs for at least 1 month (mean duration = 13. 4 years). RESULTS: At 3 - and 6 -month follow-ups patients treated with CBT reported significant reductions in sleep latency, significant improvements in sleep efficiency, and significant reductions {{in the frequency of}} hypnotic drug use (all P< 0. 01). Among CBT treated patients SF- 36 scores showed significant improvements in vitality at 3 months (P< 0. 01). Older age presented no barrier to successful treatment outcomes. The total cost of service provision was 154. 40 per patient, with a mean incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year of 3416 (at 6 months). However, there was evidence of longer term cost offsets owing to reductions in <b>sleeping</b> <b>tablet</b> use and reduced utilisation of primary care services. CONCLUSIONS: In routine general practice settings, psychological treatments for insomnia can improve sleep quality and reduce hypnotic consumption at a favourable cost among long-term hypnotic users with chronic sleep difficulties...|$|R

40|$|Background Nantes University Hospital {{comprises}} 20 activity sectors. Aims To {{investigate the}} role of the work environment at the individual level, as well as the workplace level, in explaining the variability in employees’ perception of stress. Methods A self-administered enhanced Karasek Job Content Questionnaire was sent to employees. The main variables were the psychological job demand (PJD) score and the job decision latitude (JDL) score. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to estimate crude odds ratio (OR) and adjusted OR. Results One thousand eight hundred and sixty-eight workers were included. Nursing managers (25. 9 ± 3. 4), non-specialized nurses (25. 6 ± 3. 5) and physicians (25. 3 ± 3. 4) had the highest PJD. Cleaning staff (61. 4 ± 11. 4) and nurse aides (63. 6 ± 8. 8) had the lowest JDL. Items correlated with high PJD are: unacceptable work schedule, adjusted OR 2. 16 (95 % CI = 1. 3 – 3. 5); unsatisfactory workstation accessibility, OR 1. 92 (95 % CI = 1. 1 – 3. 2); getting from A to B, OR 1. 67 (95 % CI = 1. 2 – 2. 4); and heavy manual handling, OR 1. 62 (95 % CI = 1. 1 – 2. 3). <b>Sleeping</b> <b>tablet</b> use was linked to high PJD (P 40 years old, nurse managers, physicians, permanent and/or full-time workers having a high PJD.

40|$|MONSTROSITIES {{have formed}} {{the bases of}} legends and myths {{transmitted}} through the centuries {{by word of mouth}} even before man-kind learned how to transmute thought into visible form. The birth omens of antiquity, cen-tering around congenital defects, constitute some of the oldest medical records known, and we find phocomelia type malformation mentioned in the Assyrian-Babylonian literature inscribed upon clay tablets 2, 500 years ago. Any monster was an alarming admonition of misfortune. In Greek mythology deformities related to phocomelia have been signified in the harpies and sirens of the Odyssey and of Plutarch’s &dquo;Lives&dquo;; and they were pictured in the demonology of the Dutch painter, Heironymus Bosch &dquo;the Joyous&dquo; (1460 - 1516), in the 15 th century. Thus there is plenty of evidence that phoco-melia occurred long before anyone thought of thalidamide as one of the causes. The incidence, however, was very low before thalidamide was utilized as a <b>sleeping</b> <b>tablet</b> in 1959 followed by a sudden epidemic of about 3, 000 to 4, 000 cases in Germany. The public reaction was a prime illustration of the terrific impact monstrosities can make upon the mind. Hippocrates called congenitally short armed children &dquo;weasel-armed&dquo;; but the term phoco-melia compares the abbreviated limbs to the flip-pers of seals. Some of these individuals have lived long, like the famous &dquo;Petit Pepin,&dquo; Marco Ca-tozze (Fig. 1), the circus freak who died in Paris in 1800 at the age of 62 and then continued his exhibitionist career as a specimen in the Dupuy-tren Museum alongside the body of an infant with the same condition.

Vandana comes to know of it and fakes a doctor and gives his number to Manoj to call him for his remedy. Manoj does so and he claims 5 lakhs for the treatment. Manoj is tempted to steal from the office, upon Vandana's advise and leaves for Bangalore for treatment. Here UnniKrishnan is suspected for the money loss and police eventually investigate him in a function {{in front of the other}} relative which puts him in embarrassment.

Knowing that Priya has absconded with Pooja, Vandana adds a feather to her cap making her side stronger and filing a criminal charge against the Priya for her act. After twists of events, Priya gets back to Arjun family with her broken leg (in the accident meanwhile). The next day hearing proceeds and Vandana succeeds in getting Pooja into her custody. Adhi sees Vandana's lawyer in his school function and picks up a quarrel with his son, blaming his father as a prosecutor who helped Vandana in separating Priya from Pooja. But his son counters saying his father is rather a great, honest and a fair lawyer. Now Vandana's lawyer become conscientious learning about his own son's belief about him, feels guilty for being otherwise. He then promises to support Priya to get back her child and Priya becomes highly delightful. Meanwhile, Adhi develops a complex and is heartbroken thinking that he is unwanted by Vandana as well as Arjun's family and bursts out to Arjun about it. Moreover, the psychiatrist advises Adhi to be in Priya's custody for his better future and for his better mental health. Arjun then decides to retain Adhi first and then to fight for Pooja's custody later.|$|R
