40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effect of high and low anxiety on {{motivation}} for treatment, length of stay in treatment, and intrapsychic focus of attention in Veterans Administration drug-abuse patients. The dependent variables were measured by the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), Reasons For Seeking Treatment Inventory (RFST), State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Psychopathic State Inventory (PSI), and the total number of days each <b>subject</b> participated <b>in</b> the treatment program. The major hypothesis was stated in the null form. The PSI and the STAI were used to measure motivation for seeking treatment. The MMPI and the RFST were used to measure intrapsychic focus of attention.

40|$|In {{the first}} two studies, {{subjects}} were induced into a positive, negative or neutral mood using the Velten mood induction procedure, and then exposed to information about an attitude object they knew little about. According to Bower 2 ̆ 7 s mood-congruity hypothesis, <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> a good mood should remember more of the positive information, whereas <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> a negative mood should remember more of the negative information. Because of this differential recall of material, <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> a good mood should form a more favourable attitude than <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> a negative mood. The material that subjects remembered did not conform to these predictions. Still, mood influenced the attitudes <b>subjects</b> formed. <b>In</b> the first study, <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> a good mood showed more positive attitude change than other <b>subjects,</b> while <b>in</b> the second study, <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> a negative mood reported a more negative attitude. Finally, when given {{a list of the}} original statements, <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> the first experiment evaluated them {{in a manner consistent with}} their mood. These results are consistent with predictions derived from the reinforcement-affect model.;In the last two studies, the effect of mood on existing attitudes was examined. In the third study, subjects were divided into three attitude groups (positive, neutral and negative) on the basis of their responses to a pre-experimental attitude measure. Under the influence of the Velten mood cards, subjects were asked to rate their attitude toward being religious and to list any advantages and disadvantages of being religious. Contrary to Bower 2 ̆ 7 s model, <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> a good mood did not recall more advantages nor did <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> a bad mood recall more disadvantages. Still, among subjects who were neutral towards religion and who rated their attitude toward being religious before listing their beliefs, elated subjects expressed a more positive attitude than others. In the fourth study, in which extreme attitude subjects were excluded, <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> a negative mood showed more negative attitude change than other subjects. Evaluation ratings, whether of statements subjects generated (study 3) or from a list of statements provided by the experimenter (study 4), were not influenced by mood...|$|R

40|$|Based on the {{assumption}} that there are no referential null <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> the Germanic V 2 -languages, it has been claimed that the V 2 -property is universally in-compatible with referential null <b>subjects.</b> However, <b>in</b> this paper it is demonstrated that referential null <b>subjects</b> occur <b>in</b> several Old Germanic languages as well as in a number of non-standard Modern Germanic vernaculars, all of them V 2 -languages. Hence the assumed connection between V 2 -word order and non-present referential null subjects can be refuted. It is also shown that the referential null <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> the two groups of languages (Old and Modern) display different syntactic properties, in several respects. Hence it is plausible that the referential null <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> the two language groups belong to typologically different types, which in turn leads {{to the conclusion that the}} referential null <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> the modern vernaculars are syntactic innovations, rather than remnants of an archaic syntactic system. 1.
