40|$|Abstract Background Stress {{shielding}} of {{the proximal}} femur {{has been observed}} {{in a number of}} conventional cementless implants used in total hip arthroplasty. Short femoral-neck implants are claiming less interference with the biomechanics of the proximal femur. The goal {{of this study was to}} investigate the changes of bone-mineral density in the proximal femur and the clinical outcome after implantation of a short femoral-neck prosthesis. Methods We prospectively assessed the clinical outcome and the changes of bone mineral density of the proximal femur up to one year after implantation of a short femoral neck prosthesis in 20 patients with a mean age of 47 years (range 17 to 65). Clinical outcome was assessed using the Harris Hip Score. The WOMAC was used as a patient-relevant outcome-measure. The bone mineral density was determined using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, performed 10 days, three months and 12 months after surgery. Results The Harris Hip Score improved from an average preoperative score of 46 to a postoperative score at 12 months of 89 points, the global WOMAC index from 5, 3 preoperatively to 0, 8 at 12 months postoperatively. In contrast to conventional implants, the DEXA-scans overall revealed a slight increase of bone mineral density in the proximal femur in the 12 months following the implantation. Conclusion The short femoral neck <b>stem</b> <b>lead</b> to a distinct bone reaction. This was significantly different when compared to the changes in bone mineral density reported after implantation of conventional implants. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} hydraulic limitations associated with long, tall stems. Longer <b>stems</b> may <b>lead</b> to decreased water delivery to leaves due to increased friction against the walls of the conduit, and taller <b>stems</b> <b>lead</b> to decreased water delivery due to increased hydrostatic pressure at greater heights. Leaves that receive less water must close stomata to avoid cavitation, and thus limit uptake and growth rates. Although both of these limitations have been demonstrated to lead to reduced growth in trees, there is evidence that some vines can compensate. I hypothesize that despite growing long stems, kudzu is able to maintain high rates of gas exchange and photosynthesis regardless of leaf position. This is accomplished through hydraulic compensations that manifest in structural changes of the conducting tissue along the pathway. I observed only a slight (11 %) decline in stomatal conductance as expected, but was unable to predict the small decline with height based on structural and hydraulic changes to the vine. Across treatment groups, leaf area increases with path length, so equal water delivery to each leaf would result in less water per unit leaf area to distal leaves, suggesting kudzu does not compensate by adjusting the sapwood to leaf area ratio. To compensate by increasing the driving force, leaf water potential would need to fall below the wilting point. To compensate by decreasing hydraulic resistance, kudzu stems would need to be two orders of magnitude more conductive than measured. Since the total amount of water storage in kudzu based on volume is too small to maintain water supply for 20 minutes, leaves cannot rely on capacitance to compensate for slow delivery through the stem. I am unable to describe the mechanism that allows kudzu to maintain high gas exchange and growth rates in distal leaves. Thesi...|$|R

3000|$|Another {{reason the}} disease has not been well-detected {{in its early stages}} is because its cycle {{consists}} of a number of alternative and consecutive events: Firstly, there must be an injury to expose the wood. The cells around the injured area oxidize and discolour due to biochemical changes. This discolouration can develop further if the wound remains open to the many microorganisms which can land and grow on the moisture. The next most likely step is for bacteria and Ascomycetes or imperfect fungi to live on the wound, resulting in further discolouration, wetness of the area and erosion of parts of the cell wall. This is referred to as wetwood, redheart, or blackheart. Finally, as the wood-rotting fungi (Basidiomycetes) integrate, digestion of cell wall components begins. These microorganisms, however, are confined to the area which is already undergone the biochemical processes followed by bacterial reaction, Ascomycetes and imperfects.

40|$|Plants are {{constantly}} subjected to external mechanical loads such as wind, rain or even neighbours. These stimuli {{are known to}} affect {{the growth of the}} plants, a process called thigmomorphogenesis (Jaffe et al. 2002, Braam 2005, Telewski 2006).

Among the different hypothesis found in the literature to account for this long-distance transport (electrical signal, hormone transport), it has been proposed that local mechanical stimuli, like bending, could generate a hydraulic signal that could move through the xylem (Malone 1994, Julien 1993, Farmer et al 2014). Recently, such hydro/mechanical couplings have been directly observed by Lopez et al (2014), who showed that bending a whole living tree or a cut branch generates almost simultaneously an overpressure pulse in the vascular system.

40|$|AbstractSugarcane grows {{comparatively}} {{slowly in}} dry mass during both {{the early and}} the late part of its growth period. Rate of leaf production increases less with temperature than in other tall warm-climate grasses. This leads to a comparatively low rate of tillering, and a delayed start of stem elongation. Consequently, there is a comparatively lengthy period of ‘lost time’ before the stimulus of the elongating <b>stem</b> <b>leads</b> {{to an increase in}} dry mass growth rate. The slow growth during the late part of the growth period is associated with a decrease in rate of stem elongation and an increase in the mass of non-structural material in the stem. Rate of respiration (total ‘dark’, and maintenance) is lower at normal temperature than other warm-climate grasses. A low rate of maintenance respiration should decrease the fraction of assimilate that must be expended to maintain the large non-structural mass in the stem. The slow stem elongation during the late part of the growth period might be indicative of a decrease in rate of respiration, reflecting rate of metabolism, hence of synthesis of structural dry mass, to the benefit of storage of sucrose. The growth pattern of sugarcane may be ‘optimal’ for maximising sucrose yield, balancing delayed growth with decreased respiratory carbon loss...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of ChemistryJun LiThis {{study is}} focused on {{exploring}} the mechanisms of DNA dynamics at carbon electrode surfaces under a strong electric field {{for the development of}} novel DNA hybridization sensors. Oligonucleotides with FAM 6 attached at the distal end are covalently tethered on the carbon electrode surface. The fluorescence emission from the FAM 6 is strongly quenched in close proximity to the electrode surface. The modulation to the fluorescence intensity is correlated with the reversible reorientation of the negatively charged DNA molecules under the electric field within the electric double layer. The orientation dynamics are apparently determined by the interplay of the electropotential, salt concentration, and stiffness of the DNA molecules. We have observed that dsDNAs switch with fast dynamics (in 0. 1 second) when the electric field is altered by stepping the electropotential to a more positive or negative value. The DNA reorientation exhibits strong dependence on the PBS buffer concentration and electric double layer thickness. A preliminary calculation based on dipole-surface energy transfer theory indicates that the critical distance between FAM 6 and glassy carbon surface is 10. 95 nm. In connection with the fluorescence study, the effect of DNA hybridization on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has also been investigated by two methods in an attempt to develop a fast electronic detection method. First, EIS at high AC amplitude (141 mV rms) with DNA-modified glassy carbon electrodes before and after target DNA hybridization have shown notable change at high frequencies, likely related to the DNA reorientation processes. Second, reversible EIS detection of DNA hybridization has been demonstrated with patterned regular carbon nanofiber arrays at normal AC amplitude (10 mV rms). The combination of these two methods will be explored in future studies.

Sixty-three first year psychology students participated in the study. On the basis of pre-determined domain knowledge scores, participants were categorized as high or low domain knowledge.

The first factor was treatment with three levels (i. e., generic question stems, signal words, and unguided questioning); the second factor was domain knowledge with two levels (i. e., high domain knowledge and low domain knowledge); and the third factor was text coherence with two levels (i. e., high text coherence and low text coherence). Participants were administered four measures: a pre- and post-treatment sorting task; a short answer post-test; a summary recall measure; and a calibration of comprehension task. Results {{of this study suggest}} that high domain knowledge and structured questioning strategies are the most reliable predictors of text memory and text learning. Several main effects favouring high domain knowledge arose on text memory, and to a lesser extent, text learning measures. Significant results involving signal words and generic question stems were detected primarily through interaction effects and one main effect. While not always significantly superior, generic question stem participants outperformed their signal word and unguided questioning counterparts on the majority of text memory and text learning variables.
