Thermal modelling revealed that the critical spot limiting the ampacity {{of this type of}} cable joint is located on its crosslinked polyethylene (XLPE) insulation section. The axial distribution of the thermal field in this type of cable joint was also determined. An algorithm for assessing ampacity in this type of cable joint was developed. Experiments were conducted on a real cable system with a prefabricated <b>straight-through</b> <b>joint</b> under different loading conditions. The experiments show a good agreement with the thermal modelling results...|$|E
