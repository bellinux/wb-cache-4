40|$|We {{study the}} {{spontaneous}} nucleation {{and growth of}} sodium chloride crystals induced by controlled evaporation in confined geometries (microcapillaries) spanning several orders of magnitude in volume. In all experiments, the nucleation happens reproducibly at a very <b>high</b> <b>supersaturation</b> <b>S</b> ∼ 1. 6 and is independent of the size, shape, and surface properties of the microcapillary. We show from classical nucleation theory that this is expected: S ∼ 1. 6 corresponds {{to the point where}} nucleation first becomes observable on experimental time scales. A consequence of the <b>high</b> <b>supersaturations</b> reached at the onset of nucleation is the very rapid growth of a single skeletal (Hopper) crystal.

40|$|Our work {{investigates the}} {{precipitation}} mechanism of a seeded calcium carbonate reaction, by using cryogenic TEM {{to observe the}} early stages of the reaction. The early precipitation of a hydrated phase is proposed as an intermediate phase before transformation into calcite. Thermodynamic modeling in conjunction with pH, surface potential measurements, and colloidal stability modeling demonstrate that calcite growth is dominated by agglomeration. This is in agreement with the cryogenic TEM observations, which suggest oriented attachment dominates early aggregation. The final stage of the reaction is described by a ripening mechanism that is significantly inhibited when high concentrations of polyacrylic acid (PAA) are used. The different concentrations of PAA lead to significant differences in the final particle substructure observed using cross section TEM. At low PAA concentrations, single crystal particles result, coherent with the proposed early oriented attachment mechanism and interfacial energy calculations. A core shell model is proposed for high PAA concentrations, whereas internal ripening of nanosized pores has been observed for low PAA concentrations, suggesting trapped solvent during the rapid initial particle formation at the relatively <b>high</b> <b>supersaturations</b> (<b>S)</b> 30) investigated. 1...|$|R

An air- borne study, carried out during July 2014 from Resolute Bay, Nunavut, Canada, {{as part of}} the Canadian NETCARE project, provides a comprehensive in situ look into some effects of aerosol particles on liquid clouds in the clean environment of the Arctic summer. Median cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNC) from 62 cloud samples are 10 cm− 3 for low-altitude cloud (clouds topped below 200 m) and 101 cm− 3 for higher-altitude cloud (clouds based above 200 m). The lower activation size of aerosol particles is ≤ 50 nm diameter in about 40 % of the cases. Particles as small as 20 nm activated in the higher-altitude clouds consis- tent with <b>higher</b> <b>supersaturations</b> (<b>S)</b> for those clouds inferred from comparison of the CDNC with cloud condensation nu- cleus (CCN) measurements. Over 60 % of the low-altitude cloud samples fall into the CCN-limited regime of Mauritsen et al. (2011), within which increases in CDNC may increase liquid water and warm the surface. These first observations of that CCN-limited regime indicate a positive association of the liquid water content (LWC) and CDNC, but no associ- ation of either the CDNC or LWC with aerosol variations. Above the Mauritsen limit, where aerosol indirect cooling may result, changes in particles with diameters from 20 to 100 nm exert a relatively strong influence on the CDNC. Within this exceedingly clean environment, as defined by low carbon monoxide and low concentrations of larger parti- cles, the background CDNC are estimated to range between 16 and 160 cm− 3, where higher values are due to activation of particles ≤ 50 nm that likely derive from natural sources.
