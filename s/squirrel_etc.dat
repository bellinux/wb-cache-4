40|$|Viral {{hepatitis}} {{of human}} being {{is caused by the}} various types of hepatitis viruses, such as hepatitis A virus, B virus, δ virus and unknown non-A, non-B hepatitis viruses. Although those viruses belong respectivelly different virus groups, (some one is RNA virus and the other one is DNA virus) the clinical symptoms and histological features of the liver of each viral hepatitis are quite similar. However, there is some difference among liver diseases caused by each virus. Hepatitis A virus and Indian type non-A, non-B virus only cause acute hepatitis by transient infection. On the contrary, hepatitis B virus and other non-A, non-B viruses cause not only acute hepatitis but also various liver diseases, such as chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma due to persistent infection. The incidence of type A hapatitis markedly decreased after World War II in Japan. Whereas, it is still prevalent in South-Asia, Africa and Middle and South-America. Infection of hepatitis A virus is taken place by fecal-oral route. However, there is no evidence for proliferation of this virus in the gut. Hepatitis A virus is only found in the liver, especially in the hepatocytes in the early stage and in the Kupffer cells in the late stage. The spectrum of the clinical and pathological features caused by hepatitis B virus is unusually broad, it also causes chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, healthy carrier and probably hepatocellular carciuoma due to persistent infection. Recently integration of hepatitis B virus genome into cancer cells of the hepatocellular carcinoma was confirmed by Southern blot hybridization method. Furthermore, several quite similar viruses with hepatitis B virus (hepadna viruses) were disclosed in different animal species, such as woodchuck, Pekin duck, grand <b>squirrel</b> <b>etc.</b> and those virues also cause chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma in each animal species. Hepatitis B virus and other hepadna viruses are found mainly in the blood. Therefore, transmission route of those viruses is quite different from hepatitis A virus. Transmission is caused by parenteral routes, such as blood transfusion, intimate contact including sexual intercoures, vertcal transmission at birth. Difference of clinical coures and liver diseases caused by hepatitis B virus mainly depend on the age at which hepatitis B virus infects each persons. Infection in early life, such as newborn or infant usually does not cause acute hepatitis and cause chronic persistent infection. Some of those hepatitis B virus carriers later develop liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Whereas, if immunologically competent adults are infected with hepatitis B virus, they develop acute hepatitis and later do not develop chronic hepatitis or liver cirrhosis. Concerning non-A, non-B hepatitis, causative viruses are not yet disclosed. Chimpanzee have a susceptibility for those viruses. Hepatocyes of the infected chimpanzees show characteristic ultramicroscopical features. Recently we developed monoclonal antibody specific for non-A, non-B hepatitis by mean of EB virus transformation method of B lymphocytes of convalescent chimpanzee. 志方俊夫（日本大学医学部病理学講座・長崎大学熱帯医学研究所防疫部門...|$|E

50|$|Clark's {{nutcracker}}s store seeds, {{usually in}} the ground for later consumption, in caches of 1-15 seeds (average of 3-4 seeds). Depending on the cone crop {{as well as the}} tree species, a single Clark's nutcracker can cache as many as 98,000 seeds per season. The birds regularly store more than they actually need as an insurance against seed theft by other animals (<b>squirrels,</b> <b>etc.),</b> as well as low availability of alternative foods; this surplus seed is left in the cache, and may be able to germinate and grow into new trees, if the conditions are right. Through this activity of caching and over-storing, the bird is perpetuating its own habitat. Closely tied in with this storage behavior is the bird's remarkable long-term spatial memory; they are able to relocate caches of seeds with remarkable accuracy, even nine months later, and even when the cache sites are buried under up to a meter (3 ft) of snow.|$|R

40|$|Introduction. The paper {{presents}} {{one segment}} of the first comprehensive national study investigating information behaviour of Slovenian researchers in all research disciplines in relation to selected demographic variables. Method. An online survey was used, containing content and demographic questions. It {{was based on a}} random sample of the central registry of all active researchers in Slovenia in all scientific disciplines and all age groups. Analysis. Descriptive and bivariate analysis were employed. Results. The most noticeable demographic elements of influence are age and discipline, and in a few cases also sex. In certain areas, the information behaviour of researchers under study conforms with general trends, for example in power-browsing, <b>squirreling,</b> skimming, <b>etc.</b> Information technologies have a strong impact on research work and collaboration. A fairly large segment of researchers often work alonethis is particularly characteristic of researchers in the humanities. Low use of open access documents and weak foreign collaboration in some disciplines are also evidenced. Conclusions. Despite some expected outcomes, certain previously unknown and noteworthy patterns have been identified which are characteristic of Slovenian researchers. This information constitutes a useful foundation for further research in this area...|$|R

5000|$|Rice is {{the staple}} food and wheat, maize, millet are the {{substantial}} cereals, {{which can be}} prepared for consumption in various ways. Large quantities of cooked rice, meat, and vegetables are consumed with various kinds of chutney, ginger, garlic, chilies, and spices. Two heavy meals of almost identical preparation a day is consumed and all else are comestibles of little significance. Since jhum cannot supply all the vegetables and meat, they constantly go to the forest seeking for vegetables, and hunting for deer, fowl, trap small game like <b>squirrels,</b> birds, <b>etc.</b> In preparation, nothing is discarded; chitterlings, such as the brain, hide and innards are all included. The Hmars eat lots of hot chilli (pepper) but with very little spice. Some of the famous dishes are chartang (mixture of meat, vegetable and hot pepper, hmepawk (stew), and changalhme (vegetable or meat cooked with hot pepper and soda made from the ashes)(Pudaite, 1963). Also, the Hmars enjoy sathu (a kind of fermented fats mostly of pork) and prepared in various dishes. The preparation for fermentation is that fat of pork is cut into pieces and cooked well. It is then put into an airtight container (preferably a traditional gourd) for some days until it is fermented. Sathu forms {{one of the main}} traditional seasoning agents for curries. Some other seasoning items like [...] "sithu" [...] (made from fermented sesame seeds), [...] "bekanthu" [...] (made from fermented soyabeans), etc. are also commonly eaten.The diet of the Hmar people is very simple. It is a typical tradition of Hmars to make a kind of porridge prepared by mixing boiled rice with almost any kind of meat (however, mostly pork, chicken, beef, some meats of wild animals) and leaves of [...] "sizo" [...] a wild tree with hard and a slightly bitter tasting leaves. Lye(soda) is added to dissolve the leaves thereby producing yellowish green colour. In most of the community feast, the preparation of such porridge (changal hmepawk) is a regular feature. Chutney made of very hot chillies also is very popular among the Hmars. A typical [...] "Hmehro" [...] prepared {{in such a way that}} any species of vegetables are dried and preserved for eating during off season also is commonly practiced by the Hmars.|$|R
