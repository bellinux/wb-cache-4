5|$|Weather {{maps are}} used to display {{information}} quickly showing the analysis of various meteorological quantities at various levels of the atmosphere, {{in this case the}} surface layer. Maps containing station models aid in the drawing of isotherms, which more readily identifies temperature gradients, and can help in the location of weather fronts. Two-dimensional <b>streamlines</b> based on wind speeds show areas of convergence and divergence in the wind field, which are helpful in determining the location of features within the wind pattern. A popular type of surface weather map is the surface weather analysis, which plots isobars to depict areas of high pressure and low pressure.|$|E
5|$|This {{appeared}} {{to offer a}} solution {{to one of the}} most vexing problems of the era, designing an aircraft that was effective at subsonic and supersonic speeds. Subsonic lift is created by the airflow around the wing following <b>streamlines,</b> but supersonic lift is generated by shock waves at points of critical curvature. No single design could offer high performance for both regimes. The blown disk could attack this problem by being laid out for supersonic performance only, and then using jet thrust to modify subsonic airflow into a semblance of a normal wing. The resulting design would be tuned for high supersonic performance, have reasonable subsonic performance, and would also offer VTOL, all in a single design.|$|E
5|$|A {{weather map}} {{displays}} various meteorological features across {{a particular area}} at a particular point in time and has various symbols which all have specific meanings. Such maps have been in use since the mid-19th century and are used for research and weather forecasting purposes. Maps using isotherms show temperature gradients, which can help locate weather fronts. Isotach maps, analyzing lines of equal wind speed, on a constant pressure surface of 300 or 250hPa show where the jet stream is located. Use of constant pressure charts at the 700 and 500hPa level can indicate tropical cyclone motion. Two-dimensional <b>streamlines</b> based on wind speeds at various levels show areas of convergence and divergence in the wind field, which are helpful in determining the location of features within the wind pattern. A popular type of surface weather map is the surface weather analysis, which plots isobars to depict areas of high pressure and low pressure. Cloud codes are translated into symbols and plotted on these maps along with other meteorological data that are included in synoptic reports sent by professionally trained observers.|$|E
30|$|We {{used the}} peak density {{clustering}} algorithm to classify the <b>streamline</b> field and determined the best <b>streamline</b> cluster number by the S_Dbw coefficient. These methods take full {{account of the}} internal attributes of <b>streamline</b> data, reduce the human factors of qualitative evaluation of reservoir <b>streamline</b> field and determine the direction for remaining oil potential in the high water cut stage. The new <b>streamline</b> field grading method classifies the displacement energy according to the <b>streamline</b> spatial coordinates and the oil and water flow ratio, and clearly indicates the distribution position of the weak drive <b>streamline</b> and the strong drive <b>streamline,</b> making the <b>streamline</b> numerical simulation not only relying on the <b>streamline</b> density to determine the flow intensity qualitatively, but can reach the quantitative evaluation. The Nm 3 - 4 - 1 layer of the Gang Dong oilfield is in the late stage of high water cut development. The distribution of the <b>streamline</b> field is complex. By adjusting the <b>streamline</b> field in time, the flow strength between Lq 7 - 8 and Lq 8 - 8 wells is decreased. The <b>streamline</b> field distribution is more uniform, and the development effect is improved.|$|R
3000|$|In all {{the above}} expressions, X_a is the X-axis {{coordinates}} {{of the middle}} point position of a single <b>streamline.</b> [...] x_i is the x coordinates of a single coordinate point on a <b>streamline.</b> [...] n_a is {{the total number of}} data points on a single <b>streamline.</b> Y_a is the Y-axis coordinates of the middle point position of a single <b>streamline.</b> [...] y_i is the y coordinates of a single coordinate point on a <b>streamline.</b> V_o is the average oil phase velocity of a single <b>streamline.</b> [...] v_oi is the oil phase velocity of a single coordinate point on a <b>streamline.</b> [...] V_w is the average water phase velocity of a single <b>streamline.</b> v_wi is the water phase velocity of a single coordinate point on a <b>streamline.</b>|$|R
5000|$|After {{learning}} how to balance in the water, the next main focus in total immersion is <b>streamlining</b> the body. <b>Streamlining</b> is another element of drag reduction that allows the swimmer to be more efficient. Static <b>streamlining</b> refers to positions such as [...] "skating" [...] in which one arm is extended forward creating a leading point and a tapered body following the arm, much like a torpedo or bullet is shaped. Active <b>streamlining</b> refers to maintaining the <b>streamlined</b> body position while the body rotates from right-side <b>streamline</b> to left-side <b>streamline.</b> Several drills in the method allow the swimmer to practice shifting from <b>streamline</b> to <b>streamline</b> until these movements feel natural. An additional benefit of the <b>streamlined</b> body position is to help maintain a long bodyline in the water, which may help to reduce wave drag and allow the swimmer to slip forward through the water more easily.|$|R
5|$|Isobaric {{analysis}} is performed on these maps, which involves {{the construction of}} lines of equal mean sea level pressure. The innermost closed lines indicate the positions of relative maxima and minima in the pressure field. The minima are called low-pressure areas while the maxima are called high-pressure areas. Highs are often shown as H's whereas lows are shown as L's. Elongated areas of low pressure, or troughs, are sometimes plotted as thick, brown dashed lines down the trough axis. Isobars are commonly used to place surface boundaries from the horse latitudes poleward, while streamline analyses {{are used in the}} tropics. A streamline {{analysis is}} a series of arrows oriented parallel to wind, showing wind motion within a certain geographic area. C's depict cyclonic flow or likely areas of low pressure, while A's depict anticyclonic flow or likely positions of high-pressure areas. An area of confluent <b>streamlines</b> shows the location of shearlines within the tropics and subtropics.|$|E
25|$|If a line, curve {{or closed}} curve {{is used as}} start point for a {{continuous}} set of <b>streamlines,</b> {{the result is a}} stream surface. In the case of a closed curve in a steady flow, fluid that is inside a stream surface must remain forever within that same stream surface, because the <b>streamlines</b> are tangent to the flow velocity. A scalar function whose contour lines define the <b>streamlines</b> is known as the stream function.|$|E

30|$|Comparison of the {{different}} types of <b>streamline</b> attributes in the 14 clusters is shown in Table  2. In the first types of <b>streamline</b> clusters, the average oil saturation, the flow rate of oil phase fluid, and the oil–water flow ratio are much higher than that of the 14 th type of <b>streamline</b> cluster. The above parameters decrease with the increase of <b>streamline</b> classification. The average water saturation and the flow rate of water phase fluid in different <b>streamline</b> clusters increase with the increase of <b>streamline</b> classification. We can accurately determine the optimal number of <b>streamline</b> clusters using the S_Dbw coefficient. Meanwhile, the <b>streamline</b> field evaluation by the peak density clustering algorithm can well reflect the current development status of the reservoir.|$|R
5000|$|The Hudsons were of {{excellent}} quality. Locomotive #5344 (the last J-1e) was built with an Art Deco <b>streamlining</b> designed by Henry Dreyfuss and named Commodore Vanderbilt. [...] It also featured slightly smaller cylinders (to fit within the <b>streamlining?)</b> {{but at a}} higher operating pressure. The <b>streamlining</b> was later replaced to match the last ten J-3a locomotives (5445-5454) that had been built with updated <b>streamlining,</b> also designed by Henry Dreyfuss. Two more J-3a locomotives (5426 & 5429) had a 3rd <b>streamlining</b> style fitted in 1941 for Empire State Express service. The <b>streamlined</b> locomotives featured prominently on NYC advertising.|$|R

30|$|<b>Streamline</b> {{numerical}} simulation {{is widely used}} as an important means to characterize fluid flow paths and describe {{the intensity of the}} flow field during the development of an oil field. By establishing the pressure equation on the grid and quadrature of the <b>streamline,</b> we can get the corresponding pressure equipotential surface and establish a natural migration network. The fluid moves along the <b>streamline,</b> so as to track the migration of oil, gas, and water in the reservoir. Compared with the traditional finite difference {{numerical simulation}} method, modern reservoir <b>streamline</b> simulation in many aspects has achieved great breakthroughs, such as the Pollock <b>streamline</b> tracing method (Jackson et al. 1988), data transfer method between the network and grid (Batycky et al. 1997), and the history matching method based on <b>streamline</b> simulation (Wang 2002). Thiele and Batycky (2003) established water injection optimization model by <b>streamline</b> numerical simulation technology. Cheng et al. (2007) established the historical fitting method of <b>streamline</b> field numerical simulation through three-dimensional three-phase reservoir <b>streamline</b> simulation. Zhao et al. (2016) predicted the connectivity between oil and water wells based on the interwell connectivity inversion model. Wang et al. (2017) characterized the water drive flow field through the water drive characteristic curve and the interwell connectivity model. However, the current <b>streamline</b> field simulation can only qualitatively judge the distribution of the current flow field by the <b>streamline</b> density in each area of the reservoir; it cannot quantitatively evaluate the <b>streamline</b> field. Therefore, we need to explore a method for quantitative evaluation of reservoir <b>streamline</b> field.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{the data}} of the <b>streamline</b> field were extracted, and the <b>streamline</b> field was {{evaluated}} by the peak density clustering algorithm. An evaluation coefficient {{was used to evaluate}} the clustering effect of different <b>streamline</b> cluster numbers, and ultimately we achieved the purpose of <b>streamline</b> grading optimization. The results show that, for the current <b>streamline</b> field of the Nm 3 - 4 - 1 layer in the Gang dong oil field, when the evaluation coefficient we specified is the minimum, the clustering result is the best. The grading results clearly show the distribution of displacing efficiency at the present time of reservoir <b>streamline</b> field. The new method provides a way to regulate the <b>streamline</b> field and enhance oil recovery.|$|R
25|$|This is useful, {{because it}} is usually very {{difficult}} to look at <b>streamlines</b> in an experiment. However, if the flow is steady, one can use streaklines to describe the streamline pattern.|$|E
25|$|<b>Streamlines</b> are {{a family}} of curves that are instantaneously tangent to the {{velocity}} vector of the flow. These show {{the direction in which}} a massless fluid element will travel at any point in time.|$|E
25|$|The {{pipe organ}} {{is another example}} of a {{potentially}} dipole sound source being driven as a monopole source. An air jet is directed at a sharp edge setting up flow oscillations as in the edge tone. The edge is part of a generally cylindrical tube of length L. An example is shown in the figure on the right. The unstable jet drives fluid alternately into the tube and out. The <b>streamlines</b> clearly are distorted from those of the free edge tone. There is a stagnation point opposite the source. The dashed lines, colored in red, are those most strongly modified. The red <b>streamlines</b> in the tube are now augmented by the oscillatory flow in the tube, a superposition of resistive and reactive dipole flow and resistive acoustic flow.|$|E
2500|$|The {{curvature}} of a <b>streamline</b> {{is related to}} the pressure gradient acting perpendicular to the <b>streamline.</b> [...] The center of {{curvature of}} the <b>streamline</b> lies in the direction of decreasing radial pressure. The magnitude of the radial pressure gradient can be calculated directly from the density of the fluid, the curvature of the <b>streamline</b> and the local velocity.|$|R
5000|$|During 1934 {{an extra}} new body shape was offered {{designated}} <b>Streamline</b> saloon and, more compact, a <b>Streamline</b> coupé. Both were a fastback shape, the rear portion {{not unlike the}} [...] body. The four-door <b>Streamline</b> coupé's roof left even less headroom for the rear passengers than the restricted space available to backseat passengers in the <b>Streamline</b> saloon.|$|R
30|$|Reservoir <b>streamline</b> {{numerical}} simulation, as {{an effective}} means to describe the trajectory of reservoir fluid and evaluate the flow size of different regions, has been widely used in various oil fields. To reflect the quantitative description of the <b>streamline</b> field in different development states, taking the different spatial positions and <b>streamline</b> attributes as the evaluation index, the reservoir flow field was clustered and evaluated combined with an artificial intelligence algorithm. The clustering results of different <b>streamline</b> clusters were evaluated using an evaluation coefficient. Finally, a quantitative evaluation method of reservoir <b>streamline</b> field simulation was formed. The {{results show that the}} peak density algorithm based on the evaluation coefficient can run efficiently in the reservoir <b>streamline</b> field and can quickly determine the optimal clustering number. The evaluation method was applied to the Nm 3 - 4 - 1 layer of the Gang Dong oilfield. The current <b>streamline</b> field was divided into 14 grades. The average oil–water mobility ratio of the first kind of <b>streamline</b> cluster was much higher than that of the 14 th kind of <b>streamline</b> cluster. After adjusting the <b>streamline</b> field, the optimal number of clusters was calculated by the evaluation coefficient again, and the number of <b>streamline</b> clusters was changed into seven groups, which indicated that the whole reservoir driving energy was more balanced, and the utilization degree of the reservoir was clearly improved.|$|R
25|$|<b>Streamlines</b> and {{timelines}} {{provide a}} snapshot of some flowfield characteristics, whereas streaklines and pathlines depend on the -history of the flow. However, often sequences of timelines (and streaklines) at different instants—being presented either in a single image or with a video stream—may be used to provide insight in the flow and its history.|$|E
25|$|Importantly, no {{assumption}} is made yet {{on whether the}} right-hand side forces are of either significant or negligible magnitude there. Moreover, trajectories and <b>streamlines</b> coincide in steady-state conditions, and the pairs of adjectives tangential/normal and streamwise/cross-stream become interchangeable. An atmospheric flow in which the tangential acceleration is not negligible is called allisobaric.|$|E

Thus, the repellant pheromone makes the pharaoh ant a particularly efficient forager. Despite their extreme importance, there is an adaptive value to using pheromones sparingly, as it <b>streamlines</b> communication during important decision-making situations, such as a nest migration.|$|E
