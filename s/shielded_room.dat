25|$|A magnetically <b>shielded</b> <b>room</b> (MSR) model {{consists}} of three nested main layers. Each of these layers is made of a pure aluminium layer, plus a high-permeability ferromagnetic layer, similar in composition to molybdenum permalloy.

Magnetic continuity is maintained by overlay strips. Insulating washers {{are used in the}} screw assemblies to ensure that each main layer is electrically isolated. This helps eliminate radio frequency radiation, which would degrade SQUID performance. Electrical continuity of the aluminium is also maintained by aluminium overlay strips to ensure AC eddy current shielding, which is important at frequencies greater than 1Hz. The junctions of the inner layer are often electroplated with silver or gold to improve conductivity of the aluminium layers.|$|E

3000|$|Time-varying fields during {{system-level}} spacecraft function {{tests were}} also {{measured at the}} 2.5 -m distance from the spacecraft center in the same magnetic <b>shielding</b> <b>room.</b> In this case, {{it was difficult to}} evaluate the noise from the spacecraft because the measured field was overwhelmed by noise believed to have originated from controllers located outside the <b>shielding</b> <b>room.</b> The noise appeared even when the spacecraft power was turned off, leading us to conclude that it must have radiated from cables connected to the controllers. For the possible worst-case scenario, in which noise from the spacecraft at the 2.5 -m distance is comparable to the environmental noise, we estimated the noise to be lower than 100 pT/√(Hz), except for a narrow-band enhancement at 7  Hz. If we assume that the noise decreases as the cube of the distance from the spacecraft center, it is estimated to be below 9 pT/√(Hz) at the MGF-S position after MAST deployment, which is comparable to the noise of the MGF instrument itself, as shown in Fig.  5. Moreover, it is one order of magnitude below the required noise level (80 pT/√(Hz)) described in [...] "Requirements for the MGF" [...] section.|$|R

50|$|Working in this area, {{and using}} large magnets, he became {{interested}} in the other extreme; this was the measurement of very weak magnetic fields, which for example might be produced by the weak natural currents in the human body. In 1963, he proposed a method using a magnetically <b>shielded</b> <b>room</b> to keep out external magnetic disturbances, as in radiation shielding in nuclear experiments. At that time others reported the first biomagnetic measurement, where the MCG (magnetocardiogram, the magnetic field due to heart currents) was measured; this was done without shielding, hence showed much external interference. Cohen then built a modest <b>shielded</b> <b>room,</b> and with somewhat clearer signals verified the heart’s magnetic field. He also made the first measurement of the MEG (magnetoencephalogram, the magnetic field of the brain.) However, all these early biomagnetic measurements were generally too noisy, both because of the use of insensitive detectors, and incomplete magnetic shielding.|$|E

For the first time the signals were now clear, and their resulting report, called the magna carta of biomagnetism, ushered in a new era in biomagnetism, attracting other researchers. Cohen then measured the first clear MEG, and signals from other organs. As interest rapidly grew, other laboratories also produced new recordings.

40|$|In vivo {{monitoring}} of low-energy X- and-tray emitters {{has always been}} a difficult task, primarily because of lack of accuracy and the high detection limits of classical techniques. Various types of PIN diodes (diodes with a large intrinsic zone) were tested in the Radiation Protection Department of the Studie Centrum voor Kernenergie, Centre d' 6 tude de l'Energie Nucleaire (Mol, Belgium) in the measurement of radioactive body burden by direct methods. Current research is oriented toward the use of room-temperature diodes for the detection of low-energy photons escaping the body. In this paper, a new counting technique that involves a portable jacket containing the diodes is described. The system uses silicon diodes and is used out of a <b>shielding</b> <b>room</b> in order to be near the contamination. With this method rapid analysis and long counting times are possible, stress is reduced, and medical treatment can be optimized.

50|$|The first MCG {{measurements}} {{were made by}} Baule and McFee using two large coils placed over the chest, connected in opposition to cancel out the relatively large magnetic background. Heart signals were indeed seen, but were very noisy. The next development was by David Cohen, who used a magnetically <b>shielded</b> <b>room</b> to reduce the background, and a smaller coil with better electronics; the heart signals were now less noisy, allowing a magnetic map to be made, verifying the magnetic properties and source of the signal. However, {{the use of an}} inherently noisy coil detector discouraged widespread interest in the MCG. The turning point came with the development of the sensitive detector called the SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) by James Zimmerman.

The sensitivity for various sensor temperatures was measured in the magnetic <b>shielding</b> <b>room</b> at JAXA’s Sagamihara Campus (Hirao et al. 1985). The increase in sensor sensitivity with temperature is caused by thermal expansion of the pickup/feedback coil dimensions.

Nevertheless, in the temperature range from −  20 to 30  °C, the sensitivity variation from that at room temperature was determined within 0.016 %.

50|$|This {{technique}} {{was developed in}} the late-1980s in an attempt to combine the dosimetric advantages of high-dose rate brachytherapy with the challenges of treating some complex anatomic surfaces with IORT. It has the advantage of being lower cost than dedicated electron IORT systems, since many radiation centers already have an HDR system that can be transported to the OR when HDR-IORT is needed. HDR-IORT can also treat very large and convoluted surfaces. However, it does require a shielded OR or a <b>shielded</b> <b>room</b> in the OR complex to deliver the HDR-IORT. The depth of penetration is very limited, typically either ½ cm to 1 cm depth, sometimes requiring extensive surgery due to the limited penetration of the radiation. Treatments tend to be 40 minutes or longer, resulting in greater OR time, more anesthesia and greater blood loss when compared to electron IORT. There are about 10 to 20 active centers using HDR-IORT for locally advanced and recurrent disease, and approximately 2000 patients have received this treatment, mostly for colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer and gynecologic cancer.|$|E

30|$|From unit-level {{measurements}} and examinations {{of the magnetic}} noise prior to the system-level measurement, we determined that battery charging and the magnetic torquer generate time-varying magnetic noise over the required level. During the system-level spacecraft function test in the <b>shielding</b> <b>room,</b> noise from the spacecraft exceeded the environmental noise when the battery was fast-charging and when the magnetic torquer was in operation. Field variation generated by the battery charging current had an amplitude of ~  6  nT at 2.5  m from the spacecraft center, corresponding to an amplitude of ~  0.5  nT {{at the tip of}} the deployed MAST. Variation during torquer operation was about 70 times larger. Therefore, caution is warranted when using data acquired during fast battery charging after an eclipse and at all times when using data acquired during torquer operation, which occurs at perigee in every orbital revolution.|$|R
