25|$|Aspect {{is unusual}} in ASL in that {{transitive}} verbs derived for aspect lose their transitivity. That is, while you can sign 'dog chew bone' for the dog chewed on a bone, or 'she look-at me' for she looked at me, you cannot {{do the same in}} the durative to mean the dog gnawed on the bone or <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> Instead, you must use other strategies, such as a topic construction (see below) to avoid having an object for the verb.|$|E
2500|$|... "Well", she sighed, [...] "you {{see what}} we have been reduced to. We are now in a time when a Szell is {{considered}} a master. How small he was next to Furtwängler." [...] Reeling this disbelief -- not at her verdict, with which I agreed, but from the unvarnished acuteness of it -- I stammered, [...] "But how do you know Furtwängler? You never sang with him." [...] "How do you think?" [...] <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with equal disbelief. [...] "He started his career after the war in Italy [...] I heard dozens of his concerts there. To me, he was Beethoven." ...|$|E
60|$|She turned livid, her step faltered, and she leant {{against the}} frame of the doorway for support. Then <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> wide-eyed in horror.|$|E
6000|$|... "She is as {{like her}} mother as possible," [...] he mused, {{as soon as he}} was clear of the house. [...] "It might have been Hilda herself, only she is twice as {{beautiful}} as Hilda was. I shall have another bad night after this, I know I shall. I must get rid of that girl somehow, I cannot bear her about me; she is a daily reminder of things I dare not remember, and whenever <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with those great eyes of hers, I feel as though she were looking through me. I wonder if she knows the story of Maria Lee!" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{pulled up}} my pony and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> her, feeling very shy {{and not knowing}} what to say. For a while <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> back <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> being afflicted, presumably, with the same complaint, then spoke with an effort, in a voice that was very soft and pleasant.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> {{continued}} to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in her amazement and the confusion that was congenital with it, {{and if there}} was not time for her to withdraw, at least the possibility I had suggested acted as a timely warning.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> till {{her eyes}} grew quite round, then {{puckered}} up {{her mouth as}} though to say something furious, and finally burst out laughing.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in ineffable surprise. [...] "But the Lord Giovanni is {{brave and}} valiant," [...] she cried, {{and down in}} my heart I laughed in bitter mockery.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> too," [...] Edgar said. [...] "I am sure I do {{not know}} her. I don't think I have ever seen her face before." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lady Osprey {{stopped for}} us to {{overtake}} her. [...] "My dear!" [...] she said to Beatrice. [...] "Such a beautiful gallery!" [...] Then <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> very hard <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> puzzled in the most naked fashion to understand who I might be.|$|R
6000|$|... "I couldn't help it," [...] she {{declared}} after church. [...] "What'd <b>she</b> want to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> like that for? Such manners! I'm GLAD stuck my tongue out at her. I wish I'd stuck it farther out. Say, I saw Rob MacAllister from over-harbour there. Wonder if he'll tell Mrs. Wiley on me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In that Black Kloof, Baas, {{some days}} {{after you left}} us and went away. The old baboon man who is called Zikali gave us leave through the witch-girl, Nombe, to go also. So the Baas Anscombe set to work to inspan the horses, the Missie Heda helping him, while I packed the things. When I had nearly {{finished}} Nombe came, smiling like a cat that has caught two mice, and beckoned to me to follow her. I went and saw the cart inspanned with the four horses all looking {{as though they were}} asleep, for their heads hung down. Then after <b>she</b> had <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> for a long while Nombe led me past the horses into the shadow of the overhanging cliff. There I saw my mistress and the Baas Anscombe lying side by side quite dead." ...|$|R
6000|$|A VOICE: Over Ilsenstein; The owl {{was awake}} in the white moonshine; I saw her at rest in her downy nest, And <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with her broad, bright eyne. [...] 165 ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with {{a certain}} attempt at confidence. She is a callous, impertinent kind of girl, and I fear {{inclined}} to be bold. [...] "It do smell, sir," [...] she said to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "'What are you {{stopping}} this locomotive for?' I {{demanded in}} Spanish. Nary an answer. <b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{then at the}} snorting engine and then burst into tears, which you'll admit is uncommon behaviour for an Indian woman.|$|E
60|$|The moment I {{found myself}} out of the {{neighborhood}} of that strange picture, {{it seemed as if}} the charm were broken. All its influence was at an end. I felt assured that it was confined to its own dreary chamber, for I had, with a sort of instinctive caution, turned the key when I closed the door. I soon calmed down, therefore, into a state of tranquillity; from that into a drowsiness, and finally into a deep sleep; out of which I did not awake, until the housemaid, with her besom and her matin song, came to put the room in order. <b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> finding <b>me</b> stretched upon the sofa; but I presume circumstances of the kind were not uncommon after hunting dinners, in her master's bachelor establishment; for she went on with her song and her work, and took no farther heed of me.|$|R
50|$|Angry, <b>she</b> cried 'You <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{with eyes}} like a demon!' (E pupula mai, ou mata o le alelo!). Village chiefs came {{and killed the}} eel. As the fish was dying, it asked Sina to plant its head in the ground. Sina {{followed}} the eel's request, and planted its head in the ground. A coconut tree grew from the ground. When the husk is removed from a coconut, there are three round marks which appear like {{the face of the}} fish with two eyes and a mouth. One of the marks is pierced for drinking the coconut, and hence when Sina takes a drink, she is kissing the eel.|$|R
50|$|Gauguin's {{account is}} {{considerably}} extended {{in the final}} published version. Critics agree that Morice {{was responsible for the}} expansion, albeit with the full support of Gauguin. The description of the painting, previously omitted, now commences:Tehura lay motionless, naked, belly down on the bed: <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> up <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> her eyes wide with fear, and she seemed not to know who I was. For a moment I too felt a strange uncertainty. Tehura's dread was contagious: {{it seemed to me that}} a phosphorescent light poured from her staring eyes. I had never seen her so lovely; above all I had never seen her beauty so moving. And in the half-shadow, which no doubt seethed with dangerous apparitions and ambiguous shapes, I feared to make the slightest move in case the child should be terrified out of her mind. Did I know what she thought I was, in that instant? Perhaps she took me, with my anguished face, for one of those legendary demons or specters, the Tupapaus that filled the sleepless nights of her people.|$|R
6000|$|... "I guessed as {{much when}} I saw {{you talking to}} her. She is a true English lady, heaven bless her! I took the liberty of looking at her painting; and <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> as if I had bitten her." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> for a moment. I can see {{her pretty}} face now as it looked at me--her impenetrable dear face. She laughed a queer little laugh and her color went for a moment, and then so soon as she had spoken, came back again.|$|E
60|$|My pretty, little, startled Dora! Her only {{association}} with the word was a yellow face and a nightcap, or a pair of crutches, or a wooden leg, or a dog with a decanter-stand in his mouth, or something of that kind; and <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with the most delightful wonder.|$|E
60|$|He made no reply--merely let go {{the hand}} that he was holding, removed the other from his shoulder, and turning away descended the steps leading to the garden and {{disappeared}} in the shrubbery. But a moment later I heard, seemingly from a great distance, his fine clear voice in a barbaric chant, which as I listened brought before some inner spiritual sense a consciousness of some far, strange land peopled with beings having forbidden powers. The song held me {{in a kind of}} spell, but when it had died away I recovered and instantly perceived what I thought an opportunity. I walked out of my shadow to where the girl stood. <b>She</b> turned and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with something of the look, it seemed to me, of a hunted hare. Possibly my intrusion had frightened her.|$|R
5000|$|Kay is {{presented}} as a 42-year-old Californian bank teller (and sometimes branch manager) at Van Nuys Savings and Loan. She took a work transfer from the bank she worked at in England to its American branch {{to take advantage of the}} American health care system for her mother. She lives in Panorama City. Unlike her portrayal in The Tracey Ullman Show, Kay doesn't face the wrath of her nasty co-workers. While we still don't see Mother on screen, we hear her through a series of beeps from her bedroom. Kay's mother became an invalid after having been involved in an accident where the sidecar she was traveling in broke free from the motorbike Kay's father was driving. [...] "'I didn't know the damn motorbike would part company with the sidecar, Mildred,' he shouted over his shoulder, as he sped off up Shaftesbury Avenue." [...] Later, Kay's mother warned her: [...] "I remember the cold, steely glint in Mother's eye as <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> up <b>at</b> <b>me</b> from her iron lung. 'Kay,' she said, 'don't ever marry. All men will try to kill you, after they've done nasty things to your downstairs areas.'" [...] It's revealed in the episode [...] "Tracey Takes On... Death" [...] that Kay's father ran off with her aunt, Marjorie.|$|R
40|$|I 2 ̆ 7 ve dashed into {{a coffee}} shop and ordered my {{take-away}} flat white. While waiting I observe {{a group of three}} mothers sitting outdoors with prams carefully arranged not to obstruct the flow of customers, enjoying a coffee and chat with babes in arms. One mum is patiently wrestling with her about 1 -month old baby trying to latch him to breastfeed, while the others watch sympathetically, offering support and advice. 2 ̆ 7 He always fusses like this. Sometimes it takes 5 minutes to get him on and by then he 2 ̆ 7 s lost the plot. Being somewhere different seems to make him worse 2 ̆ 7. 2 ̆ 7 Have you had him checked for tongue-tie? 2 ̆ 7 one mother asks knowingly. I listen in, deliberately eavesdropping now. 2 ̆ 7 Yes, the Child Health Nurse had a look but said his mouth is quite normal and the fussing is just his impatience to get the food 2 ̆ 7. She popped a dummy in the baby 2 ̆ 7 s mouth and he calmed down temporarily. My coffee is ready and I sit down for a few sips. 2 ̆ 7 My friend 2 ̆ 7 s baby needed a release for a tongue-tie which many health professionals missed but the chiropractor found. Maybe you should take him to a chiropractor? 2 ̆ 7 The baby squawks spitting out the dummy, and the mother firmly lays his flailing arms across his chest trying valiantly to latch him again. At this point I cannot resist getting involved too, my heart is pounding as I introduce myself as an international board certified lactation consultant (IBCLC) 2 ̆ 7 Gosh you 2 ̆ 7 re having a battle there. can I offer a suggestion? 2 ̆ 7 All three pairs of eyes look astonished at my bold intervention, but she gladly agrees 2 ̆ 7 Yes, whatever can help 2 ̆ 7. I verbally guide her to position her baby differently - his hip towards her hip, arms either side of her breast, his chest snuggling in contact with her own and holding him only over his shoulders allowing his head to fall back. She resists allowing his head to be free but complies as his chin rests at the base of her areola. Baby gapes widely and spontaneously latches as my hand supports her hand on his shoulders to maintain a secure hold. The expression on her face tells me she is greatly relieved. 2 ̆ 7 It doesn 2 ̆ 7 t hurt, 2 ̆ 7 she says with a look of disbelief as <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> smiling. 2 ̆ 7 Great, remember what you and your baby have just done. Keep going. You are doing a fantastic job! 2 ̆ 7...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{like one}} dazzled. [...] "Good God!" [...] she said once, {{in a kind}} of {{bursting}} exclamation; and then a second time in a whisper to herself: [...] "Great God!--In the name of mercy, Mackellar, what is wrong?" [...] she cried. [...] "I am made up; I can hear all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What letters?" [...] <b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and added, looking away, [...] "Oh, mine?" [...] She {{gave out}} the word with a long, inexhaustible sigh. [...] "That was all right. He did not hide, he burned.... Neither to nor from; not even to his mother. Every paper destroyed. I envy her feelings! He just gave up, went out, Exit. I envy that, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> for {{a second}} longer with eyes growing wider and {{brighter}} and a smile that had become fixed, glanced again at the bright little shop still saying [...] "Ponderevo" [...] with all the emphasis of its fascia, and then flopped back hastily {{out of sight of}} me into the recesses of the cab. Then it had gone from before me and I beheld Mr. Snape, the hairdresser, inside his store regarding its departure with a quiet satisfaction and exchanging smiles and significant headshakes with Mr. Marbel.|$|E
40|$|Approaches {{to family}} therapy and {{counseling}} are influenced {{not only by}} client needs and presenting complaints {{but also by the}} clini-cian’s theoretical orientation and personal experiences. This article explores the reciprocal influence that takes place between family therapists, their families of origin, and the families they treat. The relative influence of these dimensions are explored from a systems theoretical perspective. First there is a startling thump, then a scream, and finallyan ominous silence. I (Jeffrey) look at the client sitting in my office, and <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> back <b>at</b> <b>me</b> forcefully as if to say, “Hey, this is your office. You go check out what happened. ” Not wanting to appear timid and indecisive in front of this new client, I {{take a deep breath and}} slowly make my way to the waiting room where I see an elderly couple, newly referred by a physician, in mortal combat. They are actually wrestling on my couch! The woman then stands over the frail-looking gentleman, clearly of superior physical strength, and proceeds to wag her finger in his face as she taunts him. He ineffectually tries to defend himself, finally hurling some accusation at her that long ago had been tested under similar conditions. His attack strikes its mark, for this dignified-looking, proper woman cries out in anguish and then proceeds to wail at him with her fist. On seeing me, the man and woman calmly composed themselves, rearranged their own (and each others’!) clothing, and then politely intro-duced themselves as the new couple I would be working with. This couple and I were to spend many hours together dur-ing the coming months. Never could I have imagined the mutual effects we would have on one another. Naturally, I fully expected to affect them in a significant way by helping them stop their cycle of physical violence, but little did I real-ize the extent to which they would trigger my own fam-ily-of-origin issues or influence my own family relationships in the present. I had no idea that the abuse/violence I had wit-nessed in my personal life would help me with this couple as much as anything I had learned in graduate school...|$|R

60|$|I {{found the}} Mews easily. A crook-backed dwarf {{of a man}} was {{lounging}} {{at the corner of}} it smoking his pipe. Not liking his looks, I did not inquire of him where Mrs. Horlick lived, but went down the Mews till I met with a woman, and asked her. She directed me to the right number. I knocked at the door, and Mrs. Horlick herself--a lean, ill-tempered, miserable-looking woman--answered it. I told her at once that I had come to ask what her terms were for charing. <b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> for a moment, then answered my question civilly enough.|$|E

[...] "No doubt the seafaring men want 'baccy at all hours. She was much amazed at our request, and called her mother, who came out in remarkable dishabille, and is plainly foreign. I can't think where I have seen such a pair of eyes-—most likely in the head of some chorus-singer, indeed the voice had something of the quality.

So she knows, Pan, and I rather think she didn't want us to see her when she meets you. You'll find her in the orchard or down by the brook." ...|$|E
