60|$|CANDIDA. Yes, dear: I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> But never mind: I shan't misunderstand.|$|E
6000|$|Ant. Why, <b>sure,</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not put {{yourself}} {{and me to}} all this trouble for a dry come-off; by this hand-- [...] [Taking it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> Poor old man! If you {{had done}} what he asked you I wonder whether his affection would have lasted as it has done." ...|$|E
60|$|Lau. [To AUR.] If {{my uncle}} know us, we are ruined; {{therefore}} be <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not speak.|$|R
60|$|But be <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> die nevertheless. Do your work, {{and finish}} it. If {{you know how}} to begin, you will know when to end.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no! You mustn't say that. If {{you wish}} to be kind to me--and I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> wish it--don't think bitterly of Philip." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mr Nickleby,' said brother Charles, 'you did {{not violate}} the {{confidence}} I placed in you, or take an unworthy advantage of it. I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And is that Lord Fitzjocelyn's {{definition}} of a narrow mind?' said Isabel. 'It sounds like faith and love. Are you <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not make it yourself, Miss Ponsonby?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be sad, Dodo; kiss baby. What are you {{brooding}} over so? I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> everything, and a {{great deal}} too much. You should be happy now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Papa, <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> <b>You</b> must know, <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{know all}} the things they said at Plumstead. I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> <b>You</b> {{know all the}} archdeacon said. How unjust he was; and Mr. Arabin too. He's a horrid man, a horrid odious man, but--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Selfish!' cried Tom. 'You {{have acted}} nobly. To love her as I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> {{and yet in}} {{consideration}} for her state of dependence, not even to disclose--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> me no {{more than}} justice,’ said I; ‘and I shall think it quite {{unnecessary}} to dwell {{on any of these}} passing circumstances in my report to the Vicomte.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, bravo!" [...] cried I. [...] "I laid a trap for you there, Mr. Denman. Now I {{need not}} ask you; I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not tell this prying stranger." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It shall all be made {{right in}} the morning," [...] said his wife. [...] "But are you <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not take {{anything}} that disagreed with you while you were away?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To be <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> What {{should a}} young fellow {{like you do}} ashore for half a year together? If a man had not a wife, he soon wants to be afloat again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> nothing <b>you</b> oughtn't." [...] Mr. Longdon {{kept the}} {{photograph}} {{and continued to}} look at it. [...] "Her mother told me about her--promised me I should see her next time." ...|$|R
6000|$|O'Con. Then, upon my word, I'll {{have the}} Rising Sun put down, and the Angel shall give {{security}} for his good behaviour; but are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> nothing to quit scores with them? ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Do not {{dwell in}} the two biased views. Make <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not pursue. The moment you think about right and wrong, that moment you unwittingly lose your true mind." [...] (二見不住 慎勿追尋 才有是非 紛然失心) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> When {{you said}} 'Sion hill' I {{recollect}} I {{thought of the}} Methodists directly. I couldn't have thought of the Methodists, if you hadn't said 'Sion hill.' It stands to reason." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am quite}} <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> {{but it is}} no good our following; the side roads are so cut up by ruts that we should break a spring before we had gone a hundred yards. No, we will stop and look at this fellow who is unhorsed, Mark." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can easily}} believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> The turn of your countenance I shall never forget, {{as you said}} that I could not have {{addressed}} you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Be <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> Massa Vincent. <b>You</b> ride about a great deal, dat fellow bery like {{take a shot}} at {{you from}} behind tree. Don't you go near dat plantation, or sure enuff trouble come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> me no {{more than}} justice," [...] said I; [...] "and I shall think it quite {{unnecessary}} to dwell {{on any of these}} passing circumstances in my report to the Vicomte." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{not wish}} to drive me away from Brampton," [...] she continued, in the same low voice, [...] "when I have found a place to earn my living near-near Uncle Jethro." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you don't}} {{tell me what}} there is in it, I don't see what we are to do. I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not give {{yourself}} the trouble of coming up here from Hamworth merely with the object of telling us {{that you are going}} to hold your tongue." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> And {{now what}} have you got to say?" [...] Here there was another shrug of the shoulders. [...] "I suppose you think because you are a rich man that you may do {{whatever}} you please. But you'll have to learn the difference. You must be exposed, Sir." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Really, mother, the way {{the best}} of women speak of each other is lamentable. You say I should be better married, and then you take for granted that every marriageable woman in the {{neighbourhood}} is trying to kidnap me. I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not take my father by force in that way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not, Madame Goesler. Nor do I {{think that}} anybody does. It is too absurd for belief from {{beginning}} to end. Good-bye. Perhaps I shall see you when the debate is over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'm {{not quite}} so <b>sure.</b> <b>You</b> <b>do</b> go as {{straightforward}} as most on 'em; but I ain't quite sure but {{that there are a}} few twists and twirls. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> suppose he wants to be at?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are <b>you</b> quite <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it willingly?" [...] queried his tormentor, adding, [...] "another little half-turn, please, Simon; and you, Mistress Meg, if {{he begins}} to faint, just prick him in the thigh with your knife." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you just}} now told {{the gentleman who}} {{examined}} you on the other side, that you were quite <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not witness two deeds {{on the day he}} named,--the 14th of July. Now, seeing that you doubt your own memory, going back over so long a time, do you wish to correct that statement?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I told 'em I was <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did!</b> I'd love to come, {{but they}} wouldn't let me, I know. I'm so {{sorry about the}} fight. Couldn't you make it up, and be {{pleasant}} again?" [...] asked Rosy, clasping her hands with a beseeching gesture as her bright face grew sad and serious remembering the feud.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> dear," [...] said Mrs Oakes. Which {{shows how}} {{differently}} {{the same thing}} may strike different people. Barry certainly did not {{look as if he}} had been cheered up when Clowes left the study and went over to tell Trevor that he would have to find a substitute for his right wing three-quarter against Ripton.|$|E
6000|$|When {{they had}} gone some {{distance}} on the road home, the girl turned {{to her husband and}} said: 'Till you step inside the house, be <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not look back, whatever you may hear or see.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of course I {{have been}} very cruelly circumstanced. Everybody must see that. I'm <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> mamma. The long and short of it is this;--if I give up my engagement, will he take us abroad for a year?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{told you}} what I should like to <b>do</b> for <b>you.</b> See that the {{conditions}} come about promptly in which I may, <b>do</b> it. Are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> everything to satisfy Mrs. Dallow?" [...] Mr. Carteret continued.|$|R
