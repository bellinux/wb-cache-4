Somalia has the highest global prevalence (98 %) of female circumcision (FC), and, despite {{a long history of}} abandonment efforts, it is not clear {{as to whether or not}} these programmes have changed people’s positive attitudes toward the practice. Against this background, this paper explores the attitudes of Somalis living in Hargeisa and Galkayo districts to the practice of FC. Methods. A purposive sampling of 24 Somalis, including activists and practitioners, men and women, was conducted in Somalia. Unstructured interviews were employed to explore the participants ’ knowledge of FC, their attitudes toward the continuation/discontinuation of the practice, and the type they want to continue or not to continue. Result. The findings of this qualitative study indicate that there is a strong resistance towards the abandonment of the practice in Somalia.

A purposive sampling of 24 Somalis, including activists and practitioners, men and women, was conducted in Somalia. Unstructured interviews were employed to explore the participants' knowledge of FC, their attitudes toward the continuation/discontinuation of the practice, and the type they want to continue or not to continue. Result. The findings of this qualitative study indicate that there is a strong resistance towards the abandonment of the practice in Somalia. The support for the continuation of <b>Sunna</b> <b>circumcision</b> is widespread, while there is a quite large rejection of Pharaonic circumcision. Conclusion. Therefore, since the “zero tolerance policy” has failed to change people’s support for the continuation of the practice in Somalia, programmes that promote the pinch of the clitoral skin and verbal alteration of status, with the goal of leading to total abandonment of FC, should be considered for the Somali context...|$|E
40|$|Background: Female {{circumcision}} is {{a practice}} which {{has existed for}} thousands of years and is carried out across Africa from the north eastern coast to the west coast. On the Horn of Africa nearly all Somali women are circumcised, most of which are infibulated. Aim: The aim of the study has been to reveal current views, public and political opinions and to explore how and by whom the discourse on female circumcision was expressed {{at the time of the}} study, in Hargeysa, Somaliland. Method: Numeral informal conversations were held with health workers and students in a hospital. In depth interviews with 3 women involved in the work to abandon female circumcision, and interviews drawing on principles of life story interviews were held with 5 returned exile women. Field notes were continuously written throughout the time spend in Hargeysa. The discourse that emerged from the material was analyzed using the principles of Foucault. Results: Analysis of the discourse on female circumcision revealed a discourse of a changing practice despite indications of a continuation of the practice, although in a changed form. Whether this change applies to the actual practice lies beyond the premises of the study. Conclusion: Abandoners' of female circumcision rely on political, ideological and economic support from outside, including the Somali diaspora for the eradication effort. Health workers supported by health research and the community of religious leaders reveal reasons for abandonment of infibulation, while the same reasons do not strongly enough emphasize the necessity to end <b>sunna</b> <b>circumcision.</b> Practitioners' of female circumcision still perceive circumcision of girls as necessary to become good' and pure' women. Confusing, contrasting and religiously connected terms for the practice may partly be the reason for a delayed process to end an unfortunate human practice...|$|E
