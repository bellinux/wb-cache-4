The 15 related authorization provisions were completed by the Financial Supervisory Commission on May 3, 2015. Minister Tsai also promoted an amendment of the Company Act to include a new dedicated section on [...] "closed companies". The amendment passed the third reading at the Legislative Yuan on June 15, 2015 and promulgated in September __, 2015. The new language included covers the multiple voting rights of special <b>shares,</b> <b>shares</b> <b>without</b> <b>par</b> <b>value</b> and other new rules to provide greater flexibility to start-ups in determining their shareholding structure. Third, Entrepreneur Visas - the Executive Yuan established the Innovation and Startups Taskforce, which is further split into four separate groups for promoting the plan to transform Taiwan into the Silicon Valley of Asia and where young entrepreneurs may realize their dreams. Among the four groups, the [...] "Start-up Environment Group" [...] is focused on bringing entrepreneurial talent, learning from other countries' experiences and establish the [...] "Entrepreneur Visa" [...] program to incentivize foreign entrepreneurs to come to Taiwan for start-ups, thereby synergizing global creativity with Taiwan's own resources to energize entrepreneurial activities in Taiwan and stimulate economic growth.|$|R

5000|$|The book {{is divided}} into five parts. The first covers general and well known {{characteristics}} of corporations in contradistinction {{to other forms of}} enterprise the second describes the media through which the corporation may secure capital; and the third the practical problems of securing it. Of these three parts the concluding chapter of the second (ch. 8) entitled Basis of Capitalization is the most constructive and worthwhile. Especially important in the haze of present-day attempts to establish a sound basis for public regulation of corporate income is Lough's insistence that earning power, not original investment, is the most rational basis of capitalization. In accordance with this theory one would wish that he had devoted more than a paragraph to the important recent changes in New York and other state laws permitting the issue of stock <b>without</b> <b>par</b> <b>value.</b>|$|R

This paper traces the history of the debate in the United Kingdom, from attempts by guarantee companies last century to issue <b>shares</b> <b>without</b> any value attached, up to a 1973 White Paper. It shows that failure to introduce no <b>par</b> <b>value</b> shares can be explained variously by ignorance, misunderstanding and political cowardice and highlights {{the way in which the}} issue became a significant factor in industrial relations during the 1950 s.

5000|$|Because <b>par</b> <b>value</b> {{was such}} an {{unreliable}} indicator of the actual value of stock, and because high <b>par</b> <b>values</b> could create liability for investors if the corporation went into bankruptcy, corporate lawyers began advising their clients to issue stocks with low <b>par</b> <b>values.</b> The legal capital or [...] "stated capital" [...] of the corporation would still be determined based on <b>par</b> <b>value,</b> but the balance sheet would include the investment over <b>par</b> <b>value</b> as a capital surplus, and everything would still balance.|$|R
50|$|Many common stocks issued {{today do}} not have par values; those that do (usually only in jurisdictions where <b>par</b> <b>values</b> are {{required}} by law) have extremely low <b>par</b> <b>values</b> (often the smallest unit of currency in circulation), for example a penny <b>par</b> <b>value</b> on a stock issued at USD$25/share.

50|$|The <b>par</b> <b>value</b> {{of stock}} has no {{relation}} to market value and, as a concept, is somewhat archaic. The <b>par</b> <b>value</b> of a share is the value stated in the corporate charter below which shares of that class cannot be sold upon initial offering; the issuing company promises not to issue further shares below <b>par</b> <b>value,</b> so investors can be confident {{that no one else}} will receive a more favorable issue price. Thus, <b>par</b> <b>value</b> is the nominal value of a security which is determined by the issuing company to be its minimum price. This was far more important in unregulated equity markets than in the regulated markets that exist today, where a stock issuance prices must usually be published. The <b>par</b> <b>value</b> of stock remains unchanged in a bonus stock issue but it changes in a stock split.|$|R

40|$|The FASB has converged SFAS 123 R with IFRS No. 2, which {{simultaneously}} defines {{that the}} value of stock compensation is an expense under fair value method that must be recognized in the current statement of operations. However, under the fair value method, volatility of the market value of stock is easily subjected to the business cycle, political condition, managerial behavior, and macroeconomic factors, which results in a poor explanatory index than <b>par</b> <b>value</b> method. This paper limits the research target to stock option and restricted stock as incentive vehicles only, and investigates separately influence of stock compensation on firm's financial performance under <b>par</b> <b>value</b> and fair value. According to the empirical results, growth, firm size, and fixed asset turnover are all significant and positively correlated with EPS; debt ratio is significant and negatively correlated with EPS. Stock compensation presented in <b>par</b> <b>value</b> is significant in t value and increases EPS by 0. 68 % while stock compensation presented in fair value is not. Stock compensation presented in <b>par</b> <b>value</b> of 60. 5 % R-square seems that there’s no better explanation on the firm’s financial performance than that in fair value of 60. 2 %.
