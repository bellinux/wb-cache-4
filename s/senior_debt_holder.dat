40|$|Abstract. In the {{aftermath}} of the crisis, valuations of fixed income derivatives have significantly diverged from the principles of arbitrage-free pricing. Discrepancies arise because of the incompleteness of collateral trading markets which lack of reverse REPO contracts for cash upgrades accepting OTC derivatives as general collateral. This circumstance forces banks to implement sub-optimal super-replication strategies generating wealth transfers across the bank capital structure from shareholders to <b>senior</b> <b>debt</b> <b>holders.</b> The present value of the wealth transfer is the FVA. To avoid losses to shareholders, the bank cannot realistically carry out a Modigliani-Miller arbitrage which would involve buying back all its debt liabilities using equity capital or shorting its own credit. Transferring FVA costs to clients is a suboptimal solution which engenders systemic arbitrage opportunities and drives the financial system away from Pareto optimality. In this paper, we argue that one can arrive to economic equilibrium not with one but with two universal agents whereby market risk and credit risk are managed by two separate legal entities. In this context, we discuss market-completing collateral trading strategies which solve the problem at the root. They reduce or eliminate the FVA and DVA. They also exploit the form of bank capital structure arbitrage revealed in current derivative valuations. Similar strategies also mitigate counterparty credit risk for banks and reduce or eliminate CVA capital charges. 1...|$|R

40|$|During the {{financial}} and sovereign crisis, governments protected {{the financial}} system from a collapse. The transfer of impaired assets to a bad bank, or a guarantee on these assets, {{is one of the}} state aid measures applied by governments to preserve financial stability. The transfer price or guaranteed value is crucial in the assessment of state aid. The real challenge is thus to determine the state-aid-compatible value of impaired assets, which is called the Real Economic Value (REV). The REV of a portfolio of impaired assets is based on a valuation methodology that was established by the European Commission. This methodology uses, inter alia, a suitable credit risk premia. It is therefore important to compare the risk premia actually applied in the REV method to the long-term average risk premia. For that reason, we examine the relative credit risk premium, also called coverage ratio, which is the ratio between the actual and risk-neutral default probability. The latter is the default probability derived from market quotes. The coverage ratio captures the magnitude of distress and perceived risk in credit markets. We consider coverage ratios for different time periods and quantify its long-term average value. Special attention is given to {{the financial and}} sovereign crisis and their impact on credit risk premia. We compute the actual default probabilities from yearly transition matrices, while the risk-neutral default probabilities are estimated from credit default swaps. We find that the long-term coverage ratios increased by 30 to 80 %. Our results show that coverage ratios have increased since 2008 and that its post-crisis levels (after 2012) are still higher compared to pre-crisis values. If one interprets this increase as a permanent shift in risk premia, it will impact corporates' funding costs. To study the differences between industries in terms of credit risk premia, we change the estimates for the actual default probability and use Moody's Expected Default Frequencies (EDF). For the banking sector, we observe an underestimation of the credit risk before the financial crisis and even after the sovereign crisis this underestimation persists, although to a lesser extent. This observation raises doubts about the applied recovery rate assumption of 40 % for <b>senior</b> <b>debt.</b> We examine therefore if the risk-neutral recovery rates for the banking sector are different from this standard value. To this end, we apply and extend the model of Schläfer and Uhrig-Homburg (2014). The model assumes absolute priority rule, which reinforces that senior creditors are paid back in full before the subordinated <b>debt</b> <b>holders</b> can recover their investment. Historical data shows that for the banking sector the absolute priority rule is not always respected and thus <b>senior</b> <b>debt</b> <b>holders</b> transfer a certain amount of the value, to which they are entitled, to the subordinated <b>debt</b> <b>holders.</b> We include absolute priority rule violation in the model and adjust it to the bank specific liability structure. We find empirical evidence that credit markets assume absolute priority rule violation and that the standard assumption of a risk-neutral recovery rate of 40 % is not valid for <b>senior</b> <b>debt</b> of European banks in the considered time period. Our estimates are higher than these standard assumptions. In the case of absolute priority rule violation, the average recovery rate implied by the market for <b>senior</b> and subordinated <b>debt</b> are respectively 82 % and 73 %. Comparing the average implied recovery rates with their historical counterparts indicates that the recovery risk premium is underestimated for <b>senior</b> <b>debt</b> and subordinated debt. The magnitude of the underestimation of the recovery risk premium on <b>senior</b> <b>debt</b> is smaller than the one on subordinated debt. In the last part of this dissertation, we study banks' coverage ratios by incorporating implied recovery rates in the calculations of credit risk premia. Before the financial crisis (2006 and 2007), we still observe that the credit risk of European banks was underestimated. The credit risk premia increased during the financial and sovereign crisis and reduced again {{in the last years of}} our observation period (2006 - 2014). From the start of the financial crisis, we do not find evidence for the underestimation of banks' credit risk premia, which indicates a permanent shift in banks' coverage ratios. This observation points to higher financing costs on banks' debt compared to pre-crisis levels. Our results imply that corporates will face, ceteris paribus, higher credit risk premia and thus higher financing costs on their debt. For banks, this finding is even more pronounced. With the new resolution regulation for banks, due to the enforcement of the strict application of the absolute priority rule, the implied recovery rates of subordinated debt will decrease. Given that the default probability stays the same, banks' subordinated debt will become more expensive. Our insights are valuable for state aid assessments, for pricing default-prone financial instruments and for risk management practices that estimate risk-neutral default and recovery rates. nrpages: 170 status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|Mezzanine {{capital is}} often a more {{expensive}} financing source for a company than secured <b>debt</b> or <b>senior</b> <b>debt.</b> The higher cost of capital associated with mezzanine financings {{is the result of}} its being an unsecured, subordinated (or junior) obligation in a company's capital structure (i.e., in the event of default, the mezzanine financing is only repaid after all senior obligations have been satisfied). Additionally, mezzanine financings, which are usually private placements, are often used by smaller companies and may involve greater overall levels of leverage than issues in the high-yield market; they thus involve additional risk. In compensation for the increased risk, mezzanine <b>debt</b> <b>holders</b> require a higher return for their investment than secured or more senior lenders.|$|R

50|$|Many small {{companies}} rely on selling convertible debt to large private investors (see private investment in public equity) to fund their operations and growth. This convertible debt, often convertible preferred stock or convertible debentures, {{can be converted}} to the common stock of the issuing company often at steep discounts to the market value of the common stock. Under the typical “death spiral” scenario, the holder of the convertible debt initially shorts the issuer’s common stock, which often causes the stock price to decline, at which time the <b>debt</b> <b>holder</b> converts some of the convertible debt to common shares with which he then covers the <b>debt</b> <b>holder's</b> short position. The <b>debt</b> <b>holder</b> continues to sell short and cover with converted stock, which, along with selling by other shareholders alarmed by the falling price, continually weakens the share price, making the shares unattractive to new investors and possibly severely limiting the company’s ability to obtain new financing if necessary.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to address issues in the area of default pricing. Past research document inadequacies in estimating the premium received by <b>debt</b> <b>holders.</b> One of the foremost reasons is that the idiosyncratic risks borne by <b>debt</b> <b>holders</b> are not well approximated, and this stems from a lack of understanding of default probabilities. Acknowledging the problem, this study adopts an exploratory approach in developing an alternative approach that seeks to explain the price behavior of corporate bonds. This approach simply improvises two areas of finance: event studies and options pricing. An amalgamation of both areas introduces a stochastic element in the prediction of corporate bond prices; and by means of empirical tests, the resulting estimates of this approach appear to be suitable for default pricing. Another contribution resulting from the exposits of our approach is to deduce that <b>debt</b> <b>holders</b> do not respond homogenously to default risk. Instead, they respond in two manners that are bounded by the undertakings of the firm. In the first manner, <b>debt</b> <b>holders</b> exhibit a symmetric response to information about the undertakings of the firm, such that they resemble equity holders. The second manner portrays asymmetric responses. Evidence to these contrasting observations is independently documented in past literature, but somehow it has never been synthesized. Thus, this study attempts to point out the differences and demonstrate how it can impinge default pricing...|$|R
