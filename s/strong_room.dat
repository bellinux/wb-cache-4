5|$|The {{court was}} told of three other cases. Captain John Bromfield, Robert Newton and James Thompson all died after similar {{treatment}} from Acton: a beating, followed by {{time in the}} hole or <b>strong</b> <b>room,</b> before being moved to the sick ward, where they were left to {{lie on the floor}} in leg irons.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower was}} {{constructed}} sometime between the Dissolution and the Union of the Crowns but the exact date is not known. It was probably constructed as a <b>strong</b> <b>room</b> to store munitions or provide a secure location {{if the city}} walls were breached. This turned the ground floor room into a lock up where troublesome citizens would be thrown until they came before the law to be punished. Much about the tower has changed. The wall {{to the right of}} the door is 13th-century, while the dividing wall including the door is 18th-century.|$|E
5|$|Bliss {{was left}} in the <b>strong</b> <b>room</b> for three weeks wearing a {{skullcap}} (a heavy vice for the head), thumb screws, iron collar, leg irons, and irons round his ankles called sheers. One witness said the swelling in his legs was so bad that the irons on one side could no longer be seen for overflowing flesh. His wife, who was able to see him through a small hole in the door, testified that he was bleeding from the mouth and thumbs. He was given a small amount of food but the skullcap prevented him from chewing; he had to ask another prisoner, Susannah Dodd, to chew his meat for him. He was eventually released from the prison, but his health deteriorated and he died in St. Thomas's Hospital.|$|E
50|$|John Chubb (10 December 1816 - 30 October 1872), was an English {{locksmith}} and inventor who patented many {{improvements to}} locks, safes and <b>strong</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|R
50|$|Permission {{was given}} to the justices to acquire land and buildings, and borrow money for the {{construction}} of police stations and to build <b>strong</b> <b>rooms</b> for the temporary confinement of prisoners.|$|R
60|$|Betsy-Jane said Fanny {{had gone}} into No. 3 staircase, on which Mrs. Bolton said she was {{probably}} in <b>Strong's</b> <b>rooms,</b> and bade the child go and {{see if she was}} there.|$|R
5|$|The {{first case}} against Acton, before Mr. Baron Carter, {{was for the}} murder in 1726 of Thomas Bliss, a {{carpenter}} and debtor. Unable to pay the prison fees, Bliss had been left with so little to eat that {{he had tried to}} escape by throwing a rope over the wall, but his pursuers severed it and he fell 20feet into the prison yard. Wanting to know who had supplied the rope, Acton beat him with a bull's pizzle, stamped on his stomach, placed him in the hole (a damp space under the stairs), then in the <b>strong</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some {{combination}} of porous absorption with these complementary methods is typically preferred for their simplicity, affordability, and convenience, but resonant bass traps {{are more effective}} for absorbing <b>strong</b> <b>room</b> resonances where the aforementioned complimentary methods are inadequate or impractical, particularly when the geometry of the room causes problematic narrow-band resonances that affect the low bass and {{the composition of the}} room boundaries is highly reflective rather than acoustically lossy.|$|E
25|$|Atratos {{maiden voyage}} began from Southampton on 17 January 1889. As {{well as her}} passengers, mails and a full cargo she carried in her <b>strong</b> <b>room</b> £120,000 in sovereigns, {{jewellery}} worth £2,000 and silver bars worth £400. She called at Carril, Vigo and Lisbon, and then crossed the Atlantic to South America. There she worked {{her way down the}} east coast, calling at Pernambuco, Maceió, Bahia, Rio de Janeiro, Santos, Montevideo and Buenos Aires. Magdalena, Thames and Clyde joined the same South American route over the next 18 months, but after her maiden voyage Atrato was switched to join Orinoco on RMSP's Caribbean route. All five sisters had long and successful careers.|$|E
50|$|Apart from {{produce and}} merchandise, these river craft also carried cash. Where banks did not exist, John Holt had <b>strong</b> <b>rooms.</b> Even after banks were established, many Nigerians {{preferred}} to deposit their cash with John Holt.|$|R
50|$|Designed {{to stand}} {{prominently}} in the commercial district of a booming gold mining town and retaining major design elements, including discreet office suites, boardroom, <b>strong</b> <b>rooms,</b> stables and earth closets, Smithfield Chambers is important in illustrating the layout and operation of a mining secretaries' building.|$|R
50|$|All {{the office}} floors, {{from the first}} floor to the top floor, are similar. An open plan with large columns is divided by modern office {{partitioning}} and suspended ceilings conceal the original ceilings. Heavily reinforced concrete <b>strong</b> <b>rooms</b> and safes {{are located in the}} basement with smaller <b>strong</b> <b>rooms</b> on each floor. The lightwell, on the southeast side of the building, contains steel fire escape stairs and steel and concrete walkways. A brick and concrete extension accessed from the walkway has been built into the lightwell and the large windows to the banking chamber and offices have been bricked in. Former photographic rooms, the staircase lantern, toilets, stores, elevator and plant enclosures, are located on the flat roof of the building.|$|R
500|$|Originally {{built to}} hold pirates, the <b>strong</b> <b>room</b> {{was just a}} few yards from the prison's sewer. It was never cleaned, had no drain, no sunlight, no fresh air—the smell was {{described}} as [...] "noisome"—and was full of rats and sometimes [...] "several barrow fulls of dung". Several prisoners told the court that it contained no bed, so that prisoners had to lie on the damp floor, possibly next to corpses awaiting burial. But a group of favoured prisoners Acton had paid to police the jail told the hearing there was indeed a bed. One of them said he often chose to lie in there himself, because the <b>strong</b> <b>room</b> was so clean; the [...] "best room on the Common side of the jail", said another. This despite the court's having heard that one prisoner's left side had mortified from lying on the wet floor, and that a rat had eaten the nose, ear, cheek and left eye of another.|$|E
500|$|What often {{finished}} {{them off}} was {{being forced to}} lie in the <b>strong</b> <b>room,</b> a windowless shed near the main sewer, next to piles of night soil and cadavers awaiting burial. Dickens described it as [...] "dreaded by even the most dauntless highwaymen and bearable only to toads and rats". One apparently diabetic army officer {{who died in the}} strong room—he had been ejected from the common side because inmates had complained about the smell of his urine—had his face eaten by rats within hours of his death, according to a witness.|$|E
500|$|When William Acton ran {{the jail}} in the 1720s, the income from charities, {{collected}} {{to buy food}} for inmates on the common side, was directed instead {{to a group of}} trusted prisoners who policed the prison on Acton's behalf. The same group swore during Acton's trial in 1729 for murder that the <b>strong</b> <b>room</b> was the best room in the house. Ginger writes that Acton and his wife, who lived in a comfortable apartment near the lodge, knew they were sitting on a powder keg: [...] "When each morning the smell of freshly baked bread filled... the yard... only brutal suppression could prevent the Common Side from erupting." ...|$|E
25|$|UCL's most {{significant}} works {{are housed in}} the <b>Strong</b> <b>Rooms.</b> The special collection includes first editions of Isaac Newton's Principia, Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species and James Joyce's Ulysses. The earliest book in the collection is The crafte to lyve well and to dye well, printed in 1505.|$|R
50|$|In 1925 the {{building}} was converted {{for use by the}} Irrigation and Water Supply Commission. A three-storeyed wing designed by the Public Works Department was added at the rear of {{the building}} by day labour at a cost of £4,500. The addition included in the basement, a printing <b>room</b> and <b>strong</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "In Captain <b>Strong's</b> <b>rooms!</b> oh, {{let us go}} to Captain Strong's rooms," [...] {{cried out}} Miss Blanche. [...] "I know him very well. You dearest little girl, show us the way to Captain Strong!" [...] cried out Miss Blanche, for the floor reeked with the recent scrubbing, and the goddess {{did not like the}} smell of brown-soap.|$|R
2500|$|The {{rectangular}} temple is {{the most}} common and best-known form of Greek public architecture. This rectilinear structure borrows from the Late Helladic, Mycenaean Megaron, which contained a central throne room, vestibule, and porch. The temple did not serve the same function as a modern church, since the altar stood under the open sky in the temenos or sacred precinct, often directly before the temple. Temples served as the location of a cult image and as a storage place or <b>strong</b> <b>room</b> for the treasury associated with the cult of the god in question, and as a place for devotees of the god to leave their votive offerings, such as statues, helmets and weapons. Some Greek temples appear to have been [...] oriented astronomically. The temple was generally part of a religious precinct known as the acropolis. According to Aristotle, '"the site should be a spot seen far and wide, which gives good elevation to virtue and towers over the neighbourhood". Small circular temples, tholos were also constructed, as well as small temple-like buildings that served as treasuries for specific groups of donors.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't see {{any signs}} of any more, admiral. There are the two plate chests in the passage, {{as if they had}} been brought out from the butler's <b>strong</b> <b>room,</b> in {{readiness}} to take away." ...|$|E
60|$|So saying, he ushered his {{prisoner}} into a cell, {{or rather}} a <b>strong</b> <b>room</b> {{of the better}} order, in which there were four chairs, a truckle-bed, {{and one or two}} other articles of furniture.|$|E
50|$|A large two-storey storage {{building}} and two barracks were also uncovered, {{but the greatest}} interest centered around the principia as its two <b>strong</b> <b>rooms</b> were very well preserved as were several office rooms. On {{the completion of the}} investigation the remains were preserved beneath the basilica (along with the remains of the Constantinian cathedral and a Neronian domus) in a spectacular underground archaeological park.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{building was}} sold to Barlett Gurney in 1779 {{for the purpose of}} establishing the Gurney Bank. Gurney also installed bullion safes in the former wine cellars. In 1896, 20 banks including the Gurney Bank were amalgamated under the name of Barclay & Co Ltd. Barclays soon outgrew their premises and in 1926 a new building was designed with a huge banking hall, offices and <b>strong</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Countries {{in which}} the bourgeois form of {{production}} is developed to a certain extent, limit the hoards concentrated in the <b>strong</b> <b>rooms</b> of the banks to the minimum required for the proper performance of their peculiar functions. Whenever these hoards are strikingly above their average level, it is, with some exceptions, an indication of stagnation in the circulation of commodities, of an interruption in the even flow of their metamorphoses.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{can make}} nothing of Captain Jansen, {{as he calls}} himself, Mac-Guffog, and it's now too late to bundle him off to the county jail. Is there not a <b>strong</b> <b>room</b> up yonder in the old castle?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am coming,--I am coming," [...] {{said the}} person who {{answered}} to that appellative; and then reiterating hastily, [...] "For God's sake--for your own sake--for my sake, flee, or they'll take your life!" [...] he left the <b>strong</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "But how can I {{speak to}} the point, as your honour ca's it," [...] said Ratcliffe, demurely, and {{with an air of}} great simplicity, [...] "when ye ken I was under {{sentence}} and in the <b>strong</b> <b>room</b> a' the while the job was going on?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The London Silver Vaults {{is a large}} {{subterranean}} {{market that}} opened as The Chancery Lane Safe Deposit on 7 May 1885. Originally renting out <b>strong</b> <b>rooms</b> to hold household silver, jewellery and documents, it transitioned to housing silver dealers in secure premises a few years later. It is located on Chancery Lane, London, WC2A 1QS. One vault was used to store a farthing, with the owner paying over [...] over the years for the vault.|$|R
50|$|It was {{announced}} by the government that the seized notes will {{be brought into the}} mainstream as soon as possible to ease out the cash problem. Earlier, agencies kept all seized material, including cash seizures, in their <b>strong</b> <b>rooms</b> as evidence till the case was adjudicated by the courts. The seized money was then deposited into the Consolidated Fund of India. Sometimes, income tax cases took years to resolve, still all seized material was kept in safe lockers of the tax department.|$|R
50|$|Smithfield Chambers {{is still}} used by Power and Cartwright. The ground floor, {{including}} the former shop spaces, {{is used as}} offices, and the first floor is only partially utilised. The two staircases from the street level {{to the first floor}} still exist, although only the northwest one is in use. A large space at the centre rear of the first floor has been partitioned. There are still two <b>strong</b> <b>rooms</b> on the ground floor, and one on the first floor.|$|R
60|$|He at once {{turned to}} {{the walls of his}} cell. These were not built of the unbaked clay so largely used for houses of the poorer class in Northern Egypt, but had evidently been {{constructed}} either as a prison, or more probably as a <b>strong</b> <b>room</b> where some merchant kept valuable goods. It was therefore constructed of blocks of hard stone.|$|E
6000|$|... "And now I {{have told}} you so much, my son, I will tell you {{of the events of}} that evening. For some days I had been low and out of sorts; a {{haunting}} sense that something was wrong had been upon me. The last clerk, before leaving, had, as usual, laid the keys on the desk beside me. I told him he could go, as I had some hours' work before me. For an hour I went through the books, and then a sudden impulse seized me. I would examine some of the securities and see that none were missing. I took the keys and went down to the <b>strong</b> <b>room,</b> a thing which I never that I can recall had done after the bank was shut; took out some large parcels of shares and bonds, and locked the doors again. I took them up with me to count in my room, and compare them with the books. I had just set to work when I heard the latch-key of the front door turn, and a minute later Mr. Johnstone came in. 'You are at work late, Partridge,' he said. 'I saw your light burning as I was passing. Why, hallo!' he said with a change of voice, 'what have you got all the securities up for? that is rather unusual, isn't it? Wasn't the <b>strong</b> <b>room</b> locked up before the clerks went away?' It had not struck me that there was anything strange about it, but the tone of the president's voice showed me that there was, and my old nervousness seized me as if with a sudden grip; and I have no doubt that the tone in which I explained my reason for going down into the <b>strong</b> <b>room</b> and bringing up the securities added to his suspicion. However, he said coldly: 'I am not aware of anything that should have excited your suspicions that all was not right, and induced you to unlock the <b>strong</b> <b>room</b> after the bank was closed. However, as you have brought up some of the securities, and I have nothing to do for the next half-hour, I will go through them with you.' ...|$|E
60|$|That was {{all very}} well; but the king had a little boy of ten years old who went {{to look at the}} hairy man also, and the man begged so hard to be set free that the boy took pity on him. He stole the key of the <b>strong</b> <b>room</b> from his mother and opened the door. Then he took the key back, but the hairy man escaped and went off into the world.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} was designed {{in a typical}} bank design of the time, with the ground floor being the main chamber and offices space. The only public entrance was through Collins Street. It was paved in stone to differentiate {{the public and the}} private (tenants) spaces. The basement was mainly occupied by the bank’s vault (<b>strong</b> <b>rooms),</b> while two smaller vaults were put on the ground floor to help the daily business of the bank. Offices and rooms for the clerks occupied the top floor.|$|R
60|$|He {{could see}} that she was {{offended}} with him for asking her to go home. But she was his girl; he only pitied her. He shook hands with her as usual, and kissed her with the old stoicism; but his lips, set to fierceness by the life-long habit of sarcasm, trembled as he turned away. She was eager to have him go; for she had given him Miss <b>Strong's</b> <b>room,</b> and had taken the girl into her own, and Bartley would not like it if he came back and found her there.|$|R
60|$|Yet {{even when}} his eyes were opened on the mist and rain, on the moving patch {{of light from the}} lamps, and the hedge at the {{roadside}} retreating by jerks, the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train of the night shadows within. The real Banking-house by Temple Bar, the real business of the past day, the real <b>strong</b> <b>rooms,</b> the real express sent after him, and the real message returned, would all be there. Out of the midst of them, the ghostly face would rise, and he would accost it again.|$|R
