40|$|This paper {{presents}} the basic flow structures {{in a river}} bend in a physical model with and without a <b>submerged</b> <b>weir.</b> The CCHE 2 D model and the CCHE 3 D model for free surface and turbulent flows, which have been extensively validated and verified in recent years, are combined to study the flow in the channel in both the presence and absence of a <b>submerged</b> <b>weir,</b> where the water surface elevations and velocities are measured for certain flow conditions and in certain ranges. A 2 D model is {{used to determine the}} water edge and to calibrate the bed roughness for the 3 D model. A 3 D model, after calibration and validation with the physical model data, is used to investigate the flow structure in the channel both in the presence and absence of a <b>submerged</b> <b>weir.</b> The agreement between the measured velocities (surface elevations) and the simulated velocities is reasonably good, which indicates that the CCHE 3 D model is capable of investigating the flow structure of such a channel. It is found that the <b>submerged</b> <b>weir</b> has a significant effect on the flow in the channel, and that the largest influence appears {{in the vicinity of the}} weir. Secondary flows, which are key to navigational conditions, undergo a process of break up when the flow approaches the weir, and develop into single, two, and three secondary flow zones downstream of the weir and then decay from three to two secondary flow zones and finally revert to a single secondary flow zone.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a short study {{to examine the}} behaviour of submerged flow over a thin plate weir with differing upstream and downstream bed levels i. e. an unequal bed weir {{as opposed to an}} equal bed weir where the upstream and downstream beds are at the same level. As <b>submerged</b> <b>weir</b> flow is a function of downstream conditions, it was thought that a lower downstream bed would make submerged flow over the weir easier, This is turn suggested that; 	The shape of the upstream head (Hu) vs downstream head (Hd) graph would change, being initially more steep in the unequal bed case. 	The Froude Number of the approaching flow would be lower for the unequal bed weir than for an equal bed weir at the same submergence. 	Using one of the existing submerged flow formula would lead to an erroneous calculated value. A series of measurements was done on two model weirs of different sizes subject to successive levels of submergence. Analysis of the readings of upstream and downstream heads indicated that the difference in bed levels was significant and the three effects above were noted. The work also suggested a new form of equation to calculate flow over a <b>submerged</b> <b>weir.</b> This was looked at briefly...|$|E
40|$|Small tidal inlets {{are found}} to be more {{sensitive}} to anthropogenic alteration than their larger counterparts. Such alterations, although typically supported by technical design reports, sometimes require amendments or modification. One of the most suitable tools to conduct the necessary studies in this regard is numerical modelling, since the behaviour of the inlet system in response to proposed remedial actions, can easily be identified. In this paper, various alternative proposals are investigated to determine the most practical and viable option to mitigate the need for ongoing maintenance at a typical small, jettied tidal inlet. The main tool to investigate the alternatives is the hydro-sedimentological modelling of the inlet system, which was performed using the Delft 3 D software package. The proposed alternative entrance modifications were based upon structural alterations of the inlet system (such as a jetty extension or <b>submerged</b> <b>weir)</b> and non-structural scenarios (such as a change of the time of the dredging campaign or the deposition location of the dredged material). It was concluded that whilst a detailed study is inevitable in order to achieve a comprehensive design plan, based upon {{the results of this study}} the construction of a <b>submerged</b> <b>weir</b> at the entrance channel can satisfy the needs of most of the stakeholders, with justifiable costs over a longer period.

40|$|Little {{is known}} of how fish respond to the {{hydraulic}} environment associated with diversion or bypass structures at hydroelectric power installations. To address this lack of knowledge, this paper presents results from a study to assess how three species of Pacific salmonid smolt (Oncorhynchus spp.) responded to distinct gradients of velocity and depth associated with two <b>submerged</b> <b>weirs</b> as they passed through an experimental flume at McNary Dam (Columbia River, USA) under illuminated and dark conditions. Migrating smolts entered one of two available treatment channels as coherent schools from which individuals would either disassociate from the group and pass over the weirs, or would reject them by swimming upstream. Alternatively, fish maintained position at the upstream end of the flume by swimming into the flow. The response of smolts to velocity and depth gradient and light condition varied between species, and route of passage was influenced by fork length. Initial channel selection and school size was not influenced by weir type, although schools resided longer within the short-weir channel. The majority of smolts (70 %) entered the treatment channels facing downstream (negative rheotaxis), but switched orientation at the crests of the weirs. This switch in orientation occurred farther downstream in the short-weir treatment and for the largest smolts. The variation in response of different species of smolts to hydraulic gradients {{has important implications for}} the design of screening mechanisms used at hydroelectric power installations to divert migrant juvenile salmonids.

40|$|In large braided rivers, river {{training}} is often required {{to protect the}} banks against erosion, to improve navigability and for land reclamation. Closing one of the channels is a promising option to achieve these goals. However, {{there is a lack}} of systematic research on channel closures and no guidelines for their use exist. In the few documented cases, the river reopened the closed branch by eroding a channel across the island that separated the channels. The goal of this study is to analyse the consequences of closure, find the variables that affect channel reopening and provide guidelines for channel closures. The problem is studied with a numerical Delft 3 D model. A simplified reference case is set up, with two branches separated by an island. It is based on typical reaches of large braided rivers. Initially, one of the channels is closed with a combination of a weir in the channel and a short embankment on the island. A bypass channel is eroded around the weir in the first weeks of the wet season. A sensitivity analysis of different physical properties is performed in order to determine how general the simplified case is. Quantitative results vary, but the qualitative morphological response to closure remains similar. The largest part of the study consists of analysing simulations with various interventions. Combinations of a weir in the channel and embankment on the island, multiple weirs, roughness elements, vegetation and partial closures with bandals are tested in different positions along the channel. Analysis is extended by including simulations with higher water levels, four additional geometries and some longer-term simulations. Finally, aggregated results are analysed to find connections between variables. Channel reopening due to formation of channels on the island is the main cause of reduction in closure effectiveness. Bypass channels of varied depth form around the intervention in most cases. Channels across the island mostly occur when longer embankments are used. Their extent is less predictable and increases in time, so they should be avoided. The type of channel on the island that will most likely develop can be predicted from the initial hydrodynamic conditions after closure. Correlation between erosion of channels on the island and the initial hydrodynamic conditions is found. The water level gradient is the most important parameter that determines the location and degree of channel erosion. Water depth on the island plays a role when water levels are relatively low. Higher water levels cause more erosion, which can be mostly prevented with the use of <b>submerged</b> <b>weirs.</b> Flow patterns on the island determine the exact position of the eroded channels and directly contribute to erosion. Sediment supply to the newly formed channels reduces their growth. Deposition in the closed branch improves conditions over time, especially with interventions that do not block the channel fully. Length and width of the island play a role in the extent of erosion on the island, whereas channel and bifurcation asymmetry mostly do not. The best overall solution is found to be a combination of a weir with a long embankment or roughness elements. Further details, such as position of the interventions and weir crest height, depend on goals of closure and water levels in the system. Civil engineerin...|$|R
40|$|With the {{advances}} in numerical methods, {{three dimensional models}} for free surface turbulent flows have been accepted as a tool in the hydraulic research and applied to studies of flow field, sediment transport and pollutant transport for engineering projects. Because {{of the complexity of}} the flow physics, numerical model simulations are only approximations to the real physical processes. Comparing with the physical model data, Physical Validation, {{is the only way to}} exam weather or not the predictions of a numerical model can reflect the true physics concerned. In this paper, several cases of validating a three-dimensional free-surface turbulence flow model, CCHE 3 D, using physical model data, such as free overfall flow, curved channel flows and flow over a <b>submerged</b> <b>weir,</b> are presented. These cases indicate that dynamic pressures, free surface algorithms and sophisticated turbulence closure schemes, etc. are essential to predicting correct physics in turbulent flows...|$|E
40|$|Groynes are {{commonly}} used in the major rivers in the Netherlands. They confine {{the flow of the}} river to a main channel but also act as resistance element once submerged and in that way influence the stage discharge relationship of the river. Several formulas exist describing groynes as a drag resistance. Another possible way of determining their resistance is by using a weir formula and fitting the up and downstream water levels to the water level slope of the river. In this thesis a schematized model of the river Waal is set up and progressively expanded. At first seven different drag and weir formulas are compared. There is no consensus for resistance is between them. They are therefor compared to a 2 DV computer model of flow over a highly <b>submerged</b> <b>weir</b> in the SWASH software package. Drag resistance, expressed as a function of water depth to groyne height ratio has the same scaling as two weir formulas though they do not match in absolute terms. A 2 DH computer model is then used to determine the magnitude of the lateral turbulent momentum exchange between the main channel, groyne fields and flood plain. Finally a 3 D computer model is used to determine groyne resistance and the distribution of discharge and momentum around the groyne. Treating groynes as weirs is found to be an acceptable assumption. The schematized model is used to simulate a high discharge of 13. 550 m 3 s- 1. Groynes, when seen as a weir, would be responsible for a 36 cm water level increase. Lateral turbulent momentum exchange increases this by another 34 cm, while using the groyne resistance found in the 3 D model added only another 7 cm.

40|$|Submerged flow {{exists for}} any given {{structure}} when a change in flow depth downstream from the structure causes a change in flow depth upstream from the structure {{for any given}} constant value of discharge. The two flow depths, normally measured when submerged flow exists, consist of a depth upstream from the structure, which is used also for free flow conditions, and a depth of flow located any place downstream from the structure. The initial studies in which the submerged flow analysis was developed were made on flat-bottomed flumes (Hyatt, 1965; and Skogerboe, Walker, and Robinson, 1965). Later studies verified the method of analysis for Parshall flumes (Skogerboe, Hyatt, England, and John son, 1965; and Hyatt, Skogerboe, and Eggleston, 1966). Because of previous findings, it was felt this method of analyzing submerged flow {{could be applied to}} various types and kinds of weirs. Original development of the parameters and relationships which describe submerged flow came from a combination of dimensional analysis and empiricism. Further verification of the parameters developed in this manner are obtained by employing momentum relationships. Both approaches to the submerged flow problem are discussed in this report. Considerable effort and study has been expended on free and <b>submerged</b> flow <b>weirs</b> by other authors in previous years. For this reason the authors of this report went to the literature as a source of data. Various studies typifying a particular type of weir structure were investigated and the data selected from these studies were subjected to the submerged flow analysis developed by the authors. The data from these studies provide further verification of validity of the approach to the submerged flow problem made by the authors. Acknowledgement is given and appreciation expressed to those authors whose studies provided the data used in the analysis presented in this report. Although no investigation was made of a contracted weir, the authors feel that the submerged flow analysis as explained in this report would be just as valid for this type of structure...|$|R

The influences of height for low-wall of turbulence inhibitor, dam height, weir depth, distance between dam and <b>weir,</b> <b>submerged</b> depth of ladle shroud and casting speed on flow field in the tundish have been studied in a 1 : 3 reduced scale hydrodynamic model. The streamlines, velocity vector fields and temperature profiles are also mathematically simulated. The hydrodynamic modelling results indicate that height for low-wall of turbulence inhibitor, dam height and weir depth are three important structural parameters on flow field of molten stainless steel in the tundish. The optimization of the three parameters can improve dispersed plug zone and reduce dead zone effectively. Changing casting speed can improve turbulent flow, and thus reduce dead zone of molten stainless steel in the tundish. As a result, five groups of optimized structural parameters of the tundish have been recommended, which can reduce volume fraction of dead zone down to 15 - 30 % and increase volume fraction of dispersed plug zone to more than 20 %. In addition, it is verified that the optimized groups of structural parameters of the tundish can maintain their advantage at different casting speeds in a narrow range. The mathematical modelling results suggest that heat losses around the tundish {{must be considered in}} order to accurately simulate the streamline, velocity vector field and temperature profile. The calculated temperature drop of molten stainless steel between inlet and outlet of the tundish is about 4. 4 K; the maximum temperature drop in the whole tundish is about 10 K, The modification of flow filed by changing structural parameters of the tundish can slightly affect temperature profile of molten stainless steel in the tundish.

40|$|Facilities {{for passing}} fish {{upstream}} over Lower Monumental Dam include a powerhouse fish collection system, auxiliary water supply systems, and a fish ladder {{on each side}} of the river. The main portions of the 16 -ft-wide fish ladders are constructed with a floor slope of 1 on 10. The 6 -ft-high weirs have two 18 - by 18 -in. orifices on the floor 3 ft from the fish ladder walls, a 6 -ft-long nonoverflow section centered in the ladders, and fins that extend 18 in. upstream from the ends of the nonoverflow sections. The weir crests are like those in the north fish ladder at John Day Dam. Auxiliary water for transportation flow in the ladders and attraction flows at the fishway entrances is pumped through supply conduits and distributed through six diffusion chambers in the floor of each ladder. Flow control for the downstream diffuser is provided by sluice gates from the supply conduit; flow in the other five diffusers is automatically controlled by a weir-and-orifice arrangement in the diffuser walls. A straight, 35 -pool section of the south fish ladder was reproduced in a 1 : 10 -scale model. Tests in the model indicated that flow conditions in the typical pools would be satisfactory. Discharges of 66. 0 and 69. 7 cfs produced heads of 10. 0 and 12. 0 in., respectively, on the weirs. With 18 - by 18 -in. orifices in all weirs, heads of 12. 2 and 13. 4 in. were required to provide the above discharges at the first weir below the fish counting station. Discharge rating data for a typical fishway entrance weir was measured in a 1 : 10 -scale model. The quantity of flow increased with submergence and decreased with weir height. A maximum discharge of 227. 5 cfs per ft of channel width was obtained with no weir and 14 ft of submergence.
