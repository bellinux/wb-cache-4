During the most important ceremonies the list is recited in its entirety back over 50 generations to the first Akha, Sm Mi O. It is said that all Akha males <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. The recounting of this lineage {{plays a role in}} the incest taboo: If a male and female Akha find a common male ancestor within their last six generations, they are not allowed to marry.|$|E
500|$|... "Shapes" [...] {{was written}} after {{executives}} at Fox {{had suggested that}} the series should feature a [...] "more conventional" [...] type of monster, and producers James Wong and Glen Morgan began looking into Native American legends of the Manitou to {{form the basis of}} the episode's concept, believing that [...] "a horror show <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> these legends that have been around since the thirteen hundreds". The episode made mention of the first X-File case to have been opened, apparently initiated by J. Edgar Hoover in 1946; whilst it also references the events of the earlier first season episode [...] "Beyond the Sea", as Scully is seen discussing her father's death. [...] "Shapes" [...] marked the first time an episode of The X-Files had made use of Native American themes and folklore. Whilst this episode was a stand-alone 'monster-of-the-week' story, later episodes beginning with the second season finale [...] "Anasazi", would begin to incorporate Navajo cultural references into the show's overarching mythology.|$|E
500|$|Lindstrom {{explained}} that they integrated the elements of climbing, shooting and puzzle solving. This instalment also features a new melee combat system, requiring Lara in some instances to use [...] "direct combat and evasive manoeuvres to distance herself from her attacker". Notably, Lara's bike, among other things, is a key component in solving the puzzles she will encounter in her adventure. Pick-ups have multiple uses as weapons and tools in interaction with the environment, and Lindstrom stated that Lara [...] "can also split up her guns and fire at two different targets simultaneously," [...] or hold an item {{with one hand and}} fire a gun with the other. The grappling hook can be stretched taut and used to pull objects off ledges, illustrating what project lead Rob Pavey said, that [...] "Lara {{will be able to do}} anything that you'd expect her to be able to do," [...] which he called [...] "the big theme this year." [...] Lindstrom describes this as [...] "a philosophy called 'What Could Lara Do?'—WCLD. It's short-hand for having the player be able to use their own intuition about what someone with her abilities <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in an environment such as this, and consistency across the different mechanics and abilities. If she can throw a grenade, then if she can pick up this pole, why can't she throw it?" [...] Crystal Dynamics also made the game non-linear, offering elaborate multi-stage puzzles.|$|E

2500|$|In The Selfish Gene, Richard Dawkins {{describes}} {{an approach to}} life-extension that involves [...] "fooling genes" [...] into thinking the body is young. Dawkins attributes inspiration for this idea to Peter Medawar. The basic idea is that our bodies are composed of genes that activate throughout our lifetimes, some when we are young and others when we are older. Presumably, these genes are activated by environmental factors, and the changes caused by these genes activating can be lethal. It is a statistical certainty that we possess more lethal genes that activate in later life than in early life. Therefore, to extend life, {{we should be able}} to prevent these genes from switching on, and we <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so by [...] "identifying changes in the internal chemical environment of a body that take place during aging... and by simulating the superficial chemical properties of a young body".|$|E
