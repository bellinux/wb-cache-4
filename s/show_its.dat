However, {{when he returns}} to New York {{following}} the nuptials he discovers that he is instead married to his employee and friend Liz Lemon (Tina Fey). At the wedding, Liz was Jack's best man and wore a white shirt with a head net while Avery wore a black dress. As {{a result of what}} Liz was wearing, the minister (Jean Brassard) instead married Jack and Liz. He informs Liz that the minister married the two of them instead of him and Avery. The two set out for a divorce, however, TGS with Tracy Jordan producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) tells Liz not to sign the divorce papers as she can use their marriage to her advantage as TGS—a show she is the head writer for—is affected by budget cuts at NBC as part of the merger with the fictional network company Kabletown. She demands that Jack, an executive at NBC, give the <b>show</b> <b>its</b> lost budget but he denies the request, as a result Liz will not sign the divorce papers unless her conditions are met.|$|E
5|$|Madonna's {{performance}} was the most-watched Super Bowl halftime show in history, with 114million viewers– {{more than the}} game itself, which had 111.3million viewers. According to the Nielsen ratings, the show had a 47.4 household rating; among adults 18–49 it had a 41.5 rating, compared with the game average of 40.5. Reuters noted that the half-hour from 9:30 to 9:58 ET peaked at a 50.7 household rating and a 72 share, with 117.7 million viewers. The record was broken by Bruno Mars in 2014 (115 million) and Katy Perry in 2015 (118 million). Madonna set a record as the most-tweeted subject on Twitter (10,245 posts in one second, {{with an average of}} 8,000 tweets per second for five minutes) and was the most-searched term on Google during the show. Wired CEO Mark Ghuneim tweeted that less than one-third of the tweets were negative, 59 percent were positive and 11 percent were neutral. According to Billboard, the day after the <b>show</b> <b>its</b> ratings and economic impact were discussed.|$|E
5|$|Securing the {{favour of}} the priesthood was {{essential}} for the Ptolemaic kings to retain effective rule over the populace. The High Priests of Memphis—where the king was crowned—were particularly important, as they were the highest religious authorities {{of the time and}} had influence throughout the kingdom. Given that the decree was issued at Memphis, the ancient capital of Egypt, rather than Alexandria, the centre of government of the ruling Ptolemies, it is evident that the young king was anxious to gain their active support. Thus, although the government of Egypt had been Greek-speaking ever since the conquests of Alexander the Great, the Memphis decree, like the two preceding decrees in the series, included texts in Egyptian to <b>show</b> <b>its</b> connection to the general populace by way of the literate Egyptian priesthood.|$|E

5|$|The {{nucleus of}} the helium-4 atom is {{identical}} with an alpha particle. High-energy electron-scattering experiments <b>show</b> <b>its</b> charge to decrease exponentially from a maximum at a central point, exactly as does the charge density of helium's own electron cloud. This symmetry reflects similar underlying physics: the pair of neutrons and the pair of protons in helium's nucleus obey the same quantum mechanical rules as do helium's pair of electrons (although the nuclear particles are subject to a different nuclear binding potential), so that all these fermions fully occupy 1s orbitals in pairs, none of them possessing orbital angular momentum, and each cancelling the other's intrinsic spin. Adding another {{of any of these}} particles would require angular momentum and would release substantially less energy (in fact, no nucleus with five nucleons is stable). This arrangement is thus energetically extremely stable for all these particles, and this stability accounts for many crucial facts regarding helium in nature.|$|E
