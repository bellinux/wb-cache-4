50|$|After {{witnessing}} {{firsthand the}} dangers of deploying and retrieving BTs, James M. Snodgrass began developing the expendable bathythermograph (XBT). Snodgrass' description of the XBT:Briefly, the unit would break down in two components, as follows: the ship to surface unit, and surface to expendable unit. I have in mind a package which could be jettisoned, either by the “Armstrong” method, or some simple mechanical device, which would at all times {{be connected to the}} surface vessel. The wire would be paid out from the surface ship and not from the <b>surface</b> <b>float</b> unit. The <b>surface</b> <b>float</b> would require a minimum of flotation and a small, very simple sea anchor. From this simple platform the expendable BT unit would sink as outlined for the acoustic unit. However, it would unwind as it goes a very fine thread of probably neutrally buoyant conductor terminating at the float unit, thence connected to the wire leading to the ship. In the early 1960s the U.S. Navy contracted Sippican Corporation of Marion, Massachusetts to develop the XBT, who became the sole supplier.|$|R
40|$|Use of <b>surface</b> <b>floating</b> {{dredgers}} in deep inland reservoirs and continental shelves, {{either for}} dredging or mining is restricted by several operational limitations and mobilization problems. Ladder length {{is a major}} constraint {{and in the absence}} of good approach roads, transportation of bigger <b>surface</b> <b>floating</b> dredgers to inland areas is difficult. In shelf areas, dredging operation is less precise due to currents, waves and winds. Use of small, modular comparatively less expensive submersible dredgers/ miners is a suitable solution to some of the above-mentioned problems. A collaborative research project between Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada and Excavation & Equipment Manufacturing (P) Ltd., India was set up to develop, design, build and test a small prototype of a modular walking submersible dredger suitable for deep inland reservoirs. The full-scale electrohydraulically operated prototype was remotely operated on land for all the full-scale prototype tests. This paper describes the theoretical gait plans developed for the designed vehicle to perform straight line and curvilinear locomotion on natural terrain. Representative results showing the comparisons between the theoretical and experimental results for the gait plans are presented...|$|R

40|$|Wehypothesized that a <b>floating</b> <b>trawl</b> bridle {{that does}} not contact the seabed would reduce the herding of fish, {{especially}} bottom dwelling floun-ders, and thus reduce bycatch of these fish in shrimp trawls. We further hypothesized that, due to the non-herding nature of northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis), the use of anoff-bottomfloating bridlewouldnot reduce shrimp catch. These hypotheseswere tested in the field by comparing a trawl with regular bottom-tendering wire bridles and the same <b>trawl</b> with <b>floating</b> synthetic bridles in the Gulf of Maine northern shrimp fishery. As expected, {{no statistically significant differences}} in catch rates and size were found for the targeted northern shrimp (146. 3 + 10. 58 kg h 21 control vs. 140. 8 + 9. 35 kg h 21, p 0. 13). Total finfish bycatch was reduced by 14. 9 %, and the difference was statistically different (p 0. 01). The most important reduction was the catch of juvenile American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides) with a significant reduction of 20. 0 % (p 0. 01). For witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus), a reduction of 19. 3 % was found, but it was not statistically significant (p 0. 14). The reduction of Acadian redfish (Sebastes fasciatus) (by 28. 0 %, p 0. 02) was also statistically different. Catch of targeted silver hake (Merluccius bilinearis) was reduced by 10. 8 %, but the difference was only marginally significant (p 0. 07). An analysis of length frequencies for the targeted shrimp and major bycatch species revealed no size-related selection between the gears with regular bridles and floating bridles. The reductions in flounder bycatch indicate reduced herding of benthic species when the bridles are kept off bottom. This easy modificatio...|$|R
