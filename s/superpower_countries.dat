50|$|While this {{decolonization}} {{movement was}} occurring, a global crisis also hung over France's head: the Cold War. The Cold War {{was a time}} of military and political tensions between two <b>superpower</b> <b>countries</b> that had emerged from World War II: The United States and the Soviet Union. Even though this war was not directly fought with France, it still affected {{every country in the world}} as they spread their respective spheres of influence politically and economically. The United States feared communism and any ideology surrounding it and the Soviet Union was scared of the power of the United States in its ability to build the atomic bomb. These tensions led to the Cold War manifesting itself into an arms race then evolving to a race to spread the most influence on the world and thus interference in the many decolonization movements that followed World War II. Although the two superpowers did not interfere much in the Algerian War, the spreading of their spheres of influence affected the world.|$|E
50|$|The Madiun Affair {{should be}} placed in an {{international}} context in which two <b>superpower</b> <b>countries</b> {{played a role in}} the Indonesian government's decision making. Suripno was a young communist who became the representative of the Republic of Indonesia at the Congress of World Federation of Democratic Youth in Prague in 1947. He was also given a mandate to contact the Soviet Union. On January 1948, he met a Russian ambassador and discussed future consular relationship between Russia and Indonesia. The Soviet government finally took the initiative by informing Suripno that the Consular Treaty had been rectified. Instead of accepting the treaty, Hatta's government decided to suspend the bilateral relationship. Suripno was then asked to return to Indonesia. On August 11, 1948 Suripno arrived at Jogjakarta with his 'secretary' who turned out to be Musso, a senior Indonesian communist leader. When asked to give official report to the Minister of Foreign Affairs Haji Agus Salim, Suripno praised Russia for its political stance that had always acknowledged Indonesia as a sovereign state.|$|E

40|$|The {{mainstream}} {{of the early}} history of computing is generally ascribed to British and American efforts during the 1940 s– 50 s. A number of European pioneers were disconnected from this mainstream by time, most singularly Charles Babbage, or by a combination of geography, politics, and language. The latter include Konrad Zuse, now recognized for building the first binary, digital computer anywhere, {{and a number of other}} Europeans who built the first computers in their respective countries [4]. S. A. Lebedev, whose centenary was last November, was one of the most accomplished, but least known, of these “isolated ” pioneers. Between 1947 – 51 he designed and built the MESM, the first operational all-electronic, digital, stored-program, generalpurpose computer on continental Europe, and did so under extraordinarily difficult circumstances. He was responsible for more than 15 subsequent models that were used to work on many high-priority problems in the Soviet Union, including the machine that came closest to closing the “computing gap ” with the West during the Cold War. For over two decades, he actively combined a position as chief designer and CEO-equivalent in a <b>superpower</b> <b>country,</b> a long-term achievement unique among early computer scientists.

While the nation keep steady in its condition, the government must overcome the situation to improve their foreign policy because the need of interaction with its national, regional and international society is the one thing that a nation cannot resist. Secret diplomacy of Qatar through Al-Jazeera Television, Qatar’ mass media, is the way that Qatar choose to support their foreign policy. State branding, that media could afford to its owner, is the form of secret diplomacy for a small state like Qatar to survive and compete in international politics arena without harming the nation but also improving its diplomacy.

Al-Jazeera plays a bargaining role in its relations with this two important countries. Another significant role of Al-Jazeera in achieving success diplomacy for Qatar was the fact that Qatar has been choosen to be a host in many international event and conferences.

25|$|Cold War {{conflicts}} between the United States and the Soviet Union, {{as well as the}} policies of the International Monetary Fund, also played a role in instability. When a country became independent for the first time, it was often expected to align with one of the two <b>superpowers.</b> Many <b>countries</b> in Northern Africa received Soviet military aid, while others in Central and Southern Africa were supported by the United States, France or both. The 1970s saw an escalation of Cold War intrigues, as newly independent Angola and Mozambique aligned themselves with the Soviet Union, and the West and South Africa sought to contain Soviet influence by supporting friendly regimes or insurgency movements. In Rhodesia, Soviet and Chinese-backed leftist guerrillas of the Zimbabwe Patriotic Front waged a brutal guerrilla war against the country's white government. There was a major famine in Ethiopia, when {{hundreds of thousands of people}} starved. Some claimed that Marxist economic policies made the situation worse. The most devastating military conflict in modern independent Africa has been the Second Congo War; this conflict and its aftermath has killed an estimated 5.5 million people. Since 2003 there has been an ongoing conflict in Darfur which has become a humanitarian disaster.

A 1999 USAF report calls for the US bomber fleet to remain in service until the late 2030s-early 2040s, and the B-21 is scheduled to reach deployment in the 2020s.

China has instituted a methodical and scrupulous 2 ̆ 2 calculative strategy 2 ̆ 2, which has propelled them into Asian leadership. The primary component of China’s long term strategy is to systematically encircle India by embroiling them in regional affairs detrimental to India’s larger Asian ambitions. China has engaged and armed South Asian countries such as Pakistan, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bhutan. India has countered China’s advances by courting Southeast Asian and East Asian countries (the Look East Policy). Additionally, China and India have undergone rapprochement in the 21 st century, but this rapprochement is a fagade that will not moderate their antagonistic relationship. Finally, it is imperative for India to emulate China’s realist strategy model to prevent China from engulfing Asia under their hegemonic influence and control...|$|R

In this, Russia has received strong, unconditional international support, which has allowed it to overcome various obstacles, but the difficult transition that the country has been through has made it impossible to avoid a severe collective trauma in terms of ideology and identity. The process has clearly been also accompanied by a significant disregard for the individual and collective rights of the Russian people, a price that, in the long term, may be too high a one to pay for a population that aspires to stability and for a countrythat aspires to respect and to equality {{with the rest of the}} world...|$|R
50|$|Relations {{began to}} improve when Leonid Brezhnev became the Soviet leader in October 1964; however, in the 1973 Kuwait-Iraq Sanita border skirmish, Russia favored Iraq over Kuwait.

The Soviets supported the Kuwaiti's nationalisation of its oil industry, and the two countries shared similar views on foreign policy issues, in particular in relation to the Arab-Israeli conflict. Kuwait appreciated Soviet support for the Palestinians, and after the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq War, the country began to support Soviet proposals in the Persian Gulf after recognising that the Soviet presence in the Persian Gulf was of a stabilising nature, and also as Moscow acted as a guarantor against Iraqi or Iranian aggression. This led to Kuwait actively lobbying members of the Gulf Cooperation Council to establish diplomatic relations with the Soviets, ending the diplomatic isolation of the <b>superpower</b> amongst the <b>countries</b> on the Arabian Peninsula; for most of the Cold War, Kuwait was one of only two countries which maintained such relations with the Soviet Union.|$|R

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} need to study war-related health impacts in Ethiopia and other least developed countries, {{for at least three}} reasons. Firstly, the present peace process emerging world-wide / encouraged by the dismantling of communist regimes and reduced military spending in the West is resulting in the reduced military presence of the <b>superpowers</b> in developing <b>countries.</b> These countries, including Ethiopia, thus have greater opportunities to pursue their own development strategies, including a greater emphasis on human development. Secondly, in the least developed coun-tries health is not only a basic human right but also an urgent prerequisite for broad socioeconomic development. Clearly, health levels in these poor countries are the lowest world-wide but may be significantly raised if resources currently used for the military are relocated for socioeconomic development, including the upgrading of health services and the control of the major killing diseases (Dodge, 1990). Thirdly, morbidity, mortality, the dis-placement of populations and economic hardship due to war have increased in the developing world in recent decades, due to the use of more lethal weapons, increased military spending, and a world-wide in-crease in the number of governments under military control from 26 per cent in 1960 to 57 per cent in 1988 / 89 (Sivard, 1991, p. 19). In fact, all wars taking place in the 1970 s and 1980 s have been fought in developing countries. Another disturbing trend has been the sharp increase in civilian war-related deaths, with nearly 90 per cent of all casualties in the wars fought in 1990 being unarmed civilians, particularly children, women, and the aged.

Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies following the French and Indian War led to the American Revolution, which began in 1775, and the subsequent Declaration of Independence in 1776. The war ended in 1783 with the United States becoming the first country to gain independence from a European power. The current constitution was adopted in 1788, with the first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, being ratified in 1791 to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties.

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} {{recent scholarship}} concerning {{the history of}} US-European energy relations during the Cold War. Its aim is to relate a series of publications dealing specifically with energy to the wider historiographical debate {{about the importance of}} “rethinking American history in the global age. " This chapter seeks to establish a dialogue and exchange between studies about energy {{on the one hand and}} studies about the history of transatlantic relations, decolonization, and the Cold War, on the other. Access to oil shaped in important ways relations between the US and the USSR, as well as between the two <b>superpowers,</b> single European <b>countries</b> and oil producers. Until the latter started nationalizing their resources in the 1970 s, the US controlled over two thirds of the world’s oil wealth, followed by the USSR. Domestic oil supplies and control over foreign oil were crucial in establishing America’s international position during the Cold War, providing the fuel needed for its military apparatus, assuring its industrial growth and allowing it to project its model abroad, by selling cheap gasoline and cars to Europeans. This complex story of how oil shaped the “American Century” intersected in important ways with the redefinition of US-European relations during the Cold War, a topic that scholars have just started to examine. On the one hand, oil was central to the Marshall Plan, allowing western European countries to rebuild their economies, while at the same time assuring their dependence on a resource controlled by the US. On the other hand, oil played a central role in two of the main crises of European colonialism, namely the Anglo-Iranian crisis of 1951 - 1953 and the Suez crisis of 1956, which led the US to substitute Great Britain and France in maintaining stability in the Mediterranean and assuring access to Middle Eastern oil resources. As this chapter argues, one of the consequences of the Suez crisis was not only to push Western European countries to pursue a more forceful economic and political integration inside the European Economic Community (EEC), but also to increase commercial relations between Western Europe and the USSR. is aspect of the Cold War has only recently been addressed by scholars, who have highlighted the importance these exchanges had in shaping transatlantic debates during the 1960 s and, most importantly, in the context of détente. It was especially the 1973 oil shock, however, that transformed the Atlantic Alliance, leading to what some scholars have argued was a crisis in transatlantic relations. The conflict revolved around energy security, and involved a wider set of issues having to do with the future of North-South relations and of the western world as it had emerged out of the ashes of the Second World War. Scholars have begun to investigate the role oil producers had in the oil shock, but much remains to be done to integrate the energy crisis into the international history of the late twentieth century, and to acknowledge the importance the Third World had in shaping the transatlantic world...|$|R
