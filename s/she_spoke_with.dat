5|$|Consisting of six chapters, Madonnaland finds Simone visiting Madonna's birthplace, Bay City, Michigan, where <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> {{the local}} people about the singer. The book also {{analyses}} Madonna's career and fame, with the author delving into her own music career and obscure Bay City bands. Simone had been initially commissioned to write a new biography about the singer. However, due to already available excess content on her, the author felt {{she would not be}} able to find anything new. Instead, she ended up writing Madonnaland about her own failure to create a Madonna biography, why Bay City did not have any commemoration for the singer, as well as unknown music bands, pop culture and celebrity life.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the Duke's health deteriorated. In December 1964, he was {{operated}} on by Michael E. DeBakey in Houston for an aneurysm of the abdominal aorta, and in February 1965 a detached retina {{in his left}} eye was treated by Sir Stewart Duke-Elder. In late 1971, the Duke, who was a smoker from an early age, was diagnosed with throat cancer and underwent cobalt therapy. On 18 May 1972, Queen Elizabeth II visited the Windsors while on a state visit to France; <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> the Duke for fifteen minutes but only the Duchess appeared with the royal party for a photocall as the Duke was too ill.|$|E
5|$|The NAACP hired Elisabeth Freeman, a women's {{suffrage}} activist from New York City, {{to investigate}} the lynching. She had traveled to Texas in late 1915 or early 1916 to help organize the suffrage movement there. After attending a suffrage convention in Dallas in early May, she began her assignment in Waco, posing as a journalist and attempting to interview people about the lynching. She found that almost all residents were reluctant to discuss the event. <b>She</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> town officials and obtained pictures of the lynching from Gildersleeve, who was initially reluctant to provide them. Although she feared for her safety, she enjoyed {{the challenge of the}} investigation. When speaking with city leaders, Freeman convinced them that she planned to defend Waco against criticism when she returned to the north. Some journalists soon grew suspicious of her presence and warned residents not to talk to outsiders. Local African Americans, however, gave her a warm reception.|$|E
60|$|They {{walked on}} in silence a little further. Then <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> again, <b>with</b> some hesitation.|$|R
60|$|I {{remained}} quite still. <b>She</b> <b>spoke</b> now <b>with</b> downcast eyes, and {{one finger}} just touching the water.|$|R
60|$|So <b>she</b> always <b>spoke,</b> <b>with</b> {{the same}} formal and {{measured}} dignity of manner and language.|$|R
25|$|On 29 September 1824, off the Cape Verde Islands, Cumberland {{was on her}} way to Rio de Janeiro when <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> , {{which was}} bound for Bombay. Cumberland arrived at Rio de Janeiro 20 October, but Barkworth was never heard from again.|$|E
25|$|Digby and Eugénie bring Maggie {{home from}} a dance where <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> Martin, who has {{returned}} from India.

In 2012, while serving as an ambassador for the Fundación Vicente Ferrer, she traveled to India where <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> low-caste Indian women with disabilities. In December 2012, she attended an event in support of Intermón Oxfam.|$|E
60|$|The smile had passed, yet <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> now <b>with</b> a half-real, half-affected archness {{that was}} also unlike her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't at {{all know}} about it's being all over," [...] said Mrs. Ray, in a hurried quick tone, and as <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>she</b> blushed <b>with</b> emotion.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>spoke</b> hurriedly, <b>with</b> {{a certain}} nervousness, {{and her eyes}} were fixed anxiously on the door as though she feared that someone would come in.|$|R
25|$|Her play Watch on the Rhine {{opened on}} Broadway on April 1, 1941, {{and ran for}} 378 performances. It won the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award. She wrote the play in 1940, when its call for a united {{international}} alliance against Hitler directly contradicted the Communist position at the time, following the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact of August 1939. Early in 1942, Hellman accompanied the production to Washington, D.C., for a benefit performance where <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> President Roosevelt. Hammett wrote the screenplay for the movie version that appeared in 1943.|$|E
500|$|Isabeau's life is well documented, {{most likely}} because Charles' illness placed {{her in an}} unusual {{position}} of power. Nevertheless, not much is known about her personal characteristics, and historians even disagree about her appearance. She is variously described as [...] "small and brunette" [...] or [...] "tall and blonde". The contemporaneous evidence is contradictory: chroniclers said of her either that she was [...] "beautiful and hypnotic, or so obese through dropsy that she was crippled." [...] Despite living in France after her marriage, <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> a heavy German accent that never diminished, which Tuchman describes as giving her an [...] "alien" [...] cast at the French court.|$|E
500|$|Casting {{negotiations}} for the film's main roles—played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Aaron Paul, Octavia Spencer and Nick Offerman—took place in September 2011. To prepare for her role, Winstead talked with Burke about her recovery and attended {{a variety of}} AA meetings, where <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> other young women who had gotten sober. To act drunk, she used Ivana Chubbuck's method as described in her book The Power of the Actor. Paul said that {{in preparation for the}} film he recorded himself [...] "getting severely intoxicated" [...] and studied the footage. In order to build a rapport together, Winstead and Paul got drunk together the night before filming began, which Winstead described as being [...] "very messy".|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>spoke</b> demurely, <b>with</b> {{laughter}} in her low voice. It made Dorn dare {{to look at}} her, and he met a blue blaze that was instantly averted.|$|R
6000|$|Aunt Penniman, however, took no {{account of}} it; <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> even <b>with</b> {{a touch of}} acrimony. [...] "My dear Catherine, {{you know very well}} that you admire him!" ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2008, she had {{the role}} of [...] "Mlle. Blanche" [...] in Agatha Christie's Poirot for the {{adaptation}} of Cat Among the Pigeons; in it, <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> English <b>with</b> a French accent.|$|R
500|$|Schlesselman {{publicly}} claimed {{white people}} were the master race and would often say [...] "Sieg Heil" [...] and [...] "Heil Hitler." [...] He {{spoke out against}} Obama, saying things like, [...] "Obama would make the world suffer." [...] His anti-racist sister Kayla, who is two years younger than Paul, often argued with him about his racial beliefs. A few days before his arrest, a neighbor said he heard semiautomatic gunfire coming from an open field behind Schlesselman's house. After his arrest, Schlesselman's family expressed doubt that he seriously intended {{to carry out the}} plot; his father, Mike, said, [...] "I think it's just a lot of talk. He would never do something like this." [...] Kayla said <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> her brother after the charges were made public, and that Paul [...] "said he's sorry about everything he's done." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{her profile}} raised by her coming {{out as a}} trans woman in 2015, Jenner {{has been called the}} most famous openly {{transgender}} woman in the world. She {{is also one of the}} most recognized LGBT people in the world and arguably the most famous LGBT athlete. Jenner acknowledged in her 20/20 interview that part of her reason for being so visible was to bring attention to gender dysphoria, violence against trans women, and other transgender issues. [...] She also sought to promote more informed discussion of LGBT issues at a time when the trans community has unprecedented visibility. She signed with Creative Artists Agency's speakers department and will collaborate with the CAA Foundation on a philanthropic strategy focusing on LGBT issues. She made a private appearance at the Los Angeles LGBT Center in June 2015, where <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> at-risk trans youth.|$|E
500|$|In June 2015, Obama {{undertook}} a weeklong trip to London and three Italian cities. In London, <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> students about international education for adolescent girls {{and met with}} both British Prime Minister David Cameron and Prince Harry. She was joined by her two daughters and mother. In November, she spent a week in Qatar, her first official visit to the Middle East. She continued advancing her initiative for international education for women by speaking at the 2015 World Innovation Summit for Education for the [...] "Let Girls Learn" [...] initiative in Doha, Qatar and touring a school in Amman, Jordan, where she met with female students. During the Qatar trip, Obama had intended to visit Jordan as well, but the trip was canceled due to weather conditions. In Jordan, Obama had intended to visit an Amman school, which had been constructed with assistance from U.S. funds.|$|E

60|$|They {{were both}} {{silent for a}} space. Then Mrs. Trafford gave her mind to the tea that was cooling in the cups, and added milk and sugar. <b>She</b> <b>spoke</b> again <b>with</b> the table between them.|$|R
60|$|Although {{she said}} this raging, she said it in a voice so far from being beyond her control that it was even lower than her usual tone. <b>She</b> also <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> great distinctness.|$|R
2500|$|<b>She</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> the deceased's father, Jinda Radappanyawut, {{who later}} {{said she was}} {{concerned}} {{for the welfare of}} the protesters and [...] "would soon send us flowers".

2500|$|Iris (voiced by Ron) was {{an elderly}} Jewish {{woman who lived}} in Brooklyn, and was the most {{frequent}} character on the show. <b>She</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> a hoarse voice and often reported [...] "News for the Jews that You Can Use." [...] Her husband was in a coma, and she frequently worried about the constant change in ethnic groups in her neighborhood.|$|E
2500|$|Wherever she went, she was {{received}} enthusiastically, especially {{by the young}} people of America. [...] They loved this white-haired lady with {{the eyes of a}} seer that appeared to be lighted from within. [...] <b>She</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> a melodious voice; when she spoke everyone listened. [...] She had a thin, wispy quality that made her appear as the apparition of the very spirits she described. [...] Indeed, her skin had an almost translucent quality.|$|E
6000|$|She was charge {{with being}} so {{stubborn}} in {{clinging to her}} male dress {{that she would not}} lay it off even to get the blessed privilege of hearing mass. <b>She</b> <b>spoke</b> out <b>with</b> spirit and said: ...|$|R
6000|$|So far <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> loudly, <b>With</b> {{her face}} raised, {{and her eyes}} fixed upon him. Then as she concluded, she dropped her voice and eyes together. [...] "And I am now engaged to him as his wife." ...|$|R

2500|$|Blaming Gopichand, {{the chief}} {{national}} coach, for [...] "not supporting her" [...] in the fiasco, Gutta said {{she tried to}} resolve the issue by talking to everyone in the administration even before the show cause notice was issued. <b>She</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> the press saying, [...] "I love to play [...] No one on this earth can stop me from playing. In fact, no one should stop anyone from playing. I never thought that they [...] would stoop down to this level." ...|$|E
2500|$|Representative Miller {{told the}} Investigative Subcommittee {{that the first}} time she spoke to Representative Smith about his vote on the Medicare {{legislation}} was on the House floor while the vote was open, after Representative Smith had cast his vote. She estimated that <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> him during the first hour of the time that the vote was held open. Representative Miller saw Representative Smith's no vote on the board and she [...] "didn't like the way that he voted." [...] Representative Miller testified that, on her own initiative, she approached Representative Smith and said words to the effect of: [...] "Is this how you're going to vote; or, This is how you're going to vote? And he said, Obviously." ...|$|E
2500|$|Allen {{returned}} to Melbourne in 1935, for eleven months. <b>She</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> many women's groups whilst in Australia, such as National Council of Women of Victoria and Australian Federation of University Women.

60|$|Though Faith <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> vexation, <b>she</b> also <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> feeling. Her dark eye swam in tears, and {{the color}} of her brown cheek deepened, until her {{companion}} saw new reasons to forget his discontent in sympathies, which, however obtuse they might be, were never entirely dormant.|$|R
60|$|She did think, evidently, {{and when}} <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> it was <b>with</b> a generous emotion, {{in which there}} was no trace of pique.|$|R
