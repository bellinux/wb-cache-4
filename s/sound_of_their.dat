5|$|As Rosy sleeps, Mary {{writes a}} {{confession}} explaining {{that she made}} the calls to force a reunion, knowing that Rosy would call on her for help. While she is writing, an intruder enters the apartment. The intruder is Frank (Milo Quesada), who strangles Mary. The <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> struggle awakens Rosy, and Frank realizes he murdered the wrong woman. Frank approaches Rosy's bed, but she seizes her knife and stabs Frank. Rosy drops the knife and breaks down in hysteria.|$|E
5|$|Black Cherry is {{the second}} studio album by English {{electronic}} music duo Goldfrapp, released on 23 April 2003 by Mute Records. It marked {{a departure from the}} ambient <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> debut album, Felt Mountain (2000), incorporating glam rock and synthpop music; inspirations were Spanish disco group Baccara and Swedish techno artist Håkan Lidbo. The album was met with positive reviews, with many critics complimenting its blend of retro and modern electropop music.|$|E
5|$|Machine Head {{increased}} {{the complexity and}} technicality in their sound for the next album, The Blackening, which partially changes the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> first 5 albums {{in favor of a}} more classic heavy metal and thrash metal oriented sound, with fully complex song structures and guitar riffs. Unto the Locust features heavier, faster and more complex riffs by both Robb Flynn and Phil Demmel, influenced by classical music, and supported by fast and complex drum patterns by Dave McClain. This is also the first Machine Head's record to include blast beats.|$|E
50|$|The album can be {{described}} as the band's most intimate effort, focusing on the delicate and naive pop <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> music.|$|R

5|$|Production {{was plagued}} with problems. Bad weather during the {{shooting}} {{was a constant}} source of trouble, and Hitchcock and the crew had an uneasy relationship with the locals. Hitchcock ordered the clearance of snow from a meadow and ordered the local volunteer fire brigade to blast it away, causing the roof of a nearby building to collapse. The mayor demanded compensation of one shilling, but Hitchcock gave the woman who owned the house two shillings to cover the repair work and the inconvenience. Hitchcock offended the locals by refusing to stay at the village inn, and when he was taken ill with altitude sickness, he blamed the sickness on his reaction to the guttural <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> accents.|$|E
5|$|At home, Homer {{finds the}} {{personalized}} bowling glove given to Marge by Jacques and realizes {{he may be}} losing her. It is not long until Bart realizes that Lisa's suspicions are proving to be true about their parents drifting apart and offers Homer some advice in keeping his mouth shut so it does not get worse. At work the next day, he cannot bring himself to eat the sandwich she made for him, {{saying that it is}} all he has left of her. Marge leaves for her meeting with Jacques, but finds herself reminded of lifetime commitment throughout the drive. She comes to a fork in the road, one way leading to the nuclear plant, the other to Jacques' apartment. After an agonized hesitation at the crux of the decision, she surprises Homer at the plant and kisses him warmly. An ecstatic Homer abandons his work post to carry Marge away in his arms. His co-workers want to know what to tell the boss. To the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> cheers, he says to say {{that they are going to}} the backseat of his car and will not be back for ten minutes.|$|E
5|$|Invisible Circles is {{the third}} studio album by Dutch symphonic metal band After Forever. It was {{released}} on 25 March 2004, by the small Dutch label Transmission Records. It is After Forever's first full-length album since the dismissal of guitarist and composer Mark Jansen, whose musical tastes had strongly influenced the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> first work Prison of Desire (2000) and their successful second offering Decipher (2001). In this work After Forever choose a new musical direction, mostly revolving around elements of progressive metal instead of the gothic and symphonic metal of previous albums. The creative process for Invisible Circles {{took more than a}} year and required the use of three recording studios in the Netherlands and Germany. A long tour to support the album brought the band to some of the most important European rock festivals and to Central and South America.|$|E

5|$|NWOBHM bands {{had been}} touring {{steadily}} in the United States, {{but had not}} yet received enough FM radio airplay there to make a significant impression on American charts. Def Leppard remedied that, releasing Pyromania {{at the beginning of}} 1983, an album with a more melodic and FM-friendly approach in comparison with the more aggressive <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> earlier music. The band's goal of reaching a wider international audience, which included many female fans, was attained completely in the US, where Pyromania peaked at No.2 on the Billboard 200 chart behind Michael Jackson's Thriller. Thanks to a string of hit singles and the heavy rotation of their music videos on the recently launched MTV, the album had sold more than six millions copies in the US by 1984 and made Def Leppard superstars. The overwhelming international success of Pyromania induced both American and British bands to follow Def Leppard's example, giving a decisive boost to the more commercial and melodic glam metal and heralding the end of the NWOBHM.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the game, players can use a wide variety of weapons, {{including}} plastic bags, baseball bats, crowbars and a variety of bladed items. Later in the game, firearms become available (which cannot be used for executions). Should players take damage, their health depletes; health can be restored through the use of painkillers, which are available throughout each scene. Players also have a stamina meter which depletes as they sprint, but automatically replenishes when remaining stationary. Manhunt also makes use of the PlayStation 2's optional USB Microphone and the Xbox Live microphone feature on the Xbox in their respective versions of the game. When such a device is connected, players can use the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own voice to distract in-game enemies. This adds an extra element to the stealth aspect of the game, as players must refrain from making noises such as coughing as these sounds too can attract the attention of any nearby hunters.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the music}} of Antis embraced many aspects of new wave, they {{developed}} a unique and original style and <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own. Despite this, one of the group's biggest ever hits was Zombiai, a reworked cover of Men at Work song Down Under. In their late period, Antis began experimenting with complicated and hard-to-grasp jazz-rock structures.|$|E

60|$|As {{they neared}} the locality, the young hunters looked to {{their weapons and}} then {{advanced}} with caution. The water, gurgling over the rocks, drowned the <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> advance, and so they came upon the mink without being discovered.|$|R
25|$|McCarrick {{left the}} band {{permanently}} in March 2004, {{and the band}} were now slimmed down to a permanent three piece again {{for the first time}} since 1995. Never Apologise Never Explain was released in September 2004 to an audience re-acquainted with the three-piece Therapy? and was reminiscent of the claustrophobic <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> earlier material.|$|E

However, bolas spiders will try and often succeed to catch any insect that is flying nearby, aided by their good eyesight. They also seem to detect prey by the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> approaching flight.|$|E
25|$|The group's next album, The Holy Bible, was {{released}} in August to critical acclaim, but sold poorly. The album displayed yet another musical and aesthetic change for the band, largely featuring army/navy uniforms. Musically, The Holy Bible marks a shift from the modern rock <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> first two albums, Generation Terrorists and Gold Against the Soul. In addition to the album's alternative rock sound the album incorporates various elements from other musical genres, such as hard rock, British punk, post-punk, new wave, industrial, art rock and gothic rock.|$|E
60|$|Because it was slow, Mr Pickering {{was obliged}} to follow his prey almost entirely by ear. It was easy at first, for {{they seemed to be}} hurrying on {{regardless}} of noise. Then unexpectedly the <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> passage ceased.|$|R

25|$|In late 1976, Strickland and Wilson {{returned}} to Athens {{in search of}} further employment. The two joined the B-52's when they, Wilson's sister Cindy, and Kate Pierson and Fred Schneider of local protest band The Sun-Donuts, formed the group in an impromptu musical practice session after sharing a tropical flaming volcano drink at a Chinese restaurant. They played their first concert in 1977 at a Valentine's Day party for friends. The band's quirky take on the new wave <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> era {{was a combination of}} dance and surf music set apart by the unusual guitar tunings used by Wilson.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there had}} long been {{important}} platform games on home computers, a second generation of platform games for computers appeared alongside {{the new wave of}} consoles. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Amiga was known as a stronger gaming platform than IBM-compatible PCs, thanks to its more powerful stock video hardware and sound hardware. The Atari ST was solidly supported as well. Games like Shadow of the Beast and Turrican showed that computer platform games could rival the graphics and <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> console contemporaries, and Prince of Persia featured an unprecedented level of animation.|$|E
25|$|Electronic body music {{combines}} {{elements of}} industrial music and electronic dance music. It {{first came to}} prominence in Belgium. The name was coined by Ralf Hütter of Kraftwerk in 1978 to explain the more physical <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> album The Man-Machine. The term was later used in its current sense by Belgian group Front 242 in 1984 to describe their EP No Comment, released in the same year. It denotes {{a certain type of}} danceable electronic music, a mixture of electropunk and industrial music. Other artists include Armageddon Dildos, Die Krupps, à;GRUMH..., A Split-Second, And One, Bigod 20, The Neon Judgement, and Attrition.|$|E
50|$|On 30 September 2014, Milo Greene {{announced}} that their sophomore album, Control {{would be released}} on 27 January 2015. The band described the new album's tone as {{a departure from the}} more folk-based <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> previous work, and instead more upbeat and percussive.|$|R
5000|$|The {{next few}} nights, {{in an attempt}} to {{recreate}} the incident, local pilots flew prop-planes over the city in a [...] "V" [...] formation, but the <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> engines were easily heard.

50|$|Clearly {{distinct}} from the <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> first album, Brûlensemble showcases a somewhat less juvenile approach, mixing new wave and 80's influences in the punk rock roots of Gazoline. The aid of famed composer Julien Mineau (Malajube, Fontarabie) as producer surely helped finding this new direction.|$|R
25|$|Following the {{exposure}} {{that came from}} A Walk to Remember, Switchfoot attracted attention from multiple record labels, and ultimately signed with Columbia Records/SonyBMG. Their major label debut, The Beautiful Letdown, under Columbia Records/Red Ink, represented the band's evolution from the predominantly lo-fi, indie rock <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> early albums, toward a more layered, synth-influenced sound that helped launch the band to mainstream popularity. This shift sonically {{could be attributed to}} the fact that the album was the first to include keyboardist Jerome Fontamillas, formerly of industrial bands Mortal and Fold Zandura. Fontamillas had been touring with Switchfoot since 2000, following the release of Learning to Breathe.|$|E
25|$|The blacking-warehouse was {{the last}} house on the {{left-hand}} side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs. It was a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats. Its wainscoted rooms, and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, and the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly before me, as if I were there again. The counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it, in which I was to sit and work. My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first {{with a piece of}} oil-paper, and then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round, until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary's shop. When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label, and then go on again with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down-stairs on similar wages. One of them came up, in a ragged apron and a paper cap, on the first Monday morning, to show me the trick of using the string and tying the knot. His name was Bob Fagin; and I took the liberty of using his name, long afterwards, in Oliver Twist.|$|E
