25|$|In 1907, Oklahoma entered statehood, {{fostering}} {{changes in}} the political atmosphere of the state. Up until this point, Oklahoma's Republican tendencies changed {{with the election of}} Oklahoma's first governor, the Democratic Charles N. Haskell. Since the inception of the university, different groups on campus were divided by religion. Early in the university's existence, many professors were Presbyterian, as was Boyd. Under pressure, Boyd eventually hired several Baptists and <b>Southern</b> <b>Methodists.</b> The Presbyterians and Baptists got along but the <b>Southern</b> <b>Methodists</b> conflicted with the administration. Two notable Methodists, Rev. Nathaniel Lee Linebaugh and Professor Ernest Taylor Bynum, were critics of Boyd and activists in Haskell's election campaign. When Haskell took office, he fired many of the Republicans at the university, including President Boyd.|$|R

5|$|In 1908, {{historian}} Herbert Eugene Bolton identified an area along Garcitas Creek, near Matagorda Bay, as {{the location}} of Fort St. Louis.

Five decades later, the University of Texas at Austin funded a partial excavation of Bolton's site, {{a part of the}} Keeran ranch. Although several thousand items were recovered, archaeologists could not accurately distinguish between French and Spanish artifacts of the 17th century, and no report on the findings was ever issued.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the Baptist faith, Methodists started coming to the Cacapon River Valley during {{the latter half of}} the 18th century. Methodist Episcopal Church circuit rider Francis Asbury traveled through the Capon Bridge area in 1781. In 1890, the <b>Southern</b> <b>Methodist</b> Episcopal Church established its presence in the Capon Bridge area under the leadership of G. O. Homan. According to Maxwell and Swisher, the Capon Bridge Methodist circuit consisted of the following places in 1897: Capon Bridge, North River Mills, Green Mound, Augusta, Sedan, Park's Hollow, Sandy Ridge, and Capon Chapel. Capon Chapel was not commonly used as a Baptist place of worship by the early 20th century, and developed into a permanent stop along the Capon Bridge Methodist circuit, which later grew to include Central Church at Loom and Bethel Church at Neals Run. In 1976, the circuit's pastor was Thomas Malcolm.|$|E

Even though the Tar Heels were undefeated and ranked number 1 in the nation, Kansas entered the game as a 3point favorite, mostly because playing in Kansas City was a virtual home game.|$|E
