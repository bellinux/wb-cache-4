Gas flows through the reactor at elevated pressure, and it is heated to a high temperature by fuel combustion.

40|$|Railway {{wheelset}} components {{exposed to}} braking loads and contact {{forces have been}} studied. The work has been performed in close cooperation with the Swedish wheelset manufacturer ABB SURA Traction AB, and it has resulted in one brake disc prototype and two different wheel prototypes. Theoretical and numerical investigations have been performed using analytical models and commercial FE-programs. The results are verified through full-scale laboratory and field experiments. An inertia dynamometer for testing of brake components (wheels, discs, pads) has been designed and constructed within the present project. A linear analytical model for calculating transient axisymmetric temperature distributions in finite hollow cylinders has been established. The model {{is used to calculate}} temperature histories during and after braking in a nonventilated solid steel disc and in a ventilated disc made of cast iron. The theoretical results agree reasonably well with the experimental results from dynamometer testing. The conclusion is that, under Swedish driving conditions, a forged solid steel disc may be a possible substitute for the more complicated and expensive ventilated disc. A railway wheel using flexible S-shaped steel spokes between hub and rim is suggested. The vertical dynamic behaviour of a two-axle freight car with such wheels is analyzed and compared to that of a freight car with standard solid wheels. Full-scale field experiments have been performed using wheels without and with wheelflats instrumented for measurement of transient vertical wheel/rail contact forces. Accelerations and strains in the track structure were measured in parallel. The location of the travelling instrumented wheelset in relation to the instrumented portion of the track was determined at each instant of time. Different train speeds and axle loads were tested. The flexible wheel was found to considerably reduce the impact loads {{in the presence of a}} wheelflat. In contrast to a standard <b>solid</b> <b>wheel,</b> no thermally induced residual stresses from block braking will occur in the rim of the flexible wheel. The wheel was also found to radiate less noise than a <b>solid</b> <b>wheel.</b> Calculated temperatures and deformations are verified through experiments on the inertia dynamometer. The performance of a so-called low stress wheel with hub-rim offset is investigated. By use of a two-level fractional factorial design, the influences of six selected geometrical variables (describing disc thickness, rim thickness, and hub-rim offset) are quantified. It is found that a low stress wheel offers high resistance to thermal and mechanical loads. Based on the present study, a first set of twelve forged rim-quenched low stress wheels has been produced. Brake tests have been performed and field testing is underway...|$|E
40|$|For {{many years}} {{the problem of}} noise {{generated}} by trains has had an increasing importance; in this paper, {{attention is focused on}} the noise generated by the train wheels due to their vibration.

If the traditional and well known <b>solid</b> <b>wheel</b> is considered, a lot of data is already present in the literature both concerning the vibration and the noise point of view. On the other hand, the widely used resilient wheels are not so well known in their vibratory and acoustic behaviour {{as in the case of}} solid ones. The extensive experimentation presented and commented in this paper looks for a confirmation of some literature data first, and then it gives new results. Particularly the vibro-acoustic characterization of different kinds of wheels (both solid and resilient ones) has been carried out, in order to have a comparison between the behaviour of the newly built wheels and the older ones, representing the state of the art. Besides it has been shown that a detailed modal analysis of the suspended wheel coupled to sound measurements can give useful information about the wheel noise emission in its normal operating conditions...|$|E

Modeling {{has been done to}} estimate variation of air pressure within this boundary layer. Out of three different methods of extrapolation done, the most suitable one is suggested. Results obtained using three different wheels are compared. A scraper board is also employed to observe reduction of air pressure.

40|$|Chemical-looping {{combustion}} (CLC) is a {{novel and}} promising option for several applications including carbon capture (CC), fuel reforming, H 2 generation, etc. Previous studies demonstrated the feasibility of performing CLC in a novel rotary design with micro-channel structures. In the reactor, a <b>solid</b> <b>wheel</b> rotates between the fuel and air streams at the reactor inlet, and depleted air and product streams at exit. The rotary wheel consists {{of a large number}} of micro-channels with oxygen carriers (OC) coated on the inner surface of the channel walls. In the CC application, the OC oxidizes the fuel while the channel is in the fuel zone to generate undiluted CO 2, and is regenerated while the channel is in the air zone. In this two-part series, the effect of the reactor design parameters is evaluated and its performance with different OCs is compared. In Part 1, the design objectives and criteria are specified and the key parameters controlling the reactor performance are identified. The fundamental effects of the OC characteristics, the design parameters, and the operating conditions are studied. The design procedures are presented on the basis of the relative importance of each parameter, enabling a systematic methodology of selecting the design parameters and the operating conditions with different OCs. Part 2 presents the application of the methodology to the designs with the three commonly used OCs, i. e., nickel, copper, and iron, and compares the simulated performances of the designs. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{modeling}} of thermal effects {{has become increasingly}} important in product design in different transport means, road vehicles, airplanes, railway vehicles, and so forth. The thermal analysis {{is a very important}} stage in the study of braking systems, especially of railway vehicles, where it is necessary to brake huge masses, because the thermal load of a braked railway wheel prevails compared to other types of loads. In the braking phase, kinetic energy transforms into thermal energy resulting in intense heating and high temperature states of railway wheels. Thus induced thermal loads determine thermomechanical behavior of the structure of railway wheels. In cases of thermal overloads, which mainly occur as a result of long-term braking on down-grade railroads, the generation of stresses and deformations occurs, whose consequences are the appearance of cracks on the rim of a wheel and the final total wheel defect. The importance to precisely determine the temperature distribution caused by the transfer process of the heat generated during braking due to the friction on contact surfaces of the braking system makes it a challenging research task. Therefore, the thermal analysis of a block-braked solid railway wheel of a 444 class locomotive of the national railway operator Serbian Railways is processed in detail in this paper, using analytical and numerical {{modeling of}} thermal effects during long-term braking for maintaining a constant speed on a down-grade railroad.

40|$|Part 1 (10. 1021 /ef 3014103) of {{this series}} {{describes}} a new rotary reactor for gas-fueled chemical-looping combustion (CLC), in which, a <b>solid</b> <b>wheel</b> with microchannels rotates between the reducing and oxidizing streams. The oxygen carrier (OC) coated on the surfaces of the channels periodically adsorbs oxygen from air and releases it to oxidize the fuel. A one-dimensional model is also developed in part 1 (10. 1021 /ef 3014103). This paper presents the simulation results based on the base-case design parameters. The results indicate that both the fuel conversion efficiency and the carbon separation efficiency are close to unity. Because of the relatively low reduction rate of copper oxide, fuel conversion occurs gradually from the inlet to the exit. A total of 99. 9 % of the fuel is converted within 75 % of the channel, leading to 25 % redundant length near the exit, to ensure robustness. In the air sector, the OC is rapidly regenerated while consuming {{a large amount of}} oxygen from air. Velocity fluctuations are observed during the transition between sectors because of the complete reactions of OCs. The gas temperature increases monotonically from 823 to 1315 K, which is mainly determined by the solid temperature, whose variations with time are limited within 20 K. The overall energy in the solid phase is balanced between the reaction heat release, conduction, and convective cooling. In the sensitivity analysis, important input parameters are identified and varied around their base-case values. The resulting changes in the model-predicted performance revealed that the most important parameters are the reduction kinetics, the operating pressure, and the feed stream temperatures. © 2012 American Chemical Society...|$|E
