50|$|In 1988, AT&T {{released}} <b>StarLAN</b> 10, which operated at 10 Mbit/s. The original <b>StarLAN</b> {{was renamed}} to <b>StarLAN</b> 1, reflecting its speed of 1 Mbit/s.|$|E
50|$|<b>StarLAN</b> 10 and SynOptics LattisNet {{provided}} {{the basis for}} the later 10 megabit per second standard 10BASE-T. The 10BASE-T task force was chaired by Pat Thaler, a member of the <b>StarLAN</b> task force. 10BASE-T used the basic signalling of <b>StarLAN</b> 10 and added link beat. Some network interface cards such as the 3Com 3C-523 could be used with either <b>StarLAN</b> 10 or 10BASE-T, by switching link beat on or off.|$|E
5000|$|In 1988 AT&T {{released}} <b>StarLAN</b> 10, {{named for}} working at 10 Mbit/s. [...] The <b>StarLAN</b> 10 signalling {{was used as}} the basis of 10BASE-T, with the addition of [...] "link beat" [...] to quickly indicate connection status. (A number of network interface cards at the time could work with either <b>StarLAN</b> 10 or 10BASE-T, by switching link beat on or off.) ...|$|E
50|$|<b>StarLAN</b> was {{the first}} IEEE 802.3 {{standard}} for Ethernet over twisted pair wiring. It was standardized by the standards association of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) as 802.3e in 1986, as the 1BASE5 version of Ethernet. The <b>StarLAN</b> Task Force was chaired by Bob Galin.|$|E
5000|$|<b>StarLAN</b> - 1 MB/s {{local area}} network {{typically}} used in star format.|$|E
50|$|An early {{version of}} <b>StarLAN</b> was {{developed}} by Tim Rock and Bill Aranguren at AT&T Information Systems as an experimental system in 1983.The name <b>StarLAN</b> was coined by the IEEE task force {{based on the fact}} that it used a star topology from a central hub in contrast to the bus network of the shared cable 10BASE5 and 10BASE2 networks that had been based on ALOHANET.|$|E
50|$|The wire {{positioning}} called T568B in {{the standard}} TIA/EIA-568 was originally devised for <b>StarLAN,</b> and pair 1 (blue) was left unused to accommodate an analog phone pair. Pairs 2 and 3 (orange and green) carry the <b>StarLAN</b> signals. This greatly simplified the installation of combined voice and data wiring in countries that used registered jack connectors and American wiring practices for their phone service (connecting both to the same cable was {{a simple matter of}} using a pin-pin RJ45 splitter or punching down the same wires to two ports). This arrangement prevented harm to private branch exchange (PBX) equipment in the event that a <b>StarLAN</b> cable was plugged into the wrong device.|$|E
5000|$|Network Type for interfaces: IEEE 802.3 MAC, IEEE 802.4 MAC, IEEE 802.5 MAC, Ethernet, ProNET-80, ProNET-10, FDDI, X.25, Point-to-Point Serial, RPA 1822 HDH, ARPA 1822, AppleTalk, <b>StarLAN</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Parts of the <b>StarLAN</b> {{technology}} was patented by AT&T, and initially {{was part of}} a wider vision from AT&T, where it would link their UNIX-based AT&T 3B2 minicomputers to a network of MS-DOS PCs.|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "LANStar" [...] {{was coined}} by NT Product Marketing manager Paul Masters: he heard of AT&T's {{proposed}} <b>StarLAN</b> product {{and created a}} similar name in order to piggyback on all the publicity surrounding AT&T's product.|$|E
50|$|A major design goal in <b>StarLAN</b> was {{reduction}} in Ethernet installation costs by the reuse of existing telephone on-premises wiring and compatibility with analog and digital telephone signals {{in the same}} cable bundle. The signal modulation and wire pairing used by <b>StarLAN</b> were carefully chosen {{so that they would}} not affect or be affected by either the analog signal of a normal call, on hook and off hook transients, or the 20 Hz high-voltage analog ring signal. Reuse of existing wires was critical in many buildings where rewiring was cost prohibitive, where running new wire would disturb asbestos within the building infrastructure, and where the bus topology of coaxial bus Ethernet was not installable.|$|E
50|$|Early Ethernet {{had used}} various grades of coaxial cable, but in 1984, <b>StarLAN</b> showed the {{potential}} of simple unshielded twisted pair. This {{led to the development}} of 10BASE-T and its successors 100BASE-TX and 1000BASE-T, supporting speeds of 10, 100 and 1,000 Mbit/s respectively.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} {{known as}} 1BASE5 was adopted as 802.3e in 1986 {{by members of}} the IEEE 802.3 standards committee as the Twisted Pair Medium Access Control sublayer and Physical Signalling sublayer specification in section 12.The original <b>StarLAN</b> ran at a speed of 1 Mbit/s.|$|E
50|$|UB marketed a {{broadband}} (in {{the original}} technical sense) version of Ethernet known as 10BROAD36 {{in the mid}} 1980s. It was generally seen as hard to install. UB {{was one of the}} first network manufacturers to sell equipment that implemented Ethernet over twisted pair wiring. UB's AccessOne product line initially used the pre-standard <b>StarLAN</b> and, when it became standard, 10BASE-T.|$|E
50|$|Before {{the final}} {{standard}} {{version of what}} is known today as the 10BASE-T protocol, there were several different methods and standards for running Ethernet over twisted-pair cabling at various speeds, such as <b>StarLAN.</b> LattisNet was similar to the final 10BASE-T protocol except that it had slightly different voltage and signal characteristics. Synoptics updated their product line to the 10BASE-T specification once it was published.|$|E
50|$|The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) {{standards}} association ratified several {{versions of}} the technology. The first two early designs were <b>StarLAN,</b> standardized in 1986, at one megabit per second,and LattisNet, developed in January 1987, at 10 megabit per second.Both were developed before the 10BASE-T standard (published in 1990 as IEEE 802.3i) and used different signalling, so they were not directly compatible with it.|$|E
50|$|The Ethernet {{physical}} layer evolved over a considerable time span and encompasses coaxial, twisted pair and fiber-optic physical media interfaces, with speeds from 10 Mbit/s to 100 Gbit/s, with 400 Gbit/s expected by 2018. The first introduction of twisted-pair CSMA/CD was <b>StarLAN,</b> standardized as 802.3 1BASE5; while 1BASE5 had little market penetration, it defined the physical apparatus (wire, plug/jack, pin-out, and wiring plan) {{that would be}} carried over to 10BASE-T.|$|E
5000|$|Early LAN cabling had {{generally}} {{been based on}} various grades of coaxial cable. Shielded twisted pair was used in IBM's Token Ring LAN implementation, but in 1984, <b>StarLAN</b> showed the potential of simple unshielded twisted pair by using Cat3 cable - the same simple cable used for telephone systems. This {{led to the development}} of 10BASE-T (and its successors) and structured cabling which is still the basis of most commercial LANs today.|$|E
50|$|Ethernet on {{unshielded}} twisted-pair cables (UTP) {{began with}} <b>StarLAN</b> at 1 Mbit/s in the mid-1980s. In 1987 SynOptics introduced the first twisted-pair Ethernet at 10 Mbit/s in a star-wired cabling topology {{with a central}} hub, later called LattisNet. These evolved into 10BASE-T, which was designed for point-to-point links only, and all termination was built into the device. This changed repeaters from a specialist device used {{at the center of}} large networks to a device that every twisted pair-based network with more than two machines had to use. The tree structure that resulted from this made Ethernet networks easier to maintain by preventing most faults with one peer or its associated cable from affecting other devices on the network.|$|E
5000|$|Much of the mid-to-late 1980s saw {{an effort}} by WDC to use the profits from their ATA storage {{controllers}} to become a general-purpose OEM hardware supplier for the PC industry. As a result, WDC purchased a number of hardware companies. These included graphics cards (through its Paradise subsidiary, purchased 1986, which became Western Digital Imaging), core logic chipsets (by purchasing Faraday Electronics Inc. in 1987), SCSI controller chips for disk and tape devices (by purchasing ADSI in 1986), networking (WD8003, WD8013 Ethernet and WD8003S <b>StarLAN).</b> They did well (especially Paradise, which produced {{one of the best}} VGA cards of the era), but storage-related chips and disk controllers were their biggest money makers. In 1986, they introduced the WD33C93 single-chip SCSI interface, which was used in the first 16-bit bus mastering SCSI host adapter, the WD7000 [...] "FASST"; in 1987 they introduced the WD37C65, a single-chip implementation of the PC/AT's floppy disk controller circuitry, and the grandfather of modern super I/O chips; in 1988 they introduced the WD42C22 [...] "Vanilla", the first single-chip ATA hard disk controller.|$|E
40|$|Simulation {{models for}} LANs {{to be used}} in the {{proposed}} Space Station Training Facility, including models developed for Ethernet, <b>Starlan,</b> token ring, and Fiber Distributed Data Interface LANs, are discussed. Results of model runs for the basic configuration, for burst traffic, and for a growth scenario are presented. The PAWS and Network II. 5 modeling tools are compared...|$|E
40|$|The UltraNet is a {{high speed}} network capable of rates up to one gigabit per second. It is a hub based network with four optical fiber links {{connecting}} each hub. Each link can carry up to 256 megabits of data, and the hub backplane is capable of one gigabit aggregate throughput. Host connections to the hub may be fiber, coax, or channel based. Bus based machines have adapter boards that connect to transceivers in the hub, while channel based machines use a personality module in the hub. One way that the UltraNet achieves its high transfer rates is by off-loading the protocol processing from the hosts to special purpose protocol engines in the UltraNet hubs. In addition, every hub has a PC connected to it by <b>StarLAN</b> for network management purposes. Although there is hub resident and PC resident UltraNet software, this document treats only the host resident UltraNet software...|$|E
40|$|This work {{relates the}} OSI {{model and the}} Pseudo-Star LAN, {{defining}} a fast and flexible protocol architecture. A new concept to access the Pseudo-Star LAN is introduced, based on {{the definition of a}} genetic access interface (IAPE) and specialized access processors (PAPE). The protocols proposed to access the Pseudo-Star are the IEEE 802. 3; a PAPE implementing the 1 BASE 5 option (<b>Starlan)</b> was built. The heavy structure of the OSI model is an obstacle to fast aplications. This, and the high speed of the Pseudo-Star LAN led us to propose a simplified model, only with layers 1, 2 and 7, more suitable for fast aplications. A very simple file server was built, in order to study the functionality of such a simplified model. The lack of some layers does not affect the system functionality, and does not introduce too much overhead in the aplication layer. To overcome the lack of error control mechanisms in the simplified model, a method capable of adapting the block size is proposed and simulated, so that the communications system shows the best throughput for every bit error rateAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.
