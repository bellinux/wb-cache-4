Mulder reveals that Detective Thomas was killed, which shocks Skinner. Mulder tells Skinner that Scully is {{undergoing}} tests regarding her cancer. Later that night Skinner meets with The Smoking Man, who is accompanied by Thomas' murderer, the Gray Haired Man (Morris Panych). Skinner is angry that Thomas was killed and wants to end their arrangement, which The Smoking Man refuses to allow. Mulder calls Skinner, telling him about the woman's body being burned and the blood evidence being tampered with. Mulder tells Skinner that he is trying to match the bullet that killed Thomas to a gun issued to a federal agent or local officer. Skinner searches his drawer and realizes that his gun was missing and must have been the one used for the murder. Skinner, realizing he has been set up, calls The Smoking Man, who confirms that Thomas was killed with Skinner's gun and that by going to the police Skinner would end up implicating himself in the murder. The Smoking Man refuses to provide any details on what he is covering up.|$|E

In her planner that she leaves behind, Tender reads that <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to hijack the plane and crash it into the Australian outback. [...] Following Fertility to the airport, Tender finds her, takes Adam's gun (which she has stashed in an urn purportedly {{containing}} her brother's cremated remains), and uses it to board the plane. He then begins searching for the [...] "real" [...] hijacker until the joke dawns on him and he realizes {{that he is the}} hijacker. The plot thus returns to the beginning, with Tender telling his life story. He mentions that Fertility told him there was a way for him to escape the plane before it crashes, but on the record, he can't seem to figure it out. [...] The book ends mid-sentence, but without any definitive answer as to whether Tender lives or dies.

2500|$|Raggett {{described}} [...] "Pressure's On" [...] as {{a cousin}} to Laids opening song [...] "Out to Get You" [...] {{that could have}} [...] "easily fit" [...] on that album. It features a [...] "weirdly hypnotic synthesizer, the surreal, breathy vocals and the only occasionally comprehensible lyrics [...] to create a liquid, seductive, trippy sound." [...] "Jam J" [...] was compared to U2's Zooropa by Joyelle H. McSweeney of The Harvard Crimson, who noted the song contains [...] "driving rhythms, snarly lyrics obscured by feedback, and angry bursts of guitars breaking through the mess." [...] "Frequency Dip" [...] is said by one reviewer to recall U2's Zooropa and [...] "moves along with a throbbing bass loop and is thick on the drums. The vocals jump around in the song so much, {{it is as if}} <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> crazy with the crossfader." [...] "Burn the Cat" [...] is a slow, minimalistic song with only minute guitar chords, drum beats and various snippets of vocals drifting {{in and out of the}} song. [...] "Tomorrow" [...] features a [...] "rather attackling" [...] drum line and interwinding guitar strum and vocals. [...] "Gospel Oak," [...] relies heavily on harpsichord-like synthesiser, with disorienting results.|$|E
2500|$|The novel {{received}} some critical comments as well. The Oregonian's reviewer thought the characters were too [...] "extreme," [...] {{felt that the}} narrative took too long to get going, and concluded that Shed's method of communicating in sentence fragments (often missing a verb or subject) difficult to comprehend. Nevertheless, while these elements were [...] "irritating", the reviewer concluded: [...] "he exasperation is worth it: There is something triumphant about a novelist who risks this much and manages {{to find his way}} home." [...] The same reviewer also found that some passages might make some readers queasy: [...] "Spanbauer's book, his second novel, is not for the squeamish (or Mormons without a sense of humor). The descriptions of love-making and violence done to the flesh are pretty graphic. Shed is a clear-eyed, unflinching observer, after all; and if <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to have her legs amputated, Shed is going to report the dismembering in detail. That makes sense in terms of the character, but it can be heavy going for the sensitive." [...] The Los Angeles Times critic noticed a resemblance between Spanbauer's novel and other novels from several years earlier which attempted to shock with sex and violence, and wondered whether the novel was [...] "irresponsible" [...] in the age of AIDS.|$|E

What we were really excited about is if you built the show like something like The Office, where you essentially met all these characters and you loved them, and then how terrifying {{it would be if}} Sydney Bristow or Jack Bauersuddenly came into The Office, because you knew, when those people showed up, that <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to get shot, and <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to get tortured, and <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to get killed. That's where the initial germ of the Chuck show came from. — Co-creator Chris Fedak Josh Schwartz and Chris Fedak wrote the script for the first episode, which was initially given a put pilot commitment by NBC before a pilot order was green lit by the network in January 2007. Schwartz and Fedak both attended the University of Southern California. Fedak pitched the idea to Schwartz, who agreed to develop the project with him. Joseph McGinty Nichol, Schwartz's fellow executive producer on The O.C., directed the first hour of the series and consequently became an executive producer via his production company, Wonderland Sound and Vision. Fedak, Peter Johnson, Scott Rosenbaum, Matthew Miller, and Allison Adler also serve as co-executive producers. NBC gave the series an early pick-up and a thirteen-episode order on May 10, 2007. On November 26, 2007, TV Guide reported that NBC had picked up the series for a full, 22 episode season.|$|R

In November 1998, the BBC announced that Patsy Palmer had decided to leave EastEnders {{to spend more time with}} her family. The BBC said that Bianca would not be killed off, and a spokesman commented: [...] "Bianca has always been an amazingly powerful character and the door is open to her if she wants to return in the future. She has been fantastic in the years she has been in EastEnders and we will miss her." [...] Palmer was one of several high-profile EastEnders stars to announce their departures that year; McCutcheon and Kemp also decided to leave, and Gillian Taylforth left the serial in 1998 after 13 years playing Kathy Beale. The BBC said, [...] "no-one is bigger than the show, which is doing extremely well at the moment. We will send her off with all our very best wishes." [...] Richard Stokes, EastEnders series editor and producer of Palmer's exit storyline commented, [...] "you don't expect people to stay here for ever. But it's a double-edged sword. Yes, it's a shame when a well-loved character announces they're going, but the flipside is that it provides us with the space to do the best possible story.
