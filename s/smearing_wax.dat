5000|$|In {{order to}} stop the havoc and devastation, the gods seek Telipinu but fail to find him. Hannahannah, the mother goddess, sent a bee to find him; when the bee did, {{stinging}} Telipinu and <b>smearing</b> <b>wax</b> on him, the god grew angry and began to wreak destruction on the world. Finally, Kamrušepa, goddess of magic, calmed Telipinu by giving his anger to the Doorkeeper of the Underworld.|$|E
40|$|In 2 ̆ 2 Batiks and How to Make Them, 2 ̆ 2 Pieter Mijer says, 2 ̆ 2 Batik {{is the art}} of dyeing fabrics in {{one piece}} in {{different}} dyes consecutively, through the combination of which the pattern of the design is produced. 2 ̆ 2 Batik is not merely a crude method of decorating material as many people think it to be; it {{is not a matter of}} <b>smearing</b> <b>wax</b> on a piece of material with a brush, and then dipping It haphazard into any kind of dye. On the contrary, it is a craft which requires quite a good deal of skill and knowledge o! design, as well as a good ideal of color...|$|E
50|$|In Hittite mythology, {{the god of}} agriculture, Telipinu, went on a rampage {{and refused}} to allow {{anything}} to grow and animals would not produce offspring. The gods {{went in search of}} Telipinu only to fail. Then the goddess Hannahannah sent forth a bee to bring him back. The bee finds Telipinu, stings him and <b>smears</b> <b>wax</b> upon him. The god grew even angrier, until the goddess Kamrusepa (or a mortal priest according to some references) used a ritual to send his anger to the Underworld.|$|R

60|$|Waxed Paper is an {{excellent}} substitute for tin-foil, for excluding the air and damp from parcels. It is made by spreading a sheet of writing paper on a hot plate or stone and <b>smearing</b> it with <b>wax.</b> A hot flat-iron is convenient for making it.|$|R
40|$|This work {{introduces}} a rapid and effective technique for the discrimination of <b>smears</b> of coloured <b>wax</b> based products (such as lipstick and shoe polish) on fabrics. Forty two samples of commonly available wax based products were analysed. The analytical techniques used were {{a combination of}} thin layer chromatography (TLC) and direct microspectrophotometry (MSP) of the subsequent TLC plate. The resultant data was analysed using Self Organising Feature Mapping, an Artificial Neural Network system. The combination of both TLC and MSP facilitated the discrimination of all samples and the SOFM system provided an easy to understand visual representation of the sample discrimination by type...|$|R
40|$|Papyrus was {{the most}} {{important}} writing material in ancient times. Before papyrus tablets which made of pats and pans, plain stones, cushion, bronz, zinc, cuppor, silver or gold were used to write on. Besides these, writing materials which were made of plant roots and leaves, wooden tablets which were <b>smeared</b> with <b>wax,</b> tablets made of ivory and organic writing materials made of flax stem were used, too. However, none of these were essentials, influential or permanent like papyrus. Papyrus was first used in Ancient Egypt in 3300 s BC. Later, spreading over all Mediterranean countries, it became the most popular writing material. Papyrus remained valuable until XI century AD. Papyrus existed in several kind, different colour and several type of quality according to its whiteness, thickness, dimensionand polish. Papyrus used to be sold in different prices according to its praperties such as its lenght, quality etc. Papyrus was called in various names according to its thickness, width, colour and usage. These names reflected papyrus’s quality and price. They also reflected the area they were used. On the papyrus, scientific and literary articles such as mathematical calculations, astronomy, medical texts, magical words, religions texts, lists of kings, list of geographical places, list of cities, course boooks, mytological writings, adventure stories and articles of geography were written. Written papyrus was kept and transferred rolled in boxes and leather cases...|$|R
60|$|The rising sun, as he {{came through}} the little panes of the windows, etched a picture of that room into my brain. I can see the twisted candles with their <b>wax</b> <b>smearing</b> the sticks, the chairs awry, the tables {{littered}} with blackened pipes, and bottles, and spilled wine and tobacco among the dice; and the few that were left of my companions, some with dark lines under their eyes, all pale, but all gay, unconcerned, witty, and cynical; smoothing their ruffles, and brushing the ashes and snuff from the pattern of their waistcoats. As we went downstairs, singing a song Mr. Foote had put upon the stage that week, they were good enough to declare that I should never be permitted {{to go back to}} Maryland. That my grandfather should buy me a certain borough, which might be had for six thousand pounds.|$|R
40|$|Mangosteen can {{be stored}} for a {{relatively}} long period in low temperature storage, but peel hardening due to lostof moisture {{makes it difficult to}} open before consumption. One attempt to solve this problem is the application ofsemi-cutting treatment before storage of the fruits at low temperature. However, semi-cutting will acceleratedeterioration process since it increases fruit respiration and creates a door to microorganism to enter and spoil thefruit. Waxing the fruit after semi-cutting helps to overcome the problems, so the fruit {{can be stored}} at lowtemperature for long period, but it can be opened easily before consumption. This research aims to find a suitablemethod of waxing as well as the best wax concentration solution for waxing process. The methods of waxingconducted in this research were dipping and <b>smearing,</b> while the <b>wax</b> concentration in solution for both methodswere 6, 9, and 12 %. The results show that smearing the fruit after semi-cutting with 12 % wax concentration gave thelongest self life for the mangosteen stored at low temperature, while the fruits were still easier to open afterstorage...|$|R
60|$|The men had {{all laughed}} at the proposal, but willingly consented to part with {{a portion of their}} hair. Meinik {{therefore}} proceeded to stain Stanley's close crop black and, the first thing in the morning, the boys went out, soon returning with a quantity of berries. Some water was poured over them, in an earthenware pot, and placed over the fire and, in half an hour, a thick scum of oil gathered on the surface. Meinik skimmed it off, as fast as it formed and, as it cooled, it solidified into a tenacious mass, somewhat resembling cobblers' wax. The six locks of hair had already been cut off, and the ends were <b>smeared</b> with the <b>wax,</b> and worked in among Stanley's own hair; then a little of the hot wax was rubbed in, and the men all declared that no one would notice anything peculiar in his appearance. The long tresses were curled round, {{at the top of the}} head, and a ring of muslin tied round. The Burmans were immensely amused at the transformation that had been wrought in Stanley's appearance; and followed him through the wood, to the temple, without any signs of nervousness.|$|R
