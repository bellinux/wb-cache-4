50|$|A buckling-restrained brace (BRB) is a <b>structural</b> <b>brace</b> in a building, {{designed}} to allow the building to withstand cyclical lateral loadings, typically earthquake-induced loading. It consists of a slender steel core, a concrete casing {{designed to}} continuously support the core and prevent buckling under axial compression, and an interface region that prevents undesired interactions between the two. Braced frames that use BRBs - known as buckling-restrained braced frames, or BRBFs - have significant advantages over typical braced frames.|$|E

40|$|An Energy Dissipating Cladding System {{has been}} {{developed}} for use in buildings designed based {{on the concept of}} damage-controlled structure in seismic design. This innovative cladding panel system is capable of functioning both as a <b>structural</b> <b>brace,</b> as well as a source of energy dissipation, without demanding inelastic action and ductility from the basic lateral force resisting system. The structural systems of many modern buildings typically have large openings to accommodate glazing systems, and a popular type of construction uses spandrel precast cladding panels at each floor level that supports strip window systems. The present study focuses on developing spandrel type precast concrete cladding panels as supplementary energy dissipating devices that are added to the basic structural system. Through a series of analytical studies, the result of evaluating the ability of the proposed Energy Dissipating Cladding system to improve the earthquake resistance of the buildings is presented here...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of buildings in seismic zone is usually {{more complicated than}} that in non-seismic zone. The buildings are not only required damage-limited for fully operational after frequent earthquakes, but collapseprevented under rare earthquakes for life safety. Therefore, the buildings in seismic zone require the structure to bear proper stiffness and load-bearing capacity to resist frequent earthquakes, and possess proper ductility and energy-dissipating capacity to prevent collapse due to rare earthquakes as well. Structural metal damper is herein defined as a combination of structural member and energy-dissipating damper. It not only provides stiffness and strength to guarantee the operation of buildings under frequent earthquakes, but also dissipates energy to reduce seismic response to a considerable extent for the purpose of collapse-prevention. Three different structural metal dampers, including buckling-restrained brace (BRB), buckling-restrained steel plate shear wall (BRSW) and steel link elements, are introduced in this paper. BRB is not only a <b>structural</b> <b>brace,</b> but innovatively kept from buckling by using restrainers and its hysteretic curve is improved to be spindle-shape, ideal for dissipating energy to against seismic effects. BRSW is also ideal spindle-shape in hysteretic curve feature and can be used as an excellent structural metal damper. And in order to improve the {{performance of}} traditional shear walls and coupled shear walls under earthquakes, steel link elements are introduced. Finally, examples of using various structural metal dampers for buildings in seismic zone are presented...|$|E

40|$|High {{resolution}} holographic {{tests were}} carried out on DSS- 63 at S-band and K-band during May l 985. These tests followed a mechanical retrofit which involved the addition of <b>structural</b> <b>bracing</b> to the backing structure. Geosynchronous satellite beacons were used as sources for the tests. At a resolution of 0. 4 m the S-band and K-band tests revealed rms deviations of the surface to be 2. 73 mm and 1. 53 mm, respectively. The {{difference between these two}} results is thought to be due mainly to contamination of the S-band surface error map by expected and generally predictable subreflector diffraction effects. The S-band map is also known to be contaminated by diffraction from the subreflector support struts and has a higher noise level than the K-band map. A list of corrections to be applied to the reflector panels is derived from the K-band map. These corrections are predicted to reduce the rms deviation from 1. 53 mm to 0. 86 mm at 0. 4 m resolution. Comparison with results obtained before the mechanical retrofit suggests the major effect of the added <b>structural</b> <b>bracing</b> to be reduction of a third order deformation of the reflector about its axis...|$|R

40|$|The Australian Residential Timber-Framed Construction {{standard}} (AS 1684 : 1999) {{has recently}} been revised to explicitly define the bracing contribution of nominally fixed plasterboard clad walls as 0. 45 kN/m for cladding {{on one side and}} 0. 75 kN/m for cladding on two sides. These values clarify the allowance, which designers may rely upon for the presence of plasterboard and their inclusion in the standard infers a necessity for plasterboard products to at least meet these requirements. A review of the relevant Australian, ISO, and ASTM standards, as well as plasterboard manufacturers’ in-house quality control tests has established that these tests mainly focus on serviceability aspect of plasterboard (e. g., storage, transportation, and installation) rather than that of <b>structural</b> <b>bracing</b> performance. It has also been determined that there are no direct correlations between serviceability conditions and <b>structural</b> <b>bracing</b> performance of plasterboard. In fact, a limited set of data provided by the plasterboard manufacturers shows that almost no correlation exists between the current quality control tests and the most commonly measured parameter, the density of plasterboard. It has been concluded that current tests are inadequate to serve as control measures for bracing performance of plasterboard. Nonetheless, {{it must be noted that}} density is not the only parameter that may influence the bracing performance of plasterboard; other parameters such as linerboard strength and bonding between gypsum and linerboard may also affect the bracing capacity. This paper details a new test, termed fastener bearing test, which provides a method to evaluate the bracing capacity of plasterboard. The results of this test show a very high correlation with shear connection tests. The proposed test is practical and simple to perform as part of the manufacturing process, in addition to the current tests, without severe cost and time penalty to the plasterboard manufacturers...|$|R

Despite sharing functional and structural characteristics, the DsbA enzymes studied to date vary widely in their redox character. In this study we show that the truncated soluble form of the predicted membrane anchored protein C. trachomatis DsbA (CtDsbA) has oxidase activity and redox properties broadly similar to other characterized DsbA proteins. However CtDsbA is distinguished from other DsbAs by having six cysteines, including a second disulfide bond, and an unusual dipeptide sequence in its catalytic motif (Cys-Ser-Ala-Cys). We report the 2. 7 Å crystal structure of CtDsbA revealing a typical DsbA fold, which is most {{similar to that of}} DsbA-II type proteins. Consistent with this, the catalytic surface of CtDsbA is negatively charged and lacks the hydrophobic groove found in EcDsbA and DsbAs from other enterobacteriaceae. Biochemical characterization of CtDsbA reveals it to be weakly oxidizing compared to other DsbAs and with only a mildly destabilizing active site disulfide bond.

SC is categorized into eight types by its form (structural and cognitive) and function (birding, linking, and bracing). OLS is used for estimation on randomly selected 60 household data. As for self-rated health status, those attending more community activity (bonding structural SC) appear less healthy, seemingly that old farmers normally {{have more time to}} spend on community activities and they are more loyal to their organization. Those who highly evaluate bureaucratic organization (linking cognitive SC) are relatively healthier. Frequency of attending community activities (bonding structural SC) and duration of involvement in organization (birding structural SC)) contribute to higher rice yield. Farmers who have wider and longer relationships with organizations seem to perform better farming.

The bracing connections performed as intended; the gusset plates folded out of plane, and no crack was observed in the gusset plate or in the critical welds. Consequently, the test results demonstrated excellent performance of the bracing connections. Elastic deformation of the beam prevented the braces from developing their full tensile strength.

40|$|Metal foam is a {{relatively}} new and potentially revolutionary material that allows for components to be replaced with elements capable of large energy dissipation, or components to be stiffened with elements which will generate significant supplementary energy dissipation when buckling occurs. Metal foams provide a means to explore reconfiguring steel structures to mitigate cross-section buckling in many cases and dramatically increase energy dissipation in all cases. ^ The microstructure of metal foams consists of solid and void phases. These voids have random shape and size. Therefore, randomness, which is introduced into metal foams during the manufacturing processes, creating more uncertainty in the behavior of metal foams compared to solid steel. Therefore, studying uncertainty in the performance metrics of structures which have metal foams is more crucial than for conventional structures. Therefore, in this study, structural application of metal foams considering material and geometrical uncertainty is presented. ^ This study applies the Sobol’ decomposition of a function of many random variables to different problem in structural mechanics. First, the Sobol’ decomposition itself is reviewed and extended to cover the case in which the input random variables have Gaussian distribution. Then two examples are given for a polynomial function of 3 random variables and the collapse load of a two story frame. In the structural example, the Sobol’ decomposition is used to decompose the variance of the response, the collapse load, into contributions from the individual input variables. This decomposition reveals the relative importance of the individual member yield stresses in determining the collapse load of the frame. In applying the Sobol’ decomposition to this structural problem the following issues are addressed: calculation of the components of the Sobol’ decomposition by Monte Carlo simulation; the effect of input distribution on the Sobol’ decomposition; convergence of estimates of the Sobol’ decomposition with sample size using various sampling schemes; the possibility of model reduction guided by the results of the Sobol’ decomposition. ^ For the rest of the study the different structural applications of metal foam is investigated. In the first application, it is shown that metal foams have the potential to serve as hysteric dampers in the braces of braced building frames. Using metal foams in the <b>structural</b> <b>braces</b> decreases different dynamic responses such as roof drift, base shear and maximum moment in the columns. Optimum metal foam strengths are different for different earthquakes. In order to use metal foam in the <b>structural</b> <b>braces,</b> metal foams need to have stable cyclic response which might be achievable for metal foams with high relative density. ^ The second application is to improve strength and ductility of a steel tube by filling it with steel foam. Steel tube beams and columns are able to provide significant strength for structures. They have an efficient shape with large second moment of inertia which leads to light elements with high bending strength. Steel foams with high strength to weight ratio are used to fill the steel tube to improves its mechanical behavior. The linear eigenvalue and plastic collapse finite element (FE) analysis are performed on steel foam filled tube under pure compression and three point bending simulation. It is shown that foam improves the maximum strength and the ability of energy absorption of the steel tubes significantly. Different configurations with different volume of steel foam and composite behavior are investigated. It is demonstrated that there are some optimum configurations with more efficient behavior. If composite action between steel foam and steel increases, the strength of the element will improve due to the change of the failure mode from local buckling to yielding. ^ Moreover, the Sobol’ decomposition is used to investigate uncertainty in the strength and ductility of the composite tube, including the sensitivity of the strength to input parameters such as the foam density, tube wall thickness, steel properties etc. Monte Carlo simulation is performed on aluminum foam filled tubes under three point bending conditions. The simulation method is nonlinear finite element analysis. Results show that the steel foam properties have a greater effect on ductility of the steel foam filled tube than its strength. Moreover, flexural strength is more sensitive to steel properties than to aluminum foam properties. ^ Finally, the properties of hypothetical structural steel foam C-channels foamed are investigated via simulations. In thin-walled structural members, stability of the walls is the primary driver of structural limit states. Moreover, having a light weight {{is one of the main}} advantages of the thin-walled structural members. Therefore, thin-walled structural members made of steel foam exhibit improved strength while maintaining their low weight. Linear eigenvalue, finite strip method (FSM) and plastic collapse FE analysis is used to evaluate the strength and ductility of steel foam C-channels under uniform compression and bending. It is found that replacing steel walls of the C-channel with steel foam walls increases the local buckling resistance and decreases the global buckling resistance of the C-channel. ^ By using the Sobol’ decomposition, an optimum configuration for the variable density steel foam C-channel can be found. For high relative density, replacing solid steel of the lips and flange elements with steel foam increases the buckling strength. On the other hand, for low relative density replacing solid steel of the lips and flange elements with steel foam deceases the buckling strength. Moreover, it is shown that buckling strength of the steel foam C-channel is sensitive to the second order Sobol’ indices. ^ In summary, it is shown in this research that the metal foams have a great potential to improve different types of structural responses, and there are many promising application for metal foam in civil structures. ...|$|R
