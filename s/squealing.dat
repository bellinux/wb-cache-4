40|$|International audienceIn this paper, an {{experimental}} {{analysis performed on}} a simplified brake apparatus is presented. Brake <b>squeal</b> {{is a major concern}} in braking design. During past years a common approach for <b>squeal</b> prediction was the complex eigenvalues analysis. <b>Squeal</b> phenomenon is treated like a dynamic instability. When two modes of the brake system couple at the same frequency, one of them becomes unstable leading to increasing vibration. The presented experimental analysis is focused on correlating <b>squeal</b> characteristics with the dynamic behavior of the system. The experimental modal identification of the set-up is performed and different <b>squeal</b> conditions and frequencies are reproduced and analyzed. Particular attention is addressed to the system dynamics in function of the driving parameters on <b>squeal</b> occurrence. <b>Squeal</b> events are correlated with the modal behavior of the system in function of the main parameters, like contact pressure, friction material properties and system geometry. The robustness of the obtained <b>squeal</b> events permits a further analysis on the triggering of the <b>squeal</b> instability during braking, including the values of parameters that bring to instability. The obtained results agree with the modal coupling approach for <b>squeal</b> prediction, and confirm the characterization of <b>squeal</b> as dynamic instabilit...|$|R

25|$|To prevent scarring, it is {{prudent to}} {{periodically}} inspect the brake pads for wear. A tire rotation {{is a logical}} time for inspection, since rotation must be performed regularly based on vehicle operation time and all wheels must be removed, allowing ready visual access to the brake pads. Some types of alloy wheels and brake arrangements will provide enough open space to view the pads without removing the wheel. When practical, pads that are near the wear-out point should be replaced immediately, as complete wear out leads to scarring damage and unsafe braking. Many disc brake pads will include some sort of soft steel spring or drag tab {{as part of the}} pad assembly, which is designed to start dragging on the disc when the pad is nearly worn out. The result is a moderately loud metallic <b>squealing</b> noise, alerting the vehicle user that service is required, and this will not normally scar the disc if the brakes are serviced promptly. A set of pads can be considered for replacement if the thickness of the pad material is the same or less than the thickness of the backing steel. In Pennsylvania, the standard is 1/32".|$|E

40|$|A disc or {{drum brake}} system is very often {{generating}} undesirable and annoying <b>squeal</b> noise that can disturb both driver and passengers. In {{order to prevent}} or reduce brake <b>squeal</b> noise, structural modifications of brake components, damping layers and active <b>squeal</b> control methods are commonly proposed and evaluated by car manufacturers using analytical, numerical and experimental approach. Thus, this thesis attempts to investigate the effectiveness of damping layers such as pad insulator and clip to reduce disc brake <b>squeal</b> noise. In doing so, existing two (pad model) and four (pad-disc model) degrees-of-freedom (DOF) brake models without damping layers are adopted. The mass, stiffness and damping values of these brake models are obtained from the experiments. These two brake models are then validated against a real brake assembly test data and good correlation on the natural and <b>squeal</b> frequency is achieved. Upon obtaining validated brake models, damping layers i. e. the clip and insulator are modelled based on its mass, stiffness and damping. The layers later are embedded into the validated pad and pad-disc models. The parameter properties (stiffness and damping) of these damping layers are measured from modal testing. Complex eigenvalue (CE) and dynamic transient (DT) analyses are performed using MATLAB software package to predict <b>squeal</b> occurrences. The <b>squeal</b> trigger mechanism used in this work is based on mode coupling effect. The brake models with damping layers are simulated at a certain brake parameter range such as friction coefficient, pad-disc contact stiffness and pad wear. From the analysis, {{it is found that}} both CE and DT predict <b>squeal</b> frequency close to the measured data with difference less than 4 %. It is also found that the pad-disc model is successfully predicting <b>squeal</b> or non-squeal occurrences close to the <b>squeal</b> test results for both with clip and clip-insulator models. However, the pad model is seen not capable to completely replicate the <b>squeal</b> test results particularly with the clip model. This shows that the pad-disc model should be used to predict <b>squeal</b> occurrences. From the parametric studies, it is shown that <b>squeal</b> noise can b...|$|R

40|$|Curve <b>squeal</b> {{is a type}} of {{railway noise}} that may arise when a railway vehicle negotiates a {{relatively}} tight curve. A single frequency, corresponding to a wheel mode, dominates the radiated sound, which makes <b>squeal</b> a very tonal noise. The high number of tight curves in cities and urban areas, its tonal nature and high noise levels make <b>squeal</b> a significant source of noise pollution. The rising awareness of the impact of noise on public health increases the need to address the <b>squeal</b> problem. Consequently, there is an increased need for practical simulation tools. In this thesis, a computationally fast <b>squeal</b> model formulated in the time domain is proposed. The computational efficiency is achieved by modelling the tangential contact with a point-contact model, which considers the contact variables globally. The friction model and the contact compliance are defined in a rigorous manner using Kalker's variational theory. Validation results show that the contact model is valid up to at least 5 kHz. The proposed model is further extended to include the effects of spin creepage, contact angle and two-point wheel/rail contact. Spin creepage is treated as a contact property with its influence included in the friction model. Additionally, the model is also extended with an existing model for sound radiation from the railway wheel. Parameter studies show a strong influence of parameters that influence the dynamics coupling responsible for squeal: the contact angle, friction and the wheel/rail contact position. These parameters influence both <b>squeal</b> occurrence, amplitudes and frequency. Spin, however, influences only <b>squeal</b> amplitudes. With the wheel being a significant factor in curve <b>squeal,</b> the influence of the wheel modal damping is also investigated. To mitigate <b>squeal</b> in a specific case, all modes that are susceptible to <b>squeal</b> in that case have to be damped. Otherwise, <b>squeal</b> may shift to another mode and develop even higher amplitudes. The amount of modal damping required to prevent <b>squeal</b> is relatively low. Finally, a two-point wheel/rail contact case is analysed. Results show that <b>squeal</b> can occur on curve-outer wheels.

40|$|Curve <b>squeal</b> {{is a type}} of {{railway noise}} that may arise when a railway vehicle negotiates a {{relatively}} tight curve. <b>Squeal</b> is common in curves of a radius lower than 200 meters. A single frequency dominates the radiated sound, which makes <b>squeal</b> a very tonal noise. The high number of tight curves in cities and urban areas, the tonal nature and high noise levels, make <b>squeal</b> a serious source of noise pollution. The rising awareness of the impact of noise on public health increases the need to address the <b>squeal</b> problem. Consequently, {{there is a need for}} practical <b>squeal</b> simulation tools. The aim of this thesis is to develop a computationally fast <b>squeal</b> model in the time domain suitable for practical use. For this purpose, an existing <b>squeal</b> model is modified. The tangential contact is modelled using a point-contact model, which considers the contact variables in a global manner. This is in contrast to Kalker’s variational contact model which discretizes the contact area into elements. The friction model and contact compliance are defined in a stringent way in relation to Kalker’s model. In this way, the point-contact model is able to describe the transition of contact conditions from full stick to full slip. Although the proposed contact model is steady-state, it performs well at high frequencies. An upper limit of applicability of at least 5 kHz was found in the validation of the contact model within the <b>squeal</b> model. Compared to the classical validation with prescribed motion, the inclusion of the system dynamics puts different demands on the contact model. This indicates that contact models should be validated/compared in conditions that replicate their specific application as closely as possible. The engineering model is completed by implementing an existing model for sound radiation from the railway wheel, the implementation of which is validated against BEM results. A parameter study involving lateral creepage, wheel/rail contact position and friction is performed using the proposed <b>squeal</b> model. The investigated parameters show a strong influence on <b>squeal</b> occurrence and amplitudes. With the wheel being an important factor in <b>squeal,</b> the influence of the wheel modal damping is also investigated. Results indicate that increasing only the damping of the mode excited in <b>squeal</b> may not be sufficient. <b>Squeal</b> may then occur involving another mode with another frequency and amplitude.
