Dyer, {{head of the}} Fabric Section at Cardington, undertaken on 20 January 1930 revealed serious deterioration of the fabric {{on the top of}} the airship in areas where rainwater had accumulated, and a decision was made to add reinforcement bands along the whole length of the envelope. Further tests undertaken by Rope had shown that its strength had deteriorated alarmingly. The original <b>specified</b> <b>strength</b> for the cover was a breaking strain of 700 lb per foot run (10 kN/m): the actual strength of samples was at best 85 lb (1.24 kN/m). The calculated load at a speed of 76 mph was 143 lb per foot run (2.09 kN/m). A further inspection of the cover on 2 June found many small tears had developed. [...] An immediate decision was taken to replace the pre-doped cover with a new cover which would be doped after fitting. This would take place following the flights which had been planned for June with the purpose of displaying R101 to the public at the Hendon Air Show. For these flights the cover would be further reinforced. Confirmation of the poor state of the cover came on the morning of 23 June when R101 was walked out of the shed. It had been at the mast for less than an hour in a moderate wind when an alarming rippling movement was observed and shortly afterwards, a 140 ft tear appeared on the right-hand side of the airship. It was decided to repair these at the mast and to add more strengthening bands. This was done by the end of the day but the next day a second, shorter, split occurred. This was dealt with in the same way, and it was decided that if the reinforcing bands were added to the repaired area the scheduled appearance at the RAF pageant at Hendon could be made.|$|E

However, {{in contrast to the}} precast plant production of UHPC where a standard high-temperature steam curing is available, an optimum curing condition is rarely realized with cast-in-place UHPC. Therefore, the trend of the compressive strength development of UHPC was experimentally investigated in this study, with a focus on early-age strength by assuming the various curing conditions anticipated on site. Concrete specimens were cured under different conditions with variables including curing temperature, delay time before the initiation of curing, duration of curing, and moisture condition.

40|$|Modern {{construction}} techniques enable {{reinforced concrete}} structures to be constructed {{in a very}} short time. The loads occurring due to the construction process on the partially completed structure can be larger than the design service load. The available strength of the immature partially completed structure is dependent upon the available concrete strength which may be less than the <b>specified</b> <b>strength.</b> Failure would occur if the available strength is less than that required to support the construction loads. The construction loads can also cause significant immediate deflection due to concrete cracking and its low early age modulus of elasticity. Because of the high applied stress/developed strength ratio and shrinkage, the time dependent deflection may be unacceptably large. This thesis examines the early age behaviors of concrete tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, concrete shrinkage and creep, and develops prediction equations which are demonstrated to be more appropriate than the current code equations...|$|E
