5|$|Traditionally, the Galapagos {{sea lion}} and Japanese sea lion were {{classified}} as subspecies of the California sea lion. However, a genetic study in 2007 found that all three are in fact separate species. The lineages of the California and Japanese sea lion appear to have split off 2.2 million years ago during the Pliocene. The California sea lion differs from the Galapagos sea lion in its greater sexual dimorphism. The <b>Steller</b> sea lion is the closest extant relative of the Zalophus sea lions, being a sister taxon.|$|E
5|$|Bowie Seamount {{supports}} a biologically rich {{area with a}} vigorous ecosystem. Studies have recorded high densities of crab, sea stars, sea anemones, sponges, squid, octopus, rockfish, halibut and sablefish. Eight species of marine mammal {{have been found in}} the Bowie Seamount area, including <b>Steller</b> sea lions, orca, humpback and sperm whales, along with 16varieties of seabirds. This has made Bowie Seamount a rare habitat in the northeast Pacific Ocean {{and one of the most}} biologically rich submarine volcanoes on Earth. The rich marine life is due to the intense food supply of microscopic animals and plants, including phytoplankton and zooplankton.|$|E
50|$|<b>Stellers</b> sea cow was {{a member}} of the genus Hydrodamalis, a group of large sirenians, whose sister taxon was Dusisiren. Like those of <b>Stellers</b> sea cow, the {{ancestors}} of Dusisiren lived in tropical mangroves before adapting to the cold climates of the North Pacific. Hydrodamalis and Dusisiren are classified together in the subfamily Hydrodamalinae, which diverged from other sirenians around 4 to 8 mya. <b>Stellers</b> sea cow is a member of the family Dugongidae, whose sole surviving member, and thus <b>Stellers</b> sea cows closest living relative, is the dugong (Dugong dugon).|$|R

5|$|Interspecific {{predation}} among pinnipeds does occur. The {{leopard seal}} {{is known to}} prey on numerous other species, especially the crabeater seal. Leopard seals typically target crabeater pups, which form {{an important part of}} their diet from November to January. Older crabeater seals commonly bear scars from failed leopard seal attacks; a 1977 study found that 75% of a sample of 85 individual crabeaters had these scars. Walruses, despite being specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling invertebrates, occasionally prey on Arctic seals. They kill their prey with their long tusks and eat their blubber and skin. <b>Steller</b> sea lions have been recorded eating the pups of harbor seals, northern fur seals and California sea lions. New Zealand sea lions feed on pups of some fur seal species, and the South American sea lion may prey on South American fur seals.|$|E
5|$|Other {{marine mammal}} prey species include nearly 20 species of seal, sea lion and fur seal. Walruses and sea otters are less {{frequently}} taken. Often, to avoid injury, killer whales disable their prey before killing and eating it. This may involve throwing {{it in the}} air, slapping it with their tails, ramming it, or breaching and landing on it. Sea lions are killed by head-butting or after a stunning blow from a tail fluke. In the Aleutian Islands, a decline in sea otter populations in the 1990s was controversially attributed by some scientists to killer whale predation, although with no direct evidence. The decline of sea otters followed a decline in harbour seal and <b>Steller</b> sea lion populations, the killer whale's preferred prey, which in turn may be substitutes for their original prey, now decimated by industrial whaling.|$|E
5|$|Over 40 {{species of}} mammals have been documented, {{including}} the black bear, coyote, cougar, bobcat, beaver, river otter, black-tailed deer, and elk. Along the coastline, California sea lions, <b>Steller</b> sea lions and harbor seals {{live near the}} shore and on seastacks, rocky outcroppings forming small islands just off the coast. Dolphins and Pacific gray whales are occasionally seen offshore. Roosevelt elk are the most readily observed of the large mammals in the park. Successful herds, brought back from the verge of extinction in the region, are now a common site in park areas south of the Klamath River. Many smaller mammals live in the high forest canopy. Different species of bats, such as the big brown bat, and other smaller mammals including the red squirrel and northern flying squirrel {{spend most of their}} lives well above the forest floor.|$|E
50|$|Kleptoparasitism is {{sometimes}} recorded within the species. Occasionally, the smaller species may steal a fish {{away from the}} <b>Steller's,</b> especially if it is distracted by aggression from conspecifics, and both juvenile and adult <b>Steller's</b> may lose fish to the smaller species even face-to-face, especially a less assertive bird, such as immature <b>Steller's.</b> One video shows a golden eagle engaging an immature <b>Steller's</b> in a conflict and ultimately displacing it after maintaining a superior grip despite its smaller size. In other cases, the <b>Steller's</b> have been photographed coming away with the prey after using its superior size to dominate, usually by bearing down its mass and large bill over the smaller eagles. In other cases, though, the three eagle species have been observed to feed in close proximity and seem to be outwardly indifferent to each other's presence. In inland areas, where golden, bald and white-tailed eagles compete over food sources which are not as abundant as these fish and, more importantly, compete for nesting ranges, aggressive interspecies competition can be more common. White-tailed eagles and golden eagles have even killed one another in Scotland, in cases of competition for abutting nesting ranges. As in many sea and fish eagles, <b>Steller's</b> sea eagle may attempt to steal (and occasionally succeed in procuring) fish from osprey (Pandion haliaetus) where they coexist. In one case, a cinereous vulture (Aegypius monachus), the largest living accipitrid, was observed to be pursued in flight and kleptoparasitized by a <b>Steller's</b> sea eagle.|$|R
50|$|<b>Steller's</b> sea cow {{was quickly}} {{wiped out by}} fur traders, seal hunters, and others who {{followed}} Vitus Bering's route past the sea cow's habitat and to Alaska. It was also hunted to collect its valuable subcutaneous fat. By 1768, 27 years after it had been discovered by Europeans, <b>Steller's</b> sea cow was extinct. In 1887 Stejneger estimated {{that there had been}} fewer than 1,500 individuals remaining at the time of <b>Steller's</b> discovery, and thus there was already an immediate danger of the sea cow's extinction.|$|R

5|$|Killer {{whales are}} apex predators {{throughout}} their global distribution, and {{can have a}} profound effect on the behavior and population of prey species. Their diet is very broad and they can feed on many vertebrates in the ocean including salmon, rays, sharks (even white sharks), large baleen whales, and nearly 20 species of pinniped. The predation of whale calves may be responsible for annual whale migrations to calving grounds in more tropical waters, where the population of killer whales is much lower than in polar waters. Prior to whaling, it is thought that great whales were a major food source; however, after their sharp decline, killer whales have since expanded their diet, leading to the decline of smaller marine mammals. A decline in Aleutian Islands sea otter populations in the 1990s was controversially attributed by some scientists to killer whale predation, although with no direct evidence. The decline of sea otters followed a decline in harbor seal and <b>Steller</b> sea lion populations, the killer whale's preferred prey, which in turn may be substitutes for their original prey, now reduced by industrial whaling.|$|E
5|$|Warring Capulets (Michael Toland) and Montagues (Stephen Goldberg), {{portrayed as}} <b>Steller</b> and California sea lions respectively, have their feud watched sadly by Capulet's only daughter, Juliet (Patricia Trippett). A {{fight on the}} shore is ended when the Prince (Phil Nibbelink), a large and monstrous {{elephant}} seal, appears and warns the two groups that, should there be any more disturbance, the seal who caused it shall be exiled to Shark Island, a fin shaped rock where a shark lives. Romeo (Daniel Tripett), Montague's only son, is depressed, wishing {{to fall in love}} with someone. His humorous friend, Mercutio (Chip Albers), urges him and another of his friends, Benvolio (Sam Gold), to go to a Capulet party later that evening. They attend the party, covered in white sand to look like Capulets, and Romeo falls in love with Juliet at first sight. Juliet, however, was promised by her father to marry the Prince, who attends the party. Romeo and his friends manage to wreak havoc, and are revealed to be Montagues. Later that evening, the play's balcony scene is recreated on a cliff on the beach where a tree grows. Romeo promises Juliet that they shall marry the next morning, and she will not have to marry the Prince.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Steller</b> {{sea lion}} (Eumetopias jubatus) {{also known as}} the {{northern}} sea lion and Steller's sea lion, is a near threatened species of sea lions in the northern Pacific. It is the sole member of the genus Eumetopias and the largest of the eared seals (Otariidae). Among pinnipeds, it is inferior in size only to the walrus and the two elephant seals. The species is named for the naturalist Georg Wilhelm <b>Steller,</b> who first described them in 1741. The <b>Steller</b> sea lion has attracted considerable attention in recent decades due to significant, unexplained declines in their numbers over a large portion of their range in Alaska.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, <b>Steller</b> {{sea lions}} {{have been known}} to enter the Columbia River estuary and feed on white sturgeon, several salmon species and rainbow trout, some of which are also listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. They enter the Columbia River {{primarily}} in the late winter and spring, occasionally going as far upstream as Bonneville Dam. Though not as abundant as the California sea lion, they are still a concern for those agencies charged with managing the fish populations. Since the <b>Steller</b> sea lions are themselves protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, managers are compelled to use nonlethal deterrence methods, such as rubber bullets and noisemakers. Deterrence by the public is strictly forbidden.|$|E

50|$|Because of its {{isolation}} {{and the high}} productivity of the Bering Sea and the Pacific continental shelf, the reserve {{is marked by a}} great diversity of animal life. It is a refuge for over a million seabirds, several hundred thousand northern fur seals, several thousand <b>Steller's</b> sea lions, common seals, and spotted seals, a healthy population of sea otter, some 21 whale species, two rare endemic subspecies of Arctic fox, and many endangered or threatened migratory birds, such as the whooper swan, <b>Steller's</b> eider, and <b>Steller's</b> sea eagle.

25|$|Reproductively mature male {{sea lions}} {{aggregate}} in May on traditional, well-defined reproductive rookeries, usually on beaches on isolated islands. The larger, older males establish and defend distinct territories on the rookery. A {{week or so}} later, adult females arrive, accompanied occasionally by sexually immature offspring, and form fluid aggregations throughout the rookery. Like all other otariids, <b>Steller</b> sea lions are polygynous. However, unlike some other species, they do not coerce individual females into harems, but control spatial territories among which females freely move about. <b>Steller</b> sea lions have used aquatic, semiaquatic, and terrestrial territories. Males with semiaquatic territories have the most success in defending them. The boundaries are defined by natural features, such as rocks, faults, or ridges in rocks, and territories can remain stable for 60 days. Though <b>Steller</b> sea lion males are generally tolerant of pups, one male filmed on Medny Island in Russia was documented killing and eating several pups in a first ever recorded incident of cannibalism. Though researchers are uncertain as to the motives or reasons behind said attacks, {{it is suggested that}} the bull involved may have an abnormal personality akin to being psychotic.|$|E
25|$|The {{range of}} the <b>Steller</b> sea lion extends from the Kuril Islands and the Sea of Okhotsk in Russia to the Gulf of Alaska in the north, and south to Año Nuevo Island off central California. They {{formerly}} bred {{as far south as}} the Channel Islands, but have not been observed there since the 1980s. Based on genetic anаlyses and local migration patterns, the global <b>Steller</b> sea lion population has traditionally been divided into an eastern and western stock at 144°W longitude, roughly through the middle of the Gulf of Alaska. Recent evidence suggests the sea lions in Russia in the Sea of Okhotsk and the Kuril Islands comprise a third Asian stock, while the sea lions on the eastern seaboard of Kamchatka and the Commander Islands belong to the western stock.|$|E
