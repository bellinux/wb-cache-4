40|$|The Seine {{watershed}} {{has long}} been the food-supplying hinterland of Paris, providing most of the animal and vegetal protein consumed in the city. Nowadays, because of the land <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>agriculture</b> made possible by the shift from manure-based to synthetic nitrogen fertilisation, the Seine watershed, although it exports 80 % of its huge cereal production, still provides most of the cereal consumed by the Paris agglomeration. The meat and milk supply originate, however, mainly from regions in the North and West of France, specialised in animal farming and importing about 30 % of their feed from South America. As it works today, this system is responsible for a severe nitrate contamination of surface groundwater resources. Herein two scenarios of re-localising Paris's food supply are explored, based on organic farming and local provision of animal feed. We show that for the Seine watershed it is technically possible to design an agricultural system able to provide all the plant- and animal-based food required by the population, to deliver sub-root water meeting the drinking water standards and still to export a significant proportion of its production to areas less suitable for cereal cultivation. Decreasing the share of animal products in the human diet has a strong impact on the nitrogen imprint of urban food supply...|$|E
40|$|All {{throughout}} the Mediterranean, European agriculture undergoes deep structural transformations, related both with new production conditions, {{but also with}} new demands and requirements for the rural space and the functions that agriculture displays in it. Remote rural areas are normally more reluctant towards these new demands, especially when these concern other issues than production, but nevertheless the attitude toward the landscape understanding and its values has been shifting also here. At the foot of Serra de São Mamede uplands, the confrontation of the new agriculture and society demands with the small-scale farming is observed. As the most conflicting influences on landscape seem to be: • The complex modification of rural society and its lifestyle in last three generations • The possibility of Marvão being accepted as world heritage by UNESCO • Intellectual and economic impact on area form tourist and new-settlers Intensification and rationalisation of agriculture are weak. While the oldest generations are still mainly responsible for the practical field-work, maintaining the traditional polycultures; the younger ones are leaving in search for better future or work in other professions. On {{the other side of}} the border the situation is different, the intensification and <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>agriculture</b> has already taken place here. Through other political supports, this area with similar biophysical characteristics has developed in a different way. The aim of this paper is to analyse the probable future of these traditional farming systems considering the area capacity for trans-border interaction, which may contribute to their renovation. 1...|$|E
40|$|Intensification and <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>agriculture</b> in {{developed}} countries enabled productivity to be improved but had detrimental impacts {{on the environment and}} threatened the economic viability of a huge number of farms. The combination of livestock and crops, which was very common in the past, is assumed to be a viable alternative to specialised livestock or cropping systems. Mixed crop-livestock systems can improve nutrient cycling while reducing chemical inputs and generate economies of scope at farm level. Most assumptions underlying these views are based on theoretical and experimental evidence. Very few assessments of their environmental and economic advantages have nevertheless been undertaken in real-world farming conditions. In this paper, we present a comparative assessment of the environmental and economic performances of mixed crop-livestock farms v. specialised farms among the farm population of the French ‘Coteaux de Gascogne’. In this hilly region, half of the farms currently use a mixed crop-livestock system including beef cattle and cash crops, the remaining farms being specialised in either crops or cattle. Data were collected through an exhaustive survey of farms located in our study area. The economic performances of farming systems were assessed on 48 farms on the basis of (i) overall gross margin, (ii) production costs and (iii) analysis of the sensitivity of gross margins to fluctuations in the price of inputs and outputs. The environmental dimension was analysed through (i) characterisation of farmers’ crop management practices, (ii) analysis of farm land use diversity and (iii) nitrogen farm-gate balance. Local mixed crop-livestock farms did not have significantly higher overall gross margins than specialised farms but were less sensitive than dairy and crop farmsto fluctuations in the price of inputs and outputs considered. Mixed crop-livestock farms had lower costs than crop farms, while beef farms had the lowest costs as they are grass-based systems. Concerning crop management practices, our results revealed an intensification gradient from low to high input farming systems. Beyond some general trends, a wide range of management practices and levels of intensification were observed among farms with a similar production system. Mixed crop-livestock farms were very heterogeneous with respect to the use of inputs. Nevertheless, our study revealed a lower potential for nitrogen pollution in mixed crop-livestock and beef production systems than in dairy and crop farming systems. Even if a wide variability exists within system, mixed crop-livestock systems appear to be a way for an environmental and economical sustainable agriculture...|$|E

Ten years ago, L. Brown (1994) predicted that China would reduce its cultivated surfaces due to rapid industrialisation, leading to a major crisis for world grain markets, thus causing an undesirable Big Bang. Recent data from Chinese sources does not back up this analysis. Three scenarios of probable future trends consider variation of land allocation and market supply. Conclusions suggest that a new <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> Chinese <b>agriculture</b> in labour intensive production, currently under way, can be sustained in the decades to come.

40|$|In this {{tutorial}} the <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> declarative logic {{programs is}} presented. The main correctness results are given, and {{the outline of}} a basic algorithm for partial evaluation of a logic program with respect to a goal. The practical considerations of gaining efficiency (and not losing any) are discussed. A renaming scheme for performing structure specialisation is then described, and illustrated on a well-known string matching example. The basic algorithm is enhanced by incorporating abstract interpretation. A two-phase specialisation is then described and illustrated, in which partial evaluation is followed by the detection and removal of useless clauses. This is shown for the <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> a proof procedure for first order logic. The <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> meta programs is very important in logic programming, and the ground representation for object programs has to be handled. Some techniques for doing this are described. Comparisons are made in the tutorial to similar work in other programming languages, and the similarities and differences between them and logic program specialisation is discussed...|$|R
