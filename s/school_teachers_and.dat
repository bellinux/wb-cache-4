25|$|Indonesian {{is based}} on the {{prestige}} dialect of Malay, which for centuries had been the lingua franca of the archipelago.

Indonesian is universally taught in schools and consequently is spoken by nearly every Indonesian. It was promoted by Indonesian nationalists in the 1920s, and declared the official language under the name Bahasa Indonesia in the proclamation of independence in 1945. Most Indonesians speak at least one of several hundred local languages and dialects, often as their first language, of which Javanese is the most widely spoken, as it is the language of the largest ethnic group.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} deals with {{subjects}} {{as diverse as}} [...] "isolated communities, old <b>school</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> Roman roads", but maintains a [...] "warped coherency". According to Rhys, Mwngs lyrics—which he considers to be some of his best—were written [...] "very simply" [...] and convey simple messages. The singer {{made an effort to}} be economical with his words, not communicating a lot of information with them. Rhys feels that the album is accessible to non-Welsh speakers, citing his own experience of listening to Nirvana: [...] "If I listen to a Nirvana record I don't understand most of their lyrics cos he's just screaming away, but I just understand the frustration and the passion in his voice. I think equally people can get off on this record by just hitting on the mood of the song, or connecting to the mood of the song." ...|$|E

Meanwhile, skaters are using the ramp, Cyrus stands and {{performs}} the song in a confused manner. She then enters a school bus, occupied by businessmen and businesswomen, which she exits through the back emergency door. Throughout the rest of the video Cyrus is seen exploring a [...] "carnival-like" [...] setting, while dancing. Several random figures make appearances, such as astronauts, scuba divers, middle <b>school</b> <b>teachers,</b> <b>and</b> cowboys. A large star pattern falls and reveals a concert stage where Cyrus performs the song along with a band. In the conclusion of the video, Cyrus is woken up by an alarm clock and a printer prints stills from what occurred throughout the music video. The music video to [...] "Start All Over" [...] was first seen on the Disney Channel on December 19, 2007. It became digitally available, via iTunes Store, on January 29, 2008.

500|$|Mwng is an {{understated}} rock record {{inspired by}} the band's love of [...] "Anglo-American pop culture of the 60s, 70s and 80s." [...] The album has a [...] "wintery persona" [...] that is best summed up by the track [...] "Ymaelodi Â'r Ymylon". Rhys feels that the record {{marks the first time}} the band managed to escape their influences and clearly establish their own sound. The album's lyrics deal with a diverse set of subjects, such as the death of rural communities, old <b>school</b> <b>teachers,</b> <b>and</b> Sarn Helen (a Roman road built in Wales). Rhys has stated that many of Mwngs songs are highly personal reflections on what were difficult years for him. Rhys has also expressed the belief that the album is accessible to non-Welsh speakers, as they can pick up on the mood of the songs even if they cannot understand the lyrics. Critical reception was generally positive, although some reviewers criticised the album for its [...] "bare-boned production". Mwng was included in both the Melody Maker and NME [...] "Best album of 2000" [...] lists, with the latter calling the record the band's best release. The band were surprised by album's commercial success, entering number 11 in the UK charts, and going on to become the biggest-selling Welsh language album.|$|E
500|$|Schönerer {{founded the}} [...] "German National Society", and later, in 1891, the [...] "Pan-German Society". He demanded the {{annexation}} of all German-speaking territories of Austria-Hungary to the Prussian-led German Empire and rejected {{any form of}} Austrian pan-ethnic identity. His radical racist German nationalism was especially popular amongst the well-educated intelligentsia: professors, grammar <b>school</b> <b>teachers,</b> <b>and</b> students. School administrations tried to counteract these sentiments by encouraging civic pride, along with a [...] "cult of personality" [...] around the Emperor, but these efforts were largely unsuccessful. Vienna mayor Karl Lueger even tried to dismiss all [...] "Schönerians" [...] from city school administrations, but this too failed. National-minded students rather identified with the Prussian-led German Empire than with the multiethnic Dual Monarchy. Many idolised the German chancellor Otto von Bismarck, victor in the Battle of Königgrätz. Members of the pan-German movement wore blue cornflowers, known to be the favourite flower of German Emperor William I, in their buttonholes, along with cockades in the German national colours (black, red, and yellow). Both symbols were temporarily banned in Austrian schools. By contrast with the German National Society, the [...] "German Club" [...] accepted the Habsburg dynasty, and the sovereignty of Austria. The majority of German nationalists and liberals adhered to this more moderate ideology.|$|E
500|$|A {{day after}} the Dade County repeal, State Assemblyman Art Agnos, who {{represented}} portions of San Francisco with a very high population of gays and lesbians, decided not to submit a gay civil rights bill to the state legislature, reasoning {{that it no longer}} had any support. California state senator John Briggs, from Fullerton was in the crowd with Anita Bryant the night she and Save Our Children won the Dade County vote. Greatly impressed by the voter turnout, Briggs had designs to win the race for governor of California for 1978. When he returned from Miami, since there was no gay rights law to overturn, he proposed a law to forbid employing openly gay public <b>school</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> other workers. The bill, Proposition 6—nicknamed the Briggs Initiative—was written so broadly that it also allowed the dismissal of any public school employee for supporting gay rights including voting against Proposition 6, regardless of their sexual orientation. He stated, [...] "What I am after is to remove those homosexual teachers who through word, thought or deed want to be a public homosexual, to entice young impressionable children into their lifestyle". Briggs announced the proposition on the steps of San Francisco City Hall, after notifying several local gay organizations of his intentions. The city had experienced an influx of so many gay people in the past ten years that they counted as a quarter of its voting population.|$|E
