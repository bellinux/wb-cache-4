5|$|Females {{are sexually}} mature at {{two to three}} years of age and males at about two years. Breeding occurs {{throughout}} the year, but it peaks during winter and early <b>spring.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> northern Sahara, breeding peaks at the end of winter and beginning of spring; in the southern Sahara, breeding peaks from September to October and from January to mid-April. Each estrus bout lasts for one or two days.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{distinct}} local weather phenomena, marked downslope lee winds {{caused by the}} proximity of the Pennines, leading to super geostrophic winds which can reach in excess of 60KT (70mph), most commonly in winter and <b>spring.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> winter the presence of a subsidence inversion between the Pennines and the North York Moors can allow dense, persistent fog to form which can last for several days.|$|E
5|$|Like other requiem sharks, the {{dusky shark}} is viviparous: the {{developing}} embryos are initially nourished by a yolk sac, which is {{converted into a}} placental connection to the mother once the yolk supply is exhausted. Mating occurs during <b>spring</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northwestern Atlantic, while {{there appears to be}} no reproductive seasonality in other regions such as off South Africa. Females are capable of storing masses of sperm, possibly from multiple males, for months to years within their nidamental glands (an organ that secretes egg cases). This would be advantageous given the sharks' itinerant natures and low natural abundance, which would make encounters with suitable mates infrequent and unpredictable.|$|E

5|$|MD410 was {{originally}} built along mostly new alignment between Bethesda and Silver <b>Spring</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1920s. The highway was extended east to Hyattsville in the mid-1930s. While the Montgomery County portion {{has not changed}} much in the ensuing decades, MD 410 has been realigned and extended multiple times within Prince George's County. These changes include an extension along existing roads further into Hyattsville in the mid-1940s, a realignment within Hyattsville in the mid-1950s, an extension through Riverdale in the late 1960s, and the final extension to Landover Hills in the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Some {{evidence}} {{does suggest that}} the Southern Oscillation is weakly correlated with changes in tornado activity, which vary by season and region, as well as whether the ENSO phase is that of El Niño or La Niña. Research has found that fewer tornadoes and hailstorms occur in winter and <b>spring</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. central and southern plains during El Niño, and more occur during La Niña, than in years when temperatures in the Pacific are relatively stable. Ocean conditions {{could be used to}} forecast extreme spring storm events several months in advance.|$|E
5|$|The Nebula Awards {{annually}} {{recognize the}} best works {{of science fiction}} or fantasy published in the United States. The awards are organized and awarded by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA), a nonprofit association of professional science fiction and fantasy writers. They were first given in 1966 at a ceremony created for the awards, and are given in four categories for different lengths of literary works. A fifth category for film and television episode scripts was given 1974–78 and 2000–09. The rules governing the Nebula Awards have changed {{several times during the}} awards' history, most recently in 2010. The SFWA Nebula Conference, at which the awards are announced and presented, is held each <b>spring</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. Locations vary from year to year.|$|E

5|$|The {{city was}} {{supplied}} with water by an aqueduct that ran from a <b>spring</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hills behind the city. The aqueduct {{may have been}} constructed around 60–80AD and was subsequently reconstructed on several occasions. An elaborate network of channels fed houses and the public baths from the municipal supply {{and a series of}} drains carried sewage and waste away to the river to be flushed. The aqueduct ran under the Decumanus Secundus, a street that ran parallel with the Decumanus Maximus, and terminated at a large fountain in the city centre near the Arch of Caracalla.|$|E
5|$|The onion {{plant has}} {{a fan of}} hollow, bluish-green leaves and its bulb {{at the base of}} the plant begins to swell when a certain day-length is reached. The bulbs are {{composed}} of shortened, compressed, underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale (leaves) that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem. In the autumn (or in <b>spring,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of overwintering onions), the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become dry and brittle. The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage. The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases, particularly the onion fly, the onion eelworm, and various fungi cause rotting. Some varieties of A. cepa, such as shallots and potato onions, produce multiple bulbs.|$|E
5|$|Gascoigne {{was then}} given a {{significant}} opportunity {{that became the}} focus of the remainder of his paid academic career: to help establish one of the world's largest optical telescopes, at Siding <b>Spring.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> early 1960s, the Australian and British governments proposed a partnership to build a joint optical telescope facility, and Gascoigne was among the experts involved. Former Mount Stromlo director and now head of the Greenwich observatory, Richard Woolley, was prominent in supporting the project from the British end. In 1967, the two governments formally agreed to collaborate on the construction of a large telescope, {{to be known as the}} Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT). Given the existing infrastructure of the ANU's Siding Spring Observatory, the site was readily agreed as the location for the AAT. Gascoigne was one of the four members of the Technical Committee established to guide the telescope's development. He provided leadership on the design and optics of the new telescope, and was made the chief commissioning astronomer in 1974.|$|E

5|$|With the {{ambition}} to become London's sole burial site in perpetuity, the LNC {{were aware that}} if their plans were successful, their Necropolis would become a site of major national importance. As a consequence, the cemetery was designed with attractiveness in mind, {{in contrast to the}} squalid and congested London burial grounds and the newer suburban cemeteries which were already becoming crowded. The LNC aimed to create an atmosphere of perpetual <b>spring</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cemetery, and chose the plants for the cemetery accordingly. It had already been noted that evergreen plants from North America thrived in the local soil. Robert Donald, the owner of an arboretum near Woking, was contracted to supply the trees and shrubs for the cemetery. The railway line through the cemetery and the major roads and paths within the cemetery were lined with giant sequoia trees, the first significant planting of these trees (only introduced to Europe in 1853) in Britain. As well as the giant sequoias, the grounds were heavily planted with magnolia, rhododendron, coastal redwood, azalea, andromeda and monkeypuzzle, with the intention of creating perpetual greenery with large numbers of flowers and a strong floral scent throughout the cemetery.|$|E
