In 2001, the village of Homer Glen was incorporated within area that is Homer Township. This region was formerly an unincorporated census-designated place known as Goodings Grove, Illinois. Homer Township, located between Orland Park, and the historic cities of Lemont and Lockport, offers parks, golf courses and many beautiful wooded settings, as well as convenient access to route 83 and interstates 355 and 55. In 2011, Homer Glen was the third community to be named an International Dark-Sky Community by the International Dark Sky Association (IDA). This highly distinguished honor has only been bestowed on four communities to date. The award acknowledges that the Village has been selected as a community that has taken extraordinary steps in recognizing and preserving the natural night. To achieve the IDSC award, the Village of Homer Glen demonstrated that it has shown “exceptional dedication {{to the preservation of}} the night sky through the implementation and enforcement of quality lighting codes, dark sky education and citizen support of dark skies.” In 2007, the Village passed a ground breaking outdoor lighting ordinance which became the first stand alone ordinance of its kind in Illinois. The ordinance provides a clear set of guidelines eliminating the need for commercial establishments to compete for visual attention by escalating their outdoor lighting levels. It also requires full cutoff lighting, limits the amount of light that is used on the property, promotes the safety and welfare of pedestrians, cyclists and motorists who all benefit from the reduction of glare, reduces the detrimental effect to wildlife that depend on the natural cycle of day and night for survival and protects neighbors from unwanted light spilling onto their property. These <b>sound</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>policies</b> benefit residents and serve as a positive example for reducing the amount of energy consumed and natural resources used. Additionally, the Homer Glen ordinance reduces both money spent on over-lighting, as well as light projected into the night sky.|$|E

Answers are sought in processes for social learning and adaptive co-management that engage experts, decision makers, and local actors in an interactive way of policy making. The preparation and organization of such interactive processes is usefully supported by actor analysis, which can help to identify the main actors to be involved in environmental policy making, to locate useful local knowledge, to identify potential conflicts, and to assess the feasibility of different policy measures. I explored the promise that actor analysis holds to support environmental experts in environmental policy analysis activities. I present and discuss the findings from four cases in water resources management. These findings are counterintuitive in that they suggest that environmental experts are more reluctant to use the insights provided by actor analysis than one would expect based on their frequently expressed desire to improve their connection with decision makers.

It assumes that burning {{takes place in}} the middle and late-dry seasons, views African savannas as one of the “burn centers” of the planet, and considers biomass burning to be an important source of greenhouse gas emissions. The research presented in this brief, however, took a political-ecological approach to advance the understanding of burning regimes and to present a more accurate assessment of land use and land cover change in the Sudanian savannas of Côte d’Ivoire. Findings show that contemporary agricultural and pastoral practices generate early fires that result in low burning intensity, more frequent and small fires, and inefficient combustion. The results also show that the Sudanian savannas are complex and differentiated ecosystems composed of several vegetation types, and that grass biomass load is declining while woody vegetation cover is increasing over time. Increased tree vegetation cover will sequester more carbon dioxide. The knowledge generated here is crucial for environmental decision-making.

Most of these preservation/ enhancement banks use minimum mitigation ratios of 1 : 1, which is much lower than ratios given in current guidelines. Assuming that mitigation occurs in these banks as preservation at the minimum allowable ratio, ten of these banks, concentrated in the western Gulf Coast region, will account for over 99 % of projected net wetland acreage loss associated with banks.

Although projected changes in climate through to 2080 are likely to create favorable environments for range expansion of the 15 tree species by 65 % on average, by limiting the potential movement by previously published migration rates and landscape fragmentation, range expansion will likely be 50 %– 90 % of the potential.

Groundwater decline is most severe in the Alluvial Fans where our study site is located. Avoiding a foreseeable systems collapse requires region-wide changes in crop systems management, underpinned by <b>sound</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>policies.</b> Here, we explore the potential of crop system adaptation to remedy the excessive water use and quantify the likely yield penalties associated with more sustainable water use practices. Using simulations with the APSIM cropping systems model we explore production opportunities in an area within the NCP with intensive cropping and no access to irrigation from rivers. We estimate the attainable production levels for wheat and maize if agriculture were made groundwater neutral, through changes in crop sequence, irrigation practices and water conservation technologies (e. g. mulching with plastic film). Total grain production would drop by 44 % compared to current practice if agriculture were made groundwater neutral. Water conservation by plastic film could limit this reduction to 21 - 33 % but possible environmental impacts of plastic film need attention. This analysis facilitates a much needed debate on alternative agronomic practices and incentives through a quantitative comparison of adaptation options.

Land units were characterized from a phytosociological viewpoint, and their naturalness evaluated using the Index of Landscape Conservation status. Comparison of current and past vegetation naturalness of land units was used to prepare the map of changes in landscape naturalness in the Fiastra and Salino catchment basins (central Italy) at a scale of 1 : 50, 000. It was found that, while the change of naturalness in the whole study area was around zero, the pattern of distribution of this change was heterogeneous: naturalness increased in land units of high hilly and mountain belts, mostly because of the spread of woods, to the detriment of shrublands, pre-wooded communities, and grasslands, while the opposite trend was recorded in the alluvial plain and low hills, because of increasing urbanization and landscape homogenization caused by the transformation of grasslands, shrublands, pre-wooded communities, and treeplanted arable lands into arable lands. The hierarchical approach to landscape classification and mapping provided information that could have not been detected by mere calculation of indices.

Food provisioning in the form of fisheries catch, aquaculture, ornamentals and bio prospecting is the most vital services from this system. The Total Economic Value of (TEV) consists of use values and non-use values. The use value includes direct use value, indirect use value, and option value, whereas the non-use value is the existence and bequest value. Three approaches are used in the valuation techniques: Slated preference (contingent valuation and choice modelling); Revealed preference (market price, cost-based, production, travel cost); Benefit transfer.
