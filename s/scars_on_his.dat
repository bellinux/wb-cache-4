5|$|Fanny {{opened the}} door again and Powell shoved past her to Seward's bed. He stabbed at Seward's face and neck, slicing open his cheek, but the splint doctors had fitted to Seward's broken jaw (often mistakenly {{described}} as a neck brace) prevented the blade from penetrating his jugular vein. He eventually recovered, though with serious <b>scars</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face.|$|E
5|$|The video premiered on October 4, 1994, on MTV. It {{begins with}} showing the {{neighborhood}} of Harlem, with Madonna as a singer in a small jazz club. She simply sits in the club with her band and sings for her small, mostly black and Latino audience. Interspersed throughout the video are scenes {{of people living in}} Harlem, doing their daily chores, including a supporting cast of transvestite prostitutes, a pimp, and a black gang member who shows off the <b>scars</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> body. During the intermediate verses, Madonna is shown writhing in the lap of an older, maternal woman, who symbolically baptizes her by splashing water on her forehead. Near the video's end, Madonna walks through the neighborhood and climbs a set of stairs to have a reunion with her family, a young Latin man and their supposed son. The video ends with Madonna smiling towards the camera while sitting at the nightclub.|$|E

25|$|Distinctive {{features}} on the male were a white <b>scar</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> forehead, a vaccination <b>scar</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> left shoulder and another <b>on</b> <b>his</b> left wrist. <b>On</b> <b>his</b> right foot, he had hammer toe deformities, {{which may have been}} due to wearing tight-fitting shoes or possibly other reasons. After the examination of his body was complete, the young man was buried in the Tooele City Cemetery, after the case remained unsolved.|$|R

25|$|With the {{exception}} of Taboada, all {{of the victims were}} petite Caucasian brunettes with brown eyes. Although law enforcement authorities initially had very few leads, police did identify two suspects; one a University of Florida student who had a history of mental illness and bore numerous <b>scars</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face from a car accident, making him an ideal image when discussing news about the investigation. His photo was shown repeatedly by media outlets. Authorities publicly cleared Humphrey of all charges after Rolling's arrest. The other suspect was also later cleared.|$|E
25|$|The defense {{tried to}} {{convince}} the jury that Simpson was not physically capable of carrying out the murders, saying that Goldman was a fit young man who put up a fierce struggle against his assailant. Simpson was a 46-year-old former professional football player with chronic arthritis. He had <b>scars</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> knees from old football injuries. But Clark produced into evidence an exercise video that Simpson made {{a few months before}} the murders titled O.J. Simpson Minimum Maintenance: Fitness For Men, which showed that, despite some physical conditions and limitations, Simpson was anything but frail.|$|E
25|$|Many Russians {{believed}} that tsars and tsarevichs bore special marks {{on their bodies}} symbolising their royal status, which became known as royal marks. Four of the pretenders claiming to be Peter III showed royal marks to legitimise their claims. The first fake Peter to have royal marks was Gavrila Kremnev who Lev Evdokimov recognised because of a cross on Kremnev's foot. Lev Evdokimov claimed that he {{had worked as a}} chorister at the royal palace and had held the real Peter III in his arms as a child therefore giving credibility to Kremnev's claims. Despite Kremnev's marking, he never gained many supporters and was flogged and branded with the words, “deserter and pretender”. The next fake Peter III to show a royal mark of some sort was Fedot Kazin-Bogomolov in 1772. He showed a guard where he was imprisoned a cross on his chest and claimed he had two more on his arm and head allowing him to gain many supporters. The government branded Kazin-Bogomolov despite his markings. The third Peter III with royal marks was the most famous of the four and the most successful pretender of the time, Pugachev. In 1773 Pugachev staged a revealing of his royal identity to a cossack, Eremina Kuritsa, leading other cossacks to challenge Pugachev at dinner, which resulted in him showing <b>scars</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> chest and head to the cossacks. Pugachev claimed the <b>scars</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> chest were caused from the coup against him and that the <b>scars</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> forehead were from smallpox. Pugachev's rational reasoning for his markings caused him to continually gain supporters throughout his stand as a pretender. Unlike the first two pretenders to show royal marks, Pugachev's efforts cost him his life since his punishment was execution. The final pretender during Catherine's reign to reveal royal marks was Makar Mosiakin in 1774. Mosiakin entered a peasant hut claiming to be Peter III and then showed the peasants crosses on his arms, claiming they represented royal inheritance. According to the official report of the Mosiakin he had made the cross marks himself to convince people that he was Peter III and he actually had some success as he managed to gain followers from various villages as he went from house to house.|$|E

25|$|Hardin {{eventually}} {{adapted to}} prison life. While there, he read theological books, becoming {{the superintendent of}} the prison Sunday School, and studied law. He was plagued by recurring poor health, especially when the wound he had received from Sublett became re-infected in 1883, causing him to be bedridden for almost two years. In 1892, Hardin was described as 5 feet 9 inches tall and 160 pounds, with a fair complexion, hazel eyes, dark hair, and wound <b>scars</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> right knee, left thigh, right side, hip, elbow, shoulder, and back. During Hardin's stay in prison, his first wife, Jane, died, on November 6, 1892.|$|E
25|$|On April 12, {{the detainees}} {{were taken to}} the {{headquarters}} of the Mexican Federal Judicial Police in Matamoros for an informal press conference. More than 250 international journalists arrived at the scene to take pictures and ask them questions. The four suspects were paraded from the building's balcony and were allowed to answer questions from reporters. Elio stated that he was an ordained executioner under Constanzo and that Kilroy was murdered by Constanzo. As the cameras zoomed in on the suspects, Elio showed his membership <b>scars</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> shoulders, back, arms, and chest. These were arrow-like cuts made with a hot blade. The marks were given to selected cult members with the authority to perform human sacrifice.|$|E
25|$|During the Revolutionary War, Jackson's eldest brother, Hugh, {{died from}} heat {{exhaustion}} after the Battle of Stono Ferry on June 20, 1779. Anti-British sentiment intensified following the brutal Waxhaws Massacre on May 29, 1780. Jackson's mother encouraged {{him and his}} elder brother Robert to attend the local militia drills. Soon, they began to help the militia as couriers. They served under Colonel William Richardson Davie at the Battle of Hanging Rock on August 6. Andrew and Robert were eventually captured by the British in 1781 while staying {{at the home of}} the Crawford family. When Andrew refused to clean the boots of a British officer, the officer slashed at the youth with a sword, leaving him with <b>scars</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> left hand and head, as well as an intense hatred for the British. Robert also refused to do as commanded and was struck with the sword. The two brothers were held as prisoners, contracted smallpox, and nearly starved to death in captivity.|$|E

25|$|In early 1969, Bonin {{was arrested}} as he {{attempted}} to restrain a 16-year-old youth whom he had lured into his vehicle; he was indicted on five counts of kidnapping, four counts of sodomy, one count of oral copulation, and one count of child molestation against the five youths he had abducted and assaulted or—in {{the case of the}} final youth he had abducted—attempted to assault since the previous November. Bonin pleaded guilty to molestation and forced oral copulation and was sentenced to the Atascadero State Hospital as a mentally disordered sexual offender considered amenable to treatment in January 1971. While detained at this hospital, Bonin was subjected to a battery of psychiatric examinations: these examinations revealed that Bonin possessed a higher than average IQ of 121, and displayed traits of manic depression in addition to damage to the prefrontal cortex of his brain—which would likely reduce his ability to restrain any violent impulses; his physical examinations also revealed extensive <b>scars</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> head and buttocks, which he had likely sustained in the three years he had been housed at the Connecticut juvenile detention center as a child, although Bonin claimed to have no memory of any such incidents of abuse.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{his body}} being {{identified}} by police and a priest before being burnt, {{there have also}} been stories that both Dan and Steve survived the fire. There is little evidence to support these claims. One man, James Ryan, said he was Dan Kelly. In 1934 he went on stage at the Brisbane Exhibition and told stories about the Kelly Gang. He died on 29 July 1948, after being struck by a train. The Ipswich City Council have put a memorial on his grave. In 2001, scientists took a small piece of bone from the grave of Charles Devine Tindall at Toowoomba, Queensland, {{to see if they could}} find DNA to prove he was Dan Kelly. Devine, who had burn <b>scars</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> body, told his family he was really Dan. He said he had hidden under the floor of the Glenrowan hotel and escaped after the fire. An archaeological dig at the site of the hotel by Adam Ford in 2008 found that there was no cellar or other hiding place under the floors. In October 1902, a Melbourne newspaper printed a story that Dan Kelly and Steve Hart were living in South Africa. The men had fought in the Boer War. Another man, Jim Davis from Darra (a suburb of Brisbane, Queensland), said in 1938 that he was Dan Kelly. He claimed that he, Steve Hart and Joe Byrne had escaped from the hotel. He also said he was born at the Eureka Stockade in 1854, which makes him too old to have really been Dan.|$|E
