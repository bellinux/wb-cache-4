40|$|Project Abstract: We {{argue that}} further {{substantial}} advancement in quantum gravity may remain elusive until a clarification of crucial conceptual problems is achieved. In particular, {{we believe that}} a fundamental resolution for the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> the <b>equivalence</b> principle in the quantum domain {{could prove to be}} central towards a solution of such conceptual problems. We critically analyze the scenario of enunciating a quantum version <b>of</b> the <b>equivalence</b> principle as well as the possibility of it being an emergent phenomenon with no fundamental counterpart in quantum gravity. We explore the issue {{from the point of view}} that all our information of the properties of spacetime comes from its interaction with quantum matter and that the notion of a physical geometry existing independently of the physical objects used to determine it may be a harmful idealizations for the construction of a quantum theory of gravity.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{studies the}} decidability <b>status</b> <b>of</b> various <b>equivalence</b> {{problems}} in form theory. Most of our discussions concern {{the notion of}} a language form. We compare the form equivalence problem between language forms with the ordinary equivalence problem between languages. However, the main results deal with L forms and grammar forms under strict interpretations. We prove that the form equivalence problem is undecidable for (a) context-free grammar forms, and (b) E 0 L forms. The proofs of these results are based on our investigations concerning language forms...|$|R
40|$|The <b>equivalence</b> <b>of</b> {{inertial}} and gravitational masses is {{a defining}} feature of general relativity. Here, we clarify the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> the <b>equivalence</b> principle for interactions mediated by a universally coupled scalar, motivated partly by recent attempts to modify gravity at cosmological distances. Although a universal scalar-matter coupling is not mandatory, once postulated, it is stable against classical and quantum renormalizations {{in the matter}} sector. The coupling strength itself is subject to renormalization of course. The scalar equivalence principle is violated only for objects for which either the graviton self-interaction or the scalar self-interaction is important [...] -the first applies to black holes, while the second type of violation is avoided if the scalar is Galilean-symmetric.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the classical-quantum correspondence shows {{that it needs to}} identify a preferred class of coordinate systems, which defines a torsionless connection. One such class is that of the locally-geodesic systems, corresponding to the Levi-Civita connection. Another class, thus another connection, emerges if a preferred reference frame is available. From the classical Hamiltonian that rules geodesic motion, the correspondence yields two distinct Klein-Gordon equations and two distinct Dirac-type equations in a general metric, depending on the connection used. Each of these two equations is generally-covariant, transforms the wave function as a four-vector, and differs from the Fock-Weyl gravitational Dirac equation (DFW equation). One obeys the equivalence principle in an often-accepted sense, whereas the DFW equation obeys that principle only in an extended sense. Comment: 35 pages.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{derivation}} of the effective {{equation of motion}} for a pointlike particle {{in the framework of}} quantum gravity. Just like the geodesic motion of a classical particle is a consequence of classical field theory coupled to general relativity, we introduce the similar notion of an effective equation of motion, but starting from an abstract quantum gravity description. In the presence of entanglement between gravity and matter, quantum effects give rise to modifications of the geodesic trajectory, primarily {{as a consequence of the}} nonzero overlap between various coherent states of the gravity-matter system. Finally, we discuss the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> the weak <b>equivalence</b> principle in quantum gravity and its possible violation due to the nongeodesic motion. Comment: 37 page...|$|R

40|$|We {{clarify the}} <b>status</b> <b>of</b> the c <b>equivalence</b> {{principle}} (c_u=c) recently proposed by Heras et al JoseAJP 2010,JoseEJP 2010 {{and show that}} its proposal leads to {{an extension of the}} current framework of classical relativistic electrodynamics (CRE). This is because in the MLT (mass, length and time) system of units, CRE theory can contain only one fundamental constant of nature and special relativity dictates that this must be c, the standard speed of light in vacuum, a point not sufficiently emphasized in most textbooks {{with the exception of a}} few such as Panofsky and Phillips PanofskyPhillips. The c equivalence principle Heras JoseAJP 2010,JoseEJP 2010 can be shown to be linked to the second postulate of special relativity which extends the constancy of the unique velocity of light to all of physics (especially to mechanics) other than electromagnetism. An interesting corollary is that both the weak <b>equivalence</b> principle <b>of</b> general relativity and the c equivalence principle are in fact one and the same, which we demonstrate within the context of Newtonian gravity.
