The Z-scores obtained on the <b>S-Test</b> were utilized to divide the participants into high, middle and low achievers. Among the ten factors underlying the SCS, i. e., Self Volunteering, Receptive Relatives, Maternal Supervision, Parental Monitoring, Teacher Consultation, Parental Expectation, Parental Rapport, Family Religiosity, Helpful Others and Parent Availability, high achievers’ Family Religiosity correlated significantly with their <b>S-Test</b> whereas a significant correlation was found between Parental Monitoring and <b>S-Test</b> for middle achievers, indicating that social capitals of these two ability groups function differently. The results also showed while middle achievers’ scores on the semantic subtest of <b>S-Test</b> related significantly and positively to Parental Monitoring, Teacher Consultation and Family Religiosity, they correlated significantly but negatively with Parental Expectation and Helpful Others on the syntactic subtest.

It is known that finding a minimum clique <b>s-t</b> separator is polynomial-time solvable (Tarjan 1985), while for example the problems of finding a minimum <b>s-t</b> separator that is a connected graph or an independent set are fixed-parameter tractable (Marx, O'Sullivan and Razgon, manuscript). We extend these results the following way: Finding a minimum c-connected <b>s-t</b> separator is FPT for c∈=∈ 2 and W[1]-hard for any c∈≥∈ 3. Finding a minimum <b>s-t</b> separator with diameter at most d is W[1]-hard for any d∈≥∈ 2. Finding a minimum r-regular <b>s-t</b> separator is W[1]-hard for any r∈≥∈ 1. For any decidable graph property, finding a minimum <b>s-t</b> separator with this property is FPT parameterized jointly {{by the size of}} the separator and the maximum degree.

Two other versions were, therefore, developed on the standard C-Tests, i. e., Context Independent (CI) C-Test, and Context Dependent (CD) C-Tests from which the CIC-Test items were removed. Inspired by Kamimoto (1993), the well functioning items of standard C-Tests developed by Klein-Braley (1997) and their CD and CI versions were employed to study their underlying factors. The factorial analysis of the three C-Tests revealed two latent variables representing reduced redundancy and another unknown construct. The inclusion of the TOEFL, LKT and <b>S-Test</b> in the analysis to illuminate the nature of the second factor, however, resulted in the extraction of three latent variables. Since the standard C-Tests and CDC-Tests loaded the highest on the first factor along with other tests, it represented reduced redundancy.

40|$|Analysis of {{vibration}} signatures {{was used}} as a reliable non-intrusive technique for detecting the hydrodynamic state of a polyethylene fluidized bed for early detection of agglomeration. Experiments were carried out in a pilot scale gas-solid fluidized bed at 15 - 25 bar and 100 degrees C. The bed was operating in the bubbling regime of fluidization. Accelerometers were used to record wall vibration generated by flow of particles and bubbles through the bed at various operating pressures and initial particle sizes. Time and frequency domains and state space methods were applied to analyze the experimental data. These methods were able to detect the agglomeration only when the bed has become defluidized. Analyzing the experimental data by the <b>S-test</b> showed that changes in the particle size due to agglomeration can be detected at least 4 degrees C before defluidization of the bed.

When R is complete, I is also `closed under taking test ideals', in the following sense: for each proper ideal C in I, it turns out that R/C is again F-pure, and if J and K are the unique ideals of R that contain C and are such that J/C is the (tight closure) test ideal of R/C and K/C is the big test ideal of R/C, then both J and K belong to I.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the effects of an 8 -week dry land hockey training program on off- and on-ice performance in adult recreational hockey athletes (n = 25). Each week, the athletes attended two dry-land sessions that consisted of a general warm-up, a dynamic warm-up, speed and agility drills, and strength training. They were also assigned weekly “homework”. Participants were pre- and post-tested for changes in vertical jump (cm) 4 -jump average, long jump (cm), push-ups (reps), bent knee v-ups (reps), and an on-ice 35 m sprint (sec) and Cornering S test (sec). Paired t-tests with Bonferoni corrections for multiple testing were used to assess changes. Eighteen participants (72 % female and 28 % male; 39. 39 + 6. 61 yrs), with an 80 % attendance rate for the sessions, and 50 % homework completion took part in pre- and post-tests. Athletes significantly improved their scores in long jump (+ 53. 10 cm), bent knee V-ups (+ 7. 00 reps), and push-ups (+ 5. 07 reps) for off-ice tests, and they significantly improved their cornering <b>s-test</b> scores for on-ice tests. The intensity of the workouts, the group setting, and the hockey specific exercises were all aspects of the program that the athletes enjoyed. Recommendations for improvement included having the program during the off-season rather than pre- and in-season, and using a more hockey specific general warm-up. This study demonstrates that dryland hockey training may result in increased horizontal jumping ability (long jump), core strength (v-ups), and upper body strength (push-ups) off the ice, and enhanced agility (cornering <b>s-test)</b> on the ice.

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{purification}} of human basic and near-neutral liver, and human basic and acidic lung glutathione S-transferases (GSH <b>S-T)</b> was undertaken. Purification {{of the basic}} and near-neutral GSH <b>S-T</b> was achieved {{using a combination of}} affinity chromatography, chromatofocusing and immunoaffinity chromatography. Affinity and ion exchange chromatography were employed in the purification of the basic and acidic lung forms. The purified proteins had similar physicochemical characteristics to the GSH <b>S-T</b> purified by others. The binding of 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene (CDNB) to the 3 classes of human GSH <b>S-T,</b> viz. basic, near-neutral and acidic and the effects of such binding, if any, were examined. Human acidic lung GSH <b>S-T</b> is irreversibly inactivated by CDNB {{in the absence of the}} co-substrate glutathione (GSH). The time-dependent inactivation is pseudo-first order and demonstrates saturation kinetics, suggesting that inactivation occurs from an EI complex. GSH protects the enzyme against CDNB inactivation. In contrast, the basic and near-neutral GSH <b>S-T</b> are not significantly inactivated by CDNB. Incubation with [¹⁴C]-CDNB indicated covalent binding to all 3 classes of GSH <b>S-T.</b> When the basic and acidic GSH <b>S-T</b> were incubated with [¹⁴C]-CDNB and GSH, cleaved with cyanogen bromide, and chromatographed by HPLC, a single peptide fraction was found to be labelled in both classes. Incubation in the absence of GSH yielded 1 and 2 additional labelled peptide fractions for the basic and acidic transferases, respectively. These results suggest that while CDNB arylates all 3 classes of human GSH <b>S-T,</b> only the acidic GSH <b>S-T</b> possesses a specific GSH-sensitive CDNB binding site, which when occupied leads to time-dependent inactivation of the enzyme. The tissue distribution and localization of the 3 classes of human GSH <b>S-T</b> in normal and tumour tissue was examined. Antibodies to representatives of the 3 classes were raised in rabbits, and radial immunodiffusion employed to quantitate their concentrations in the cytosol of 18 organs from 9 individuals. The data provide the first direct, quantitative evidence for the inter-individual and inter-organ variation suggested by earlier workers. The absence of the near-neutral GSH <b>S-T</b> in 5 of the 9 individuals studied confirms an earlier suggestion of a "null" allele for this transferase. Basic and acidic GSH <b>S-T</b> (apart from in a single liver), were always present. Near-neutral GSH <b>S-T,</b> when present, were found in all tissues examined. The marked inter-organ and inter-individual variation observed in this study may explain individual and organ susceptibility to drugs, toxins and carcinogens.

Sport in South Africa holds a position of great prominence and has been used in many instances to facilitate national unity and pride. Rugby Union {{is one of the most}} prominent sports in South Africa and it is in this sport that South Africa has achieved a great measure of success, both historically and currently. It is a sport in which the future sustainability of this success is high on the agenda. There have been a number of studies on talent identification in rugby and this study aims to contribute to that body of knowledge. To achieve this contribution, this study has two primary goals and aims. This study has as its primary goals and aims: 1) to have a sound theoretical base provided by in-depth and up to date research that will form the foundation for, 2) reviewed and alternative sport and position-specific testing protocols as well as comparative results consisting of norms and scores that will adequately identify and select those capable of participating in elite age-group rugby union. Contained in the theoretical base of this study is a review of the physical parameters required to succeed in sport, a discussion of the nature vs. nurture debate and a review of the developmental approaches to talent and ability. Other factors such as psychological skills, abilities and attributes and a historical review of talent identification models and approaches world-wide as well as in South Africa have also been provided. In all, the first primary aim and goal of this study has therefore successfully been achieved. Thereafter, the reviewed and alternative test protocol has been presented, discussed and executed, followed by an analysis of the results obtained. Specific achievements of this study are that new and modified tests (3 x 5 x 22 m Anaerobic capacity test, <b>S-Test</b> and the Kick-for-distance and accuracy test) for talent have been developed and that specific scores and norms for these new tests, as well as other pre-existing tests, have been established for future reference. In noting the success of the alternative, broad-position specific protocol and the establishment of scores and norms, the second primary goal and aim of this study can be said to be achieved. This study then ends with conclusions and further proposed recommendations. It can therefore be concluded with a great amount of certainty that this study has been successful not only in presenting as up to date research as possible in the fields of excellence and elite sport, but that furthermore, this study has provided a robust test protocol with comparative norms that can be used as an alternative {{identification and}} selection tool.

40|$|Fusing two phenalenyl units {{such that}} a Kekulé {{structure}} is obtained leads to ‘biradicaloid’ systems, which typically display low singlet–triplet (<b>S–T)</b> energy gaps. The {{value of the}} <b>S–T</b> gap in biradicaloids can be lowered by extending the conjugated system for an additional fused ring(s). Recently, we have described an alternative approach to decrease the <b>S–T</b> gap {{with the aid of}} through-space interactions that arise in helically twisted biradicaloids. Using [5]helicene-based biradicaloid ‘cethrene’ as an illustrative example, we have shown that the value of its <b>S–T</b> gap is substantially decreased when compared to that of its planar isomer heptazethrene, on account of the helical twist, inducing crucial intramolecular interactions...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of finding small <b>s-t</b> {{separators}} that induce graphs having certain properties. It is known that finding a minimum clique <b>s-t</b> separator is polynomial-time solvable (Tarjan in Discrete Math. 55 : 221 - 232, 1985), while for example the problems of finding a minimum <b>s-t</b> separator that induces a connected graph or forms an independent set are fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized {{by the size of}} the separator (Marx et al. in ACM Trans. Algorithms 9 (4) : 30, 2013). Motivated by these results, we study properties that generalize cliques, independent sets, and connected graphs, and determine the complexity of finding separators satisfying these properties. We investigate these problems also on bounded-degree graphs. Our results are as follows: (1) Finding a minimum c-connected <b>s-t</b> separator is FPT for c= 2 and W[1]-hard for any c≥ 3. (2) Finding a minimum <b>s-t</b> separator with diameter at most d is W[1]-hard for any d≥ 2. (3) Finding a minimum r-regular <b>s-t</b> separator is W[1]-hard for any r≥ 1. (4) For any decidable graph property, finding a minimum <b>s-t</b> separator with this property is FPT parameterized jointly {{by the size of the}} separator and the maximum degree. (5) Finding a connected <b>s-t</b> separator of minimum size does not have a polynomial kernel, even when restricted to graphs of maximum degree at most 3, unless {Mathematical expression}. In order to prove (1), we show that the natural c-connected generalization of the well-known Steiner Tree problem is FPT for c= 2 and W[1]-hard for any c≥ 3. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a new approach to}} computing an approximately maximum <b>s-t</b> flow in a capaci-tated, undirected graph. This flow is computed by solving a sequence of electrical flow problems. Each electrical flow is given by the solution of a system of linear equations in a Laplacian matrix, and thus may be approximately computed in nearly-linear time. Using this approach, we develop the fastest known algorithm for computing approximately maximum <b>s-t</b> flows. For a graph having n vertices and m edges, our algorithm computes a (1 −) -approximately maximum <b>s-t</b> flow in time 1 Õ mn 1 / 3 − 11 / 3. A dual version of our approach computes a (1 +) -approximately minimum <b>s-t</b> cut in time Õ m+ n 4 / 3 − 8 / 3, which is the fastest known algorithm for this problem as well. Previously, the best dependence on m and n was achieved by the algorithm of Goldberg and Rao (J.

40|$|This {{study has}} {{examined}} {{the expression of the}} glutathione S-transferases (GSH <b>S-T)</b> in fetal rat livers in order to provide more information about the role played by this important group of enzymes in the fetus. The study commenced with an examination of the subunit composition of adult and fetal rat liver GSH <b>S-T</b> using affinity chromatography followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulphate. Adult livers contained four major GSH <b>S-T</b> subunits. An additional and previously unidentified subunit was detected in fetal livers. This subunit, which differed from that found in rat placenta, had a Mᵣ of approximately 25 500. Densitometric measurements suggest that the newly detected subunit accounts for as much as 26 % of the GSH <b>S-T</b> in fetal livers. The novel fetal isoenzyme comprising this subunit was purified using a combination of affinity chromatography, carboxymethyl-cellulose column chromatography and chromatofocusing. The six major basic rat liver GSH <b>S-T</b> were purified for reference and comparative purposes. The fetal isoenzyme is composed of two non-identical subunits, namely, subunit Yc (Mᵣ 28 000) and the fetal subunit referred to as 'Yfetus'· The enzyme which I have termed GSH S-transferase Yc Y fetus has an isoelectric point of approximately 8. 65 and has GSH <b>S-T</b> activity towards a number of substrates. Significantly, the fetal isoenzyme {{has one of the highest}} glutathione peroxidase activities yet described for the purified rat liver GSH <b>S-T</b> towards the model substrate, cumene hydroperoxide. Kinetic studies reveal that the fetal isoenzyme has a catalytic efficiency for the peroxide substrate which is four fold higher than that of the adult rat liver isoenzyme, GSH <b>S-T</b> YcYc. The in vitro effect of the GSH <b>S-T</b> substrate and teratogen, acrolein, on this fetal isoenzyme was investigated and compared with acrolein's effect on some of the adult rat liver GSH <b>S-T</b> isoenzymes in the standard 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene assay. Surprisingly, acrolein was identified as a non-competitive inhibitor of the GSH <b>S-T.</b> Exposure to acrolein in various guises could therefore result in inhibition of the fetal isoenzyme and its subsequent failure in inhibiting lipid peroxidation. Inhibitor studies were performed to look at the effect of acrolein, as well as other substrate and non-substrate ligands, on the glutathione peroxidase activity of GSH <b>S-T</b> YcY fetus and YcYc. The glutathione peroxidase activity of the fetal isoenzyme was far less susceptible to acrolein inhibition than the YcYc isoenzyme and the fetal isoenzyme was found to retain significant glutathione peroxidase activity despite saturating concentrations of non-substrate ligand. This study suggests that the fetal isoenzyme serves a specific function in protecting fetuses against the possible teratogenic effects of organic peroxides...|$|R
