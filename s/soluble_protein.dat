5|$|An {{important}} role of EFS as a CAS-family member function is transmission of integrin-initiated signals from the extracellular matrix to downstream effectors, leading to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and changes in motility and invasion. The SH3 domain {{is a point of}} contact with polyproline sequences on focal adhesion kinase (FAK). or the related kinase PTK2B, also known as RAFTK/Pyk2/CAKβ. Typically, phosphorylation of the C-terminal region of CAS proteins by FAK or PTK2B creates a binding site for the SH2 domain of a SRC-family protein, which then hyper-phosphorylates the substrate domain, allowing the CAS protein to function as a scaffold for other proteins including CRK proteins and C3G, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for RAP1. PTP-PEST, a <b>soluble</b> <b>protein</b> tyrosine phosphatase that is ubiquitously expressed in mice both during embryonic development and in adult tissues, opposes FAK and PTK2B activity, as it dephosphorylates PTK2B, FAK and CAS family members, among other proteins. The PTP-PEST proline-rich sequence 332PPKPPR337 has been shown to interact directly with the SH3 domain of members of EFS and another CAS protein, NEDD9.|$|E

25|$|Another {{study from}} Zhejiang University {{examined}} the nutritional value of broccoli after five common cooking techniques; steaming, boiling, microwaving, stir-frying and stir-frying followed by deep frying. The {{study found that}} the two most common methods of home cooking in China, stir-frying and stir-frying combined with deep frying in soybean oil, resulted in a much greater loss of chlorophyll, <b>soluble</b> <b>protein,</b> soluble sugar and vitamin C. The method which affected these values the least was steaming. Stir frying for five minutes and stir frying combined with boiling caused the highest loss of glucosinolates which according to this study are best preserved by steaming. A study performed by the Spanish National Research Counsel stir fried the broccoli for only 3 minutes 30 seconds and found that nutritional value of these broccoli samples varied depending on which cooking oil was used. Comparing these results to an uncooked sample, the study found that phenolics and vitamin C were reduced more than glucosinolates and minerals. Stir-frying with soybean, peanut, safflower or extra virgin olive did not reduce glucosinolates, and broccoli stir-fried with extra virgin olive oil or sunflower oil had vitamin C levels similar to uncooked broccoli. These levels were significantly lower with other edible oils.|$|E

40|$|The {{complete}} {{distribution of}} total <b>soluble</b> <b>proteins</b> {{was investigated in}} 40 -year-old oak and beech trees, felled at two dates (October 1999 and June 2000), to estimate seasonal variations in protein content at tree level. The concentration of total <b>soluble</b> <b>proteins</b> was nearly twice as high in oak compared to beech (755 mg. g- 1 Dry Mass vs. 4. 2 mg. g- 1 Dry Mass, respectively) and 10 times lower than total non structural carbohydrates. Scaling from samples to total tree biomass, the contribution of C stored as total <b>soluble</b> <b>proteins</b> accounted for 500 gC in oak trees and only for 250 gC in beech trees. The stem was the major storage compartment in both species. <b>Soluble</b> <b>proteins</b> made up most of nitrogen at the stem and roots of oaks, while in its branches and in all beech organs, several N compounds predominated. These concentrations varied before bud break and stem growth in oak and beech. The seasonal progression of total <b>soluble</b> <b>proteins</b> in twigs of both species showed opposite patterns, especially during Spring, probably due to internal redistribution of proteins from upper stem and large branches. The dates of minimum and maximum concentrations were different for total <b>soluble</b> <b>proteins</b> and total non structural carbohydrates...|$|R
40|$|This {{study focused}} on the {{extraction}} and physicochemical characterization of proteins from larvae and larvaemeal of Tenebrio molitor. The larvae were subjected to a protein extraction process which involved a thermo-me-chanical pre-treatment to produce the larvae meal. <b>Soluble</b> <b>proteins</b> from larvae and from larvae meal were sub-sequently extracted by solubilisation at an alkaline pH. The products obtained were then characterized andcompared. The larvae and larvae meal were rich in protein (65. 6 % and 71. 6 % respectively) and displayed goodessential amino acid (EAA) profiles. They contained all EAA and in sufficient quantities to meet the dietary re-quirements of both humans and salmon, except for a deficiency in methionine. The EAA profile of the larvaemealwas also {{comparable to those of}} fish and soya meals used for feed. At pH 10 and 45 °C, the protein extraction yield of larvae (59. 9 %) was two-fold that of larvae meal (26. 4 %).

40|$|AbstractAmong polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine), spermine {{specifically}} induces cataract in {{an organ}} cultured lens. Spermine uptake nearly paralleled the cataract formation. When polyamines {{were added to}} lens <b>soluble</b> <b>proteins,</b> spermine specifically induced turbidity. When lens <b>soluble</b> <b>proteins</b> were separated by gel chromatography, heavy-molecular-weight protein (HMW, high molecular form of α-crystallin) and proteins between βH- and βL-crystallin fractions reacted with spermine and aggregated. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the aggregated proteins showed that 43 -kDa lens protein was commonly observed in both aggregates. Spermine-affinity chromatography of the total <b>soluble</b> <b>proteins</b> showed the binding of HMW protein to the gel and the chromatogram of the second turbidity peak in the gel chromatography showed the binding of 43 -kDa protein.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to simplify a complex mixture of <b>soluble</b> <b>proteins</b> from Escherichia coli, methods to {{fractionate}} the samples prior to two-dimensional (2 D) gel electrophoresis were developed. These methods involve the use of DEAE-Sepharose, SP-Sepharose, and phenyl Sepharose chromatographic columns and the fractionation of the protein mixtures based on differential anionic, cationic, and hydrophobic properties of the proteins, respectively. Fractionation of the <b>soluble</b> <b>proteins</b> from an E. coli extract with DEAE-Sepharose resulted in a threefold {{increase in the number}} of detectable 2 D gel spots. These gel spots were amenable to protein identification by using in-gel trypsin digestions, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and peptide mass fingerprinting. Significantly, the DEAE-Sepharose column fractionation effectively partitioned the <b>soluble</b> <b>proteins</b> from the cell extracts. Similarly, an SP-Sepharose column was used to fractionate the <b>soluble</b> <b>proteins</b> from E. coli and resulted in over a twofold {{increase in the number of}} detectable gel spots. Lastly, fractionation of the cell extract with the phenyl Sepharose column resulted in a threefold increase in the number of detectable 2 D gel spots.

40|$|Helix packing is {{important}} in the folding, stability, and association of membrane proteins. Packing analysis of the helical portions of 7 integral membrane <b>proteins</b> and 37 <b>soluble</b> <b>proteins</b> show that the helices in membrane proteins have higher packing values (0. 431) than in <b>soluble</b> <b>proteins</b> (0. 405). The highest packing values in integral membrane proteins originate from small hydrophobic (G and A) and small hydroxyl-containing (S and T) amino acids, whereas in <b>soluble</b> <b>proteins</b> large hydrophobic and aromatic residues have the highest packing values. The highest packing values for membrane proteins are found in the transmembrane helix–helix interfaces. Glycine and alanine have the highest occurrence among the buried amino acids in membrane proteins, whereas leucine and alanine are the most common buried residue in <b>soluble</b> <b>proteins.</b> These observations are consistent with a shorter axial separation between helices in membrane proteins.
