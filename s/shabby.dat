5|$|After being {{purchased}} by the Guellers in 2004, the restaurant was redecorated and modernised, the décor having become <b>shabby</b> under previous owners. The new decorations included recessed lighting and fabric-covered walls. There is a fireplace in {{the centre of the}} dining room, with an 18th-century settle (a type of bench) beside it. Elements from the Reid and Long era remain, with the bar and ceilings still being recognisable from their time at the restaurant.|$|E
5|$|Best {{remembered the}} Indra {{as being a}} {{depressing}} place that {{was filled with a}} few tourists, and having heavy, old, red curtains that made it seem <b>shabby</b> compared to the larger Kaiserkeller, a club also owned by Koschmider and located nearby at 36 Grosse Freiheit. After the closure of the Indra because of complaints about the noise, the Beatles played in the Kaiserkeller, starting on 4 October 1960.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{depressing}} sections of Chicago is the Uptown area on the North Side. <b>Shabby</b> apartment buildings, vacant stores, wino bars, littered vacant lots, junkies, muggers, and career down-and-outers. It also has a new alderman, Helen Shiller, {{and she has a}} vision of what that seedy old neighborhood should be in the future. And apparently her vision is that Uptown should remain a seedy old neighborhood.|$|E

5|$|The Intelligence Directorate {{was formed}} in 1985 to oversee special operations. It had four subcommittees: the Committee for Special Missions, the Foreign Intelligence Committee, the Counterespionage Committee and the Lebanon Committee. Led by Abd al-Rahman Isa, the longest-serving member of the ANO—Seale writes that Isa was unshaven and <b>shabby,</b> but charming and persuasive—the {{directorate}} maintained 30–40 people overseas who looked after the ANO's arms caches in various countries. It trained staff, arranged passports and visas, and reviewed security at airports and seaports. Members {{were not allowed to}} visit each other at home, and no one outside the directorate was supposed to know who was a member.|$|E
5|$|Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) revives {{the student}} {{newspaper}} The Muckraker. She wants to publish libel about the McKinley High glee club to cause {{conflict between the}} club's members and destroy it from within. Brittany's (Heather Morris) new internet talk show—"Fondue for Two"—gives the newspaper some grist when she seems to out Santana (Naya Rivera) on it. Santana berates Brittany for her ill-chosen words, and Finn (Cory Monteith) nearly comes to blows with Sam (Chord Overstreet) over another item that pairs Sam and Finn's girlfriend Quinn (Dianna Agron). Although Quinn and Sam both deny dating, Finn plans a stakeout with Rachel's help {{to see if it}} is true. Their surveillance of a <b>shabby</b> motel instead finds Sam and Kurt (Chris Colfer) leaving a room, after which Sam goes back inside alone.|$|E
5|$|His parents' {{marriage}} {{dissolved in}} July 1888, when Max Döblin eloped with Henriette Zander, a seamstress twenty years his junior, {{and moved to}} America {{to start a new}} life. The catastrophic loss of his father was a central event in Döblin's childhood and would be formative for his later life. Shortly thereafter, in October 1888, Sophie and the five children moved to Berlin and took up residence in a small <b>shabby</b> apartment on the Blumenstraße in Berlin's working-class east. Döblin's parents briefly reconciled in 1889, when Max returned penniless from America; the family moved to Hamburg in April 1889, {{but when it came to}} light that Max had brought his lover back with him and was leading a double life, Sophie and the children returned to Berlin in September 1889.|$|E

60|$|Sheila, {{with her}} husband's luncheon tray, brought also her farewells. Lawford surveyed, {{not without a}} faint, shy {{stirring}} of incredulity, the superbly restrained presence.

5|$|Milton Hay desired {{that his}} nephew go to Washington as a {{qualified}} attorney, and John Hay {{was admitted to}} the bar in Illinois on February 4, 1861. On February 11, he embarked with President-elect Lincoln on a circuitous journey to Washington. By this time, several Southern states had seceded to form the Confederate States of America in reaction to the election of Lincoln, seen as an opponent of slavery. When Lincoln was sworn in on March 4, Hay and Nicolay moved into the White House, sharing a <b>shabby</b> bedroom. As there was only authority for payment of one presidential secretary (Nicolay), Hay was appointed to a post in the Interior Department at $1,600 per year, seconded to service at the White House. They were available to Lincoln 24 hours a day. As Lincoln took no vacations as president and worked seven days a week, often until 11 pm (or later, during crucial battles) the burden on his secretaries was heavy.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles first {{played a}} full show with Best on 17 August 1960 at the Indra club in Hamburg, {{and the group}} slept in the Bambi Kino cinema in a small, dirty room with bunk beds, a cold and noisy former {{storeroom}} directly behind the screen. Upon first seeing the Indra, where they were booked to play, Best remembered it as a depressing place filled with a few tourists, and having heavy, old, red curtains that made it seem <b>shabby</b> compared to the larger Kaiserkeller. As Best {{had been the only}} group member to study O-Level German at school, he could talk with the club's owner, Bruno Koschmider, and the clientele. After the Indra closed due to complaints about the noise, the group started a residency in the Kaiserkeller.|$|E
5|$|The album's {{original}} cover art by Burton Silverman features a watercolour {{portrait of a}} long-haired, bearded man in <b>shabby</b> clothes. The idea for the cover came from a photograph Anderson's wife took of a homeless man on Thames Embankment, and Anderson later felt {{it would have been}} better to have used the photograph rather than commission the painting. Ian Anderson recalls posing for a photograph for the painting, though Silverman claims it was a self-portrait. The artwork was commissioned and purchased by Chrysalis Records head Terry Ellis. Artist Silverman claims the art was only licensed for use as an album cover, and not for merchandising; and approached the band seeking remuneration for its further use. Silverman and Anderson have different accounts of level of enmity involved in this. The original artwork for both the front and back covers are now privately owned by an unknown family, apparently having been stolen from a London hotel room.|$|E

[...] He did not state who he alleged hired Weiner or offer any evidence that Weiner had been hired. To an interviewer, Said said, [...] "I was born in Jerusalem; my family is a Jerusalem family. We left Palestine in 1947. We left before most others. It was a fortuitous thing... I never said I was a refugee, but the rest of my family was. My entire extended family was driven out." ...|$|R
5|$|The name Malkin {{has several}} {{possible}} derivations: {{it was a}} familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or <b>shabby</b> woman; the similar mawkin was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut. Malkin was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in grimalkin or grey malkin, and was an old northern English name for a hare, into which witches {{were said to be}} able to transfigure. It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of mal and kin as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower, which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time. Another possibility is a corruption of malt kiln, which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.|$|E
5|$|With through running {{between the}} lines in place, in June 1899 the MR {{inspected}} the O's carriages and locomotives, and had serious concerns. The original passenger carriage began as a horse tram and was <b>shabby</b> internally, and unsafe {{as part of a}} longer train. The passenger carriage from the 1870s was in a poor condition. The 1895 Bristol passenger carriages were unfit owing to their light construction. Eight of the O's nine goods wagons did not comply with Railway Clearing House standards and could not be used on other lines. On 4 October 1899 the MR loaned the O an eight-wheeled 70seat passenger carriage. As this had been built for the MR's standard height platforms rather than the O's low platforms, 80–100ft (24–30m) of each platform on the Tramway was raised to standard height to accommodate the MR carriage.|$|E

When a farmer who hasn't much money loafs about the poolroom and lies on his back, smoking, it's plain that he's taking {{advantage}} of somebody else.

60|$|In {{charge of}} this man, a slim youth, with a very bad complexion, we climbed a narrow {{stairway}} (which grew geometrically <b>shabbier</b> as we rose) until, at last, we came into a room so near the roof that it could afford only half-windows--but as we were getting the chamber at half-price we could not complain.|$|R

2500|$|Cricket writer, Colin Bateman, noted [...] "Fletcher {{was a tough}} cookie, {{a shrewd}} man who could bluff opponents like the most disarming of poker players.

Bateman added [...] "the sacking of Fletcher as England captain remains one of English cricket's <b>shabbiest</b> sagas".|$|R

50|$|Trouble {{intervenes}} when a legal technicality {{threatens the}} contract with Buddy Hare. Though {{it appears to be}} based on an honest mistake by Lash, Vic uses cruel innuendo about Lash's childhood and implied backmail to get the agent to agree to absorb the large loss he will face making good. Vic immediately regrets the tactic, and Lash's wounded demeanor makes him feel even <b>shabbier.</b>|$|R
25|$|Between May 1839 and February 1840 Fraser's {{published}} the work sometimes considered Thackeray's first novel, Catherine. Originally {{intended as a}} satire of the Newgate school of crime fiction, it ended up being more of a picaresque tale.

25|$|There were {{problems}} with Oliver Smith's designs. His painted backdrops were stunning, but the sets were, {{for the most}} part, either <b>shabby</b> looking or too stylized.

25|$|The {{character}} clown makeup is a comic slant on {{the standard}} human face. Their makeup starts with a flesh tone base and may make use of anything from glasses, mustaches and beards to freckles, warts, big ears or strange haircuts. The most prevalent character clown in the American circus is the tramp or hobo clown with a thick five-o'clock shadow and wearing <b>shabby,</b> crumpled garments.|$|E
