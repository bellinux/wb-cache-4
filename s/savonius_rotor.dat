The VAWT is regarded as the most suitable elegant candidate to be integrated with buildings for its relatively low operating noise, easy maintenance, and easy access. This study explored the interaction effect of the overlap ratio, phase-shift, and stage on the performance of the <b>Savonius</b> <b>rotors</b> in details. The results show that appropriate choice of the phase-shift angle according to the overlap ratio can not only increase the power coefficient of the <b>Savonius</b> <b>rotors</b> but also eliminate the negative static torque and smooth the variation of the static torque coefficient. Moreover, the performance of the two-stage rotors indicates that the two-stage rotor is the best candidate for this type of wind turbines or as a starting assistant for the Darrieus rotors.

The coefficient of power at a higher Reynolds number experienced in the field trials is estimated by extrapolating the results at a lower Reynolds number. The discharge for these modified <b>Savonius</b> <b>rotors</b> is estimated from the mathematical models developed for roto-dynamic and piston pumps at design wind velocities of 6 and 8. 5 m/sec.

5000|$|The Savonius turbine {{is one of}} the {{simplest}} turbines. Aerodynamically, it is a drag-type device, consisting of two or three scoops. Looking down on the rotor from above, a two-scoop machine would look like an [...] "S" [...] shape in cross section. Because of the curvature, the scoops experience less drag when moving against the wind than when moving with the wind. The differential drag causes the Savonius turbine to spin. Because they are drag-type devices, Savonius turbines extract much less of the wind's power than other similarly-sized lift-type turbines. Much of the swept area of a <b>Savonius</b> <b>rotor</b> may be near the ground, if it has a small mount without an extended post, making the overall energy extraction less effective due to the lower wind speeds found at lower heights.|$|E

To improve its performance, parameters such flow pattern, pressure and velocity in different conditions must be analyzed. For this purpose, a detailed description on the flow field of various types of <b>Savonius</b> <b>rotors</b> is required.
