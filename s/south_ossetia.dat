5|$|On 9 September 2008, Russia {{announced}} that its troops in <b>South</b> <b>Ossetia</b> and Abkhazia would remain under bilateral agreements with their respective de facto governments. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov {{said that a}} military presence in Abkhazia and <b>South</b> <b>Ossetia</b> was essential to prevent Georgia from regaining control. Georgia considers Abkhazia and <b>South</b> <b>Ossetia</b> Russian-occupied territories. In November 2011, the European Parliament passed a resolution recognising Abkhazia and <b>South</b> <b>Ossetia</b> as occupied Georgian territories.|$|E

5|$|Russia {{deliberately}} attacked fleeing {{civilians in}} <b>South</b> <b>Ossetia</b> and the Gori district of Georgia. Russian warplanes bombed civilian population centres in Georgia proper and villages of ethnic Georgians in <b>South</b> <b>Ossetia.</b> Armed militias engaged in looting, arson attacks and abductions, forcing Georgian civilians to flee.|$|E

50|$|In 2005, Georgia accused Russia of the {{annexation}} of its internationally recognized territory. Russian officials had {{de facto control}} of <b>South</b> <b>Ossetia's</b> institutions, including security institutions and forces; <b>South</b> <b>Ossetia's</b> de facto government was largely staffed with Russians and South Ossetians with Russian passports, who had occupied equivalent government positions in Russia. Reuters reported that before the war, Russia supplied two-thirds of <b>South</b> <b>Ossetia's</b> annual budget, and that Russia's state-controlled gas giant Gazprom was building new gas pipelines and infrastructure worth of 15 billion Russian rubles there.|$|R
5|$|Russia saw the Black Sea {{coast and}} {{the border with}} Turkey as {{invaluable}} strategic attributes of Georgia. Russia had more vested interests in Abkhazia than in <b>South</b> <b>Ossetia,</b> since the Russian military presence on the Black Sea coast was seen as vital to Russian influence in the Black Sea. Before the early 2000s, <b>South</b> <b>Ossetia</b> was originally intended {{as a tool to}} retain a grip on Georgia.|$|E
5|$|In early March 2008, Abkhazia and <b>South</b> <b>Ossetia</b> {{submitted}} formal {{requests for}} their recognition to Russia's parliament {{shortly after the}} West's recognition of Kosovo to which Russia was opposed. Dmitry Rogozin, Russian ambassador to NATO, warned that Georgia's NATO membership aspirations would cause Russia to support the independence of Abkhazia and <b>South</b> <b>Ossetia.</b> The Russian State Duma adopted a resolution on 21 March, in which it called on the President of Russia and the government to consider the recognition.|$|E
5|$|In late June, Russian {{military}} expert Pavel Felgenhauer predicted that Vladimir Putin would start {{a war against}} Georgia in Abkhazia and <b>South</b> <b>Ossetia</b> supposedly in August. The Kavkaz Center reported in early July that Chechen separatists had intelligence data that Russia was preparing a military operation against Georgia in August–September 2008 which mainly aimed to expel Georgian forces from the Kodori Gorge; this would be followed by the expulsion of Georgian units and population from <b>South</b> <b>Ossetia.</b>|$|E

The South Ossetians destroyed most ethnic Georgian villages in <b>South</b> <b>Ossetia</b> and were responsible for an ethnic cleansing of Georgians. Russia recognised the independence of Abkhazia and <b>South</b> <b>Ossetia</b> from Georgia on 26 August; in response, the Georgian government severed diplomatic relations with Russia. Russia mostly completed its withdrawal of troops from undisputed parts of Georgia on 8 October. In the aftermath, Russia's international relations were largely unharmed. The war displaced 192,000 people and while many returned to their homes after the war, 20,272 people, mostly ethnic Georgians, remained displaced as of 2014.
