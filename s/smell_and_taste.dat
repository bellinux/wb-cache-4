5|$|Pholiota flammans fruit bodies bear no {{distinctive}} <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> mild {{to slightly}} bitter. Opinions are divided {{as to its}} edibility, however, as some authors regard the mushroom as inedible, while others consider it edible or of unknown edibility.|$|E
5|$|After drying, the {{harvested}} stems or rhizomes were steamed for 24 {{hours or}} more in the umu tī pit. Steaming converted the carbohydrate fructan in the stems to very sweet fructose. The cooked stems or rhizomes were then ﬂattened by beating and carried back to villages for storage. Kāuru could be stored dry until {{the time came to}} add it to fern root and other foods to improve their palatability. The sugar in the stems or rhizomes would be partially crystallised, and could be found mixed in a sugary pulp with other matter between the fibres of the root, which were easily separated by tearing them apart. Kāuru could also be dipped in water and chewed, and was said to <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> like molasses.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit body}} of Tricholoma pardinum is an {{imposing}} mushroom with a pale grey cap up to 15cm (6in) in diameter that {{is covered with}} dark brownish to greyish scales. The gills are whitish, and are not attached to the stout white to pale grey-brown stalk. The spore print is white. One of the more toxic members of the genus Tricholoma, the species has been implicated {{in a number of}} episodes of mushroom poisoning, probably because it is a large, attractive mushroom with a pleasant <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> <b>taste,</b> and it bears a superficial resemblance to several edible species, like Tricholoma terreum. Ingesting T.pardinum—even in small quantities—results in a severe, persistent gastroenteritis caused by an unknown mycotoxin.|$|E

5|$|Like other insects, flies have chemoreceptors that detect <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> <b>taste,</b> and mechanoreceptors that {{respond to}} touch. The third {{segments}} of the antennae and the maxillary palps bear the main olfactory receptors, while the gustatory receptors are in the labium, pharynx, feet, wing margins and female genitalia, enabling flies to taste their food by walking on it. The taste receptors in females {{at the tip of}} the abdomen receive information on the suitability of a site for ovipositing. Flies that feed on blood have special sensory structures that can detect infrared emissions, and use them to home in on their hosts, and many blood-sucking flies can detect the raised concentration of carbon dioxide that occurs near large animals. Some tachinid flies (Ormiinae) which are parasitoids of bush crickets, have sound receptors to help them locate their singing hosts.|$|E
5|$|Tricholoma pardinum is one {{of several}} {{poisonous}} members of the genus Tricholoma; its large size, fleshy appearance, and pleasant <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> add to the risk of it being accidentally consumed. It was responsible for over 20 percent of cases of mushroom poisoning in Switzerland {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. Many cases of poisoning arise in the Jura Mountains. Eating it causes highly unpleasant gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea, dizziness, vomiting, and diarrhea. These arise 15minutes to 2hours after consumption and often persist for several hours; complete recovery usually takes 4 to 6 days. Sweating and anxiety may be evident, and disturbance in liver function has been recorded. Cramping may occur in the calves. In one case, seven people and a cat suffered severe symptoms after sharing a meal that contained only two mushroom caps. The toxin, the identity of which is unknown, appears to cause a sudden inflammation of the mucous membranes lining the stomach and intestines.|$|E
25|$|Sensory {{nerves and}} the {{autonomic}} nervous system are generally unaffected, meaning {{the majority of people}} with ALS maintain hearing, sight, touch, <b>smell,</b> <b>and</b> <b>taste.</b>|$|E
50|$|Workers {{have complained}} of <b>smelling</b> <b>and</b> <b>tasting</b> JP-8 for hours after exposure. As JP-8 is less {{volatile}} than standard diesel fuel, it {{remains on the}} contaminated surfaces for longer time, increasing the risk of exposure.|$|R
50|$|The use of {{essential}} oils in pregnancy {{is not recommended}} due to inadequate published evidence to demonstrate evidence of safety. Pregnant women often report an abnormal sensitivity to <b>smells</b> <b>and</b> <b>taste,</b> <b>and</b> essential oils can cause irritation and nausea.|$|R

25|$|Where possible, a {{cleaned and}} freshly oiled Dutch oven should {{be stored in}} a clean, dry {{location}} with the lid ajar or off to promote air circulation and to avoid the <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> of rancid oil. If the Dutch oven must be stored with the lid on, a paper towel or piece of newspaper should be placed inside the oven to absorb any moisture.|$|E

25|$|Exteroceptive senses are {{senses that}} {{perceive}} the body's own position, motion, and state, known as proprioceptive senses. External senses include the traditional five: sight, hearing, touch, <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> <b>taste,</b> {{as well as}} thermoception (temperature differences) and possibly an additional weak magnetoception (direction). Proprioceptive senses include nociception (pain); equilibrioception (balance); proprioception (a sense of the position and movement of the parts of one's own body).|$|E
25|$|Snakes use smell {{to track}} their prey. They smell by using their forked tongues to collect {{airborne}} particles, then passing {{them to the}} vomeronasal organ or Jacobson's organ in the mouth for examination. The fork in the tongue gives snakes a sort of directional sense of <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> simultaneously. They keep their tongues constantly in motion, sampling particles from the air, ground, and water, analyzing the chemicals found, and determining the presence of prey or predators in the local environment. In water-dwelling snakes, such as the anaconda, the tongue functions efficiently underwater.|$|E
25|$|Various organic {{diseases}} {{may cause}} parosmias (distortion {{of the sense}} of smell). Also, since <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> are intimately linked senses, disorders of gustation (e.g. dysgeusia- taste dysfunction) can present as a complaint related to smell, and vice versa. These conditions, collectively termed chemosensory dysfunctions, are many and varied, and they may trigger a person to complain of an odor than is not present, however the diagnostic criteria for ORS require the exclusion of any such causes. They include pathology of the right hemisphere of the brain, substance abuse, arteriovenous malformations in the brain, and temporal lobe epilepsy.|$|E
50|$|Dolcelatte {{was created}} by the Galbani Company (now part of Groupe Lactalis) and the name is a {{registered}} trademark. Dolcelatte was developed for the British market to provide a milder <b>smelling</b> <b>and</b> <b>tasting</b> alternative to the famous traditional Italian blue cheese, Gorgonzola. It is sometimes referred to as Gorgonzola Dolce.|$|R

50|$|Both Nicholas Humphrey and Ross Honeywill {{believe that}} it is social intelligence, or the {{richness}} of our qualitative life, rather than our quantitative intelligence, that makes humans what they are; for example {{what it is like to}} be a human being living at the centre of the conscious present, surrounded by <b>smells</b> <b>and</b> <b>tastes</b> <b>and</b> feels and the sense of being an extraordinary metaphysical entity with properties which hardly seem to belong to the physical world. This is social intelligence.|$|R
25|$|Both smokers and non-smokers in Syria {{acknowledge}} that <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> are noteworthy appealing factors of the narghile. This {{mention of the}} narghile’s sensory appeal signifies {{the importance of the}} introduction of Maasel, a specially prepared fruit-flavored tobacco, in replacement of Ajami, a raw unflavored tobacco, in regard to the growing popularity of the narghile. The spread of Maasel in the 1990s produced a surge in popularity for narghile smoking. In addition to providing the pleasing aroma and taste, Maasel also simplifies the process of narghile preparation in comparison to the more complex process of preparing the traditional Ajami.|$|E
25|$|While Scheele's {{experiments}} generated substances {{which have}} long since {{been found to be}} hazardous, the compounds and elements he used to start his experiments were dangerous to begin with, especially heavy metals. Like most of his contemporaries, in an age where there were few methods of chemical characterisation, Scheele would <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> any new substances he discovered. Cumulative exposure to arsenic, mercury, lead, their compounds, and perhaps hydrofluoric acid which he had discovered, and other substances took their toll on Scheele, who died at the early age of 43, on 21 May 1786, at his home in Köping. Doctors said that he died of mercury poisoning.|$|E
25|$|Members of this genus are leathery, {{tough to}} kill and fake death. Since they are {{unpleasant}} to <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> <b>taste,</b> they are soon released by the predators, recover and fly off soon thereafter. The butterfly sequesters toxins from its food plants of the family Asclepiadaceae. The butterflies also congregate with other danaiines to sip from the sap of Crotalaria, Heliotropium and other plants which provide the pyrrolizidine alkaloids which they sequester. A study in north-eastern India showed a preference to foraging on Crotalaria juncea compared to Bauhinia purpurea, Barleria cristata rosea and Nerium oleander. To advertise their unpalatability, the butterfly has prominent markings with a striking colour pattern. The striped tiger is mimicked by both sexes of the Indian Tamil lacewing (Cethosia nietneri mahratta) and the leopard lacewing (Cethosia cyane) and females of the common palmfly (Elymnias hypermnestra).|$|E

50|$|Originally, {{paper cups}} for hot drinks were glued {{together}} and made waterproof by dropping {{a small amount}} of clay {{in the bottom of the}} cup, and then spinning at high speed so that clay would travel up the walls of the cup, making the paper water-resistant.

25|$|Spiny {{lobsters}} tend {{to live in}} crevices {{of rocks}} and coral reefs, only occasionally venturing out at night to seek snails, clams, sea-hares, crabs, or sea urchins to eat. Sometimes, they migrate in very large groups in long files of lobsters across the sea floor. These lines {{may be more than}} 50 lobsters long. Spiny lobsters navigate using the <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> of natural substances in the water that change {{in different parts of the}} ocean. It was recently discovered that spiny lobsters can also navigate by detecting the Earth's magnetic field. They keep together by contact, using their long antennae. Potential predators may be deterred from eating spiny lobsters by a loud screech made by the antennae of the spiny lobsters rubbing against a smooth part of the exoskeleton. Spiny lobsters usually exhibit the social habit of being together. However recent studies indicate that healthy lobsters move away from infected ones, leaving the diseased lobsters to fend for themselves.|$|E
25|$|Metaxa {{comes in}} nine major varieties: Three Stars, Five Stars, Five Stars Honey Shot, Seven Stars, Twelve stars, Grande Fine, Private Reserve, Angels Treasure and AEN. The number of stars {{represents}} {{the number of}} years the blend is matured. The three and 5 star are not as different, but the 5 star is notably drier, making the alcohol more pronounced. The seven and twelve star are more flavoursome and complex, while the Twelve-star G.O.R. is again more dry, in this case because there is no addition of wine. In either of the two latter varieties, the <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> of the barrel in which the brandy matured is noticeable. The house of Metaxa has recently launched a new product, the Metaxa Twelve Star containing distillates matured for 12 years adding Muscat wine from the island of Samos, unlike the Metaxa Twelve Stars Grand Olympian Reserve. Metaxa Private Reserve is the most oldest member of Metaxa family. Only 5.000 numbered decanters of Metaxa Private Reserve are on the market containing distillates aged for 30 years from Spyros Metaxas' family barrels.|$|E
500|$|The stout stalk may be white, pale grey or pale brown, and {{is thicker}} at the base. The {{texture of the}} stalk surface ranges from fibrillose (appearing {{to be made of}} coarse fibers {{arranged}} longitudinally) to more or less smooth, and the stalk base will stain a dirty brown to yellow colour when bruised. It is [...] high and [...] wide, with the base [...] in diameter, and bruises a dirty yellowish colour. There is no ring or volva. The flesh is whitish and has a pleasant mealy <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> <b>taste.</b> Variety filamentosum has a mealy odour and taste reminiscent of cucumber.|$|E
5000|$|Flavor in food is {{important}} in how food <b>smells</b> <b>and</b> <b>tastes</b> to the consumer, especially in sensory analysis. Some of these products occur naturally like salt and sugar, but flavor chemists (called a [...] "flavorist") develop many of these flavors for food products. Such artificial flavors include methyl salicylate which creates the wintergreen odor and lactic acid which gives milk a tart taste.|$|R

50|$|Weißbiers feature {{fermentation}} by-products such as esters (which lend fruity {{flavors and}} aromas), especially isoamyl acetate, reminiscent of bananas, and the phenolic compound guaiacol, a metabolite of ferulic acid, which <b>smells</b> <b>and</b> <b>tastes</b> like cloves. Other phenolics sometimes found in Weißbiers evoke medicinal or smoky sensations. The bittering level of most Weißbiers {{is close to}} 15 International Bitterness Units, a very low level. Hop flavor and aroma are typically low.|$|R
