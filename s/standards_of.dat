40|$|The {{specialization}} {{of forensic}} mental health assessment (FMHA) has incorporated important advances {{during the last}} two decades. As scientific advances, specialized tools, and relevant ethical guidelines have become core elements of FMHA, how-ever, {{the question of how to}} regulate poor practice has assumed increasing impor-tance. One such means of regulation that has been rarely applied to FMHA thus far is malpractice litigation using a clearly defined <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> care. This article focuses on the relationship between <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> practice and <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> care in FMHA. The authors discuss the current absence <b>of</b> a <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> care in FMHA, describing the historical, regulatory, and legal influences that have helped to shape the current state of practice in this specialty area and their relevance to operationalizing a <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> care. The authors address the various sources of authority that the law might consider in defining a <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> care and specify circumstances under which legal regulation using a <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> care would be more useful than would ethical/ professional regulation using a <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> practice. Finally, the authors describe the advantages of developing a clearer <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> practice in FMHA, which can then inform the operationalization <b>of</b> a <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> care...|$|R
