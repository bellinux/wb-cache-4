5|$|Biomes {{are larger}} units of {{organization}} that categorize {{regions of the}} Earth's ecosystems, mainly according to the <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> <b>composition</b> of vegetation. There are different methods to define the continental boundaries of biomes dominated by different functional types of vegetative communities that are limited in distribution by climate, precipitation, weather and other environmental variables. Biomes include tropical rainforest, temperate broadleaf and mixed forest, temperate deciduous forest, taiga, tundra, hot desert, and polar desert. Other researchers have recently categorized other biomes, such as the human and oceanic microbiomes. To a microbe, {{the human body is}} a habitat and a landscape. Microbiomes were discovered largely through advances in molecular genetics, which have revealed a hidden richness of microbial diversity on the planet. The oceanic microbiome plays {{a significant role in the}} ecological biogeochemistry of the planet's oceans.|$|E

25|$|Introduced grazing {{animals can}} also affect soil {{condition}} through physical compaction and break-up {{of the soil}} caused by the hooves of animals and through the erosion effects caused by the removal of protective plant cover. Such effects {{are most likely to}} occur on land subjected to repeated and heavy grazing. The effects of overstocking are often worst on soils of low fertility and in low rainfall areas below 500mm, as most soil nutrients in these areas tend to be concentrated in the surface so any movement of soils can lead to severe degradation. Alteration in soil structure and nutrient levels affects the establishment, growth and survival of plant species and in turn can lead to a change in woodland <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> <b>composition.</b>|$|E

25|$|Solar {{cells are}} {{commonly}} encapsulated in a transparent polymeric resin {{to protect the}} delicate solar cell regions for coming into contact with moisture, dirt, ice, and other conditions expected either during operation or when used outdoors. The encapsulants are commonly made from polyvinyl acetate or glass. Most encapsulants are uniform in <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> <b>composition,</b> which increases light collection owing to light trapping from total internal reflection of light within the resin. Research has been conducted into structuring the encapsulant to provide further collection of light. Such encapsulants have included roughened glass surfaces, diffractive elements, prism arrays, air prisms, v-grooves, diffuse elements, as well as multi-directional waveguide arrays. Prism arrays show an overall 5% increase in the total solar energy conversion. Active coatings that convert infrared light into visible light have shown a 30% increase.|$|E

Unlike other types of spectrometer, this sensitive instrument can take both spectral and spatial readings. It is particularly adept at determining the composition of gases. Spatial observations take a wide-by-narrow view, only one pixel tall and 64 pixels across. The spectral dimension is 1,024 pixels per spatial pixel. Also, it can take many images that create movies {{of the ways in which}} this material is moved around by other forces.|$|E

These introductions {{have the potential to}} significantly alter the <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> <b>composition</b> of savannas worldwide, and have already done so in many areas through a number of processes including altering the fire regime, increasing grazing pressure, competing with native vegetation and occupying previously vacant ecological niches.|$|E

40|$|Continuing {{trends in}} device {{fabrication}} towards smaller feature sizes, lower thermal budgets <b>and</b> advanced device <b>structures</b> put {{greater emphasis on}} controlling the surface <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> reactivity during processing. Since {{the evolution of the}} semiconductor surface during processing is determined by the interaction of multiple surface processes, understanding how to control and modify these processes on the atomic level would enable us to exert greater control over the resulting morphology <b>and</b> <b>composition.</b> Low energy ions represent one method for bringing controlled amounts of energy to the surface to modify surface <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> kinetics. The kinetic energy deposited by the ions can break bonds and displace atoms, creating defect populations significantly in excess of the equilibrium concentration. Consequences of these non-equilibrium conditions include the enhancement of surface kinetic processes, increased surface reactivity and formation of metastable <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> <b>compositions.</b> These effects can be beneficial (ion enhanced mass transport can lead to surface smoothing) or they can be detrimental (residual defects can degrade electrical properties or lead to amorphization). The net results depend on a complex balance that depends on many parameters including ion mass, energy, flux and temperature. In the following section, we review progress both in our fundamental understanding of the production of low-energy ion-induced defects and in the use of low energy ions to enhance surface morphology, stimulate low temperature growth <b>and</b> obtain non-equilibrium <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> <b>compositions...</b>|$|R

500|$|A {{social network}} {{is a social}} {{structure}} composed of individuals (or organizations) called [...] "nodes", which are tied (connected) {{by one or more}} specific types of interdependency, such as friendship, kinship, financial exchange, dislike, sexual relationships, or relationships of beliefs, knowledge or prestige. Social networks operate on many levels, from families up to the level of nations, and {{play a critical role in}} determining the way problems are solved, organizations are run, and the degree to which individuals succeed in achieving their goals. An underlying theoretical assumption of social network analysis is that groups are not necessarily the building blocks of society: the approach is open to studying less-bounded social systems, from non-local communities to networks of exchange. Drawing theoretically from relational sociology, social network analysis avoids treating individuals (persons, organizations, states) as discrete units of analysis, it focuses instead on how the structure of ties affects and constitutes individuals and their relationships. In contrast to analyses that assume that socialization into norms determines behaviour, network analysis looks to see the extent to which the <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> <b>composition</b> of ties affect norms. On the other hand, recent research by Omar Lizardo also demonstrates that network ties are shaped and created by previously existing cultural tastes. Social network theory is usually defined in formal mathematics and may include integration of geographical data into Sociomapping.|$|E
