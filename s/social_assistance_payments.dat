We show that in the 1980 s, tax and transfer programs became more redistributive, offsetting substantial increases in market income inequality. In the 1990 s, the tax and transfer system stopped undoing the increases in market income inequality, leading after-tax income inequality to rise.

40|$|The {{quantitative}} {{significance of}} <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> has grown clearly above all {{since the beginning}} of the 1980 s. This has caused various political players to make very different therapy proposals. Employers and the former Federal Government are pursuing (or pursued) labour market policy objectives with their concept of a wages top-up, as are those who advocate a negative income tax; they want (or wanted) to increase the attractiveness of employment by reducing the amount of net earned income that would be deducted from the <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>payment.</b> The SPD (<b>Social</b> Democratic Party of Germany) intends to create a special benefit system for certain groups of people in order not to refer them to <b>social</b> <b>assistance.</b> The ideas of the red-green Federal Government and the trade unions point in the same direction. The Greens, PDS (Party of Democratic Socialism) and the Joint Charitable Association (Paritätische Wohlfahrtsverband) intend to raise the benefits in order to improve the material position of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> recipients. In this paper the author's own model SimTrans for the microsimulation of the German tax transfer system is used to forecast the effects of various reform concepts on the treasury and labour supply with microeconometric methods on the basis of the socio-economic panel (SOEP) for western and eastern Germany for 1986 to 1996. The simulation model SimTrans permits among other things the calculation of the net income of any German households which are connected with different employment extents of their members before and after a reform of <b>social</b> <b>assistance.</b> For this in addition to social security contributions and direct taxes, the main state social benefits as well as private maintenance payments are taken into account. The labour market policy concepts prove to a large extent to be ineffective or even counterproductive. The other concepts prove to be costly and risky with regard to employment policy. This is particularly true of the PDS proposal, followed by the concepts of the Green Party, the Joint Charitable Association and the SPD.

40|$|Concern over "welfare dependency" has {{featured}} {{prominently in}} the public discoursearound social assistance programmes in numerous countries for many years. The notionthat <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>payments</b> tend to sap the recipient's initiative, independence andpropensity for securing paid employment is widespread and is often assumed to be anobjective fact (rather than a concept) by public officials, social commentators and themedia.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} how data-matching {{could also}} be used to improve the delivery of <b>social</b> security <b>assistance</b> <b>payments</b> rather than simply as a revenue raising exercise. One of the tools used by the government in pursuit of ‘welfare cheats’ is data-matching. The Data-matching Program cross-checks income and personal details held by one agency against similar data held by other agencies, primarily the Australian Taxation Office. The focus of this program is identifying overpayments amongst existing welfare assistance recipients (the difference between overpayment and fraud is not often explained in public reporting of ‘welfare cheating’). However, this focus results in neglect of those people who may be eligible for assistance but are not receiving it. The Australia Institute analysed the Centrelink administered Parenting Payment in order to estimate how many people may be missing out on <b>assistance</b> <b>payments.</b> It was found that in 2008 - 09 an estimated 113, 176 Australian families missed out on assistance for which they appeared to qualify for. The mean value of the estimated payment being missed was $ 206. 63 a week, which potentially adds up to $ 46. 8 million in fortnightly payments, or $ 1, 216 million per annum being missed, should these families have been eligible for the payment for the whole year. This estimate means that for every four recipients of the Parenting Payment one family appears to have been missing out. In 2009 - 10 data-matching by Centrelink found that in nine per cent of the cases reviewed there was some level of overpayment. In contrast, convictions for fraud represent less than 0. 1 per cent of all cases reviewed by Centrelink. This small number demonstrates just how populist rhetoric about ‘welfare cheats’ actually is. Interestingly, this paper finds that the number of people estimated to be missing out on <b>assistance</b> <b>payments</b> is greater than the number of people committing welfare fraud and is closer to the number receiving an overpayment. For example it was found that a similar proportion of parents who do not report receiving Parenting Payment appear to be eligible for payment to those identified as receiving an overpayment. Beyond Centrelink’s current focus on fraud and overpayment, the potential exists to use data-matching to find people who may be missing out on assistance. The Australia Institute found overwhelming public support (75 per cent) for the government to do more to find people who are missing out on <b>assistance</b> <b>payments.</b> The government is already helping people find lost or unclaimed superannuation; there is a clear need for a similar service that helps people claim assistance, and data-matching has the potential to make such a service possible...|$|R
40|$|The {{theory of}} fiscal {{federalism}} argues that local governments should only tax mobile tax bases {{for the purpose}} of charging user taxes which correct for congestion effects. Empirically, we observe that local governments do levy taxes on mobile bases. In Germany, this is the local business tax (Gewerbesteuer). Since such taxes are efficient only if they are raised to cover congestion effects, the justification for these taxes usually put forward is that they serve as user taxes. This paper tests empirically whether that justification holds for the case of German local business taxes. Our findings do not support the user tax argument. Instead, our results suggest that local governments use the local business tax as a source of revenue for general public expenditures. Our empirical analysis finds statistically significant positive effects of changes in expenditures for <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> and interest <b>payments</b> on subsequent tax rate changes.

Our administrative data come from the Australian social security system and provide us with detailed social assistance trajectories – across the entire social safety net – for a birth cohort of young people and their families over an 18 -year period.

These young people also receive more intensive support; an additional $ 12, 000 over an 8 -year period. The intergenerational correlation is particularly strong in the case of disability payments, payments for those with caring responsibilities, and parenting payments for single parents. Disadvantage stemming from parents’ poor labor market outcomes seems to be easier for young people to overcome. This suggests that parental disadvantage may be more harmful to children’s later life outcomes if it is more strongly driven by circumstances rather than personal choice...|$|E

Results from estimating probability models indicate that social assistance receipt is strongly linked to joblessness among household members, the household 2 ̆ 019 s expenditure burden, as well as the lack of financial assets.

We find strong evidence that individuals in Germany are negatively influenced by increased SAP payments controlling for income, {{whether or not they}} actually receive such payments (stigma and social jealousy). While there are obvious benefits to making SAP to those needy, there are substantial negative externalities experienced by those who neither receive SAP nor qualify (counterfactual SAP).

We show that the added benefits of increasing SAP are reduced by 50 to 100 % because of social jealousy and stigma costs, whereas child benefits (Kindergeld) are seen to enhance life satisfaction over and above a simple income effect. Further, own-earned income, over and above the SAP subsistence level is valued much higher than transfer payments at the SAP subsistence level, suggesting a policy focus on increasing employment integration efforts for SAP recipients as opposed merely to providing SAP transfers.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{situation}} of individual farms in Georgia using a survey conducted in 2003, in comparison to a similar survey conducted in 1996. The basic issue investigated is the progress of the land individualization process, and the consequences of this process for the development of the agricultural sector, and more generally for the well-being of farm families and rural poverty. We found significant changes in the farm sector. In particular, average landholdings have increased, mainly through leasing of plots. There is more specialization, with some farmers not producing at all and others expanding. Profits and income have deteriorated markedly, and many producers did not even sell their produce on the market. Those producers who leased land were much more likely to sell their produce on the market and they also had higher incomes and relied less on off-farm income and <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>payments.</b> Still, fewer than 15 % of the farmers lease land. While the average age of the population has increased, the level of schooling declined. This indicates a possible “brain drain” process of selective outmigration. Another worrying implication of the income situation is the increase in the incidence of child labor. These findings indicate that the potential of increased land transactions is still there, and a continuing specialization process that will enable successful farmers to acquire more land could improve the economic well-being of farm families even in a period of depressed produce prices. ...|$|E

Research that addresses financial aspects of retail interventions, particularly using outcome measures such as store sales that are central to retail decision making, is limited. This study explored store sales over time and across product categories during a healthy corner store intervention in a lowincome neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario. Methods: Sales data (from August 2014 to April 2015) were aggregated by product category and by day. We used Microsoft Excel pivot tables to summarize and visually present sales data. We conducted t-tests to examine differences in product category sales by "peak" versus "nonpeak" sales days. Results: Overall store sales peaked on the days {{at the end of each}} month, aligned with the issuing of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>payments.</b> Revenue spikes on peak sales days were driven predominantly by transit pass sales. On peak sales days, mean sales of nonnutritious snacks and cigarettes were marginally higher than on other days of the month. Finally, creative strategies to increase sales of fresh vegetables and fruits seemed to substantially increase revenue from these product categories. Conclusion: Store sales data is an important store-level metric of food environment intervention success. Furthermore, data-driven decision making by retailers can be important for tailoring interventions.

40|$|There is {{considerable}} concern about long-term recipiency of social assistance in many western countries today. Social assistance {{is intended to}} be a temporary solution for unforeseen individual problems, but there are worries that long-term recipiency of social assistance may lead to dependency. In this article, the duration of social assistance periods are investigated using Norwegian administrative data covering the years 1992 – 2002. Two types of analysis were performed. First, discrete time–event history analysis was used to investigate the duration of social assistance and the likelihood of re-entries among those who succeed in exiting social assistance. Second, panel data methods were used to study {{the amount of money that}} individuals receive in social assistance. The results show that most periods of social assistance are relatively short. However, there is variation, including some long-term periods, and a large proportion of those who exit social assistance later re-enter. Immigrants, especially those from African, Asian and Eastern European countries are found to receive more <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>payments,</b> and for longer periods, than people born in Norway. There is no difference between immigrants and people born in Norway with regard to the likelihood of re-entering. The study also shows that there are many who receive universal benefits in addition to social assistance. Based on such findings, we question the common understanding of the social assistance system as a secondary system and safety net for those who fall outside the traditional universal benefit system, and argue that more attention should be paid to the importance of institutional factors than to discourse on dependency...|$|E
40|$|The Norwegian {{public sector}} appears both {{centralized}} and decentralized. On the one hand, municipalities {{are responsible for}} {{a large share of}} public sector spending, producing a wide range of important welfare services. On the other hand, municipal prioritization is to a large degree controlled by central government. Municipalities are mainly financed by transfers from central government, and the scope for variation in local taxes is limited. Although transfers mainly come as general grants, which in principle allows local prioritization, local service production is regulated by a large set of national legal regulations. The decentralized service production and the use of general grants are clearly inspired by fiscal federalism theory. However, the Norwegian system goes against central theoretical principles. This provides a basis for hypotheses for municipal and individual adaptions. This dissertation consists of four articles where such hypotheses are tested against the empirical reality of Norwegian public sector. Two of the articles concern child care and two concern social assistance. Chapter 2 analyzes the effect of an experiment where 20 Norwegian municipalities had their earmarked grants turned into general grants. Focus is on the child care sector, which at that time had the largest earmarked grant. The empirical analysis shows a small, yet statistically significant, reduction in child care supply among participating municipalities. Chapter 3 concerns the Norwegian child care reform. In 2004, municipalities became responsible for financing private child care institutions at levels corresponding to spending in the municipalities’ own child care. The analysis confirms that municipalities with a higher share of private child care reduced their spending in municipal child care compared to other municipalities. In chapter 4, I analyze the effect of national benefit norms for social assistance. A large number of municipalities adopted the national norms. There is, however, no sign of effect for actual <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>payments.</b> In chapter 5, I analyze the welfare migration hypothesis and find that social assistance clients migrate to municipalities with higher benefits. As in chapter 4, municipal social assistance generosity is measured by actual payments as opposed to local benefit norms...|$|E
