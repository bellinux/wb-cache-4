The Mughals expanded cultivated land in the Bengal delta under the leadership of Sufis, which consolidated the foundation of Bengali Muslim society.|$|R
50|$|The {{first of}} Wang Mang's {{failures}} was to seize all private land under the wangtian system and prohibiting land transactions. If a person's land exceeded 0.6 square kilometers, then he must distribute them to neighbors or relatives. Those {{who dared to}} oppose it were exiled to the wild borderland. He also prohibited people from saving and using the Han coins that the people considered reliable, and he also exiled those who violated this policy. Therefore, farmers and tradesmen lost their livelihood. Further, those who were severely punished for trading land or trading Han coins were innumerable. He then created the six monopolies, ordering local governments to monopolize <b>liquor,</b> <b>salt,</b> and iron, and he created taxes on the goods coming out of mountains, forests, and lakes. These are all policies that angered the Chinese.|$|R

Although the central government's monopolies on <b>salt,</b> iron, and <b>liquor</b> eventually failed and were relinquished back to private production, the government successfully nationalized the issuing of coin currency through its imperial mint, which lasted from 113 BC {{until the end of the}} dynasty. The conscription system for commoners as non-professional soldiers was reduced in size in favor of a volunteer army and a substitution tax by Eastern Han. A small professional standing army existed throughout Western and Eastern Han.

In 1838, under Muhsin bin Fadl, Lahej ceded 194 km2 including Aden to the British. On 19 January 1839, the British East India Company landed Royal Marines at Aden to secure the territory and stop attacks by pirates against British shipping to India. In 1850 it was declared a free trade port with the <b>liquor,</b> <b>salt,</b> arms, and opium trades developing duties as it won all the coffee trade from Mokha. The port lies about equidistant from the Suez Canal, Mumbai, and Zanzibar, which were all important British possessions. Aden had been an entrepôt and a way-station for seamen in the ancient world. There, supplies, particularly water, were replenished, so, in the mid-19th century, it became necessary to replenish coal and boiler water. Thus Aden acquired a coaling station at Steamer Point and Aden was to remain under British control until 1967.|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{experimental results}} for the selective removal of strontium and cesium from simulated waste solutions using monosodium titanate (MST) and crystalline silicotitanate (CST) -laden filter cartridges. Four types of ion exchange cartridge media (CST and MST designed by both 3 M and POROX{reg_sign}) were evaluated. In these proof-of-principle tests effective uptake of both Sr- 85 and Cs- 137 was observed. However, the experiments were not performed long enough to determine the saturation levels or breakthrough curve for each filter cartridge. POREX{reg_sign} MST cartridges, which by design were based on co-sintering of the active titanates with polyethylene particles, seem to perform {{as well as the}} 3 M-designed MST cartridges (impregnated filter membrane design) in the uptake of strontium. At low salt simulant conditions (0. 29 M Na{sup +}), the instantaneous decontamination factor (D{sub F}) for Sr- 85 with the 3 M-design MST cartridge measured 26, representing the removal of 96 % of the Sr- 85. On the other hand, the Sr- 85 instantaneous D{sub F} with the POREX{reg_sign} design MST cartridge measured 40 or 98 % removal of the Sr- 85. Strontium removal with the 3 M-design MST and CST cartridges placed in series filter arrangement produced an instantaneous decontamination factor of 41 or 97. 6 % removal compared to an instantaneous decontamination factor of 368 or 99. 7 % removal of the strontium with the POREX{reg_sign} MST and CST cartridge design placed in series. At high salt simulant conditions (5. 6 M Na{sup +}), strontium removal with 3 M-designed MST cartridge only and with 3 M-designed MST and CST cartridges operated in a series configuration were identical. The instantaneous decontamination factor and the strontium removal efficiency, under the above configuration, averaged 8. 6 and 88 %, respectively. There were no POREX{reg_sign} cartridge experiments using the higher ionic strength simulant solution. At low salt simulant conditions, the uptake of Cs- 137 with POREX{reg_sign} CST cartridge out performed the 3 M-designed CST cartridges. The POREX{reg_sign} CST cartridge, with a Cs- 137 instantaneous decontamination factor of 55 and a Cs- 137 removal efficiency of 98 % does meet the Cs- 137 decontamination goals in the low <b>salt</b> simulant <b>liquor.</b> The Cs- 137 removal with 3 M-designed CST cartridge produced a decontamination factor of 2 or 49 % removal efficiency. The Cs- 137 performance graph for the 3 M-designed CST cartridge showed an early cessation in the uptake of cesium- 137. This behavior was not observed with the POREX{reg_sign} CST cartridges. No Cs- 137 uptake tests were performed with the POREX{reg_sign} CST cartridges at high salt simulant conditions. The 3 M-designed CST cartridges, with an instantaneous Cs- 137 decontamination factor of less than 3 and a Cs- 137 removal efficiency of less than 50 % failed to meet the Cs- 137 decontamination goals in both the low and high <b>salt</b> simulant <b>liquors.</b> This poor performance in the uptake of Cs- 137 by the 3 M CST cartridges may be attributed to fabrication flaws for the 3 M-designed CST cartridges. The reduced number of CST membrane wraps per cartridge during the cartridge design phase, from 3 -whole wraps to about 1. 5, may have contributed to Cs- 137 laden simulant channeling/by-pass which led to the poor performance in terms of Cs- 137 sorption characteristics for the 3 M designed CST cartridges. The grinding of CST ion exchange materials, to reduce the particle size distribution and thus enhance their easy incorporation into the filter membranes and the co-sintering of MST with polyethylene particles, did not adversely affect the sorption kinetics of both CST and MST in the uptake of Cs- 137 and Sr- 85, respectively. In general, the POREX{reg_sign} based cartridges showed more resistance to simulant flow through the filter cartridges as evidenced by higher pressure differences across the cartridges. Based on these findings they conclude that incorporating MST and CST sorbents into filter membranes represent a promising method for the semi-continuous removal of radioisotopes of strontium and cesium from waste solutions...|$|R

Its charter was granted by King Kazimierz Wielki; the name of the town comes from bishop of Kraków, Jan Bodzanta. Bodzentyn was the center of land properties (see herrschaft) of the bishops of Kraków. In 1365 bishop Florian from Mokrsko built here a castle, and surrounded the town with defensive walls. In 1380 bishop Jan Radlica founded Holy Cross church, and in the late Middle Ages, Bodzentyn was one of the most important urban centers of northern Lesser Poland. In 1410 King Władysław Jagiełło spent a few days here, on his way to the Battle of Grunwald. Soon afterwards, the town burned in a fire, so bishop Wojciech Jastrzębiec managed to convince the king to grant new privileges to Bodzentyn. Another bishop who contributed to the development of the town was Piotr Wysz Radoliński. He granted Bodzentyn’s residents the rights to cut down forests, graze cattle, sell <b>salt,</b> meats and <b>liquors.</b> Furthermore, a marketplace was established. In 1450, Cardinal Zbigniew Oleśnicki founded here a Gothic collegiate church.|$|R
40|$|In {{vacuum salt}} {{production}} sulfate {{is an important}} impurity, {{but it is also}} used to remove other cationic impurities from the raw brine. Removal of excess sulfate is currently done by purging <b>salt</b> crystallizer mother <b>liquor</b> from the brine plant, or crystallizing sodium sulfate through evaporative or cooling crystallization. The use of nanofiltration for the production of brines supersaturated in sodium sulfate is a technically feasible and attractive alternative. Crystallization of sodium sulfate in the membrane modules can be avoided by the presence of a primary nucleation inhibitor in the feed to the nanofiltration unit. Sodium sulfate crystallization can be induced in a separate crystallizer outside of the membrane unit by addition of crystal seeds. NF 270 is a suitable membrane for this application and is preferred over Desal DK, Desal DL, TS- 80 and MPF- 34. Chloride and bromide retentions are negative and they are a function of the difference in sulfate concentration between concentrate and permeate. Carbonate retentions are linearly dependent on sulfate retentions. Calcium retention for NF 270 is in excess of 95 % and proven to be stable during 1200 h of continuous on-site pilot plant operation.

40|$|Precipitation {{of sodium}} <b>salts</b> in black <b>liquor</b> {{evaporators}} causes problems by forming scales on the evaporator surface, reducing heat transfer and cleaning intervals. Most problems are {{connected with the}} crystallization of sodium carbonate and sodium sulfate. As the solubility of these salts is exceeded, a crystal mass must form somewhere. Crystallization can occur either in the bulk solution, on the heat transfer surface, or on other surfaces. It is always desirable to create bulk crystals. If crystals form and remain on the surfaces, a layer of scales will build up with time. A method for estimating the distribution of crystal masses between the bulk and on surfaces has been developed in this work. The method is primarily based on inline density measurements combined with inline measurements of the system's water mass. It {{has been applied to}} aqueous solution of sodium carbonate and sodium sulfate in a research black liquor falling film evaporator. Experiments have proven that the method gives valuable information on the crystallization process. It shows where crystals are formed during primary nucleation, as well as during the subsequent continuous crystallization. In an industrial black liquor evaporator, the metastable limit can be passed if it is operated under non-steady-state conditions.

The process exploits the density differences of the three phases (ice, <b>salt</b> and mother <b>liquor)</b> present at the eutectic point and thus separation and recovery of the crystals is achieved. In this contribution, the effect of aggregation of ice was investigated, specifically the encapsulation of the salt crystals in the interstitial spaces of the aggregates. This not only lowers the yield of salt, but subsequently decreases {{the purity of the}} ice crystals themselves. Furthermore, key parameters such as settling/flotation time, agitation rate in the separation vessel as well as increasing the number of washing stages, is investigated to determine if the parameters reduce the effects of aggregation.

Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of polysaccharides such as starch and cellulose can also be combined with ethanol separation in the Continuous Stirred Reactor Separator (CSRS). Application of the bio-reactor to various substrates was investigated on a lab scale with fermentation of raw starch, cane molasses, xylose, whey permeate and permeate mother liquor. Flocculating yeast strains for high density sucrose/glucose fermentation were selected and adapted to form fast settling pellets. A strain of K marxianus capable of fermenting high <b>salt</b> permeate mother <b>liquor</b> was also selected and adapted. A low energy solvent ethanol recovery system was developed for ethanol recovery from the vapors leaving the reactor/separator. This Solvent Absorption/Extractive Distillation (SAED) process gives a low energy method for purifying the ethanol to an anhydrous product. The amount of energy needed to recover an anhydrous ethanol product from a CSRS stage running at 8 % ethanol was calculated to be under 8, 000 BTU/gallon.
