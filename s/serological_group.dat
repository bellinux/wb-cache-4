Forty-four per cent of all strains were typable in the first eight of the <b>serological</b> <b>groups</b> used. Of the primary isolates from symptomatic infections, 65 X 7 % were typable; 48 - 6 % of all strains of the <b>serological</b> <b>groups</b> 01, 02, 04, and 06 occurred in these primary symptomatic isolates. There was a good correlation in the serological typing of five colonies isolated from the initial isolation plates. There was complete agreement in all the typable strains, 325 of the 350 colonies. Twenty-five strains were not typable due to roughness. It is considered that this reproducibility confirms the validity of using one colony for serotyping of urinary isolates. Statistically {{there was no significant}} difference in the number of typable strains from specimens with high bacterial counts and specimens with low bacterial counts.

G, H, K, M, N, O and Q; and 164 strains of <b>serological</b> <b>Group</b> B from bovine and human sources) were tested for 103 characters based on their morphology, physiology and biochemistry. Computer analysis of {{the results indicated that}} the majority of strains received as <b>serological</b> <b>Group</b> B grouped into eight clusters distinct from streptococci of other serological Groups. Serological grouping and typing, phage typing, plasmid studies, moles % G+C and DNA-DNA hybridization, and chemical analysis of the polar lipids were performed on representative strains from each of the eight numerical taxonomic clusters. The results indicate that while there are differences between strains of streptococci of <b>serological</b> <b>Group</b> B (Streptococcus agalactiae) on the basis of biochemical tests, serotyping and phage typing, there is no correlation between any of these differences and source of isolation. The differences between the strains, whether they be isolated from human or bovine sources, are no greater than might be expected due to variation within one bacterial species. This conclusion is supported by the results of the polar lipid and DNA studies. Indeed, all the evidence presented here strongly suggests that streptococci of <b>serological</b> <b>Group</b> B which cause human and bovine diseases are in fact all members of one species, Streptococcus agalactiae. Of interest is the isolation of plasmids from, one strain of bovine origin but none from the human strains examined.
