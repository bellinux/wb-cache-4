40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} way in which Shell {{positioned}} itself in relation to the debate over climate change that developed from the late 1980 s to the end of the 1990 s. A key event in this process was the negotiation of the Kyoto protocol. The research considers the contribution of factors such as the culture and structure of the organisation and events in Shell's recent and more distant past that may have influenced organisational decision making processes. The thesis discusses how responses to a combination of key events at a particular time led to a particular outcome through a process of path dependency. The research takes the form of a single case study. The source of primary data was semi structured interviews with key individuals linked to Shell. Secondary data came from speeches by senior Shell managers, other <b>Shell</b> <b>documents</b> and media reports. The findings are written in the form of a historical narrative.

The convergence of the method is established and it is supported by numerous examples of different loading and support conditions.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} some large-scale {{patterns of}} behavioural change {{that are often}} viewed as indicators for the advent of cultural modernity and developed symbolic communication. Using examples from Africa and Eurasia, the paper reviews patterns of lithic and organic technology, subsistence and settlement as potential indicators of modern behaviour. These areas of research produce a mosaic picture of advanced technology and behavioural patterns that come and go during the late Middle and Late Pleistocene. Based on these data the emergence of modern behaviour, {{as seen in the}} archaeologically visible material record, appears to be gradual and heterogeneous in space and time. The evidence for the use of pigments is consistent with these data. During {{the early part of the}} Late Pleistocene personal ornaments in the form of sea <b>shells</b> are <b>documented</b> in south-western Asia and southern Africa. By about 40 thousand years ago (Kya) a diverse array of personal ornaments is documented across the Old World in association with Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans in Europe.

The timing and distribution of the appearance of figurative art and other classes of artefacts including musical instruments point to a more punctuated development of fully modern behaviour during the middle of the Late Pleistocene at approximately 40 Kya.

These mirrors at an earlier stage of development were reported in Nanolaminate Mirrors With Integral Figure-Control Actuators (NPO- 30221), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 26, No. 5 (May 2002), page 80. To recapitulate: These mirrors comprise metallic film reflectors on nanolaminate substrates that contain "in-plane" actuators for controlling surface figures with micron-level precision. The actuators are integral parts of the mirror structures, typically fabricated as patches that are bonded onto the rear (nonreflective) surfaces of the mirror <b>shells.</b> The current <b>documents</b> discuss mathematical modeling of mirror deflections caused by actuators arranged in unit cells distributed across the rear mirror surfaces. One of the documents emphasizes an actuator configuration in which a mirror surface is divided into hexagonal unit cells. Each unit cell contains four rectangular actuator patches in an off-axis cruciform pattern to induce a combination of bending and twisting. For deflections to reduce certain optical aberrations, it is found that, relative to other configurations, this configuration involves a smaller areal density of actuators...|$|R
40|$|The eastern Mediterranean and the Aegean Sea in particular, are {{the most}} active seismic regions in Europe. Historically, {{numerous}} earthquakes have occurred {{in this part of}} the world and comprehensive tsunami recordings exist. Nevertheless, field evidence of tsunamis is rare, although many neotectonic movements certainly must have triggered very strong tsunami waves. Along the coastlines of western Crete, we found evidence for tsunami impacts, such as 1) bimodal deposits (large clasts floating in sands comprised of shell fragments); 2) dislocation of large boulders with tilting of biogenous notches; and 3) boulders (with Lithophaga or Cliona borings) weighing up to 75 tons thrown onshore and imbedded in strata of marine <b>shells.</b> This paper <b>documents</b> these deposits and discusses whether they originated from the sudden uplift that occurred in 365 AD.

40|$|Stress {{analysis}} of the coil winding packs of the production solenoid indicates acceptable conductor stresses for a structural concept which employs external shells {{to contribute to the}} support of the coil hoop stresses. The recommendation of external shells/mandrels as a support scheme results from the advantage in conductor stress, from the need to bridge axial loads around the thin coil sections, and the need to have a reliable attachment point for the cold mass support. The external shell/mandrel allows freedom in selecting higher conductor current density, while controlling the conductor hoop stress with a thicker shell. Additional nuclear heat in the thicker external shells may be removed separately from the winding pack. Conductor and coil analyses are preliminary, subject to final conductor and current selection. A cold mass support scheme employing flexures to support the axial attractive force between the production and transport solenoids is explored. It's use to support the deadweight of the coil would require wide flexures, more like a skirt, and it is likely that vertical support rods will be required, at least at the high field end of the production solenoid, if not at both ends. The cryostat inner shell was modeled as 2 cm thick and is capable of supporting the nuclear shield (up to 70 tons) - but the analysis has only considered the shield in it's assembled location in which the end caps of the cryostat stabilize the <b>shell.</b> This <b>document</b> and all memoranda in this series are internal and are intended as a record of MIT work in progress on the MECO program.

40|$|Predation can {{strongly}} influence community {{structure and}} ecosystem function, so {{the loss of}} key predators can have dramatic ecological consequences, unless other predatory species in the system are capable of playing similar ecological roles. In light of the recent outbreak of sea star wasting disease (SSWD) and subsequent depletion of west coast sea star populations, {{including those of the}} keystone predator Pisaster ochraceus, we examined whether large mobile crabs could play a role as predators on mussels (Mytilus californianus) on a rocky shore in Northern California. Using a combination of sea star removal and predator exclusion cages we found that mussel mortality was 43 - 294 times greater in uncaged treatments versus caged treatments. Mortality on uncaged mussels at low tidal elevations was due to predation by large mobile crabs (Cancer productus and Romaleon antennarium); confirmed by the presence of mussel <b>shell</b> fragments and <b>documented</b> attacks on wax snail replicas. Laboratory feeding assays indicated that crabs, on a per unit biomass basis, can consume almost twenty-five times as many mussels per day than sea stars, which together with the results of our field experiment, suggest that large predatory crabs could {{play an important role in}} maintaining ecosystem function through their predation on mussels on rocky shores where P. ochraceus are rare, absent, or have been depleted by SSWD...|$|R

40|$|Microemulsion (water-in-oil) methods {{enable the}} {{encapsulation}} of individual nanoparticles into SiO 2 spheres. The major drawbacks of this method, when applied for silica encapsulation of anisotropic nanorods (NRs), are a spatially unequal silica growth and long reaction times (24 h at least). In this work, various tetra-alkoxysilanes (tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and tetrapropyl orthosilicate (TPOS)) with different alkyl-chain lengths {{were used as}} the silica precursors in attempt to tune the silanization behavior of CdSe/CdS NRs in a microemulsion system. We find an enhanced spatial homogeneity of the silica growth with decreasing alkyl-chain length of the tetra-alkoxysilanes. In particular, by using TMOS as the precursor, NRs can be fully encapsulated in a continuous thin (< 5 nm) silica shell within only 1 h reaction time. Surprisingly, the thin silica shell showed a superior shielding ability to acidic environment even compared to the 30 nm thick shell prepared by using TEOS. Our investigations suggest that the lower steric hindrance of TMOS compared to TEOS or TPOS strongly promotes the homogeneous growth of the silica shells while its increased hydrolysis rate leads decreases the porosity of these <b>shells.</b> Comment: This <b>document</b> is the unedited author's version of a Submitted Work that was subsequently accepted for publication in Langmuir, copyright o̧p̧y̧ŗi̧ģḩţ American Chemical Society after peer review.

A new Download Manager shell location suggested that Internet Explorer would get a Mozilla-style download manager, though no such functionality was apparent. Significant memory leak problems with Windows Explorer and the Sidebar made this build difficult to use, which resulted in some third-party hacks to mitigate the problem. The back-end database of Outlook Express changed completely, and became dependent on WinFS to store its email. WinFS itself still had significant performance and memory usage issues, and so it became common for testers to disable WinFS entirely, thus rendering Outlook Express inoperative.|$|R
40|$|By {{means of}} {{consecutive}} alkaline and proteolytic treatments {{of the organic}} framework’s interlamellar layers extracted from the nacre of H. rufescens, we have exposed a core of aligned parallel chitin fibers. Our findings both verify basic elements of the interlamellar layer structural model of Levi-Kalisman et al. (2001) and extend the more detailed model of Bezares et al. (2008, 2010). We observe via SEM imaging of square millimeter sized samples, which include numerous interlamellar layers and micron sized, yet nanocrystalline, CaCO 3 tiles whose native orientation within the <b>shell</b> was first <b>documented,</b> that the chitin fibers in all layers are aligned normal to the growth direction of the shell. Similar alignment has been suggested in the literature for two other classes of mollusks, viz. N. rupertus and P. martensii (Weiner and Traub, 1983; Wada, 1958), suggesting {{that this may be}} a more general motif. We find that in order to expose the chitin core it is necessary to first remove protein by an alkaline treatment followed by enzymatic digestion with proteinase-K. We also observe what appear to be the points of traversal of the exposed chitin core by mineral bridges. The implications of these findings touch directly and most specifically upon the expected mechanical properties of organic framework layers such as stiffness and relaxation time constants, viz. they should be planeorthotropic. Single interlamellar layers extracted from nacre should, by implication, also exhibit an orthotropic stiffness. These novel findings provide the structural picture required for a complete anisotropic, time dependent, constitutive description of nacre long thought to be a paradigm of structural optimization. Such a model is briefly described herein and is developed, in full, in Part II of this series...|$|R
