50|$|The {{following}} description {{applies to}} a loam soil and agricultural crops. When a field is flooded, {{it is said}} to be saturated and all available air space is occupied by water. The suction required to draw water into a plant root is zero. As the field drains under the influence of gravity (drained water is called gravitational water or drain-able water), the <b>suction</b> a <b>plant</b> must produce to use such water increases to 1/3 bar. At that point, the soil is said to have reached field capacity, and plants that use the water must produce increasingly higher suction, finally up to 15 bar. At 15 bar suction, the soil water amount is called wilting percent. At that <b>suction</b> the <b>plant</b> cannot sustain its water needs as water is still being lost from the plant by transpiration; the plant's turgidity is lost, and it wilts. The next level, called air-dry, occurs at 1000 bar suction. Finally the oven dry condition is reached at 10,000 bar suction. All water below wilting percentage is called unavailable water.|$|R
40|$|Irrigation on {{small-scale}} farms {{has been noted}} as a key method to help lift subsistence farmers out of poverty. With water scarity growing around the globe and {{lack of access to}} electricity still prevalent in rural areas, the need to develop an energy efficient irrigation system that simultaneous limits wasted water while being low cost is essential. The possibility of using a wicking irrigation system that relies on the <b>suction</b> <b>plants</b> create for water to mitigate the pumping pressure is investigated. A theoretical model for such a system is developed for an acre sized wicking irrigation system, and the power and water efficiency is compared to a standard drip irrigation system. While the wicking irrigation system has a greater distribution of water delivery from the wicks than compared to the dripper system, a wicking system has the potential to operate at much lower power, with the possibility of even being a power source. If a direct coupling could be developed between the plant's roots and wick, eliminating the need for water to travel through the soil, the energy benefit of the wicking system would be even more dramatic. by Lauren B.

The front wings lie flat without flight, with the scleratized pronotum and corium regions, coloured in a dark red pigmentation. The compound eyes are also pigmented red. There is a speckled pigmentation extending from the upper dorsal thorax to the abdominal region. The tarsi are 2-segmented and antennae 5-segmented. As a heteropteran phytophagyte of mainly green leafed trees and red berries, the species feeds through the anterior section of the rostrum, which <b>suctions</b> liquidised <b>plant</b> tissue, semi-digested by the delivery of saliva enzymes from the posterior sector of the rostrum. The rostrum beak acts as a modified proboscis formed by the interlocking of mandibular and maxillary stylet into a double-tubed elongation covered by the labium.

The rostrum pricks into berries to access fruit sugars. As a stress response, an orange secretion is secreted from gland openings in the thorax.|$|R
40|$|A rhombic {{planform}} nonlinear cross-diffusive instability {{analysis is}} applied to a particular inte-raction-diffusion plant-ground water model system in an arid flat environment.

40|$|Subsurface drip {{irrigation}} (SDI) {{is one of}} the most promising irrigation systems. It is based on small and frequent water supplies. Because SDI emitters are buried, their discharges are dependent on the water status at the vicinity of the outlets. This paper was targeted to design the SDI laterals accounting for the soil water-retention characteristics and the roots water extraction. The proposed approach provides systematic triggering and cut-off of irrigation events based on fixed water suctions in the vadose zone. In doing so, the soil water content is maintained at an optimal threshold ascertaining the best plant growth. Knowing the soil water-retention curve, the appropriate water <b>suction</b> for the <b>plant</b> growth, and the emitter discharge-pressure head relationship, the developed method allows the computation of the required hydraulics of the lateral (e. g., inlet pressure head, inside diameter, etc.).

40|$|International audienceCarnivorous aquatic Utricularia species catch small prey {{animals with}} millimeter-sized {{underwater}} suction traps, which have fascinated scientists since Darwin's early work on carnivorous <b>plants.</b> <b>Suction</b> takes place after mechanical triggering and {{is due to}} a release of stored elastic energy in the trap body, accompanied with a very fast opening and closure of a trapdoor which otherwise closes the trap entrance watertight. The exceptional trapping speed far above human visual perception impeded profound investigations up to now. Using highspeed video imaging and special microscopy techniques, we obtained fully time-resolved recordings of the door movement. We found that this unique trapping mechanism conducts suction in less than a millisecond and therefore ranks among the fastest plant movements known. Fluid acceleration reaches very high values, leaving little chances for prey animals to escape. We discovered that the door deformation is morphologically predetermined, and actually performs a buckling/un-buckling process including a complete trapdoor curvature inversion. This process, that we predict using dynamical simulations and simple theoretical models, is highly reproducible: the traps are autonomously repetitive as they fire spontaneously after 5 - 20 hours and reset actively to their ready-to-catch condition...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{seasonal}} hydrogeological {{responses of}} vegetated soil slopes {{is vital to}} slope stability because pore-water pressure (PWP) varies from positive values upon rainfall in wet seasons to negative values upon plant evapotranspiration (ET) in dry seasons. There are, however, few case histories that report seasonal performance of vegetated soil slopes. In this study, a vegetated slope situated in Hong Kong was instrumented to analyse (i) groundwater flow during rainfall in the wet season and (ii) effects of plant ET on PWP in the dry season. Two-and three-dimensional anisotropic transient seepage analyses are conducted to identify groundwater flow mechanism(s) during a heavy rainstorm. Through water and energy balance calculations, measured plant-induced suction is interpreted with plant characteristic and climatic data. During the rainstorm, substantial recharge of the groundwater table was recorded, likely due to preferential water flow along relict joints and three-dimensional cross-slope groundwater flow. During the dry season, the peak <b>suction</b> induced by <b>plant</b> ET is up to 200 kPa {{and the depth of}} influence is shallower than 200 % of the root depth.

Reducing {{the concentration of}} total dissolved solids (TDS) may be achieved via desalination; however, conventional desalination processes are not feasible for crop irrigation given their high cost and complexity. In this study a subsurface irrigation system fashioned from semi-permeable membranes that respond {{to changes in the}} soil matric <b>suction</b> potential and <b>plant</b> demand was used to supply water to germinate bean seeds (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in a silty clay loam soil on saline solutions of 0. 21, 1. 4 and 3. 1 dS/m. Mean germination time, coefficient of uniformity of germination, root to shoot ratio, fresh and dry weight for root, stem and leaves were measured on three commercially available membranes: reverse osmosis (RO), forward osmosis (FO) and ultrafiltration (control for soil water absorption). Electrical conductivity of soil was used as a parameter to indicate the effects of irrigation with {{brackish water}} through membranes on soil quality during germination and seedling establishment, though long term effects need to be studied.

40|$|Hilly {{topography}} {{and frequent}} rainstorms result in many slope failures in Hong Kong {{which is a}} major hazard receiving much public attention. Various mitigation schemes have been implemented {{over the last few}} decades to increase the safety margins of urban cut and fill slopes. The urge to build a sustainable green society has made the conventional solution of using hard sprayed concrete cover inadequate. Greening of urban slopes using live self-generated vegetation with minimal maintenance cost thus became a favorable option and is worth to further explore in a more systematic manner. It is believed that live vegetation can upgrade a slope through hydrological and mechanical contributions. Both field and laboratory studies were undertaken in this study which covered the mechanical and hydrological aspects of vegetation. Four native species, including shrubs, Rhodomyrtus tomentosa and Melastoma sanguineum, and small trees, Schefflera heptaphylla and Reevesia thyrsoidea, were studied. About 1, 000 seedlings were planted and monitored for three years. Natural individuals of the selected native species and an exotic tree, Leucaena leucocephala, were sampled randomly for comparison. Their growth performance, root distribution and mechanical functions were compared between establishment time and types, species, plant forms and tree origins, by laboratory (tensile and direct shear tests) and field (uprooting and direct shear tests) tests. Finally, slope stability analysis was conducted on bare slopes and slopes vegetated using the selected native species. After a three-year establishment period, the growth rate of the studied species has not yet leveled off. The average maximum rooting depth (RD) of the three-year old trees exceeded 1 m. The planted samples had larger root systems than the natural ones in terms of most root attributes. The growth potential of these four species on typical man-made slopes in Hong Kong was highlighted. The anchorage ability of the plants was investigated by uprooting test. Correlation between the peak pull-out resistance (Pmax) and plant parameters gives a first-hand estimation of Pmax. Above-ground dry weight was the key indicator of Pmax for both plant forms of the native species while trees could also be well predicted by basal diameter. However, root shapes had no significant impact on Pmax. In laboratory direct shear test, reinforced samples had higher peak shear strength (Δs) at longer displacement. Root directions and root area ratio (RAR) had significant influence on Δs. Significant power relationship was found between root diameter and Δs. From field tests, no significant Δs was found between plant forms and establishment types, which indicates similar magnitude of reinforcement by the planted shrubs and naturally grown trees. Using the Wu Model, the maximum root cohesion (cr) of the studied species was found within the top 0. 4 m soil depth. The increase in the factor of safety (FOS) is remarkable in shallow soil depth determined by RD. In sunny days, the effect of <b>suction</b> induced by <b>plants</b> is reduced. With the typical approach of slope stability analysis, an unsafe slope can be turned to marginally safe by mature trees with similar reinforcement effects as shrubs in the same height class. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|Chapters 1 and 2 {{identify}} the aims {{and objectives of}} the study, as well as the hypotheses and assumptions required. The relevant literature on soil water availability and plant response to water stress is explored. In particular these two chapters explain that plants extract water from soils by regulating a host of physiological mechanisms at their disposal – some plants are more efficient than others at doing this. As soil dries out, plants must ‘sense’ and gradually integrate the net effect of many soil conditions including: increasing soil aeration, as well as matric and osmotic suctions and soil strength, but also diminishing soil hydraulic conductivity. Plants, therefore, gradually take up water more slowly as the soil dries, depending on environmental conditions and other factors, all of which vary enormously on an hourly basis and which are difficult to predict let alone measure. Groenevelt et al. (2001; 2004) proposed a model, the Integral Water Capacity (IWC) to predict the effects of soil physical and chemical restrictions on water availability, but this model has not yet been tested against the performance of realplants. Evaluation of this model forms the primary focus of this study. The IWC uses the soil water retention curve, θ(h), to produce a differential water capacity, C(h) = dθ/dh, which is then reduced using various weighting functions, ω(h),to account for the above limiting physical and chemical properties, then integrated to produce a total amount of water that can be extracted from the soil by plants. The key, of course, is to identify robust weighting functions for each of the limiting soilconditions, yet this is no easy task because the limiting soil conditions often interact. For example, as the soil dries out, the hydraulic conductivity drops while aeration,strength and salinity all increase to varying extents – this makes it difficult to quantify the effect of any one limitation. In the present study it was therefore decided to focus solely on the unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity as the major limiting soil condition. A significant drop in the soil hydraulic conductivity during a dry period after rainfall or irrigation can make the difference between crop success and failure, particularly in Mediterranean and arid environments. The aims of the study were to: 1) Evaluate the effect of declining soil hydraulic conductivity on soil water availability in the absence of all other known soil physical limitations. 2) Evaluate the link between real plant response to water stress and that predicted using the IWC model of Groenevelt et al. (2001) for a range of different plant species, planting densities, soil types and environmental conditions. 3) Evaluate the utility of the hydraulic conductivity function of Grant et al. (2010) in weighting the water capacity. Chapter 3 identifies the main methods used in the study. It explains that two different, light-textured soils were selected (Very fine sand and Loamy sand), for some pot experiments designed to compare the predicted and measured amounts of water that two contrasting plants (maize v. sorghum) could extract from the soil under different environmental conditions (low and high evaporative demand). In the first instance, the water retention curves were measured on soil samples packed to the same bulk densities used in the plant experiments. The water retention curves were then modelled to produce the differential water capacities and the relative hydraulic conductivities for the two soils. The IWC was then calculated based upon experimental data describing plant responses to environmental conditions (see below). A large number of pots holding 5 kg soil and different numbers of maize or sorghum seeds were well watered until plants reached a critical stage, after which half the pots were no longer supplied with water while the other half were maintained at ideal water contents. An identical set of control pots containing no plants was monitored to separate evaporation from plant transpiration, and to thus determine the soil matric suction at which the rate of water loss from the planted pots declined to the rate of natural evaporation – indicating the point at which transpiration effectively stopped. Stomatal conductance, g (mmol m⁻² s⁻¹), and soil water content, θ (m³ /m³) were measured first thing each morning every day until this was no longer possible. When stomatal conductance on the stressed plants could no longer be measured (ranging between 5 and 21 days depending on conditions) the experiments were terminated and the fresh weights of roots and shoots measured. Chapter 4 describes how the stomatal conductance of the stressed plants, g, was expressed as a fraction of that for the well-watered control plants, g[subscript]c, and plotted as afunction of the soil water suction, h (cm). At a certain stage the decline in relative stomatal conductance, g/g[subscript]c, changed from a curved to a linear form and continued in thisway until it was no longer possible to take measurements, at which point g/g[subscript]c wasjudged to be zero. The transition between the curved and linear decline in g/g[subscript]c was considered to mark the soil matric suction, h[subscript]t, at which plants began to experienceterminal water stress. When plants finally stopped transpiring, the soil matric suction, hw, was noted as the end point of the experiments. The stressed plants stopped transpiring across a large range of soil matric suctions, demonstrating that plant-response is strongly influenced by soil texture, plant species, root-length density, and environmental conditions. By far the most important factor, however, was soil texture; plants grown in the Very fine sand (coarser-textured) perished at suctions much smaller than the classical wilting point of 15, 000 cm, while plants grown in the finer Loamy sand persisted to matric suctions of nearly 27, 000 cm in some cases. The other variables appeared to be less important and somewhat complicated by interactions. For example, when averaged across soil texture (and in most cases, regardless), sorghum extracted water to greater matric <b>suctions</b> at all <b>planting</b> densities than did maize; however at higher planting densities and under higher evaporative demand, maize extracted water to greater matric suctions than sorghum. The large difference in behaviour of plants between the two soils demonstrated that a primary cause of water stress was a limitation in the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. This highlighted the importance of hydrodynamics in controlling water-availability to plants and indicated the potential usefulness of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function in weighting the differential water capacity. Chapter 5 explores the extent to which dynamic plant responses to water stress can be used to calculate the IWC. The best function for weighting the soil water capacity was found to be a modified quadratic relation that incorporated the critical soil matric suctions at the onset and end of hydraulic stress, as well as the root-length density. The onset of hydraulic stress shifted toward lower matric suctions as temperature and evaporative demand increased, and transpiration stopped at lower matric suctions as well – particularly in the Very fine sand (well before the classical permanent wilting point of 15, 000 cm). The effects were more modest in Loamy sand where plants (particularly sorghum) survived well beyond the classical wilting point. Both sorghum and maize extracted greater amounts of water from the Loamy sand than from the Very fine sand, and sorghum extracted more water from both soil types than did maize. Chapter 6 explores how soil properties combined with plant response can be used to calculate the IWC. In the first instance, the model of Grant et al. (2010) was applied to obtain the relative hydraulic conductivity of the two soils, which provided useful parameters to develop a simple weighting function for the water capacity. The functional form was based on two factors: the shape of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and the soil matric <b>suctions</b> at which <b>plants</b> experienced the onset of water stress and then cessation of transpiration. The IWC’s predicted by applying this weighting function were closer to the actual amounts of water extracted by the plants than were the IWC’s produced in Chapter 5, and were more accurate in the coarser of the two soils, the Very fine sand. The combination of soil and plant factors in predicting IWC appears to produce superior estimates than either soil or plant factors alone. Chapter 7 draws some general conclusions, highlights the implications of the work conducted in this study and identifies potentially fruitful lines of future research. Thesis (Ph. D.)
