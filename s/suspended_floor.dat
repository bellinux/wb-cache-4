Especially, the higher the heat capacity of surface material is, the more the room air temp lags behind the surface temp. 2) It is important to select the floor finishing material for a passive solar direct gain. The percentage of thermal admission to the ground via floor construction depends on the surface finish material. 3) In the case of the slab on grade foundation floor construction, 75 to 80 % on wood flooring or on carpet flooring, approximately 83 % of concrete finishing are dissipation to the residential room side. 4) The performance of gained solar heat dissipation of the <b>suspended</b> <b>floor</b> with vertical edge insulation on foundation wall is fallen off 10 to 20 % compare to the floor of slab on grade foundation. 5) In the case of insulated foundation method, the height of the crawl space is less influence to the thermal performance in the crawl space.

40|$|International Standard ISO 13370 “Thermal {{performance}} of buildings — Heat transfer via the ground — Calculation methods” provides {{a method to}} calculate the R-value of a <b>suspended</b> <b>floor.</b> The method is a modification of a methodology first published in the CIBSE Environmental Design Guide A - 1998.

This paper deals with the ventilation component of the ISO 13370 calculations. This component would seem to have its origins in an infiltration model developed during the late 1970 s and early 1980 s by Max Sherman and others at LBL.

This is particularly important when steeply sloping sites are involved and for different soil types. The paper undertakes a study that quantitatively assesses the cumulative greenhouse gas emissions caused by cut and fill excavation on 52 residential projects in Australia for a range of slope and soil types. The paper presents results from the study and concludes that greenhouse gas emissions increase as site slope increases; the building footprint area (as distinct from Gross Floor Area), exposes the need to reduce the area of the building to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; excavation of rock soils creates higher emissions than other soil types; and cut and fill excavation on steeply slope sites increase emissions.

Furthermore, it sometime leads to condensation {{on the surface of}} the material, so that the mold and thus durability problem emerged. This is because continuous concrete foundation interrupts to effective ventilation in the crawl space to keep good hygrothermal condition, especially in moderate and high humid climate in Japan. Thermal insulation under the <b>suspended</b> <b>floor,</b> from energy conservation of view, also accelerates to make temperature in the crawl space lower. Under such a background, vertical edge insulation method on foundation wall has some priority such as not to keep moisture problem in the crawl space, and also no need vent opening on foundation wall so that high humid air can not be introduced. Simulation Code for estimating hygrothermal {{behavior in}} the crawl space insulated on foundation wall has developed in this study. The infiltration air through leakage has much influence on the moisture absorption and desorption of the building material exposed to the crawl space, so that the simultaneous heat and moisture transfer in the multilayer structure is taken into consideration.

A model, by its nature, is a simplified representation of the complex real-life structure. The more accurately the model represents the real-life structure, the more precise the performance could be obtained. Based on {{the purpose of the}} modelling process, different guidelines suggest different techniques to idealize structures. In the case of estimating vi-bration serviceability level of floor structures, current-state-of-the-art design guidelines provide a list of standard modelling assumptions. One of those is about modelling the boundary conditions of the floor, where only one level of columns above and below the floor are modelled with the assumption of rigid support re-gardless of the floor level being modelled (i. e. top or bottom floors in a multistorey building are modelled in the same way). This paper presents a pilot study to investigate the effects of modelling the full support frame of the building, including foundations, on the dynamic properties of floor structures. Different finite element (FE) models of the same <b>suspended</b> <b>floor</b> structure are used to present the methodology.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was part of}} a greater research initiative regarding the seismic vulnerability of precast hollowcore floor systems. The primary focus throughout the research programme has been to investigate the susceptibility to loss of vertical support of the floor system, from the seating beam. Previous research firstly focussed on identifying and understanding preconceived deficiencies with existing seating connection details. This was followed by the validation of amended, superior performing, 'new' seating connection details. However, little consideration has been given to retrofit techniques for already existing buildings, with potentially poor performing existing seating connections. A two-dimensional, single hollowcore unit, seating connection sub-assembly is used to experimentally investigate the seismic behaviour of previously un-tested existing seating connections pre- and post-retrofit. Three existing seating connection configurations, with the hollowcore unit seated directly on the bare concrete seating ledge and with varying seating lengths were tested. These tests were followed by a fourth retrofitted specimen. Both relative rotation between the hollowcore unit and seating beam, and beam elongation 'pull-off' deformations (resulting from the supporting frame deformations) were imposed on the test specimens. In conjunction with this experimental investigation and with prior knowledge from previous investigations, three primary failure mechanisms for existing hollowcore seating connections are summarised. A suite of conceptual retrofit techniques which target the critical structural weaknesses attributed to causing the primary failure mechanisms are outlined. In general, unfavourable performance was exhibited by the existing seating connections in the experimental investigation, resulting in loss of vertical support of the hollowcore unit under imposed 'pull-off' effects. In contrast, when the retrofit strategy was implemented, a higher level of seismic performance, leading to collapse prevention was achieved. A review is carried out into existing beam elongation numerical models, which are simple and involve only hand-type calculation procedures. The aim of this was to investigate potential methods for predicting the 'pull-off' effects on <b>suspended</b> <b>floor</b> systems. From this, a modification is made to an existing, loading dependent method developed by Matthews (2004). The modified method aimed to more accurately represent the loading dependant nature of beam elongation (and the resulting 'pull-off' effects) as described by Lee and Watanabe (2003). A number of beam elongation predictions for a suite of experimental beam elongation data sets were carried out with the modified method. Good agreement was generally seen, both in terms of prediction of the magnitude of elongation and the shape of the elongation profile...|$|E
40|$|The {{temporary}} formwork {{system is}} one of the most important features of construction in terms of safety and economy, especially in multi-storey buildings for which post- tensioned slab structures are very common. However, general practices for formwork systems, including removal times, in both post-tensioned and reinforced concrete buildings, have to comply with the standards established for reinforced concrete structures. Although a recommended formwork removal times for reinforced concrete structures is specified in these standards such as in Table 5. 4. 2 (AS 3610), there is no such table which can be easily put into practice by the industry in post-tensioned structures. Nevertheless, some standards, such as AS 3600 and ACI 347 R, specify certain requirements for removal of the formwork system from under a post-tensioned slab. Post-tensioning causes the negative curvature of a slab segment to increase, which increases its cracking moment capacity in the service load range. This may allow formwork supports to be removed earlier from post-tensioned than from reinforced concrete structures. In order to improve current formwork operating practices in post- tensioned building construction, this study has examined the characteristics of reinforced and post-tensioned slabs during construction by taking extensive on-site measurements. Data was collected from two post-tensioned building constructions in Canberra, Australia  a residential 20 -storey building and a commercial low-rise building. The average slab load distribution on a typical suspended post-tensioned slab was determined by monitoring the prop forces, strains in the slab sections, deflections, and ambient and concrete slab temperatures over the construction period of four <b>suspended</b> <b>floor</b> levels. The slab load distribution is generally represented by the ratio of the applied load to the self-weight of the slab and is referred to as the slab load ratio (SLR). There are several methods for estimating the SLR for the reinforced concrete multi-storey building construction. However, very little work has been conducted in the area of SLR estimation for post-tensioned building construction. These SLR estimation methods are usually applied to all formwork systems adopted by the industry in building construction in order to validate decisions regarding the removal of formwork supports during construction. SLR estimation methods originally proposed for reinforced iii concrete structures are not necessarily appropriate to post-tensioned structures as they behave differently at the early age. This work proposes a new SLR estimation method designed specifically for post- tensioned structures. It is based on two methods: the Simplified Method used for reinforced concrete structures; and Kajewski's modified Method which has been proposed for post-tensioning structures (Kajewski 1998). An analysis of the collected data is reported and is used in proposing a new SLR estimation method, which is more suitable for post-tensioned structures. It is then applied to determine the load distributions of the post-tensioned slabs in the five most prominent types of formwork support systems. The fundamental concept of this new method is that, if the maximum applied load obtained from the calculated SLR does not exceed the cracking slab load capacity at the desired removal time, the temporary formwork supports may be removed. However, if it does, the slab needs to be supported longer to achieve sufficient strength. Applying the proposed SLR method in the five most commonly employed formwork systems has enabled suitable formwork removal times for post-tensioned multi-storey construction to be proposed. Under this proposal, the props or backprops at the lowest level of support for a suspended post-tensioned slab may be removed one to three days earlier than they are currently, depending on the type of formwork system used. These proposed removal times are validated by investigating the serviceable limits of the slabs: allowable deflection and cracking moment. The particular significance of this work for the construction industry is its potential for improving the economy and speed of construction. It also encourages the practice of applying more suitable shoring and reshoring removal time to post-tensioned construction. A table of prop removal time is provided for the use of post-tensioned structures to go along with AS 3610  Table 5. 4. 2 which is more suitable for traditional reinforced concrete construction. The proposed new SLR method offers a greater accuracy in determining the slab load distributions of post-tensioned structures in multi- storey building construction...|$|E

Because of the small nature of this optimum strength and the general predictions from the model, it was recommended that such aggregate (8 – 16 mm from Oji-River) be restricted to oversite concretes, columns and lintels of buildings of load bearing walls and a maximum storey of three; and it should never be used for slabs of <b>suspended</b> <b>floors,</b> retaining walls, bridges and culverts.
