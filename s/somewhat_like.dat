5|$|The {{spore print}} of E.frostii is olive brown. The spores are thick walled, smooth, and spindle shaped, with {{dimensions}} of 11–15 by 4–5µm. Longer spores up to 18µm long {{may also be}} present. The cap cuticle, or pileipellis, is made of a tangled layer of gelatinized hyphae that are 3–6µm wide. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are four spored and measure 26–35 by 10.5–11.5µm. Cystidia are non-fertile cells interspersed among the basidia, and they are prevalent in the hymenial tissue of E.frostii. These hyaline (translucent) cells measure 30–53 long by 7.5–14µm wide, and range in shape from <b>somewhat</b> <b>like</b> a spindle (tapering at each end, but with one end typically rounded) to subampullaceous—shaped <b>somewhat</b> <b>like</b> a swollen bottle.|$|E
5|$|Timema spp. {{differ from}} other Phasmatodea in that their tarsi have three {{segments}} rather than five. For stick insects, they have relatively small, stout bodies, {{so that they}} look <b>somewhat</b> <b>like</b> earwigs (order Dermaptera).|$|E

5|$|Archaeologist James Mellaart {{described}} the earliest bikini-like costume in Çatalhöyük, Anatolia in the Chalcolithic era (around 5600 BC), where a mother goddess is depicted astride two leopards wearing a costume <b>somewhat</b> <b>like</b> a bikini. The two-piece swimsuit {{can be traced}} back to the Greco-Roman world, where bikini-like garments worn by women athletes are depicted on urns and paintings dating back to 1400 BC.|$|E
5|$|The Quad Electrostatic Loudspeaker (ESL) is the world's first {{production}} full-range electrostatic loudspeaker, {{launched in}} 1957 by Quad Electroacoustics, {{then known as}} the Acoustical Manufacturing Co. Ltd. The speaker is shaped <b>somewhat</b> <b>like</b> a home electric radiator curved slightly on the vertical axis. They are widely admired for their clarity and precision, but known to be difficult speakers to run and maintain.|$|E
5|$|In the Chalcolithic era around 5600 BC, the mother-goddess of Çatalhöyük, a large ancient {{settlement}} in southern Anatolia, was depicted astride two leopards wearing a costume <b>somewhat</b> <b>like</b> a bikini. Two-piece garments worn by women for athletic purposes are depicted on Greek urns and paintings {{dating back to}} 1400 BC. Active women of ancient Greece wore a breastband called a mastodeton or an apodesmos, which continued {{to be used as}} an undergarment in the Middle Ages. While men in ancient Greece abandoned the perizoma, partly high-cut briefs and partly loincloth, women performers and acrobats continued to wear it.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after waking, red pandas clean their fur <b>somewhat</b> <b>like</b> a cat would, licking {{their front}} paws and then rubbing their backs, torsos, and sides. They also rub {{their backs and}} bellies {{along the sides of}} trees or rocks. Then they patrol their territories, marking with urine and a weak musk-smelling {{secretion}} from their anal glands. They search for food running along the ground or through the trees. Red pandas may use their forepaws alternately to bring food to their mouths or place food directly into their mouths.|$|E
5|$|The agaricoid {{species in}} Lactarius, Lactifluus, Multifurca, and Russula are readily {{distinguished}} from other gilled mushrooms by {{the consistency of}} their flesh, which is granular, brittle and breaks easily, <b>somewhat</b> <b>like</b> a piece of chalk. Russulaceae never have a volva, but a partial veil {{can be found in}} some tropical species. Gills are adnate to decurrent, and the colour of the spore print ranges from white to ochre or orange (with the brown-spored Lactarius chromospermus as an exception).|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit of}} Aiphanes species {{is usually a}} red, spherical, single-seeded drupe. A thin skin (or epicarp), which can be either smooth or spiny, covers the fleshy mesocarp, which is {{typically}} orange and sweet. The mesocarp of A.horrida {{has one of the}} highest reported carotene contents of any plant product and is also rich in protein. The endocarp, which encases the seed, is brown or black and very hard at maturity. Seeds are light brown with a thin seed coat (or testa) and white endosperm, which is sweet and tastes <b>somewhat</b> <b>like</b> coconut.|$|E

25|$|In the English version, Bast is a cat 'Goddess' who was {{rejected}} after rumor was spread {{that she was}} an evil monster. In the original, she is just a monsterish half-breed named Myohyang; discarded by family because of what she was. She {{plays a key role in}} the story as one of the main 'bad guys'. She teams up with Yuri (Ryang's psycho-ex) to plot to take down Fanta and Ryang, though she comments to Yuri at one point that she <b>somewhat</b> <b>likes</b> Fanta, but has to do what her 'mastuh' wants done. Her 'mastuh' is in fact Lady Oran/Oreadia.|$|R
5|$|Amanita onusta, {{commonly}} known as the loaded Lepidella or the gunpowder Lepidella, is a species of fungus in the Amanitaceae family of mushrooms. It is characterized by its small to medium-sized fruit bodies that have white to pale gray caps crowded with roughly conical, pyramidal, or irregular gray warts. The stipe is whitish-gray with woolly or wart-like veil remnants, and at the base is a spindle- or turnip-shaped base that is rooted somewhat deeply in the soil. The species is distributed in eastern North America, from Nova Scotia to Mexico, and may be found growing on the ground in deciduous forests, particularly those with oak, hickory and chestnut. Fruit bodies smell <b>somewhat</b> <b>like</b> bleaching powder, and their edibility is unknown, but possibly toxic.|$|E
5|$|Clathrus ruber is {{a species}} of fungus in the stinkhorn family, and the type species of the genus Clathrus. It is {{commonly}} known as the latticed stinkhorn, the basket stinkhorn, or the red cage, alluding to the striking fruit bodies that are shaped <b>somewhat</b> <b>like</b> a round or oval hollow sphere with interlaced or latticed branches. The fungus is saprobic, feeding off decaying woody plant material, and is often found alone or in groups in leaf litter on garden soil, grassy places, or on woodchip garden mulches. Although considered primarily a European species, C.ruber has been introduced to other areas, and now has a wide distribution that includes northern Africa, Asia, Australia, and North and South America. The species was illustrated in the scientific literature during the 16th century, but was not officially described until 1729.|$|E
5|$|The horses' senses {{are based}} on their status as prey animals, where they {{must be aware of}} their {{surroundings}} at all times. They have the largest eyes of any land mammal, and are lateral-eyed, meaning that their eyes are positioned on the sides of their heads. This means that horses have a range of vision of more than 350°, with approximately 65° of this being binocular vision and the remaining 285° monocular vision. Horses have excellent day and night vision, but they have two-color, or dichromatic vision; their color vision is <b>somewhat</b> <b>like</b> red-green color blindness in humans, where certain colors, especially red and related colors, appear as a shade of green.|$|E

50|$|Smith-Ewart theory {{does not}} predict the {{specific}} polymerization behavior when the monomer is <b>somewhat</b> water-soluble, <b>like</b> methyl methacrylate or vinyl acetate. In these cases homogeneous nucleation occurs: particles are formed without {{the presence or}} need for surfactant micelles.|$|R
50|$|Extra Innings's {{controls}} were <b>somewhat</b> primitive, <b>like</b> many baseball games from its era. For example, unlike modern baseball games, {{rather than the}} player choosing one player to move independently, moving the D-Pad will move all players {{in the field in}} unison.|$|R
5|$|The {{participants}} in a LARP physically portray characters in a fictional setting, improvising their characters' speech and movements <b>somewhat</b> <b>like</b> actors in improvisational theatre. This is distinct from tabletop role-playing games, where character actions are described verbally. LARPs may be played in a public or private area and may last for hours or days. There is usually no audience. Players may dress as their character and carry appropriate equipment, and the environment is sometimes decorated to resemble the setting. LARPs can be one-off events or {{a series of events}} in the same setting, and events can vary in size from a handful of players to several thousand.|$|E
5|$|The {{recognised}} metalloids {{have either}} pyrotechnic applications or associated properties. Boron and silicon are commonly encountered; they act <b>somewhat</b> <b>like</b> metal fuels. Boron {{is used in}} pyrotechnic initiator compositions (for igniting other hard-to-start compositions), and in delay compositions that burn at a constant rate. Boron carbide {{has been identified as}} a possible replacement for more toxic barium or hexachloroethane mixtures in smoke munitions, signal flares and fireworks. Silicon, like boron, is a component of initiator and delay mixtures. Doped germanium can act as a variable speed thermite fuel. Arsenic trisulfide As2S3 was used in old naval signal lights; in fireworks to make white stars; in yellow smoke screen mixtures; and in initiator compositions. Antimony trisulfide Sb2S3 is found in white-light fireworks and in flash and sound mixtures. Tellurium has been used in delay mixtures and in blasting cap initiator compositions.|$|E
5|$|Consistent {{accounts}} of Saruman's earlier history appear in Appendix B to The Lord of the Rings, {{first published in}} The Return of the King, and in the posthumously published The Silmarillion (1977) and Unfinished Tales (1980). All were written in the mid-1950s. Saruman, like Gandalf and Radagast the Brown, {{is one of five}} 'wizards', known as the Istari, who begin to arrive in Middle-earth circa two thousand years before the beginning of The Lord of the Rings. They are Maiar, envoys of the godlike Valar sent to challenge Sauron by inspiring the people of Middle-earth rather than by direct conflict. Tolkien regarded them as being <b>somewhat</b> <b>like</b> incarnate angels. Saruman initially travels in the east; he is later appointed head of the White Council and eventually settles at Gondor's outpost of Isengard. Fifty years before The Lord of the Rings, after his studies reveal that the One Ring might be found in the river Anduin near Sauron's stronghold at Dol Guldur, he helps the White Council drive out Sauron in order to facilitate his search.|$|E
5000|$|Film critic Dennis Schwartz <b>somewhat</b> <b>liked</b> the film, writing, [...] "Broadway's Harold Clurman {{takes his}} only stab at film directing, after {{the breakup of}} his Group Theatre, in this odd {{psychological}} thriller noted for its flowery dialogue and muddled story line ... It's penned by playwright Clifford Odets from a story by Cornell Woolrich. Though enjoyable {{by virtue of its}} distorted mise-en-scène, affection for NYC characters and its misplaced chatter, this is not art but run-of-the-mill film noir. Set in Manhattan, yet Deadline used no location shots but was filmed entirely in the studio's back lots. Cinematographer Nick Musuraca does a fine job creating an atmospheric scene of NYC's downtrodden and unhappy souls roaming the dark streets." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, MR8 became <b>somewhat</b> reformist <b>like</b> other leftist {{movements}} {{and a more}} moderate socialist group. It even supporting Lula's successful run for presidency in 2002 and later his government as well. At the same time, it increased its nationalist streak.|$|R
50|$|Apart from Raimon, {{other former}} members of Els Setze Jutges {{continued}} their careers successfully, including Guillermina Motta, Francesc Pi de la Serra, Maria del Mar Bonet, Lluís Llach and, especially, Joan Manuel Serrat. Other significant figures appeared <b>somewhat</b> later, <b>like</b> the Valencian Ovidi Montllor.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{the change}} in {{electron}} configuration, unbiunium {{is not expected to}} behave chemically very differently from its lighter congeners. A 2016 calculation on unbiunium monofluoride (UbuF) showed similarities between the valence orbitals of unbiunium in this molecule and those of actinium in actinium monofluoride (AcF); in both molecules, the highest occupied molecular orbital is expected to be nonbonding, unlike in the superficially more similar nihonium monofluoride (NhF) where it is bonding. Nihonium has the electron configuration 5f146d107s27p1, with an s2p valence configuration. Unbiunium may hence be <b>somewhat</b> <b>like</b> lawrencium in having an anomalous s2p configuration from relativistic effects that does not affect its chemistry: the bond dissociation energies, bond lengths, and polarisabilities of the UbuF molecule are expected to continue the trend down group 3. Hence lawrencium and unbiunium are expected to be similar to lutetium and actinium respectively, and not thallium and nihonium as would be expected from looking at their electron configurations. The Ubu–F bond is expected to be strong and polarised, just like for the lighter group 3 monofluorides.|$|E
5|$|In general appearance, {{the current}} {{operating}} line of SIR looks <b>somewhat</b> <b>like</b> an outdoor {{line of the}} New York City Subway. Since the 1960s, it has been grade separated from all roads, but it runs more or less at street level for a brief stretch north of Clifton, between the Grasmere and Old Town stations, and from south of the Pleasant Plains station to Tottenville, {{the end of the}} line. It uses NYC Transit-standard 600 V DC third rail power. Its equipment are R44 subway type cars that are specially modified with headlight dimmers, electric windshield defrosters, FRA Compliant cab signals and horns, and FRA regulation 223 required shatterproof glazing, and exterior mounted grab rails near the side doors. The cars were built in early 1973, {{at the tail end of}} the R44 order of subway cars for New York City Transit (the Staten Island R44s being the last cars built by the St. Louis Car Company). Heavy maintenance of the equipment is performed at NYCT's Clifton Shops. Any work that cannot be performed at Clifton requires the cars to be trucked over the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to the subway's Coney Island Complex shops in Brooklyn. The right-of-way also includes elevated, embankment and open-cut portions, and a tunnel near St. George.|$|E
5|$|Pistorius {{is always}} slow in {{starting}} a race because the flexible blades {{do not provide}} thrust out of the blocks. Pistorius must begin from an awkward position, swing his leg to the outside and pop straight up from the blocks to begin running, when the preferred method is to push off with horizontal force. For the first 30 meters of a race, he keeps {{his head down and}} takes short, quick strides. As he establishes a rhythm, he can raise his head and increase his speed. While some runners jog up and down, losing energy, Pistorius directs energy forward, looking <b>somewhat</b> <b>like</b> he is rolling on wheels. He also compensates for the adjustments ankles make on the turns, breaking the curves into short, straight lines. According to his coach Ampie Louw, Pistorius may {{be able to use the}} inward lean to generate force and come out of a turn going faster.|$|E
50|$|This {{shell is}} from a sea snail species Turbinella pyrum in the family Turbinellidae. This species is found living in the Indian Ocean and {{surrounding}} seas. The shell is porcelaneous (i.e. {{the surface of the}} shell is strong, hard, shiny, and <b>somewhat</b> translucent, <b>like</b> porcelain).|$|R
