25|$|Linda Dugeau and Dot Robinson co-founded Motor Maids with 51 {{members and}} a dream. She took {{interest}} {{in the idea of}} creating a women’s group in the 1930s and took the liberty to reach out to motorcycle dealerships, AMA clubs and fellow riders in search to find women riders who would take part in helping her form a motorcycle organization of females. Although the idea of forming a group took ten years before becoming reality it took Dugeau and her old friend Dot Robinson three of the ten years to find willing female participates to be considered as Motor Maid members. Once the organization found its <b>standing</b> <b>legs</b> the organization expanded quickly, and opportunities to showcase themselves at parades and other events approached them quickly because they had a distinctive image. The Motor Maids organization became very popular throughout the United States of America and president Dot Robinson and secretary Linda Dugeau were ecstatic with the movement they were creating.|$|E
40|$|Networks {{of sensors}} – {{interacting}} autonomously within its predefined conditions – {{are still a}} far vision of the new efforts called Sensor Web. The heterogeneity of sensor types, data formats, and communication protocols had lead to various distinct systems with very little interoperability in between. New efforts driven by the Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) community address those problems and provide interesting solution approaches. The Sensor Web Enablement initiative by the Open Geospatial Consortium aims at standardizing the entire sensor web process of sensor description, sensor discovery, sensor tasking, and access of data observed by sensors. This article will illustrate two important <b>standing</b> <b>legs</b> of current developments towards interoperable sensor webs: First the research questions addressed by research institutes and standardizing consortia, and second by open source software initiatives like 52 north that help to bundle developer capacities and therefore accelerate the entire process to set up interoperable sensor webs, which are – despite all efforts – still in its infancy...|$|E
30|$|The {{previous}} research regarding the gait planning of quadruped robot {{focuses on the}} sequence for lifting off and placing the feet, but neglects the influence of body height. However, body height affects gait performance significantly, such as {{in terms of the}} stride length and stability margin. We herein study the performance of a quadruped robot using the equivalent mechanism concept based on metamorphosis. Assuming the constraints between standing feet and the ground with hinges, the ground, <b>standing</b> <b>legs</b> and robot body are considered as a parallel mechanism, and each swing leg is regarded as a typical serial manipulator. The equivalent mechanism varies while the robot moves on the ground. One gait cycle is divided into several periods, including step forward stages and switching stages. There exists a specific equivalent mechanism corresponding to each gait period. The robot’s locomotion can be regarded as the motion of these series of equivalent mechanisms. The kinematics model and simplified model of the equivalent mechanism is established. A new definition of the multilegged robot stability margin, based on friction coefficient, is presented to evaluate the robot stability. The stable workspaces of the equivalent mechanism in the step forward stage of trotting gait under different friction coefficients are analyzed. The stride length of the robots is presented by analyzing the relationship between the stable workspaces of the equivalent mechanisms of two adjacent step forward stages in one gait cycle. The simulation results show that the stride length is larger with increasing friction coefficient. We herein propose a new method based on metamorphosis, and an equivalent mechanism to analyze the stability margin and stable workspace of the multilegged robot.|$|E

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{different}} forms of leg tremors exhibited while standing in patients with Parkinson disease (PD), and to determine if the type of leg tremor exhibited is indicative of prognosis or treatment response in PD patients. Methods: We studied the clinical characteristics of five PD patients (all women; mean age, 59 years, range, 53 – 64 years) with unilateral <b>standing</b> <b>leg</b> tremor as the initial manifestation of PD, including their electrophysiological findings and the results of long-term follow-up. Results: For each patient, parkinsonism either existed at the time of onset of the initial symptoms or developed later. Patient responses to drugs were generally good, but one patient showed a poor response to drugs, even though she had only a low frequency leg tremor. For two patients whom we could observe during the 10 -year follow-up period, neither the leg tremor nor parkinsonism was aggravated. Conclusions: There are two forms of unilateral <b>standing</b> <b>leg</b> tremor in PD. One form is high frequency, similar to the primary orthostatic tremor. The other is low frequency and similar to the parkinsonian resting tremor. Based on these observations, it appears that progression might be slow if PD patients have <b>standing</b> <b>leg</b> tremor as the initial manifestation...|$|R

5000|$|... battement frappé is a battement {{in which}} the foot moves from a flexed or 'cou-de-pied' {{position}} next to the ankle of the supporting leg, and extends out to a straight position quickly and forcefully, and by doing so hitting the floor (the so-called frappé). In the Russian school the foot is wrapped around the ankle, rather than flexed and does not strike the floor. In this case, the frappé comprises the working foot striking the ankle of the supporting leg. Battements frappés can be executed double, with beats alternating front and back of the <b>standing</b> <b>leg's</b> ankle before striking out.|$|R

40|$|The {{control system}} of the femur-tibia joint of the stick insect (Carausius tnorosus) shows {{different}} properties {{depending on whether the}} animal is standing or walking. The properties of the system were examined when the animal was walking on a treadwheel and when the examined leg rested on a platform fixed beside the wheel. The results show that the properties of the system in the <b>standing</b> <b>leg</b> of a walking animal {{are similar to those of}} a walking animal rather than those of the standing animal. This indicates that the state of the <b>leg</b> (<b>standing</b> or walking) does not seem to be controlled by the neural sub{{system of the}} leg itself but by a more generalized system, which differs in its properties depending upon whether the whole animal is standing or walking. Furthermore the results show how the behaviour of the system changes for the two alternative states...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} relationship between Skin Resistance Level (SRL) and one <b>leg</b> <b>standing</b> balance in healthy subjects. Sixty eight voluntary students from the University of Dumlupinar Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation school were participated to the study. One <b>leg</b> <b>standing</b> balance tests were measured on dominant and non-dominant leg in three positions; eyes open (60 sec), eyes closed (30 sec) and eyes open with head rotation (30 sec) with arms held comfortably at the side. SRLs were recorded with two surface electrodes by the Digital Multimeter (DT- 9923 B) tool during <b>standing</b> on one <b>leg.</b> Carbon electrodes were placed over the 5 metatarsus heads and heel with conductive gel. No statistically differences were between male and female groups in static and dynamic one <b>leg</b> <b>standing</b> test results (p> 0. 05). The final SRL values were statistically higher in non-dominant leg than dominant in both male and female subjects (p< 0. 05). The dynamic tests on dominant and non-dominant leg with eyes closed results were found statistically lower in subject`s foot base SRL higher than 100 kΩ than subject`s foot base lower than 100 kΩ (p< 0. 05). We concluded that the SRL is inversely proportion with dynamic balance and the non-dominant foot plantar SRL is higher than dominant foot. Subjects who have higher than 100 kΩ foot plantar SRL have lower one <b>leg</b> <b>standing</b> dynamic balance with eyes closed. Further studied should be investigated the relationships of the SRL and one <b>leg</b> <b>standing</b> balance in age decades and different pathologies...|$|R
