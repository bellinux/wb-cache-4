50|$|The {{density of}} wild {{animals in the}} valley is not high, but all the animals found are rare or endangered. A total 13 species of mammals are {{recorded}} for the park by CP Kala and its vicinity although only he sighted 9 species directly: northern <b>plains</b> <b>grey</b> <b>langur</b> Semnopithecus entellus, flying squirrel Petaurista petaurista, Himalayan black bear Ursus thibetanus (VU), red fox Vulpes vulpes, Himalayan weasel Mustela sibirica, and Himalayan yellow-throated marten Martes flavigula, Himalayan goral Naemorhedus goral, Himalayan musk deer Moschus leucogaster, Indian chevrotain Moschiola indica, Himalayan thar Hemitragus jemlahicus (VU) and serow Capricornis sumatraensis (VU). The tahr is common, the serow, goral, musk deer and bharal, blue sheep are rare. The common leopard Panthera pardus is reported from lower parts of the valley closer to the villages. Local people have also reported evidence of brown bear Ursus arctos and bharal or blue sheep Pseudois nayaur. A recent faunal survey in October 2004 has established the presence of snow leopard Panthera uncia (EN) in the national park. The area is within the West Himalayan Endemic Bird Area {{but there have been}} no surveys specific to the Valley. 114 species were seen in 1993 in Nanda Devi Park. Species frequently seen in the valley include lammergeier Gypaetus barbatus, Himalayan vulture Gyps himalayensis, yellow billed and red billed choughs Pyrrhocorax graculus and P. pyrrhocorax, koklass pheasant Pucrasia macrolopha, the nationally listed Himalayan monal pheasant Lophophorus impejanus, found in rhododendron thickets, scaly-bellied and yellow-nape woodpeckers Picus squamatus and P. flavinucha, great and bluethroated barbets Megalaima virens and M. asiatica, snow pigeon Columba leuconota and spotted dove Stigmatopelia chinensis. The area is relatively poor in reptiles: most often seen are the high altitude lizard Agama tuberculata, Himalayan ground skink Leiolopisma himalayana and Himalayan pit viper Gloydius himalayanus. Along with the flowers are wild bees and many species of butterfly which need to be more researched. A few of the more evident species are lime butterfly Papilio demoleus demoleus, common yellow swallowtail Papilio machaon, common Mormon Papilio polytes romulus, spangle Papilio protenor protenor and common blue apollo Parnassius hardwickei.|$|R

40|$|The {{golden langur}} (Trachypithecus geei) is an {{endangered}} endemic species of primate in Bhutan. Conservation {{of this species}} is addressed here through phylogeographic and habitat management tools. I hypothesize that rivers and mountains in Bhutan isolated a population of capped langurs (Trachypithecus pileatus) and that this population later speciated into the morphologically distinct golden langur. Trachypithecus, the genus to which both capped and golden langurs belong, spread north from a paleo-refuge in south China and Semnopithecus (<b>grey</b> <b>langurs)</b> spread east and northward from a refuge in south India. My results show that these two genera both arrived in Bhutan but could not mix since the Sunkosh River and Pelela range form a biogeographic barrier. Likewise, a population of capped langurs isolated from parental populations by rivers speciated into the distinct golden langur. I conducted field surveys covering {{the entire range of}} langurs in Bhutan, confirming the distribution and isolating barriers among the three <b>langurs.</b> <b>Grey</b> <b>langurs</b> and golden langurs are isolated from each other by the Sunkosh River and Black Mountain range in west Bhutan. In the east, the Manas river system (Manas-Mangde-Chamkhar) served as a barrier between golden and capped langurs. However, this barrier has been broken in the last 30 years due to the construction of bridges over the Chamkhar river. A hybrid zone was found and the implications are discussed. A cyt b phylogeny showed the <b>grey</b> <b>langur</b> of Bhutan grouping into a distinct clade with other congenerics of Semnopithecus. The south-Indian clade of <b>grey</b> <b>langurs</b> is more ancient, with the Bhutan and Nepal <b>grey</b> <b>langurs</b> having diverged later. The golden and capped langur from Bhutan grouped with Trachypithecus from South East Asia. Finally, I explore conservation of golden langur habitat in Bhutan and estimate available habitat at 3, 089 km 2 and an estimated population of about 6, 000 individuals. I also find that the most viable strategy for conservation of langur habitat is to give ownership of the forests to local people, with monitoring by the Department of Forestry...|$|R

The Jungle Safari Tour also begins in Monkey World. This open-top bus tour takes in part of Animal World in Safari style and also negotiates an off-road section with special effects.|$|R
25|$|Tigers are carnivores. They prefer hunting large {{ungulates}} such as chital, sambar, gaur, and to {{a lesser}} extent also barasingha, water buffalo, nilgai, serow and takin. Among the medium-sized prey species they frequently kill wild boar, and occasionally hog deer, muntjac and <b>grey</b> <b>langur.</b> Small prey species such as porcupines, hares and peafowl form a very small part in their diet. Because of the encroachment of humans into their habitat, they also prey on domestic livestock.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{six months}} ending in August 2009, the park earned revenue of Rs. 18.2 millions. From 1994 to 2001 some 423,000 people visited the park, 20% of them foreigners. For the 1998-2001 period average annual revenue was 280,000. Postage stamps bearing the images of four wild animals of Udawalawe were issued on 31 October 2007 in the series [...] "National Parks of Sri Lanka", {{featuring}} water buffalo, Sri Lankan elephant, ruddy mongoose and tufted <b>grey</b> <b>langur.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fauna: The {{forest cover}} in the park helps provide the ideal habitat for many wild animals. Chital (or spotted deer), rhesus macaque and bonnet macaque {{are some of the}} wild mammals that can easily be spotted roaming inside the park. Other large mammals found in the park are: black-naped or Indian hare, muntjac (barking deer), porcupine, Asian palm civet, chevrotain (mouse deer), Hanuman or <b>grey</b> <b>langur,</b> Indian flying-fox, sambar deer and leopard. One can also spot striped hyena or four-horned antelope.|$|R
2500|$|Resisting {{males and}} {{fighting}} back are important tactics some species use to counter male coercion. Many females try to vigorously shake off males to dislodge them and flee; this {{is seen in}} females sepsid flies [...] and diving beetles. Sepsids also try to bend their abdomen {{in such a way}} that males cannot copulate forcefully. Females are especially likely to fight back when they are protecting their offspring. This is seen in mountain gorillas, red howlers, and <b>grey</b> <b>langur</b> females, where males are often infanticidal.|$|R

5000|$|The Bacone style {{differs from}} the two other {{prevalent}} flat styles of Native painting of the time: <b>Southern</b> <b>Plains</b> style and the Studio style. The <b>Southern</b> <b>Plains</b> style had its origins in Plains hide painting and winter counts. After the decline of buffalo herds in the late 19th century, Plains painting shifted to Ledger art, which, under the stewardship of such artists as Silver Horn (1860/1-1940, Kiowa), evolved into easel art. <b>Southern</b> <b>Plains</b> flatstyle painting gained international fame with the Kiowa Six in 1928. The <b>Southern</b> <b>Plains</b> style is the most dynamic, action-based of these mid-20th-century painting styles.|$|R
50|$|In Guadalupe Mountains National Park, white-throated woodrat {{distribution}} may {{be limited}} more {{by the presence of}} Mexican woodrats (N. mexicana) and the <b>southern</b> <b>plains</b> woodrat (N. micropus) than by habitat limitations. In areas not inhabited by Mexican woodrats and <b>southern</b> <b>plains</b> woodrats, the white-throated woodrat constructed houses at bases of prickly-pears. In areas where white-throated woodrats and <b>southern</b> <b>plains</b> woodrats lived in close proximity, white-throated woodrat constructed houses under honey mesquite.|$|R
50|$|The Sri Lanka primate project still continues, {{now more}} than four decades later. It is {{recognized}} as being the most intensive long-term study of a wild population of primates, anywhere, ever. Dittus’ team tracks (among dozens of other variables) the life histories of some 4,500 macaques from birth to death, maintains matrilineal and patrilineal genealogies, documents migration between troupes and monitors the social rank and relations of each individual through time. His team has been engaged in similar long-term studies on the <b>grey</b> <b>langur</b> (Semnopithecus priam thersites) and the northern purple-faced leaf monkey (Semnopithecus vetulus philbricki) at the same site.|$|R
5000|$|Indian wolf is the {{keystone}} species of Nauradehi Wildlife Sanctuary. Other carnivores here include: Bengal tiger, Indian leopard, striped hyena, wild dog (Dhole), Bengal fox, Muggar crocodile, golden jackal, and bears. The tiger and the leopards are conspicuous by their absence though infrequent evidences are met with. Recently a tigress {{was found dead}} due to old age. Other fauna often seen is smooth Indian otter, sloth bear and Indian grey mongoose. Herbivores living here include: Four-horned antelope (Chousingha), nilgai (blue bull), chinkara (Indian gazelle), sambar deer, blackbuck antelope, barking deer, <b>grey</b> <b>langur,</b> rhesus macaque, chital (spotted deer) and wild boar.|$|R
5000|$|Mesopithecus ("middle monkey") is an extinct genus of Old World monkey {{that lived}} in Europe and western Asia 7 to 5 million years ago.
