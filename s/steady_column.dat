40|$|The {{energy for}} driving {{turbulent}} flows in planetary fluid layers {{comes from a}} combination of thermocompositional sources and the motion of the boundary in contact with the fluid through mechanisms like precessional, tidal, and librational forcing. Characterizing the resulting turbulent fluid motions are necessary for understanding many aspects of the planet's dynamics and evolution including the generation of magnetic fields in the electrically conducting fluid layers and dissipation in the oceans. Although such flows are strongly inertial they are also strongly influenced by the Coriolis force whose source is in the rotation of the body and tends to constrain the inertial effects and provide support for fluid instabilities that might in-turn generate turbulence. Furthermore, the magnetic fields generated by the electrically conducting fluids act back on the fluid through the Lorentz force that also tends to constrain the flow. The goal of this dissertation is to investigate the characteristics of turbulent flows under the influence of mechanical, convective, rotational and magnetic forcing. In order to investigate the response of the fluid to mechanical forcing, I have modified a unique set of laboratory experiments that allows me to quantify the generation of turbulence driven by the periodic oscillations of the fluid containing boundary through tides and libration. These laboratory experiments replicate the fundamental ingredients found in planetary environments and are necessary for the excitation of instabilities that drive the turbulent fluid motions. For librational forcing, a rigid ellipsoidal container and ellipsoidal shell of isothermal unstratified fluid is made to rotate with a superimposed oscillation while, for tidal forcing, an elastic ellipsoidal container of isothermal unstratified fluid is made to rotate while an independently rotating perturbance also flexes the elastic container. By varying the strength and frequencies of these oscillations the characteristics of the resulting turbulence are investigated using meridional views to identify the dominate modes and spatial location of the turbulence. For the first time, measurements of the velocity in the equatorial plane are coupled with high resolution numerical simulations of the full flow field in identical geometry to characterize the instability mechanism, energy deposited into the fluid layer, and long-term evolution of the flow. The velocities determined through laboratory and numerical simulations when extrapolated to planets allow me to argue that that the dynamics of mechanical forcing in low viscosity fluids may an important role as new and potentially large source of dissipation in planetary interiors. To study convective forcing, I have modified and performed a set of rotating and non-rotating hydrodynamic convection experiments using water as well as rotating and non-rotating magnetohydrodynamic convection in gallium. These studies are performed in a cylindrical geometry representing a model of high latitude planetary core style convection wherein the axis of rotation and gravity are aligned. For the studies using water, the <b>steady</b> <b>columns</b> that are characteristic of rotating convection and present in the dynamo models are likely to destabilize at the more extreme planetary parameters giving way to transitions to more complex styles of rotating turbulent flow. In the studies of liquid metal where the viscosity is lower, the onset of rotating convection occurs through oscillatory columnar convection well below the onset of <b>steady</b> <b>columns.</b> Such oscillatory modes are not represented at the parameters used by current dynamo models. Furthermore a suite of laboratory experiments shows that the imposition of rotational forces and magnetic forces both separately and together generate zeroeth order flow transitions that change the fundamental convective modes and heat transfer. Such regimes are more easily accessible to laboratory experiments then to numerical simulations but demonstrate the need {{for a new generation of}} dynamo simulations capable of including the fundamental properties of liquid metals as are relevant for understanding the dynamics of planetary interiors...|$|R

40|$|In {{nuclear fusion}} {{reactors}} based on magnetic confinement, {{the interactions between}} the hot plasma and the reactor wall are very severe [1]. The wall materials face extreme temperatures and heat fluxes, and are constantly bombarded by ions, leading to erosion and degradation of the surface.

It occurs frequently but receives little attention in research due to difficulty in obtaining the real flight data. The aim {{of this paper is to}} discover key flight parameter features of long landing incidents by analyzing Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data and put forward prevention measures from the perspective of pilot operation at the same time. First, 73 flight performance parameter variables and 4 operation parameter variables were defined, covering major landing stages from 1500 ft to touchdown. Then 128 cases of selected QAR data were divided into two groups according to the threshold of identifying normal and long landing. Second, each flight parameter variable of these 128 flights was compared between groups and then the logistic and linear regression models were developed respectively to further examine the links between touchdown distance and these flight parameter variables. Third, potential flight operation causing performance difference of long landing incidents was also analyzed. Finally results indicate that the period of 200 ft to touchdown is the key stage of landing and flare is the most critical operation affecting touchdown distance. It is suggested that the pilot should inspect the ratio of descent rate and groundspeed carefully at the height of 50 ft and pilot&# 39;s faster and <b>steady</b> pulling up <b>columns</b> is probably helpful for an excellent flare and landing. The findings are expected to be applied into flight operation practice for further preventing long landing incidents and even the runway excursion accidents. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A vadose zone leaching, {{saturated}} zone mixing, and groundwater flow (VG) model was {{developed as a}} “user friendly” model with extensive use of Graphic User Interface and the capability of simulating vertical heterogeneity aquifer. A 1 -D finite difference scheme was employed for solving the leaching equation in a vertically heterogeneous vadose zone. The transport processes, including liquid-phase advection, liquid- and vapor-phase dispersion, sorption, and decay of contaminant, were taken into account. The transport processes in all the phases were combined together in one equation under the assumption of the instantaneous linear equilibrium partitioning relationships. This not only provided more consistent formation, but also was computationally more efficient since only one differential equation needed to be solved.

40|$|This paper aims {{mainly to}} provide {{experimental}} {{evidence of the}} consequences of urban wastewater reuse in irrigation practices on the hydrological behavior of soils. The effects on both the hydraulic and dispersive properties of representative soils in southern Sardinia are illustrated. Ten undisturbed soil monoliths, 120 cm in height and 40 cm in diameter, were collected from plots previously selected through a soil survey. Soil hydraulic and solute transport properties were determined before and after application of wastewater using transient water infiltration and <b>steady</b> state-solute transport <b>column</b> experiments. Detailed spatial–temporal information on the propagation of water and solute through the soil profiles were obtained by monitoring soil water contents, u; pressure heads, h; and solute concentrations, C; measured by a network of time domain reflectometry probes, tensiometers and solution samplers horizontally inserted in each column at different depths. A disturbed layer at the soil surface, which expands in depth with time, was observed, characterized by reduced soil porosity, translation of pore size distribution towards narrower pores and consequent decrease in water retention, hydraulic conductivity and hydrodynamic dispersion. It is shown that these changes occurring in the disturbed soil layer, although local by nature, affect the hydrological behavior of the whole soil profile. Due to the disturbed layer formation, the soil beneath never saturates. Such behavior has important consequences on the solute transport in soils, as unsaturated conditions mean higher residence times of solutes, even of those normally characterized by considerable mobility (e. g. boron), which may accumulate along the profile. The results mainly provide experimental evidence that knowledge of the chemical and microbiological composition of the water is not sufficient to evaluate its suitability for irrigation. Other factors, mainly soil physical and hydrological characteristics, should be considered in order to define appropriate guidelines for wastewater management...|$|R

Lack of equitable units precluded a comparison of attached and unattached biomasses in the fractured columns where the attached biomass was expressed per unit of surface area. Compositional differences in the attached and unattached communities were evidenced by (i) the recovery of Pseudomonas stutzeri, an Enterococcus sp., and Bacillus psychrophilus from the groundwater and not from the basalt, (ii) differences between community carbon source utilization patterns, and (iii) the relative abundances of different phylogenetic groups estimated by FISH in both column types.

40|$|In this {{research}} project the bubble street behaviour and stabihty {{of a high}} viscous (77 = 31, 47, 61, 99 mPas) laminar bubble column is studied (diameter 23 cm, height 80 cm), using gas flow rates of Qd = 23. 6 and 36. 7 cm^ 3 /s. The Hquid is a solution of PVP powder in tap water. The Reynolds numbers, based on the maximum liquid velocity and the bubble street diameter, vary from 190 to 540. The investigation has two goals. The first is to compare the Rietema k Ottengraf theory [1] concerning a circulating <b>steady</b> state bubble <b>column</b> to experimental results. The second is to make an inventory of the transition traject to a chaotic laminar ('normal') bubble column. Laser Doppler measurements were performed on the hquid, together with visual observations. The high concentration of PVP-particles solved in the liquid causes a large standard deviation in the velocity measurements, while the mean values are unbiased. In the circulating regime the flow has quite a smooth proflle with a very regular bubble pattern. The bubbles move via fixed patterns through the liquid. However, both the axial velocity and the hquid fiow rate increase with height. Assuming an axisymmetrical flow, the liquid fiow must have a radial component, {{which means that the}} flow cannot be one dimensional. The radial flow causes the bubbles to move to the centre of the column. The position of the zero velocity in the axial hquid profile is almost constant over the height, even though the bubble street (based on the bubble positions) narrows. In the transition regime the fiow develops from a bubble street in {{the lower part of the}} column to a chaotic regime in the upper part. Two mechanisms control the transition. The drafting-kissing-tumbhng mechanism according to Fortes et al. [2] for bubble pairs is the first. The second is a mechanism that causes waving and oscillating bubble chains.

40|$|The South Auckland {{volcanic}} field hosts 82 volcanic centres over an area {{of approximately}} 300 km 2 in the Pukekohe, Bombay, Tuakau, Pukekawa and Onewhero regions. The intraplate, monogenetic basaltic volcanic field was active between 1. 59 and 0. 51 Ma, and produced scoria cones, basaltic lava flows, tuff rings and maars. Three volcanic centres have been studied {{for the purpose of}} this thesis: the Kellyville volcanic complex, the Onewhero tuff ring and the Bombay volcanic complex. Each centre hosts a tuff ring and varying levels of associated magmatic activity, and has been studied through stratigraphic logs, facies analysis and componentry studies to illustrate the styles of eruptions and their controlling factors. The Kellyville volcanic complex hosts a breached tuff ring and two intra-tuff ring scoria cones. The tuff ring facies identified include a lithic-rich block and bomb facies with a massive fine lapilli to block and bomb facies, and a cross bedded coarse and fine ash facies with a laminated alternating coarse and fine ash facies, dominant in the early and late stages of the eruption, respectively. The aquifer for the tuff ring eruption was the Mercer Sandstone of the Waitemata Group. Both fall and surge processes occurred, with surges becoming dominant towards the end of the tuff ring eruption. Grainsize decreased through the eruption due to an increase in water/magma ratio and a decrease in magma ascent rate and eruption energy. The Onewhero tuff ring is the largest in the South Auckland volcanic field, and hosts a tuff ring with a separate lava flow on its outer flanks. The tuff ring facies identified include a well sorted, cross bedded alternating fine and coarse ash facies dominant in both the early and late stages of the eruption, and a poorly to very well sorted, fine ash to block and bomb facies present in discrete pulses. The aquifer for the tuff ring eruption was the ancestral Waipa/Waikato River and its alluvial sediments. Both fallout and surge processes occurred, with surges becoming dominant towards end of the tuff ring eruption. Grainsize was constant through the eruption due to a steady water/magma ratio and a stable interaction between magma and water. The Bombay volcanic complex hosts at least one tuff ring, a tuff cone, numerous scoria and spatter cones and at least two large deposits of ponded basalt lava. The tuff ring facies identified include a well sorted coarse ash to fine lapilli facies dominant in both the early and late stages of the eruption, and a poorly sorted coarse lapilli facies which occurs intermittently throughout the eruption. The aquifer for the tuff ring eruption was the Mercer Sandstone of the Waitemata Group. Fallout from <b>steady</b> eruption <b>column</b> was dominant in the tuff ring eruption. Grainsize decreased through the eruption due to a highly efficient water/magma ratio and an increase in ascent rate and eruption fragmentation. The eruption style of volcanism in the South Auckland volcanic field is largely controlled by the distribution of faults, as well as the interaction of differing magma supplies and ascent rates with water-bearing sedimentary rocks and surface water of the ancestral Waipa/Waikato River...|$|R

Ruapehu, New Zealand: Lithostratigraphic tools to understand subplinian-plinian eruptions at andesitic volcanoes. " Bulletin of Volcanology 74 (3) : 617 - 640. A new detailed stratigraphy {{was developed for}} a sequence of pyroclastic deposits including the largest known eruptions associated with Mt. Ruapehu, deposited in the period ~ 27 - 10 ka BP cal. From the largest Plinian eruption deposits in this sequence, subtle lithofacies variations within componentry, pumice textures and sedimentary features were used to identify a systematic change in eruptive conditions over time. Early eruptions involved <b>steady</b> eruption <b>columns,</b> while younger eruptions involved unsteady, collapsing columns. Isopach and Isopleth (pumice and lithic) mapping of most widespread and distinctive units show that the largest explosive eruptions known from this volcano attained peak column heights between 22 and 37 km, with mass discharge rates reaching 107 - 108 kg/s. To characterise the conditions controlling the style of Plinian eruptions at this andesitic volcano, and to explain the systematic variation in column stability over time, five key units were sampled in detail, exemplifying the major contrasting lithofacies. The sampled tephras underwent grain-size analysis, along with quantification of componentry, porosimetry and density on particles {{of a range of}} size classes, as well as 2 D and 3 D microtextural analyses of juvenile pumice clasts to define vesicularity and crystallinity. In addition, physiochemical factors such as melt-evolution and volatile-contents were determined by analysing bulk pumice, glass-inclusions and residual glasses with electron microprobe and FTIRspectroscopy. Bulk compositions of these tephras vary from basaltic-andesite to andesite (56 - 62 wt. %, SiO 2), and had minimum pre-eruptive H 2 O contents of 4 - 5 wt. %. The evolution of eruption behaviour over time was not correlated to any progressive change in bulk geochemical properties, but instead resulted from variations in physical processes within the conduit. Ascending magmas experienced heterogeneous bubble nucleation, and later-erupted units showed increasing degrees of rheological heterogeneities developed across the conduit. Differences between units were due to changes in the magma decompression rates, the degree of bubble-crystal-melt interactions and bubble shearing, as well as the composition of the residual melt. Conditions that led to the most variable physical states of the magma reaching the fragmentation level resulted in the highest variability in pumice textures, the greatest range in styles of fragmentation, and the most unstable eruption columns. A new model describing the pre-eruptive magma storage region, conduit processes, magma fragmentation, and pyroclastic dispersal during Plinian eruptions at Mt. Ruapehu is proposed. This hypothesises that eruption column unsteadiness and collapse occurs when magma shear reaches extreme levels along the conduit under conditions of low isolated porosity (< 3 vol. %). This situation also generates the worst-case hazard scenarios expected for Ruapehu, eruptions, where Plinian columns of over 30 km may produce widespread tephra fall, as well as partially collapse to generate pyroclastic density currents of over 15 km runout...|$|R
