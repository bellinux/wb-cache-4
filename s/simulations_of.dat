5|$|The {{study of}} stars and stellar {{evolution}} is fundamental {{to our understanding of}} the Universe. The astrophysics of stars has been determined through observation and theoretical understanding; and from computer <b>simulations</b> <b>of</b> the interior.

A sufficiently dense, and hot, core region will trigger nuclear fusion, thus creating a main-sequence star.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{modified}} Jominy-test {{was designed}} for prediction of hardenability of high-hardenability tool steels and possibility of application of modified Jominy-test in computer <b>simulation</b> <b>of</b> quenching of high-hardenability tool steels has been investigated. Because of high hardenability there are limits in application of original Jominy-specimen in <b>simulation</b> <b>of</b> quenching of steels. The performance of investigated modified Jominy-test in <b>simulation</b> <b>of</b> quenching of high-hardenability tool steels was estimated by comparison of cooling curves of modified Jominy-specimen (JM®-specimen) and cylindrical specimen. The influence of dimension of JM®-specimen on cooling curves has been investigated. The time of cooling, t 8 / 5 relevant for results of quenching was predicted. Modified Jominy-test can be applied in <b>simulation</b> <b>of</b> quenching of steel with higher hardenability rather than original Jominy-test...|$|R
