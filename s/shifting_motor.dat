For {{developing}} {{motor driven}} automated mechanical transmission of hybrid electrical vehicle, adjust {{and control the}} gear selecting motor, the gear <b>shifting</b> <b>motor</b> and the clutch motor. In the research of position-PID controller and robust disturbance observer, an automated mechanical transmission system based on position-PID was given. With Matlab, the position-PID controlling arithmetic and the controlling system models of the motors were built.

40|$|Typically, the apraxic {{deficit of}} {{patients}} with left hemisphere damage is more pronounced for complex, i. e., sequential actions, than for simple ones. This impaired action sequencing {{can be attributed to}} a faulty selection of movements, a deficit of <b>shifting</b> <b>motor</b> attention, or, alternatively, disturbed processing of action-related temporal information. Twenty patients with lesions of the left hemisphere with and without apraxia and 20 patients with right hemisphere lesions with and without neglect were asked to detect errors in the sequential structure or the spatial configuration of object-related complex actions, visually presented as actions with objects or pantomimes. As expected, both patients with apraxia and neglect performed worse than patients without neuropsychological deficit (or elderly control subjects, n = 10). Side of lesion per se did not influence error rate. In contrast, left hemisphere-damaged patients with apraxia showed a specific deficit in detecting errors in the sequential structure of complex pantomime actions. In accordance with functional imaging studies showing an involvement of the left parietal cortex in movement-related temporal processing, lesion analysis of the patients with left hemisphere lesions revealed that damage to the inferior parietal cortex (angular gyrus) was associated with this specific impairment in detecting sequential errors in pantomime action. The data suggest that impaired processing of temporal movement information due to lesions of the left inferior parietal cortex contributes to the complex action sequencing deficit in apraxia...|$|E
40|$|Although motor deficits {{are common}} in autism, the neural {{correlates}} underlying the disruption of even basic motor execution are unknown. Motor deficits may {{be some of the}} earliest identifiable signs of abnormal development and increased understanding of their neural underpinnings may provide insight into autism-associated differences in parallel systems critical for control of more complex behaviour necessary for social and communicative development. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine neural activation and connectivity during sequential, appositional finger tapping in 13 children, ages 8 – 12 years, with high-functioning autism (HFA) and 13 typically developing (TD), age- and sex-matched peers. Both groups showed expected primary activations in cortical and subcortical regions associated with motor execution [contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex, contralateral thalamus, ipsilateral cerebellum, supplementary motor area (SMA) ]; however, the TD group showed greater activation in the ipsilateral anterior cerebellum, while the HFA group showed greater activation in the SMA. Although activation differences were limited to a subset of regions, children with HFA demonstrated diffusely decreased connectivity across the motor execution network relative to control children. The between-group dissociation of cerebral and cerebellar motor activation represents the first neuroimaging data of motor dysfunction in children with autism, providing insight into potentially abnormal circuits impacting development. Decreased cerebellar activation in the HFA group may reflect difficulty <b>shifting</b> <b>motor</b> execution from cortical regions associated with effortful control to regions associated with habitual execution. Additionally, diffusely decreased connectivity may reflect poor coordination within the circuit necessary for automating patterned motor behaviour. The findings might explain impairments in motor development in autism, as well as abnormal and delayed acquisition of gestures important for socialization and communication...|$|E

40|$|Autistic {{disorder}} (henceforth {{referred to}} as autism) and Asperger’s Disorder (AD) are neurodevelopmental disorders that share characteristic social deficits and repetitive and stereotyped behaviours and interests. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of MentalDisorders - Fourth edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR), AD is differentiated from autism {{on the basis of}} early language acquisition. However there has been considerable debate as to whether clinical separation of the two conditions is justified, particularly given the considerable overlap between those with autism who have normal intellectual ability (high functioning autism; HFA) and AD. It has been proposed that in the next revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, due to be released in 2013, that the two disorders be merged into a single autism spectrum disorder diagnostic category. Based on recent studies by Gibbs et al (2012), the proposed ASD diagnostic criteria will result in approximately 20 - 40 % of children who currently meet DSM-IV-TR criteria for autism or Asperger’s disorder not meeting diagnosis, despite having significant impairments. Therefore, ongoing research to more clearly define and understand the behavioural and neurobiological phenotypes of autism and AD will be important for creating an evidence base to contribute to future revisions of the DSM. Motor coordination difficulties are increasingly regarded as a commonly associated symptom of HFA and AD. Characterising and elucidating the mechanisms of motor coordination difficulties HFA and AD is essential to developing comprehensive definitions of these disorders, as well as tailoring of appropriate interventions. Furthermore, recent evidence has found subtle dissociation of the two groups based on a profile of motor function and neuroanatomical abnormalities. Behavioural and neuroimaging studies have implicated greater involvement of the cerebellum in the pathology of autism than in AD. Impairment of the cerebellar and fronto-striatal circuitry results in distinct changes to motor profiles. Therefore, such research has the potential to shed light on the neurobiological distinctiveness between autism and AD {{on the basis of a}} unique cerebellar-related motor profile. Accordingly, the central aims of this thesis were: 1. to use ocular motor performance and kinematic assessments of handwriting movements in order to further characterise motor abnormalities in HFA and AD 2. elucidate the contributions of the cerebellum and fronto-striatal circuitry in motor impairment in HFA and AD, and 3. to determine whether any differences exist between the two groups. Experiment 1 comprehensively characterized the profile of visually guided saccades. It was revealed that those with HFA showed greater eye movement inaccuracy across both small and large movement amplitudes, which was not observed in AD. In Experiment 2, a saccade adaptation paradigm was used to further investigate motor learning, through the refinement of eye movement precision and the role of visual feedback. This experiment confirmed slower refinement of eye movement accuracy in response to visual error in HFA. Furthermore, both HFA and AD were slower to respond to visual feedback, which was more pronounced in HFA than AD. Together the findings from Experiment 1 and 2 are consistent with greater disruption of the cerebellum in HFA than AD. Saccade accuracy (Experiment 1) and saccade correction time (Experiment 2) were significantly correlated with manual dexterity as measured by the Movement Assessment Battery for Children – 2 nd edition (MABC- 2). Findings from Experiments 3 and 4, which kinematically examined the control of handwriting, found that both children with HFA and AD are heavily reliant on visual cues in modulating the size and consistency of their movements. Experiment 3 revealed that while both children with HFA and AD were successfully able to scaled the size and trajectory of their handwriting movements, HFA showed an additional increase in movement velocity. Although handwriting movements remained accurate despite the increase in movement velocity, movement velocity was negatively correlated with manual dexterity and total motor performance as assessed by the MABC- 2. In Experiment 4, in which no visual guides were presented, both HFA and AD were unable to maintain the size and consistency of handwriting movements, and handwriting became macrographic (abnormally large). There were a greater number of perseverative errors and higher movement velocities in the HFA group compared to TD children. ADHD is another neurodevelopmental disorder that shares fronto-striatal abnormalities. However ADHD has a different clinical profile to HFA, characterised primarily by hyperactivity and inattention. Moreover, the motor profiles of the two disorders are also distinct: while HFA shows higher movement variability and difficulties <b>shifting</b> <b>motor</b> plans (as seen in greater numbers of perseverative errors), ADHD show impaired motoric inhibition and decreased cognitive control of motor behaviours. Both HFA and ADHD are known to have handwriting impairments, but standard treatment of handwriting difficulties currently uses a ‘one size fits all’ approach. Experiment 5, which used a naturalistic handwriting task, contrasted the profile of handwriting difficulties between HFA and ADHD. Experiment 5 revealed no difficulties with spelling and corrections in the HFA group, but rather with the spatial arrangement of letters and words within a sentence. By contrast ADHD showed increase spelling and correction errors, but no impairments in spatial arrangement. These findings help to further delineate the boundaries of the profile HFA and neurodevelopmental disorders. A summary of overall findings across both ocular motor and handwriting studies revealed that motor difficulties in both autism and AD may be underpinned by an overreliance on visual cues for controlling movement size, and impaired visual feedback mechanisms. Children with HFA were distinguishable from those with AD by greater inaccuracy of eye movements during simple, visually guided eye movements, slower movement correction time following to visual feedback and protracted ocular motor learning. These findings fit within the overarching hypothesis that subtle motor abnormalities may dissociate HFA and AD. Moreover, they are consistent with the hypothesis that while both conditions share deficits suggestive of frontal-basal ganglia abnormalities, HFA is characterised by additional motor abnormalities suggestive of additional disruption to cerebellar circuitry...|$|E

40|$|Many governments {{attempt to}} improve cycling safety {{to reduce the}} number of bicycle crashes and {{encourage}} cycling. The Netherlands is a world leader in bicycle use and safety. This paper explores how the Netherlands achieved an 80 % reduction in the number of cyclists killed (predominantly bicycle–motor vehicle crashes) per billion bicycle kilometres over a thirty year period. Factors found to contribute to this improvement include the establishment of a road hierarchy with large traffic-calmed areas where through traffic is kept out. A heavily used freeway network <b>shifts</b> <b>motor</b> vehicles from streets with high cycling levels. This reduces exposure to high-speed motor vehicles. Separated bicycle paths and intersection treatments decrease the likelihood of bicycle–motor vehicle crashes. The high amount of bicycle use increases safety as a higher bicycle modal share corresponds with a lower share of driving and greater awareness of cyclists among drivers. Low cycling speed was also found to contribute to the high level of cycling safety in the Netherlands. (Author/publisher...|$|R

However, studies from our laboratory recently demonstrated that in interactive social contexts this imitative tendency could turn into readiness to perform a dissimilar complementary action.

40|$|In {{the frame}} of this {{dissertation}} the evaluation of energy and efficiency parameters for the basic soil cultivation using showels with different edge thickness was carried out. Field evaluation of energy and efficiency parameters of sets for soil cultivation was done with tractor John Deer 7810 + combined loosener. The comparison of energy and efficiency parameters of the sets using showels having average edge thickness 2, 16 mm, 4, 17 mm and 6, 23 mm was done. Two variants of the engine performance A and B were selected. A variant: A full supply of fuel was selected, using <b>shift</b> gears the <b>motor</b> was kept in the revolution limit of 1600 - 2000 min- 1. B variant: Before the ride the fuel supply was set {{in the way that}} the revolutions of unloaded engine were 1800 min- 1. <b>Shifting</b> the <b>motor</b> gears the range of revolutions was 1600 - 1800 min- 1. <b>Shifting</b> the <b>motor</b> gears the range of revolutions was 1600 - 1800 min- 1. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the thickness of the loosener edge and the working regime of the tractor engine on energic and efficiency parameters. The data could be concluded in following way: By increasing the tension resistance due to the showel thickness by the determined working engine regimes the working speed was lowered and this way the efficiency of the working set as well; The fuel reduction and higher efficiency could be reached by the suitable selection of the shape and dimensions of the working machine parts used for soil cultivation and good technical working conditions; Areal efficiency by the fixed engine working regimes is influenced by the depth of cultivation, thus the value of energic parameters were calculated in the relation of the soil cultivated; Linear course of the edge thickness on the energy demand of the soil cultivation was proved by both laboratory and field tests; When suggesting a suitable set, i. e. the selection of suitable tractor for a given machine it is necessary to consider its working resistance and tension power in relation to the given soil conditions; From values obtained the so called economy regime, when the engine works with the specific fuel consumption, is obvious; When it is not possible to use full performance of the tractor engine it is convenient to change the working regime of the engine by lowering the fuel supply on the presumption that agrotechnical demands on the particular operations will be carried out. On the basic of the presented thesis with the aim of establishing the effect of edge thickness of the working parts of the loosener and effect of the tractor motor working regime on the energic demand of the soil cultivation some other questions appeared. Their study is the subject of future research. They are listed here: Study of the effects of the shape and dimension changes of the working parts of soil cultivation machinery on the energic demand of the given operation; Establishing the optimal working speed considering the quality of labour and minimal speed of wear; Establishing the minimal thickness of the soil machinery working parts edge considering the maximal durability of the working parts and minimal specific resistance; Establishing the optimal regime of the engine performance in relation to the fuel consumption and efficiency of the set.

Using the in situ arterially perfused juvenile rat preparation, we investigated whether the shift from eupnea to gasping was associated with a reconfiguration of the spatiotemporal pattern of respiratory neuronal activity in the ventral medullary respiratory network. Optical images of medullary respiratory network activity were obtained from male rats (4 – 6 weeks of age). Part of the medullary network was stained with a voltage-sensitive dye (di- 2 ANEPEQ) centred both within, and adjacent to, the pre-Bötzinger complex (Pre-BötC). During eupnea, optical signals initially increased prior to the onset of phrenic activity and progressively intensified during the inspiratory phase peaking at the end of inspiration. During early expiration, fluorescence was also detected and slowly declined throughout this phase. In contrast, hypoxia <b>shifted</b> the respiratory <b>motor</b> pattern from eupnea to gasping and optical signals were restricted to inspiration only. Areas active during gasping showed fluorescence that was more intensive and covered a larger region of the rostral ventrolateral medulla compared to eupnea.

Moreover, there was a recruitment of additional medullary regions during gasping that were not active during eupnea.

Five of the eleven patients with perilesional somatosensory representation of the affected hand showed contralesional <b>shifting</b> of <b>motor</b> function, thus exhibiting sensory-motor dissociation. Significant correlation was found between sensory deficit and fMRI activation during sensory stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: In subjects with early brain lesions, somato-sensory function is generally reorganised within the affected hemisphere. A contralesional shifting is uncommon and poorly efficient in function restoration. SIGNIFICANCE: This study confirms and further explores the difference in reorganisation capabilities of the motor and sensory system following early brain injury of different etiologies and timing...|$|R
40|$|My dear readers, Greetings {{from your}} National President, Govt. has {{realized}} {{that it is now}} the time to revive and boost manufacturing. The Prime Minister himself is discussing ways to shore up manufacturing. He has the agenda as a plan to manufacture commercial aircraft and to make advanced materials. Unless our manufacturing sector is stimulated, all the big growth dream will be in dream only. We {{may not be able to}} achieve all that we dream. But we will not achieve anything without dreaming says old adage. High inflation, depreciating rupee, high oil prices and sapped manufacturing sector, depressed export are the major set back impeding the projected growth. Maruti Suzuki India Chairman R C Bhargava, an auto Industry veteran admits that this is the worst period for Automobile Industry. Maruthi has moved to two shifts of diesel engine production from three <b>shifts.</b> Tata <b>Motors</b> has planned 4 to 5 days of no production days in July and Toyoto observed 8 days non production days in the earlier quarter and cut working hours from 8 to 6 hours for some days. At a time, when US and Europe are trying to wake up from slumber, Govt. May need to accelerate few reforms measure and have stimulus plan to revive Manufacturing...|$|R
5000|$|Following the {{experiment}} by Sutton et al. (1965), subsequent research further manipulated stimulus uncertainty {{in an attempt}} to elicit a more robust N200. The N200 has been found in a variety of different experimental conditions, and is now thought to consist of several subcomponents. The N200 in response to attended or unattended deviant auditory stimuli, similar to what was originally seen in Sutton et al. (1965), {{is referred to as the}} mismatch negativity. Additionally, there is the no-go N200, which is elicited on no-go trials in go/no-go tasks. [...] More generally, the N2 component has been described in tasks that reflect stimulus identification, attentional <b>shifts,</b> inhibition of <b>motor</b> responses, overcoming stereotypical responses or conflict monitoring, maintenance of context information, response selection timing, and detection of novelty or mismatch.|$|R
