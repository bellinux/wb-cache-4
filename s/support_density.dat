40|$|Density {{is a tool}} used by {{planners}} to predict, {{describe and}} control land use. Some national governments also <b>support</b> <b>density</b> through policy, such as Planning Policy Guidance 3 in the UK, which had a minimum target for dwelling density of 30 dwellings per hectare in new developments. Such targets may help promote more efficient use of land, reduce private transportation use and increase the mix of uses in an area.

This paper examines one such development site in Lancaster called Luneside East. The note begins by explaining the information available about density from local authority policy and guidance, both at the site and local scale. Missing policy information is discussed next, followed by an exploration of interdependencies between density and other sustainability issues.

On each orbit the density must be predicted to determine the appro-priate and safe depth within the atmosphere for the aerobraking passage sufficiently in advance to command MGS to adjust its orbit.

40|$|URL] The Central Valley of California {{provides}} important breeding habitat {{to numerous}} species of wetland-dependent birds, despite {{the loss of}} over 90 % of naturally occurring wetlands. A majority of shorebirds breeding in this region rely on shallow-flooded habitat adjacent to sparsely vegetated uplands as provided by rice (Oryza sativa), managed wetlands, and other habitats. We estimated the current extent of potential breeding shorebird habitat provided by rice and managed permanent and semi-permanent wetlands in each of four major planning regions of the Central Valley, and estimated the average breeding densities and current population sizes of two species of shorebirds: the Black-Necked Stilt (Himantopus mexicanus) and American Avocet (Recurvirostra americana). Using a population status framework based on principles of conservation biology, we estimated that stilt populations are small (< 10, 000 individuals) or very small (< 1, 000 individuals) {{in three of the}} four planning regions, and avocet populations are small or very small in all four planning regions. We then used the framework to define long-term (100 -year) population objectives for stilts, avocets, and a third species, Killdeer (Charadrius vociferous), designed to meet our long-term conservation goal of supporting self-sustaining, genetically robust, and resilient populations of breeding shorebirds in the Central Valley. We also estimated the long-term species’ density and wetland habitat objectives necessary to achieve the population objectives for all three species. The corresponding short-term (10 -year) conservation objectives are to restore semi-permanent wetlands to provide an additional 11, 537 ha (28, 508 ac) of habitat for breeding shorebirds (by planning region: 2, 842 ha in Sacramento, 2, 897 ha in Yolo–Delta, 2, 943 ha in San Joaquin, and 2, 855 ha in Tulare), and to enhance existing habitat to <b>support</b> <b>density</b> objectives.

40|$|Coal Operations Australia Limited Operates the Chain Valley, Wallarah and Moonee Collieries {{which are}} located in the Newcastle Coal Fields of New South Wales in the Catherine Hill Bay area {{approximately}} 100 km north of Sydney. Operations are in the Great Northern seam, which until recent years were all conducted under an immediate roof of a strong conglomerate. Large areas of the current reserves at all operations are in areas of a “claystone” immediate roof. All three mines have attempted at various stages of their history to find an economic mining method under these claystone roof conditions, with varying degrees of success at each operation. Moonee currently operates a longwall under claystone roof while Chain Valley and Wallarah are place-changing operations which have operated under claystone with some success. The nature of the “claystone” roof horizons in the three mines is often seen as different at each operation but in practice all of the claystones exhibit similar properties – low strength layers particularly at the coal-claystone interface. Strata control in conditions where the immediate roof above the coal seam is claystone appears to be most sensitive to coal beam thickness left as roof coal, roof bolting pattern and anchorage strength, drivage standards, horizontal stress direction, frequency and type of structures present, exposure time before bolting and possibly depth of cover. Coal beam thickness should be maximised wherever possible to achieve an optimum <b>support</b> <b>density.</b> Place-change mining using deep cuts up to 15 m has been successfully carried out under claystone and can be a productive mining method in this environment. There may be potential at Moonee Colliery to introduce place-changing as a method of remnant area mining or even as a gateroad development method. The most critical roof support issues in achieving high productivity under a claystone roof are the setting and maintenance of very high support installation standards {{and the development of a}} robust support management plan responsive to changes in strata conditions. This paper sets out to describe and discuss the various attempts to achieve economic success at each of the operations in a claystone roof environment...|$|E
