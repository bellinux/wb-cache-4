40|$|AbstractThe {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to determine the level of metacognitive awarness and level of academic achievement about simple machine, which is a basic subject in Primary Education Science and Technology Course, and to assess correlation between metacognitive awarness and academic achivement about simple machine. The study was conducted in the <b>second</b> <b>semester</b> of <b>2010</b> - 2011 education year with 7 th grade students of ten schools chosen randomly and located in Çankaya, Ankara. The quantative data obtained from the Metacognitive Awarness Inventory (MAI) and Academic Test about Simple Machine were analyzied using quantative analysis. In the quantitative analysis, frequency, mean, standard deviation, percentage, independent sample t-test and multiple lineer regression were used. In addition, the most convenient methods for each of the data were applied. At the end of the research a significant difference was detected in many variables. The analysis of data and diagnoises revealed the following;•The significant difference was found between both the academic achievements of girl students and boy students about simple machine which is basic subject in primary education science and technology [t(412) = 3. 08, p. 05]. •The positive and medium level correlation was establish between academich achievement about simple machine and metacognitive awarness (r=. 353, p< 0. 05). •Acording to analysis of multiple lineer regression, Metacognitive awarness clarify approximately % 13 of cumulative variance of academic achivements (R= 0. 353, R 2 = 126, p=<. 05) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} a measurement model {{used to measure}} the students’ performances in the Department of Civil and Structural Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Built Environment, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM). The assessment model was developed based on students mark entries together with Rasch Measurement Model; it can be {{used to measure the}} students’ performances in term of course outcomes (COs) for the Civil Engineering Design II Course (KH 4253). This assessment was conducted to all 64 final year students in the Department of Civil and Structural Engineering (JKAS), Faculty of Engineering and Built Environment, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia that have registered for the course in <b>second</b> <b>semester</b> of session <b>2010</b> / 2011. This study shows that Rasch Model can precisely classify and tabulates the students; i. e. Person and Items on a Distribution Map (PIDM) according to their achievements. Comparative analysis against the conventional distribution marks shows that Rasch Measurement Model was found to give almost the same results on the students’ achievement and reveals the true degree of learning abilities of the students even with small number of sampling unit...|$|R
40|$|Background : In every {{geographical}} area {{according to their}} social civilization, specific abnormalities and outcomes may be occurred in spinal cord {{and in the case}} of recognition they will be corrected with specific movements and proper behavioral patterns. So the aim of the present study was to investigate the rate and reasons of Khorramabad Azad university students’ spinal abnormalities. Materials and Methods: This descriptive- analytical survey was carried out on Khorramabad Azad university students in 2010 - 2011. Among 1400 students, 500 persons (250 women and 250 men) randomly selected from students who were studying in the <b>second</b> <b>semester</b> of <b>2010</b> - 2011. First, they filled out a questionnaire about their personal information, disease history and daily habits. Then, their weight, height, and spinal abnormalities were studied. New York standard test and grid plane were used to study spinal abnormalities. Also, flexible ruler was used to measure the curves of the thoracic and back vertebrates. Results: The findings of this research showed that 83. 2 % of males (208 persons) and 87. 2 % of females (218 persons) had at least one abnormality. The greatest abnormalities in males were associated with kyphosis and in females with shoulder drown. The least abnormality in males was abdomen drown (10. 4 %) and in females was upper extremity deviation (19. 2 %). Also significant association observed between lordosis and kyphosis and incorrect habits of sleeping, between incorrect habits of carring bag and instruments, and shoulder drown, incorrect habits of studying and poke neck and incorrect habits of sitting in the home and kyphosis (P< 0 / 01). Conclusion: Present study showed high incidence of spinal abnormalities of which incorrect habits in sitting, studying and caring bag and instruments, had a major role in each of these abnormalities...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} investigates the {{occurrence}} of communication and friendship among male and female university students of Sanandaj city by considering their personality traits (Neuroticism, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Openness, and Conscientiousness).
