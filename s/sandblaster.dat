40|$|Summary Silicosis which {{develops}} as a {{results of}} environmental and occupational silica inhalation is well-known. Although the disease is preventable, {{it continues to be}} a problem in our country and other developing countries. Causing silicosis, sandblasting has been a striking occupation last years. We presents two cases who develop silicosis because they worked as <b>sandblasters.</b> Case 1 and 2 : Both cases had worked at a denim factory in Istanbul. Case one had worked for 8 months and case two had worked for 2 years and ten months. Chest X ray and thorax high resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) revealed that there are bilateral reticulonodular and nodular opacities at the pulmonary paranchima. Silicosis was diagnosed by examining of open lung biopsy (case one) and transbronchial biopsy (case two). Because of changes in fashion, denim sandblasting has been occured as an occupation recently years. Workplaces sandblasting denim should be controlled.

40|$|Occupational {{exposure}} to respirable crystalline silica and to radiation emitted by natural radionuclides present both in rocks and sands was {{studied in the}} Brazilian extractive process and granite product manufacture. Respirable airborne dust samples were collected in working environments, where workers perform different tasks with distinct commercial granites types, and also in places where <b>sandblasters</b> work with sands from different origins. The free crystalline silica contents were determined using X-ray diffraction of the respirable particulate fraction of each sample. Dust samples from granite cutting and sandblasting ambient had the natural radionuclides concentrations measured by gamma spectrometry. Dust concentrations in the workplaces were quite variable, reaching values up to 10 {{times higher than the}} respirable particle mass threshold limit value (TLV) set by the American Conference for Governmental Industrial Hygienists of 3 mg m(- 3). Also the free crystalline silica concentrations were high. reaching values up to 48 times the TLV of 0. 025 mg m(- 3). Additionally, our results suggest that the risk of radiation-induced cancer in the granite or marble industries is negligible. However, the combined {{exposure to}} dust, gamma radiation, and radon daughter products could result in the enhancement of lung cancer risks associated to sandblasting activities.

40|$|Occupational {{exposure}} to heavy metals, organic solvents and silica {{is associated with}} a variety of renal manifestations. Improved understanding of occupational renal disease provides insight into environmental renal disease, improving knowledge of disease pathogenesis. Silica (SiO 2) is an abundant mineral found in sand, rock, and soil. Workers exposed to silica include <b>sandblasters,</b> miners, quarry workers, masons, ceramic workers and glass manufacturers. New cases of silicosis per year have been estimated in the US to be 3600 – 7300. Exposure to silica has been associated with tubulointerstitial disease, immune-mediated multisystem disease, chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease. A rare syndrome of painful, nodular skin lesions has been described in dialysis patients with excessive levels of silicon. Balkan endemic nephropathy is postulated to be due to chronic intoxication with drinking water polluted by silicates released during soil erosion. The mechanism of silica nephrotoxicity is thought to be through direct nephrotoxicity, as well as silica-induced autoimmune diseases such as scleroderma and systemic lupus erythematosus. The renal histopathology varies from focal to crescentic and necrotizing glomerulonephritis with aneurysm formation suggestive of polyarteritis nodosa. The treatment for silica nephrotoxicity is non-specific and depends on the mechanism and stage of the disease. It is quite clear that further research is needed, particularly to elucidate the pathogenesis of silica nephropathy. Considering the importance of diagnosing exposure-related renal disease at early stages, it is imperative to obtain a thorough occupational history in all patients with renal disease, with particular emphasis on {{exposure to}} silica, heavy metals, and solvents...|$|R

We aimed to describe the radiological features of patients exposed to silica during denim sandblasting and define factors related {{to the development of}} silicosis. Methods: Sixty consecutive men with a history of exposure to silica during denim sandblasting were recruited. All CT examinations were performed using a 64 -row multi-detector CT (MDCT). The nodules were qualitatively and semiquantitatively analyzed by grading nodular profusion (NP) on CT images. Results: Silicosis was diagnosed radiologically in 73. 3 % of patients (44 of 60). The latency period (the time between initial exposure and radiological imaging) and duration of silica exposure was longer in patients diagnosed with silicosis than in those without silicosis (p < 0. 05). Nodules were present in all cases with centrilobular type as the commonest (63. 6 %). All cases of silicosis were clinically classified as accelerated and 11. 4 % had progressive massive fibrosis (PMF). Mild NP lesions were the most prevalent in all six zones of the lung. The NP score was significantly correlated with the duration of silica exposure, the latency period, presence of PMF, and pleural thickening.

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{diagnosis}} of silicosis {{is based on}} the history of exposure to silica dust associated with the radiological alterations compatible with the disease. With the main objective of comparing the alterations found in the chest radiography to those of high resolution computed tomography 49 patients with silicosis were selected. These imaging methods were evaluated separately by three readers and the results summarized through the median of the readings. The following alterations were analysed: nodules, coalescences, large opacities, lynfadenopathy. The patients were male, at an average age of 47. 1 years, the majority being <b>sandblasters,</b> with an average exposure time to dust of 15. 3 years. When the chest radiography was compared to high resolution computed tomography the following alterations were observed: i) the high resolution computed tomography showed greater profusion of nodules in 19 cases; ii) the high resolution computed tomography detected isolated coalescence and large opacities in 28 cases, seven of them who were classified initially as having simple silicosis were later changed to the complicated form; iii) the high resolution computed tomography was superior in the evaluation of lynfadenopathy in 16 cases. So, from the 49 analysed patients the high resolution computed tomography was more sensitive than the chest radiography in the evaluation of the alterations studied in 38 (77, 5 %) cases. Other alterations such as cavities, pleural thickening and emphysema were also observed only by this method in 5 cases. In the last 6 (12, 2 %) cases the high resolution computed tomography did not add any data when compared to chest radiography, four of these showed the initial form of the disease.
