This Dutch approach offers fruitful insights into how <b>say</b> <b>on</b> pay works in practice. In {{the light of the}} recent European proposal to introduce a uniform <b>say</b> <b>on</b> pay, we examine the merits of the Dutch system. First, we describe the legal framework of the Dutch <b>say</b> <b>on</b> pay and its background. Then, using hand-collected voting data, information from the minutes of general meetings and ownership data for the entire Dutch <b>say</b> <b>on</b> pay period (2004 – 2014), we address and discuss both its direct and its indirect effects. Our study shows that, although remuneration proposals are seldom rejected, the influence of shareholders on the remuneration policy of the company is considerable. Furthermore, the Dutch approach to <b>say</b> <b>on</b> pay stimulates shareholders’ dialogue and increases pressure on boards regarding remuneration matters, even in the presence of large insider shareholders...|$|R

We apply a regression discontinuity design to <b>Say</b> <b>on</b> Pay shareholder proposals to deal with prior expectations and the endogeneity of internal governance rules. Adopting <b>Say</b> <b>on</b> Pay leads to large increases in market value (5. 4 percent), firm profitability, and long-term performance. In contrast, we find small effects on the level and structure of pay. This suggests that <b>Say</b> <b>on</b> Pay operates as a regular confidence vote, increasing efficiency, and market value...|$|R

I thought it was really overreaching and so bizarre. So I couldn’t make up my mind about it all. Some of it I found intriguing, some I was a little doubtful about." [...] When the producers confirmed {{that they were going to}} film Harris' novel, Hopkins told them yes, but added: [...] "It needs some condensing." [...] The Hollywood Reporter would confirm that Hopkins had agreed to reprise his role in late December 1999, saying he had approved the latest [...] of the script by Steven Zaillian. Hopkins said he had no difficulty moving back into [...] "Lecter's mind". [...] "I just learned the lines and showed up and walked around as Hannibal Lecter. I thought, 'Do I repeat that same performance, or do I vary it?' Ten years had passed so I changed a bit." [...] In the book, Lecter uses bandages to disguise himself as a plastic surgery patient. This was left out of the film because Scott and Hopkins agreed to leave the face alone. Hopkins explains why: [...] "It's as if he's making a statement—'catch me if you can'. With his big hat, he's so obvious that nobody thinks he's Hannibal Lecter. I've always thought he's a very elegant man, a Renaissance man." [...] In the film, Lecter is first seen in Florence [...] "as the classical Lecter, lecturing and being smooth", according to Hopkins.

500|$|Entertainment Weekly Chris Willman {{awarded the}} show an A- rating, and commended Knowles' ability {{to sing and}} dance simultaneously.

[...] J. Freedom du Lac of The Washington Post praised the concert's fast pace and called it a [...] "pure pop spectacle" [...] further describing it as [...] "brilliant... fiery". He noted that the opening, was with a [...] "dramatic, over-the-top entrance about which every aspiring diva dreams", but however he was disappointed in the show's ending. He further wrote, [...] "Though Beyoncé owned the spotlight, this being her 'Experience' and all, her band co-starred in the show, playing hard and tight behind the singer and vamping expertly for sustained periods whenever Beyoncé left the stage to change." [...] The Daily Mail John Aizleman {{was impressed with the}} high energy Knowles showed during the performance, and lauded the dance choreography, particularly that of [...] "Bills, Bills, Bills". However, Aizleman criticized the appearance of a dancer dressed as an angel at the end of [...] "Flaws and All" [...] as being awkward, and wrote that that moment was reminiscent of a [...] "misguided school nativity play". He further added, [...] "Big, brave and bold, the Beyoncé Experience is how pop music would work if it were choreographed by Busby Berkeley... If anyone had the temerity to doubt Beyoncé's star quality and her place in the diva pantheon, they would doubt no more after last night." [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe wrote in her review that the tour title reminded her of a concert theme park rid and added [...] " [...] was an elaborate affair. It was part Vegas review, part hard-edged rock concert, part sweaty funk and soul revival, part diva concert hall performance, and almost all fun to watch as the singer threw herself into the various settings and costumes". Eamon Sweeney from the Irish Independent described Knowles' performance as [...] "the best pop show on the planet" [...] adding that the title of the tour [...] "does exactly what it <b>says</b> <b>on</b> the tin". David Schmeichel of Jam! wrote that the [...] "Splashy Beyonce 'experience' gives a lesson in diva-hood for pop princesses everywhere", further praising her [...] "goddess" [...] like entrance, vocals and performance which he desrcibed as [...] "tightly scripted as her film forays". Ashante Infantry of the Toronto Star noted that the concerts served as a testament to Knowles' talent and power and compared her with [...] Prince for the versatility and musicianship and Tina Turner for the sass and sheer power. Herald Sun Cameron Adams also compared Knowles' performing ability to that of Prince, and stated, [...] "Beyoncé is an old-fashioned, all- round entertainer." [...] Jim Harrington writing for San Jose Mercury News graded the tour as an A-plus affair. A writer of The StarPhoenix praised the show, writing that Knowles [...] "set the stage on fire" [...] for two hours. The writer also added that she had [...] "an honest, God-given talent she's not afraid to share. Her songs, ranging from sultry to soulful were performed with all her heart... With a clear passion for showmanship and a voice not easily matched, Beyonce simply bypassed the mediocrity of most concerts and took her performance to another level." [...] Arielle Castillo of Miami New Times heavily praised Knowles' performance, writing that [...] "B performed like her life depended on it; fresh to death choreography, flawless vocals, crazysexy wardrobe and her trademark lioness mane all in A+ form... Beyonce gave the crowd all that they expected, and multiplied that by 1000."

40|$|The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 {{mandated}} {{a number}} of regulatory reforms including a requirement that large U. S. public companies provide their shareholders {{with the opportunity to}} cast a non-binding vote on executive compensation. The “say on pay” vote was designed to rein in excessive levels of executive compensation and to encourage boards to adopt compensation structures that tie executive pay more closely to performance. Although the literature is mixed, many studies question whether the statute has had the desired effect. Shareholders at most companies overwhelmingly approve the compensation packages, and pay levels continue to be high. Although a lack of shareholder support for executive compensation is relatively rare, <b>say</b> <b>on</b> pay votes at {{a number of}} companies have reflected low levels of shareholder support. A critical question is what factors drive a low <b>say</b> <b>on</b> pay vote. In other words, is <b>say</b> <b>on</b> pay only about pay? In this article, we examine that question by looking at the effect of three factors on voting outcomes [...] pay level, sensitivity of pay to performance, and economic performance. Our key finding is the importance of economic performance to <b>say</b> <b>on</b> pay outcomes. Although pay-related variables affect the shareholder vote, even after we control for those variables, an issuer’s economic performance has a substantial effect and, perhaps most significantly, shareholders do not appear to care about executive compensation unless an issuer is performing badly. In other words, the <b>say</b> <b>on</b> pay vote is, to a large extent, <b>say</b> <b>on</b> performance. This finding has important implications. First, it raises questions about the federally-mandated shareholder voting right as a tool for concerns about executive compensation. <b>Say</b> <b>on</b> pay has limited effectiveness if it is only being used to discipline managers who are underperforming or alternatively is not a vote on outsize or inordinate pay as it was intended to be. Second, and more important, {{to the extent that the}} shareholder vote influences board behavior, granting shareholders another forum for signaling their dissatisfaction with a firm’s economic performance may be counterproductive. If investors are signaling concerns over near-term stock performance through their <b>say</b> <b>on</b> pay votes, they may be increasing director incentives to focus on short-term stock performance rather than firm value...|$|R
