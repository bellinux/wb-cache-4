40|$|The WTO {{negotiations}} {{dragged on}} for over seven years because of the divergent interests of the WTO members. Even among the developed countries, the United States (US) has different interests compared to the European Union (EU). The US is aggressively demanding for significant reduction in tariffs. Compared to the US, the EU is unable to lower its tariffs drastically because further tariff reductions will erode border protection for some of its important agricultural products. In this study, EU agricultural products are examined by tariff lines at eight digit level to reveal the <b>sensitive</b> agricultural <b>products</b> in the EU. These products are butter, skim milk powder, beef meat, poultry meat, pig meat, white sugar, wheat, barley, and maize. A spreadsheet model is used as an analysis tool to complement the various modelling approaches in identifying the <b>sensitive</b> agricultural <b>products</b> of the EU. The spreadsheet projection model is a simple forecasting model that uses a set of projection values from other models to predict possible outcomes. The sensitivity of EU agricultural products is analysed with various exchange rates (USD 0. 90 per Euro to USD 1. 50 per Euro), different tariff reduction formulas (according to the EU proposal, WTO draft proposal, and US proposal), and the scale limits in the Draft formula and US formula. Out of the many proposals submitted to the WTO for the tariff reduction formula, the US proposal is the most extreme and the EU proposal is the most lenient with the G- 20 proposal and the WTO draft proposal being in the middle. It is natural that the EU proposal will generate a lower number of <b>sensitive</b> <b>products</b> compared to the WTO draft proposal, and the US proposal will generate {{the highest number of}} <b>sensitive</b> <b>products.</b> The results demonstrate that cereals such as wheat, barley, and maize are the most resilient to the erosion of border protection due to further reduction in tariffs in the projected Doha Round. In contrast, poultry meat has the weakest border protection in the projected Doha Round. The examined EU agricultural <b>products</b> are very <b>sensitive</b> to the fluctuations of exchange rate. In the projected Doha Round, there are no <b>sensitive</b> agricultural <b>products</b> in the EU if the Euro is very weak - USD 0. 90 per Euro. On the contrary, a very strong Euro (USD 1. 50 per Euro) will create the highest amount of <b>sensitive</b> <b>products</b> in the projected Doha Round. WTO members are entitled to select and designate an appropriate number of <b>sensitive</b> <b>products.</b> Proposals have extended from as little as one percent to as much as fifteen percent of tariff lines. The EU has proposed eight percent of the tariff lines to be designated as <b>sensitive</b> <b>products</b> in contrast to the proposal for only one percent by the US and G- 20 group. The WTO draft proposal estimated that the number of <b>sensitive</b> <b>products</b> may be between four to eight percent of all agricultural tariff lines. Thus, the EU may be eligible to designate between 88 to 176 tariff lines as <b>sensitive</b> <b>products.</b> This study has analysed only nine tariff lines out of the 2200 tariff lines for EU agricultural products. The examined EU agricultural products may represent other tariff lines in the same product category, but potential <b>sensitive</b> <b>products</b> at eight digit level have to be analysed individually in order to choose the correct and exact number of <b>sensitive</b> <b>products</b> for the EU. vo...|$|R

40|$|The {{entry price}} {{regime in the}} European Union (EU) applies to several products, mainly fresh fruits and vegetables. The {{complexity}} of the system with endogenous applied tariffs makes the evaluation of different alternatives of tariff cuts more challenging than for other regimes.

Uncertainty about international prices plays a central role on the estimated impacts on market access of different options.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how EU trade flows and production values {{are affected by}} introducing special treatment for developed countries’ sensitive products into a potential DDA agreement. In particular, it explores how the EU’s decisions regarding {{the size of the}} tariff cut (1 / 3, ½ or 2 / 3 of the cut according to the tiered formula of the Revised Draft Modalities (WTO, 2008 a)) and the corresponding size of TRQ expansion affect its levels of protection for individual products, as well as its own GDP and that of other countries and regions. It is assumed that the EU’s management of its <b>sensitive</b> <b>product</b> regime is motivated by the objective of maintaining farm incomes and production values, rather than that of minimising import access per se. A novelty of the paper is that it explores the extent to which optimal decisions by the EU depend on similar decisions taken by other developed countries, and aims to identify dominant strategies that are independent of other countries’ choice of market access parameters for their sensitive products. The simulation tool used to analyse thirteen scenarios, with a time horizon of 2020, is the global Computable General Equilibrium model GLOBE. The model incorporates various important developments in CGE trade modelling from the last 15 years (e. g. inclusion of preferential agreements, bilateral and multilateral TRQ, split of quota rents, flexible closure rules, etc.), and is calibrated with data from the Global Trade Analysis Project’s (GTAP) database version 7. 1. Our results indicate that the chosen combination of tariff cut and TRQ expansion for sensitive products matters, and the lowest tariff cuts for sensitive products may not necessary lead to the smallest decrease in agricultural production. Moreover, the interdependencies between the <b>sensitive</b> <b>product</b> choices of developed countries are considerable. Insofar as the decisions of other developed countries affect EU exports for both sensitive and non-sensitive products, the net impact of the <b>sensitive</b> <b>product</b> regime on EU farm production and income depends partly on decisions beyond the control of EU decision makers. The extent to which EU management decisions relating to sensitive products matter for the impact of a DDA agreement on third countries’ GDP is also examined. JRC.

40|$|Within WTO {{agricultural}} negotiations, {{this paper}} deals with alternative {{criteria for the}} selection of <b>sensitive</b> <b>products.</b> Existing methodologies mostly rely on the analysis of tariffs and trade flows. On the contrary, assessments of the economic impacts on specific groups of stakeholders, namely the domestic agricultural sector, are missing or conducted {{at a high level}} of product aggregation. We hence develop a methodology that considers the effects of the selection of <b>sensitive</b> <b>products</b> on domestic agricultural prices. Our model, TRIMAG (Tariff Reduction Impact Model for Agriculture), defined at the 8 -digit level, optimizes the domestic agricultural value added subject to a maximum number of sensitive tariff lines. The existing methodologies are applied to the Swiss tariff schedule and results compared with those of TRIMAG. Findings confirm the importance of developing sound economic criteria for the exante impact assessment of policy flexibilities. Furthermore, TRIMAG can be considered as a tariff aggregation tool that can be linked to agricultural simulation models that operate at a higher level of aggregation.

Self compacting concrete {{has been used in}} Sweden for over 10 years, still it only stands for 5 % of the cast in placed concrete in the country. This report deals with, why self compacting concrete isn’t used more often when casting in place within civil engineering. The result is that self compacting concrete with “anläggningscement” (Swedish low heat Portland cement) is a <b>sensitive</b> <b>product</b> because many factors needs to be correct to reach a good result. A reason fore this sensitivity is that the recipe of the concrete has a low tolerance for variations in the different components. Small variations can lead to changes in the consistency which means that the concrete is destroyed and this will result in delay of the delivery to the site. When casting self compacting concrete it’s dependent that the flow of fresh concrete comes continuously, otherwise the concrete can start to cure. The problem that self compacting concrete is a <b>sensitive</b> <b>product</b> needs to be resolved to ensure that this concrete can help casting in place to be industrialized within civil engineering...|$|E
40|$|The {{first round}} of {{negotiations}} held in Ottawa on the 19 th October, 2009, heralded the opening of bilateral trade talks intent on reaching a Canadian-European Union (EU 27) free trade area (FTA) agreement. A second round of negotiations were staged in Brussels in January, whilst further rounds are scheduled for 2010, with the longer term aim of ratifying an agreement within 24 - 30 months. Although stumbling blocs will be encountered, the divergent political interests of each region are compatible. In Canada, a FTA with its second largest trading partner offers {{a viable alternative to}} its current overdependence on the US. Similarly, the EU 27 sees an opportunity to regain a competitive foothold in the North American market. This paper re-examines the long run trade led gains from a Canada-EU 27 FTA.

This issue is difficult to analyze with the commonly used applied trade models, because they represent trade flows at an aggregate level, while <b>sensitive</b> <b>products</b> are picked at the product level and their protection, under the form of tariff-rate quotas, is contingent {{on the level of}} imports. This paper assesses the effect of these exceptions, based on the case of agricultural trade protection in Europe and Japan, two countries where tariff dismantling in the agricultural sector is a particularly sensitive issue. Since agricultural border protection is heterogeneous, we avoid aggregation bias by extending a multi-country computable general equilibrium model to the product level. This allows us to represent trade policies explicitly and to account for their interdependencies. The results suggest that consideration of <b>sensitive</b> <b>products</b> strongly limits the potential gains from a possible agriculture agreement at Doha.
