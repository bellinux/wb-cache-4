North Korean officers from the division continued to attack the ROK unit hoping it would collapse, and the North Korean troops were able to slowly erode at the South Korean division′s defenses, forcing it into a <b>smaller</b> <b>and</b> <b>smaller</b> pocket. The ROK division was forced further south {{to the village of}} Changsa-dong, where U.S. Navy planners began preparations to evacuate the division by LSTs and DUKWs.|$|E
5|$|Because planetesimals are so numerous, {{and spread}} {{throughout}} the protoplanetary disk, some survive {{the formation of a}} planetary system. Asteroids are understood to be left-over planetesimals, gradually grinding each other down into <b>smaller</b> <b>and</b> <b>smaller</b> bits, while comets are typically planetesimals from the farther reaches of a planetary system. Meteorites are samples of planetesimals that reach a planetary surface, and provide {{a great deal of information}} about the formation of the Solar System. Primitive-type meteorites are chunks of shattered low-mass planetesimals, where no thermal differentiation took place, while processed-type meteorites are chunks from shattered massive planetesimals.|$|E

40|$|Best {{practices}} have previously {{been developed for}} beef slaughter and further processing operations with input from academic and industry leaders. Best practices for pork processors have not been developed, and those developed for the beef industry {{may not always be}} applicable to the operations of <b>Small</b> <b>and</b> Very <b>Small</b> establishments. <b>Small</b> <b>and</b> Very <b>Small</b> establishments warrant unique consideration in terms of financial and technological capabilities. While larger processors utilize multiple capital-intensive microbial interventions, smaller establishments often must rely on sanitary practices and more traditional interventions. In order to develop best practices for <b>Small</b> <b>and</b> Very <b>Small</b> pork slaughter <b>and</b> further processing establishments, a survey instrument seeking information on establishment and facility characteristics as well as current sanitary practices was distributed to <b>Small</b> <b>and</b> Very <b>Small</b> establishments in the Southwest region. Additionally, microbiological baselines were established for six <b>Small</b> <b>and</b> Very <b>Small</b> pork slaughter and/or further processing establishments to allow the efficacy of best practices to be assessed following implementation in each of the six plants. Survey responses revealed areas where best practice recommendation efforts may be focused, and microbiological baseline data provided insight to the condition of carcasses and environmental surfaces using current sanitary practices. Combined, the data reveal the opportunities for improvement in the food safety systems of <b>Small</b> <b>and</b> Very <b>Small</b> pork processing establishments...|$|R
5|$|By that time, {{the land}} once held in common by the Székely {{community}} had gradually become divided into <b>smaller</b> <b>and</b> <b>smaller</b> units; thus {{a vast number}} of the free warrior-peasants had to enter the service of their more prosperous fellow Székelys. This social stratification was formally recognized by a royal decree in 1473. Thereafter those who performed mounted military service were differentiated from those who fought as foot-soldiers; those who were unable to finance themselves even as foot-soldiers were legally reduced to servitude.|$|E
5|$|During phylogenesis, {{cerebrospinal}} fluid is present within the neuraxis before it circulates. The CSF of Teleostei fish are {{contained within the}} ventricles of the brains, {{but not in a}} nonexistent subarachnoid space. In mammals, where a subarachnoid space is present, the CSF is present in it. Absorption of CSF is seen in amniotes and more complex species, and as species become progressively more complex, the system of absorption becomes progressively more enhanced, and the role of spinal epidural veins in absorption plays a progressively <b>smaller</b> <b>and</b> <b>smaller</b> role.|$|E
5|$|In mathematics, {{a finite}} {{subdivision}} rule is a recursive way of dividing a polygon or other two-dimensional shape into <b>smaller</b> <b>and</b> <b>smaller</b> pieces. Subdivision rules {{in a sense}} are generalizations of fractals. Instead of repeating exactly the same design over and over, they have slight variations in each stage, allowing a richer structure while maintaining the elegant style of fractals. Subdivision rules {{have been used in}} architecture, biology, and computer science, {{as well as in the}} study of hyperbolic manifolds. Substitution tilings are a well-studied type of subdivision rule.|$|E

5|$|As the mesocyclone lowers {{below the}} cloud base, {{it begins to}} take in cool, moist air from the {{downdraft}} region of the storm. The convergence of warm air in the updraft and cool air causes a rotating wall cloud to form. The RFD also focuses the mesocyclone's base, causing it to draw air from a <b>smaller</b> <b>and</b> <b>smaller</b> area on the ground. As the updraft intensifies, it creates an {{area of low pressure}} at the surface. This pulls the focused mesocyclone down, {{in the form of a}} visible condensation funnel. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, fanning outward and creating a gust front that can cause severe damage a considerable distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within a few minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.|$|E
5|$|The lower {{respiratory}} tract {{is part of the}} respiratory system, and consists of the trachea and the structures below this including the lungs. The trachea receives air from the pharynx and travels down to a place where it splits (the carina) into a right and left bronchus. These supply air to the right and left lungs, splitting progressively into the secondary and tertiary bronchi for the lobes of the lungs, and into <b>smaller</b> <b>and</b> <b>smaller</b> bronchioles until they become the respiratory bronchioles. These in turn supply air through alveolar ducts into the alveoli, where the exchange of gases take place. Oxygen breathed in, diffuses through the walls of the alveoli into the enveloping capillaries and into the circulation, and carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the lungs to be breathed out.|$|E
5|$|The {{tour for}} Night in the Ruts {{commenced}} shortly thereafter but the band found themselves playing in <b>smaller</b> <b>and</b> <b>smaller</b> venues {{than they were}} before due to their popularity beginning to wane. Steven Tyler's drug issues were starting to affect his performance and songwriting, and he reached bottom when he collapsed on stage during a show in Portland, Maine in 1980 and did not get up {{for the remainder of the}} set. Also in 1980, Aerosmith released its Greatest Hits album. While the compilation didn't chart very high initially, it gained popularity later and has gone on to become the band's bestselling album in the United States, with sales of 11 million copies. In the fall of 1980, Tyler was injured in a serious motorcycle accident, which left him hospitalized for two months, and unable to tour or record well into 1981.|$|E
