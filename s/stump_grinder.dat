50|$|<b>Stump</b> <b>grinders</b> can be {{the size}} of a lawn mower or as large as truck. Most {{accomplish}} their task by means of a high-speed disk with teeth that grind the stump and roots into small chips.|$|R
50|$|Erskine {{continues}} {{as the home}} of Erskine Attachments, formerly known as Erskine Manufacturing Company, established in 1948. The company began as a manufacturer of heavy equipment snowblowers and grain hitch elevators before changing its name to Erskine Attachments when it began manufacturing a line of Skid Steer Attachments for the Ingersoll Rand Bobcat company. Now private, Erskine Attachments manufactures more than 40 skid steer attachments including brush mowers, snowblowers, blades, buckets, grapples, post drivers, <b>stump</b> <b>grinders,</b> tree shears, and others that fit all skid steers and some front end loaders that utilize the skid steer style quick attach mechanism. Erskine Attachments was used as a pilot for the Minnesota JOBZ incentive program to revitalize Minnesota's manufacturing opportunities and has been referenced for its continuance as a viable success story.|$|R
50|$|Tree stumps can be {{difficult}} to remove from the ground. They can be dug out, shredded with a <b>stump</b> <b>grinder</b> or burnt.|$|E

50|$|A <b>stump</b> <b>grinder</b> or {{stump cutter}} {{is a power}} tool or {{equipment}} attachment that removes tree stumps {{by means of a}} rotating cutting disc that chips away the wood.|$|E
50|$|A typical <b>stump</b> <b>grinder</b> {{incorporates}} a cutter wheel with fixed carbide teeth. The cutter wheel movements {{are controlled by}} hydraulic cylinders to push the cutter head laterally through the stump and to raise and lower it.|$|E
50|$|The {{conventional}} {{bucket of}} many skid loaders {{can be replaced}} {{with a variety of}} specialized buckets or attachments, many powered by the loader's hydraulic system. These include backhoe, hydraulic breaker, pallet forks, angle broom, sweeper, auger, mower, snow blower, <b>stump</b> <b>grinder,</b> tree spade, trencher, dumping hopper, ripper, tillers, grapple, tilt, roller, snow blade, wheel saw, cement mixer, and wood chipper machine.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} {{other types of}} stump {{grinders}} that are applied to tractors, excavators and other construction equipment. These machines can completely remove {{the roots of the}} trees in a few seconds or recover {{the central part of the}} roots. Vertical stump grinders are usually used in forests, for plant biomass, for the forestry sector, and for the maintenance of green areas, etc. They can destroy an entire root of 50 cm in diameter to more than one meter deep in 30 seconds. Studies have shown that the normal <b>stump</b> <b>grinder</b> (with disc and teeth) can eliminate most of the first 20 - 25 cm of stumps, but for stumps with a bigger diameter the problem is not solved as the plant can start growing back. Instead, a vertical <b>stump</b> <b>grinder</b> can completely destroy tree stumps of up to 150 cm in diameter permanently. They can be applied on tractors (the mechanical versions) and on the excavators and others earth moving machinery (the hydraulic versions).|$|E
5000|$|Backhoe loaders {{are very}} common {{and can be}} used {{for a wide variety of}} tasks: construction, small demolitions, light {{transportation}} of building materials, powering building equipment, digging holes/excavation, landscaping, breaking asphalt, and paving roads. Often, the backhoe bucket can also be replaced with powered attachments such as a breaker, grapple, auger, or a <b>stump</b> <b>grinder.</b> Enhanced articulation of attachments can be achieved with intermediate attachments such as the tiltrotator. Many backhoes feature quick coupler (quick-attach) mounting systems and auxiliary hydraulic circuits for simplified attachment mounting, increasing the machine's utilization on the job site. Some loader buckets have a retractable bottom or [...] "clamshell", enabling it to empty its load more quickly and efficiently. Retractable-bottom loader buckets are also often used for grading and scraping. The front assembly may be a removable attachment or permanently mounted.|$|E
50|$|For {{production}} agriculture, {{past and}} present, two-wheel tractors accept {{a wide range}} of implements, such as the following: For soil-working: rototillers, moldboard plows, disc-plows, rotary plows, root/tuber harvesting plows, small subsoiler plows, powered and non-powered harrows, seeders, transplanters, and planters. Even zero till/no-till planters and seeders have become available. In plant protection and weed control, two-wheel tractor implements consist of various inter-cultivators and sprayers. For harvesting, available implements are: Forage: Sickle bar mowers, disk mowers, hayrakes, hay tedders, haybalers and bale wrappers silage production. For grain harvest: reaper/grain harvesters, reaper-binders, and even combine harvesters are available typically only for Asian two-wheel tractors. For transport, trailers with capacities from 0.5 to 5 plus ton cargoes are available. General mowing implements consist of lawn mowers, brush mowers, and flail mowers. For snow removal, implements consist of snowblowers, power sweepers, and snow/dozer blades. Other implements include: chipper/shredders, log splitters, electrical generator, pressure washer, crimper-roller, fertilizer/salt/lime spreader, and <b>stump</b> <b>grinder.</b> This list of implements (which may not be complete) means that two-wheel tractors can execute practically all of the chores done by larger 4-wheel tractors, with the exception of items like front-loaders, which obviously have the physical stability requirements of a 4-wheel (two-axle) tractor.|$|E
40|$|Giant reed (Arundo donax L.) is a {{perennial}} rhizomatous grass {{that is currently}} indicated as an alternative crop for bioenergy production. Cultivation of giant reed for energy purposes requires the identification of an appropriate propagation technique, usually carried out with stem cuttings and rhizomes. Both methods are very efficient, but also very expensive as they require demanding and labor-intensive manual work. This study aimed at verifying the viability of a mechanical method for in situ rhizome extraction, using a modified <b>stump</b> <b>grinder.</b> Three different machine settings were tested {{with the goal of}} obtaining rhizomes with variable length, ranging between 4. 4 and 6. 4 cm. Survival rate and shoot production were used to determine the vitality of rhizomes with different lengths. The study confirmed the viability of mechanical rhizome production in giant reed nurseries...|$|E
