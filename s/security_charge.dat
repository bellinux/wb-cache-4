This architecture supports the efficient delivery of services, unicast and multicast, legacy and multimedia, to users {{connected to the}} ad-hoc network. For this purpose, several functionalities {{need to be in}} place. First, efficient routing and mobility mechanisms are proposed to enable mobility of users inside and between ad-hoc networks with decreased overhead. Second, distributed QoS mechanisms need to be developed to support service differentiation and resources control responsive to nodes mobility. Finally, <b>security,</b> <b>charging</b> and rewarding mechanisms are proposed to guarantee that only authorized users access the requested services, to increase the operators interest, and to ensure the correct behaviour of the users in the ad-hoc network...|$|R
