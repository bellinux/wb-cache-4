5000|$|The video {{bandwidth}} filter or VBW filter is the {{low-pass filter}} directly after the envelope detector. It's the bandwidth {{of the signal}} chain after the detector. Averaging or peak detection then refers to how the digital storage portion of the device records samples—it takes several samples per time step and stores only one sample, either {{the average of the}} samples or the highest one. [...] The video bandwidth determines the capability to discriminate between two different power levels. [...] This is because a narrower VBW will remove noise in the detector output. This filter is used to “smooth” the display by removing noise from the envelope. Similar to the RBW, the VBW affects the <b>sweep</b> <b>time</b> of the display if the VBW is less than the RBW.

5000|$|... "30-Second Shootout"At the {{beginning}} of the second segment of the question round, both contestants on a team played an individual game, which banked the team 30 seconds of <b>Sweep</b> <b>time.</b> Each team took turns by playing the game individually. The format usually consisted of a contestant guessing a series of words (usually five to seven letters) using the clues given by his or her partner (similar to Pyramid and Password). The first letter of each correct answer was a letter {{in the name of a}} brand name or item from the market, which the guesser then had to determine to earn the <b>Sweep</b> <b>time.</b> Each of the teams had 30 seconds to achieve this (40 in the final Lifetime season), and if a word was accidentally blurted out by the clue-giver, the team was disqualified automatically. An original rule was that once a clue was used on one of the words in the list, it was not to be used again (doing so also lead to disqualification of that team), however this rule was later scrapped. On some episodes, an alternative format was used with a picture of a product shown. Each clue changed the product's picture.|$|E

As demonstrated by the animation to the right, the smaller the bandwidth, the more spectral resolution.

As of 2002, one major company owns and offers models in both competing designs, with engineering cross-pollination of techniques between the product design teams. As of 2005, it increasingly appears that the spiral CT designs, especially those with (b) 64 detector rows, (b) 3×360°/sec rotation speeds and designed for cardiac imaging, are largely replacing the EBT design from a commercial and medical perspective. However, EBT still offers sweep speeds of effectively 50×360°/sec rotation speeds and lower radiation exposure. The latest version of the EBT eSpeed offers a 33 ms <b>sweep</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

Switching time exhibits a minimum at a particular optimal <b>sweep</b> <b>time.</b> This unusual behavior is explained by the admixture of a ballistic (precessional) rotation of the moment caused by the perpendicular bias field in the presence of a variable switching field.

40|$|We {{consider}} a switching {{of the magnetic}} moment with an easy axis anisotropy from an "up" to a "down" direction {{under the influence of}} an external magnetic field. The driving field is applied parallel to the easy axis and is continuously swept from a positive to a negative value. In addition, a small constant perpendicular bias field is present. It is shown that while the driving field switches the moment in a conventional way, the perpendicular field creates an admixture of the precessional (ballistic) switching that speeds up the switching process. Precessional contribution produces a non-monotonic dependence of the switching time on the field <b>sweep</b> <b>time</b> with a minimum at a particular <b>sweep</b> <b>time</b> value.

30|$|The {{obtained}} FFT shot {{cannot be}} displayed directly {{because the number}} of FFT bins is generally greater than the available pixels on the screen.

In the spectrogram mode, the number of combined FFT shots is defined by the parameter <b>sweep</b> <b>time.</b> To a certain extent, users can lower the <b>sweep</b> <b>time</b> to increase the time resolution.

A new formulation of distributed sweep coverage is proposed to cooperatively complete the workload in the uncertain region.

The trajectories of partition points of agents form the boundaries between adjacent sub-regions. Moreover, it is proved that multi-agent system with the proposed control algorithm is input-to-state stable.
