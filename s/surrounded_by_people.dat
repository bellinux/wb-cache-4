Towards {{the end of the}} chorus, Brown and his dancers appear back inside the main room and continue dancing. At one point, the video is slowed down as Brown and his dancers do flips. In other scenes, he is seen dancing alone with a cane in a rain-filled room, wearing white dress pants, a black tank top and a fedora. Brown then splits into three people, comes back together, takes off his shirt and throws it at the camera, causing its lens to crack.|$|E
5|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by Nigel Dick and was filmed from 4 to 6 October 1999 at the Mission Tiki drive-in theatre in Montclair, California. In the video, Raven sings the song while {{she is in a}} car with a boy, while Larsen sings and plays the guitar in front of another car. This footage is mixed with M2M singing together at the drive-in, people dancing, the projectionist struggling with his malfunctioning equipment, and the concession stand worker who has an overflowing popcorn maker. When the popcorn stand explodes, M2M continue to perform <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>people</b> as popcorn rains down. Air cannons were used to fire 200 garbage bin-sized bags of popcorn into the air to create the raining popcorn effect. In the US the music video made its premiere on 24 October on The WB following that night's screening of 7th Heaven. It began airing on The Box and MuchMusic in early November 1999 and began airing on MTV on 15 November.|$|E
25|$|Herd {{immunity}} also decreases risk {{to people}} who have a compromised immune system. Some people who have a compromised immune system cannot get certain vaccines and thus are at increased risk if those around them are not vaccinated for those diseases. If the immunocompromised person is <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>people</b> who have not been vaccinated and have the disease, that person will likely contract the disease. The outcome for people with compromised immune systems who subsequently get infected is often worse than that of the general population. Herd immunity decreases this risk.|$|E

500|$|Tuberculosis was {{for centuries}} {{associated}} with poetic and artistic qualities among those infected, {{and was also}} known as [...] "the romantic disease". Major artistic figures such as the poets John Keats, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Edgar Allan Poe, the composer Frederic Chopin, the novelists Charlotte Brontë, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Thomas Mann, W.

A widespread belief was that tuberculosis assisted artistic talent. Physical mechanisms proposed for this effect included the slight fever and toxaemia that it caused, allegedly helping them to see life more clearly and to act decisively.|$|E

He stole the last dart holding the concoction that killed his demon twin, but ultimately gave it back to Gemma and told her either she could kill him, and live her life without him in but consumed with guilt for killing him, or she could let him disappear from her life forever, without any guilt for murdering him. Gemma shot the dart at him, but John disappeared. The final panel of Hellblazer reveals John, looking shocked and much older than we'd previously seen him, standing in a bar appropriately called [...] "A Long Journey's End" [...] <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>people,</b> {{in front of a}} shelf full of bottles with the names of the comic's staff over the years.|$|E

He and his brother were <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>people</b> who worked in the arts, regularly attended theater performances with their mother, and were encouraged to make their own home movies. The brothers auditioned for roles in local commercials and film productions because of their mother's friendship with a Cambridge-area casting director, and Affleck first acted professionally at the age of seven. His mother saved his wages in a college trust fund, and hoped her son would ultimately become a teacher, worrying that acting was an insecure and [...] "frivolous" [...] profession. David Wheeler, a family friend, was Affleck's acting coach and later described him as a [...] "very bright and intensely curious" [...] child. When Affleck was 13, he filmed a children's television program in Mexico and learned to speak Spanish during a year spent traveling around the country with his mother and brother.|$|E
500|$|Wałęsa {{has been}} criticized for a confrontational style and for instigating [...] "war at the top", whereby former Solidarity allies clashed with one another, causing annual changes of government. This {{increasingly}} isolated Wałęsa on the political scene. As he lost political allies, he came to be <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>people</b> who were viewed by the public as incompetent and disreputable. Mudslinging during election campaigns tarnished his reputation. Some thought Wałęsa, an ex-electrician with no higher education, was too plain-spoken and too undignified for the post of president. Others thought him too erratic in his views or complained he was too authoritarian and that he sought to strengthen his own power {{at the expense of the}} Sejm. Wałęsa's national security advisor Jacek Merkel credited the shortcomings of Wałęsa's presidency to his inability to comprehend the office of the president as an institution. He was an effective union leader capable of articulating what the workers felt but as president he had difficulty delegating power or navigating bureaucracy. Wałęsa's problems were compounded by the difficult transition to a market economy; in the long run it was seen as highly successful but it lost Wałęsa's government much popular support.|$|E

On February 2, 2012, Brown revealed details about the video via his official Twitter account, tweeting [...] "I'll let you guys judge but this Turn Up the music video hands down is probably my best video by far!!!". Several images from the shoot were leaked online the same day, showing Brown {{in the passenger seat}} of a classic car, and standing shirtless on top of a vehicle with a group of people. Another image showed one of the dancer's face covered with a [...] "wild mask". A behind-the-scenes video clip was posted online on February 14, 2012. The video showed Brown, dressed in a black suit, performing dance routines with several backup dancers in a club, <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>people</b> wearing animal heads. Another scene showed Brown dancing in the rain and in the streets. The music video premiered online on February 17, 2012, and features a cameo appearance by hip hop trio The Rej3ctz.|$|E

500|$|The {{main idea}} behind the video is that of Gaga getting kidnapped {{by a group of}} supermodels who drug her and then sell her off to the Russian mafia for a million rubles. It takes place in a {{fluorescent}} white bathhouse. The video begins with Gaga sitting on a white throne in a brightly-lit white room. The scene shows her wearing the razor-blade glasses and <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>people</b> and a harlequin Great Dane. She has her finger on the mute button of an iPod speaker, and as she releases it, [...] "Bad Romance" [...] begins to play and a dimly-lit bathhouse is shown. A bright light pans across the walls, activating fluorescent lighting, which shines through a sign reading [...] "Bath Haus of GaGa". As the first hook of the song begins, a group of female dancers wearing white long-sleeved leotards with knee-high boots and matching crowns crawl out of white, coffin-like pods. The center pod has [...] "Mons†er" [...] written on it, and Gaga emerges wearing an outfit similar to those worn by the others, who begin to dance behind her. A pastiche of ensuing scenes alternates between Gaga singing to herself {{in front of a mirror}} and lying in a bathtub.|$|E
500|$|Following his mother's {{successful}} {{career as a}} divorce lawyer, {{the family moved to}} Beverly Hills, where Schwimmer attended Beverly Hills High School. Schwimmer admitted to being an outsider during his time at the school, recalling, [...] "When I was there I always felt: 'This is not me, I'm <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>people</b> with a different value system. And I just {{wanted to get out of}} California.'" [...] He was best at the subjects of science and math and thought he would become a doctor. Schwimmer enrolled in a drama class, where he appeared in stage productions. Encouraged by his school drama teacher to further his acting, he flew to Chicago for an acting workshop. He noted that the experience was both [...] "enlightening and exhilarating". In 1984, Schwimmer graduated from Beverly Hills High and wanted to go straight into acting, but his parents insisted he go to college first so he would have something to fall back on. Schwimmer moved to Chicago to attend Northwestern University, where he had attended a summer drama course when he was 16 years old. At the university, he studied theater and was in an improv group with Stephen Colbert, the No-Fun Mud Piranhas. After graduating in 1988, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in theater and speech, Schwimmer co-founded the Lookingglass Theatre Company. Subsequently, he returned to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career.|$|E
500|$|In October 1971, Dyer {{accompanied}} Bacon to Paris for {{the opening}} of the artist's retrospective at the Grand Palais. The show was the high point of Bacon's career to date, and he was now being described as Britain's [...] "greatest living painter". Dyer was now a desperate man, and although he was [...] "allowed" [...] to attend, he was well aware that he was [...] "slipping", in every sense, out of the picture. To draw Bacon's attention he earlier planted cannabis in Bacon's flat, then phoned the police, and he had attempted suicide on a number of occasions. Dyer committed suicide, via an overdose of barbiturates, {{on the eve of the}} Paris exhibition in their shared hotel room. Bacon spent the following day <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>people</b> eager to meet him. In mid-evening he was informed that Dyer had taken an overdose of barbiturates and was dead. Though devastated, Bacon continued with the retrospective and displayed powers of self-control [...] "to which few of us could aspire", according to Russell. Bacon was deeply affected by the loss of Dyer, and he had recently lost four other friends and his nanny. From this point on, death haunted his life and work. Though he gave a stoic appearance at the time, he was inwardly broken. He did not express his feelings to critics, but later admitted to friends that [...] "daemons, disaster and loss" [...] now stalked him as if his own version of the Eumenides. Bacon spent the remainder of his stay in Paris attending to promotional activities and funeral arrangements. He returned to London later that week to comfort Dyer's family. The funeral proved to be an emotional affair for all, and many of Dyer's friends, including hardened East-End criminals, broke down in tears. As the coffin was lowered into the grave one attendant screamed [...] "you bloody fool!". Although Bacon remained stoic throughout, in the following months Dyer preoccupied his imagination as never before. To confront his loss, he painted a number of tributes on small canvasses and his three [...] "Black Triptych" [...] masterpieces.|$|E

2500|$|On the left, Jupiter and Saturn {{are shown}} {{welcoming}} the assassinated King of France, as he ascends as a personified Roman sovereign, victoriously to Olympus. [...] As {{with all of}} Ruben's allegorical paintings, these two figures are chosen for a reason. Jupiter {{is meant to be}} the King's celestial counterpart, while Saturn, who represents finite time, is an indication of the end of Henry's mortal existence. This particular theme, within the painting as a whole, has found other great masters receiving inspiration and fascination from Rubens' tormented figure of Bellona, the goddess of War, who lays disarmed below. [...] Post-Impressionist, Paul Cézanne (1839–1906) registered for permission to copy the goddess as many as ten times. It should be kept in mind that Rubens's energetic manner of placing all these allegorical themes is substantially resultant from classical coins as documented through communication with his friend and notable collector of antiquities, Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc. The right side of the panel shows the succession of the new Queen, dressed in solemn clothing suited to a widow. [...] She is framed by a triumphal arch and <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>people</b> at the court.|$|E
2500|$|Quicksilver was {{originally}} {{presented as a}} mutant capable of moving and thinking at superhuman speeds. Originally capable of running {{at the speed of}} sound, exposure to the High Evolutionary's Isotope E made it possible for the character to run at supersonic speeds of up to Mach 10 and resist the effects of friction, reduced oxygen, and kinetic impact while moving at super-speeds. Also, he has a fast metabolism and can heal more rapidly than the average human. The character's speed allows him to perform such feats as creating cyclone-strength winds and running up walls or across bodies of water. Pietro's mind can perceive information with a photographic memory short term, becoming faster than the speed of thought, because he can shift his thoughts at a speed faster than normal thought. Also, he can cause vibrations in his body to transfer to solid material, and has superior agility and reflexes compared to other mutants. It has been revealed {{that one of the reasons}} for his abrasive and impatient personality is that it seems to him that the rest of the world is moving in slow motion and that he is constantly waiting for it to catch up. As he once explained, [...] "Have you ever had a day where you are at the ATM and you are in a hurry because you're running late but the person in front of you doesn't know how to use the ATM and they're taking forever? Now imagine what it must be like to spend every day <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>people</b> who don't know how to use the ATM." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{number of}} women who attend school in urban areas vs. rural areas differs drastically. [...] In urban areas, women's {{education}} is increasing every day. The parents of girls who live in urban areas are a lot more accepting of their enrolling in school and even encourage girls to pursue a career as they are also a lot more knowledgeable of their rights. This makes them a lot more motivated to stand up for their education. Parent in urban areas are a lot more modernized or westernized. These urban parents acknowledge the importance of an education. Women who live in urban areas are often enrolled in private schools getting a better education there as they have a lot more educational accessibility. Women in urban areas are also <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>people</b> who are educated and are not put down or beaten for going to school. Unlike in urban areas, women in rural areas are discouraged to attend school. Most of them are brought up in conservative families with little to no education. They have to work harder than women in urban areas because they have little support system. If their parents are accepting of education they still cannot go since most of them are very poor and cannot afford the expense. The women also don’t attend school in rural areas of Pakistan because it is not culturally accepted. These conservative families tend to be more traditional expecting women to stay at home and attend the house while men go out to work. They’re also restricted in rural areas because their town may not even have a school, therefore having to travel a long distance to attend one.|$|E
