40|$|The authors aim {{to provide}} a set of tools to {{facilitate}} the main stages of the competitive bidding process for construction contractors. These involve 1) deciding whether to bid, 2) calculating the total price, and 3) breaking down the total price into the items {{of the bill of}} quantities or the <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> to optimise contractor cash flows. To define factors that affect the decision to bid, the authors rely upon literature on the subject and put forward that multi-criteria methods are applied to calculate a single measure of contract attractiveness (utility value). An attractive contract implies that the contractor is likely to offer a lower price to increase chances of winning the competition. The total bid price is thus to be interpolated between the lowest acceptable and the highest justifiable price based on the contract attractiveness. With the total bid price established, {{the next step is to}} split it between the items <b>of</b> the <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments.</b> A linear programming model is proposed for this purpose. The application of the models is illustrated with a numerical example...|$|R

2500|$|Donovan argued Smiley's {{case before}} the justices.

For {{more than a hundred}} years, he noted, OCC had not seen fit to define specifically what kind <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> were considered interest. Yet, coincidentally, only when a case turning on that issue appeared headed to the Supreme Court did it see a need to do so.|$|R

Canadian ARCs usually pay a fee and de-emphasize the selling of work, although this will vary from gallery to gallery.

5000|$|Once traded, swaps {{can also}} be priced using {{rational}} pricing. For example, the Floating leg of an interest rate swap can be [...] "decomposed" [...] {{into a series of}} forward rate agreements. Here, since the swap has identical payments to the FRA, arbitrage free pricing must apply as above - i.e. the value of this leg is equal to the value of the corresponding FRAs. Similarly, the [...] "receive-fixed" [...] leg of a swap can be valued by comparison to a bond with the same <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments.</b> (Relatedly, given that their underlyings have the same cash flows, bond options and swaptions are equatable.)
