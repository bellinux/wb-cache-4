Nonetheless, the notion that saving must be boosted in order to expand investment, is a contention that has to be taken with a 'pinch of salt'. This study by elaborating on the temporal relationship between investment and saving, provides econometric evidence, on the basis of which investment is a variable with the utmost importance.

40|$|The {{problems}} {{experienced by}} the Dutch economy during {{the last seven years}} are discussed, problems for future development of the Dutch economy pinpointed and the political-economic debate in the Netherlands surveyed. Ten rules for <b>sound</b> <b>government</b> <b>finance</b> are formulated, and it is argued that the political reality of budget cuts has led to the crowding-out of government investment. Consequently, government productive assets have not kept up with the explosion of government debt, so the net worth of the public sector has declined since 1982. Dutch monetary policy is geared towards the discipline of not using seigniorage for <b>government</b> <b>finance</b> and pegging the stock of nominal government debt. Consumption smoothing suggests that, given liberalized capital markets, investment should be financed through the current account of the the balance of payments, but little evidence can be found for this. This {{may be due to the}} `structural budget deficit' rule which has been implemented by Jelle Zijlstra.

In many centralized countries, the Ministry of Local Government is tasked with the exclusive responsibility to monitor and coordinate all aspects of intergovernmental relations, including local <b>government</b> <b>finances.</b> While the Ministry of Local Government generally also plays a role in more decentralized countries, {{it is not unusual for}} broad-based or inter-ministerial commissions to be tasked with tracking and considering local <b>government</b> <b>finance</b> issues in more decentralized countries. In contrast, other decentralized countries rely more heavily on local government associations or even the legislative branch to monitor and analyze the system of local <b>government</b> <b>finances</b> and to represent local government interests at the national level to assure a balanced system of intergovernmental relations.
