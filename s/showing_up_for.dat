5|$|The false {{story of}} the {{execution}} of the Ho-Chunk prisoners, along with the incessant American trespassing, convinced some Ho-Chunks to take up arms against the United States. The timing seemed right, since the evacuation of Fort Crawford appeared to be a sign of American weakness. Another grievance was the news that some Ho-Chunk women had been sexually assaulted by American riverboat crews along the Mississippi River, although this story, like the one about the executions, may have been a false rumor. The Ho-Chunks broke off diplomatic relations with the United States by not <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> a scheduled treaty conference, and prepared for war.|$|E
5|$|With {{five months}} devoted to casting for the pilot, Gough and Miller cast {{ultimately}} hired eight actors {{to take on}} the role of series regulars for the first season. Since then, only two characters from the first season have remained regulars through to the eighth season, with seven new actors taking on lead roles from seasons two through eight. Four of those new actors began as recurring guests in their first seasonal appearance, but were given top billing the following season. As the series progresses, recurring guests appear at various times to help move the overall storyline of the show or just provide a side-story arc for one of the main characters, such as Brainiac or Adam Knight. Other recurring guests appear as background characters, <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> only a few scenes, which includes characters like Sheriff Nancy Adams or Dr. Virgil Swann.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} Estudiantes Española or Estudiantina Española was a {{group of}} 64 students formed by 26 February 1878, principally from Madrid colleges. They dressed in historical clothing, representing ancient sophists of Salamanca and Alcala and traveled to Paris for Carnival staying from March 2 through March 15. This early group of students played flutes, guitars violins, bandurrias, flutes and tambourines. This early group was led by Ildefonso de Zabaleta (president) and Joaquin de Castañeda (vice president). The group performed before large audiences in Paris (reports of 10,000 and 56,000 people <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> a night's entertainment were reported).|$|E

Typically, off-duty guards would go out drinking at nearby taverns and hours later, return inebriated, ready {{to take part in}} interrogations. Sometimes, they would begin their own so-called interrogations, unsupervised. Local taverns, normally closed at the hours the guards were ready to drink, were faced with violence and threats if they did not re-open.

The FIS asked Stewart to investigate Coacci's excuse for failing to report for deportation on April 15. On April 16, officers discovered Coacci at home and determined that he had given a false alibi for not <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> deportation. They offered him another week, but Coacci declined and left for Italy on April 18, 1920.|$|E

25|$|Eminescu's {{interest}} in doine only peaked after 1877, {{when he was}} living as a journalist in Bucharest, and began systematic readings from collections of folk poetry. They were integrated into a vast fund of drafts and versions for Doina, which, as noted by Perpessicius, cannot realistically be published together as a critical instrument. In its final form, Doina is popularly associated with the unveiling at Iași in June 1883, of a monument to Prince Stephen. Eminescu was by then erratic and fatigued, displaying, already from May 1883, {{the early stages of}} a mental breakdown. Lodging with Ion Creangă in Iași, he shocked his old friend by brandishing a revolver, explained by the poet as a defense against unspecified enemies. He never actually attended the unveiling of Stephen's statue, only <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> parallel ceremonies at Junimea society. It was there that he first read his Doina, on June 4. The audience was reportedly enthusiastic, and moved in to hug Eminescu. Doina was first published by the Junimist monthly Convorbiri Literare on July 1.|$|E

500|$|Keene's {{career as}} the [...] "Eagle Lady" [...] began {{shortly after her}} arrival in Homer, when one morning she noticed two bald eagles on the beach near her motorhome. Keene saw {{offering}} food to the eagles as {{a natural extension of}} her practice of keeping bird feeders filled with sunflower seeds for wild songbirds. She began to bring home surplus fish in a bucket from her job, and each morning would throw some fish to the eagles over the short driftwood fence she had made around her motorhome. By the end of that spring, a half-dozen eagles were <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> breakfast. The eagles departed with the arrival of summer, when the Spit became more active with human visitors, but they returned in the winter when tourist season had ended, and Keene resumed the daily feeding.|$|E
500|$|Homer's first {{flashback}} shows {{a clip of}} him {{falling down}} Springfield Gorge on a skateboard, a scene taken from the episode [...] "Bart the Daredevil". The Simpsons staff were concerned that this would make people think the episode {{was in fact a}} clip show, so they kept the clip short. The staff also debated how horrific Smithers' father's corpse would look. The first design was [...] "more horrific" [...] than the one seen in the episode, and it more closely resembled Smithers. The corpse seen in the episode was an altered version of the first design. The video recorded by Mr. Burns' security camera was originally supposed to be shot in the same angle as a real security camera, but according to director Steven Dean Moore, to follow the narrative, the staff [...] "had to lose [...] ". This led to some confusion, since one of the shots were from inside the core, making it look as if the security camera was actually inside it. The staff intended to cut the shot, but they later decided to keep it in; Jean explained in the DVD audio commentary for the episode that [...] "Nobody ever notices it". The end of the episode originally had Chad Sexington <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> his date with Marge, causing Homer to scream uncontrollably again; however, it was cut in favor of Hank Azaria's improvisation as Moe, which, according to Simpsons writer Carolyn Omine, was Azaria's [...] "favorite thing [...] had ever done" [...] on The Simpsons.|$|E

2500|$|Criminal defense {{attorney}} Angelyn Gates of Chase Criminal Defense Attorneys raises concern that citizen groups {{are not subject}} to the same standards as trained law enforcement officials. She notes that laws are designed to keep police officers from violating citizens' rights, and that the same rules don't apply to citizens who may be violating other citizens' rights. [...] "Police officers are trained in theory," [...] Gates said. [...] " [...] are not watching out for themselves by trying to pretend they're a child on the Internet," [...] she said. [...] "They're doing it for the thrill, fun, and notoriety they seem to be getting out of it." [...] Detective Mike Burns of Darke County asserts that Perverted-Justice sets stricter criteria than many law enforcement agencies do for arrest. He contends that Perverted-Justice subscribes to protocols well within those followed by law enforcement. He does however concede, [...] "Sometimes it was a fine line, but they provided us with 140 people they were chatting with after 10 days with possibilities of <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> a meeting.

As for herself not <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the 2009 season of Making the Band, Bex said that it was a [...] "personal choice" [...] and was nothing against the fans.

O'Day said she has forgiven being released from the group, and people who blamed her for the group's breakup. When asked if Danity Kane could be a group again, O'Day said yes.
