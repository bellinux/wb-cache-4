5|$|The Australian {{congener}} Sutorius australiensis produces <b>somewhat</b> {{smaller and}} darker fruitbodies than S.eximius. The violet-grey bolete, Tylopilus plumbeoviolaceus, {{is found in}} eastern North America and Korea. This species is <b>somewhat</b> similar in appearance, but can be distinguished by its smoother stipe, less brownish colors, and bitter taste. The Asian and North American black velvet bolete,T.alboater, has a black to grayish-brown cap and grows in deciduous woods. T.violatinctus, found in eastern North America, has whitish pores, a smooth stipe, and a <b>somewhat</b> paler cap than S.eximius.|$|E
5|$|A creak is a rapid {{series of}} {{high-frequency}} clicks that sounds <b>somewhat</b> like a creaky door hinge. It is typically used when homing in on prey.|$|E
5|$|A fastidious and <b>somewhat</b> {{withdrawn}} individual, Balfour {{succumbed to}} alcoholism in his fifties. This brought about his early death.|$|E
5|$|A {{third variety}} of {{objection}} <b>somewhat</b> {{related to the}} problem of 'weakness of will' is that difficulties arise when we try to keep critical thinking separate from intuitive thinking.|$|E
5|$|Atman is the {{predominantly}} discussed {{topic in the}} Upanishads, but they express two distinct, <b>somewhat</b> divergent themes. Some state that Brahman (Highest Reality, Universal Principle, Being-Consciousness-Bliss) is identical with Atman, while others state Atman is part of Brahman but not identical. This ancient debate flowered into various dual, non-dual theories in Hinduism. The Brahmasutra by Badarayana (~ 100 BCE) synthesized and unified these <b>somewhat</b> conflicting theories, stating that Atman and Brahman are different in some respects particularly during the state of ignorance, but at the deepest level and {{in the state of}} self-realization, Atman and Brahman are identical, non-different.|$|E

5|$|In June 2005, ECMA {{approved}} edition 3 of the C# specification, {{and updated}} ECMA-334. Additions included partial classes, anonymous methods, nullable types, and generics (<b>somewhat</b> similar to C++ templates).|$|E
5|$|In fact, {{formation}} models {{indicate that}} the planet has a gaseous envelope, <b>somewhat</b> less massive than 20% of it total mass, which account for ≈60% of its radius (or ≈90% of its volume).|$|E
5|$|It {{is often}} {{suggested}} that the Last Sonata, in B-flat major, is a farewell work in which Schubert faces his own death (<b>somewhat</b> analogous to the myths surrounding Mozart's Requiem); this is usually ascribed to the relaxed, meditative character which dominates the two opening movements. Death scenes are also associated, <b>somewhat</b> more explicitly, with the more tragic C minor Sonata; Charles Fisk, for example, mentions ghosts and a 'dance of death', in the outer movements. However, when judging from a biographical point of view, the notion that Schubert felt his imminent death {{at the time of}} composing the last sonatas is questionable.|$|E
5|$|Labradors are <b>somewhat</b> {{prone to}} hip and elbow dysplasia, {{especially}} the larger dogs, {{though not as}} much as some other breeds. Hip scores are recommended before breeding and often joint supplements are recommended.|$|E

5|$|Sultan Iskandar and {{his family}} members were not prosecuted for their past {{violations}} of the law on grounds that the royal immunity was still applicable when the incidences occurred. Nevertheless, shortly after the incident, Sultan Iskandar was prompted {{to take steps to}} rehabilitate his public image, which was more or less tarnished by the incident. In a public speech shortly after the episode, the Sultan was noted to have toned down <b>somewhat</b> on his hardline image and appeared to be <b>somewhat</b> more humble, appealing to Johoreans to maintain their loyalty to him.|$|E

5|$|Tall {{and slender}} forms of Mycena polygramma <b>somewhat</b> {{resemble}} M.pullata or M.praelonga. The former species is distinguished by its color, {{and the latter}} by its relationship to M.alcalina and its habitat on sphagnum.|$|E
5|$|The European species Mycena viridimarginata is <b>somewhat</b> {{similar to}} M.intersecta in appearance, {{but may be}} {{distinguished}} by its greenish-edged gills, cheilocystidia with abruptly tapering points, and clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|The ascospores are smooth, elliptical, {{and measure}} 20–26 by 13–18µm. Asci (spore-bearing cells) are cylindrical, eight-spored, hyaline (translucent) when mounted in dilute (2%) {{potassium}} hydroxide (KOH), and measure 225–330 by 15–25µm. Paraphyses are cylindrical to capitate or moniliform, measuring 95–250 long by 10–25µm wide, and are septate. Their tips are rounded to <b>somewhat</b> club-shaped or infrequently <b>somewhat</b> fuse-shaped. Elements on the sterile ridges are 50–175 by 12.5–20µm, and septate. The terminal cells are club-shaped or nearly so.|$|E
5|$|The babblers, or timaliids, are <b>somewhat</b> {{diverse in}} size and colouration, but are characterised by soft fluffy plumage.|$|E
5|$|The breed is {{preserved}} by various organizations {{because of its}} relevance to American history and its resemblance to historical American sheep. It also possesses some traits that have been <b>somewhat</b> lost in more modern breeds.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} soil in Leonard Harrison State Park is <b>somewhat</b> excessively drained Oquaga channery loam, {{which is}} often associated with well drained Lordstown channery loam. Much of the campground near the eastern boundary is supported by Morris gravelly silt loam, which is <b>somewhat</b> poorly drained due to a subsoil fragipan. The Oquaga tends to be very strongly acidic (pH 4.8), Morris is strongly acidic (pH 5.3) and Lordstown is moderately acidic (pH 5.5). All of these soils belong to the Inceptisol soil order.|$|E
