500|$|Qureshi {{made her}} feature film debut with a {{supporting}} role in Anurag Kashyap's critically acclaimed two-part crime drama Gangs of Wasseypur – Part 1 (2012), where Qureshi was cast as the supportive wife of a criminal (played by Nawazuddin Siddiqui). She described her character as a small-town airhead who thinks she is the prettiest girl in the village: [...] "Mohsina tries to copy everything she sees {{on the big screen}} in her own little ways. She is heavily influenced by Bollywood". The film premiered at the 65th Cannes Film Festival, and both the film and Qureshi received positive reviews from critics. Govind Nihalani noted her screen presence, comparing the actress to Smita Patil: [...] "an earthiness, sincerity, intensity and warmth of personality, qualities that distinguished Smita, apart from {{the fact that she was}} a very fine and instinctive actress. Huma is a good enough actress on her own, someone who can stand apart from the crowd and hold her own". Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama noted: [...] "Huma Qureshi, who's introduced much later in the film...is wonderful". The Express Tribune added: [...] "When it comes to looks, [...] is different from the typical Bollywood actors". In 2012, Qureshi was ranked third, the highest female position, on Rediff.com's annual list of [...] "Bollywood's Top Ten Debutants" [...] (male and female). Following the success of the first part, she reprised her role of Mohsina in the second instalment of the Gangs of Wasseypur series, Gangs of Wasseypur – Part 2. The film premiered in the Cannes Directors' Fortnight at the Cannes Film Festival with its prequel. It opened to wide critical acclaim, and her portrayal again received positive reviews. Madhureeta Mukherjee of The Times of India said: [...] "Huma Qureshi, with her gaudy clothes, designer <b>sun-glasses</b> and unusual attractiveness is the hottest cheez in Wasseypur. She beautifully lends support as a powerful man's 'prouder' better-half, even in his worst crimes", and Taran Adarsh found her [...] "simply fantastic". Both films earned her Best Female Debut and Best Supporting Actress nominations at several award ceremonies (including the Filmfare Award). Qureshi described Gangs of Wasseypur as a [...] "life-changing film".|$|E

He made his first daguerreotype {{in the winter of}} 1840, [...] "using a <b>sun-glass</b> for a lens, a candle box for a camera, and the handle of a silver spoon as a substitute for a plate." [...] Over time he became a prominent daguerreotype portraitist in Boston. In addition to making portraits for the Whipple and Black studio, Whipple photographed important buildings in and around Boston, including the house occupied by General George Washington in 1775 and 1776 (photographed circa 1855, now in the Smithsonian).|$|R
60|$|After {{an early}} breakfast at Morristown the tobacco-pedler--whose name was Dominicus Pike--had {{travelled}} seven miles through a solitary piece of woods without speaking {{a word to}} anybody but himself and his little gray mare. It being nearly seven o'clock, he was as eager to hold a morning gossip as a city shopkeeper to read the morning paper. An opportunity seemed at hand when, after lighting a cigar with a <b>sun-glass,</b> {{he looked up and}} perceived a man coming over the brow of the hill at the foot of which the pedler had stopped his green cart. Dominicus watched him as he descended, and noticed that he carried a bundle over his shoulder {{on the end of a}} stick and travelled with a weary yet determined pace. He did not look as if he had started in the freshness of the morning, but had footed it all night, and meant to do the same all day.|$|R

The sculpture was inaugurated in 1985 and the artist Karl-Göte Bejemark (1922-2000), who also made other popular sculptures depicting famous Swedes such as Greta Garbo and Nils Ferlin, chose natural colours for the sculpture and placed it directly on the pavement to give the impression the troubadour {{is on his way to}} his favourite hangout, Den Gyldene Freden just a block away.|$|E

50|$|Other {{examples}} of cultural performances were related {{with the life}} cycle rites such as Kathaman and Ngantenan. Khataman is a circumcision ceremony {{in which it is}} used as a symbol of a young boy's entrance into adulthood. Normally, Kathaman is applied only to Muslim boys. The boy would be dressed with a dress like an Arab Sheikh, and taken by horse from his house to the nearby mosque. This procession is accompanied with Islamic music. Ngantenan is basically the wedding ceremony, which we can see clearly the influence of Hindu culture. Nevertheless, while welcoming the invitee, the bride and groom would be put {{at the center of the}} house with brights and colourful costumes including the traditional Javanese costumes, Arabic costumes, and supposed to be modern western costumes with <b>sun-glasses.</b> They can change up to seven costumes within 6 hours.|$|E
50|$|Two {{chapters}} mention yangsui mirrors {{to express}} {{skepticism about the}} Chinese myth that the archer Houyi shot down nine of the Ten Suns (children of Di Jun and Xihe) that were burning up earth.We see that with a <b>sun-glass</b> fire 陽遂 is drawn from heaven, the sun being a big fire. Since on earth fire is one fluid, and the earth has not ten fires, how can heaven possess ten suns? Perhaps the so called ten suns are some other things, whose light and shape resembles that of the sun. They are staying in the ‘Hot Water Abyss’, and always climb up Fu-sang. Yü and Yi saw them, and described them as ten suns. (32, tr. Forke 1911: 272-273) These legendary references are to Fusang, Yu, and Yi. The sun is fire: in the sky it is the sun, and on earth it is fire. How shall we prove it? A burning glass 陽遂 being held up towards the sun, fire comes down from heaven. Consequently fire is the solar fluid. The sun is connected with the cycle of ten, but fire is not. How is it that there are ten suns and twelve constellations? The suns are combined with these constellations, therefore jia is joined to zi. But what are the so called ten suns? Are there ten real suns, or is there only one with ten different names? (74, tr. Forke 1911: 412) Jia 甲 and zi 子 are {{the first signs of}} the heavenly stems and earthly branches in the Chinese calendar.|$|R

During the argument, he attacks and attempts to rape her; however, she escapes to Matt's room, which leads Derek and Matt to fight. Christie spends her last day with Matt, his sister Sandra, and Greta, a friend of theirs. They have to wait another whole year before they see each other again since Christie is still in high school and lives on the east coast while Matt lives on the west coast and attends college.|$|E
5000|$|The {{show had}} a number of {{variations}} made to its intro as the program went on. The very earliest version of the intro had Petelius and Kalliala {{make their way to the}} studio while wearing <b>sun-glasses,</b> fedoras and trench-coats with the film sped up for comical effect. Two variants of the intro with the same music were shot, one in the Winter and one in early Spring. A third intro had the Petelius and Kalliala appear as ministers taking a helicopter ride back to their apartment to retrieve a misplaced box of matches. Starting with the show's second season, the theme song became MARRS' 1987 hit Pump up the Volume. This song was accompanied by Petelius and Kalliala dancing and doing physically silly things to the beat of the music as well as mouthing the lyrics [...] "Brothers and sisters! Pump up the volume!" [...] against a red background. Variants of this intro appeared all through the second and third seasons, including a reversed version of the intro and versions with still-images from past skits in-between Kalliala and Petelius dancing.|$|E

Cottage Grove Avenue, which also conducted the ceremony for the younger Stokes. Over 7,000 people filed past Flukey's casket for a final glimpse of the slain mobster. Stokes was mostly spoken of with reverence by the crowd in attendance - one young mourner said of Flukey: [...] "I was walking on the same street he was walking, I went up to him. I spoke to him. He spoke back. I introduced myself. He shook my hand and everything." [...] Mothers were seen lifting their young children above the coffin so they could see Stokes; adorned for his final viewing. He was laid [...] "in a mahogany coffin with a custom-designed powder-blue interior". Stokes wore tinted <b>sun-glasses,</b> [...] "a blue suit, blue silk shirt, blue tie and handkerchief and blue python shoes" [...] and he was holding a portable telephone. The floral arrangements that surrounded him included [...] "cars and dice fashioned from polystyrene foam, illustrating his passion for luxury automobiles and his claim on his income tax returns that his riches came from gambling." ...|$|E

40|$|Except for the skin, {{the eye is}} {{the only}} organ that is {{continuously}} exposed to solar radiation, including longwave ultraviolet irradiation (UVA). Since 8 -methoxypsoralen (8 -MOP) remains {{not only in the}} skin but also in the lens of the eye after 8 -MOP + UVA (PUVA) treatment, wearing protective goggles just during the UVA irradiation is insufficient. It is wise to shield the eyes for several hours after 8 -MOP ingestion, to avoid or reduce possible long-term side effects such as cataract formation. Adequate eye protection from UVA after PUVA can be provided by <b>sun-glasses</b> that filter out the appropriate UVA spectrum from the sunlight. Nearly all the commercially available sunglasses are colored, which reduces the intensity of the visible light reaching the eye. In such cases, the sunglasses. However, the UVA intensity remains the same. As a result, more UVA can reach the lens. In this study, new uncolored glasses are evaluated and compared with commercially available sunglasses (all colored) to determine their UVA transmission. status: publishe...|$|E
