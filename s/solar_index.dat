40|$|An {{updated version}} of a proxy, termed EUV-TEC, {{describing}} the global total primary photoionisation is calculated from satellite-borne EUV measurements assuming a model atmosphere consisting of four major atmospheric constituents.

The EUV-TEC proxy thus describes the ionospheric response to solar EUV radiation and its variability.

[1990]; Macmillan and Droujinina [2007]; Torta et al. [2009]; Elias et al. [2010]; Takeda [2013]. Sellek ([1980]) showed that the annual mean Sq amplitude obtained at San Juan at a low latitude is linearly proportional to the annual mean sunspot numbers using observation data during 1929 to 1965. Schlapp et al. ([1990]) also reported on the linear relationship between the sunspot numbers and Sq amplitude, but they pointed out that the position of the linear regression line is different for each solar cycle. Moreover, their analysis results [Schlapp et al. [1990] shown in the figure (Figure  3) suggest that the maximum value of the Sq amplitude tends not to become very large for an increase in sunspot numbers from 100 to 150. The present statistical analysis results suggest that the relationship between the <b>solar</b> F 10.7 <b>index</b> and Sq amplitude is approximately linear, but the response of the Sq amplitude obtained at 37 of 69 geomagnetic stations is nonlinear to the <b>solar</b> F 10.7 <b>index</b> as shown in Figures  1 and 5. The rate of increase in the Sq amplitude decreases as the <b>solar</b> F 10.7 <b>index</b> becomes high. On the basis of the present analysis results, the assumption of a linear relationship between the Sq amplitude and <b>solar</b> activity <b>index</b> used in the correlation analyses of previous works may not always be correct. Therefore, when we perform the correlation analysis between the <b>solar</b> activity <b>index</b> and the Sq amplitude in order to remove the effects of solar activity, we should consider this nonlinearity for the long-term analysis of the Sq variation at each geomagnetic station.|$|R
