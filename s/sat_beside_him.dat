25|$|Moro {{left his}} house {{a few minutes}} before 9:00. He was sitting in a blue Fiat 130 driven by Domenico Ricci. Another carabiniere, marshal Oreste Leonardi, <b>sat</b> <b>beside</b> <b>him.</b> Leonardi {{was the head of the}} {{bodyguard}} team. The Fiat 130 was followed by a white Alfetta with the remaining bodyguards: Francesco Zizzi, Giulio Rivera and Raffaele Iozzino.|$|E
2500|$|However, he was {{reportedly}} [...] "extremely charitable" [...] to the pages {{who worked at}} the Court, and had a great love of children. For example, he gave very generous assistance and adopted thirty-three children who were victims of the German bombing of London in 1940, and left a sizable fortune to charity. When Oliver Wendell Holmes's wife died, McReynolds broke down and wept at her funeral. Holmes wrote in 1926: [...] "Poor McReynolds is, I think, a man of feeling and of more secret kindliness than he would get credit for." [...] He would often entertain at his apartment, and even passed cigarettes to his guests on occasion. He often invited people for brunch on Sunday mornings. According to William O. Douglas, [...] "On these informal occasions in his own home he was the essence of hospitality and a very delightful companion". Once, when riding to his office on a street car, a drunk got on board and fell out in the aisle. McReynolds picked him up, helped him back to his seat, and <b>sat</b> <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> until they reached the top of Capitol Hill, leaving him only after giving explicit instructions to the conductor. And when due to absence of more senior justices it fell on him to preside in court, [...] "he was the soul of courtesy, graciously greeting and raptly listening to the arguments by lawyers of both sexes". The public Justice McReynolds was noted for his hospitality. He entertained frequently at the Willard Hotel with guest lists of 150 people, including his fellow justices, and at an annual eggnog party {{which was one of the}} social highlights of the Christmas season. Alice Roosevelt, one of many friends, requested the services of his cook, Mrs. Parker, for her wedding breakfast to Nicholas Longworth.|$|E

60|$|Ten minutes later, having {{thrown a}} few things {{together}} into a bag, Kirk took his place at the wheel. Mamie <b>sat</b> <b>beside</b> <b>him.</b> The bag had the rear seat to itself.|$|E
60|$|Again in {{that phrase}} there was {{something}} that stirred a memory in La Tour d'Azyr. He turned in the fresh uproar to speak to his cousin Chabrillane who <b>sat</b> <b>beside</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|Skip {{threw himself}} on the floor {{close to the end}} of the cutting, as if {{reconciled}} to whatever might happen, and Sam <b>sat</b> down <b>beside</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{have often}} wondered," [...] said Angut, as the seaman <b>sat</b> down <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "at the contentment and good-humour and cheerfulness, {{sometimes}} running into fun, of that poor old woman Kannoa." ...|$|R
