25|$|In the 1980s and 1990s some {{began to}} see the {{advancing}} theories in ecofeminism as essentialist. Through analysis done by post structural and third wave feminists it was argued that ecofeminism equated women with nature. This dichotomy is dangerous because it groups all women into one category and enforces the very societal norms that feminism is trying to break. Out of this critique rose the anti-essentialist argument. Ecofeminist and author Noel Sturgeon <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> interview that what anti-essentialists are critiquing is a strategy used to mobilize large and diverse groups of both theorists and activists.|$|E
25|$|It is {{uncertain}} {{who wrote the}} note. Leach {{has said that the}} handwriting {{on the front of the}} document most closely resembles that of either Menella or Violet Dodgson, Dodgson's nieces. However, Morton N. Cohen <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> article published in the Times Literary Supplement in 2003 that in the 1960s, Dodgson's great-nephew Philip Dodgson Jacques told him that Jacques had written the note himself based on conversations he remembered with Dodgson's nieces. Cohen's article offered no evidence to support this, however, and known samples of Jacques' handwriting do not seem to resemble the writing of the note.|$|E

It's like a road show and Stewie and Brian teleport themselves to Las Vegas, {{but in the process}} [...] unknowingly create a duplicate of one another." [...] In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Callaghan recalled the scene in the episode where Brian and Stewie consider joint suicide the most difficult scene for him to write in 2012.|$|E

500|$|The book's {{third group}} of essays {{analyzes}} the rationale of self-defence as {{a justification for}} targeted killing. Washburn University School of Law professor Craig Martin writes in [...] "Going Medieval: Targeted Killing, Self-Defense and the Jus ad Bellum Regime" [...] that self-defence is not an appropriate rationale for targeted killing because such a justification is restricted to conflicts between state actors. University of Tulsa School of Law professor Russell Christopher writes in [...] "Imminence in Justified Targeted Killing" [...] that self-defence should be ruled out as a suitable position in several examples of potential conflict. He critiques arguments by governments including the United Kingdom and the United States that self-defense {{can be used as}} a rationalization of action against imminent danger. Western Washington University emeritus philosophy professor Phillip Montague <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> essay titled [...] "Defending Defensive Targeted Killings" [...] that use of this tactic against combatants can be seen as defensible and justified acts against terrorism or those who assist terrorist organizations.|$|E
500|$|Jim (John Krasinski) deduces {{over the}} course of the day that Michael is leaving early and confronts him about it. Michael admits his plans, and begins a {{personal}} goodbye, but breaks down after a few words. Jim, trying to hold back tears, in turn says how much he respects Michael, and that Michael was the best boss he ever had and they jokingly promise to have a proper goodbye over lunch the next day. Michael's cab to the airport then arrives, and Michael departs the office after one last look at the employees, exiting silently. His cab pulls out of the parking lot just as Pam is pulling in. At the airport, Michael asks the camera crew to inform him if the documentary ever airs, then turns over his microphone, quipping one last [...] "That's what she said" [...] about how good it will feel to [...] "get this thing [...] off [...] chest". He begins to walk off when Pam makes it past security and runs up to him. They hug twice and say goodbyes that are not heard by the camera. Pam <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> interview that Michael was not sad, that he was hopeful and excited to start his new life with Holly. Pam stands at the gate and watches Michael's plane take off.|$|E
500|$|Later on, Meg knocks Brian out, {{puts him}} {{in the trunk of}} his car and drives away. Chris tells Lois that he saw this, so Lois, Peter, Cleveland, Joe and Quagmire track them down at the Barrington Hotel. When they arrive, they see Meg has tied Brian up with {{packaging}} tape and is about to rape Brian. Lois tells Meg that she is not thinking right, although Meg insists that she has never been more sure of anything in her life. Lois struggles to explain and says Meg does not know what she needs, and then Quagmire <b>says</b> (<b>in</b> <b>an</b> erotic tone) [...] "I know what she needs... Bring her by my house around 8:30 tonight I'll take care of her." [...] This implies that he will try to take advantage of Meg and when she arrives at Quagmire's house, it seems even more likely; he tells her to sit down and says [...] "Soon it'll all become clear", puts on seductive music, dims the lights, strips down to a speedo and sits down beside her; but suddenly, Quagmire (uncharacteristically) begins to have a serious heart-to-heart talk with Meg, telling her that her entire life is still ahead of her and she should not be in such a hurry to grow up before assuring her that she will find the right person one day. To help Meg, Quagmire gives her his copy of The Missing Piece to help give her a better perception of things, and sends her away feeling much better. He then walks into his bedroom, where two of his one-night stands await with an array of sex toys, {{and it turns out that}} all of Quagmire's seemingly erotic antics were actually in preparation for this tryst. One of the women asks Quagmire if he has the [...] "hwhip" [...] (with emphasis on the [...] "h") and Quagmire responds with disbelief.|$|E

500|$|While {{working on}} the Pawnee summer catalog, Leslie (Amy Poehler) excitedly organizes a reunion between Ron (Nick Offerman) and his three predecessors. She anticipates a joyous {{occasion}} and plans {{to write a letter}} about it for the catalog. However, none of the four men get along with each other, and all of them are difficult to get along with. One of them (Dakin Matthews) litters repeatedly, treats everybody disrespectfully, and cheerfully says he never gave a damn about the Parks department and only took the job because it had an easy path to job security and a lucrative pension. Another one (Jack Wallace) exhibits a sexist attitude, and tells Leslie she should not be working there due to menstruation issues. The third (Michael Gross) constantly talks about his affinity for marijuana, {{going so far as to}} say [...] "I've planted marijuana in community gardens across this city," [...] and particularly clashes with Ron (who forced him out of the position years ago) who cheerfully confirms he screwed his predecessor over and otherwise is his usual detached self. Later, a frustrated Leslie decides she cannot write the catalog letter; she stops treating the former directors with any respect by telling the sexist to shut up and calling them [...] "turds" [...] when she briefly takes a throwaway picture and then walks away from without another word. Ron takes her out to dinner to apologize, and the two process their mutual respect for each other, and vow they will never grow to hate each other the way the four former directors do. Ron even tells Leslie that he wants her to take over his Parks Director position if he becomes Pawnee's City Manager. However, Ron cheerfully <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> interview that one of his first acts as City Manager would be to eliminate the Parks department, while Leslie gives an equally upbeat interview where she says one of her first acts as City Manager, were she to leapfrog Ron for the job, would be to double the department's size.|$|E

2500|$|The Notorious Bettie Page, {{released}} in 2005, {{is about the}} 1950s pinup model who became a cult icon of sexuality and who helped popularize pornography. Harron shows Page {{as the daughter of}} religious and conservative parents, as well as the fetish symbol who became a target of a Senate investigation of pornography. For this film, Harron did historical character research, and interviewed several of Page's friends as well as her first husband. Page was legally bound to another project and was thus unable to do an interview, but not being attached to Page meant that Harron was free to create a subjective representation of her. Harron saw Page as an unwitting feminist figure who represented a movement for women's sexual liberation, ironically similar, yet dissimilar to Solanas.

2500|$|... "Jaka's Story", {{a tragic}} {{character}} study dealing with gender roles {{and the political}} suppression of art, is generally cited as the series' pinnacle of narrative achievement. Later issues of the series became highly personal and began to alienate many long-time fans, his female readers especially. Issue #186 (collected in Reads) contained a lengthy prose section that was attacked by some readers and critics for what they perceived as overt misogyny, but which Sim describes as [...] "anti-feminism". During {{this part of the}} story, the storyline consisted of a textual treatise written by Viktor Davis, a fictional [...] "reads" [...] author, interspersed with the main Cerebus storyline. [...] In Davis' material, he refers to the [...] "creative male light" [...] and the [...] "emotional female void", a reversal of the gender-based view of creation espoused by the Judge at the end of Church and State (namely, the [...] "female light" [...] being raped by the [...] "male void" [...] and shattering into the physical universe). As Sim himself <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> interview with The Comics Journal, [...] "Cerebus #1-200 [...] the completion of the story. The yin and yang. The ultra-female reading. The ultra-male reading. I'm attaching an allegory to the Big Bang. You make up your mind which one's the pit and which one's the top of the mountain." [...] By the end of the series, the Void is again male and identified as God, and the Light is female, now identified with YHWH. Issue #186 was followed by an even harsher essay in the back of issue #265 called [...] "Tangent", in which Sim identified a [...] "feminist/homosexualist axis" [...] that opposed traditional and rational societal values. [...] This material appeared as Sim was retreating from public life and becoming more marginalized by his peers in the industry.|$|E
