In MVDC systems, shipboard loads are normally fed through power-converters {{directly connected to}} the MVDC bus. For such systems a key design goal is voltage <b>stability,</b> <b>impaired</b> {{by the presence of}} high-bandwidth controlled loads (Constant Power Loads, CPLs). The paper proposes an approach to stabilize the MVDC bus using the generating systems as sources of stabilizing power. Fast controlled DC/DC converters, interfacing generators to MVDC bus, are employed to control it in a stable way and to provide power sharing among the generators. To this aim, an Active Damping method is exploited. A supplementary Linearization via State Feedback control is utilized to stabilize DC/DC load converters feeding particularly impacting CPLs. Proposed controls are verified by means of time-domain numerical simulations. Shipboard feasibility and performance of the proposed control systems are most considered in the work as conclusions...|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} {{share of}} patients with phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency benefits from pharmacological doses of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH 4), the natural PAH cofactor. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is hypothesized to be a conformational disease, with loss of function due to protein destabilization, and the restoration of enzyme function that is observed in BH 4 treatment might be transmitted by correction of protein misfolding. To elucidate the molecular basis of functional impairment in PAH deficiency, we investigated the impact of ten PAH gene mutations identified in patients with BH 4 -responsiveness on enzyme kinetics, stability, and conformation of the protein (F 55 L, I 65 S, H 170 Q, P 275 L, A 300 S, S 310 Y, P 314 S, R 408 W, Y 414 C, Y 417 H). Residual enzyme activity was generally high, but allostery was disturbed in almost all cases and pointed to altered protein conformation. This was confirmed by reduced proteolytic <b>stability,</b> <b>impaired</b> tetramer assembly or aggregation, increased hydrophobicity, and accelerated thermal unfolding—with particular impact on the regulatory domain—observed in most variants. Three-dimensional modeling revealed the involvement of functionally relevant amino acid networks that may communicate misfolding throughout the protein. Our results substantiate the view that PAH deficiency is a protein-misfolding disease in which global conformational changes hinder molecular motions essential for physiological enzyme function. Thus, PKU has evolved from {{a model of a}} genetic disease that leads to severe neurological impairment to a model of a treatable protein-folding disease with loss of function...|$|E

Mutations that impair Rag 2 function can lead to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), a condition characterized by complete absence of T and B cells, or Omenn syndrome (OS), a form of SCID characterized by the virtual absence of B cells and the presence of oligoclonal autoreactive T cells. Here, we present a comparative study of a panel of mutations that were identified in the noncanonical plant homeodomain (PHD) of Rag 2 in patients with SCID or OS. We show that PHD mutant mouse Rag 2 proteins that correspond to those found in these patients greatly impaired endogenous recombination of Ig gene segments in a Rag 2 -deficient pro-B cell line and that this correlated with decreased protein <b>stability,</b> <b>impaired</b> nuclear localization, and/or loss of the interaction between Rag 2 and core histones. Our results demonstrate that point mutations in the PHD of Rag 2 compromise the functionality of the entire protein, thus explaining why the phenotype of cells expressing PHD point mutants differs from those expressing core Rag 2 protein that lacks the entire C-terminal region and is therefore devoid of the regulation imposed by the PHD. Together, our findings reveal the various deleterious effects of PHD Rag 2 mutations and demonstrate the crucial role of this domain in regulating antigen receptor gene assembly. We believe these results reveal new mechanisms of immunodeficiency in SCID and OS...|$|E

Although autosomal recessive early onset PD linked to parkin mutations does not exhibit a-Synuclein accumulation, while autosomal dominant and sporadic PD manifest with a-Synuclein inclusions, loss of dopaminergic substantia nigra neurons is a common denominator in PD. Here we show that decreased parkin ubiquitination and loss of parkin <b>stability</b> <b>impair</b> interaction with Beclin- 1 and alter a-Synuclein degradation, leading to death of dopaminergic neurons. Tyrosine kinase inhibition increases parkin ubiquitination and interaction with Beclin- 1, promoting autophagic a-Synuclein clearance and nigral neuron survival. However, loss of parkin via deletion increases a-Synuclein in the blood compared to the brain, suggesting that functional parkin prevents a-Synuclein release into the blood. These studies demonstrate that parkin ubiquitination affects its protein stability and E 3 ligase activity, possibly leading to a-Synuclein sequestration and subsequent clearance...|$|R

Loss aversion, whereby losses loom larger than gains, is typically examined in relation to decisions about anticipated outcomes. Here, using subjective-well-being data from Germany (N = 28, 723) and the United Kingdom (N = 20, 570), we found that losses in income have a larger effect on well-being than equivalent income gains and that this effect is not explained by diminishing marginal benefits of income to well-being. Our findings show that loss aversion applies to experienced losses, challenging suggestions that loss aversion is only an affective-forecasting error. By failing to account for loss aversion, longitudinal studies {{of the relationship between}} income and well-being may have overestimated the positive effect of income on well-being. Moreover, societal well-being might best be served by small and stable income increases, even if such <b>stability</b> <b>impairs</b> long-term income growth...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{growth of}} new blood vessels by {{angiogenesis}} and their stabilization by {{the recruitment of}} perivascular mural cells {{are thought to be}} two sequential, yet independent events. Here we identify molecular links between both processes through the βPix and integrin αvβ 8 proteins. Bubblehead (bbh) mutants with a genetic mutation in βPix show defective vascular stabilization. βPix is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor and scaffold protein that binds many proteins including Git 1, which bridges βPix to integrins at focal adhesions. Here we show that the ability of βPix to stabilize vessels requires Git 1 binding residues. Knockdown of Git 1 leads to a hemorrhage phenotype similar to loss of integrin αv, integrin β 8 or βPix, suggesting that vascular stabilization through βPix involves interactions with integrins. Furthermore, double loss of function of βPix and integrin αv shows enhanced hemorrhage rates. Not only is vascular <b>stability</b> <b>impaired</b> in these embryos, but we also uncover a novel role of both βPix and integrin αvβ 8 in cerebral angiogenesis. Downregulation of either βPix or integrin αvβ 8 results in fewer and morphologically abnormal cerebral arteries penetrating the hindbrain. We show that this is coupled with a significant reduction in endothelial cell proliferation in bbh mutants or integrin αvβ 8 morphants. These data suggest that a complex involving βPix, GIT 1 and integrin αvβ 8 may regulate vascular stability, cerebral angiogenesis and endothelial cell proliferation in the developing embryo...|$|E
40|$|Molecular chaperones are {{indispensable}} cellular {{components that}} assist folding and assembly of newly synthesized proteins, translocation of proteins across membranes, {{as well as}} refolding and degrading of misfolded and aggregated proteins. In the last few years, innovative therapeutic strategies targeting stability and functionality of chaperones have received great attention, particularly {{in the field of}} neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, the growing number of diseases found linked to chaperone mutations, testifies to the importance of their role in the cellular protein-quality control mechanism. The investigation of the biophysical interactions between chaperones and specific proteins involved in diseases, including their structural and functional properties, are therefore a crucial step for both validating the chaperones’ role in physiological and pathological state, and developing effective chaperones-based treatment approaches. In the present PhD thesis work, we studied two representative examples of human molecular chaperones, Hsp 60 and CCT/TRiC, appertaining to the class of the so-called “chaperonins” (Cpns). They are large, hollow, ATP-dependent nanomachines that promote correct folding {{of a wide range of}} proteins. Heat shock protein (Hsp 60) is a molecular chaperone that assists protein folding in mitochondria. Hsp 60 can accumulate in the cytosol, in various pathological conditions (i. e., cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases). Here we studied its functional oligomeric equilibrium as compared to that of its well-known bacterial homolog GroEL. We also show that Hsp 60 is capable of inhibiting the fibrillogenesis of Aβ peptide (the protein involved in Alzheimer’s disease). The probable inhibition mechanism operating at molecular level is discussed. CCT/TriC is a chaperon universally found in Archaea and eukaryotes. Several chaperonopathies linked to CCT loci are clinically well characterized and, for those due to non-lethal genetic mutations, there is considerable information on their mode of inheritance. A protein model has been recently developed to investigate the mechanism of a crippling hereditary sensory neuropathy, due to a point mutation (His 147 Arg) in CCT 5, one of the eight subunits of the human CCT. Here we report quantitative information on the loss of structural <b>stability</b> <b>impaired</b> by the pathogenic mutation. Finally, we tested if an eﬃcient inhibition of amyloid formation can be achieved by chaperone-like systems, like as α-Caseins, which is known to exert a stabilizing function through direct interaction (similar to small Hsps). In fact, the evaluation of the mechanism of chaperone-like activity proved helpful for better understanding the structural basis of the substrate binding in sHsps...|$|E

Copper-matrix {{composites}} are versatile {{materials used}} in several electromechanical applications, but relatively low strength and thermal <b>stability</b> <b>impair</b> advanced uses. Development of robust solutions combining low wear and low electrical loss are thus paramount. This work proposes high-energy milling of copper-graphite-alumina powders: graphite is conductive and self-lubricating; alumina toils as dispersion-strengthener and grain refiner. Tailored batches with 2 wt%-graphite and 2 wt%-alumina were milled up to 16 h in planetary ball mill and characterized by XRD, FEG-SEM/EDS, microhardness and Raman. Produced powders are nanostructured, containing graphite and alumina nanoparticles homogeneously distributed in copper. Increasing milling time results in some degree of nanographite amorphization and size decrease. Copper crystallite size and achieved hardness are affected mainly above 4 h milling. Attained results suggest that efficient dispersion of graphite and alumina nanoparticles is achieved, envisaging high conductivity, high strength and thermal stability. The copper-graphite-alumina system thus seemingly opens an opportunity window for PM processing of advanced copper composites...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: The BTB-KELCH protein Gigaxonin plays {{key roles}} in {{sustaining}} neuron survival and cytoskeleton architecture. Indeed, recessive mutations in the Gigaxonin-encoding gene cause Giant Axonal Neuropathy (GAN), a severe neurodegenerative disorder {{characterized by a}} wide disorganization of the Intermediate Filament network. Growing evidences suggest that GAN is a continuum with the peripheral neuropathy Charcot-Marie-Tooth diseases type 2 (CMT 2). Sharing similar sensory-motor alterations and aggregation of Neurofilaments, few reports have revealed that GAN and some CMT 2 forms can be misdiagnosed on clinical and histopathological examination. The goal {{of this study is}} to propose a new differential diagnostic test for GAN/CMT 2. Moreover, we aim at identifying the mechanisms causing the loss-of-function of Gigaxonin, which has been proposed to bind CUL 3 and substrates as part of an E 3 ligase complex. RESULTS: We establish that determining Gigaxonin level constitutes a very valuable diagnostic test in discriminating new GAN cases from clinically related inherited neuropathies. Indeed, in a set of seven new families presenting a neuropathy resembling GAN/CMT 2, only five exhibiting a reduced Gigaxonin abundance have been subsequently genetically linked to GAN. Generating the homology modeling of Gigaxonin, we suggest that disease mutations would lead to a range of defects in Gigaxonin <b>stability,</b> <b>impairing</b> its homodimerization, BTB or KELCH domain folding, or CUL 3 and substrate binding. We further demonstrate that regardless of the mutations or the severity of the disease, Gigaxonin abundance is severely reduced in all GAN patients due to both mRNA and protein instability mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we developed a new penetrant and specific test to diagnose GAN among a set of individuals exhibiting CMT 2 of unknown etiology to suggest that the prevalence of GAN is probably under-evaluated among peripheral neuropathies. We propose to use this new test in concert with the clinical examination and prior to the systematic screening of GAN mutations that has shown strong limitations for large deletions. Combining the generation of the structural modeling of Gigaxonin to an analysis of Gigaxonin transcripts and proteins in patients, we provide the first evidences of the instability of this E 3 ligase adaptor in disease...|$|R
40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado al XXXIX Congreso de la Sociedad Española de Bioquímica y Biología Molecular, celebrado en Salamanca del 5 al 8 de septiembre de 2016. Maintenance of genome {{integrity}} {{is a vital}} aspect of our cellular physiology. Our hereditary information encoded in the DNA is constantly threatened by both endogenous and environmental genotoxic stresses that could alter our genomic material. To combat this threat, eukaryotic cells have evolved a series of mechanisms, collectively known as DDR, to survey several features of the cellular response, including the detection of the lesion, a transient cell cycle arrest and the repair of the broken DNA. During the last years it has becoming clearer the biochemical mechanisms operating at each stage of the DDR. However, {{little is known about}} the spatial regulation of their components during the DNA damage response and how the relocation of the DNA lesion itself can influence in the repair process. Interestingly, previous studies have indicated that DNA breaks are re-localized from the nucleoplasm to the nuclear periphery, suggesting that nuclear compartmentalization of DNA lesions could comprise another layer in the regulation of the DNA repair pathway. Nevertheless, whether the nuclear periphery harbours an environment that is permissive for DNA repair and its implications in maintaining genome {{integrity is}} a subject that still under debate. Remarkably, new data coming from our group indicate that the cell cycle phosphatase Cdc 14 is involved in DNA repair by controlling the tethering of a DNA lesion into the spindle pole body (SPB) region of the nuclear envelope. This function is attained by preserving the integrity of the metaphase spindle, a vital requirement to stimulate DSB-SPB interaction and thus DNA repair. Accordingly, disruption of spindle <b>stability</b> <b>impairs</b> both DSB-SPB interaction and DNA repair by homologous recombination. These observations directly connect spindle integrity with DNA repair and reveal that DSBs are preferentially tethered to the SPBs to be restored. Importantly, this new function of Cdc 14 could provide a physiological mechanism that spatially regulates the DNA damage response and therefore the fate of the repair process. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

Catecholamine, particularly dopamine, transmission has been proposed to modulate the balance between the stability and flexibility of working memory representations. However, {{it is unclear whether}} drugs that increase catecholamine transmission, such as methylphenidate, optimize this balance in a task-dependent manner or bias the system toward stability at the expense of flexibility (or vice versa).

These behavioral effects were accompanied by task-general effects in the striatum and opposite and task-specific effects on neural signal in the pFC. This suggests that methylphenidate exerts its cognitive enhancing and impairing effects through acting on the pFC, an effect likely associated with methylphenidate's action on the striatum. These findings highlight that methylphenidate acts as a double-edged sword, improving one cognitive function at the expense of another, while also elucidating the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying these paradoxical effects...|$|R

The relative levels of incorporated ribonucleotides reflect that DNA polymerase γ discriminates the four ribonucleotides differentially during DNA synthesis. The observed pattern is also dependent on the mitochondrial deoxyribonucleotide (dNTP) pools and disease-causing mutations that change these pools alter both the absolute and relative levels of incorporated ribonucleotides. Our analyses strongly suggest that DNA polymerase γ-dependent incorporation is the main source of ribonucleotides in mtDNA and argues against the existence of a mitochondrial ribonucleotide excision repair pathway in human cells. Furthermore, we clearly demonstrate that when dNTP pools are limiting, ribonucleotides serve as a source of building blocks to maintain DNA replication.

We investigated the consequence of three missense mutations, G 202 A, R 346 W and R 135 C of DHODH, which were previously identified in patients with Miller syndrome. First, we established HeLa cell lines stably expressing DHODH with Miller syndrome-causative mutations: G 202 A, R 346 W and R 135 C. These three mutant proteins retained the proper mitochondrial localization based on immunohistochemistry and mitochondrial subfractionation studies. The G 202 A, R 346 W DHODH proteins showed reduced protein stability.

Codon usage is also implicated in the control of transcription, splicing and RNA structure 4 – 6. Many genes exhibit little codon usage bias, which is thought to reflect a lack of selection for mRNA translation. Alternatively, however, non-optimal codon usage may have biological significance. The rhythmic expression and the proper function of the Neurospora FREQUENCY (FRQ) protein are essential for circadian clock function. Here we show that, unlike most genes in Neurospora, frq exhibits non-optimal codon usage across its entire open reading frame. Optimization of frq codon usage abolishes both overt and molecular circadian rhythms. Codon optimization not only increases FRQ level but surprisingly, also results in conformational changes in FRQ protein, altered FRQ phosphorylation profile and <b>stability,</b> and <b>impaired</b> functions in the circadian feedback loops. These results indicate that non-optimal codon usage of frq is essential for its circadian clock function. Our study {{provides an example of}} how non-optimal codon usage functions to regulate protein expression and to achieve optimal protein structure and function...|$|R
40|$|Disaster has a {{negative}} impact on health conditions, especially on those of temporary housing residents. Health status has a close relationship with physical activity and performance. However, few reports have assessed physical performance among residents living in temporary housing. In this study, we compared physical capabilities between the elderly who evacuated to temporary housing and those who stayed in their own homes after the Great East Japan Earthquake. Subjects were recruited from those over 65  years of age who participated in the medical check-ups for temporary housing residents (TH group) or check-ups for residents of downtown areas (control group) in Soma City, Fukushima, in 2012. The subjects underwent grip strength, one-leg standing (OLS), and timed up and go tests (TUG). In total, 1890 participants were recruited. The TH group showed significantly stronger grip strength than that of the control group. On the other hand, the TH group showed weaker standing stability, according to decreased OLS and increased TUG scores. We revealed that standing <b>stability</b> was <b>impaired</b> among elderly temporary housing residents 1. 5  years after the disaster.

40|$|Dysregulated β-catenin {{signaling}} is intricately {{involved in}} {{renal cell carcinoma}} (RCC) carcinogenesis and progression. Determining potential β-catenin signaling inhibitors would be helpful in ameliorating drug resistance in advanced or metastatic RCC. Screening for β-catenin signaling inhibitors involved in silico inquiry of the PubChem Bioactivity database followed by TCF/LEF reporter assay. The biological effects of ovatodiolide were evaluated in 4 RCC cell lines in vitro and 2 RCC cell lines in a mouse xenograft model. The synergistic effects of ovatodiolide and sorafenib or sunitinib were examined in 2 TKI-resistant RCC cell lines. Ovatodiolide, a pure compound of Anisomeles indica, inhibited β-catenin signaling and reduced RCC cell viability, survival, migration/invasion, and in vitro cell or in vivo mouse tumorigenicity. Cytotoxicity was significantly reduced in a normal kidney epithelial cell line with the treatment. Ovatodiolide reduced phosphorylated β-catenin (S 552) that inhibited β-catenin nuclear translocation. Moreover, ovatodiolide decreased β-catenin <b>stability</b> and <b>impaired</b> the association of β-catenin and transcription factor 4. Ovatodiolide combined with sorafenib or sunitinib overcame drug resistance in TKI-resistant RCC cells. Ovatodiolide may be a potent β-catenin signaling inhibitor, with synergistic effects with sorafenib or sunitinib, and therefore, a useful candidate for improving RCC therapy...|$|R
40|$|Pre-mRNA {{processing}} factor 19 (Prp 19) activates pre-mRNA spliceosome {{and also}} mediates DNA damage response. Prp 19 overexpression in cells with functional p 53 leads to decreased apoptosis and increases cell survival after DNA damage. Here {{we showed that}} in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells with inactive p 53 or functional p 53, Prp 19 was down-regulated due to the <b>impaired</b> <b>stability</b> under chemotherapeutic drug treatment. Silencing Prp 19 expression enhanced apoptosis of HCC cells with or without chemotherapeutic drug treatment. Furthermore high level of Prp 19 may inhibit chemotherapeutic drugs induced apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells through modulating myeloid leukemia cell differentiation 1 expression. These results indicated that targeting Prp 19 may potentiate pro-apoptotic effect of chemotherapeutic agents on HCC...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - {{effectiveness}} {{assessment of}} 500 acetabular transpositions after triple pelvic osteotomy {{in the treatment}} of children and adolescents with dysplastic hip joint pathology. Materials and methods. Using clinical, radiographic and computed tomography techniques we analyzed long-term results of surgical treatment of 470 patients with <b>impaired</b> <b>stability</b> of the hip of dysplastic genesis aged 4 - 19 y. o. who underwent 500 acetabular transpositions after triple pelvic osteotomy. Results and conclusions. The use of acetabular transposition after triple pelvic osteotomy in patients with dysplastic hip joint pathology in most cases allows to achieve regression of clinical manifestations and degenerative changes in patients with stage I and II of dysplastic coxarthrosis. Effectiveness largely depends on the initial state of the hip joint...|$|R
