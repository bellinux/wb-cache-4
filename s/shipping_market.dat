5|$|In 2006, the {{sustained}} rise {{in oil prices}} had only a limited impact on demand. It was a good year across all segments of the tanker market segments, but {{not as good as}} 2004 and 2005. Amidst high oil prices, geopolitical tension, and fears of disruptions to the oil supply, growing demand was the main driving force in the tanker <b>shipping</b> <b>market</b> for the year. As demand grew moderately in the United States and Western Europe, expanding economies such as China fueled exponential growth in demand. Despite these strengths, each of the five tanker freight indices dropped during 2006. Product tanker demand increased in 2006 due to economic expansion in Asia, especially China and India, however, average time charter equivalent earnings for these ships decreased compared with the two prior years.|$|E
25|$|The Port of Sacramento {{has always}} been a {{significant}} port on the West Coast of the United States since the 1849 California Gold Rush. It was originally served primarily by paddle steamers which carried cargo from San Francisco Bay up the Sacramento River to Sacramento. Today it receives far less traffic than larger ports and handles primarily agricultural products and other bulk goods rather than containers, which now dominate the <b>shipping</b> <b>market.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{population}} of Norway increased from 150,000 in 1500 to 900,000 in 1800. By 1500 most deserted farms were repossessed. The period under absolutism increased {{the ratio of}} self-owning farmers from twenty to fifty percent, largely through sales of crown land to finance the lost wars. Crofts became common in the absolutism period, especially in Eastern Norway and Trøndelag, with the smallholder living {{at the mercy of}} the farmer. There were 48,000 smallholders in 1800. Compared to Denmark, taxes were very low in Norway, typically at four to ten percent of the harvest, although the number of farms per legd decreased from four to two in the 1670s. Confirmation was introduced in 1736; as it required people to read, elementary education was introduced. The Norwegian economy improved with the introduction of the water-driven saw in the early 16th century. Norway had huge resources of timber but did not have the means to exploit much of it in the Middle Ages as only hand-tools were available. The new saw mills which sprang up in the fjords changed this. In 1544 a deal was struck with the Netherlands (then part of the Holy Roman Empire) and the Dutch controlled the export of Norwegian timber for the next 150 years. Amsterdam was built on piles from Norway. Tree-felling was done in the winter when farm-work was impossible and it was easy to get the felled trees across the snow to the rivers. In the spring, the logs floated down the rivers to the saw mills by the sea. By the mid-16th century the power of the Hanseatic League in Bergen was broken; though German craftsmen remained, they had to accept Danish rule. Many Norwegians earned a living as sailors in foreign ships, especially Dutch ones. The crews in both sides of the Anglo-Dutch Wars contained Norwegians. Norway benefitted from the many European wars of the 18th century. As a neutral power it was able to expand its share of the <b>shipping</b> <b>market.</b> It also supplied timber to foreign navies.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an aggregated econometric {{model of the}} world <b>shipping</b> <b>markets.</b> The model distinguishes between dry cargo and tankers and also between the a) freight market, b) second hand <b>market</b> for <b>ships,</b> C) shipbuilding <b>market,</b> d) scrap market. Chapters 1, 2 of the thesis examine the history of shipping in the last 100 years or so, analyse the cyclical behaviour of the industry, and consider past theoretical attempts at modelling the <b>shipping</b> <b>markets.</b> It is argued that the structure of existing models of the shipping industry is theoretically flawed In its treatment of the demand for new and second hand ships {{as well as in}} the treatment of expectations. Chapter 3 presents a 'new' theoretical model of the behaviour of <b>shipping</b> <b>markets</b> that attempts to remedy these defects. Novel features of this theory are the assumption of 'rational expectations' in <b>shipping</b> <b>markets</b> as well as the treatment of new and second-hand ships as assets, the portfolio demand for which varies with the own expected return relative to the return on other assets. Econometric versions of the theoretical model are estimated from post World War II annual data, separately for the dry cargo and tanker sectors In chapters 4, S. The two models are linked In chapter 6 and the models are used In order to simulate the dynamic response of the <b>shipping</b> <b>markets</b> to anticipated and unanticipated external shocks. A crucial role in the adjustment process is played by the forward looking speculative positions of investors in the second hand and newbuilding markets. Chapter 7 tests the assumption of the rational expectations hypothesis in the <b>shipping</b> <b>markets</b> by examining the evidence from the freight futures, time charter and new building markets. The stochastic behaviour of these variables is examined and statistical tests are performed in order to Investigate the extent to which this Is considered to be consistent -with the efficient markets / rational expectations hypothesis. The results are somewhat mixed. Chapter 8 illustrates how the model can be used for real world forecasting purposes and scenario planning...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{existing}} {{literature on the}} application of real options in maritime economics is rather limited. Bendall & Stent (2003, 2005, 2007) show how investing in a new ship or maritime technology can incor-porate an option value. Another application is elaborated by Bjerksund & Ekern (1995), discussing the value of mean-reverting cash flows through contingent claim analysis, applied to time charters. The analysis of the entry and exit decision in the <b>shipping</b> <b>markets</b> can form an interesting extension of this research. <b>Shipping</b> <b>markets</b> are in nature uncertain and cyclical (Stopford, 2009). For this reason, the real options based model of Ruiz-Aliseda & Wu (2012) for stochastically cyclical markets will be ap-plied to the <b>shipping</b> <b>markets,</b> in order to define entry and exit thresholds in this market.

It focuses specifically on the factor of 'time lag' between different shipping segments through a comprehensive econometric analysis.
