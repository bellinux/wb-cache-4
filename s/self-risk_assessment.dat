40|$|Needle and syringe sharing {{is common}} {{among people who}} inject drugs and so is {{unprotected}} sex, which consequently puts their sex partners at risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV and other blood-borne infections, like hepatitis. We undertook a nested study with the regular female partners of men who inject drugs participating in a longitudinal HIV incidence study in Delhi, India. In-depth {{interviews were conducted with}} female partners of 32 men. The interviews aimed to gather focused and contextual knowledge of determinants of safe sex and reproductive health needs of these women. Information obtained through interviews was triangulated and linked to the baseline behavioural data of their partner (index men who injected drugs). The study findings illustrate that women in monogamous relationships have a low perception of STI- and HIV-related risk. Additionally, lack of awareness about hepatitis B and C is a cause of concern. Findings also suggest impact of male drug use on the fertility of the female partner. It is critical to empower regular female partners to build their <b>self-risk</b> <b>assessment</b> skills and self-efficacy to negotiate condom use. Future work must explore the role of drug abuse among men who inject drugs in predicting fertility and reproductive morbidity among their female partners...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: In 2009, the Department of Health WA {{launched}} Get the Facts (www. getthefacts. healthwa. gov. au) {{to provide}} sexual health and relationships information to youth aged 14 to 17 years. The website features {{a range of}} interactive features, including online chlamydia <b>self-risk</b> <b>assessment</b> and free testing, an email question and answer service, and a search function for sexual health services. Methods: Browsing behaviours on the site reflected general online behaviour trends among youth: Many youth browse via smartphones and tablets and frequent social networking sites. Additionally, search engines are the primary portal of information for most youth. Results: In response to an independent evaluation conducted in 2010, the website was given a new ‘skin’ in April 2012 featuring updated artwork and photographs of youth from the target population. This {{was followed by a}} sustained 20 % increase in website traffic for 11 months. In November 2012, a mobile version of the website optimised for smart phone devices was launched. Advertising on Facebook increased website referral traffic by 4000 %. Search Engine Optimisation [SEO], implemented in January 2013 to improve rankings on various search engines, was followed by a 20 % increase in website traffic and positive responses from the public. Conclusions: Websites must be developed and promoted according to the browsing behaviour of end-users and technology trends to ensure maximum exposure and high traffic. For this reason, Get the Facts is being further-developed to include map and navigation functionality and to provide a tailored browsing experience based upon individual visit purposes. Continued online promotion and increased SEO is also planned...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Early {{diagnosis}} of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) allows for appropriately timed interventions with improved outcomes, but HIV screening among asymptomatic persons and the general population in Singapore remains low. In 2008, Singapore's Ministry of Health implemented HIV voluntary opt-out screening (VOS) for hospitalised adults. We evaluated the outcome of VOS and surveyed reasons for its low uptake in our institution. METHODS: We assessed the outcomes of the VOS programme from January 2010 to December 2013 at National University Hospital, a 1081 -bed tertiary hospital in Singapore. We also examined reasons for opting-in and opting-out using an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire in a representative sample in January 2013. RESULTS: 107, 523 patients fulfilled VOS criteria and were offered HIV screening, of which 5215 (4. 9 %) agreed to testing. 4850 (93. 1 %) of those who opted-in had an HIV test done. Three (0. 06 %) tested positive for HIV. 238 patients (14. 2 %) were surveyed regarding reasons for opting-in or out of VOS. 21 (8. 8 %) had opted-in. Patients who opted-in {{were likely to be}} younger, more educated and reported having more regular sexual partners. Type of housing, number of casual sexual partners, sexual orientation, intravenous drug use, condom use and previous sexually transmitted infection were not associated with deciding to opt-in/out. Patients' most common reasons for opting-out were: belief that they were at low risk (50. 2 %), belief that they were too old (26. 8 %), cost (6. 9 %) and aversion to venepuncture (6. 5 %). The most common reason for opting-in was desire to know their HIV status (47. 6 %). CONCLUSION: The success of an HIV-VOS program is largely determined by test uptake. Our study showed that the majority of eligible VOS patients opted-out of HIV screening. Given the considerable cost and low yield of this programme, {{more needs to be done}} to better equip patients in <b>self-risk</b> <b>assessment</b> and opting in to testing...|$|E
