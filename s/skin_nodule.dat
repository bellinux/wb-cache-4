40|$|Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma {{very rarely}} affect the neck. We report {{a case of}} a 62 Â year old man who {{presented}} with a right sided skin lump which he noticed after sustaining a neck contusion in a road traffic accident about one year ago. The initial CT and ultrasound scans of the lump were suggestive of a thrombosed varix. Clinical examination showed a hard <b>skin</b> <b>nodule</b> with signs of tethering. He underwent a wide excision of the <b>skin</b> <b>nodule</b> and the histology showed undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma with margins involved. He subsequently underwent another re-excision of margins and pectoralis major flap reconstruction. Following surgery, he was also prescribed adjuvant radiotherapy and he remains well about 12 months after follow up. The surgical management of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma in the neck is challenging due to the proximity of critical neck structures and the need to obtain clear margins. Thus, adjuvant radiotherapy is often used to improve disease control...|$|E

40|$|A 9 -year-old female, {{domestic}} {{short hair}} cat {{was presented with}} sudden onset of polyuria/polydipsia, and hundreds of cutaneous nodules. Prior to referral, the cat had had four <b>skin</b> <b>nodules</b> that were treated with steroids. The four <b>skin</b> <b>nodules</b> then multiplied to form more than 100 ulcerated and nonulcerated nodules located all over the trunk. Clinical evaluation revealed hypothermia and respiratory distress. Cytology from both <b>skin</b> <b>nodules</b> and bronchoalveolar lavage showed macrophages and small organisms whose shape and size were indicative of Toxoplasma spp., or similar organisms. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) serology results were negative. The cat was seropositive for Toxoplasma (IgG 1 : 640) and Neospora (1 : 80) infections. The cat died soon after referral. Necropsy revealed pyothorax, necrotic/purulent pneumonia, haemorrhagic spots on kidneys and mesentery. Histopathology from <b>skin</b> <b>nodules</b> showed diffuse, deep necrotic dermatitis/panniculitis, vasculitis and disseminated free and grouped protozoa. The parasites were found in lungs, spleen, kidneys and liver. Immunohistochemistry on skin tissue with anti-Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum antibodies gave positive results with both. Electron microscopy showed single and grouped tachyzoites with morphological features of T. gondii, often within macrophages. Samples of cutaneous nodules and bronchoalveolar fluid were examined by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for detecting apicomplexa coccidia. PCR results were consistent only with T. gondii infection. Therefore, immunohistochemistry positivity for N. caninum was considered a cross-reaction and a diagnosis of cutaneous and visceral toxoplasmosis was made...|$|R

40|$|This {{work was}} {{proposed}} to study pathologic characteristics of {{lumpy skin disease}} (LSD) among naturally infected cattle and to demonstrate LSDV antigen within different tissues including the <b>skin</b> <b>nodules,</b> regional lymph nodes, lung and liver using PCR and immunohistochemistry. Among the infected cattle, one dairy cattle and 5 calves were dead (mortality rate is 6. 97 %). The major gross alterations in all investigated cases included numerous 1 - 5 cm well circumscribed, round cutaneous nodules covered the whole body in most cases with severe enlargement of superficial lymph nodes. The main microscopical changes were severe ballooning degeneration of the epidermis, dermatitis, with severe vasculitis affecting the dermal blood vessels. Multiple intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions were present in degenerated epidermal cells. Several pathological changes were also detected in the liver, lung, kidney, intestine and lymph nodes. Strong positive PCR signals were appeared in <b>skin</b> <b>nodules,</b> lung and lymph node. Additionally, positive immunoperixodiase reaction was demonstrated in the skin, lung, kidney and lymph nodes. Furthermore, LSDV was isolated on chorio-allantoic membrane (CAM) of spf embryonated chicken eggs from <b>skin</b> <b>nodules</b> and regional lymph nodes collected from dead animals. Virion particles were observed on CAM by electron microscope. Finally, it could be concluded that skin lesions is a constant lesion in both young and adult animals together with systemic infection in severely infected animals...|$|R

40|$|Difficulties {{may arise}} in the {{diagnosis}} of patients with clinical features suggestive of plasma cell dyscrasia-related amyloidosis (amyloidosis L), but without evidence of a paraprotein. We have employed gene rearrangement methodology to demonstrate the clonality of bone marrow cells not only in a patient with myeloma-associated systemic amyloidosis, but also in a patient with âprimaryâ systemic amyloidosis without over myeloma or a detectable paraprotein. Furthermore, we have shown the clonality of the amyloid-producing plasma cells within a <b>skin</b> <b>nodule</b> of a patient with primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis; by contrast, clonal rearrangement was not detected in bone marrow cells from this patient. This finding provides definitive proof that deposits arise in relation to cutaneous plasmacytomas.
