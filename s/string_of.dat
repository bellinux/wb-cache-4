40|$|AbstractComputing in the {{traditional}} sense involves inputs with <b>strings</b> <b>of</b> numbers and symbols rather than words, where words mean probability distributions over input alphabet, and are different from the words in classical formal languages and automata theory. In this paper our goal is to deal with probabilistic finite automata (PFAs), probabilistic Turing machines (PTMs), and probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) by inputting <b>strings</b> <b>of</b> words (probability distributions). Specifically, (i) we verify that PFAs computing <b>strings</b> <b>of</b> words can be implemented by means <b>of</b> calculating <b>strings</b> <b>of</b> symbols (Theorem 1); (ii) we elaborate on PTMs with input <b>strings</b> <b>of</b> words, and particularly demonstrate by describing Example 2 that PTMs computing <b>strings</b> <b>of</b> words may not be directly performed through only computing <b>strings</b> <b>of</b> symbols, i. e., Theorem 1 may not hold for PTMs; (iii) we study PCFGs and thus PRGs with input <b>strings</b> <b>of</b> words, and prove that Theorem 1 does hold for PCFRs and PRGs (Theorem 2); a characterization of PRGs in terms of PFAs, and the equivalence between PCFGs and their Chomsky and Greibach normal forms, {{in the sense that the}} inputs are <b>strings</b> <b>of</b> words, are also presented.

5|$|BoxBoy! is {{a puzzle}} {{platform}} video {{game in which}} players control a square-shaped character named Qbby. The goal {{of the game is}} to guide Qbby through a series of obstacle-filled stages that are divided into sets called worlds. Each world is focussed on a particular gameplay theme; for example one world introduces stages that contain deadly lasers, and another introduces cranes for transporting Qbby around. The central gameplay mechanic is Qbby's ability to create boxes and make use of them to clear the obstacles. Boxes are created one at a time as a connected string and the maximum number of boxes in a string varies between each stage. Qbby can detach the <b>string</b> <b>of</b> boxes then push it to different positions. The boxes can be used to overcome obstacles, such as creating a bridge to pass bottomless pits or building staircases to reach higher platforms. Additionally, Qbby can keep the <b>string</b> <b>of</b> boxes attached to his body. He may then use the boxes as a shield to block hazards such as deadly lasers. He is also able to grapple onto ledges and pull himself up by retracting through the boxes. Creating a new <b>string</b> <b>of</b> boxes causes the previous string to disappear. If Qbby dies, he will respawn at a nearby checkpoint.|$|E
