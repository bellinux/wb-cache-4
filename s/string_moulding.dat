5000|$|Access is {{provided}} to the Long Room from the porch through two doors {{on either side of}} the central projecting semi-circular bay. The doorways housing the double half glazed doors are surmounted with relief lettering [...] "H.M. CUSTOMS" [...] above which sits a corniced shelf. Rectangular windows line the face of the semi-circular bay and forming a lintel to these is a <b>string</b> <b>moulding.</b> The floor of the porch is concrete as are the floors throughout the first floor of the building. A wrought iron balustrade links the columns lining the porch.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} opening off Denham Street, accessed {{through the}} loggia within the projecting portico {{is a substantial}} double timber panelled and moulded door, with semi circular fanlight above, leading into a small entrance vestibule from which double timber framed and glazed doors, also with semi circular fanlight above, give access to the former banking chamber. Surrounding the double timber doors on the external wall is a plaster moulded architrave with prominent keystone. Flanking the doorway are two groups of three round arched window openings fitted with vertical sash windows and fixed louvre timber shutters. The moulded sills of these openings, and {{of those on the}} Quay Street facade of the building are integrated into a continuous <b>string</b> <b>moulding</b> at this level. At the northern end of the Quay Street facade is another entrance, comprising a single six panelled door flanked by sidelights, with a semi circular fanlight above. The first floor level features French door openings that correspond to the openings on the ground floor and also have round arched heads.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} facade, facing Quay Street, {{is dominated}} by the centrally placed round porch to which access is given via two stone stairs starting from concrete steps from the footpath and curving around the projecting porch to the first floor. The porch comprises a row of Corinthian columns following the curve of this facade of the building, which support a semi-circular entablature over which a skillion roof sits. Flanking the porch are short arcaded sections which terminate and are aligned with the end bays of the building. The arcaded sections are formed from full length arched openings which have Italianate balustrading. Above the arches and aligned with them are elliptical openings. The symmetrical end bays have rusticated sandstone faces and an arched opening at first floor level which extends to the ground floor {{in the form of a}} long rectangular window opening. The base of the opening at first floor level has an Italianate balustrade. Flanking the opening at first floor level are pairs of Corinthian pilasters. These pilasters seem to support a <b>string</b> <b>moulding</b> which aligns with the entablature of the porch, forming a cornice along the entire length of the facade, above which a short parapet conceals the roof.|$|E
25|$|The {{architecture}} was of {{red brick}} {{with a blue}} brick base. The façade was decorated in block stone dressings and stone <b>string</b> courses with <b>moulded</b> cornice and cappings.|$|R

50|$|The {{church of}} St John the Baptist was built around 1360. The tower has three stages with {{diagonal}} buttresses, <b>moulded</b> <b>string</b> courses, north-east polygonal higher corner stair turret with blind panelled embattled cap and pierced quatrefoil lozenge parapet with corner pinnacles and gargoyles.|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} is {{in two parts}} with the block on Flinders Street having a rectangular plan form and is of three storeys constructed in brick with a symmetrical rendered facade. The ground floor shopfront has been replaced in anodised aluminium but the original entrance to the upper levels, which has a single panelled timber door with side lights, survives {{to the right of}} this. A short hall leads to a later concrete block stairwell that rises to the top level. Above this is a later horizontal awning and above this three round headed windows with moulded hoods that run into a <b>string</b> <b>mould</b> that runs into piers at the corners of the facade. Similarly there are three rounded headed windows at the top level also with moulded hoods over. All the windows have been replaced in aluminium. Above this is banding with the words [...] "Stationery Warehouse" [...] in raised lettering with cornices above and below. This is surmounted by a parapet with a raised central section which has a segmental top supported on piers. The facade has been recently painted in a contemporary colour scheme. Behind the parapet is a simple corrugated iron roof with a central raised skylight.|$|R

The upper level of the verandah has double timber posts, cast iron balustrades and timber louvred panels above. Between the levels is a <b>moulded</b> <b>string</b> course.|$|R
25|$|Haggs Castle is {{an altered}} L-plan tower, of 4 storeys. The main block {{measures}} around 17m by 7.2m. The vaulted basement contained two chambers and a {{kitchen with a}} large fireplace. The main stair {{led up to the}} first floor, where a private room was located behind the main hall. Smaller corbelled stairs led to the upper storeys, which included a square caphouse above the stair tower. Square and round gun loops were located around the tower. The most striking feature is the carved decoration, including cable-moulded <b>string</b> courses, <b>moulded</b> corbels, and the carving over the door.|$|R
50|$|The western {{extension}} is {{of three}} floors entered by a separate ground floor door. The stair {{is housed in}} a turret and gives access to three floors with a single room on each floor. There is no communication between the extension and the original structure. The brickwork is in English bond with <b>moulded</b> <b>string</b> courses.|$|R
50|$|The {{church was}} {{restored}} in 1859 with further restoration to the four-stage 113.5 ft tower in 1948. The tower has set-back buttresses which develop into crocketted pinnacles {{at the top}} stage. The top displays <b>moulded</b> <b>string</b> courses and a trefoil pierced triangular parapet with gargoyles and corner pinnacles. The belfry stair is in the south-east turret.|$|R
50|$|The west {{tower of}} Charles Church, like St Andrew's, is built of {{limestone}} and granite. It is of three stages, divided by <b>moulded</b> <b>strings</b> and at each angle are double buttresses. The spire is octagonal and is surmounted by {{a ball and}} vane. The tower bears two date stones; 1657 {{on the north side}} and 1708 on the south side.|$|R
50|$|The west {{tower was}} built between 1505 and 1520 and {{contains}} a peal of eight bells, of which two {{were made in}} the 1790s by Thomas Bilbie of the Bilbie family in Cullompton. The three-stage tower has <b>moulded</b> <b>string</b> courses and an angle stair turret in the north-west corner. The clock chimes each quarter-hour in a setting often known as Chard Chimes.|$|R
50|$|Tal-Wejter Tower is {{a three-story}} high tower with a {{rectangular}} plan, with a room on each floor. The upper two floors {{are separated by}} a <b>moulded</b> <b>string</b> course, and the roof has a high parapet wall. Each façade of the tower originally had box machicolations. The entrance to the tower is through an arched doorway built in the medieval style.|$|R
50|$|The Wickham Terrace facade, {{with three}} bays has {{restrained}} Georgian details including oriel windows with decorative mouldings, a centrally located balcony with rendered balustrading and brackets and <b>moulded</b> <b>string</b> course. Rectangular double hung sash windows, with multi-paned upper windows and moulded architraves, define each storey horizontally. The four upper {{floors of the}} building terminate in a projecting dentilled cornice, which does not continue right around the building.|$|R
50|$|The nave is adjoined by aisles on {{the north}} and south sides and the chancel has a chapel on its north side and a vestry to its south. The west tower {{comprises}} three stages. A <b>moulded</b> <b>string</b> course with gargoyles is topped by a battlemented parapet. Single-light cinquefoil headed windows are located on the first stage above the west doorway and {{on each side of the}} second stage. The belfry windows are similar, but two-lighted.|$|R
50|$|The {{principle}} facades of the Bank of NSW building are set on {{the street}} alignments of Flinders and Wickham Streets, and joined by a curved bay at the street corner. The facades are asymmetrical, and are divided by pilasters and by a horizontal <b>moulded</b> <b>string</b> course between the levels. In each bay are sets of windows, mostly double hung but some louvres and fixed lights to the curved bay at the corner, all with external moulded architraves.|$|R
50|$|The core of {{the ground}} floor is a single room meeting hall. It has a high (about 4.5m) boarded ceiling, and awning windows with sills at eye height. The pair of entry doors are six-panelled with an arched fanlight. The eastern end is {{enclosed}} as a kitchen. The western end has the timber stair. It features turned balusters and newels and <b>moulded</b> <b>string.</b> Added to the rear is a small single-storey toilet block clad in fibro sheet.|$|R
5000|$|Local architects Griffiths and Considine, {{representing}} the Melbourne designers Grainger and D'Ebro, described the building thus: The overall treatment to the elevation is a confident Victorian free style interpretation of classical architecture...the facades employ {{a multiplicity of}} classical elements including pediments, rusticated floor, Corinthian pilasters, pediment windows, urns, <b>string</b> courses, heavily <b>moulded</b> architraves and bas relief decoration - all rendered to appear stone...at the roof level [...] "classicism" [...] gives way to an exuberant array of towers not encountered in classical architecture.|$|R
25|$|Another {{particular}} {{feature of}} Romanesque buildings are corbel tables, a projecting <b>moulded</b> <b>string</b> course {{supported by a}} range of corbels. Sometimes these corbels carry a small arcade under the string course, the arches of which are pointed and trefoiled. As a rule corbel tables carries the gutter, but the arcaded corbel table was also used as a decoration to subdivide the storeys and break up the wall surface. In some buildings corbels will form a moulding, and above a plain piece of projecting wall forming a parapet.|$|R
5|$|The Anglican Church of St Mary the Virgin {{dates from}} the late 11th century and was rebuilt in the 15th century. The tower {{contains}} eight bells, of which two {{were made in the}} 1790s by Thomas Bilbie of the Bilbie family in Cullompton. The three-stage tower has <b>moulded</b> <b>string</b> courses and an angle stair turret in the north-west corner. The church has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building. There is a church room, built in 1827. The Baptist Church in Holyrood Street was built in 1842.|$|R
50|$|The nave is adjoined {{along its}} south side by an aisle {{and on the}} eastern end of the north side by a chapel. The chancel has chapels on the north and south sides. The 15th-century west tower is in three stages on a plinth with a battlemented parapet above a <b>moulded</b> <b>string</b> with gargoyles. A taller stair turret, also with battlements and gargoyles, is {{attached}} to the south-east corner. The belfry openings in the third stage are two-lighted with cinquefoiled heads. The second stage contains single light windows with trefoiled heads on the three outward facing sides. The west window above the west door is of three lights and traceried. Attached to {{the south side of the}} tower is a 19th-century or more recent rubble-built vestry with a lean-to roof. The vestry contains a repositioned medieval trefoil-headed window and a 19th-century doorway and window on the south side.The south aisle is 13th century with a plain parapet above a <b>moulded</b> <b>string.</b> A 14th-century window is to the left of the porch with a 19th-century to the right. The wall is buttressed in three places. The porch is 15th-century with a parapet matching the aisle. The inner doorway is probably 14th-century. The south chancel chapel is 12th-century with a lower parapet without a string. The two three-lighted south windows are mostly 19th-century. The window in the east end of the chapel is similar.|$|R
50|$|The chapel wing {{comprises}} two sections: {{the earlier}} 1890 chapel {{toward the front}} elevation {{of the building and}} extending from the rear of this the 1921 extension. Externally, the extension employs stripped classical detailing with rusticated pilasters dividing the external walls and separating the round headed arched openings. Other detailing includes a projecting base, <b>moulded</b> <b>string</b> courses, enlarged keystone detailing above the arched openings and moulded entablature forming a parapet some of which is surmounted by an Italianate baluster detail above. The chapel has a traditional plan, with central nave, side aisles, polygonal sanctuary and a shallow transept extending from the south-western end of the building.|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} {{facade of}} the building comprises the centrally located gable end of the building, abutted to the north east by a smaller gabled section surmounted by a small plaster statue of a rooster. On {{the face of the}} main gabled bay is a centrally located entrance formed by a gabled porch, surmounted by a statue of Our Lady and flanked by plaster moulded pinnacles. Above this is a large traceried stained glass window of five lancets with foils above. The roof is concealed by a <b>moulded</b> <b>string</b> coursed parapet which encircles the building. Surmounting this parapet on the central gable of the front of the building is a Latin Cross.|$|R
50|$|The 14th-century nave is flanked on {{each side}} by aisles added in the 15th century. The {{external}} walls of both the aisles are rag-stone and flint with pieces of tufa. Both aisles feature a <b>moulded</b> <b>string</b> course below a battlemented parapet with corner gargoyles. Each aisle contains two 15th-century three-lighted arched windows in the long side and a window in the west end, each with hood moulds. Towards {{the west end of}} the south aisle is the south porch with three-centred arched internal and external doorways and a crown post roof. On the east corner of the south aisle is a polygonal rood stair turret with a battlemented top.|$|R
5000|$|The Church of The Blessed Virgin Mary and St Peter in Winford {{dates from}} the 15th century.

50|$|The former mining {{exchange}} is clearly discernible as two volumes (1887, 1901) marked by dual pediments on the parapet and separate gabled roofs clad in corrugated metal sheeting, {{with the larger}} 1887 portion lit by a generous roof lantern. A curved awning roof clad in corrugated metal sheeting and supported on slim decorative cast iron posts extends over the footpath along the width of this building and the adjoining premises to the north. Four of six cast iron columns and {{a large proportion of}} a delicate cast iron valance with brackets and pendants survive to the mining exchange building section of awning. A continuous <b>moulded</b> <b>string</b> course also extends across the length of the mining exchange building facade and the adjacent premises.|$|R
50|$|The south eastern facade, {{where the}} {{principal}} entrance is located, is terminated {{at both ends}} by the projecting elevations of the transverse wings. These bays have hipped roofs partially concealed by a decorative parapeted gable, surmounted at the apex by a pedimented feature, supported on reeded pilasters and flanked by pilasters surmounted by finials. Various round and square-headed arched openings, with both recessed and projecting surrounds are found symmetrically arranged on the elevation of the end bays. The south western wing has a more recent one storeyed entrance porch providing access to the chapel. The rendered masonry porch of rectangular plan has two round headed arched openings within a round headed arched recess, and <b>moulded</b> <b>string</b> courses and is surmounted by an entablature above which is an Italianate balustrade.|$|R
5000|$|Principal facades address both streets, with {{entrance}} to the accommodation and dining rooms from Wharf Street and the access to the incorporated ground floor shops from Bazaar Street. The external walls to the street, of bagged and painted brick, are surmounted by a partially rendered brick parapet, concealing a hipped corrugated iron roof. The truncated corner of the hotel is emphasised by a signage panel, projecting beyond the parapet, with [...] "POST OFFICE HOTEL - 1889", surmounted by an open-topped pediment. The parapet features rosettes above <b>moulded</b> <b>string</b> courses supported on paired plaster corbels. Several rendered finials are placed along the parapet, with a slightly larger feature one on each elevation emphasising the principal entrance from that side. The building rests on a rendered masonry base, though which ventilation holes are punched.|$|R
25|$|The south aisle {{is early}} 14th century. It is {{supported}} by twin-stepped clasping buttresses at the south-east and south-west corners, and an angle buttress on the south side. A <b>moulded</b> <b>string</b> course runs at the eaves, and a plinth just below the window line. There are five windows: one at the east end; one at the west end; and three at the south with two of these at the west separated by the church porch. The east window is of concave chamfered intersecting 'Y' tracery, creating three lights set within a chamfered pointed arch with hood mould. The west window is similar, but narrower, and of two lights. The south wall windows are identical: rectangular chamfered openings within which are three lights with cusped ogee heads. The parapet is of a coping set above a repeated c.17th-century cusped fretwork device.|$|R
5000|$|Thomas Telford {{worked as}} the County Surveyor of Shropshire between 1787 to 1834, and {{the bridge is}} {{reported}} to have once held a cast iron plate above the centre of the arch inscribed with [...] "Thomas Telford Esqr - Engineer - 1818", which is apparently visible in historic photographs, but has not been in place since at least 1985. The bridge design incorporates dressed red and grey sandstone abutments with ashlar dressings, these are slightly curved and ramped, with chamfered ashlar quoins, <b>string</b> courses, and <b>moulded</b> cornices. The structural cast-iron consists of a single segmental span with four arched lattice ribs, braced by five transverse cast-ironmembers. The road deck is formed from cast-iron metal deck plates, tarmacked over, and now finished with gravel. The original parapets have at some point been replaced with painted cast-iron railings with dograils, dogbars and shaped end balusters.|$|R
50|$|In {{and around}} the new church, five Romanesque lintels and two <b>moulded</b> <b>string</b> courses are preserved. The latter were {{originally}} in the chancel arch. Some furniture from the demolished church {{was transferred to the}} new one in 1882; this is true of the altarpiece from 1637, the pewends from 1688 and the crucifix from about the same time. Some items in use are the chalice from 1727, the altar candlesticks from 1675-1700 and the Romanesque baptismal font which corresponds exactly to the one in Beder, and also the votive ship, a frigate from c. 1750. The rest of the furniture has more recently replaced that from 1882. - A priest's sepulchral tablet from c. 1682, with a portrait painting, is a copy of a bishop's sepulchral tablet in Århus cathedral; the painting has parallels in the same place {{as well as in the}} Church of Our Lady in Århus.|$|R
500|$|The {{house is}} the {{remainder}} of a former courtyard house built for Robert Rudston circa 156775 as an extension to an earlier, pre-16th-century house. It is built of Kentish ragstone, roughly coursed on the north half of the east range and more regularly coursed on the south half of the east range and on the south range. The centre of the east range features a two-storey porch with galleted stonework on the upper level. The roof is of plain clay tiles, stone gabled {{at the north end}} of the east range but otherwise hipped, with four stone gabled dormers on the east façade and five smaller ones on the south façade. A frieze band with cornice and moulded stone base runs above the first floor windows on the east façade but is not repeated on the south, where only a <b>moulded</b> <b>string</b> course appears. Battlements were added to the eaves on both façades in 1819 as part of the third Thomas Rider's works.|$|R
