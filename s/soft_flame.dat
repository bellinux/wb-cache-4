40|$|The {{effects on}} the energy {{situation}} in industry when gas fired liquid heaters replace steam have been determined by energy surveys performed in a brewery and a slaughterhouse, measurements of the performance and emissions from liquid heaters installed in these industries, and theoretical analyses of the potential energy saving. The theoretical study {{in the first part}} of the project provides information that allows assessment of the {{effects on the}} energy situation, of part or complete conversion to decentralized heating, under the conditions prevailing in the industries concerned. The second part of the project focused on increasing the liquid heater efficiency and reducing emissions of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. Heat transfer and pressure drop for a corrugated tube were investigated experimentally. Empirical correlations for heat transfer and pressure drop were developed. These correlations were used in the design model that was developed within this project. The design model was validated against experimental data and data from an industrial application, where a section of the smooth heat exchanger tube was replaced with a corrugated tube. The results show that the design model predicts the outlet flue gas temperature and the heater efficiency quite accurately. The wall temperature at the first corrugation is also predicted with reasonable accuracy. These results make it possible to calculate the location where a corrugated tube can be inserted without causing subcooled boiling or severe fouling. It is shown that emissions of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons can be held at low levels, even when conventional industrial burners are used. The use of nozzles that produce long <b>soft</b> <b>flames</b> increases the risk for large emissions of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide...|$|R

60|$|An intense silence {{came over}} everything. Helena almost {{expected}} to hear the stars moving, everything below was so still. She {{had no idea what}} Siegmund was thinking. He lay with his arms strong around her. Then she heard the beating of his heart, like the muffled sound of salutes, she thought. It gave her the same thrill of dread and excitement, mingled with a sense of triumph. Siegmund had changed again, his mood was gone, so that he was no longer wandering in a night of thoughts, but had become different, incomprehensible to her. She had no idea what she thought or felt. All she knew was that he was strong, and was knocking urgently with his heart on her breast, like a man who wanted something and who dreaded to be sent away. How he came to be so concentratedly urgent she could not understand. It seemed an unreasonable an incomprehensible obsession to her. Yet she was glad, and she smiled in her heart, feeling triumphant and restored. Yet again, dimly, she wondered where was the Siegmund of ten minutes ago, and her heart lifted slightly with yearning, to sink with a dismay. This Siegmund was so incomprehensible. Then again, when he raised his head and found her mouth, his lips filled her with a hot flush like wine, a sweet, flaming flush of her whole body, most exquisite, as if she were nothing but a <b>soft</b> rosy <b>flame</b> of fire against him for a moment or two. That, she decided, was supreme, transcendental.|$|R
60|$|She {{came home}} in time to water her plants. She had {{performed}} this little task. The last flower attended to was a rose-tree, which bloomed in a quiet green nook {{at the back of}} the house. This plant had received the refreshing shower; she was now resting a minute. Near the wall stood a fragment of sculptured stone--a monkish relic--once, perhaps, the base of a cross. She mounted it, that she might better command the view. She had still the watering pot in one hand; with the other her pretty dress was held lightly aside, to avoid trickling drops. She gazed over the wall, along some lonely fields; beyond three dusk trees, rising side by side against the sky; beyond a solitary thorn at the head of a solitary lane far off. She surveyed the dusk moors, where bonfires were kindling. The summer evening was warm; the bell-music was joyous; the blue smoke of the fires looked <b>soft,</b> their red <b>flame</b> bright. Above them, in the sky whence the sun had vanished, twinkled a silver point--the star of love.|$|R

40|$|Trabalho completo: acesso restrito, p. 1264 – 1269 In {{the present}} paper, a {{procedure}} for preconcentration and determination of copper in <b>soft</b> drink using <b>flame</b> {{atomic absorption spectrometry}} (FAAS) is proposed, {{which is based on}} solid-phase extraction of copper(II) ions as its ion pair of 1, 10 -phenanthroline complexes with the anionic surfactant sodium dodecil sulphate (SDS), by Amberlite XAD- 2 resin. The optimization process was carried out using 24 – 1 factorial and 22 factorial with a center point designs. Four variables (XAD- 2 mass, copper mass, sample flow rate and elution flow rate) were regarded as factors in the optimization. Student's t-test on the results of the 24 – 1 factorial design with eight runs for copper extraction, demonstrated that the factors XAD- 2 mass and sample flow rate in the levels studied are statistically significant. The 22 factorial with a center point design was applied {{in order to determine the}} optimum conditions for extraction. The procedure proposed allowed the determination of copper with detection limits (3 α/S) of 3. 9 μg l− 1. The precision, calculated as relative standard deviation (R. S. D.) was 1. 8 % for 20. 0 μg l− 1 of copper. The preconcentration factor was 100. The robustness of this procedure is demonstrated by the recovery achieved for determination of copper in the presence of several cations. This procedure was applied to the determination of copper in soft drink samples collected in Campinas, SP, Brazil...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} novel {{measurement}} technique of silica microwire diameter using Brillouin backscattering process. We show that Brillouin spectra of this microwires {{give rise to}} acoustical resonances distinctive of their geometry. With {{the help of an}} efficient numerical model, the excellent agreement theory/experience allows us to determinate the diameter of the microwire with sensitivity of 10 nm. Optical microwires are very thin fiberglasses (< 1 µm) obtained by heating and stretching optical fibers used in telecommunication. Their diameter is mostly measured using difficult methods to implement (microscopy SEM, FIB), not very versatile (harmonic generation [1]), or not sensitive enough (diffraction [2]). Our measurement method is based on the Brillouin backscattering process which allow to excite different type of elastic waves (pressure, shear and surface) covering a large resonance spectrum from 5 GHz to 11 GHz [3]. Each of this resonances verify a phase-matching condition where the acoustical wave vector corresponds to twice the optical wave vector (K = 2 Kp). The decreasing of the microwire diameter get decreased the effective refractive index, and by phase-matching, shifted the elastic waves frequencies. The resulting Brillouin spectrum is then different for each diameter and it's from this relation that we developed a numerical model to predict the Brillouin spectrum {{as a function of the}} microwire geometry. Microwires was obtained from a standard fiber SMF- 28. This one is fixed on two motorized translation stages stretching the fiber at the same time the <b>flame</b> <b>soft</b> its central part. The shape of the microwire is fully controlled by the trajectories of this two stages. After stretching, the microwire keep linked to the untapered section of SMF- 28 by transitions with exponential shape which allow an efficient coupling. The microwires used here get diameters from 600 nm to 3 µm along 4 to 8 cm of length. The total losses in transmission after the pulling is only around 1. 2 dB. The measurement of Brillouin spectra is made by heterodyne detection and electrical spectral analyzer with high resolution [3]. The results show us an excellent agreement between theoretical Brillouin spectrum and experimental spectrum where resonances due to surface and longitudinal elastic waves have a very good superposition (cf. Figure 1). We can distinguish, thanks to the model, resonances due to transition part and waist part of the microwire. The lorentzian shape of resonance peaks show us also a good quality of the fabrication. The diameters determined by theoretical spectra are then confirmed by FIB measurement with a maximum difference of 5 %. The measurement sensitivity on the diameter can reach 10 nm. We developed a very efficient technique, passive, and all optical metrology of microwires. It presents a very low error compared to other technique of microscopy. Besides, it is a measurement which can be made in-situ after the stretching without any manipulation of the microwire. This technique is a new tool adapted for the design of microwire...|$|R
