5|$|Despite the one-sided {{national}} loss in 1984, Ferraro {{was still}} viewed as {{someone with a}} bright political future. Many expected her {{to run in the}} 1986 United States Senate election in New York against first-term Republican incumbent Al D'Amato, and during 1985 she did Upstate New York groundwork towards that end. A Senate candidacy had been her original plan for her career, before she was named to Mondale's ticket. But in , <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not run, due to an ongoing U.S. Justice Department probe on her and her husband's finances stemming from the 1984 campaign revelations.|$|E

She drove to a lay-by on Saddleworth Moor as she and Brady had previously arranged, and Brady went off with Bennett, supposedly looking for a lost glove.

5|$|Johansson {{played the}} cyborg, supersoldier Motoko Kusanagi in Rupert Sanders's 2017 film {{adaptation}} of the Ghost in the Shell franchise.

In March 2017, Johansson hosted Saturday Night Live for the fifth time, making her the 17th person, and the fourth woman (after Candice Bergen, Drew Barrymore, and former cast member Tina Fey) to enter the NBC sketch comedy series' prestigious Five-Timers Club.
