25|$|Prognathism, if not {{extremely}} severe, can {{be treated}} in growing patients with orthodontic functional or orthopaedic appliances. In adult patients this condition can be corrected {{by means of a}} combined surgical/orthodontic treatment, where most of the time a mandibular advancement is performed. The <b>same</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for mandibular prognathism.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1970s, the Brothers {{reached the}} apogee of their fame with the story The Porcupines' War. It was filmed and {{subsequently}} released as a TV miniseries, which was viewed by nearly everyone living in Bulgaria at the time. The <b>same</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for Vasko de Gama from Rupcha Village, another extremely successful film based on a Mormarevi screenplay, released as TV miniseries in 1986.|$|E

25|$|Early {{theories}} placed Huron {{origin in}} the St. Lawrence Valley, with some arguing for a presence near Montreal and other St. Lawrence Iroquoian peoples. Wendat is an Iroquoian language. Recent research in linguistics and archaeology confirm such a historical connection between the Huron and the St. Lawrence Iroquois, but the <b>same</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for the Erie people, {{any or all of}} the later Six Nations of the Iroquois, or the defunct Susquehannocks.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{reliable}} worldwide database listing all cave diving fatalities. Such fractional statistics as are available, however, suggest {{that very few}} divers have ever died while following accepted protocols and while using equipment configurations recognized as acceptable by the cave diving community. In the very rare cases of exceptions to this rule there have typically been unusual circumstances. Much the <b>same</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for other modes and applications of diving. There {{is little doubt that}} competence, good preparation and appropriate equipment reduce the risk of all hazardous activities.|$|E
25|$|The Marine Corps’ {{military}} operations in urban terrain doctrine recognizes that tactical success does not necessarily translate to strategic victory. It notes the Israeli’s tactical victory in Beirut was a strategic defeat—and observes the same about the Battle of Hue in the Vietnam War, when Marines defeated an enemy that sought {{to put up a}} good fight but never expected to win. Much the <b>same</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> of Fallujah’s defenders. In spite of the beating they took in November, they will continue to assert they repelled the initial attack and fought well thereafter.|$|E

25|$|Kosovo {{has been}} home to many {{important}} Albanian musicians and the <b>same</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for Macedonia. Prior to the Kosovo War, there was a thriving music industry in Kosovo, which reached new heights in recent years. The Kosovar music industry was home to many famous musicians, including the famous Nexhmije Pagarusha, Ismet Peja and the romantic, more elaborate Qamili i Vogël of Gjakova. The Macedonian band Vëllezërit Aliu became well- known for the traditional vocal duets accompanied by drum box, electric bass, synthesizer and clarinet or saxophone. Gjurmët {{is one of the}} most famous and influential 1980s rock bands from Pristina.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, {{with most}} of the former Kai Tak area still abandoned, ideas were floated to develop the area for {{commercial}} property, citing shortages of office space and rising property costs. In June 2013, the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal was opened on the tip of the former runway. Two public housing estates opened on the northeast area of the site in 2013, providing over 13,000 new rental flats. As of August 2014, the checkerboard remains visible, though with strong natural overgrowth obscuring much of its facade. The <b>same</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for much of the Kai Tak apron area. A few new buildings have been erected on the north eastern part of the apron creating the Kai Ching Estate.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the study}} of {{classics}} has not declined as fast elsewhere in Europe. In 2009, a review of Meeting the Challenge, a collection of conference papers about the teaching of Latin in Europe, noted that though there is opposition {{to the teaching of}} Latin in Italy, it is nonetheless still compulsory in most secondary schools. The <b>same</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> in the case of France or Greece, too. Indeed, Ancient Greek is one of the compulsory subjects in Greek secondary education, whereas in France, Latin is one of the optional subjects that can be chosen in a majority of middle schools and high schools. Ancient Greek is also still being taught, {{but not as much as}} Latin.|$|E
50|$|RCE {{is often}} used to help {{normalize}} the size of energy companies. Energy companies serve a number of customers that is typically different from the RCE value consumed by those customers. For example, an LDC or ESCO may serve 50,000 customers but many of those <b>can</b> <b>be</b> commercial or industrial customers, so that <b>same</b> company <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> to serve 400,000 RCE.|$|R
50|$|Like the Roman Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion {{has special}} holy days {{in honour of}} Jesus Christ, the Blessed Virgin Mary and the Apostles. Many of the parish churches in the Communion have the names Christ Church, and St. Mary the Virgin. The <b>same</b> <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for the four great patrons of Great Britain and Ireland, Saint George (England), Saint David (Wales), Saint Patrick (Ireland), and Saint Andrew (Scotland).|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, Soisalo in {{the same}} lake complex has been {{considered}} the largest island of Finland, but technically {{it is not a}} true island because the lakes surrounding it are not on the same level. The <b>same,</b> however, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> of Sääminginsalo itself as well, as it is detached from mainland by an artificial canal only and does not in this respect differ in any way from peninsulas like Jutland or Peloponnesos.|$|R
25|$|Cast threads {{in metal}} parts may be {{finished}} by machining, {{or may be}} left in the as-cast state. (The <b>same</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> of cast gear teeth.) Whether or not to bother with the additional expense of a machining operation depends on the application. For parts where the extra precision and surface finish is not strictly necessary, the machining is forgone in order to achieve a lower cost. With sand casting parts this means a rather rough finish; but with molded plastic or die-cast metal, the threads can be very nice indeed straight from the mold or die. A common example of molded plastic threads is on soda (pop) bottles. A common example of die-cast threads is on cable glands (connectors/fittings).|$|E
25|$|In essence, a {{flagship}} can {{be located}} in the market where the station's owner is headquartered, or in the largest market where that owner operates. For example, WSB-TV in Atlanta is the flagship of Cox Media Group, because Cox's headquarters is located in a suburb of that city. However, Cox owns WFXT in Boston, which is larger than Atlanta. The <b>same</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for TEGNA who lists three of its properties as its flagship stations (WXIA-TV in Atlanta, WUSA in Washington, D.C. and KUSA in Denver), but also owns WFAA in Dallas, which is larger than Atlanta, Washington D.C., and Denver in terms of Media market. Likewise, prior to merging with Gannett in 2013, WFAA served as the flagship station for Belo, as its headquarters were located in Dallas.|$|E
25|$|The {{role and}} nature of Sanskrit {{must be taken into}} {{consideration}} to understand the occurrence of consonant clusters. The orthography of written Sanskrit was completely phonetic, and had a tradition of not separating words by spaces. Morphologically it was highly synthetic, and it had a great capacity to form large compound words. Thus clustering was highly frequent, and it is Sanskrit loanwords to the Gujarati language that are the grounds of most clusters. Gujarati, on the other hand, is more analytic, has phonetically smaller, simpler words, and has a script whose orthography is slightly imperfect (a-elision) and separates words by spaces. Thus evolved Gujarati words are less a cause for clusters. The <b>same</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> of Gujarati's other longstanding source of words, Persian, which also provides phonetically smaller and simpler words.|$|E
40|$|Past {{measures}} to improve economic management have paid {{little or no}} attention to intraplant management problems. The {{result is that the}} interests generated by the new methods of management at the enterprise level have not been communicated to each structural subdivision and worker, and the measures designed to improve the management mechanism have not produced the desired results. The <b>same</b> <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>said</b> of the most recent large-scale experiment [instituted] {{at the end of the}} last five-year plan. ...|$|R
5000|$|Because Saint Michael is {{the patron}} of some North American police officers, Michaelmas {{may also be}} a Blue Mass. However, the <b>same</b> <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for members of the United States military, children, and several of St. Michael's other patronages. Lutheran Christians {{consider}} it a principal feast of Christ, and the Lutheran Confessor, Philip Melanchthon, wrote a hymn for the day that is still sung in Lutheran churches: [...] "Lord God to Thee We Give".|$|R
30|$|Are there, however, {{aspects of}} the Noko Jeans venture that can lead us towards a {{qualification}} of Lazzarato's claims? The original text is titled 'Strategies of the political entrepreneur', which suggests that political entrepreneurs are aware of this new economic formation, consciously strategising around the management of 'citizen-consumers'. Could the <b>same</b> thing <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> about Noko Jeans? Indeed, by the looks of things, the venture {{appears to be a}} well-coordinated publicity campaign, coupled with a suitably daring business plan.|$|R
25|$|However, {{what both}} Takeda {{and his son}} Tokimune says should be taken with a big pinch of salt. Famous proponents of the art {{including}} Kondo sensei and Sagawa sensei have {{been quoted as saying}} Takeda and his son had the same teaching system ie only to teach one or two people the real 'techniques' ie the aiki of the art. The rest are only taught the 'basics' or the external form of the art. As it stands, only a few were ever taught the real stuff and what the true masters of the art said or did was done to mislead a particular group of people into thinking that they were learning true aikijitsu. The <b>same</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for teachers of the modified form of daitoryu, the art of aikido.|$|E
25|$|Statistics on {{the number}} of parishes may be more {{reliable}} and consistent, even though they may not necessarily directly translate into the numbers of adherents. By number of parishes and quantity of church buildings, the UOC(MP)'s strong base is central and northernwestern Ukraine. However, percentage wise (with respect to rival Orthodox Churches) its share of parishes there varies from 60 to 70 percent. At the same time, by percentage alone (with respect to rival Orthodox Churches) the UOC(MP)'s share of church buildings peaks in the urban russophone southern and eastern Ukrainian provinces, being as high as 90%. The <b>same</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> about Transcarpathia, although there the UOC(MP)'s main rival is the Greek Catholic Church and thus its share of total church buildings is only 40%. The capital Kiev is where the greatest Orthodox rivalry takes place, with the UOC(MP) holding about half of the Orthodox communities there. The only place where the UOC(MP) is a true minority, in both quantity, percentage and support are the former Galician provinces of Western Ukraine. There the total share of parishes does not exceed more than five percent. The UOC(MP) does not have any parishes abroad, as its followers identify themselves under the same umbrella as those of the Russian Orthodox Church.|$|E

The idea for the range originated with the firm's marketing director, Dilys Day, who explained: [...] "I was brought up on hotpot and Coronation Street. So when I joined Holland's a year ago, it seemed right to put the two together with Betty's hotpot." [...] Day added that: [...] "We are all very excited about Betty's Kitchen products.

500|$|It must be emphasized, however, that {{an entity}} {{is not merely}} a sum of its relations, but also a {{valuation}} of them and reaction to them. [...] For Whitehead, creativity is the absolute principle of existence, and every entity (whether it is a human being, a tree, or an electron) has some degree of novelty in how it responds to other entities, and is not fully determined by causal or mechanistic laws. [...] Of course, most entities do not have consciousness. [...] As a human being's actions cannot always be predicted, the <b>same</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> of where a tree's roots will grow, or how an electron will move, or whether it will rain tomorrow. [...] Moreover, inability to predict an electron's movement (for instance) is not due to faulty understanding or inadequate technology; rather, the fundamental creativity/freedom of all entities means that there will always remain phenomena that are unpredictable.|$|E
500|$|From a {{technical}} and tactical point of view, the D-1 project provided the Red Army (RKKA) corps artillery with a modern 152mm howitzer, which combined both good mobility and firepower. When {{compared with a}} typical contemporary howitzer of similar caliber, the D-1 had shorter range, but was much lighter. For example, the German 15 cm sFH 18 had a range of 13,325 meters - about one kilometer longer {{than that of the}} D-1 - but also weighed almost two tons more (5,510 kilograms in traveling position). The <b>same</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> of the US 155-mm howitzer M1 (14,600 meters, 5,800 kilograms) or the 149mm howitzer manufactured by the Italian Ansaldo (14,250 meters, 5,500 kilograms). A German howitzer with characteristics {{similar to those of the}} D-1 [...] the 15 cm sFH 36 [...] did not reach mass production. Compared with older pieces such as the French Schneider model 1917 (11,200 meters, 4,300kg), the D-1 had the advantage in both weight and range.|$|E
