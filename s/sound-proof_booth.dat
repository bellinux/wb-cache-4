It is provided particularly for live television coverages such as press conferences, live or taped interviews with political figures, musicians, artists, sportsmen or people from the business circle. In this type of interpreting, the interpreter has {{to sit in a}} <b>sound-proof</b> <b>booth</b> where ideally he/she can see the speakers on a monitor and the set. All equipment should be checked before recording begins. In particular, satellite connections have to be double-checked to ensure that the interpreter's voice is not sent back and the interpreter gets to hear only one channel at a time. In the case of interviews recorded outside the studio and some current affairs program, the interpreter interprets what he or she hears on a TV monitor. Background noise can be a serious problem. The interpreter working for the media has to sound as slick and confident as a television presenter.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAircraft {{interior}} noise {{is a major}} design stake with respect to airline requirements for passenger and crew comfort. The focus was put here on cockpit noise. The goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate unpleasantness of such sounds and to propose metrics for its prediction. Six sounds recorded in various airplanes were used; one of them was modified in order to reduce the level of an emerging low-frequency component, leading to a number of seven stimuli. These stimuli were used in a pair-comparison experiment in a <b>sound-proof</b> <b>booth.</b> 31 listeners participated to the experiment. Results could be analysed using a BTL model, which provided an unpleasantness scaling of the stimuli. Unpleasantness was clearly related to loudness; due to the high level in the very low frequency bands, A-weighted level failed to represent loudness. Two loudness models were also used: the ISO- 532 one and the ANSI S 3. 4 one. It appeared that the former gave better results. It is argued that this is due to the evolution of loudness values in the low frequency range, which is different between these two models...|$|E
30|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} the proposed hiding technique, we conducted several simulations using NOIZEUS database [25 – 27]. This corpus contains 30 sentences from the IEEE sentence database, recorded in a <b>sound-proof</b> <b>booth</b> using Tucker Davis Technologies recording equipment. The sentences are produced by three male and female speakers. The 30 sentences: 15 male and 15 female speakers include all phonemes in the American English language. The sentences were originally sampled at 25 kHz and down-sampled to 8 kHz. The length of the speech file varies between 0.02 and 0.03 ms. In the comparative evaluation, we conducted four sets of tests. In the first set of simulations, we embedded each of the 15 male speech files in each of the 15 female speech files. In the second set of tests, we hide each of the 15 female speech files in each of the 15 male speech files. In the third set of tests, we embedded each of the 15 male speech signals in the remaining 14 male speech files. In the last sets of tests, we hide each of the 15 female speech segments in the remaining same gender speech files. Each set is iterated for five different wavelet families (Haar, Daubechies, Symlets, Coiflets, and BiorSplines). In total, we conducted 4, 210 computer simulations ((15 * 15 * 2 [*]+[*] 14 * 14 * 2)* 5).|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{quantify}} the vocal tract (VT) lumen of older children with Down syndrome using acoustic reflection (AR) technology. Design: Comparative study. Setting: Vocal tract lab with <b>sound-proof</b> <b>booth.</b> Participants: Ten children (4 males and 6 females), aged 9 - 17 years old diagnosed with Down syndrome. Ten typically developing children (4 males and 6 females) matched for age, gender, and race. Intervention: Each participant's vocal tract measurements {{were obtained by}} using an Eccovision Acoustic Pharyngometer. Main outcome measures: Six vocal tract dimensional parameters (oral length, oral volume, pharyngeal length, pharyngeal volume, total vocal tract length, and total vocal tract volume) from children with Down syndrome and the typically developing children were measured and compared. Results: Children with Down syndrome exhibited small oral cavities when compared to control group (F(1, 18) = 6. 55, p = 0. 02). They also demonstrated a smaller vocal tract volumes (F(1, 18) = 2. 58, p = 0. 13), although the results {{were not statistically significant}} at the 0. 05 level. Pharyngeal length, pharyngeal volume, and vocal tract length were not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusion: Children with Down syndrome had smaller oral cavities, and smaller vocal tract volumes. No significant differences were found for pharyngeal length, pharyngeal volume, and vocal tract length between these two groups. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved. postprin...|$|E
40|$|Besides the gold standard {{pure-tone}} audiometry, it {{is highly}} relevant to assess a persons supra-threshold speech perception skills, especially in background noise, as it approaches our functional hearing ability in a daily communicative environment. In case of a sensorineural hearing loss, an impairment leading to both the attenuation and distortion of incoming sounds, speech perception problems are highly likely to arise. A relationship thus exists between the speech reception threshold (SRT) in noise and the pure-tone thresholds (PTT), although not perfect. The main influencing factors are (1) individual differences in (peripheral or central) supra-threshold versus threshold auditory processing, (2) cognitive and linguistic skills, (3) the redundancy in speech samples, and (4) the measurement error on both behavioral measures. In this PhD project, it was investigated how different types of speech and noise material may influence the SRT-PTT relationship and may lead to new possibilities, new applications of a speech-in-noise test for efficient and sensitive hearing assessment. In {{the first part of}} this PhD thesis, including the first three studies, the efficiency and sensitivity for screening purposes was investigated. Both for detecting age-related hearing loss, which is slowly progressing and often undiagnosed, and for noise-induced hearing loss, where periodic screening in high-risk populations may prevent further damage, there is a need for a robust, simple, fast, and sensitive hearing screening technique. When conducting a supra-threshold speech-in-noise test, neither a <b>sound-proof</b> <b>booth</b> nor a high-quality, well-calibrated audiometer are requisite, and it can be implemented as a quick, automated self-test. This makes a speech-in-noise test highly suitable for screening purposes. Smits et al (2004) were the first to develop their Dutch Digit Triplet speech-in-noise self-screening test through home telephone. In the first study, a Digit Triplet test was developed in French, for both telephone and broadband headphone presentation. Due to the separate optimization of the speech material based on the intelligibility of the individual digits, a steep psychometric curve (17 and 27 %/dB, respectively) and a low measurement error on the SRT (0. 7 and 0. 6 dB, respectively) were achieved for both versions. Furthermore, the telephone version was validated in hearing-impaired listeners and yielded a strong correlation of 0. 77 with the pure-tone average at 0. 5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz (PTA 0. 5, 1, 2, 4). With 20 000 calls within one month after the nationwide release in France, the test also proves to fulfill the need for an easily accessible hearing screening test. In the second study, the sensitivity of the broadband Digit Triplet test for detecting (early-stage) high-frequency hearing loss was investigated in a group of 118 noise-exposed workers. The 84 Dutch-speaking participants showed a very strong linear relation between the SRT and PTA 2, 3, 4, 6 (R= 0. 86). The sensitivity and specificity to detect mild high-frequency hearing loss were 92 % and 89 %, respectively. The results of the 34 French-speaking participants showed a highly similar trend. Third, it was explored if a further improvement could be achieved by changing the speech items of the test (9 consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC-) words all with the same vowel) and/or by using a low-pass (LP) filtered version of the standard speech-shaped noise. Within the same group of noise-exposed listeners, the CVC test showed a higher measurement error and a lower between-subject variation than the Digit Triplet test, leading to a lower sensitivity. The CVC test in LP-noise, on the other hand, yielded a sensitivity improvement due to the large increase in between-subject spread. However, there was no improvement compared with the original Digit Triplet test. In the second part, three types of speech-in-noise tests, all developed with a different purpose, were compared to each other: a common everyday sentence test, a closed-set sentence test (Matrix), and the Digit Triplet test. Forty-nine normal-hearing and 69 mildly-to-moderately hearing-impaired listeners, recruited from four French-speaking regions in Belgium and France, participated. No regional effects on any of the three types were found. Mutual correlations between the three tests were high (R> 0. 81). The Digit Triplet and Matrix test, both with a low contextual redundancy, showed the highest discriminative power, especially between the normal-hearing and mildly hearing-impaired listeners. nrpages: 188 status: publishe...|$|E
