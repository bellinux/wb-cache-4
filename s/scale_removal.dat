Two-step chemical cleanings with alkaline and acidic agents are typically applied to restore the treatment capacity. In this study, the feasibility of one-step cleaning using free nitrous acid (FNA) was investigated as a novel low cost cleaning agent. The FNA cleaning solution was prepared by acidiﬁcation of a sodium nitrite solution with hydrochloric acid. Seven fouled RO membranes collected from full-scale wastewater recycling and desalination plants were used to perform lab-scale cleaning trials. Membrane fouling characterisation revealed six of out of seven membranes were mainly bio-fouled, while one membrane was severely fouled by calcium carbonate. This study showed the feasibility of using FNA at pH 3. 0 for biomass removal as well as for calcium carbonate <b>scaling</b> <b>removal.</b> The results from the lab-scale cleaning tests suggested that FNA {{can be used as a}} single cleaning agent for both biofouling and <b>scaling</b> <b>removal.</b> Cost analysis showed that FNA is a cost-effective solution for biofouling and <b>scaling</b> <b>removal</b> in RO ﬁltration applications...|$|R

At the 47 th day of lab experiment, highest root initiation was from chilling treatment. Same result was also obtained for shoot initiation.

This decoupling of scales may be largely due to sampling processes (the increasing constraint imposed by sampling fewer individuals at fine scales), as distinct from ecological processes, such as environmental heterogeneity, that operate across <b>scales.</b> <b>Removal</b> of the sampling constraint from fine-scale richness estimates should yield species-area curves that behave {{like those of the}} regions in which they are embedded, but an effective method for this removal has not been available. We suggest an approach that incorporates the manner in which small areas accumulate species over time as a way to remove the signature of sampling processes from fine-scale species-area curves. We report for three species-rich grasslands from two continents how local plant species richness is distributed through time at multiple, nested spatial scales, and we ask whether sampling-corrected curves reflect the spatial scaling of richness of each larger floristic province.

40|$|Abstract: The {{quality of}} {{freshwater}} {{at any point}} on the landscape reflects the combined effects of many processes along water pathways. Human activities on all spatial scales affect both water quality and quantity. Alteration of the landscape and associated vegetation has not only changed the water balance, but typically has altered processes that control water quality. Effects of human activities {{on a small scale}} are relevant to an entire drainage basin. Furthermore, local, regional, and global differences in climate and water flow are considerable, causing varying effects of human activities on land and water quality and quantity, depending on location within a watershed, geology, biology, physiographic characteristics, and climate. These natural characteristics also greatly control human activities, which will, in turn, modify (or affect) the natural composition of water. One of the most important issues for effective resource management is recognition of cyclical and cascading effects of human activities on the water quality and quantity along hydrologic pathways. The degradation of water quality in one part of a watershed can have negative effects on users downstream. Everyone lives downstream of the effects of some human activity. An extremely important factor is that substances added to the atmosphere, land, and water generally have relatively long time <b>scales</b> for <b>removal</b> or clean up. The nature of the substance, including its affinity for adhering to soil and its ability to be transformed, affects the mobility and the time <b>scale</b> for <b>removal</b> of the substance. Policy alone will not solve many of the degradation issues, but a combination of policy, education, scientific knowledge, planning, and enforcement of applicable laws can provide mechanisms for slowing the rate of degradation and provide human and environmental protection.

As these systems grow in size, it becomes increasingly difficult to control and monitor them using a client-server-like architecture. Introducing decentralization and autonomy in these systems {{seems to be the}} obvious solution. Autonomy has several advantages. These include easy <b>scaling,</b> <b>removal</b> of single points of failure, cost-effective deployment and greater promotes collaborative environments. However, autonomous systems present certain challenges as well. The absence of server- like nodes make it difficult to locate and manage available resources, schedule tasks efficiently across them, assure security and develop applications that can make use of these powerful platforms. This dissertation addresses some of these issues. We present autonomous techniques for resource location, task scheduling and programmability in large scale computing systems. Our work tries to answer the question 'Do autonomous solutions of these issues achieve same (or comparable) performance benefits as their centralized counterparts?' We propose GUARD, a protocol for locating computing resources in a completely autonomous environment. GUARD can locate resources matching single or multiple parameters and it provides a trade off between efficiency and probability of success. We then discuss A-FAST, a decentralized scheduling technique for homogeneous independent tasks, that uses the notion of pressure from fluid networks to autonomously guide tasks to resources. Simulations show A- FAST to achieve a high level of efficiency (≈ 98 % of optimal steady state throughput) for both computation and communication dominated tasks. The dissertation also discusses a programming platform that we designed and implemented to allow the development of applications for decentralized environments. Our platform allows programmers to develop code without having knowledge of the underlying system and allows platform-specific information to be fed to the program at runtime. We show how this platform can be used to generate code that adapts to several situations without changing the original program or involving the programmer in the scheduling decision...|$|R
