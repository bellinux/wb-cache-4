The hydrogen activation is considered the rate determining step for the overall hydrodesulfurization (HDS) reaction. Understanding the hydrogen activation thermodynamically is important to determine the energy required for the hydrogen activation on the Co 9 S 8 /MoS 2 catalyst interface. The <b>stacking</b> <b>height</b> dependency and catalytic activity on the catalyst sites were found by calculating the transition states and energy of barrier for the hydrogen activation via linear synchronous transit and quadratic synchronous transit (LST/QST) methods integrated in a density functional theory (DFT) program such as DMol(3). This study showed that catalytic activity was dependent on the <b>stacking</b> <b>height</b> revealing that the Co 9 S 8 /MoS 2 structure at the (Mo, Mo) site was the most efficient catalytically structure requiring less energy for the hydrogen activation.

The pyrolysis and activation reactions increased the BET areas (m 2 /g carbon) of the acid-washed samples almost 10 -fold. The {{increase of the}} BET areas (m 2 /g carbon) by increasing the temperature of pyrolysis or activation from 700 C to 1000 C was explained with the burn-out of carbon {{which led to the}} development of porosity. The values of the <b>stacking</b> <b>heights,</b> Lc of HCl/HF-washed samples seemed to increase from 1. 0 nm to 1. 5 nm, the average number of graphene sheets increased from 2. 8 to 4. 4, and the lateral size of the crystallites, La, increased very faintly from 5. 0 nm to 5. 5 nm when the pyrolysis temperature was increased from 700 C to 1000 C. Activation reactions performed at the same temperature range did not change the <b>stacking</b> <b>heights.</b> The values of Lc for activated HCl/HF-washed samples stayed almost constant in the same range as for the carbonized samples within 1. 0 - 1. 5 nm.

50|$|In the {{threadless}} headset system, the spacers {{are important}} in placing the stem and preload bolt in the correct position on the steerer tube. Thus the <b>stack</b> <b>height</b> of the stem becomes important. The steerer tube of the fork must be cut to length such that it leaves at least enough of the steerer tube protruding above the headset for the stem to clamp on to; if the steerer tube is cut longer than the stem, then spacers are used {{to fill the gap}} between the stem and the conical compression washer. Bicycle racers seeking the greatest saddle-to-handlebar drop for better aerodynamics will often forego spacers and cut the steerer tube down to exactly match the headset bearing cup <b>stack</b> <b>height</b> plus the stem height.|$|E
50|$|Cutting the steerer tube to its {{minimum length}} {{prevents}} {{switching to a}} taller stem or to a headset cups with a higher <b>stack</b> <b>height.</b> Any increase in handlebar height after this cut requires purchasing a new fork, a stem with more angular rise (some stems can be turned over for greater height), or a special adapter that clamps onto the steerer tube and gives a higher clamping position for the original stem. In addition, many riders who may have less flexibility than a seasoned racer may wish to gain more height on the handlebars, reducing the saddle-to-handlebar drop and providing a more upright and comfortable riding position. If an owner simply wishes to replace the headset with one having a slightly larger <b>stack</b> <b>height,</b> {{it may be possible}} for a bike shop or framebuilder to mill or re-face the head tube to gain an extra 1-2mm of <b>stack</b> <b>height</b> without having to replace the fork. Many threadless fork steerer tubes are cut longer than necessary to allow for adjustments and the steerer tube above the stem is stacked with spacers that can be moved above or below the stem to fine-tune the handlebar height. Often these spacers are aluminum or carbon fiber, but titanium spacers are also available.|$|E

We {{define the}} notion of height-deterministic pushdown au-tomata, a model where for any given input string the <b>stack</b> <b>heights</b> dur-ing any (nondeterministic) {{computation}} on the input are a priori fixed. Different subclasses of height-deterministic pushdown automata, strictly containing the class of regular languages and still closed under boolean language operations, are considered.

Here, we suggest a natural and intuitive model that subsumes all the formalisms proposed so far by employing height-deterministic pushdown automata. Decidability and complexity questions are also considered. ...|$|R
