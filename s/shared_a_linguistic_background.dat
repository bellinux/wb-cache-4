40|$|Literacy is an {{important}} phenomenon in all societies today. Nations around the world put in {{a great deal of}} effort and allocate a lot of funding for educational purposes to improve literacy rates of children and to help them to become literate citizens so that they can function better in society. Studies of teacher education in the United States have shown that many of the in-service teachers lack the basic foundation of linguistic constructs needed to improve literacy skills in elementary classrooms. Further, {{it has been shown that}} students who were taught by teachers with <b>a</b> <b>linguistic</b> <b>background</b> performed better on reading, writing, and spelling skills than those children who were taught by teachers without such <b>a</b> <b>linguistic</b> <b>background.</b> These studies have recommended better teacher training programs that incorporate classes to specifically teach linguistic constructs. However, there are various factors that may affect literacy development in school children, such as family background and number of books available at home. The majority of these studies have been conducted in the United States and what is true for the U. S. may not be true for other countries. The purpose of this study is to examine the linguistic knowledge of elementary classroom teachers and how it impacts children?s achievement in literacy skills in the North West region of Cameroon where English is the predominant language of instruction in schools. Data were collected from 100 primary school teachers and 200 third grade children from the rural and urban regions, then analyzed using independent t-tests at a 0. 05 level of significance. Overall the teachers exemplified <b>a</b> lack of <b>linguistic</b> knowledge; however, when comparing rural to urban, the urban teacher?s linguistic knowledge was significantly higher. Similarly, the children?s results also revealed a higher performance rate from the urban children. Based on the results it is recommended that teacher preparatory programs should foster content and pedagogic expertise and include essential features in literacy instruction. The quality of teachers teaching in the primary schools is important and the Ministry of National Education in Cameroon should ensure a better teacher education program that can prepare confident and knowledgeable teachers...|$|R

The examiner started each interview with a participant signing a Free and Informed Consent Form, followed by a Screening Questionnaire and <b>a</b> <b>Linguistic</b> <b>Background</b> Questionnaire (Zimmer and Bonini 2008), to be answered orally, question by question. The former questionnaire contained questions about personal information such as handedness, level of education, history of health problems and medicine use.

The latter contained questions about their social life, professional activity, the languages spoken, as well as travelling and intercultural experience. Questions regarding the age and context of acquisition of their L 2 /L 3, and the amount and frequency of use of their language(s) regarding speaking, reading and writing allowed us to classify the participants as monolinguals or bi/multilinguals.

40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} how {{factors such as}} cross-linguistic {{transfer}} affect the degree of attainment of one morphosyntax-pragmatic interface phenomenon in particular: the subjunctive in French and Spanish in contexts where mood can alternate without ungrammaticality. According to Quer (1998), such contexts present variation amongst native speakers (NSs). In order to identify the external and internal factors that govern this variation, we asked our control groups, 43 NSs of French and 22 NSs of Spanish, to fill out <b>a</b> <b>linguistic</b> profile and <b>a</b> scenario selection task. 36 L 1 English speakers completed these same tasks in addition to <b>a</b> <b>linguistic</b> <b>background</b> questionnaire. 23 of these participants were students of French and 13 were students of Spanish. 15 of the students of French {{had no knowledge of}} Spanish whereas 8 did.

The results from our scenario selection task suggest that positive cross-linguistic influence occurs both {{from the direction of the}} L 2 to the L 3 and from the L 3 to the L 2 since the multilingual learners outperformed the bilingual learners, most likely due to their increased exposure to the subjunctive in more than one non native tongue. Such results also suggest that adult L 2 learners are better able to acquire an interface phenomenon when they are also learning an L 3 which uses it in the same way, because they are able to advantageously apply their knowledge of this concept in French to Spanish, and vice-versa...|$|R

Before labeling, our classification system was explained using 100 examples with answers during a 1 -h training course. Annotators were allowed to keep their 100 training examples (not part of the testing data) as references during the experiment. Each annotator was to label both middle-level types and fine-grained subclasses for 100 discourse relations extracted from HIT-CDTB and 100 serial verb relations extracted from Sinica Treebank, {{and at the same}} time reveal whether each tag of their selection was based on the decision tree or the connective markers. Since the annotators are tested for the agreement of relation identification, they are told which verb-pair is the analyzed target. The analyzed verb-pair must be on the same parsing level, i.e., the nested structure is not taken into account since verbs occur in nested structure are not regarded as CPCs.

40|$|This study aims {{to deepen}} our {{understanding}} of the expression of gender in heritage speakers of Arabic by distinguishing gender assignment from gender agreement with lexical borrowings. Studies on the assignment of gender to lexical borrowings (Mustafawi, 2002; Moshref, 2010; AL-Saidat, 2011) in monolingual Arabic speakers have shown that speakers rely on (morpho) -phonological endings. That is, lexical items ending in [-a] are to be assigned the feminine gender, while lexical borrowings that lack the [-a] ending are assigned the masculine gender. Here, we investigate gender assignment to lexical borrowings by Arabic heritage speakers to find out whether this group assigns gender using the mechanisms used by monolingually raised speakers, and to detect any patterns that heritage speakers follow when assigning gender to loanwords. The instrument we used consisted of <b>a</b> <b>linguistic</b> <b>background</b> questionnaire, <b>an</b> oral production task, a grammaticality judgment task, a gender assignment task, and a translation task. Results from 23 participants (15 heritage speakers) suggest a strong tendency by heritage speakers towards assigning loanwords to the masculine gender, especially {{in the absence of the}} [-a] ending, which supports the hypothesis that regards the masculine gender as the unmarked or the default gender (Greenberg, 1966; Albirini, Benmamoun 2 ̆ 6 Saadah, 2011; Albirini, Benmamoun 2 ̆ 6 Chakrani, 2013).

The application process is fraught with confusion and difficulties and I would like to invite discussion and feedback from the audience. There are three issues that I am particularly concerned about, namely, 1) cooperation with commercial companies; 2) protection of vulnerable subjects; 3) preserving disciplinary identity in interdisciplinaryresearch. A problem underlying collaborative projects involving commercial companies is the potential risk of being interpreted as helping companies to attract consumers.

Part of my research involves interviews with companies providing genetic services to the general public, and I am not clear about whether a company should be treated as an institution or as a human participant who requires informed consent. Another important concern in my research is the treatment of vulnerable subjects including pregnant women and individuals who are at increased risk of developing genetic-related health conditions.
