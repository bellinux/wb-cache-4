5|$|Lucas v. Earl is {{a leading}} case {{in the area of}} U.S. income taxation, and stands for the Anticipatory Assignment of Income Doctrine. In the case, Mr. Earl was arguing that because he and his wife, in the year 1901, had made a legally valid {{assignment}} agreement (for state law purposes) to have his then-current and after-acquired income (which was earned solely by him) be treated as the income of both him and his wife as joint tenants with right of <b>survivorship,</b> the assignment agreement should also determine the federal income tax effect of the income he earned (i.e., only half the income should be taxed to him).|$|E
5|$|The Hadza {{people of}} Tanzania also share food, {{possibly}} to gain in reputation. Hunters cannot be sharing meat mainly to provision their families or to gain reciprocal benefits, as teenage boys often give away their meat {{even though they}} do not yet have wives or children, so costly signalling of their qualities is the likely explanation. These qualities include good eyesight, coordination, strength, knowledge, endurance, or bravery. Hadza hunters more often pair with highly fertile, hard-working wives than non-hunters. A woman benefits from mating with a man who possesses such qualities as her children will most likely inherit qualities that increase fitness and <b>survivorship.</b> She may also benefit from her husband’s high social status. Thus, hunting is an honest and costly signal of phenotypic quality.|$|E
25|$|The first life {{insurance}} policies {{were taken out}} in the early 18th century. The first company to offer {{life insurance}} was the Amicable Society for a Perpetual Assurance Office, founded in London in 1706 by William Talbot and Sir Thomas Allen.

25|$|Another {{strength}} of P. dominula {{in terms of}} <b>survivorship</b> is their ability to suffer less nest predation than other Polistes. P. dominula is a less attractive prey for birds mainly due to its aposematic coloration and the relatively strong attachment of the comb to the substrate – typically tree branches or man-made structures. Unlike P. fuscatus, which is colored brown with a few faint, thin, yellow stripes, P. dominula is colored bright yellow with alternating black, similar to the warning coloration of Vespula germanica, a common and aggressive yellowjacket. In addition to their alerting coloration, P. dominula comb strength also contributes to their higher chance of <b>survivorship.</b> P. dominula might have an advantage over P. fuscatus against avian predators because their combs {{are less likely to}} be dislodged from the substrate by birds because the side force required to dislodge it is greater for P. dominula than for P. fuscatus combs.|$|E
25|$|The <b>survivorship</b> and {{relative}} fitness of mosquitoes are not {{adversely affected by}} Plasmodium infection, which indicates the importance of vector fitness in shaping the evolution of Plasmodium. Plasmodium has evolved the capability to manipulate mosquito feeding behavior. Mosquitoes harboring Plasmodium have a higher propensity to bite than uninfected mosquitoes. This tendency has facilitated the spread of Plasmodium to the various hosts.|$|E
25|$|The short lifetimes of many {{hedge funds}} {{means that there}} are many new {{entrants}} and many departures each year, which raises the problem of <b>survivorship</b> bias. If we examine only funds that have survived to the present, we will overestimate past returns because many of the worst-performing funds have not survived, and the observed association between fund youth and fund performance suggests that this bias may be substantial.|$|E
25|$|Fungi {{have been}} found to have a {{protective}} role for plants rooted in soils with high metal concentrations, such as acidic and contaminated soils. Pine trees inoculated with Pisolithus tinctorius planted in several contaminated sites displayed high tolerance to the prevailing contaminant, <b>survivorship</b> and growth. One study discovered the existence of Suillus luteus strains with varying tolerance of zinc. Another study discovered that zinc-tolerant strains of Suillus bovinus conferred resistance to plants of Pinus sylvestris. This was probably due to binding of the metal to the extramatricial mycelium of the fungus, without affecting the exchange of beneficial substances.|$|E
25|$|An oft-cited {{academic}} paper (Kaplan and Schoar, 2005) {{suggests that}} the net-of-fees returns to PE funds are roughly comparable to the S 500 (or even slightly under). This analysis may actually overstate the returns because it relies on voluntarily reported data and hence suffers from <b>survivorship</b> bias (i.e. funds that fail won't report data). One should also note that these returns are not risk-adjusted. A more recent paper (Harris, Jenkinson and Kaplan, 2012) found that average buyout fund returns in the U.S. have actually exceeded that of public markets. These findings were supported by earlier work, using a different data set (Robinson and Sensoy, 2011).|$|E
25|$|Some {{critics say}} that breast cancer {{awareness}} has transformed the disease into a market-driven industry of <b>survivorship</b> and corporate sales pitches. Corporate marketing machines promote early detection of breast cancer, while also opposing public health efforts, such as stricter environmental legislation, that might decrease the incidence rate of breast cancer. These critics believe {{that some of the}} breast cancer organizations, particularly the highly visible Susan G. Komen for the Cure, have become captive companies that support and provide social capital to the breast cancer industry, including pharmaceutical companies, mammography equipment manufacturers, and pollution-causing industries, as well as large corporations, creating or exacerbating other problems.|$|E
25|$|Two common {{environments that}} tend to favor neoteny are high-altitude and cool environments because neotenous {{individuals}} have a higher fitness than those that metamorphose into the adult form. This is because the energy required for metamorphosis is too costly for the individual’s fitness, also the conditions favor neoteny due {{to the ability of}} neotenous individuals to utilize the available resources more easily. This trend {{can be seen in the}} comparison of salamander species of lower and higher altitudes. The neotenous individuals have higher <b>survivorship</b> as well as higher fecundity than the salamanders that had gone to the adult form in the higher altitude and cooler environment. Insects in cooler environments tend to show neoteny in flight because wings have a high surface area and lose heat quickly, thus it is not advantageous for insects in that environment to metamorphose into adults.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of grants of representation, each one designed to cover a particular circumstance. The most common cover the two most common situations—either the deceased died leaving a valid will or they did not. If someone left a valid will, it is more than likely that the grant is a grant of probate. If there was no will, the grant required {{is likely to be a}} grant of administration. There are many other grants that can be required in certain circumstances, and many have technical Latin names, but the general public is most likely to encounter grants of probate or administration. If an estate has a value of less than £5,000.00 or if all assets are held jointly and therefore pass by <b>survivorship,</b> for example to a surviving spouse, a grant is not usually required.|$|E
25|$|Some male {{behaviors}} {{that may have}} led to polyandry are displacement, where a male is gripped onto and mating with a female, another male may make an effort to mate as well and displace the male that was originally copulating; forced copulation, where there is a high density of aggressive males, and female abandonment, where a female but spots a better one to mate with and abandons the less favorable one. This can lead to sequential polyandry if the male leaves before the entire clutch is released and an additional male fertilizes these eggs as well. In Bibron's toadlet (Pseudophryne bibronii) females spread out their eggs across the nests of two to eight males, with those who exhibited higher levels of polyandrous behavior having higher mean offspring <b>survivorship,</b> showing that insurance against nest failure and dispersal of mortality risk is related to the evolution of polyandry.|$|E
25|$|Once {{maturity}} is reached, {{the chance}} of death seems not to increase with age. The <b>survivorship</b> curve of box turtles is therefore probably {{similar to that of}} other long-living turtles. The average life span of adult box turtles is 50 years, while a significant portion lives over 100 years. The age of a growing box turtle in the wild can not be accurately estimated by counting the growth rings on the scutes; Their growth is directly affected by the amount of food, types of food, water, illness, and so much more. Box turtle eggs are flexible, oblong and are (depending on the taxon) on average 2–4cm long weighing 5-11 g. The normal clutch size is 1-7 eggs. In captivity and in the southern end of their range, box turtles can have more than one clutch per year, while the average clutch size is larger in more northern populations.|$|E
25|$|In {{social welfare}} programs, the Office of the Chief Actuary (OCACT), Social Security Administration plans and directs {{a program of}} actuarial {{estimates}} and analyses relating to SSA-administered retirement, survivors and disability insurance programs and to proposed changes in those programs. It evaluates operations of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, conducts studies of program financing, performs actuarial and demographic research on social insurance and related program issues involving mortality, morbidity, utilization, retirement, disability, <b>survivorship,</b> marriage, unemployment, poverty, old age, families with children, etc., and projects future workloads. In addition, the Office is charged with conducting cost analyses relating to the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, a general-revenue financed, means-tested program for low-income aged, blind and disabled people. The Office provides technical and consultative services to the Commissioner, to the Board of Trustees of the Social Security Trust Funds, and its staff appears before Congressional Committees to provide expert testimony on the actuarial aspects of Social Security issues.|$|E
25|$|Apparent {{competition}} {{occurs in}} populations that are predated upon. An increase in {{population of the}} prey species will bring more predators to the area, which {{increases the risk of}} an individual being eaten and hence lowers its <b>survivorship.</b> Like exploitative competition, the individuals aren’t interacting directly but rather suffer a reduction in fitness {{as a consequence of the}} increasing population size. Apparent competition is generally associated with inter rather than intraspecific competition, whereby two different species share a common predator. An adaptation that makes one species less likely to be eaten results in a reduction in fitness for the other prey species because the predator species hunts more intensely as food has become more difficult to obtain. For example, native skinks (Oligosoma) in New Zealand suffered a large decline in population after the introduction of rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). Both species are eaten by ferrets (Mustela furo) so the introduction of rabbits resulted in immigration of ferrets to the area, which then depleted skink numbers.|$|E
25|$|The {{adaptive}} foraging {{hypothesis is}} a proposed pre-copulatory explanation in which females assess the nutritional {{value of a}} male compared to the male's value as a mate. Starving females are usually in poor physical condition {{and are therefore more}} likely to cannibalize a male than to mate with him. Among mantises, cannibalism by female Pseudomantis albofimriata improves fecundity, overall growth, and body condition. Among spiders, Dolomedes triton females in need of additional energy and nutrients for egg development choose to consume the closest nutritional source, even if this means cannibalizing a potential mate. In Agelenopsis pennsylvanica and Lycosa tarantula, a significant increase in fecundity, egg case size, hatching success, and <b>survivorship</b> of offspring has been observed when hungry females choose to cannibalize smaller males before copulating with larger, genetically superior males. This reproductive success was largely due to the increased energy uptake by cannibalizing males and investing that additional energy in the development of larger, higher-quality egg cases. In D. triton, post-copulatory sexual cannibalism was observed in the females that had a limited food source; these females copulated with the males and then cannibalized them.|$|E
25|$|Most amphipods are detritivores or scavengers, {{with some}} being grazers of algae, omnivores or predators of small insects and crustaceans. Food is grasped {{with the front}} two pairs of legs, which are armed with large claws. More {{immobile}} species of amphipods eat higher quantities of less nutritious food rather than actively seeking more nutritious food. This {{is a type of}} compensatory feeding. This behaviour may have evolved to minimise predation risk when searching for other foods. Ampithoe longimana, for example, is more sedentary than other species and have been observed to remain on host plants longer. In fact, when presented with both high- and low-nutrition food options, the sedentary species Ampithoe longimana does not distinguish between the two options. Other amphipod species, such as Gammarus mucronatus and Elasmopus levis, which have superior predator avoidance and are more mobile, are better able to pursue different food sources. In species without the compensatory feeding ability, <b>survivorship,</b> fertility, and growth can be strongly negatively affected in the absence of high-quality food. Compensatory feeding may also explain the year-round presence of A.longimana in certain waters. Because algal presence changes throughout the year in certain communities, the evolution of flexible feeding techniques such as compensatory feeding may have been beneficial to survival.|$|E
25|$|Colony-level {{inhibitory}} {{strategies can}} also create 'organizational immunity'. For example, social insect workers tend to work initially at {{the centre of}} the nest, nursing the brood, and as they age adopt tasks {{closer and closer to the}} periphery, e.g., foraging. This compartmentalization, termed centrifugal polyethism, means that workers of the same age interact mainly with others of the same age, who are performing the same task in the same spatial compartment: thus if a new disease arises that is transmitted through physical worker-worker contact it is limited to one section of the colony. The spatial structuring of western honey bee colonies (Apis mellifera) privileges young individuals-when colonies are afflicted with diseases that have a short infectious period (the time period during which infected individuals can transmit the disease to susceptible individuals), it is confined only to the older individuals closer to the outside. In the common eastern bumblebee (Bombus impatiens), workers who feed larvae tend to remain near {{the centre of the}} nest even when not performing this activity, and the converse is true for workers who forage; 11–13% of workers remain in small zones a particular distance from the nest centre throughout their life. The demographic distribution of a colony can also can be utilized for antiparasite purposes: work on Z. angusticollis has shown that not only are there differences to parasite susceptibility between instars but that the demographic constitution of a group significantly affects <b>survivorship</b> (mixed age groups do better than single-age groups). The effect of colony structuring on disease dynamics and social immunity is also analyzed theoretically using mathematical models.|$|E

2500|$|One {{theory on}} the origin of {{bipedalism}} is the behavioral model presented by C. Owen Lovejoy, known as [...] "male provisioning". Lovejoy theorizes that the evolution of bipedalism was linked to monogamy. In the face of long inter-birth intervals and low reproductive rates typical of the apes, early hominids engaged in pair-bonding that enabled greater parental effort directed towards rearing offspring. Lovejoy proposes that male provisioning of food would improve the offspring <b>survivorship</b> and increase the pair's reproductive rate. Thus the male would leave his mate and offspring to search for food and return carrying the food in his arms walking on his legs. This model is supported by the reduction ("feminization") of the male canine teeth in early hominids such as Sahelanthropus tchadensis and Ardipithecus ramidus, which along with low body size dimorphism in Ardipithecus and Australopithecus, suggests a reduction in inter-male antagonistic behavior in early hominids. In addition, this model is supported by a number of modern human traits associated with concealed ovulation (permanently enlarged breasts, lack of sexual swelling) and low sperm competition (moderate sized testes, low sperm mid-piece volume) that argues against recent adaptation to a polygynous reproductive system.|$|E
