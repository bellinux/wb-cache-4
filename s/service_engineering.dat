25|$|Soon {{after the}} end of World War I, the US Army sought to explore highly armored and armed {{specialist}} ground-attack aircraft. This was a pet project of General William Mitchell. The Army Air <b>Service</b> <b>Engineering</b> Division issued requests for proposals to U.S. aircraft producers on 15 October 1919. There were no designs offered, so the Engineering Division ordered one of its engineers, Isaac M. Laddon, to attempt what the aviation industry clearly considered impossible. His design, designated GAX, first flew at McCook Field on 26 May 1920. The GAX was McCook Field Project P129 and wore AAS serial number 63272.|$|E

In 1921, he was transferred to Kelly Field where he assumed command of the 94th Pursuit Squadron of the 1st Pursuit Group. On 20 July 1921, he participated in Brigadier General Billy Mitchell's [...] of the ex-German dreadnought Ostfriesland. The 1st Pursuit Group moved to Selfridge Field, Michigan in July 1922. In 1926, Whitehead attended the Air <b>Service</b> <b>Engineering</b> School at McCook Field, graduating first in his class.|$|E
500|$|From July to November 1920, Kenney was air {{detachment}} commander at Camp Knox, Kentucky. He {{then became}} {{a student at the}} Air <b>Service</b> <b>Engineering</b> School at McCook Field, near Dayton Ohio. He was the Air Service Inspector at the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company in Garden City, New York, where he was responsible for the acceptance of the fifty Martin NBS-1 bombers that the Air Service had ordered from Curtis between 1921 and 1923. Kenney inspected the aircraft, and test flew them. While there, he was reduced in rank from captain to first lieutenant on 18 November 1922, a common occurrence in the aftermath of World War I when the wartime army was demobilized. He returned to McCook in 1923, and developed techniques for mounting [...]30 caliber machine guns on the wings of a DH.4. He was promoted to captain again on 3 November 1923. His daughter, Julia Churchill Kenney, was born in Dayton in June 1926.|$|E

2500|$|Planning for a {{transoceanic flight}} began in February 1919 at McCook Field in Dayton, Ohio, {{by members of}} the Air Service, the {{immediate}} forerunner of the Air Corps. 2nd Lt. Albert F. Hegenberger, an MIT-trained aeronautical engineer assigned to the Air <b>Service</b> <b>Engineering</b> Division, established the Instrument Branch to study ideas in air navigation (or avigation, as it was referred to at that time), and produce [...] "new developments in compasses, airspeed meters, driftmeters, sextants, and maps." [...] Hegenberger educated himself in over-water flight by attending a U.S. Navy course in navigation at Pensacola, Florida, that included flights over the Gulf of Mexico practicing dead reckoning and celestial navigation.|$|E
