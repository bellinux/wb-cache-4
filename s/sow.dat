40|$|Purpose: The paper {{presents}} two <b>sowing</b> {{machines for}} interval <b>sowing,</b> differing {{in the mode}} of operation. The pneumatic vacuum <b>sowing</b> machine OLT and the pneumatic pressure <b>sowing</b> machine Aeromat - Becker for <b>sowing</b> sugar beet are compared.

Design/methodology/approach: The measurements were performed with two <b>sowing</b> machines which are most widely used in Slovenia; the <b>sowing</b> machines were tested in completely identical conditions at different speeds of <b>sowing.</b> Findings: The parameters such as working efficiency, depth of <b>sowing,</b> inter - row distance and distance between seeds in the <b>sowing</b> row were measured and calculated. Research limitations/implications: Cultivation of sugar beet depends primarily on expert and technically correct <b>sowing.</b> Distance between seeds in the <b>sowing</b> row must enable the plants to have optimum conditions for their growth and development. For successful <b>sowing</b> it is necessary to know adequacy of the soil for <b>sowing,</b> technical properties of the <b>sowing</b> machine and biotechnical characteristics of the seed. Practical implications: <b>Sowing</b> machines and expertly performed <b>sowing</b> are of great importance for cultivation of sugar beet. The principal aim of the paper is to establish whether the higher working speed influences the quality of <b>sowing.</b> The tests were aimed at defining the most suitable <b>sowing</b> speed for both <b>sowing</b> machines on the basis of measured data. Cultivation of sugar beet requires much money invested and work performed per unit of area. It is very important for the producers to be well familiarized with all agro - technical measures.

5|$|Since the {{abolition}} of bishops within the Scottish Church in 1689, ownership of the abandoned cathedral fell to the crown, but no attempt to halt {{the decline of the}} building took place. Acknowledging the necessity to stabilise the structure, the Elgin Town Council initiated the reconstruction of the perimeter wall in 1809 and cleared debris from the surrounding area in about 1815. The Lord Provost of Elgin petitioned the King's Remembrancer for assistance to build a new roof for the chapterhouse and in 1824, £121 was provided to the architect Robert Reid for its construction. Reid was significant {{in the development of a}} conservation policy for historical buildings in Scotland and was to become the first Head of the Scottish Office of Works (<b>SOW)</b> in 1827.

40|$|Lodging {{resistance}} of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) {{can be increased}} by late <b>sowing.</b> However, whether grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) can be maintained with delayed <b>sowing</b> remains unknown. During the 2013 â 2014 and 2014 â 2015 growing seasons, two winter wheat cultivars were <b>sown</b> on three dates (early <b>sowing</b> on October 1, normal <b>sowing</b> on October 8, and late <b>sowing</b> on October 15) to investigate the responses of lodging resistance, grain yield, and NUE to <b>sowing</b> date. No significant differences in lodging resistance, grain yield, or NUE between early and normal <b>sowing</b> were observed. Averaging over the two cultivars and years, postponing the <b>sowing</b> date significantly increased lodging resistance by 53. 6 % and 49. 6 % compared with that following early and normal <b>sowing,</b> respectively. Lodging resistance was improved mainly through {{a reduction in the}} culm height at the center of gravity and an increase in the tensile strength of the base internode. Late <b>sowing</b> resulted in similar grain yield as well as kernel weight and number of kernels per square meter, compared to early and normal <b>sowing.</b> Averaging over the two cultivars and years, delayed <b>sowing</b> resulted in a reduction in nitrogen uptake efficiency (UPE) by 11. 0 % and 9. 9 % compared to early and normal <b>sowing,</b> respectively, owing to reduced root length density and dry matter accumulation before anthesis. An average increase in nitrogen utilization efficiency (UTE) of 12. 9 % and 11. 2 % compared to early and normal <b>sowing,</b> respectively, was observed with late <b>sowing</b> owing to a reduction in the grain nitrogen concentration. The increase in UTE offset the reduction in UPE, resulting in equal NUEs among all <b>sowing</b> dates. Thus, <b>sowing</b> later than normal could increase lodging resistance while maintaining grain yield and NUE.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effects of back-fat thickness at d 107 of gestation and housing types during gestation on reproductive performance and behavior of <b>sows.</b> A total of 64 crossbred <b>sows</b> (Landrace×Yorkshire) in their 3 to 4 parities were allotted to one of four treatments (n = 16) over two consecutive parities. During each parity, <b>sows</b> were assigned to two gestational housing types (stall or group housing) and two level of back-fat thickness (< 20 or ≥ 20) at d 107 of gestation. Gestating <b>sows</b> were transferred from gestational crates to stalls or pens (group housing) 5 weeks before farrowing. All <b>sows</b> were moved to farrowing crates on d 109 of gestation. At weaning, back-fat thickness changes were lesser (p< 0. 05) in <b>sows</b> having back-fat thickness < 20 mm than that of <b>sows</b> with ≥ 20 mm back-fat thickness at 107 d of gestation. Group housed <b>sows</b> had greater (p< 0. 05) feed intake and shorter (p< 0. 05) weaning-to-estrus interval than that of <b>sows</b> in stalls. At weaning, back-fat thickness changes were lesser (p< 0. 05) in group housed <b>sows</b> than that of <b>sows</b> in stalls.

For this purpose cortisol level was determined five days before farrowing, five days after farrowing and a day after weaning. Besides cortisol, other haematological parameters were determined in the blood, also. Statistically significant higher concentration of cortisol was determined at five days before farrowing in <b>sows</b> housed freely compared to <b>sows</b> housed industrially (p< 0. 05). Five days after farrowing and a day after weaning, concentrations of cortisol were lower in the blood of freely housed <b>sows</b> compared to industrially housed <b>sows.</b> However, the difference was not significant. The level of cortisol determined in <b>sows</b> housed freely during pregnancy, and after dislocation into wedged farrowing departments, five days before farrowing, was significantly higher than in industrial <b>sows.</b> The aforesaid confirmed stress that can be induced by relocating the <b>sows</b> to a new location and wedged space. The level of cortisol, determined in industrial <b>sows</b> was almost of equal values during the whole research, the fact being related to constant stress conditions...|$|R
