40|$|Despite {{a number}} of {{intriguing}} utilities associated with thioamide-containing peptides and proteins {{in the context of}} biophysics, pharmacology and chemical biology, it has hitherto remained as one of the underexplored territories of peptidomimetics. The synthesis of long mono to multiply substituted endothioamide peptides is invariably accompanied with severe epimerization, oxoamide formation and various other undesired side reactions, resulting in messy product profiles. This has completely restrained their use as novel chemical tools for biological studies. During the chain elongation of an N-terminally located thioamide peptide using the Fmoc/t-Bu chemistry, it becomes vulnerable to the repetitive basic treatments as required for such chemistry. The incompatibility of thioamide moiety with bases as well as strong coupling reagents leads to epimerization as well as other side reactions due to its nucleophilicity, resulting in the loss of the stereochemical identity of the thioamidated amino acid residue. An easy-to-implement and efficient protocol to synthesize long (> 10 -mer) endothioamide peptides, significantly suppressing epimerization and other side reactions using 10 % piperidine/dimethylformamide for 1 min, is reported herein. The novelty of the protocol is shown through the efficient synthesis of {{a number of}} 10 - 12 -mer mono to multiply thioamide-substituted peptides with broad <b>substrate</b> <b>scopes.</b> The utility of the protocol in the context of protein engineering and chemical protein synthesis is also shown through the synthesis of a thioamide version of the 16 -mer peptide from the B 1 domain of protein G.

40|$|While {{transition}} metal catalyzed cross coupling reactions have {{become one of}} the most useful strategies in constructing carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bond formations, major disadvantages such as high reaction temperature, expansive metal catalysts input and limited reaction <b>substrates</b> <b>scope</b> have significantly downshifted the applications of those two electron involved transformations. Comparably, the studies on the redox coupling reactions are less investigated. Derived from single electron transfer process, the redox coupling reactions can be used to construct otherwise challenging chemical bonds efficiently, such as Csp 3 -Csp 3 bond. Recently, visible light mediated photoredox catalysis has merged as a highly prominent tool in the development of many unconventional organic transformations. Those transformations are typically conducted in an extremely mild reaction conditions only by irradiating reaction mixtures under visible light or sunshine at room temperature and without any ligand addition. Hence, exceptional efforts are needed for further exploration of those photoredox catalyzed organic transformations. This work described an innovation approach of using visible light photoredox catalysis to develop efficient one-step syntheses for the construction of structurally diverse amine substituted novel cyclic and acyclic organic motifs from easily prepared starting materials. Amines are typically used as a sacrificial electron donor in a photoredox derived reaction. Nan Zheng recently revealed that by incorporating amine into a reductive quenching photoredox catalytic cycle, amine can be used as both the sacrificial electron donor and substrate. To accomplish this, N-cyclobutylanilines were oxidized to its corresponding amine radical cation by a photoredox catalyst upon irradiation under visible light, which would lead to a distonic radical cation through a C-C bond cleavage of cyclobutyl ring. The distonic radical cation can be trapped by a pi bond such as alkene or alkyne to reveal a novel amine substituted six membered carbon cycle through a [4 + 2] annulation reaction. Alternatively, by introducing a nucleophile such as trimethylsilyl cyanide and a radical acceptor such as allylsulfone derivative, a difunctionalization of N-cyclobutylanilines has been realized through a multicomponent reaction fashion. The method was further expanded to the success difunctionalization of fused cyclopropylanilines.
