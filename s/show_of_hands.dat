5|$|The {{presiding}} consul began each {{meeting with}} a speech on an issue, and then referred the issue to the senators, who discussed the matter by order of seniority. Unimportant matters could be voted on by a voice vote or by a <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands,</b> while important votes resulted in a physical division of the house, with senators voting by taking a place {{on either side of}} the chamber. Any vote was always between a proposal and its negative.|$|E
5|$|Having been a {{professional}} musician since the mid-'60s (and the guitarist for King Crimson since 1969), {{by the late}} 1980s Robert Fripp found himself in conflict with his longtime record label E.G.Records and management company (E.G. Management) over royalties allegedly owed by E.G. to himself and to other band members. During this period, Fripp met and began working with producer and online developer David Singleton, initially on a Guitar Craft tour in 1990 and subsequently on the production of two albums - the League of Crafty Guitarists' <b>Show</b> <b>of</b> <b>Hands</b> and the eponymous album for the Fripp-and-Toyah-fronted group Sunday All Over the World. Fripp and Singleton's production partnership was sealed by work on two King Crimson boxed sets (1991's Frame by Frame and 1992's The Great Deceiver) and continues {{to the present day}} under the name of TonProb.|$|E
50|$|The Assembly makes {{decisions}} through consensus {{to ensure}} that all opinions, ideas and concerns are taken into account before committing to a collective decision that work for everyone. Voting is done through the <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> signals. Currently, a proposal is passed when there are no blocks from the Assembly during voting. Members who block a proposal are required to provide a justification.|$|R

5|$|Once a vote occurred, and {{a measure}} passed, {{he could do}} nothing, since his promise to {{physically}} interpose his person against the senators was now meaningless. In addition, during a couple of instances {{between the end of}} the Second Punic War in 201 BC {{and the beginning of the}} Social War in 91 BC, although they had no legal power to do so, several Consuls were known to have vetoed acts of the Senate. Ultimately, if there was no veto, and the matter was of minor importance, it could be voted on by a voice vote or by a <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands.</b> If there was no veto, and the matter was of a significant nature, there was usually a physical division of the house, where senators voted by taking a place on either side of the chamber.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the second}} day, the Seimas adopted a four-{{paragraph}} resolution. The first paragraph declared that the Tsarist government was Lithuania's most dangerous enemy. The second paragraph demanded autonomy; the third outlined the means towards this goal that were deemed acceptable. The resistance was to be peaceful and passive. The fourth and final paragraph demanded that children be taught in their native language by teachers chosen by the people. The Seimas, unlike the 1917 Vilnius Conference, did not attempt to elect an institution that could carry out these resolutions and act as a Lithuanian government. After the Seimas, rural areas were left on their own without central guidance. After the resolution was adopted by the Seimas, near midnight, Jonas Basanavičius read aloud his proposal to include an attachment condemning Polish ecclesiastical authorities for suppressing the use of the Lithuanian language in churches within the diocese of Vilnius. The church matters had not been discussed during the sessions, but the majority agreed to the proposal by a <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands.</b> Because the attachment was not fully discussed, Social Democrats did not consider it officially adopted.|$|E
5|$|During sessions, {{members may}} speak after being called {{on by the}} President. Members of the Council or Commission may also attend and speak in debates. Partly due {{to the need for}} translation, and the {{politics}} of consensus in the chamber, debates tend to be calmer and more polite than, say, the Westminster system. Voting is conducted primarily by a <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands,</b> that may be checked on request by electronic voting. Votes of MEPs are not recorded in either case, however; that only occurs when there is a roll-call ballot. This is required for the final votes on legislation and also whenever a political group or 30 MEPs request it. The number of roll-call votes has increased with time. Votes can also be a completely secret ballot (for example, when the president is elected). All recorded votes, along with minutes and legislation, are recorded in the Official Journal of the European Union and can be accessed online. Votes usually do not follow a debate, but rather they are grouped with other due votes on specific occasions, usually at noon on Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays. This is because the length of the vote is unpredictable and if it continues for longer than allocated it can disrupt other debates and meetings later in the day.|$|E
50|$|Nominations {{take place}} at the chiefdoms. On the day of nomination, the name of the nominee is raised by a <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> and the nominee is given an {{opportunity}} to indicate whether he or she accepts the nomination. If he or she accepts it, he or she must be supported by at least ten members of that chiefdom. The nominations are for the position of Member of Parliament, Constituency Headman (Indvuna) and the Constituency Executive Committee (Bucopho). The minimum number of nominees is four and the maximum is ten.|$|R

5|$|On 6 July 2004 {{in an open}} letter, Sihanouk {{announced}} his plans to abdicate. At the same time, he criticised Hun Sen and Ranariddh for ignoring his {{suggestions on how to}} resolve the political stalemate of the past year. Meanwhile, Hun Sen and Ranariddh had agreed to introduce a constitutional amendment that provided for an open voting system, requiring parliamentarians to select cabinet ministers {{and the president of the}} National Assembly by a <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands.</b> Sihanouk disapproved of the open voting system, calling upon Senate President Chea Sim not to sign the amendment. When Chea Sim heeded Sihanouk's advice, he was ferried out of the country shortly before the National Assembly convened to vote on the amendment on 15July. On 17July 2004, the CPP and FUNCINPEC agreed to form a coalition government, leaving SRP out as an opposition party. On 6October 2004, Sihanouk wrote a letter calling for the throne council to convene and select a successor. The National Assembly and Senate both held emergency meetings to pass laws allowing for the abdication of the monarch. On 14October 2004 the throne council unanimously voted to select Norodom Sihamoni as Sihanouk's successor. Sihamoni was crowned as the King of Cambodia on 29October 2004.|$|E

25|$|The CNT {{generally}} avoids bringing {{matters to}} a vote, preferring consensus decision-making, which it {{considers to be}} {{more in tune with}} its anarchist principles.

25|$|The tense {{situation}} {{began to}} boil over.

A <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands</b> indicated that a large majority of pickers at the meeting were in favor of a strike. The crowd remained peaceful and sang Wobbly songs through the afternoon.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the Democratic caucus, the Republican Party {{does not}} use voting rounds or have minimum {{requirements}} for a percent of votes. The Republican version is done with a straw vote of those attending the caucus. This vote is sometimes done by a <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands</b> or by dividing themselves into groups according to candidate. However, officially it is done with voters receiving a blank {{piece of paper with}} no names on it, and the voter writing a name and placing it in a ballot box.|$|E
5000|$|When {{adopting}} the laws the Parliament violated {{a number of}} its own procedural rules. The laws were voted mostly by <b>showing</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands.</b> This is allowed by the Rules of Procedureuk but only {{when there is no}} [...] "technical possibility" [...] to vote through the electronic system. Moreover, hands were [...] "counted" [...] within a few seconds, {{based on the number of}} MPs included in the parliamentary groups, while many MPs were in fact absent. Diplomas observing the votes counted only some 100 to 140 raised hands, while the laws would have needed to be adopted by a majority of 226 votes. Most of the laws were adopted without prior consideration in the parliament's committees as required and with no time for examining the laws even by the MPs.|$|R

25|$|The National Congress {{assembled}} in the morning. It first voted to accept Zelaya's resignation letter, dated 25 June, which Zelaya denied signing. It studied a special report on Zelaya, and by a <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands,</b> the National Congress – the majority of whom belonged to Zelaya's own Liberal party – appointed the President of the National Congress Roberto Micheletti, a member of Zelaya's party, to be president to succeed Zelaya. Noteworthy that the president changed his political leanings during his administration, from right to left, which earned him the antipathy by his party colleagues.|$|E
25|$|Under party rules, any Liberal MP or senator can {{propose a}} motion to spill the party's leadership. The leader of the party then invites a {{discussion}} of the motion at a party room meeting, and makes a decision whether to call a vote on the matter based on the sentiments which are expressed. The leader can also choose to conduct this vote through a public <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands</b> or a secret ballot. Abbott stated, before the ballot, that it would be conducted in secret, as has previously occurred. By convention, Liberal Party ministers are expected to vote against conducting leadership spills.|$|E
