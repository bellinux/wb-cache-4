50|$|Traditional {{crossbreeding}} {{has been}} used for centuries to improve crop quality and quantity. Crossbreeding mates two <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>species</b> to create a new variety with the desired traits of the parents. For example, the honeycrisp apple exhibits a specific texture and flavor due to the crossbreeding of its parents. In traditional practices, pollen from one plant is placed on the female part of another, which leads to a hybrid that contains genetic information from both parent plants. Plant breeders select the plants with the traits they’re looking to pass on and continue to breed those plants. Note that crossbreeding can only be utilized within the same or closely related species.|$|E
30|$|Railways {{represent}} an ideal system for herbicide resistant transgenic plants {{to establish and}} spread {{as a result of}} high selective pressure in favour of herbicide resistance with consequent increased difficulties to keep the infrastructure free of weeds. Crop-to-wild gene flow can occur as several <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>species</b> which are congeneric or in allied genera to oilseed rape were found growing sympatrically. Moreover, the capillary presence of railways in the agricultural landscape provides a putative source of contamination of GE-free agriculture. Our results suggests that carefully adapted monitoring designs may be set in order to detect introduction events that can lead to rapid establishment and growing populations as the accepted contamination thresholds are likely to be biologically insufficient to prevent further environmental contamination.|$|E
40|$|Over 25 000 {{transgenic}} {{field trials}} were conducted globally from 1986 - 1997, and many transgenic crops, including soybean (Glycine max), maize (Zea mays), tobacco (Nicotiana tabaccum), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), canola (Brassica napus, B. rapa), tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) and potato (Solarium tuberosum) have been commercially released. There {{has been a}} high adoption rate, with at least 28 million ha reported for 1998, with herbicide- and insect-resistant plants occupying 71 and 28 % of the releases, respectively. The current status of commercial production of transgenic crops in Canada is summarized. Transgenic crops {{have the potential to}} change weed communities/populations in three principal ways, via: 1) escape and proliferation of the transgenic plants as 'weedy' volunteers with subsequent displacement of the crop, weed and/or natural vegetation; 2) hybridization with and transgene infiltration into related weedy and/or wild species, resulting in invigorated weeds and/or alteration of natural gene frequencies in these species; and 3) genetic changes in populations of unrelated species, as a result of changes to the environment, in particular herbicide-resistant (HR) transgenic crops and the development of HR weeds. Potential risk can be estimated a priori using knowledge of the systematics of crop/wild/weed complexes. Risk must be assessed on a case-by-case basis for each crop, each country/ecological region, and for each trait. Potential weed risks will be greater if crop volunteers are predisposed to becoming weedy, are well adapted to the Canadian climate and if <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> wild <b>species</b> are present...|$|R

For identification of the parental types of cpDNA, these studies used parents that have differences in restriction fragment length polymorphisms and exhibit partial sexual incompatibility. Methodology/Principal Findings: In the present study, we used <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> parents of the isogamous colonial volvocalean Gonium maiaprilis that seemed an ideal species to identify the pattern of cpDNA inheritance based on the length difference in the putative group I intron interrupted in the Rubisco large subunit gene and objective identification of mating types by {{the presence or absence}} of the minus-dominance (MID) gene. We examined patterns of inheritance of cpDNA and presence/absence of a MID ortholog (GmMID) in 107 F 1 progeny of G. maiaprilis that were obtained by inducing germination of separated single zygotes. The results demonstrated no exception of the uniparental inheritance of cpDNA from the MT+ parent (lacking GmMID) in <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> or genetically less divergent strains of G. maiaprilis. Conclusions/Significance: The present data suggest that the uniparental inheritance of cpDNA is likely more strict in crossings of less diverged strains or <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> parental volvocaleans, and some genetic inconsistency betwee...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of modern}} {{biotechnology}} to create genetically modified products has been haled by some but scorned by others. In crop im-provement, conventional plant breeding is a 20 th century phenomenon. Gene exchanges occur primarily in <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>species,</b> {{and they are}} largely crosses. Breeders select primarily on observable attributes, for exam-ple, grain yield, disease or pest resistance, {{but there is little}} DNA knowledge (Lamkey). In contrast, modern biotechnology is the human mediated insertion of a synthetic gene(s) into an organism. The technique for recombinant DNA was discovered by Cohen and Boyer in 1973. The Cohen–Boyer patent for gene-splicing technology was awarded in 1980, and it enabled the “gene revolution ” of the 1990 s. Transfers of genes are largely between sexually incompatible species. Gene(s) produce(s) pro-teins of interest, which are input/output traits. These transfers are sometimes said to be “pre-cise, ” because the origin of the trait is known through DNA sequencing.

Using a combination of local knowledge and herbarium samples, S. spontaneum has been documented at five previously unpublished locations in Australia. Analysis of the DNA of plants growing at each of these locations, by molecular markers, showed vegetative propagation at three sites, predominantly vegetative propagation at a fourth and the presence of a more diverse set of plants at the fifth.

40|$|The {{planting}} of 162 ha of transgenic glyphosate-resistant creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera) near Madras, OR, USA, allowed {{a unique opportunity}} to study gene flow over time from a perennial outcrossing species at the landscape level. While conducting a four year in situ survey, we collected panicles and leaf tissue samples from creeping bentgrass and its <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>species.</b> Seeds from the panicles were planted, and seedlings were tested in the greenhouse for expression of the transgene. Gene flow via pollen was found in all four years, at frequencies of 0. 004 to 2. 805 %. Chloroplast markers, in combination with internal transcribed spacer nuclear sequence analysis, were used to aid in identification of transgenic interspecific and intergeneric hybrid seedlings found during the testing and of established plants that could not be positively identified in the field. Interspecific transgenic hybrids produced on redtop (Agrostis gigantea) plants in situ were identified three of the four years and one intergeneric transgenic creeping bentgrass x rabbitfoot grass (Polypogon monspeliensis) hybrid was identified in 2005. In addition, we confirmed a non-transgenic creeping bentgrass x redtop hybrid in situ, demonstrating that interspecific hybrids have established in the environment outside production fields.

30|$|A further {{source of}} {{concern is the}} {{potential}} for hybridisation with related species. In fact, many of the <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>species</b> cited in [27] can be found in ruderal habitats in Switzerland [40]. In particular, several of them were detected on the railroads of Ticino (e.g. Brassica oleracea L., Brassica rapa L., Diplotaxis muralis (L.) DC., Diplotaxis tenuifolia (L.) DC., Erucastrum gallicum (Willd.) O.E. Schulz, Raphanus raphanistrum L., Rapistrum rugosum (L.) All.), and often grow sympatrically with oilseed rape [29, 30]. For most of these species, hybridisation frequencies with oilseed rape are very low, but introgression can occur significantly with B. rapa (reviewed in [41]). However, under strong selection pressure such as regular herbicide application on railway infrastructure, a rare hybridisation event may have significant biological consequences. For instance, a previous study on the prickly (wild) lettuce (Lactuca serriola L.), an almost completely autogamous species with low hybridisation rates with its cultivated counterpart Lactuca sativa L. (tens of times lower than between oilseed rape and B. rapa), showed that even rare hybridization events could have important consequences on the introgression of conventional and/or GE-traits even in absence of continued hybridization [42]. Railway habitat may act as a catalyst of gene flow from GMHT oilseed rape to its wild relatives. Moreover, B. rapa may act as a bridge for gene flow towards species with low hybridization frequencies with oilseed rape, but that are sexually compatible with B. rapa.|$|E
40|$|Any {{attempt to}} create new crops or improve an {{existing}} crop is accompanied by certain environmental impacts. In the last 15 years, significant public attention {{has been focused on}} the problems of large-scale cultivation of transgenic or genetically modified (GM) crops. The use of such crops can solve a number of acute problems in agriculture. At the same time, the media has published articles about the negative effects of GM organisms on human health and the environment. Taking into account the cautious and often openly negative attitude of soci-ety toward biotechnological varieties, public interest in the environmental and food safety of novel products is always present. Official bodies often oblige by provid-ing numerous, cumbersome, and not scientifically sub-stantiated checks. This process unnecessarily hinders the introduction of newly developed varieties. There-fore, it is important to create a universal system of sci-ence-based risk assessment of GM plants; this would be optimal in terms of time and cost and provides the nec-essary level of safety. One of the most important aspects of this problem is to assess the risk of vertical gene flow from transgenic plants to the wild populations of <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>species.</b> Although there were no scientifically confirmed cases of negative effects on the environment caused by vertical gene flow, we cannot rule it out in the future. Risk assessment requires a generalization of the many factors that affect vertical gene flow in complex biologi-cal and ecological systems. First, the risk assessment should take into account the geographical conditions, biological behavior of a transgenic species, and their wild relatives growing in respective geographical zones (i. e., in Ukraine). Therefore, this study looks at the pre-liminary risk assessment of GM plants before their field release in Ukraine. Scientifically grounded risk assessment requires a multidisciplinary approach in order to make decisions that would be understandable and acceptable to all. For those purposes, we adopted usage of the criteria based on calculation of gene flow indices (Novozhylov & Blume, 2001) after the idea first proposed by F. T. d...|$|E

The expression of this construct allows normal plant and seed development but inhibits seed germination. Plants containing the SL construct were crossed with plants containing the tet R gene to derive plant lines where {{the expression of the}} SL construct is repressed.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} five {{molecular}} genetic studies on flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) are described, of which two chapters aim {{to characterize the}} genetic structure {{and the amount of}} genetic diversity in the primary and secondary gene pool of the crop species. Three chapters describe the development of AFLP markers, linkage map construction and QTL analysis of resistance and quality traits. Genetic diversity in the primary gene pool was studied by AFLP fingerprinting 110 varieties representing linseed and fiber flax germplasm, the two cultivar groups in flax. Fiber flax germplasm is a narrow subset within linseed flax, and modern breeding tends to further narrow the genetic diversity. Forty two AFLP bands showed strong association with cultivar group.  In a second diversity study 52 accessions of 27 Linum species could be differentiated in clearly distinct groups. These groups showed some resemblance to the current taxonomic grouping of species in sections of the genus Linum, but many aberrations were observed. In our view the <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> wild <b>species</b> L. bienne and L. angustifolium should be excellent sources to broaden the genetic basis of L. usitatissimum. In view of the extremely low number of polymorphic markers in AFLP fingerprints, an entire study was dedicated to select primer combinations with the highest number of markers. Unselected primer combinations show on average 2. 3 and 3. 8 polymorphisms for two different parental combinations. Our selection of favourable primer combinations has on average 7. 2 and 10. 7 markers, allowing a 50 % reduction of the workload involved in linkage map construction. An unexpected side effect of this selection was the frequent occurrence of allelic codominant length polymorphisms among the resulting AFLP markers. Two linkage maps were constructed in mapping populations descending from a fiber x fiber and a fiber x linseed cross. These maps were integrated to obtain a linkage map of flax. Two different computer algorithms were used to calculate marker order, JoinMap and RECORD, which are complementary, and their joint use allowed reaching the most plausible marker order. For 18 different traits involved in disease resistance (Fusarium wilt and scorch) and quality traits related to fiber yield and quality, as well as fatty acid composition we identified a total of 63 QTL positions. In practical breeding some of these QTL loci could be of high practical value. Phenotypic selection of these loci would require field trials of the highest quality, but genotypic selection of these loci is easily pursued with DNA diagnostics. In view of the results obtained with these five molecular genetic studies recommendations are made to implement Marker Assisted Breeding (MAB), to proceed with linkage disequilibrium studies and to broaden the genetic basis of fiber flax breeding, for example {{with the aid of a}} library of backcross introgression lines...|$|R
30|$|In 2002, the Scotts Company (Marysville, OH, USA) started {{field trials}} with genetically {{engineered}} creeping bentgrass (A. stolonifera) in central Oregon (USA) {{near the city}} of Madras. The 2002 field trial comprised an area of 160  ha. In 2004, it was found that transgenes from bentgrass which had been made tolerant to herbicides containing glyphosate as the active ingredient had introgressed into wild growing bentgrass populations via pollen flow [5]. Outcrossing in wild bentgrass populations and the <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>species</b> Agrostis gigantea took place at distances of up to 14  km; cross-pollination by using trap plants was even found at a distance of 21  km [5]. In 2003, a storm caused wide-scale dispersal of transgenic bentgrass pollen. Attempts to remove all genetically engineered plants failed. During the years that followed, transgenic bentgrass was found all over the investigated area [6]. Tests conducted along irrigation canals showed {{that more than half of}} the investigated plants contained the glyphosate tolerance gene cp 4 epsps [7]. Currently, transgenic bentgrass can be found along irrigation canals, in roadside ditches, grassland and in fields. Genetically engineered bentgrass also escaped from a second field trial in Idaho [8]. Several years after the end of the field trial, transgenic plants were found in Canyon County (Idaho) as well as Malheur County in nearby Oregon. Apparently, transports were the reason for the dispersal [8]. According to a recent publication, even interspecific hybridisation with related species takes place. Hybrids were identified as rabbitfoot grass (P. monspeliensis) that had introgressed into feral transgenic bentgrass [9]. Bentgrass is a perennial plant with many compatible related species [10]. Bentgrass as well as several relatives has invasive traits and are considered to be weeds [5, 11]. Field trials in the 1990 s have shown that herbicide tolerance genes can introgress into related species like Agrostis canina, Agrostis capillaris or Agrostis castellana[12]. A. stolonifera is wind-pollinated and produces large amounts of low-weight pollen. Up to 100, 000 pollens per square meter were detected at a 2 - to 3 -km distance from bentgrass fields [13]. Propagation may also take place by stolons [14]. An additional problem in the US bentgrass case is the fact that Oregon is the main production area for bentgrass seeds [14]. Bentgrass seed from Oregon is also exported to the EU and to other regions [15].|$|E

Estimation of gene flow described by average number of migrants was 0. 72 followed by 0. 20 migrants. Due to the observed gene migrations, genetic drift and selection, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was not met. The mean number of alleles over all loci was 16. 9, the average polymorphic information content was 0. 43.

40|$|Aspergillus flavus colonizes {{agricultural}} commodities {{worldwide and}} contaminates them with carcinogenic aflatoxins. The high genetic diversity of A. flavus populations is {{largely due to}} sexual reproduction characterized by the formation of ascospore-bearing ascocarps embedded within sclerotia. A. flavus is heterothallic and laboratory crosses between strains of the opposite mating type produce progeny showing genetic recombination. Sclerotia formed in crops are dispersed onto the soil surface at harvest and are predominantly produced by single strains of one mating type. Less commonly, sclerotia may be fertilized during co-infection of crops with <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> strains. In this study, laboratory and field experiments were performed to examine sexual reproduction in single-strain and fertilized sclerotia following exposure of sclerotia to natural fungal populations in soil. Female and male roles and mitochondrial inheritance in A. flavus were also examined through reciprocal crosses between sclerotia and conidia. Single-strain sclerotia produced ascospores on soil and progeny showed biparental inheritance that included novel alleles originating from fertilization by native soil strains. Sclerotia fertilized in the laboratory and applied to soil before ascocarp formation also produced ascospores with evidence of recombination in progeny, but only known parental alleles were detected. In reciprocal crosses, sclerotia and conidia from both strains functioned as female and male, respectively, indicating A. flavus is hermaphroditic, although the degree of fertility depended upon the parental sources of sclerotia and conidia.

40|$|Background and Aims Despite {{differences}} in morphology, the genera representing "true citrus fruit trees" are <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible,</b> and their phylogenetic relationships remain unclear. Most {{of the important}} commercial 'species' of Citrus {{are believed to be}} of interspecific origin. By studying polymorphisms of 27 nuclear genes, the average molecular differentiation between species was estimated and some phylogenetic relationships between 'true citrus fruit trees' were clarified. -Methods Sanger sequencing of PCR-amplified fragments from 18 genes involved in metabolite biosynthesis pathways and nine putative genes for salt tolerance was performed for 45 genotypes of Citrus and relatives of Citrus to mine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and indel polymorphisms. Fifty nuclear simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were also analysed. -Key Results A total of 16 238 kb of DNA was sequenced for each genotype, and 1097 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 50 indels were identified. These polymorphisms were more valuable than SSRs for intertaxon differentiation. Nuclear phylogenetic analysis revealed that Citrus reticulata and Fortunella form a cluster that is differentiated from the clade that includes three other basic taxa of cultivated citrus (C. maxima, C. medica and C. micrantha). These results confirm the taxonomic subdivision between the subgenera Metacitrus and Archicitrus. A few genes displayed positive selection patterns within or between species, but most of them displayed neutral patterns. The phylogenetic inheritance patterns of the analysed genes were inferred for commercial Citrus spp. -Conclusions Numerous molecular polymorphisms (SNPs and indels), which are potentially useful for the analysis of interspecific genetic structures, have been identified. The nuclear phylogenetic network for Citrus and its <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> relatives was consistent with the geographical origins of these genera. The positive selection observed for a few genes will help further works to analyse the molecular basis of the variability of the associated traits.

This study examined the distribution of nuclear and mitochondrial genotypes in a natural, local population of the fungal (Basidiomycetes) root-rot pathogen, Armillaria. Six vegetative clones, ranging in size up to 635 m, were identified {{on the basis of}} mating-type alleles. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) restriction fragment patterns indicated that each vegetative clone has one, unique mtDNA type. However, as in other basidiomycetous fungi, biparental transmission of mitochondria following laboratory matings of <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> haploid isolates of Armillaria resulted in a uniformly diploid mycelium that was a mosaic for both parental mitochondrial types. Therefore, either matings between monosporous, haploid isolates are uncommon in nature, or when mating does occur, cytoplasmic markers of one partner predominate during subsequent vegetative growth...|$|R
5000|$|In {{a line of}} {{work that}} {{regularly}} demands that personnel be in close living quarters, allowing openly homosexual servicemen is argued to flout a fundamental tenet of military service: ensuring that soldiers remain undistracted from their mission. If gay men are allowed to shower with their fellow male soldiers, so goes the argument, this would, in effect, violate the [...] "unique conditions" [...] of military life by putting <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> partners in close proximity, with potentially adverse effects on retention and morale of troops. Testimony advanced during the hearings on Don't Ask, Don't Tell of 1993, with US Senator Sam Nunn and General Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr. recalled [...] "“instances where heterosexuals have been solicited to commit homosexual acts, and, even more traumatic emotionally, physically coerced to engage in such acts.” ...|$|R
5|$|The {{life cycle}} of Cyathus helenae {{contains}} both haploid and diploid stages, typical of taxa in the basidiomycetes that can reproduce both asexually (via vegetative spores), or sexually (with meiosis). Basidiospores produced in the peridioles each contain a single haploid nucleus. After dispersal, the spores germinate and grow into homokaryotic hyphae, with a single nucleus in each compartment. When two homokaryotic hyphae of different mating compatibility groups fuse with one another, they form a dikaryotic mycelia in a process called plasmogamy. After {{a period of time}} and under the appropriate environmental conditions, fruit bodies may be formed from the dikaryotic mycelia. These fruit bodies produce peridioles containing the basidia upon which new basidiospores are made. Young basidia contain a pair of haploid <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> nuclei which fuse, and the resulting diploid fusion nucleus undergoes meiosis to produce haploid basidiospores.|$|R
40|$|Introgression {{of genetic}} traits from wild apple {{germplasm}} (Malus spp.) into commercial apple cultivars is a painstakingly slow process. For e. g. introgression of the Vf gene from Malus floribunda 821 for resistance to apple scab, {{caused by the}} fungus Venturia inaequalis, took more than 80 years due to genetic drag and the long juvenile period of apple. In order to speedup the classical breeding, molecular techniques {{can be applied to}} enrich existing commercial apple varieties with functional alleles from <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> plants, preventing genetic drag and keeping the genetic makeup of the commercial cultivar. This concept is named “cisgenesis”. This paper describes several approaches and considerations for development of cisgenic apples and stacking of genes. Also we provide an overview of isolated alleles from apple available for cisgenesis at the moment and in the near futur...|$|R
