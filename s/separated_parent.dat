40|$|A recent {{evaluation}} of the <b>Separated</b> <b>Parent</b> Information Programme (PIP), the first nationally-available court-ordered parent education programme {{to be used in}} the UK in private law cases, found that the programme has limited impact on the amount of contact taking place but no discernable impact on the levels of conflict between parents. In this article two of the researchers involved in the evaluation explore the significance of the findings by examining them in the light of psychological research and in the context of general trends in the family justice system. The article notes that there is a significant gap between the needs of families in conflict and the ability of the PIP to address them. It is argued that this gap can be attributed to certain systematic, longstanding trends in the delivery of family justice which, unless addressed, will continue to stymie progress towards better outcomes for children...|$|E

40|$|Topological defects are {{ubiquitous}} in physics and include crystallographic imperfections such as defects in condensed matter systems. Defects can determine {{many of the}} material’s properties, thus providing novel opportunities for defect engineering. However, {{it is difficult to}} track buried defects and their interfaces in three dimensions with nanoscale resolution. Here, we report three-dimensional visualization of gold nanocrystal twin domains using Bragg coherent X-ray diffractive imaging in an aqueous environment. We capture the size and location of twin domains, which appear as voids in the Bragg electron density, in addition to a component of the strain field. Twin domains can interrupt the stacking order of the parent crystal, leading to a phase offset between the <b>separated</b> <b>parent</b> crystal pieces. We utilize this phase offset to estimate the roughness of the twin boundary. We measure the diffraction signal from the crystal twin and show its Bragg electron density fits into the parent crystal void. Defect imaging will likely facilitate improvement and rational design of nanostructured materials...|$|E

40|$|AbstractJapan's six-century-old Noh theater {{appears on}} UNESCO's list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Noh librettos are {{literary}} works that contain expressions related to proverbs and allude to works written in both kanbun (Chinese) and wabun (Japanese) styles. Whereas Noh specialists {{are apt to}} focus on issues of interest only to other specialists, this study attempts {{to open up a}} new area of research in the hope that it will attract the interest of those in other fields. One more distinctive feature is that the plays investigated include those in and outside the current repertoire, works dating from both the Muromachi (c. 1338 - 1573) and from later periods. Through an investigation of Noh plays concerning parent-child relations, this study finds that the most frequently found expression is the proverb “Parent-child relations last but one lifetime”, or expressions conveying that meaning. They are employed in both sad and happy contexts by both parents and children. The paper argues that in most of these plays the playwrights emphasize the great strength of parent-child relations to the point that, contrary to this proverb, even death cannot break them. There are many plays using this expression {{in the context of a}} parent's grief while traveling in search of a lost child, waiting for his return, or after learning about his death. The paper argues that the expression is more likely to be employed not only to vent the grief of parents, but also to mask their protest against the belief expressed by this proverb. The paper also argues that this protest is more explicit when it is through the voice of mothers. These playwrights seem to be arguing against the proverb, which in full states, “Parent-child relations last but one lifetime. That of husband and wife, two lifetimes. That of lord and vassal, three lifetimes”. Male characters probably could not as easily reveal their weakness or their resistance to the values that feudal society wanted them to follow. In most of the plays using this kind of expression, the <b>separated</b> <b>parent</b> and child are reunited in a happy ending. The reunion in some cases is the result of the parent's travel in search of the child while in some it is due to the miraculous aid from deities. The playwrights may have wanted to propagandize faith in the deities mentioned in those plays...|$|E

40|$|This article contemplates {{whether and}} how court-connected parent {{education}} programs can assist <b>separating</b> <b>parents</b> to access dispute resolution processes that best suit their families’ needs, {{in a manner that}} involves appropriately curtailed levels of state interference with parental autonomy.

However, given current understandings of the appropriate limits on state interference with parental autonomy regarding child-rearing practices, programs aimed specifically at changing parental skills and behaviours should be mandated only on a case-by case basis, where a judge considers such changes necessary...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} {{the mental health}} and parenting practices of a sample of recently <b>separated</b> <b>parents.</b> Study 1 recruited 112 recently separated mothers and fathers, who completed a web-based survey. Results showed that these parents are at higher risk of numerous mental health issues, and were more depressed than the general population. Males experienced more suicidal ideation than females did. As time since separation increased, so wellbeing decreased. Important predictors of poor mental health post-separation were discussed. Recently <b>separated</b> <b>parents</b> did not report more negative or less positive parenting than the general population, but did report lower levels of parenting self-efficacy. Several relationships between predictor and parenting variables are described. Cross-sectional relationships between mental health and parenting variables are also discussed. Study 2 was conducted five months later and 79 % (88) of the parents from Study 1 completed the web based survey for Study 2. Results showed an increase in wellbeing over time {{for both males and}} females. Suicidal ideation decreased over time and this relationship was more pronounced for males than it was for females. Predictors of poor mental health at Time 2 were discussed. The parents‟ parenting self-efficacy increased over time. There were no other changes or sex differences found in parenting practices, but sex differences in parenting circumstances are discussed. This thesis enhances New Zealand research by providing an in-depth analysis of the mental health and parenting practices of recently <b>separated</b> <b>parents.</b> These findings contribute {{to our understanding of the}} circumstances that New Zealand <b>separated</b> <b>parents</b> experience, and the effects that these circumstances can have on the parents...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND While {{there is}} a limited body of {{research}} regarding residential mobility and migration following union dissolution, {{there is a}} particular dearth of studies that go into detail about the factors that shape how union dissolution may result in long-distance migration. OBJECTIVE This research isolates and identifies the processes that influence inter-state migration in the period immediately following the dissolution of a marital union. METHODS Multilevel logit models of the probability of inter-state migration following the dissolution of marital unions are estimated using data drawn from the 1975 through 2011 US Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). RESULTS The results provide support for a gendered model of family migration, indicate that <b>separated</b> <b>parents</b> {{are less likely to}} migrate than ex-partners without children, and suggest that the migration decisions of former partners may remain linked through their children even after the end of their union. CONCLUSIONS These results indicate that the migration of <b>separated</b> <b>parents</b> is constrained by the need for parents with joint or shared children to remain in close geographic proximity to each other. Since both the number of children living with <b>separated</b> <b>parents</b> and the number of those parents with joint or shared custody are increasing, it is likely that this plays some role in the long-term decline in US migration rates...|$|R
