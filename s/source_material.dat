5|$|In the Poetic Edda, {{compiled}} in the 13th century {{from traditional}} <b>source</b> <b>material</b> {{reaching into the}} pagan period, Thor appears (or is mentioned) in the poems Völuspá, Grímnismál, Skírnismál, Hárbarðsljóð, Hymiskviða, Lokasenna, Þrymskviða, Alvíssmál, and Hyndluljóð.|$|E
5|$|The {{paraphrase}} technique {{differs from}} the cantus-firmus technique in that the <b>source</b> <b>material,</b> though it still consists of a monophonic original, is embellished, often with ornaments.

40|$|The {{importance}} of primary <b>source</b> <b>materials</b> to scholarship is undeniable. Primary <b>source</b> <b>materials</b> can verify or contradict information accepted as true in history books and other secondary sources. They {{can tell the}} whole, or at least more complete, story of events. Unlike secondary <b>sources,</b> primary <b>source</b> <b>materials</b> offer first-hand accounts from the past, bringing history closer and making it feel more real. It can even be argued that primary <b>source</b> <b>materials</b> are less susceptible to the loss or misinterpretation of information over time in subsequent edition revisions. In particular among primary <b>source</b> <b>materials,</b> manuscripts such as diaries and letters offer glimpses into history where historic figures are untainted and unskewed by the biographers and scholars who interpret them. Unpublished manuscripts have not usually been censored or edited to reflect modern thoughts, beliefs, or politically correct views the way secondary sources often are. At their best, primary <b>source</b> <b>materials</b> reveal new information about people and events from the past. In the following article, the author will {{tell the story of}} how recently-discovered poems found among Amelia Earhart’s personal papers shed new light into the life of the famous, yet elusive aviator...|$|R

5|$|The sleepwalking {{scene is}} one of the more celebrated scenes from Macbeth, and, indeed, in all of Shakespeare. It has no {{counterpart}} in Holinshed's Chronicles, Shakespeare's <b>source</b> <b>material</b> for the play, but is solely the bard's invention.|$|E
5|$|Almost all the {{surviving}} <b>source</b> <b>material</b> is of questionable reliability. The two witnesses who gave evidence, Robert Stubbs and James Kelsall, were strongly motivated to exonerate themselves from blame. It {{is possible that}} the figures concerning the number of slaves killed, the amount of water that remained on the ship, and the distance beyond Jamaica that Zong had mistakenly sailed are inaccurate.|$|E
5|$|Harmáček began {{creating}} his new cuts in 2010. At the time, he {{was working}} as an English teacher in Plzeň, Czech Republic, and had no professional experience with film editing. Instead, he taught himself as the project progressed, beginning with Photoshop skills that he had developed in college. To remove the post-1977 changes, Harmáček was required {{to go through the}} film frame-by-frame, correcting colors and rotoscoping. Undoing some shots took only an hour, while others took hundreds. Lightsabers were color-corrected, shots of the Millennium Falcon cockpit were cropped, Boba Fett's voice was changed, and CGI characters and backgrounds were removed. Most of the <b>source</b> <b>material</b> used for Harmy's Despecialized Edition was taken from the 2011 Blu-ray release, while other sequences were upscaled from GOUT. To create the cuts, <b>source</b> <b>material</b> was taken from the 2011 Blu-ray releases, HDTV broadcasts of the 2004 DVDs, GOUT, digital broadcasts of the 1997 Special Edition, the 1993 LaserDiscs, digital transfers of a Spanish 35mm Kodak LPP and 70mm film cels, a 16mm print, and still images of the original matte paintings. Harmáček edited these sources together using programs such as Avisynth and Adobe After Effects.|$|E

5|$|In 1070, Su Song {{and a team}} of {{scholars}} compiled and edited the Bencao Tujing ('Illustrated Pharmacopoeia', original <b>source</b> <b>material</b> from 1058–1061), which was a groundbreaking treatise on pharmaceutical botany, zoology, and mineralogy. In compiling information for pharmaceutical knowledge, Su Song worked with such notable scholars as Zhang Yuxi, Lin Yi, Zhang Dong, and many others.|$|E
5|$|Initially the screenwriter {{was to be}} Harold Jack Bloom, {{although}} he was later replaced by Roald Dahl, who had little previous screenwriting experience. You Only Live Twice was the first Bond film to jettison the plot premise of the Fleming <b>source</b> <b>material,</b> although the film retains the title, the Japanese setting, the use of Blofeld as the main villain and a Bond girl named Kissy Suzuki from the novel.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Riley-Smith {{considers}} {{that much of}} the popular understanding of the Crusades derives from the novels of Walter Scott and the French histories by Joseph François Michaud. The Crusades provided an enormous amount of <b>source</b> <b>material,</b> stories of heroism, and interest that underpinned growth in medieval literature, romance, and philosophy.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to offer an {{overview}} of tourism history studies conducted in English and Chinese. The article analyzes three main issues—research themes, <b>source</b> <b>materials,</b> and data analysis methods—for a contrast of literatures in the two languages. No essential difference in the respects of sources and themes is reported because the variances in the two aspects can be accepted as a given. The methods for analyzing <b>source</b> <b>materials,</b> however, are somewhat different in the two cohorts of tourism history research. Based on the analysis of existing literature, the authors have made some concluding comments on the following issues: choice of themes, search for <b>source</b> <b>materials,</b> determination of research scope, and analysis of <b>source</b> <b>materials.</b> The article also points out the implications of English literature on Chinese tourism history research. 本研究旨在概述以两种不同语文-中文和英文-撰写的旅游历史研究，并分析三个主要项目，包括研究主题、材料来源及数据分析方法，以比对中英文文献之异同。研究发现，两者在主题和材料来源方面均没有明显差别，但在分析方法上则有所不同。作者根据对现有文献的分析，就以下问题提出了结论性意见：主题选择、材料搜寻、确定研究范围及材料分析。最后，作者也指出了英文文献对中国旅游历史研究的影响。School of Hotel and Tourism Managemen...|$|R
5|$|King George V visited Ibrox Park in 1917, {{to thank}} Rangers for its {{efforts in the}} First World War. His son, King George VI, opened the 1938 Empire Exhibition with a speech at Ibrox. This was used as <b>source</b> <b>material</b> by Colin Firth for his {{performance}} in The King's Speech movie. Ibrox {{has been used for}} concerts, including performances by Simple Minds (1986 x2), Frank Sinatra (1990), Rod Stewart (1995), Elton John and Billy Joel (1998).|$|E
5|$|Likewise, in Middle English {{and early}} modern Scottish evidence, while still {{appearing}} as causes of harm and danger, elves appear clearly as human-like beings. They became associated with medieval chivalric romance traditions of fairies and {{particularly with the}} idea of a Fairy Queen. A propensity to seduce or rape people becomes increasingly prominent in the <b>source</b> <b>material.</b> Around the fifteenth century, evidence starts to appear for the belief that elves might steal human babies and replace them with changelings.|$|E
5|$|Lithium-6 {{is valued}} as a <b>source</b> <b>material</b> for tritium {{production}} {{and as a}} neutron absorber in nuclear fusion. Natural lithium contains about 7.5% lithium-6 from which large amounts of lithium-6 have been produced by isotope separation for use in nuclear weapons. Lithium-7 gained interest for use in nuclear reactor coolants.|$|E

5|$|Maureen Ryan {{believed}} {{that one of}} the reasons the episode worked so well was because it left out the storylines with the Night's Watch and the Dothraki and focused in a single location. VanDerWerff agreed, and added that with each episode the writers got bolder in the sense that they added new scenes not included in the book to round out the <b>source</b> <b>material.</b>|$|E
5|$|Regarded {{as one of}} the series' strongest Pokémon, {{it changed}} the way players {{approached}} the games by forcing them to find ways to counteract those using Mewtwo. Studies found the character popular with older male children, which contrasted with its counterpart and genetic <b>source</b> <b>material,</b> Mew. Reactions to Mewtwo's first anime portrayal have been divided; reviewers such as Daily Record cited it as a cliché villain, while others such as Animerica and Sight & Sound praised the character's depth.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers were {{consistent}} in their praises and {{criticism of the}} album. They noted the high production values {{and the quality of}} the original compositions and the performance of the orchestra. They also felt that the later tracks in the album were notably weaker than the early tracks, that the arrangements in general did not stray far from the <b>source</b> <b>material,</b> and that several of the track choices did not seem to fit as well as orchestral renditions as others.|$|E

5|$|The {{direct or}} American process starts with diverse {{contaminated}} zinc composites, such as zinc ores or smelter by-products. The zinc precursors are reduced (carbothermal reduction) by heating with {{a source of}} carbon such as anthracite to produce zinc vapor, which is then oxidized as in the indirect process. Because of the lower purity of the <b>source</b> <b>material,</b> the final product is also of lower quality in the direct process {{as compared to the}} indirect one.|$|E
