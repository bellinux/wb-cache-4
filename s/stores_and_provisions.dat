They had a deeper draft than galleys, but considerably shallower draft than traditional sailing warships. The new ship types also increased the archipelago fleet's firepower, provided it with better defensive capabilities, and made possible more efficient fire support in amphibious operations.|$|E

The sleeping berths for the crew were fitted at {{the floor of the}} basket, along with some of <b>stores</b> <b>and</b> <b>provisions.</b> The highly flammable hydrogen meant that cooking could not be done in the basket itself. The solution was a modified primus stove (designed by a friend of Andrée's) that could be dangled 8m (26ft) below the crew and then lit from the basket, at a safe distance. An angled mirror attached to the specially designed stove allowed the crew to determine whether it was successfully lit or not.|$|E
25|$|The Commodore Perry, {{originally}} designed for short operating distances of the Great Lakes, was ill-fitted {{for her new}} duty in the open sea. Vessels on duty in Alaskan waters required ample food storage room, enough to hold six month's <b>stores</b> <b>and</b> <b>provisions,</b> and enough coal-bunker space to cruise actively {{for at least two}} weeks. The Perry was designed to carry only 90 tons. Making room for more coal required <b>stores</b> <b>and</b> <b>provisions</b> to be stored on the deck. Most often, her cruising radius was limited to about 1,500 miles, insufficient to meet the duties demanded of her.|$|E

40|$|In {{the area}} of working with spatial data, in {{addition}} to the classic, two-dimensional geometrical data (maps, aerial images, etc.), the needs for three-dimensional spatial data (city models, digital elevation models, etc.) is increasing. Due to this increased demand the acquiring, <b>storing</b> <b>and</b> <b>provision</b> of 3 D enabled spatial data in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is more and more important. Existing proprietary solutions quickly reaches their limits during data exchange and data delivery to other systems. They generate a large workload, which will be very costly. However, it is noticeable that these expenses and costs can generally be significantly reduced using standards. The aim of this research is therefore to develop a concept in the field of three-dimensional spatial data that runs on existing standards whenever possible. In this research, the military image analysts are the preferred user group of the system. To achieve the objective of the widest possible use of standards in spatial 3 D data, existing standards, proprietary interfaces and standards under discussion have been analyzed. Since the here used GIS of the Fraunhofer IOSB is already using and supporting OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) and NATO-STANAG (NATO-Standardization Agreement) standards for the most part of it, a special attention for possible use was laid on their standards. The most promising standard is the OGC standard 3 DPS (3 D Portrayal Service) with its occurrences W 3 DS (Web 3 D Service) and WVS (Web View Service). A demo system was created, using a standardized workflow from the data acquiring, <b>storing</b> <b>and</b> <b>provision</b> <b>and</b> showing the benefit of our approach...|$|R

Some of them as intruders by deploying the security attacks like denial of service or hack the information. So we introduced a framework which contains agents on every Peer and they monitor every Peer to maintain confidentiality, anonymous etc. The main goals of these methods are to maintain privacy of private data. So we additionally introduced a classifier to predict that connected Peer is secure or then proceed to share data. Internet privacy refers as the right of self-privacy regards to the <b>storing</b> <b>and</b> <b>provision</b> to other parties and showing of information to oneself through the Internet...|$|R

25|$|Believing that Louis XIV {{was only}} {{stalling}} for {{time in order}} to recuperate his army, the ministry in London prepared to act vigorously on all fronts in 1709, hoping to draw the French back to the negotiating table. Central to both sides was the situation in Flanders. Here, Villars replaced Vendôme as commander of the French army and set about building a new defensive line from Aire to Douai (the Lines of Cambrin, or la Bassée, later extended) to block the line of advance from Lille to Paris. Due to the harshness of the previous winter and the scarcity of <b>stores</b> <b>and</b> <b>provisions,</b> Marlborough had initially recoiled from a full-scale invasion of France in preference to a conservative policy of siege warfare. The Allies invested Tournai in July (the citadel did not fall till 3 September), before moving to attack Mons. Given a free hand from Louis XIV to save the city Villars, commanding perhaps 75,000 men, entrenched his army centred around the tiny village of Malplaquet. Confident that one last set-piece battle would result in the final destruction of the main French army and force Louis XIV to accept peace on Allied terms, Marlborough and Eugene, leading some 86,000 men, accepted the challenge and attacked the French position on 11 September. The Battle of Malplaquet was nominally a victory for the Allies, but a stern French defence and faults in the execution of the battle-plan prevented the Allies from winning decisively, and they suffered major losses. Although Mons subsequently fell in October, Villars and his co-commander Boufflers, had kept the French army intact.|$|E

40|$|With an {{explosive}} {{growth in the}} popularity of social media and increasing prevalence and features of advanced mobile devices, interest has grown significantly in applications that are aware of users' social context {{and are able to}} assist them in their daily activities. A key requirement of developing social context-aware applications is the platform support to reduce the complexity of engineering such applications. In this chapter, the authors present such a platform, namely SocioPlatform, to aid the development of social context-aware applications by acquiring, reasoning, <b>storing</b> <b>and</b> <b>provisioning</b> different types of social context information, and managing their runtime interactions and adaptation. The platform hides the complexity of managing social context, and thus assists the development of social context-aware applications. The authors demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the platform by developing two different types of such applications...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} a novel framework to address challenges in developing socially-aware applications. The framework includes {{an approach to}} model, represent, reason about, and manage different types of social context, and a platform for acquiring, <b>storing,</b> <b>provisioning</b> <b>and</b> managing social context information to aid the development of socially-aware applications. This thesis makes several important research contributions. Firstly, the proposed framework provides an ontology-based social context model, including an upper social context ontology which can be customised and specialised to form domain-specific ontologies. Secondly, the iii framework provides an ontology-based approach to define rules for deriving, deducing and abstracting social context information. It also propose an approach to inferring users’ situations by correlating historical interaction events. Thirdly, the framework provides an ontology-based socially-aware access control policy model and language for owners to control access to their information {{at different levels of}} granularity. Fourthly, the framework also provides a way to model and represent runtime social interactions from both the domain- and player-perspectives to support mediated social interactions, and manage their adaptation to cope with the changes in user requirements and environments. Finally, the framework provides a platform for acquiring, <b>storing</b> <b>and</b> <b>provisioning</b> social context information, executing social interaction models and managing their runtime adaptation...|$|R
500|$|Markham {{had hoped}} for a {{fully-fledged}} Royal Naval expedition, but was warned by the Admiralty that [...] "the present exigencies of the Naval Service [...] prevent them from lending officers..." [...] However, the Admiralty agreed to release Scott and Charles Royds, and later allowed Michael Barne and Reginald Skelton to join the expedition. The remaining officers were from the Merchant Marine, including Albert Armitage, the second-in-command, who had experience with the Jackson–Harmsworth Arctic expedition, 1894–97, and Ernest Shackleton, designated Third Officer in charge of holds, <b>stores</b> <b>and</b> <b>provisions,</b> and responsible for arranging the entertainments. The Admiralty also released around twenty petty officers and seamen, {{the rest of the}} crew being from the merchant service, or from civilian employment. Among the lower deck complement were some who became Antarctic veterans, including Frank Wild, William Lashly, Thomas Crean (who joined the expedition following the desertion of a seaman in New Zealand), Edgar Evans and Ernest Joyce. Although the expedition was not a formal Navy project, Scott proposed to run the expedition on naval lines, and secured the crew's voluntary agreement to work under the Naval Discipline Act.|$|E
