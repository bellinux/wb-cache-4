40|$|In this study, a novel slurry {{injection}} system (SIS) was installed on an Ebara F-REX 200 polisher and its performance was analyzed for oxide {{chemical mechanical planarization}} process. The <b>slurry</b> <b>injector</b> contacts the pad with a light load and applies slurry in a thin layer at the device trailing edge using single or multiple injection points. Used slurry, rinse water and pad debris are then removed from the pad by the injector leading edge. Blanket 200 -mm oxide wafers were polished using Cabot Microelectronics Corporation Semi-Sperse ™ 25 slurry at different flow rates (100, 150 and 200 ml/min) on Dow IC 1000 ™ k-groove and XY-perforated pads. The results show that at each flow rate, the oxide removal rate is enhanced sufficiently over the rate from the standard slurry applicator that the flow rate can be reduced by about 35 % on the XY-perforated pad and 50 % on the k-groove pad without sacrificing removal rate...|$|E
40|$|Shallow {{injection}} of slurry on grassland can reduce ammonia emissions compared to surface spreading and increase plant nitrogen utilisation. Other advantages include enhanced silage quality and lower odour. Disadvantages include higher investment costs, increased draught requirements and potential crop damage. The {{objective of this}} thesis was to determine appropriate techniques for slurry injection into ley that would minimise ammonia emissions, contamination of crops and energy inputs, while resulting in high plant utilisation of slurry nitrogen. <b>Slurry</b> <b>injector</b> performance was validated in field trials. Conventional slurry tankers with different types of injectors were used to shallow-inject (less than 0. 05 m) slurry into open slots after the first cut. Slurry placement after spreading, ammonia volatilisation, yield and crop nitrogen uptake were measured and compared {{to the results of}} band spreading. In the first year, silage quality and an economic analysis were also included. Only one injector, with double disc tines, could place the slurry below the soil surface in all three soils tested. Ammonia release was on average 39 % of the total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) applied, half the level with band spreading, but this did not result in higher dry matter (DM) yield o...|$|E
40|$|Injection depth has an {{important}} impact {{on the performance of}} a shallow manure injection system. Therefore, it should be maintained within narrow margins. For this purpose, an automatic electro-hydraulic depth control system was developed, which minimises the difference between the actual injection, measured by means of an ultrasonic sensor, and the desired injection depth. To minimise this difference the relative position of the shallow <b>slurry</b> <b>injector</b> attached to the four-point linkage at the back of a manure tanker was changed with respect to this tanker. A grey box model was developed for the conversion of the voltage applied to an electronic control unit into the working depth of a shallow manure injector. A simplified and linearised model based on theoretical considerations was developed. The parameters of this model were estimated by means of frequency-domain identification techniques. This model contained all the dominant dynamics of the system that are relevant for control design. Since the dynamics of the system change during manure application, the worst case with respect to the stability of the depth control system was sought by comparing several extreme situations. The case of an empty tanker with the injector above the ground (minimal soil penetration resistance) was found to be the worst case and the model parameters were determined for this case. The resulting model contains an integrator and is of second order in the numerator, and fourth order in the denominator. Along with the non-linear time delay effect this model was found to be suitable for a model-based design of a stable and accurate injection depth controller. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{splash plate}} slurry {{spreader}} is inexpensive and robust {{but it is}} not environmentally friendly. It releases most of the ammonia (NH 3) in slurry, emits strong odours and distributes the remaining nutrients unevenly. The object of this report is to identify improvements to slurry spreaders that may eliminate these shortcomings. Several gases are released during and after slurry spreading. NH 3 contributes to acidification of the environment and is emitted almost entirely from agriculture. Over 30 % of European NH 3 emissions come from slurry spreading. The Gothenberg agreement (UNECE, 1999) requires a reduction in national NH 3 emission to 8 % below 1990 levels. Emission of this gas from band, TF (trailing foot) and <b>injector</b> <b>slurry</b> spreaders is 40, 40 and 20 % respectively of that from conventional splash plate machines. A switch to spreaders with lower emissions would provide sufficient reduction to satisfy the Gothenberg objective. Odour from livestock units gives rise to many complaints but {{there is little evidence that}} it is a health hazard. Emission of the vapours from slurry spreaders is in the order; (splash plate) >(band) > (TF and injector). Other gases (methane and nitrous oxide) are released primarily after injection. Infection of humans by slurry-borne organisms is not common. In general the differences between spreaders in regard to pathogens are not significant but this conclusion may not apply in all cases. Slurry nutrients amount to 40 % of the N and 65 % of the P required in agriculture. Several commercial and experimental methods exist to measure slurry nutrient content. Field application using a splash plate and vacuum tanker gives highly variable distribution. Any of the other spreaders reviewed here combined with a fixed displacement pump achieve more uniform application. Accurate spreading reduces the need for excess application so losses to water from soil are reduced. This conforms to the Water Framework Directive. Deep injection and incorporation can reduce loss of P from slurry but other spreading methods will not normally reduce the risk of P loss at spreading time. The proposed tanker consists of a closed tank with running gear fit for road and field conditions. A TF spreader is fitted at the back. The slurry is handled by a fixed displacement pump which fills the tank or empties it through the spreader. The pump must be protected from obstacles so an intake filter or chopper filter should be included. This slurry spreader would reduce emission of NH 3 and odour and increase the recycling of slurry nutrients to crops. It is more expensive than splash plate machines but if widely adopted it could be an economical solution to the UNECE requirement to reduce NH 3 emissions. Alternatives to improving spreaders exist. These include digesting slurry, and reducing emissions from livestock housing and slurry storage. With the exception of digestion these offer poor prospects of success especially in relation to odour reduction and exploitation of slurry nutrients. The cost of providing this equipment on Irish farms is likely to be between € 200 m and € 800 m and depends on the options chosen. End of Project Repor...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} series of studies relating to optimization of kinematics and consumables during chemical mechanical planarization processes. These are also evaluated with the purpose of minimizing environmental and cost of ownership impacts. In order to study diamond micro-wear and substrate wear during planarization processes, {{a series of}} static etch tests and wear tests were performed using different types of diamond discs and subjected to various treatments. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Membrane Spectroscopy (ICPMS) were used to estimate the extent of diamond micro-wear and substrate wear. Next, the impact of various factors (type of slurry abrasive, pH, abrasive content and abrasive concentration) on pad wear rate during planarization process was studied. Another study in this dissertation focuses on the development of a novel technique of using coefficient of friction (COF) data to distinguish between good and bad diamond discs. This study made use of the innovative tool diamond disc dragging device (DDD- 100) designed and developed {{for the purpose of this}} study. It is known that the performance of chemical mechanical planarization depends significantly on the polishing pad grooving type and the kinematics involved in the process. Variations in pad grooving type as well as pressure and sliding velocity can affect polishing performance. One study in this dissertation investigates the effect of pressure and sliding velocity on the polishing performance. The study is conducted on multiple pressure and sliding velocity variations to understand the characteristic of each condition. A subsequent study focuses on the impact of pad grooving type on polishing performance. The greatest contribution of this dissertation involves development of the novel <b>slurry</b> <b>injector</b> to optimize the utilization of slurry during planarization processes. Slurry is a critical component in chemical mechanical planarization processes and accounts for approximately 50 percent of the cost of ownership (CoO). The novel injector apart from reducing the consumption of slurry, also contributed in addressing problems associated with foaming, reduced the number of defects and achieved better within wafer non-uniformity (WIWNU) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} series of studies related to the study and control of slurry flow, process temperature, and aggressive diamonds in Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP). The purpose of these studies is to better understand the fundamentals of CMP and to explore solutions to some of CMP’s greatest challenges. Within-wafer removal rate non-uniformity (WIWRRNU) is a critical parameter to determine film thickness planarity on a wafer-scale level and it grossly impacts yield. Resolving this issue continues to be an area of intense focus in the industry. The first study in this dissertation shows the feasibility of adopting a new method to improve WIWRRNU during copper CMP that is solely based on intentional local temperature manipulation of the pad. A pad surface thermal management system is developed to locally change pad surface temperature. This system consists of one or more thermal transfer modules contacting the pad surface. In this study, the system is employed to adjust the "center-fast" copper removal rate profile to illustrate its effect during the process. Results shows that, when two thermal transfer modules are employed, local removal rates in the wafer center region decrease significantly while maintaining the removal rates near the wafer edge thereby significantly improving WIWRRNU. Another contribution of this dissertation is the investigation of the effect of pad groove design on slurry injection scheme during interlayer dielectric CMP. A novel <b>slurry</b> <b>injector</b> with multiple slurry outlets is designed, which provides optional slurry injection schemes (i. e. one injection point scheme and multi-injection point scheme). These schemes are compared with the standard slurry application method on a concentrically grooved pad and an xy-groove pad, respectively. On the concentrically grooved pad, the one injection point scheme generates significantly higher oxide removal rates (ranging from 22 to 35 percent) compared to the standard slurry application method at different slurry flow rates. On the xy-groove pad, the one injection point scheme still results in higher removal rates (ranging from 3 to 9 percent), however, its removal rate enhancement is not as high as that of the concentrically grooved pad. In order to further improve slurry availability on the xy-groove pad, the multi-injection point scheme is tested. Results show that the multi-injection point scheme results in significantly higher removal rates (ranging from 17 to 20 percent) compared to the standard slurry application method. This work underscores the importance of optimum slurry injection schemes for accommodating particular groove designs. The last contribution of this dissertation involves a study regarding aggressive diamond characterization and wear analysis during CMP. A 3 M A 3700 diamond disk is used to condition a Cabot Microelectronics Corporation (CMC) D 100 pad for 30 hours. The top 20 aggressive diamonds for two perpendicular disk orientations are identified before the polishing, as well as after 15 - and 30 -hour polishing. The furrow surface area generated by these top 20 aggressive diamonds and their evolution are analyzed and compared. Results show that the original top 20 aggressive diamonds identified before polishing are subjected to wear after the first 15 -hour polishing as the furrow surface area that they generate decreases dramatically (by 47 %). As these original aggressive diamonds are worn, seven new aggressive diamonds are "born" and join the new top 20 list for both disk orientations. After the second 15 -hour wafer polishing, the furrow surface area of these new top 20 aggressive diamonds do not change significantly. The furrow surface area created by all the active diamonds exhibits the same trend as the top 20 aggressive diamonds, confirming that most pad conditioning work is performed by these aggressive diamonds and that the disk loses its aggressiveness in the first 15 hours of polishing and then maintains its aggressiveness during the second 15 hours, albeit to a lesser extent...|$|E
