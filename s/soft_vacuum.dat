40|$|The {{development}} of a cryogenic insulation system for operation under <b>soft</b> <b>vacuum</b> is presented in this paper. Conventional insulation materials for cryogenic applications {{can be divided into}} three levels of thermal performance, in terms of apparent thermal conductivity [k-value in milliwatt per meter-kelvin (mW/m-K) ]. System k-values below 0. 1 can be achieved for multilayer insulation operating at a vacuum level below 1 x 10 (exp - 4) torr. For fiberglass or powder operating below 1 x 10 (exp - 3) torr, k-values of about 2 are obtained. For foam and other materials at ambient pressure, k-values around 30 are typical. New industry and aerospace applications require a versatile, robust, low-cost thermal insulation with performance in the intermediate range. The target for the new composite insulation system is a k-value below 4. 8 mW/m-K (R- 30) at a <b>soft</b> <b>vacuum</b> level (from 1 to 10 torr) and boundary temperatures of approximately 77 and 293 kelvin (K). Many combinations of radiation shields, spacers, and composite materials were tested from high vacuum to ambient pressure using cryostat boiloff methods. Significant improvement over conventional systems in the <b>soft</b> <b>vacuum</b> range was demonstrated. The new layered composite insulation system was also shown to provide key benefits for high vacuum applications as well...|$|E

40|$|A unique {{research}} program, {{including a}} {{comprehensive study of}} thermal performance at cryogenic vacuum insulation systems, was performed at the NASA Kennedy Space Center. The main goal {{was to develop a}} new <b>soft</b> <b>vacuum</b> system (from 1 torr to 10 torr) that provides an intermediate level of performance (k-value below 4. 8 mW/m-K). Liquid nitrogen boil-off methods were used to test conventional materials, novel materials, and certain combinations. The test articles included combinations of aluminum foil, fiberglass paper, polyester fabric, silica aerogel composite blanket, fumed silica, silica aerogel powder, and syntactic foam. A new LCI system was developed at the Cryogenics Test Laboratory. This system performs exceptionally well at <b>soft</b> <b>vacuum</b> levels and nearly as good as an MLI at high vacuum levels. Apparent thermal conductivities for the LCI range from 2 mW/m-K at <b>soft</b> <b>vacuum</b> to 0. 1 mW/m-K at high vacuum. Several cryostats were designed, constructed, and calibrated by the Cryogenics Test Laboratory at KSC NASA as part of this research program. The cryostat test apparatus is a liquid nitrogen boil-off calorimeter system for direct measurement of the apparent thermal conductivity at a fixed vacuum level between 5 x 10 (exp - 5) and 760 torr. The apparatus is also used for transient measurements of temperature profiles.

Several different concepts of operation may be employed to liquefy the propellants based on how and where these two technologies are implemented. The concepts that were investigated include: using an accumulator tank to store the propellant until it is needed, liquefying in the flow stream going into the tank, and liquefying in the flight propellant tank itself. The different concept of operations were studied to assess the mass and power impacts of each concept.

After examining the test construction results, it was evident that the ratio of increments of the undrained shear strength to increments of the effective stress (△Cu / △σv’) in the peat layer to which the vacuum consolidation method was applied had a higher value than that of the peat layer to which no countermeasure was applied.

40|$|New {{requirements}} for thermal insulation include robust Multilayer insulation (MU) systems {{that work for}} a range of environments from high vacuum to no vacuum. Improved MLI systems must be simple to install and maintain while meeting the life-cycle cost and thermal performance objectives. Performance of actual MLI systems has been previously shown to be much worse than ideal MLI. Spacecraft that must contain cryogens for both lunar service (high vacuum) and ground launch operations (no vacuum) are planned. Future cryogenic spacecraft for the <b>soft</b> <b>vacuum</b> environment of Mars are also envisioned. Industry products using robust MLI can benefit from improved cost-efficiency and system safety. Novel materials have been developed to operate as excellent thermal insulators at vacuum levels that are much less stringent than the absolute high vacuum requirement of current MLI systems. One such robust system, Layered Composite Insulation (LCI), has been developed by the Cryogenics Test Laboratory at NASA Kennedy Space Center. The experimental testing and development of LCI is the focus of this paper. LCI thermal performance under cryogenic conditions is shown to be six times better than MLI at <b>soft</b> <b>vacuum</b> and similar to MLI at high vacuum.

40|$|Improved thermal-insulation {{materials}} and structures and the techniques for manufacturing them are undergoing development {{for use in}} low-temperature applications. Examples of low-temperature equipment for which these thermal insulation systems could provide improved energy efficiency include storage tanks for cryogens, superconducting electric-power-transmission equipment, containers for transport of food and other perishable commodities, and cold boxes for low-temperature industrial processes. These systems {{could also be used}} to insulate piping used to transfer cryogens and other fluids, such as liquefied natural gas, refrigerants, chilled water, crude oil, or low-pressure steam. The present thermal-insulation systems are layer composites based partly on the older class of thermal-insulation systems denoted generally as multilayer insulation (MLI). A typical MLI structure includes an evacuated jacket, within which many layers of radiation shields are stacked or wrapped close together. Low-thermal-conductivity spacers are typically placed between the reflection layers to keep them from touching. MLI can work very well when a high vacuum level (less than 10 (exp- 4) torr) is maintained and utmost care is taken during installation, but its thermal performance deteriorates sharply as the pressure in the evacuated space rises into the <b>soft</b> <b>vacuum</b> range [pressures greater than 0. 1 torr (greater than 13 Pa) ]. In addition, the thermal performance of MLI is extremely sensitive to mechanical compression and edge effects and can easily decrease from one to two orders of magnitude from its ideal value even when the MLI is kept under high vacuum condition. The present thermal-insulation systems are designed to perform well under <b>soft</b> <b>vacuum</b> level, in particular the range of 1 to 10 torr. They are also designed with larger interlayer spacings to reduce vulnerability to compression (and consequent heat leak) caused by installation and use.

The surface cleaning is generally performed with a low-suction <b>vacuum,</b> <b>soft</b> brushes, mild detergent and soft sponges. Cleanings are important for removing any dirt, grime, grease, pollution or dust from the pole’s surface. It is recommended by conservators to start at the top and work your way down. Scaffolding or a lift is used with taller poles.|$|R
40|$|The {{conditions}} of the chemical bath deposition CBD and post annealing for the buffer layers of ZnO Zn S,O Cu In,Ga S,Se 2 type solar cells have a strong impact on their efficiency 1 8. Although the Zn S,O buffer {{has proven to be}} an adequate replacement for the commonly used CdS 10 13, the nature of its electronic structure is not yet fully known. The CBD process of Zn S,O was shown {{to be sensitive to the}} solution chemistry. Moreover, annealing of the Zn S,O Cu In,Ga S,Se 2 stack in air up to 200 C is necessary to maximise the efficiency. 1, 7, 8 However, the lack of understanding these processes impedes further systematic improvements of the chalcopyrite solar cells efficiency. Here we show that bridging the gap between high <b>vacuum</b> <b>soft</b> X ray spectroscopes and the real system under ambient conditions 16, 17 allowed us to extend the applicability of soft X ray absorption spectroscopy to probe chemical reactions in situ during the CBD and annealing processes. The observed difference in cell efficiencies depending on CBD process conditions is due to the drastically different solution chemistry as shown by differences in the electronic structure of intermediates in solution and in the the final product depending on the mixing order of the chemicals involve...|$|R
