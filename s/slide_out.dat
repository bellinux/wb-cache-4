5|$|In 1913, Chevalier Jackson was {{the first}} to report a high rate of success for the use of direct {{laryngoscopy}} as a means to intubate the trachea. Jackson introduced a new laryngoscope blade that incorporated a component that the operator could <b>slide</b> <b>out</b> to allow room for passage of an endotracheal tube or bronchoscope. Also in 1913, New York surgeon Henry H. Janeway (1873–1921) published results he had achieved using a laryngoscope he had recently developed. Another pioneer in this field was Sir Ivan Whiteside Magill (1888–1986), who developed the technique of awake blind nasotracheal intubation, the Magill forceps, the Magill laryngoscope blade, and several apparati for the administration of volatile anesthetic agents. The Magill curve of an endotracheal tube is also named for Magill. Sir Robert Reynolds Macintosh (1897–1989) introduced a curved laryngoscope blade in 1943; the Macintosh blade remains to this day the most widely used laryngoscope blade for orotracheal intubation.|$|E
5|$|The two tiered mosque has a {{rectangular}} plan. The Ottoman prayer hall faces towards the south. It has a flat paved roof topped with 27 sliding domes on square bases. Holes pierced {{into the base}} of each dome illuminate the interior. The roof is also used for prayer during peak times, when the domes <b>slide</b> <b>out</b> on metal tracks to shade areas of the roof, creating light wells for the prayer hall. At these times, {{the courtyard of the}} Ottoman mosque is also shaded with umbrellas affixed to freestanding columns. The roof is accessed by stairs and escalators. The paved area around the mosque is also used for prayer, equipped with umbrella tents. Sliding Domes and retractable umbrella-like canopies are designed by the German architect Mahmoud Bodo Rasch and his firm SL Rasch GmbH and Buro Happold.|$|E
5|$|Ovine {{obstetrics}} can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing. However, it {{is a myth}} that sheep cannot lamb without human assistance; many ewes give birth directly in pasture without aid. This can be proven {{by the fact that}} they give birth in the wild. Balancing ease of lambing with high productivity is one of the dilemmas of sheep breeding. While the majority of births are relatively normal and do not require intervention, many complications may arise. A lamb may present in the normal fashion (with both legs and head forward), but may simply be too large to <b>slide</b> <b>out</b> of the birth canal. This often happens when large rams are crossed with diminutive ewes (this is related to breed, rams are naturally larger than ewes by comparison). Lambs may also present themselves with one shoulder to the side, completely backward, or with only some of their limbs protruding. Lambs may also be spontaneously aborted or stillborn. Reproductive failure is a common consequence of infections such as toxoplasmosis and foot-and-mouth disease. Some types of abortion in sheep are preventable by vaccinations against these infections.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the major}} {{differences}} between the classic Mac OS and the current macOS was the addition of Aqua, a graphical user interface with water-like elements, in the first major release of Mac OS X. Every window element, text, graphic, or widget is drawn on-screen using spatial anti-aliasing technology. ColorSync, a technology introduced many years before, was improved and built into the core drawing engine, to provide color matching for printing and multimedia professionals. Also, drop shadows were added around windows and isolated text elements to {{provide a sense of}} depth. New interface elements were integrated, including sheets (dialog boxes attached to specific windows) and drawers, which would <b>slide</b> <b>out</b> and provide options.|$|E
25|$|Until 1913, {{oral and}} maxillofacial surgery was {{performed}} by mask inhalation anesthesia, topical application of local anesthetics to the mucosa, rectal anesthesia, or intravenous anesthesia. While otherwise effective, these techniques did not protect the airway from obstruction and also exposed patients {{to the risk of}} pulmonary aspiration of blood and mucus into the tracheobronchial tree. In 1913, Chevalier Jackson (1865–1958) was the first to report a high rate of success for the use of direct laryngoscopy as a means to intubate the trachea. Jackson introduced a new laryngoscope blade that had a light source at the distal tip, rather than the proximal light source used by Kirstein. This new blade incorporated a component that the operator could <b>slide</b> <b>out</b> to allow room for passage of an endotracheal tube or bronchoscope.|$|E

25|$|Phineas and Ferb: The Best LIVE Tour Ever was a touring two-act {{stage of}} the TV show. A {{projection}} system played video in the same style as the TV show on {{the rear of the}} stage; the characters were first introduced there in their cartoon forms, but then used a backyard slide that continued into a physical <b>slide</b> <b>out</b> of which the live cast members emerged into the real world. The performers wore prosthetics to make their characters resemble their cartoon counterparts-- mostly head pieces, but a full body suit in the cases of Buford and Perry. The 2011-2012 season of the tour began on August 21, 2011 in Lakeland, Florida and ended on April 22, 2012 in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The 2012-2013 season began on August 23, 2012 in Wheeling, West Virginia and ran until February 18, 2013 in Chattanooga, Tennessee.|$|E
25|$|The jacket harness is a {{waistcoat}} (vest) style garment {{with strong}} adjustable webbing straps which are adjustable and securely buckled over the shoulders, across {{the chest and}} waist, and through the crotch or around each thigh, so that the diver can not <b>slide</b> <b>out</b> under any predictable circumstance. The harness is fitted with several heavy duty D-rings, fixed to the webbing {{in such a way}} that the full weight of the diver and all his equipment can be safely supported. A minimum strength of 500kgf is recommended or required by some codes of practice. A jacket harness is usually provided with webbing straps or a cloth pocket on the back to support the bailout cylinder, and may have a variety of pockets to carry tools, and may also carry ditchable or fixed main weights. There are usually several strong D-rings to secure the umbilical and other equipment.|$|E
500|$|The drill removes {{an annulus}} of ice around the core {{but does not}} cut under it. A {{spring-loaded}} lever arm called a core dog can break off the core and hold it in place while it is brought to the surface. [...] The core is then extracted from the drill barrel, usually by laying it out flat so that the core can <b>slide</b> <b>out</b> onto a prepared surface. [...] The core must be cleaned of drilling fluid as it is slid out; for the WAIS Divide coring project, a vacuuming system {{was set up to}} facilitate this. [...] The surface that receives the core should be aligned as accurately as possible with the drill barrel to minimise mechanical stress on the core, which can easily break. [...] The ambient temperature is kept well below freezing to avoid thermal shock.|$|E

[...] To preserve the stairwell's appearance and function while still conforming to modern safety standards, an innovative automated fire protection system was installed which would <b>slide</b> <b>out</b> and close protective fire doors from concealed storage areas on each floor, effectively sealing the stairwell off.|$|E
2500|$|A sliding knife is a knife {{that can}} be opened by sliding the knife blade out {{the front of the}} handle. One method of opening is where the blade exits out the front of the handle point-first and then is locked into place (an example of this is the gravity knife). Another form is an O-T-F (out-the-front) switchblade, which only {{requires}} the push of a button or spring to cause the blade to <b>slide</b> <b>out</b> of the handle and lock into place. To retract the blade back into the handle, a release lever or button, usually the same control as to open, is pressed. [...] A very common form of sliding knife is the sliding utility knife (commonly known as a stanley knife or boxcutter).|$|E

2500|$|Each {{track is}} {{different}} and range from standard ovals to tracks with many twists and turns. The game includes many obstacles, such as oil slicks that send players spinning, puddles of water that cause players to <b>slide</b> <b>out</b> of control, sand traps and [...] "slow cones" [...] that slow players down, large cones that bring players to a complete halt, and walls of tires that players bounce off. If a player hits an oil slick and then hits a wall while spinning, the player's car is temporarily destroyed, which loses time. The tracks also has items that help players along the way: [...] "zippers" [...] (a series of chevrons on the track) give players a speed boost, roll cages allow players to hit walls without being destroyed {{and allow them to}} crash opponents by forcing them into walls, and missiles and bombs temporarily destroy opponents' cars. Also on the track are spare parts which help improve performancetires improve traction, batteries increase acceleration, and engines improve speed.|$|E
