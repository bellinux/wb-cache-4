5|$|According to Larousse Gastronomique, the durian {{fruit is}} ready to eat when its husk begins to crack. However, the ideal stage of {{ripeness}} to be enjoyed varies from region to region in Southeast Asia and by species. Some species grow <b>so</b> <b>tall</b> that they can only be collected once they have fallen to the ground, whereas most cultivars of D. zibethinus are nearly always cut from the tree and allowed to ripen while waiting to be sold. Some people in southern Thailand prefer their durians relatively young when the clusters of fruit within the shell are still crisp in texture and mild in flavour. For some people in northern Thailand, the preference is for the fruit to be soft and aromatic. In Malaysia and Singapore, most consumers prefer the fruit to be as ripe and pungent in aroma as possible and may even risk allowing the fruit to continue ripening after its husk has already cracked open. In this state, the flesh becomes richly creamy, slightly alcoholic, the aroma pronounced and the flavour highly complex.|$|E
5|$|Australian ravens begin {{breeding}} {{once they}} are three years old. Breeding season is from July to September, with no substantial difference in timing across its range around the country despite it inhabiting a range of diverse climates and habitats across 19 degrees of latitude. Rowley has pointed out this is unusual for a bird species {{with a wide range}} and has postulated that breeding is initiated by day length. Rarely, breeding can take place in May, June or October. Australian ravens generally nest in tall trees, never near to the ground as some species do. The nest also functions as a lookout post and <b>so</b> <b>tall</b> or emergent trees are selected. The ravens occasionally nest on buildings, telegraph poles, or tall windmills which allow the species to occupy areas lacking in tall trees. Windmills may have assisted the spread of the species in North Queensland and the Northern Territory. The highest recorded corvid nest in Australia was found atop the AWA Tower in Sydney.|$|E

One merchant commissioned a chamber-pot made of gold which was <b>so</b> <b>tall</b> that he had to climb a ladder to use it.

25|$|The four {{travelers}} {{continue their}} journey until midday. They find themselves facing a massive castle {{in an open}} area. The castle is <b>so</b> <b>tall</b> that they must bend their heads back to their spines to see above it. At {{the entrance to the}} castle is a shut gate, and Thor finds that he cannot open it. Struggling, all four squeeze through the bars of the gate, and continue to a large hall. Inside the great hall are two benches, where many generally large people sit on two benches. The four see Útgarða-Loki, the king of the castle, sitting.|$|E
25|$|Broadcast 1 February 1995, {{this episode}} {{examines}} how plants either share environments harmoniously or compete for dominance within them. Attenborough highlights the 1987 storm and the devastation it caused. However, for some species, {{it was that}} opportunity for which they had lain dormant for many years. The space left by uprooted trees is soon filled by others who move relatively swiftly towards the light. The oak {{is one of the}} strongest and longest-lived, and other, lesser plants nearby must wait until the spring to flourish before the light above is extinguished by leaves. Tropical forests are green throughout the year, so brute force is needed for a successful climb {{to the top of the}} canopy: the rattan is an example that has the longest stem of any plant. As its name suggests, the strangler fig 'throttles' its host by growing around it and cutting off essential water and light. Some can take advantage of a fallen tree by setting down roots on the now horizontal trunk and getting nutriment from the surrounding moss and the fungi on the dead bark. The mountain ash (eucalyptus regnans) grows <b>so</b> <b>tall,</b> that regeneration becomes a considerable problem. It is easily flammable, so its solution is to shed its seeds during a forest fire and sacrifice itself. It therefore relies on the periodic near-destruction of its surroundings in order to survive. Attenborough observes that catastrophes such as fire and drought, while initially detrimental to wildlife, eventually allow for deserted habitats to be reborn.|$|E

500|$|Ponche de Leona {{delivered}} Mucho Macho Man {{three weeks}} after her due date. [...] At birth, the foal was lifeless with no heartbeat. Farm staff tried to revive him by massaging and shaking him. [...] He was unresponsive for several minutes, then his eyes opened and he [...] "just got up and galloped away". As a result, his foalhood nickname was [...] "Lazarus". [...] In {{addition to being a}} late foal, he was very big and hence slow to reach full development. Because the young horse was <b>so</b> <b>tall</b> and skinny, John Rio called him [...] "Mr. Green Jeans", though no one else did. [...] His official name is derived from the Village People song [...] "Macho Man", and owner Dean Reeves' nickname for him is [...] "Macho".|$|E

500|$|Okafor's father, Chukwudi, {{known as}} Chuck, is of Nigerian Igbo and African-American descent, and his mother, Dacresha Lanett Benton, is African-American and White. As a youth, Okafor split time between his mother's {{home in the}} 127-resident town of Moffett, Oklahoma and his father's home in Chicago. When he was 9 years old, his mother {{contracted}} bronchitis and died two weeks later from a collapsed lung. Okafor permanently moved in with his father to the South Side of Chicago and then to Rosemont. Okafor attended Rosemont Elementary.

500|$|Weather {{within the}} Wilderness varies {{due to the}} {{mountains}} acting as a barrier for both weather and temperature. The Cascade Range mountains prevent wet storms from moving, forcing air to rise and then cool. This cooling air cannot hold as much moisture, causing heavy precipitation (up to [...] in rainfall annually) on the western flanks of the mountains, which leads to extensive forestation. Snowfall typically totals more than [...] annually, amounting to snow still being present as late as July or August. In warmer months, melted snow runs off into lakes, keeping them especially full. Because the mountains are <b>so</b> <b>tall,</b> storm clouds may get stuck even {{as the rest of}} the storm moves onward, leading to snowstorms and freezing temperatures year-round. In extreme conditions, these storm cells might endanger hikers by means of strong winds, fog, snow, and rain that can potentially make hiking nearly impossible. On the eastern sides of the mountains, air warms as it drops, producing Chinook winds, considerably lower precipitation, and less forested landscapes. Because of these conditions, temperatures on the western sides of mountains are steady, whereas temperatures on the eastern flanks fluctuate wildly.|$|E

2500|$|At {{one time}} Wren was {{credited}} with {{the design of the}} King's House at Newmarket, Suffolk. The attribution gave rise to an apocryphal story in which Charles II, who was over six feet tall, complained about the low ceilings.
