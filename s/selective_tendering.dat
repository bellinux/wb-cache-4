The costs of tendering {{may be influenced by}} the introduction of different working methods. Transaction cost economics appears to offer an analytical framework for studying the costs of tendering, but it is more to do with providing explanations at the institutional/industry level, not at the level of individual projects. Surveys and interviews were carried out with small samples in UK. The data show that that while tendering costs are not necessarily higher in collaborative working arrangements, there is no correlation between costs of tendering and the way the work is organized. Practitioners perceive that the benefits of working in collaborative procurement routes far outweigh the costs. Tendering practices can be improved to avoid waste, and the suggested improvements include restricting <b>selective</b> <b>tendering</b> lists to 23 bidders, letting bidders know who they are competing with, reimbursing tendering costs for aborted projects and ensuring that timely and comprehensive information is provided to bidders...|$|E
40|$|The UK's NJCC Code of Procedure for Single Stage <b>Selective</b> <b>Tendering</b> (now withdrawn) and its successor, the CIB's Code of Practice for the Selection of Main Contractors are {{criticized in}} the light of {{decisions}} of the common law courts with regard to regulation of the tendering process. It is argued that a new 'Tendering Code' should be produced in the style and format of a contract document which reflects not only the statutory regulation imposed on public bodies, but common law decisions of the courts. The nature of this tendering contract is explained as a means of regulating the tendering process. Issues discussed are: dealing with errors and irregularities found in tenders; dealing with non-compliant tenders; dealing with tender withdrawal prior to its acceptance or rejection; making provisions as to time for submission of tenders and dealing with late tenders; making provision for submission of tender by fax or other electronic means; making provision for evaluation of tenders received; and imposing or negotiating reductions in price with tenderers prior to acceptance. The paper concludes that the common law obligations placed on the owner to treat all tenderers equally and fairly and to apply the tender conditions when evaluating tenders and awarding contracts seems to be good common sense and of commercial advantage, not only to the immediate parties concerned but also to the wider community.

40|$|Several Literatures in {{construction}} management support {{the view that}} procurements have impacts on project performance. Aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the effects of procurement related factors of procurement selection criteria, tendering methods and variation orders on project performance. Purpose of the study is to evaluate the effects of procurement related factors on project performance. Snowballing sampling technique was used in selecting forty (40) construction organizations in Lagos metropolitan city that participated in the study and thirty-one (31) responses were secured from Architects, Builders, Engineers and Quantity Surveyors. Results of the study indicate that procurement selection criteria of cost, time, quality, project characteristics and external environmental factors have effects on project performance. Competitive, open and <b>selective</b> <b>tendering</b> methods have high impacts on project performance. No significant difference was found between the impacts of tendering methods on project performance. Variation orders impact project performance with time, cost overruns and disputes and it have effects on project performance. Conclusions are that procurement selection criteria, tendering methods and variation orders have impacts on project performance. Cost, time, quality related factors, tendering methods and variation orders strongly affect project performance. Recommendations to clients, stakeholders, practitioners and consultants are on the onset to consider tendering methods, use selective, open and competitive tendering approaches and discourage excessive variation orders during construction. Policy makers in government, clients, and private developers into housing projects should give adequate attention for selecting appropriate procurement and tendering methods for better management of future projects in Nigeria and other developing countries...|$|E

40|$|This paper aims to {{identify}} the main contractors&# 8217; current practice in subcontractor selection and their perception towards the long-term alliance relationship with their subcontractors. Fifteen {{interviews were conducted with}} executives of eight main contracting firms in Australia. The research found that the subcontractors were chosen mainly through <b>selective</b> or open <b>tendering</b> using the criteria of &# 8220;past performance, technical capability, reputation, financial stability, experience on similar work and lowest price&# 8221;. With regard to long-term relationship, the research found the main motivation is &# 8220;to achieve organisational competitive advantages&# 8221;, and the key successful elements include &# 8220;trusting behaviour, honesty, open communication and top management commitment&# 8221;, while the proactive strategies to achieve the long-term relationship include &# 8220;organise regular meetings, provide incentive financial scheme, maintain constant contacts, provide project programming ownership and provide structured and detail documentation&# 8221;. It is concluded that, with the aim of enhancing organisational competitive advantage, while <b>selective</b> and open <b>tendering</b> are the main means for subcontractor selection, the main contractors understand the importance and key successful elements of long-term relationship with their subcontractors and they have adopted some strategies to develop and maintain the long-term relationships...|$|R
40|$|Between {{the years}} of 1964 - 1975, one million {{dwellings}} were constructed in Sweden to counteract the at the time prevailing shortage of homes, this large-scale political project was given the name The Million Programme. The dwellings were very modern and were held with a high standard when they were constructed but neglected maintenance has resulted in some issues. Many of the houses built were high-rise rental buildings, they are now half a century old and in need for extensive repairs and standard raising measures due to age and natural wear but also in some cases, neglected maintenance. The economic expenditures for the much needed renovations are big and it is generally the tenants who pay for it with vastly increased rents. The buildings are often structurally sound; the need for refurbishment is mainly due to the technical condition of the building, stricter authority requirements in terms of energy consumption and availability {{as well as the}} social conditions of the immediate area. A troubling circumstance for investments in terms of refurbishments is that the Swedish government expressly opposes any form of financial support for renovations. A large portion of the buildings constructed during The Million Programme are located in socio-economically weak areas were the tenants have a limited solvency, questioning the economic benefit of an investment that in terms of a renovation. This thesis is to enlighten the problematics of The Million Programme housings, its flaws and to analyse the different approaches that exist to renew the apartment buildings. Furthermore, successful examples will be analysed were worn and dilapidated high-rise apartment buildings in rough quarters in both the UK and France have been regenerated in to innovatory and modern buildings which have not only benefited the tenants that live in them, but the entire surrounding vicinity. The outcomes of this report determine that an extensive refurbishment is the most suitable alternative for dilapidated high-rise apartment buildings. It is also established that an exterior makeover should not be circumvented. An attractive appearance raises the status of an area and the area is viewed as more attractive for residence which also enables the property owner to raise rents and counteracts a possible degree of vacancy. Another important factor to take in to consideration is that it is imperative to attempt to accomplish an inventive and creative refurbishment by using open <b>tender</b> rather than <b>selective</b> <b>tender,</b> and by doing so encouraging companies to offer added value by making use of creative and inventive approaches that will cut costs and give more value for the money...|$|R
40|$|A Lei de Licitações foi promulgada em 1993 com o objetivo de normatizar as aquisições de bens e serviços a serem efetuadas pela Administração Pública. Contudo, recebeu críticas e sugestões de alterações em razão de ser extremamente burocrática, lenta e dispendiosa. Dentre as indicações uma resultou em criação de outra modalidade licitatória. A novidade recebeu a denominação de Pregão e possui como características principais a inversão das fases licitatórias, permitindo haver redução de prazo na execução dos certames; um único momento para formulação de recurso, sendo somente aceitável quando devidamente motivado; e, a possibilidade de apresentação de lances verbais consecutivos. Enquanto as primeiras características foram aceitas e demonstraram um aperfeiçoamento nos processos de aquisição da Administração, a última delas, que permite a redução nos preços, tem sido informada como proveitosa mas com base no comparativo de pesquisa {{anterior}} e dos valores posteriormente contratados. Por isso, pretendeu-se com o presente estudo analisar o valor atualizado das aquisições advindas do Pregão e compará-los com aqueles das contratações realizadas por intermédio das modalidades tradicionais da Concorrência, da Tomada de Preços e do Convite. Os dados foram coletados consultando-se os contratos regidos pelo Superior Tribunal de Justiça, no período de 1996 a 2005. Utilizou-se os softwares SAS/STAT e EXCEL para a análise da regressão e das médias pareadas e os resultados demonstraram não ser possível afirmar haver economia nos preços contratados por Pregão quando comparados às modalidades tradicionais. ________________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThe Procurements Law was promulgated in 1993 {{in order}} to rule the acquisitions {{of goods and services}} to be effected by the Public Administration. However, it was criticized an received suggestions about being extremely bureaucratic, slow and expensive. Amongst the indications one resulted in creation of another bidding modality. The newness was denominated Proclamation [public solicitation to the lowest bidder] and it holds the main characteristics the inversion of the bidding phases, allowing to have reduction of stated period in the execution of the disputes; a single moment (time) for formulation of resource, being only acceptable when duly motivated; and, the possibility of presentation of consecutive oral bidding. Whereas the first characteristics had been accepted and demonstrated an improvement in the processes of acquisition of the Administration, the last one of them, that one that allows the reduction in the prices, has been informed as beneficial but {{on the basis of the}} comparative degree of previous research and the values later contracted. Therefore, it was intended with the present study to analyze the brought up to date value of the happened acquisitions of the Proclamation and to compare them with those of the acts of contract carried through the traditional modalities of the Open Tendering, the Price Quotation and the <b>Selective</b> <b>Tendering.</b> The data had been collected consulting contracts ruled (conducted) by High Justice Court, in the period from 1996 to 2005. The Softwares SAS/STAT and Excel for the analysis of the regression and the paired average were used and the results had demonstrated to be impossible to assert that has econmy in the Proclamation when compared with the traditional modalities...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This research exposes to examination and understanding the law governing procurement of construction and engineering works and services. The thesis captures both development of common law and judicial determination of statutory law. It {{takes the form of}} published journal articles and conference papers which discuss legal issues relevant to construction procurement and conclude with recommendations for clients and construction project managers on how to better manage the procurement process. The work reveals, inter alia, the extent to which contract law regulates the tendering phase of construction procurement and places the client under an obligation to the tenderer characterised as 'fair dealing' or 'good faith'. Chapter 1 is of an introductory nature. Chapter 2 sets the crime of manslaughter arising out of construction site fatality as a procurement issue. The author notes the UK government's intention to introduce the new offences of reckless killing, killing by gross carelessness and corporate killing. Chapter 3 discusses cases where disaffected parties to the tendering process have made private law challenges of that process seeking compensation for the other party's alleged irregularities. The client is generally obliged in law to treat all tenderers equally and fairly and to refrain from evaluating tenders and awarding contracts other than in accordance with the rules set down in the tender conditions. Chapter 4 addresses the question: do traditional tendering processes encourage, or merely permit, contractor innovation? Several tender codes are reviewed to establish whether these codes provide for, or encourage, innovative proposals from competing bidders. Chapter 5 provides updating case material for the period 1999 - 2000 which helps to underpin the conclusions and recommendations set out in Chapter 12. Chapter 6 is a criticism of the NJCC's Code of Procedure for Single Stage <b>Selective</b> <b>Tendering</b> and the CIB's Code of Practice for the Selection of Main Contractors. Suggestions are made as to what a new tender code might include in the light of selected decisions of the common law courts. It is argued that a set of 'standard' tender rules should become the terms of a 'tender contract'. Those rules would properly reflect decisions of the courts and would be accepted by all parties to the process as a tender contract document. Chapter 7 discusses how the common law protects the integrity of construction procurement by imposed or assumed contractual obligations. Procurement of subcontract works is also considered. The author concludes that the tendering contract operates between main contractor and subcontractor as it does between owner/ developer and main contractor, and that the 'two contract' analysis provides the best basis for upholding integrity of the bidding process. Chapter 8 sets out advice for quantity surveyors and project managers derived from the decisions of the common law courts. The author argues that practice should be shaped to reflect the obligations assumed by parties in common law so as to avoid claims from aggrieved bidders. In Chapter 9 the focus shifts from private to public law. A Scottish court denied a remedy to the unsuccessful bidder {{on the grounds that the}} contract award process was unfair, unreasonable and in breach of natural justice. The author argues that a successful case might have been made out in private law and concludes with recommendations as to how the tender process might be better conducted. Chapter 10 deals with public procurement under the rules of the European Union (EU), noting a particularly important decision by the European Court of Justice that contracting authorities are obliged to treat all tenderers equally and fairly, a duty that parallels that found in common law and discussed in Chapters 2 through 8. Chapter 10 concludes with an article on Rv Portsmouth City Council (1996), reviewing both decisions at first instance and in the English Court of Appeal. Chapter 11 considers the risks of developers and contractors by examining the effectiveness of 'controls' imposed by common law when the usual statutory controls are temporarily withdrawn. It can be seen that the common law has not evolved to protect the interests of neighbours and local residents from the perils and hazards of property development which result in environmental degradation. This chapter concludes with recommendations as to how developer and constructors might minimise their impact on adjacent property owners. Chapter 12 presents a summary of the conclusions drawn from the completed research project and the author's recommendations for further research within the procurement topic...|$|E
40|$|In the United Kingdom (UK), most clients adopt a <b>selective</b> {{approach}} to <b>tendering</b> {{that involves the}} prequalification of bidders through an assessment of their likelihood of producing good quality work, on time and within budget. Despite its strategic significance, {{there is a lack}} of a universally agreed standard upon which prequalification should be carried out. Clients assess contractors' capabilities on a subjective and informal basis. In this paper, the processes involved in contractor prequalification and the assessment methods used at different stages of prequalification are examined through a survey of clients and consultants in the UK with a view to identifying a possible rational and practical computer-based approach. The results suggest that this may be achieved through the development of a hybrid rule-based / multiattribute model. The decision rules and structure of the multiattribute model are presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} new bidders – bidders from whom there is no {{previous}} registered participation – is an important variable in most bid tender forecasting models, since the unknown competitive profile of the former strongly limits the predictive accuracy of the latter. Analogously, when a bidder considers entering a bid or when an auctioneer is handling a procurement auction, assessing the likely proportion of experienced bidders is considered an important aspect, as some strategic decisions or even the awarding criteria might differ. However, estimating the number of bidders in a future auction that have not submitted a single bid yet is difficult, {{since there is no}} data at all linking their potential participation, an essential requirement for the implementation of any forecasting or estimation method. A practical approach is derived for determining the expected proportion of new bidders to frequent bidders {{as a function of the}} population of potential bidders. A multinomial model useful for <b>selective</b> and open <b>tendering</b> is proposed and its performance is validated with a dataset of actual construction auctions. Final remarks concern the valuable information provided by the model to an enduring unsolved bidding problem and the prospects for new research continuations...|$|R
