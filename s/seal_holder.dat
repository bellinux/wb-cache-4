40|$|If we want {{to share}} data, the {{long-term}} storage of those data in a trustworthy digital archive is an essential condition. Trust {{is the basis of}} storing and sharing data. That trust must be present in the various stakeholders involved. Certification of digital archives can make an important contribution to the confidence of these stakeholders in the digital archives. Ten years ago DANS was assigned the task of developing a Seal of Approval for digital data to ensure that archived data can still be found, understood and used in the future. In 2009 this Data Seal of Approval (DSA) was transferred to an international body, the DSA Board, which has managed and further developed the guidelines and the peer review process ever since. The objectives of the DSA are to safeguard data, ensure high quality and guide reliable management of data for the future without requiring implementation of new standards, regulations or heavy investments. The DSA contains 16 guidelines for applying and verifying quality aspects concerning the creation, storage, use and reuse of digital data. Based on feedback from data archives that applied for a DSA and different case studies we have gained some insight into the benefits of DSA. Still, the impact of having the Seal is not easy to measure. <b>Seal</b> <b>holders</b> usually refer to qualitative benefits in the form of increased awareness of the value of their repositories to their communities, funders and publishers. Ten years down the line we can safely state that the Data Seal of Approval has proven its added value. If we try to look five years into the future, what can we expect? There are different developments: a growing interest in DSA among European research infrastructures, the collaboration between DSA and the ISCU World Data System under the umbrella of the RDA (Research Data Alliance) and the European Commission is showing a growing interest in certification services. The success of DSA also provides the challenge to further professionalize the DSA organization in the coming years, this to enable its community to continue to grow. All in all there are promising developments for a bright future for the Data Seal of Approval. </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{rotation}} device (RD) {{specifically designed}} to achieve sterile endothelial cell (EC) seeding of vascular grafts has been developed. The basic characteristics of the RD include: small dimensions, fully autoclavable components, and perfectly <b>sealed</b> graft <b>holders.</b> These features {{make it possible to}} maintain sterility during all the steps of EC seeding. This was documented by negativity of all bacteriological assays performed. Moreover, the RD can simultaneously support three vascular grafts with different lengths (20, 40, and 60 cm) and diameters (4 - 8 mm). EC seeding is performed in the climatized chamber (37 °C; 5 % C 02) with constant rotation (0. 1 - 3 rpm). The rotation cycle can be completed automatically. The practical efficacy of the RD was investigated by seeding 2 x 105 /cm 2 of human microvascular EC on 20 cm length, 4 mm internal diameter (ID) fibronectin- coated polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafts for 24 and 48 hours respectively. Further, the effect of a highly viscous plasma expander, i. e., haemagel, on cell retention was also evaluated. Results were not as favorable as expected. However, it should be emphasized that after 48 hours of eel! incubation by using the RD, 42 % of the initially seeded EC were still present and approximately 15 % were fully spread over the graft surface. Moreover, the 10 minute perfusion with haemagel did not decrease the number of adherent microvascular EC...|$|R
50|$|Although {{there were}} several parathalassitai in the Byzantine provinces, the most {{important}} holder of the office was the parathalassitēs of Constantinople, the imperial capital. The origins of the office are obscure: an anonymous chronicle attributes its creation to Emperor Justinian I (r. 527-565). He may {{be regarded as the}} rough equivalent of the comes riparum ("count of the river") and comes portus ("count of the port") of Old Rome. Like him, he was a subordinate official of the urban prefect, also known as the Eparch of Constantinople; in Philotheos's Klētorologion of 899, he is indeed shown as being of relatively lowly rank. The office, however, evidently rose in importance later, during the 11th and 12th centuries, as attested by the senior dignities (up to prōtoproedros and kouropalatēs) in surviving <b>seals</b> of <b>holders</b> of the office. It is possible, as surmised by Helene Ahrweiler, that {{at about the same time}} the office was removed from the urban prefect's purview and made an independent government department, putting the parathalassitēs on the same footing as the urban prefect and the logothetēs tou genikou. In the 12th century, multiple holders of the office are attested at the same time. It is not known when the office was abolished, but it does not appear in sources from the 13th century onwards.|$|R
40|$|Poor {{thermal shock}} and {{resistance}} to crack propagation have had a negative influence on the acceptance of ceramics for components in air breathing engine applications. In comparison with their metallic counterparts, they are less predictable and there is limited historical in-use data available. They have therefore been considered primarily for non-load bearing applications such as flaps and <b>seals,</b> flame <b>holders</b> and covers. A fibrous monolith, ceramic hybrid between a Si 3 N 4 core with a weak BN interface has been evaluated for non-load bearing applications in air breathing engines where {{a high degree of}} thermal shock resistance is required. The fibrous monolith architecture confines damage to local regions and although the overall strength is typically reduced, the macroscopic damage tolerance and thermal shock resistance is improved over monolithic S 3 N 4 of similar compositions. Two different architectural scales with a cell size of 150 µm and 30 µm were investigated. Both architectures showed a similar response with no loss in strength when quenched from below 800 °C and no loss in modulus when quenched from 1000 °C into water. Cyclic thermal shock from 600 °C showed no change in modulus but at 1000 °C a gradual drop in the modulus was observed. Microstructural assessment of the Si 3 N 4 core and BN phases showed microcracking of the BN phase following thermal shock but no discernable changes in the Si 3 N 4 phase. The thermal shock resistance of the FM Si 3 N 4 / BN structure is improved over monolithic Si 3 N 4 due to the ability of the weak BN interface to preferentially microcrack and accommodate strain. Improved thermal shock resistance has been demonstrated in water quench tests as well as in a gas burner rig test where heating rates and temperatures more representative of those observed in engine applications have been investigated.

40|$|Gas {{has proved}} to be a {{successful}} extractable hydrocarbon resource from shale in the United States. In Europe results have so far been disappointing, but with increasing global energy demand a lot of interest remains in the potential of recoverable shale gas reservoirs. However, the way how the economic potential of shale is mapped is insufficient, because there are no industrywide measurement techniques available for measuring the flow properties of these (ultra) low permeable rocks. A proper assessment of the petrophysical properties of the cores from potential areas is therefore very difficult and the results are highly variable. This study assesses the problems found after evaluating a round robin of experiments on selected samples. The multi-lab experiment was performed on crushed shale to compare the results between different laboratories. The permeability results from the various renowned laboratories were found to differ by multiple orders of magnitude on permeability results. For this study, a selection of core plugs and crushed material from various shale formations was analyzed using a wide spectrum of experiments and history match simulation models. The experiments were performed on the analyzed shales and consist of xenon expansion under a CT scan, as well as helium and methane expansion on linear, radial and crushed core plugs in confined and unconfined <b>sealed</b> core <b>holders</b> for different gas pressures. The measured data was history matched with multiple models including a single and multiple porosity-permeability model, with and without a high-permeability streak (e. g. fracture or silt layer) and the Klinkenberg effect. The combination of all these experiments and simulations resulted in a large dataset. After significant quality control, conclusions could be drawn from this data set, resulting in clearer insights into how porosity and permeability from shale samples can better be computed compared to the current technique that uses simulation results from a crushed GRI experiment. Xenon flow in shales under a CT scan provided some insights into the permeabilities of the studied sample, but the accuracy is low. Propagation of the expanded gas over time could be monitored when the measured data was extracted from these images. If more information about the flow behavior of the expanded gas could be derived from the CT images of xenon invasion, this would improve the understanding and makes the simulation model more realistic. The round robin test results for porosity were found to be similar between the laboratories. These experiments were conducted with the noble gas helium. Even though methane has a larger molecule size than helium, the computed porosity from methane expansion is larger due to adsorption on organic matter. Langmuir curve experiment results showed adsorption curves whose maxima positively with the TOC (total organic carbon) of the samples. A more reliable approach than the round robin test results for permeability is proposed by combining the results of the experiments, such as perform a full core experiment on a radial sample drilled parallel to its lamination in an unconfined set-up, then measure a radial linear sample drilled perpendicular to its lamination in a confined set-up and finally perform a combination of these techniques. The first two of these experiments can be inverted with a single porosity-permeability model and the last one with a multiple porosity-permeability model. The first two results can thus verify the high and low case of the multiple porosity-permeability model, resulting in a more reliable result than obtaining permeability from crushed shale history matches.

40|$|The {{nuclear testing}} {{facilities}} {{all around the}} world which perform irradiation experiment sometime use sodium inside the experiment itself to enhance thermal heat transfer. Nowadays, the development of sodium technologies for the Sodium Fast Reactor (SFR) requires new easiest methodologies to be able to characterise all aspects related to the use of Sodium. Usually, the level of Sodium inside a <b>sealed</b> metallic sample <b>holder</b> is checked with X-ray but sometime, especially if the sodium to detect is not so much, there could be some troubles finding its exact level. The problems, checking the level of the sodium with X-ray, are {{due to the fact that}} the opacity of thin layer of Sodium can be not easily recognised. Moreover, a check on the volume of sodium inserted can not always be sufficient to establish the exact level of the sodium inserted due to the geometrical complexity of the devices contained in the metallic sample holder and generally it is used as double check when the exact level of the sodium is recognised with the use of X-ray. The needed to establish the exact level of sodium inserted in a metallic sample holder came from an experiment which has been recently performed at the High Flux Reactor (HFR) in Petten. The name of the experiment was HELIOS and it was dealing with the irradiation of U-free fuels containing americium. The X-ray performed on the sample holder containing HELIOS shows immediately the difficulty to see, among the other things contained in the sample holder, the exact level of the sodium inserted. Hence, it started an investigation to find out other easy and cheap methods that, together with X-Ray, can help the detection of the level of sodium. In fact the availability of other easy and cheap methods based on different physical phenomena, although can be affected by the same problems encountered with the X-Ray, can be useful to confirm the exact level of the sodium inside a metallic sample holder. A round robin test has been prepared with a dummy metallic sample holder filled with an unknown amount of Sodium. The paper will contains the background of the methodology that could be employed as well as the description of the experiments performed in order to establish the level of the sodium inside a dummy sealed stainless steel sample holder filled with an unknown amount of Sodium. An original, easy and cheap methodology will be described. It should be mentioned that a deep investigation using ultrasonic device has not been performed because considered obviously useful and the natural alternative to the X-Ray methods. Other methodologies have been investigated because considered much easier and less expensive. JRC. DDG. F. 4 -Safety of future nuclear reactor...|$|R
