6000|$|In {{writing to}} him upon this speech, Mr. Stephen, his former ally at the colonial office, {{addressed}} an admonition, which is worth, recalling both {{for its own}} sake and because it hits by anticipation what was {{to be one of the}} most admirable traits in the mighty parliamentarian to whom it was written. 'It seems to me,' <b>says</b> <b>Stephen,</b> 'that this part of your speech establishes nothing more than the fact that your opponents are capricious in the distribution of their sympathy, which is, after all, a reproach and nothing more. Now, reproach is not only not your strength, but it is the very thing in the disuse of which your strength consists; and indulging as I do the hope that you will one day occupy one of the foremost stations in the House of Commons, if not the first of all, I cannot help wishing that you may also be the founder of a more magnanimous system of parliamentary tactics than has ever yet been established, in which recrimination will be condemned as unbefitting wise men and good Christians.' In an assembly for candid deliberation modified by party spirit, this is, I fear, almost as much a counsel of perfection as it would have been in a school of Roman gladiators, but at any rate it points the better way. The speech itself has a close, direct, sinewy quality, a complete freedom from anything vague or involved; and shows for the first time a perfect mastery of the art of handling detail upon detail without an instant of tediousness, and holding the attention of listeners sustained and unbroken. It was a remonstrance against false allegations of the misbehaviour of the planters since the emancipating act, but there is not a trace of backsliding upon the great issue. 'We joined in passing the measure; we declared a belief that slavery was an evil and demoralising state, and a desire to be relieved from it; we accepted a price in composition for the loss which was expected to accrue.' ...|$|E

5000|$|The poem {{is settled}} in the rose, {{to the point that}} the poem’s tone is one of sweet, {{suffering}} melancholy, a tone that is reaching for the sublime. In the 1890s, <b>says</b> <b>Stephen</b> Coote, Yeats was concerned for the “spiritual regeneration of his people”: he felt that a spiritual posture of awe, a posture taken before those things that were excellent, beautiful, and full of grandeur, was necessary to achieve that regeneration. The Oxford Dictionary notes that the etymology of “sublime” renders a Latin root, sublimus, meaning “below the threshold.” The sublime, then, is that which is so beautiful it borders on the spiritual or the divine: Yeats poses the rose as a starting point for spiritual regeneration, and surrounds this symbol with the beautiful lyricism, euphony, rhyme and meter which characterizes his early poetry.|$|E

5000|$|For {{his early}} films, {{although}} they were consistently well photographed, Kurosawa generally used standard lenses and deep-focus photography. Beginning with Seven Samurai (1954), however, Kurosawa's cinematic technique changed drastically with his extensive use of long lens and multiple cameras. The director claimed that he used these lenses and several cameras rolling at once to help the actors—allowing them to be photographed at {{some distance from the}} lens, and without any knowledge of which particular camera's image would be utilized in the final cut—making their performances much more natural.

40|$|Australia’s refugee {{policies}} are expensive {{in the short}} term and damage our economic prospects in the long term, <b>says</b> <b>Stephen</b> Bartos THE debate about refugees who try to come to Australia by boat is usually couched in terms of big concepts like morals, ethics, rights and sovereignty. For a few minutes let us instead take a cold, hard economic look at the issue. We know that one of the biggest economic problems we face in future is aging of the population. The government’s own Intergenerational Report warns of the dangers of the present generation of taxpayers imposing a heavy cost burden on the next. It argues that policies need to be “adjusted” by $ 87 billion by 2041. That is based though on overseas migration staying constant at around current levels. In its appendix an increased migration scenario results in “a decline in the aged to working-age ratio over the next four decades and a 10 per cent increase in GDP by 2041 - 42 ”. Taking out the jargon, increased migration to Australia will help ease the economic costs of aging. But by 2040 we will be in competition with many other countries for people to come here. Australia is still a relatively young country, and others face the aging problem sooner than us. They too will seek to encourage more migration. Around the world we see governments with aging populations already starting to think this way. What {{does that have to do}} with refugees? Well, one obvious factor that influences a country’s competitiveness in attracting migrants is whether that country is perceived as wanting them. What signals do our current approach to interception and mandatory detention send? Precisely the opposite. “We will decide who comes to this country and in what circumstances” made for an effective political slogan at the last election, but how does it sound from the perspective of people from other countries? Put it in personal terms - would you want to go to stay at a hotel or holiday resort which had that as its marketing slogan? Sure, right at the moment there are enough people who want to come to Australia that we don’t need to worry too much about how attractive we make the place sound. That won’t be so in 2040. But by then it will be too late to try to repair the damage to our reputation - and we will lose out in the competition for migrants. Policies that exploit the fears and insecurities of current Australians thus are diminishing the hopes and prospects of our children. A second economic issue is our labour market, and the people qualities needed to make our economy prosper. Companies aiming to succeed in a fast moving world no longer look for employees with narrowly based skills or training - much more important is their capacity to develop new skills. An ideal employee, or for that matter the new small business owner, is resilient, innovative, has initiative, resourcefulness and a positive attitude. That sounds a lot to me like a person prepared to leave their home country to escape oppression and make their way across the world in search of something better. This is not just theory. Thousands of Vietnamese boat people who arrived in Australia under the Fraser government have been highly successful in all walks of life. Our economy and society has been the winner. Finally, there is a simple economic fact that mandatory detention is a huge impost on the budget. Detention camps are more expensive than if we were to put boat people up in a five star hotel - and that’s just the costs in Australia. The so-called Pacific solution is much more expensive. This is some of the economic story. For the record, I happen to think the refugee issue is a moral one. Refugees deserve respect and compassion regardless of how they come here, and current government policy is inhumane and diminishes our standing as a decent society. However, I don’t need to make these points to listeners who agree with me on moral grounds, and likewise I doubt I will ever convince those who disagree on moral grounds. What I hope is that readers who do not hold strong views either way on the ethical issues will at least consider the economic arguments. Current refugee {{policies are}} expensive {{in the short term}} and damage our economic prospects in the long term. As a nation, can we really afford to maintain them?

40|$|Australians want {{better health}} services, not {{political}} whinging and buck-passing, <b>says</b> <b>Stephen</b> Duckett THE HEALTH Summit in Canberra {{last week was}} part of an attempt to get governments, both state and federal, to address problems in the Australian health-care system. The major funding agreement for health services, the Australian Health Care Agreement, is overdue for renewal, the previous agreement having expired on 30 June. The renegotiation process started well from the viewpoint of practitioners in the health sector, with the federal health minister, Kay Patterson, agreeing to establish a number of working parties involving clinicians, consumers, and state and federal bureaucrats to address perceived contemporary issues. These working parties generated a lot of enthusiasm, energy, and ideas, although many of the ideas were probably unfeasible in the short term and more suited for longer-term consideration. Unfortunately, they got no consideration at all and the Commonwealth produced a new Health Care Agreement that took no account of the aspirations of practitioners and consumers for a relook at how we organise health care in Australia. It would seem that Senator Patterson’s initiative in supporting the working parties was not welcomed by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet or the prime minister. The apron strings were accordingly tightened and the so-called negotiations degenerated into farce, Senator Patterson playing hide and seek with health ministers refusing (or not being allowed) to attend scheduled health ministers’ meetings to discuss the proposed agreement. The Commonwealth has produced an agreement that it has insisted the states sign or lose funding. Politically, the situation in the health industry is such that states cannot afford to lose the funding that the Commonwealth has on the table. States are expected to sign the agreement by the Commonwealth-imposed deadline of the end of August, {{despite the fact that the}} new agreement is significantly less generous than the one it replaces, with proposed funding about $ 1 billion less than included in the Commonwealth’s Forward Estimates. States will be forced to respond by a combination of budget cuts, increased taxes or cost shifting. Relationships between the Commonwealth and the states are now worse than they have been in the past 20 years. Senator Patterson will have to battle to regain any credibility with state health ministers, and her department is also seen as being entirely hamstrung by the central agencies. Her predecessor, Michael Wooldridge, wrote his MBA thesis on the idiosyncratic health-policy process under the Fraser government, when policy was also dominated by the central agencies. He learned the lessons of this and used to say he woke up every morning planning how he would maintain control of health policy. Senator Patterson appears to have given up that fight. It was in this environment that last week’s health summit was called. A taskforce of clinicians, frustrated by perceived underfunding of public hospitals, quickly broadened to include a range of other organisations calling for reform. The summit itself was probably not representative of the Australian population, but a large number of health professional organisations endorsed it and sent delegates. There was also a substantial consumer contingent and significant representation from Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. The government’s response to the summit was to continue the hide-and-seek process, deriding it as a stunt, denigrating the participants, and attempting to avoid engagement with the issues. This has been the history of health-policy discussion in Australia for too long and one of the summit’s suggestions was that there should be an attempt to cut this Gordian knot with a health-reform council or a similar vehicle to allow engagement of clinicians, consumers and bureaucrats in a process of reform. The government’s response has been swift and expensive. Full-page ads have appeared in most of Australia’s newspapers presenting the government’s ostrich position. The dynamics of change in the health system are clear. Health insurance is again under threat as a key component of the health system, as young people find health insurance a product that is not delivering and hence, despite life-time cover and the rebate, give it up. The health system does not have a sufficient emphasis on primary care and prevention and there are problems in elderly people getting access to appropriate residential care and community services. These problems will not go away by a head-in-the-sand attitude. The Commonwealth Government must come back to the table to discuss policy reform. It must do so in a way that acknowledges that the agreement it has slapped on the table is not going to be the answer for the next five years. Some discussion at this week’s meeting of the Council of Australian Governments should be the start of that process. The irony of all this is that the health system is funded by Australian taxpayers. The same people pay income tax to the Commonwealth and stamp duties to the state. The undignified bickering between Commonwealth and state about who should pay is not an edifying spectacle. What Australians want are better health services and improved health. They don’t want politicians whinging and buck-passing about the future. They want action. The detailed proposals from the summit will not necessarily provide the panacea but what the summit was trying to do was to get politicians to realise that there is a groundswell of support for improvement to the health system. It will be a pity if this agenda gets lost in the swamp that appears to be the current health-policy process. Stephen Duckett is professor of health policy at La Trobe University in Melbourne.
