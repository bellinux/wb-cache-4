40|$|International audienceKarst {{aquifers}} {{are known}} for being particularly heterogeneous with highly transmissive conduits embedded in low permeability volumes of rock matrix. Artificial tracer experiments {{have been carried out}} in a complex karst aquifer of the folded Jura Mountains in Switzerland with the aim of deciphering the conduit organisation. It is shown that tracer experiments with multiple injection points under different flow conditions can lead to useful information on the conduits' structure. This information has been combined with data from structural geology, <b>spring</b> <b>hydrology,</b> and speleological observations. A conceptual model of the conduit network shows that a detailed inference of the conduit organisation can be reached: geology controls conduit location and orientation; <b>spring</b> <b>hydrology,</b> including temporary <b>springs,</b> constrains conduit elevations and relative hydraulic heads in the aquifer subsystems; and tracer tests identify major flow paths and outlets of the system and dilution caused by non-traced tributaries, as well as the presence of secondary flow routes. This understanding of the Aubonne aquifer structure has important implications for the future management of the groundwater resource. Similar approaches coupling geological information, <b>spring</b> <b>hydrology,</b> and multi-tracer tests under various flow conditions may help to characterise the structure of the conduit network in karst aquifers...|$|R

30|$|Conversions of {{agricultural}} land to non-agricultural land and forest land to non-forest land {{are some of}} the important factors influencing the <b>spring</b> <b>hydrology</b> in the catchment areas. The total forest area in 1980 – 1981 was 4.9 lakh hectares, which reduced to 4.2 lakhs hectares in 2000 – 2001, indicating a decline in the forest area of about 14 %. A comparison of the land use data of 1994 – 1995 with 2000 – 2001 indicate that the barren and non-agricultural land decreased to about 6 % and land for non-agricultural uses increased to about 8 % in 2000 – 2001 (Sah and Mazari 2007). This clearly demonstrates the impact of increased urbanisation in the Kullu valley.

40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} the detection, in a {{sediment}} core drilled in Lake Le Bourget (French Alps), of a fossil molecule (miliacin) that was synthesized by broomcorn millet cultivated in the watershed, and then exported to the sediment. The variation in abundance of this molecule allows us reconstructing the history of millet cultivation around Lake Le Bourget. Our results support the introduction of millet around - 1700 BC in the region. After an intensive cultivation during the Late Bronze Age, the failure of millet cropping during the Hallstatt period coincides with a phase of climatic deterioration. Millet cultivation recovers during the Roman and Mediaeval periods before falling most {{probably due to the}} introduction of more productive cereals.

40|$|Atmospheric dust {{loadings}} have {{a significant}} influence on global climate by affecting air temperatures through the absorption and scattering of solar radiation. Many dryland basins are significant sources of aeolian dust, but our knowledge of how dust emissions from these systems are affected by ephemeral wetting events is either limited or poor. This research uses synergistic data sets (Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)) {{in order to identify}} possible hydrological controls on aeolian dust emissions from the Etosha Basin, Namibia. Data suggest that individual inundation events (detected by AVHRR) within this basin have a marked effect on immediate and subsequent dust emissions (detected by TOMS).

40|$|This paper reviews how {{remotely}} sensed {{data have}} been used to understand the impact of urbanization on global environmental change. We describe how these studies can support the policy and science communities’ increasing need for detailed and up-to-date information on the multiple dimensions of cities, including their social, biological, physical, and infrastructural characteristics. Because the interactions between urban and surrounding areas are complex, a synoptic and spatial view offered from remote sensing is integral to measuring, modeling, and understanding these relationships. Here we focus on three themes in urban remote sensing science: mapping, indices, and modeling. For mapping we describe the data sources, methods, and limitations of mapping urban boundaries, land use and land cover, population, temperature, and air quality. Second, we described how spectral information is manipulated to create comparative biophysical, social, and spatial indices of the urban environment. Finally, we focus how the mapped information and indices are used as inputs or parameters in models that measure changes in climate, <b>hydrology,</b> <b>land</b> use, and economics...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Over {{the past}} few decades, it has become evident that the natural {{environment}} is an entity that humans need to better understand. Environmental education is defined here as {{the teaching and learning}} of, and about, nature and human interaction with nature. Traditionally, the environment has been researched and taught about in a piecemeal fashion – Studies and instruction in the sciences (<b>hydrology,</b> <b>land</b> cover, soil, atmosphere, etc.) were completely separate from social issues related to the environment. However, a new approach to conducting research has permeated environmental studies whereby a systems approach (or a more-holistic view) is utilized that combines ideas and approaches from the sciences and humanities. Some schools are beginning to implement this approach by organizing environmental curricula in a systems or holistic manner. This paper provides an application of C. P. Snow’s ideas in thinking about how to develop curriculum and teaching strategies that transcend the piecemeal approach (and the corresponding cultures associated with each discipline) and provide a deeper understanding for students of not only the elements of the environment, but also {{the ways in which they}} interact and their relationship to social issues...|$|R

40|$|A {{key issue}} in {{landslide}} susceptibility mapping concerns {{the relevance of}} the spatial data combination used in the prediction. Various combinations of high-resolution predictor variables and possibilities of selecting them from a larger dataset are analysed. The scarp reactivation of several landslides in a hilly region of W Belgium is investigated at the pixel scale. The susceptibility modelling uses the reactivated scarp segments as the dependent variable and 13 factors at a 2. m-resolution related to topography, <b>hydrology,</b> <b>land</b> use and lithology as potential independent variables. The modelling uses a likelihood ratio approach based on the comparison, for each independent variable, between two empirical distribution functions (EDFs), respectively for the reactivated and non-reactivated areas. It uses these EDFs as favourability values to build membership values and combine them with a fuzzy Gamma operator. Five different data combinations are tested and compared by analysing the prediction-rate curves obtained by cross-validation. The geomorphological value of the resulting susceptibility maps is also discussed. This research shows relevant results for predicting the susceptibility to scarp reactivation.

30|$|Availability {{of fresh}} water {{resources}} is quintessential for sustainable socioeconomic development throughout the world. Both surface water and groundwater contribute to domestic, industrial and agriculture needs in many countries. Millions of people lack access to safe drinking water and its scarcity is more acute in the arid and semi-arid regions (Dhar et al. 2014; Kumar et al. 2005; Keesari et al. 2002; Lee and Han 2013). There are also reports on scarcity of potable water in mountainous regions of Himalayas (Singh and Kumar 1997; Shivanna et al. 2008). For fresh water supplies, groundwater {{in the form of}} springs has been the traditional and conventional source for the rural communities as well as for peri-urban and urban areas of Himalayan region of Indian subcontinent (Singh et al. 2014). In recent times, it is observed that drying up of springs is more frequent in Himalayan region and even the perennial springs show an alarming decrease in the discharges (Valdiya and Bhartiya 1991; Ravindranath et al. 2011; Tambe et al. 2011; Shivanna et al. 2008). Studies on springs have received limited attention in Himalaya though it falls under Global Biodiversity Hotspot (Tambe et al. 2011). With increased human intervention, drying of springs is becoming widespread across the Himalaya (Shivanna et al. 2008; Chinnasamy and Prathapar 2016) and especially in regions known for tourism (Boselli et al. 2005). Changes in land use pattern by both anthropogenic and natural factors during last two decades (1991 – 2011) have significantly impacted <b>spring</b> <b>hydrology</b> leading to a 35 % decline in the river and stream flows in mountainous regions (Pant and Rawat 2015). In addition to quantity issues, the spring water quality was also reported to be declining due to anthropogenic factors and needs to be treated before using for domestic purposes (Nair et al. 2015). The infiltration of wastewater from cesspools and septic tanks into groundwater is considered as the major source of pollution (An and Breindenbach 2005; Al-Khashman 2007). Fertilizer application for agriculture and microbial contamination were also found to be impacting water quality of springs severely (Rowden et al. 2001). In addition to these factors, irrational land transformation also has disrupted the ecological balance of the Himalayan watersheds through reduced groundwater recharge, increased run-off and soil erosion (Tiwari 2000), which in turn adversely impacted the <b>spring</b> water <b>hydrology.</b>|$|R
