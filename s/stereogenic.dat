5|$|As already described, chiral liquid-crystal {{molecules}} usually {{give rise}} to chiral mesophases. This means that the molecule must possess some form of asymmetry, usually a <b>stereogenic</b> center. An additional requirement is that the system not be racemic: a mixture of right- and left-handed molecules will cancel the chiral effect. Due to the cooperative nature of liquid crystal ordering, however, {{a small amount of}} chiral dopant in an otherwise achiral mesophase is often enough to select out one domain handedness, making the system overall chiral.|$|E

25|$|Branched alkanes can be chiral. For example, 3-methylhexane and its higher homologues are chiral due {{to their}} <b>stereogenic</b> center at carbon atom number 3.

25|$|Amygdalin is {{contained}} in stone fruit kernels, such as apricot (8%), peach (6%), bitter almond (5%), and plum (2.5%); amygdalin {{is also found in}} the seeds of the apple. The stones are taken out of the fruit and cracked to obtain the kernels, which are dried in the sun or in ovens. The kernels are boiled in ethanol; on evaporation of the solution and the addition of diethyl ether, amygdalin is precipitated as white minute crystals. Natural amygdalin has the (R)-configuration at the chiral phenyl center. Under mild basic conditions, this <b>stereogenic</b> center isomerizes; the (S)-epimer is called neoamygdalin. Although the synthesized version of amygdalin is the (R)-epimer, the <b>stereogenic</b> center attached to the nitrile and phenyl groups easily epimerizes if the manufacturer does not store the compound correctly.|$|E
25|$|The aldol {{reaction}} is particularly useful because two new <b>stereogenic</b> centers are generated in one reaction.

The syn/anti convention is commonly used to denote the relative stereochemistry at the α- and β-carbon.|$|E
25|$|Improvements to {{synthetic}} methods led to {{a revision}} of the stereochemistry of CYN in 2001. A synthetic process controlling {{each of the six}} <b>stereogenic</b> centres of epiCYN established that the original assignments of both CYN and epiCYN were in fact a reversal of the correct structures. An alternative approach by White and Hansen supported these absolute configurations (Figure 5). At the time of this correct assignment, it was suggested that the enol form was not dominant.|$|E
25|$|One {{solution}} to the problem of oxidation is to replace the hydrogens ortho to the carbon-carbon double bond by groups that can not be removed during the oxidation. Following the Woodward–Hoffmann rules, the photochemical 6π cyclization takes place in a conrotatory fashion, leading to products with an anti configuration of the methyl substitutents. As both methyl groups are attached to a <b>stereogenic</b> center, two enantiomers (R,R and S,S) are formed, normally as a racemic mixture. This approach also has the advantage that the thermal (disrotatory) ring closure can not take place because of steric hindrance between the substitution groups.|$|E
25|$|During the {{conversion}} from straight-chain {{form to the}} cyclic form, the carbon atom containing the carbonyl oxygen, called the anomeric carbon, becomes a <b>stereogenic</b> center with two possible configurations: The oxygen atom may take a position either above or below {{the plane of the}} ring. The resulting possible pair of stereoisomers is called anomers. In the α anomer, the -OH substituent on the anomeric carbon rests on the opposite side (trans) of the ring from the CH2OH side branch. The alternative form, in which the CH2OH substituent and the anomeric hydroxyl are on the same side (cis) of the plane of the ring, is called the β anomer.|$|E
25|$|Alpha-carbon (α-carbon) {{is also a}} {{term that}} applies to {{proteins}} and amino acids. It is the backbone carbon before the carbonyl carbon. Therefore, reading along the backbone of a typical protein would give a sequence of –n– etc. (when reading in the N to C direction). The α-carbon is where the different substituents attach to each different amino acid. That is, the groups hanging off the chain at the α-carbon are what give amino acids their diversity. These groups give the α-carbon its <b>stereogenic</b> properties for every amino acid except for glycine. Therefore, the α-carbon is a stereocenter for every amino acid except glycine. Glycine also {{does not have a}} β-carbon, while every other amino acid does.|$|E

(+)-discodermolide has {{a linear}} polypropionate backbone, punctuated by Z-olefinic {{linkages}} at C(8,9) and C(13,14), a terminal Z-diene substituent at C(21–24), 13 <b>stereogenic</b> centers (including four secondary hydroxyls and seven methyl substituents), a carbamate, and a fully substituted D-lactone. The relative stereochemistry {{was determined by}} X-ray crystallography. The absolute stereochemistry of (+)-discodermolide was reported by Schreiber and his co-workers in 1993. Discodermolide adopts a U-shaped conformation, where the internal (Z)-alkenes act as conformational locks by minimizing allylic strain and syn-pentane interactions along the backbone. The D-lactone is held in a boat-like conformation.|$|E
2500|$|A {{variety of}} {{substitution}} patterns are possible with ferrocene including substition at {{one or both}} of the rings. The most common substitution patterns are 1-substituted (one substituent on one ring) and 1,1′-disubstituted (one substituent on each ring). Usually the rings rotate freely, which simplifies the isomerism. Disubstituted ferrocenes can exist as either 1,2-, 1,3- or 1,1′- isomers, none of which are interconvertible. Ferrocenes that are asymmetrically disubstituted on one ring are chiral– for example [...] is chiral but [...] is achiral. This planar chirality arises despite no single atom being a <b>stereogenic</b> centre. The substituted ferrocene shown at right (a 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine derivative) has been shown to be effective when used for the kinetic resolution of racemic secondary alcohols.Ph5) Group in Asymmetric Catalysis|journal= J.

2500|$|Each carbon atom {{bearing a}} {{hydroxyl}} group (-OH), {{with the exception}} of the first and last carbons, are asymmetric, making them stereo centers with two possible configurations each (R or S). Because of this asymmetry, a number of isomers may exist for any given monosaccharide formula. Using Le Bel-van't Hoff rule, the aldohexose D-glucose, for example, has the formula (C·H2O)6, of which four of its six carbons atoms are <b>stereogenic,</b> making D-glucose one of 24=16 possible stereoisomers. In the case of glyceraldehydes, an aldotriose, there is one pair of possible stereoisomers, which are enantiomers and epimers. 1, 3-dihydroxyacetone, the ketose corresponding to the aldose glyceraldehydes, is a symmetric molecule with no stereo centers. The assignment of D or L is made according to the orientation of the asymmetric carbon furthest from the carbonyl group: in a standard Fischer projection if the hydroxyl group is on the right the molecule is a D sugar, otherwise it is an L sugar. The [...] "D-" [...] and [...] "L-" [...] prefixes should not be confused with [...] "d-" [...] or [...] "l-", which indicate the direction that the sugar [...] rotates plane polarized light.

50|$|In general, chiral {{molecules}} have point chirality at {{a single}} <b>stereogenic</b> atom, which has four different substituents. The two enantiomers of such compounds {{are said to have}} different absolute configurations at this center. This center is thus <b>stereogenic</b> (i.e., a grouping within a molecular entity that may be considered a focus of stereoisomerism). The <b>stereogenic</b> atom is usually carbon, as in many biological molecules. However chirality can exist in any atom, including metals (as in many chiral coordination compounds), phosphorus, or sulfur. Chiral nitrogen is equally possible, although the effects of nitrogen inversion can make many of these compounds impossible to isolate.While the presence of a <b>stereogenic</b> atom describes the great majority of cases, many variations and exceptions exist. For instance it is not necessary for the chiral substance to have a <b>stereogenic</b> atom. Examples include 1-bromo-3-chloro-5-fluoroadamantane, methylethylphenyltetrahedrane, certain calixarenes and fullerenes, which have inherent chirality. The C2-symmetric species 1,1'-bi-2-naphthol (BINOL), 1,3-dichloro-allene have axial chirality. (E)-cyclooctene and many ferrocenes have planar chirality.|$|E
