40|$|The {{performance}} of an RF output matching network {{is dependent on}} integrity of the ground connection. If this connection is compromised in anyway, additional parasitic elements may occur that can degrade performance and yield unreliable results. Traditionally, designers measure Constant Wave (CW) power to determine that the RF chain is performing optimally, the device is properly matched and by implication grounded. It is shown that there are situations where modulation quality can be compromised due to poor grounding that is not apparent using CW power measurements alone. The consequence of this is reduced throughput, range and reliability. Measurements are presented on a Tyndall Mote using a CC 2420 RFIC todemonstrate how poor <b>solder</b> <b>contact</b> between the ground contacts and the ground layer of the PCB can lead tothe degradation of modulated performance.

In this technology, under bump metallization (UBM) {{is required for}} chemical solder deposition and mechanically reliable <b>solder</b> <b>contact</b> to Al pads. An evaporated Cr/phased CrCu/Cu structure UBM has been used with 95 Pb/ 5 Sn and also with 37 Pb/ 63 Sn solder for flip-chip interconnection. In this study, the intermediate CrCu layer is modified using various sputtering techniques, and the underlying Cr adhesion layer is compared with TiW. Six UBM systems were selected, and their interfacial reaction and bump shear strength were investigated using 100 /spl mu/m and 50 /spl mu/m size electroplated Pb/ 63 Sn solder bumps. The results demonstrate that the final Cu layer should have a minimum thickness, more than 0. 8 /spl mu/m, for interface stability on CrCu based UBMs. Intermetallic compound growth and CrCu layer interface changes are more severe after 20 min reflow at 210 /spl deg/C compared with 1000 h aging at 125 /spl deg/C.

40|$|Abstract: Wettability {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the integrity of solder joints especially in critical safety operations. It helps in attaining successful soldering and reliable solder joints. The angle of wettability determines the degree of <b>solder</b> <b>contact</b> and strength of the solder joint. Moreover, the contact angle between the solid substrate and the molten solder determines the interconnection reliability. This paper focuses on the wettability of lead free solder on OSP and bare copper substrate surface finishes. The wetting behaviour of lead free solder pastes on bare copper board and Organic Solderability Preservatives (OSPs) substrates were investigated. The test vehicles consist of FR 4 PCB single sided 100 % copper clad with a thick film metallization and FR 4 PCB single sided OSP. The substrate dimension was 100 mm× 160 mm× 1. 6 mm. A total of 480 bumps of Lead-free solder pastes (96 Sn- 3. 8 Ag- 0. 5 Cu and 96. 5 Sn- 3. 0 Ag- 0. 7 Cu alloy composition) were deposited for the investigation. The printing parameters and their values for the experiments include print gap of 0 mm, squeegee speed of 20 mm/s, pressure of 8 kg and separation speed of 3 mm/sec. The pastes are screen printed on the substrates using 0. 125 mm thick stencil mounted on DEK 260 series printing machine.

40|$|The current {{trend for}} multi-functioning miniaturised devices has driven {{research}} and development of higher density electronics. This has a significant impact on electronics packaging, especially in solder joints with reduction in <b>solder</b> <b>contact</b> area. This current trend has placed a challenge in ensuring the reliability of the soldered joint. Concerns on solder joint reliability in terms of its mechanical, electrical, and corrosion behaviour is critical to the operation of the overall electronic device. This work studies the lead-free solder formulation, Fe/Al added Sn- 1. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu (SAC 105) solder alloy, in terms of solder joint integrity exposed to the corrosive environment. Test specimens of printed circuit board (PCB) solder board mounted with solder balls of the mentioned formulations were fabricated. Simulation of corrosive environment using salt mist. A solder ball shear test was performed to observe joint strength (solder/substrate interface). Potentiodynamic polarization was conducted to provide an electrochemical understanding of the corrosion mechanism for these solder alloys in a salt solution. With addition of Al, material experience better passivation that increase the corrosion resistance. The corrosion resistance of Al-added was found better than SAC 105, whilst the Fe added solder was comparable to SAC 105. It {{is interesting to note that}} for Fe-added SAC 105, formation of passivation layer provides resistance towards aqueous environment, which is beneficial as Fe was initially thought to be susceptible to corrosion. Microstructural study and element mapping were carried out to complement the analysis of the potentiodynamic and shear stress studies, especially in correlating the role of intermetallic compounds (IMCs) to mechanical performance. The minor alloying addition of Fe or Al in SAC 105 solder formed intermetallic compounds (IMC) FeSn 2 for Fe-addition, and Al-Cu and Al-Ag for Al addition. The presence of these IMCs have significant impact on mechanical properties after exposure to an aqueous environment. These IMCs, although chemically inert, impose a potential difference between the elements within the alloy and encourage dissolution which results in modification of the mechanical and surface properties. The ball shear test performed has indicated that the addition of Fe/Al to the SAC 105 alloy results in preservation of the joint strength despite excessive exposure to the corrosive environment. Specimens containing solder balls of Fe/Al added SAC 105 have shown to perform similar to SAC 105. The addition of Al has altered the material surface with a more densely-packed corrosion product which hinders the creation of crevices on the surface that may encourage further corrosion. On the other hand, for the case of Fe-added SAC solder, the presence of FeSn 2 IMC through Fe addition created a more noble microstructure within the SAC 105 alloy. Finite element analysis (FEA) simulates the impact of solder ball size on the shear strength of the solder/substrate joint. Conclusively, the evaluation of solder joints of Fe or Al added SAC 105 have shown good mechanical improvement and enhanced corrosion resistance over SAC 105. This demonstrates an improvement of the SAC 105 solder formulation by using cost-effective and commonly available additions such as Fe and Al...|$|E

40|$|Data {{presented}} are {{the culmination}} of experiments studying the combined effects of polarity, contact and current risetime on wire array z-pinches operated on the 1 MA, 100 - 200 ns Cornell University COBRA pulsed power generator. Data were collected on 16 -wire, 12. 5 mu-m phi aluminum z-pinch arrays in both negative and positive polarity, with <b>soldered</b> and non-soldered <b>contacts,</b> and with slow and fast risetimes (100 ns and 200 ns). A minimum of five shots were collected {{for each of the}} eight cases to obtain statistical significance. The initiation, ablation, implosion and stagnation phases were compared for the various cases. Polarity was modified via a 12 nH bolt-on convolute, rotatable to provide positive or negative polarity with similar inductance in each case, allowing sideby-side comparisons. Contact was modified by applying Pb 60 Sn 40 solder to the cathode wire-electrode contact point or leaving the array unsoldered. The current risetime was varied between a 100 ns "short" pulse and 200 ns "long" pulse by utilizing current-pulse shaping capabilities of the COBRA pulsed power generator. These experiments aimed to build upon previous research by Duselis et al. (2004), which showed that polarity, contact and current risetime have significant impact on energy deposited and uniformity of expansion of single wires under low-current (less than 10 kA) conditions. These low current experiments were designed to mimic the conditions on a single wire of a wire-array z-pinch during initiation, also known as the resistive voltage phase. Experiments presented here aim to build upon this research by establishing {{a better understanding of the}} effects of polarity, contact and current risetime on the initiation, ablation, implosion and stagnation phases of wire array z-pinches, and also to understand the utility of low current, single wire results as they pertain to higher current, wire array z-pinches. The data were collected in two separate experimental runs: a preliminary dataset with only contact and current risetime as the variables (four distinct cases), and a second, full dataset examining polarity, contact and current risetime (eight distinct cases). The first dataset showed a significant improvement to long pulse shots when the wires were soldered to the cathode, but no improvements to short pulse shots. Long pulse, soldered shots from this dataset were also observed to exhibit the "Christmas tree" effect, or time-accelerated pinch dynamics at the cathode and axial flow towards the anode. The second dataset showed that, with short pulses only, operating arrays in positive polarity resulted in a 25 % improvement in deposited energy, 30 % smaller achieved current radius, 20 % improvement in peak x-ray power and a 50 % improvement in x-ray yield when compared to negative polarity arrays. <b>Soldering</b> <b>contacts</b> showed a 10 % improvement in initiation energy deposited in positive polarity only, but no subsequent correlated improvement in x-ray yield. Short pulse shots showed a ten-fold increase in peak x-ray powers and yield over long pulse shots. The two datasets were compared, and recommendations for future work were developed...|$|R
40|$|A {{description}} is given of {{a tool for}} laying insulated cables <b>soldered</b> to a <b>contact</b> element at at least one end by a soldering unit that solders the uninsulated cable end to the contact element. The invention is notable for {{a combination of the}} following features: a feed unit feeds the cable to be laid into the operating area of the solder unit and an insulation stripping unit for the cable end to be soldered, has at least one cutting element which cuts through the insulating material of the cable end to be soldered and can be moved towards the cable...|$|R
