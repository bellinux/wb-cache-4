25|$|A <b>socket</b> <b>wrench,</b> more {{commonly}} referred to as a ratchet, is a type of wrench, or tightening tool, that uses separate, removable sockets to fit many different sizes of fittings and fasteners, most commonly nuts and bolts. The ratchet wrench was invented by J.J. Richardson of Woodstock, Vermont, receiving a patent for the ratchet wrench from the Scientific American Patent Agency on June 18, 1863.|$|E
25|$|A {{torque wrench}} {{is a tool}} used to {{precisely}} apply a specific torque to a fastener such as a nut or bolt. It is usually {{in the form of}} a <b>socket</b> <b>wrench</b> with special internal mechanisms. It was invented by Conrad Charles Bahr in 1918. However, it wasn't until much later on March 16, 1937, that Bahr received U.S. patent #2,074,079 for the invention of the torque wrench.|$|E

50|$|A {{breaker bar}} {{is a long}} non-ratcheting bar that is used with <b>socket</b> <b>wrench</b> style sockets. Breaker bars are used to break loose very tight {{fasteners}} because their additional length allows {{the same amount of}} force to generate significantly more torque than a standard length <b>socket</b> <b>wrench.</b> The use of a breaker bar also prevents damage to the ratcheting mechanism of a <b>socket</b> <b>wrench.</b> Often, after the first 1/2 turn of a fastener, the fastener is then loose enough to be turned with a <b>socket</b> <b>wrench.</b>|$|E

5000|$|A ratchet is a {{mechanical}} device that allows continuous linear or rotary motion {{in only one}} direction while preventing motion in the opposite direction. Ratchets are widely used in machinery and tools.

50|$|SK {{was founded}} as the Sherman-Klove Company, specializing in screw-machine products, by Mason H. Sherman and Noah Grover Klove. The company {{was founded in}} the early 20th century to supply munitions in World War I, and made mortar {{housings}} in a screw machine plant on Harrison Street in Chicago. During the 1920s SK operated primarily as a contract company, making tools for other brands (including Craftsman). Business thrived, they made specialty screw machine products that did well until the depression. William S. Sherman (W.S.), Mason's son, came to SK after graduating college in 1927 and was eventually a major owner of the company. One of the products the company made was <b>socket</b> <b>wrenches</b> for Hinsdale <b>Socket</b> and <b>Wrench</b> Company. The Hinsdale Company {{went out of business}} during the great depression leaving Sherman-Klove with a large inventory of this product, they then redesigned the product and changed the company name to S-K Tools.|$|R
50|$|Unlike most <b>socket</b> <b>{{wrenches}},</b> tuning wrenches {{usually have}} a comfortable wood or nylon handle. They are found in two basic shapes: L-shaped and T-shaped. L-shaped handles for pianos are available in several angles that are not quite right angles, provide greater leverage than T-shaped handles, and the angle provides clearance for the handle over adjacent pins, allowing a very short (and stiff) socket to be used. A short, stiff socket enables a better feel {{and control of the}} tiny movements of the tuning pin, within the pin-block. T-shaped handles are used for many lower-tension instruments such as the harpsichord, harp, and dulcimer. T-shaped handles help keep torque parallel to the shaft of the tuning pin, and thus avoid bending the pin and widening the wooden hole that holds the tuning pin.|$|R
5000|$|Williams {{returned}} with a tire iron and a <b>socket</b> <b>wrench,</b> the latter of which he gave to Draper. Draper, seemingly having second thoughts, urged Williams to leave. Williams replied, [...] "I know what I'm doin, I know what I'm doin. Don't worry about it, I know what I'm doin." [...] He then began battering Norwood's head with the tire iron. When he noticed that Draper was frozen in place, Williams said, [...] "Man, you with me? We {{got to do this}} together." [...] Draper then sprung into action himself, striking Norwood repeatedly with the <b>socket</b> <b>wrench.</b> This violent scene continued until Norwood lay motionless and dead." ...|$|E
5000|$|Specialized [...] "wobble" [...] or swivel sockets {{are made}} {{that have a}} {{separate}} socket head and <b>socket</b> <b>wrench</b> connection that allows the socket to wobble or swivel over a limited range independent of the <b>socket</b> <b>wrench</b> or tool position when it {{is attached to the}} bolt or nut. This may be a distinct advantage in some applications with restricted access. These [...] "wobble/swivel" [...] sockets, with their typical ball and socket joint swivel attachments, are made {{in a wide variety of}} types and sizes including deep, shallow, impact, triple square. They are often found in impact sets since they can be built sturdier than a common universal joint socket.|$|E
50|$|After the fire, the Apollo {{program was}} {{grounded}} for review and redesign. The Command Module {{was found to}} be extremely hazardous and, in some instances, carelessly assembled (for example, a misplaced <b>socket</b> <b>wrench</b> was found in the cabin).|$|E
5000|$|There {{are also}} power tool {{versions}} of [...] "air" [...] (pneumatic) ratchets which use compressed air power to drive air powered <b>socket</b> <b>wrenches</b> which tighten or loosen nuts or bolts. A second major variety of compressed air powered tools are impact wrenches {{which are used}} for common tasks such as lug nuts on wheels. Electric powered impact wrenches for the same tasks are not uncommon. Small cordless 12 volt and 18 volt impact drivers are often used today as powered ratchets to remove and install nuts and bolts. Hydraulic motor ratchets with their characteristic higher torque are rare outside heavy industry. The sockets used for impact duty (called [...] "impact sockets") are made with thicker walls and tempered to a lower hardness {{so as not to}} shatter under the impacts of the impact tool. They are typically finished in black oxide rather than the usual chrome plating of the hand-tool variety. Standard sockets (i.e. non-impact sockets) may shatter if used with impact wrenches, presenting a safety risk.|$|R
50|$|A third {{common type}} of wrench {{utilizes}} a metal or plastic cup that is shaped much like a socket. The cup {{is placed on the}} end of the filter, which engages the knurling. A <b>socket</b> or <b>wrench</b> is then used to loosen the filter. Volkswagen Group and BMW cars require this type of wrench to remove their filters (or the lid of the filter housing, where a non-cartridge filter is used).|$|R
50|$|In general, all {{hand tools}} are {{warrantied}} for their entire lifetime. For example, if one breaks (under normal use) a <b>socket</b> or torque <b>wrench</b> fails, Canadian Tire will replace it. There are some {{exceptions to the}} warranty. For instance, {{when it comes to}} tape measures only the shell is warranted and not the tape itself.|$|R

5000|$|Impact {{wrenches}} {{are available}} in every standard <b>socket</b> <b>wrench</b> drive size, from small ¼" [...] drive tools for small assembly and disassembly, up to 3½" [...] and larger square drives for major construction.

They both meet Dusty and Flicker as they overheard them. They {{each has}} six sides like fixing Marcelo's bike. They {{are one of}} the automobic team.|$|E
50|$|Tuning <b>wrench</b> <b>sockets</b> may be square shaped or 8-pointed star shaped, and {{are found}} in two basic sizes: a large size for pianos, and a smaller size for most other instruments. For pianos, there are some {{gradations}} of size, and several lengths are generally available, and unlike machine-screw sockets which have no taper, piano sockets have a slight taper, to fit tapered tuning pins. Impact piano tuning levers differ from traditional levers {{in that they are}} fitted with a weight {{at the end of the}} handle. The tuner flicks the lever with his or her wrist, causing the weight to do the actual work of moving the tuning pin. Tuning <b>wrench</b> <b>sockets</b> are often attached snugly to the handle with fine-gauge machine-screw threads, to provide a very firm, immobile joint; this is contrast to the square snap-on joints found in sockets used for machinery.|$|R
40|$|The {{tethering}} of <b>sockets</b> and <b>wrenches</b> {{was accomplished}} {{to improve the}} safety of working over motor segments. To accomplish the tethering of the sockets to the ratchets, a special design was implemented in which a groove was machined into each socket. Each socket was then fitted with a snap ring that can spin around the machined groove. The snap ring is tethered to {{the handle of the}} ratchet. All open end wrenches are also tethered to the ratchet or to the operator, depending upon the type. Tests were run to ensure that the modified tools meet torque requirements. The design was subsequently approved by Space Safety...|$|R
50|$|A {{hydraulic}} {{torque wrench}} {{is a power}} tool designed to exert torque on a fastener to achieve proper tightening or loosening of a connection {{through the use of}} hydraulics. A torque wrench is applied to the nut either directly or in conjunction with an impact <b>socket.</b> Hydraulic torque <b>wrenches</b> apply a predetermined, controlled amount of torque to a properly lubricated fastener.|$|R
