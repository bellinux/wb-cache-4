5|$|A {{number of}} {{attempts}} were made to locate the remains of Yagan's body, which were believed to be on Lot 39 West Swan Road in the outer Perth suburb of Belhus. A remote sensing <b>survey</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site was carried out in 1998, but no remains were found. An archaeological <b>survey</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area was undertaken two years later, but this also was unsuccessful. Disputes then arose over whether the head could be buried separately from the body. Wilkes has claimed that it can, so long as it is placed where Yagan was killed, so that Dreamtime spirits can reunite the remains.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his return}} to California, Col.

The board, which {{became known as the}} Alexander Commission, conducted a <b>survey</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> California Central Valley throughout the summer and fall of 1873. The Commission's report declared that large-scale irrigation was possible and that much land could be reclaimed from the swamps around the Sacramento River. The report was not initially acted upon, but was the first professional <b>survey</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> valley and set the stage for further development.|$|E

5|$|The Burial Council's core {{contention}} is the city's decision {{to conduct an}} archaeological <b>survey</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rail line's route in phases, meaning construction on {{a majority of the}} line will be complete by the time the survey in the Kakaako area is performed, which in turn increases the likelihood that any remains discovered will be moved instead of being allowed to remain in situ. In response to the Burial Council's concerns, the city agreed to begin conducting an archaeological <b>survey</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area in 2010, two years earlier than originally planned. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources later signed the city's programmatic agreement on January 15, 2011, over the continuing concerns of the Burial Council.|$|E
