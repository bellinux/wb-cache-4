5|$|The {{music video}} begins as police {{officers}} and Reddick discuss the criminal duo and ways to catch them. As the song begins, Jay-Z is seen driving a gunmetal grey Aston Martin while Beyoncé sits in the passenger seat. As they drive through the sepia sands of Mexico, clips of the police {{from the beginning of}} the video are cut into the scene. As Jay-Z and Beyoncé pull over to a hotel, they cover the car to avoid notice from the police. As Beyoncé and Jay-Z count money in the bedroom, the police discover their hiding place and go upstairs only to find that the two have fled the scene in their car. Scenes of Beyoncé and Jay-Z at a Mexican bar are inter-cut with scenes of an intimate time in a phone-booth; behind the phone booth, spray-painted onto a wall is a tribute to Tupac Shakur. The duo again elude the police who are following one <b>step</b> <b>behind.</b> After Beyoncé performs her verse in an empty pool, the police form a blockade on the highway in an attempt to catch her and Jay-Z, only to be stumped again as two gas station attendant decoys are found driving the car. The video ends as Beyoncé and Jay-Z light a bonfire on the beach and drive away in a different car.|$|E
25|$|Reviews {{note the}} theme of violence. The novel {{examines}} some of the social causes for the violence depicted. The Guardian pointed out the irony {{that the state is}} working to execute Granville Oliver against Washingtonians' consensus when so many other African American men die on the street. and called this an original argument against the death penalty. The New York Times compared the depiction of violence growing from smaller actions to the work of Richard Price. Pelecanos has described the book as an anti-detective novel because no case is solved by the private investigators and they are constantly a <b>step</b> <b>behind</b> the police.|$|E

This and the Hasty Pudding Club, an organization for performing amateur theatricals, are the two lions of Harvard. The Porcellian Club is hardly a place of resort for those who cultivate the intellect {{at the expense of the}} body. The list of active members is small, owing in part to the largeness of the annual subscription. The great desire of every student is to become a member of it... the doings of the club are shrouded in secrecy... All that can be said by a stranger who has been privileged to <b>step</b> <b>behind</b> the scenes is that the mysteries are rites which can be practised without much labor and yield a pleasure which is fraught with no unpleasant consequences.|$|E

25|$|If {{the symbol}} width is n, the codes of width n+1 fall {{naturally}} into two blocks: the lower block of 2n codes for coding single symbols, {{and the upper}} block of 2n codes {{that will be used}} by the decoder for sequences of length greater than one. Of that upper block, the first two codes are already taken: 2n for CLEAR and 2n + 1 for STOP. The decoder must also be prevented from using the last code in the upper block, 2n+1 − 1, because when the decoder fills that slot, it will increase the code width. Thus in the upper block there are 2n − 3 codes available to the decoder that won't trigger an increase in code width. Because the decoder is always one <b>step</b> <b>behind</b> in maintaining the table, it does not generate a table entry upon receiving the first code from the encoder, but will generate one for each succeeding code. Thus the encoder can generate 2n − 2 codes without triggering an increase in code width. Therefore the encoder must emit extra CLEAR codes at intervals of 2n − 2 codes or less to make the decoder reset the coding dictionary. The GIF standard allows such extra CLEAR codes to be inserted in the image data at any time. The composite data stream is partitioned into sub-blocks that each carry from 1 to 255 bytes.|$|E

500|$|Film theorist David Roche {{writes that}} Lynch films do not simply tell detective stories, but rather force the {{audience}} {{into the role}} of becoming detectives themselves {{to make sense of the}} narratives, and that Mulholland Drive, like other Lynch films, frustrates [...] "the spectator's need for a rational diegesis by playing on the spectator's mistake that narration is synonymous with diegesis". In Lynch's films, the spectator is always [...] "one <b>step</b> <b>behind</b> narration" [...] and thus [...] "narration prevails over diegesis". Roche also notes that there are multiple mysteries in the film that ultimately go unanswered by the characters who meet dead ends, like Betty and Rita, or give in to pressures as Adam does. Although the audience still struggles to make sense of the stories, the characters are no longer trying to solve their mysteries. Roche concludes that Mulholland Drive is a mystery film not because it allows the audience to view the solution to a question, but the film itself is a mystery that is held together [...] "by the spectator-detective's desire to make sense" [...] of it.|$|E

[...] She later went on to say that she regrets leaving the show, [...] "Oh yeah, sometimes, yeah. You miss it. I miss my friends. It was a great work environment ... and it becomes a family. I spent six years together with these people every day ... you grow up together, in a way," [...] and again commented on Izzie possibly returning to the show, [...] "I always felt that if they wanted me to come back and sort of wrap up that storyline ... I want them to know that I'm down with it if they want me to, but I completely understand if it doesn't necessarily work ... They've got a lot of story lines going on there." [...] But in March 2012, Shonda Rhimes said that there are no plans at the moment for the character to return, [...] "I think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. At the same time we are on a track we have been planning. The idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now." [...] Three years later, Rhimes said she has completely moved on from the idea of Izzie coming back, “I’m done with that story. I’ve turned that idea over in my mind a thousand times and thought about how it would go. And I don’t think so.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Chemarea survived until November 1, 1919—when its lampoon of Romanian King Ferdinand I {{prompted}} {{the intervention of}} military censors. On November 2, shortly before the general election day, Cocea profited from the temporary suspension of censorship to reissue the same paper, subsequently renamed Chemarea Roșie ("The Red Call"), then Facla, Torța ("The Torch"), Clopotul ("The Bell") and again Chemarea (changes which were supposed to keep censors always a <b>step</b> <b>behind</b> Cocea). These publications were attempts to revive and radicalize the socialist literary press, that had virtually succumbed in Romania after the demise of Faclas first edition. A Marxist literary critic, Ovid Crohmălniceanu, proposes that Cocea's renewed offensive missed the mark, lacking [...] "a clear enough vision".|$|E

According to Cernat, young Iovanaki shared with Tzara and Tzara's mentor Adrian Maniu an [...] "acute awareness of the literary convention" [...] and a bookish boredom with aestheticism; the three also borrowed [...] "obviously" [...] from Alfred Jarry and Jules Laforgue.

2500|$|In late December 2008, reports {{began to}} surface of {{possible}} [...] "inappropriate conduct" [...] {{in relation to}} the death of a [...] "presumed insurgent". The Canadian Forces National Investigation Service investigated the incident, resulting in second-degree murder charges against Captain Robert Semrau on 31 December 2008. According to court documents released on 6 January 2009, Captain Semrau, who was serving with NATO's Operational Mentoring and Liaison Team supervising and mentoring Afghan soldiers in Helmand Provence, is alleged to have killed a wounded insurgent found by Afghan National Army troops after they came under a Taliban ambush on 19 October 2008. According to the [...] "detention review synopsis" [...] filed by Crown prosecutor Major Marylene Trudel, Afghan soldiers found a man whose wounds [...] "appeared too severe for any type of treatment in situ" [...] and disarmed him. [...] The statement goes on to allege that Semrau was seen near the wounded man when two shots were heard. The document states that [...] "After evaluating all available evidence, the prosecution believes that it was Captain Semrau who fired both shots, that these shots resulted in the death of the severely wounded insurgent and that Captain Semrau had no lawful justification for shooting the severely wounded insurgent". The prosecution also claimed that it would produce a witness who would testify that he saw Semrau shoot the wounded man. The body of the man was left behind {{at the scene of the}} ambush and was never found. Major Trudel added that the charges against Captain Semrau could change and that the prosecution was [...] "still a <b>step</b> <b>behind</b> that process." ...|$|E
