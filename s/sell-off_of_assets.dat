40|$|I {{have always}} been {{interested}} in the twists and turns of education policy. It’s tempting to dismiss a lot of it scornfully, as the ravings of some semi-informed nutters. But the hard reality is that education is a very difficult area of policy and one in which it is hard to make an impact quickly. The political cycle (4 years) frequently demands quicker results than can be produced – and few education ministers progress to serious high office. Thatcher I suppose has to be considered an exception. But her education policy is itself revealing. If there is a single political idea with which she will forever be associated, it is ‘privatisation’. Her central belief was that governments should not run utility companies – since she believed they could be more efficiently run in the private sector.

However, the change in the wealth of the selling firm's shareholders for U. S. buyers was not significantly different from that for non-U. S. buyers. Since no advance is indicated for foreign buyers over domestic buyers, laws or regulations hindering the foreign acquisition of U. S. real estate cannot be supported.

40|$|Trade {{breaks down}} {{in the market for}} lemons because high-type sellers have a {{reservation}} value greater than expected market value. Unraveling occurs and only the lowest types trade. Two related questions arise: What happens the next day? And, from where does the reservation value come? We model these considerations in a dynamic setting with gradual arrival of noisy information. We characterize the unique equilibrium in a continuous-time framework. The equilibrium involves a region of no trade or market failure. The no-trade region ends in one of two ways: either enough good news arrives restoring confidence and markets re-open or bad news arrives making buyers more pessimistic forcing market capitulation i. e., a <b>sell-off</b> <b>of</b> low value <b>assets.</b> Reservation values arise endogenously from the option to sell in the future. Our model also encompasses dynamic signaling environments.

Following the 1997 – 1998 Asian financial crises, many East Asian governments moved to accumulate large amounts of reserves to serve as collateral for their domestic financial systems and prevent future currency crises (Figure 1).

50|$|In 1993, Sears {{terminated}} {{its famous}} general merchandise catalog because of sinking sales and profits. Sears Holdings continues to produce specialty catalogs and reintroduced a smaller {{version of the}} Holiday Wish Book in 2007. In 2003, Sears sold its retail credit card operation to Citibank. The remaining card operations were sold to JPMorgan Chase in August 2005. In 2003, Sears opened a new concept store called Sears Grand. Sears Grand stores carry everything that a regular Sears carries, and more. Sears Grand stores are about 175000 to 225000 sq ft. On November 17, 2004, Sears announced it was being acquired by Kmart. As {{a part of the}} acquisition, Kmart Holdings Corporation changed its name to Sears Holdings. The new corporation announced that it would continue to operate stores under both the Sears and Kmart brands. In 2005, the company began renovating some Kmart stores and converting them to the Sears Essentials format, only to change them later to Sears Grands. Sears spent much of 2014 and 2015 selling off portions of its balance sheet; namely Lands' End and its stake in Sears Canada. Sears Canada {{is one of the biggest}} e-commerce players in Canada, with CAN$505 million in sales in 2015—more than Walmart and others who have begun pushing aggressively into online sales, such as Canadian Tire. Sears states that the company is looking to focus on becoming a more tech-driven retailer. Sears' CEO and top shareholder said the <b>sell-off</b> <b>of</b> key <b>assets</b> in the last year has given the retailer the money it needs to speed up its transformation. Sears Holdings has lost a total of US$7 billion in the last four years. In part, the retailer is trying to curb losses by using a loyalty program called Shop Your Way.

40|$|In {{the course}} of the recent {{financial}} crisis, the issue <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> valuation has regularly moved to center stage, due both to the sharp fluctuations observed in numerous assets, making economic measurement difficult, but also to the impact that fluctuations can have on the behaviour of economic agents that are required to submit annual financial statements –or even interim or quarterly ones. While this issue has not been seen as the cause of the latest crisis, it has nonetheless been considered as a potential source of its increasing magnitude, even though –at the time of this writing (early July) – we have not yet seen any massive <b>sell-offs</b> <b>of</b> major <b>asset</b> classes (equities or bonds, corporate issues in particular). The question <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> and liability valuation is of particular concern for the insurance industry. Because of the specific characteristics of this industry, valuation poses specifi c problems which, far from being fully different compared to the other sectors –the banking industry in particular– in fact tend to be magnified. In fact, {{it is no accident that}} the only sector to be granted a transition regime in the application of new international accounting standards is the insurance industry, due to difficulties encountered by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) in finding a workable solution for the valuation of insurance liabilities. Similarly, it is no accident that the Internet meltdown was suddenly aggravated in 2002 - 2003 by the massive move on the part of insurance and reinsurance companies to liquidate their equity portfolios when, once a certain downward price threshold had been surpassed, they decided it was time to sell rather than face the consequences of further depreciation in equity prices on their balance sheets and their solvency margins. The memory of this last event, which without any warning whatsoever took on the proportions of a systemic risk for the global fi nancial sector, recently came to mind when the fall in equity prices picked up speed globally in light of soaring oil prices and an uptick in infl ation. Accordingly, the issue <b>of</b> insurance <b>asset</b> and liability valuation does not just pose a microeconomic problem in terms of assessing the financial strength of insurance and reinsurance companies. It also poses a macroeconomic problem in terms of financing the economy and ensuring financial stability. In the rest of this article, we will examine the economic problems posed by the valuation of insurance and reinsurance assets and liabilities. Then, we will analyse the relevance of today’s competing accounting standards, concluding that they offer a very imperfect resolution to the challenges of insurance valuation. Finally, we will analyse the consequences of these problems for financial stability –in terms of the solvency of companies, the financing of the economy, and the ability to absorb shocks to the system. We will conclude that they are signifi cantly greater than is often imagined. ...|$|R

40|$|Events in Argentina {{dominated}} most of {{the third}} quarter of 2001 until September 11, when the terrorist attacks against the United States prompted a <b>sell-off</b> <b>of</b> emerging markets <b>assets,</b> increasing uncertainty and risk aversion against a background of global economic slowdown. Emerging markets' short term prospects to tap international capital markets deteriorated significantly. In the third quarter of 2001, Latin American countries issued US$ 7. 6 billion in bonds, following US$ 11. 2 billion in the second quarter and US$ 13. 2 billion in the first quarter, which had been a jump from only US$ 2. 9 billion {{in the last quarter of}} 2000. At first, it seemed that the pace of debt issuance would slow down considerably given Argentina's troubles in July, as Argentina's bond auction at the beginning of the month was poorly received, forcing the government to shorten the maturity of the new debt and to pay rates as high as those during the Russian crisis in 1998. By August, however, emerging markets rebounded strongly on the back of a new US$ 8 billion IMF assistance package to Argentina, with both Mexico and Brazil successfully launching large issues. International markets displayed considerable flexibility as investors gave Mexico's US$ 1. 5 billion 30 - year bond and Brazil's JPY 200 billion two-year samurai issue a warm reception. This return to capital markets was interrupted by the events of September 11, which caused debt issuance to fall sharply in September and October.
