These are principally developmental delays and language disorders associated with neglect. Conduct disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and social phobia share many <b>symptoms</b> <b>and</b> are often comorbid with or confused with RAD. Attachment disorder behaviors amongst institutionalized children are correlated with attentional and conduct problems and cognitive levels but nonetheless appear to index a distinct set of <b>symptoms</b> <b>and</b> behaviors.|$|E

40|$|Objective - The aim of {{this study}} was to assess <b>symptom</b> {{frequency}} <b>and</b> <b>symptom</b> distress associated with adverse effects of immunosuppressive therapy in kidney transplant recipients and to correlate it with compliance and socio-demographic characteristics. Methods - <b>Symptom</b> frequency <b>and</b> <b>symptom</b> distress were evaluated by the ‘Adapted Transplant <b>Symptom</b> Frequency <b>and</b> <b>Symptom</b> Distress Scale’. Data were collected from 85 patients who had undergone a kidney transplant between 1995 and 1997. Results - Women reported a significantly higher level of <b>symptom</b> frequency <b>and</b> <b>symptom</b> distress when compared with men. The most frequent symptoms reported by women were changed appearance and increased hair growth, whereas for men were increased appetite and ‘moon face’. Nevertheless the most distressing symptoms for women were painful menstruation and insomnia and for men were impotence and decreased interest in sex. Concerning compliance the non-compliant group reported a higher level of <b>symptom</b> frequency <b>and</b> <b>symptom</b> distress when compared with the compliant group. These results suggest that complications caused by symptoms associated with the adverse effects of immunosuppressive therapy are perceived differently by men and women and may induce non-compliance. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

Acta Neurol Scand: DOI: 10. 1111 /j. 1600 - 0404. 2010. 01478. x. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Objectives - Many severe strokes are preceded by warning signs such as a transient ischemic attack or stroke with minor deficits. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) of a symptomatic carotid artery stenosis can prevent future strokes, but should be performed within 2 weeks after the initial symptom to maximize the benefit. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the time delays between <b>symptom</b> <b>and</b> CEA. Methods- We performed a single center observational retrospective study at a tertiary stroke center. A total of 142 carotids in 139 patients with symptomatic stenoses between 2002 and 2006 were included. The main outcome measure was time between qualifying cerebrovascular <b>symptom</b> <b>and</b> CEA. Results - The median time between <b>symptom</b> <b>and</b> CEA was 26 days. The longest delays were between the last diagnostic examination and carotid conference, and between carotid conference and surgery. The median time was shorter for those who received emergency medical care (median 21 days) and for those who were admitted immediately to hospital (median 20 days). Conclusions - The time between <b>symptom</b> <b>and</b> surgery is often longer than desirable. There are several measures to improve the chain of procedures for patients with carotid artery stenosis. These may include omitting the formal carotid conference for uncomplicated cases and minimizing waiting time for surgery...|$|R

30|$|In this study, we {{collected}} the data by self-reported questionnaires and clinical and functional examinations: (1) TMJ pain during function(mouth opening or mastication), (2) TMJ noise on jaw movement, (3) LOM under 35  mm. The study group {{were examined in}} three times: before the preceding treatments for TMD, before surgery and 6  months after surgery. The control group were examined in two times: before surgery and 6  months after surgery. Self-reported questionnaire consisted of several questions regarding the subjective changes of TMJ <b>symptoms.</b> Clinical <b>and</b> functional examinations were performed for the diagnosis of TMD according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD (RDC/TMD) Axis I [14]. The severity of TMJ pain and noise was rated on Numerical Analogue Scales (NAS) composed of 11 rating points. The NAS ranged from 0 to 10 with 0 indicating ‘no <b>symptom</b> <b>and</b> sign’, 10 representing ‘worst possible <b>symptom</b> <b>and</b> sign’, and 5 documenting an intermediate level at ‘moderate <b>symptom</b> <b>and</b> sign’. The change of LOM was evaluated as three grades: ‘improvement (+)’, ‘deterioration (-)’, and ‘no change (0)’.|$|R
