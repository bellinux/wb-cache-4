In contrast to many available semi-analytic solutions for residual autofrettage <b>stresses</b> <b>and</b> strains, the von Mises yield criterion and its associated flow rule are adopted. A remarkable property of the solution found is that the residual <b>stresses</b> <b>and</b> strains in the white layer can be determined without solving the strain equations in the plastic region. Therefore, the solution is rather simple. In particular, numerical techniques are only necessary to solve transcendental and ordinary differential equations...|$|R

30|$|When {{concrete}} slabs {{are subjected to}} loads, bearing <b>stresses</b> <b>and</b> deflection are mainly affected by the spacing of dowel bars. Decreased dowel bar spacing results in the reduction in bearing <b>stresses</b> <b>and</b> deflection. However, if dowel bar spacing decreases to less than 203  mm (8  in), a horizontal plane of weakness in the concrete slab at the joint face will occur. On the contrary, the increased dowel bar spacing leads to excessive bearing <b>stresses</b> <b>and</b> deflection at the joint. Currently, most highway agencies have adopted a 305  mm (12  in) spacing requirement, which also depends on the slab thickness and subgrade conditions.|$|R
