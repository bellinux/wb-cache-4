A generalized formulation to describe the nearly-off-axis transmissivity of a Sole birefringent filter is derived. On this basis, the polarization conoscopic figures of Sole filters with different numbers of birefringent plates are simulated. Furthermore the variation of spectral transmission with angle of incidence is analyzed, and the field-of-view transmissivity and the <b>spectral</b> <b>transmissivity</b> averaged {{with respect to the}} spread of incident light are given.

40|$|A multivariable and multiobjective organic light {{emitting}} diode (OLED) design and optimization procedure is presented that produces a microcavity OLED with optimal optical and electrical characteristics. We propose here a design procedure that splits the design process into two design stages where each stage can be optimized independently. In the first stage we design the OLED with optimal electrical and optical performance, where the mirrors are specified by their optimal <b>spectral</b> reflectivity, <b>transmissivity,</b> absorptance, and the phase shift on reflection. In the second stage we synthesize the top and the bottom multilayer mirrors with a minimal number of layers that satisfy the required optimal spectral dependencies determined {{in the first part of}} the design process. As a case study we present an optimized design for a top-emitting OLED with a simple bilayered cavity consisting of N, N 2 ̆ 7 -di(naphthalene- 1 -yi) -N, N 2 ̆ 7 -diphenylbenzidine (NPB) as the hole transport layer and tris(8 -hydroxyquinoline) aluminium (Alq(3)) as the electron transport layer. Conventional devices with an ITO-LiF/Al electrode pair and a Ag-Ag electrode pair are used as reference devices to benchmark the performance of our design. Electrical simulations using the drift-diffusion model and optical simulations employing the integrated dipole antenna approach are implemented to test the performance of the devices. The optimized device shows improved optical and electrical performance when compared with the reference devices. (c) 2009 Optical Society of Americ...|$|R
40|$|Spectral optical layer {{properties}} of cirrus {{are derived from}} simultaneous and vertically collocated measurements of spectral upward and downward solar irradiance {{above and below the}} cloud layer and concurrent in situ microphysical sampling. From the irradiance data <b>spectral</b> <b>transmissivity,</b> absorptivity, reflectivity, and cloud top albedo of the observed cirrus layer are obtained.

The close collocation of the radiative and microphysical measurements, above, beneath and inside the cirrus, is obtained by using a research aircraft (Learjet 35 A) in tandem with a towed platform called AIRTOSS (AIRcraft TOwed Sensor Shuttle). AIRTOSS can be released from and retracted back to the research aircraft by means of a cable up to a distance of 4 km.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} one of {{the first}} studies of the degradation of retrofit light bulbs based on white GaN light emitting diodes. The results indicate that the lifetime of LED lamps depends mostly on the stability of the driver and optical elements, rather than on the degradation of the LED chips, that have a stable output over stress time. By comparing lamps from four different manufacturers stressed at room and high temperature, we found that (i) long-term stress causes a change of the chromatic properties of the lamps, which is ascribed to the degradation of the phosphors or to the inner LED reflector; (ii) during aging the LED driver may degrade gradually and/or catastrophically, causing a reduction of the output optical power, or a complete failure; (iii) proper thermal management and heat dissipation reduce the degradation rate; (iv) <b>spectral</b> <b>transmissivity</b> measurements and visual inspection reveal the degradation of the diffusive optical elements, which is induced by the short wavelength side of the LED emission spectrum. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

After the intramuscular injection of 2. 1 X 10 (13 - 2. 1 X 10 (16) molecules of [3 H]vitamin A, ocular tissue showed a rapid rate of uptake of label which reached a maximum level of incorporation by 48 h. Light- microscopic autoradiography revealed that the retinal uptake of label was concentrated within the receptor outer segments. <b>Spectral</b> <b>transmissivity</b> measurements at various times after injection were made upon intact retinas and upon digitonin extracts. They showed that visual pigment with a lambdamax of 504 nm was formed in the retina and that the amount formed was a function of incubation time and {{the magnitude of the}} dose administered. Electrophysiological measures of photoreceptor light responses were obtained from the PIII component of the electroretinogram, isolated with aspartate.

40|$|Development of TarVIP 1. 0, a {{computer}} model for predicting the detection distances of normal and UV activated pavement markings was recently completed at the Operator Performance Laboratory (OPL). Two Sherwin-Williams UV activated pavement marking samples, four UV headlamp units (Ultralux, Visteon, Cibio and Labino brands), and the UV filter covering the Labino UV headlamp unit were characterized {{in terms of their}} fluorescence coefficients, spectral emissions, and <b>spectral</b> <b>transmissivity,</b> respectively. The TarVIP model properly accounts for a complete three-dimensional representation of the roadway-headlamp-driver geometry. Veiling luminance due to fog is modeled using the Mie Scattering theory. The model consists of physical and human performance subsystems. Besides the aforementioned physical subsystem items, the human performance subsystem uses an extensive human visibility contrast threshold database to represent the human capabilities and limitations of pavement marking detection. The model was used to obtain the visibility distances under various levels of fog density, UV activated pavement marking and UV headlamp efficiencies. The resulting visibility distances show some potential benefits and some inadequacies of the UV headlamps and UV activated pavement markings. The computer model TarVIP was developed to obtain INTRODUCTION estimates of nighttime detection distances for conventiona...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{maximize}} sensitivity, optical space surveillance sensors use detectors that have good sensitivity {{over a wide}} region of the spectrum. For example, the CCD detectors for the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) Project, which are nearly identical to the detectors of the Ground-based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance System, have good sensitivity over the visible spectrum from 380 nanometers to beyond 1000 nanometers. However, photometric calibration of the intensities of objects (stars, satellites, asteroids, etc.) measured by these systems must be referenced to astronomical star catalogs that were measured over much narrower portions of the available spectrum. For example, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Photometric Database contains photometric measurements in five bandpasses that are each about 150 nanometers wide. This paper will present a method for converting between photometric systems with different bandpasses. The method uses the measured response functions of the detectors of interest along with {{a model of the}} <b>spectral</b> <b>transmissivity</b> of the atmosphere (Stone, 1996), and a catalog of stellar spectra (Pickles, 1998) to derive polynomial functions that allow for the conversion of brightness measurements from astronomical catalogs to the bandpass of the sensor. The method has been extensively tested using data from the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research project in comparison with catalog measurements from the USNO B 1. 0 astrometric catalog, and the SDSS Photometric Database.

40|$|Spectral {{upward and}} {{downward}} solar irradiances from vertically collocated measurements {{above and below}} a cirrus layer are used to derive cirrus optical layer properties such as <b>spectral</b> <b>transmissivity,</b> absorptivity, reflectivity, and cloud top albedo. The radiation measurements are complemented by in situ cirrus crystal size distribution measurements and radiative transfer simulations based on the microphysical data. The close collocation of the radiative and microphysical measurements, above, beneath, and inside the cirrus, is accomplished by using a research aircraft (Learjet 35 A) {{in tandem with the}} towed sensor platform AIRTOSS (AIRcraft TOwed Sensor Shuttle). AIRTOSS can be released from and retracted back to the research aircraft by means of a cable up to a distance of 4  km. Data were collected from two field campaigns over the North Sea and the Baltic Sea in spring and late summer 2013. One measurement flight over the North Sea proved to be exemplary, and as such the results are used to illustrate the benefits of collocated sampling. The radiative transfer simulations were applied to quantify the impact of cloud particle properties such as crystal shape, effective radius r eff, and optical thickness τ on cirrus spectral optical layer properties. Furthermore, the radiative effects of low-level, liquid water (warm) clouds as frequently observed beneath the cirrus are evaluated. They may cause changes in the radiative forcing of the cirrus by a factor of 2. When low-level clouds below the cirrus are not taken into account, the radiative cooling effect (caused by reflection of solar radiation) due to the cirrus in the solar (shortwave) spectral range is significantly overestimated...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{spectral}} solar zenith radiances are analyzed which {{were obtained from}} ship-based measurements over the Atlantic ocean. In combination with high-resolution lidar and microwave remote sensing optical and microphysical cloud properties were retrieved using spectral radiation data. To overcome problems of existing transmissivity-based cloud retrievals, a new retrieval algorithm is introduced which circumvents retrieval ambiguities and reduces the influence of measurement uncertainties. The method matches radiation measurements of ratios of <b>spectral</b> <b>transmissivity</b> at six wavelengths with modeled transmissivities. The new retrieval method is fast and accurate, and thus suitable for operational purposes. It is applied to homogeneous and inhomogeneous liquid water and cirrus clouds. The results from the new algorithm are compared to observations of liquid water path obtained from a microwave radiometer, yielding an overestimation for thick liquid water clouds but a slight underestimation for thin clouds. A statistical analysis of retrieved cloud properties during three Atlantic transects is introduced. Similar characteristics of cloud properties {{are found in the}} mid latitudes and northern subtropics but the large variability of meridional distribution in the remaining regions imply the prevailing influence of weather systems compared to typical cloud distributions. With about 63 % homogeneous stratocumulus clouds are found to be the prevailing cloud type over ocean, while scattered and inhomogeneous liquid water clouds amount to 16 % and 21 %, respectively. All analyzed distributions are affected by an increased frequency of small values of cloud properties caused by 3 D radiative effects. The comparison with satellite-based and ship-based cloud retrievals along the cruise track show comparable results for the cloud optical thickness with limitations for thick liquid water clouds. The meridional distribution of effective radius agreed within the uncertainties of both methods, however, the satellite-derived values are biased toward larger mean values...|$|E

The CIRS {{software}} can handle any infrared (IR) sounder data. Compared to the original retrieval, it uses improved radiative transfer modelling, accounts for atmospheric <b>spectral</b> <b>transmissivity</b> changes associated with CO 2 concentration and incorporates the lat-est ancillary data (atmospheric profiles, surface temperature and emissivities). The global cloud amount {{is estimated to be}} 0. 67 – 0. 70, for clouds with IR optical depth larger than about 0. 1. The spread of 0. 03 is associated with ancillary data. Cloud amount is partitioned into about 40 % high-level clouds, 40 % low-level clouds and 20 % mid-level clouds. The latter two categories are only detected in the absence of upper clouds. The A-Train active instruments, lidar and radar of the CALIPSO and CloudSat missions, provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the retrieved AIRS cloud properties. CIRS cloud height can be approximated either by the mean layer height (for optically thin clouds) or by the mean between cloud top and the height at which the cloud reaches opacity. This is valid for high-level as well as for low-level clouds identified by CIRS. IR sounders are particularly advantageous to retrieve upper-tropospheric cloud properties, with a reliable cirrus identification, day and night. These clouds are most abundant in the tropics, where high opaque clouds make up 7. 5 %, thick cirrus 27. 5 % and thin cirrus about 21. 5 % of all clouds. The 5 % annual mean excess in high-level cloud amount in the Northern compared to the Southern Hemisphere has a pronounced seasonal cycle with a maximum of 25 % in boreal summer, in accordance with the moving of the ITCZ peak latitude, with annual mean of 4 °N, to a maximum of 12 °N. This suggests that this excess is mainly determined by the position of the ITCZ. Considering interannual variability, tropical cirrus are more frequent relative to all clouds when the global (or tropical) mean surface gets warmer. Changes in relative amount of tropical high opaque and thin cirrus with respect to mean surface temperature show different geographical patterns, suggesting that their response to climate change might differ...|$|E
40|$|Despite that {{combustion}} diagnostics {{have reached}} {{high levels of}} refinement, it remains difficult to make quantitatively accurate nonintrusive measurements of temperature and species concentrations in realistic combustion environments. The goal {{of the present study}} is to develop nonintrusive spectral radiation tools to allow efficient high-fidelity determination of temperature and species concentrations in laminar and turbulent combustion systems. Temperature and concentrations are deduced from medium-to-coarse resolution measurements of <b>spectral</b> <b>transmissivity</b> and emitted intensity for homogeneous gas media, nonhomogeneous gas media and turbulent systems considering the turbulence radiation interaction (TRI). For a homogeneous gas medium, by minimizing the differences between measured and predicted transmissivity spectra, an inverse radiation model is developed to retrieve temperature and species concentrations simultaneously using the the Levenberg-Marquardt optimization method. This model has been validated by experimental measurements. The developed inverse radiation model is used to determine the optimal wavenumber range and resolution by retrieving temperature and species concentrations from a homogeneous gas column {{for a wide range of}} temperatures and concentrations. Multiple factors, including spectral region, spectral resolution, temperature and concentration range, and susceptibility to systematic error and random error have been considered. Results are obtained for homogeneous mixtures containing CO 2, H 2 O or CO with N 2. In nonhomogeneous gas media, transmissvities are not sensitive to temperature and concentration distributions, making it impossible to reconstruct temperature and species concentrations fields from transmissivity spectra. Another inverse calculation model is developed using measured line-of-sight emitted spectral intensity data to retrieve temperature profiles. Because intensity spectra are also not sensitive to concentration profiles, this model can only deduce the temperature profile together with an average concentration. Due to the ill-posedness of this inverse problem, additional conditions or criteria are needed to be imposed to determine the most realistic solution. Most regularization methods transform an ill-posed inverse problem into a well-behaved one by adding auxiliary information based on desired or assumed characteristics. Tikhonov regularization imposes smoothness to the solution by adding a regularization term. Tikhonov regularization has been shown to be suitable for solving these ill-posed problems, but it is difficult to select an appropriate regularization parameter, especially for nonlinear problems. A new regularization selection method based on the theory of the discrepancy principle and the L-curve criterion is proposed and shows good generality for different temperature profile inversions. Several types of temperature profiles are retrieved accurately using this method. For a turbulent system, the nonlinear interaction between turbulence and radiation has profound effects and cannot be neglected when developing inverse radiation tools. In the presence of TRI, temperature and concentration can never be measured directly. An inverse radiation model considering how turbulence and radiation interact along the detector's line-of-sight has been developed to deduce time-averaged and root-mean-square (rms) values of temperature and concentrations as well as the turbulent length scale from the time-averaged transmissivity and its rms spectrum for a single turbulent gas as well as a turbulent gas mixture...|$|E
