50|$|The {{addition}} of a ball-and-spring-type detent on the shift sleeve and detents on the <b>shift</b> <b>rail</b> assists the driver in shifting quicker. The detent raises the force required to move the shift lever which prevents excess movement of the shifter by the driver, and reduces the chance of double bump. Tension between the shift sleeve and the <b>shift</b> <b>rail</b> also prevents the sleeve from vibrating while in gear.|$|R
50|$|Design {{features}} of the TR-6070 synchronizers include a combination of double-cone and triple-cone rings, utilizing a hybrid solution on all forward gears. The hybrid rings are a combination of carbon and sintered bronze cones providing higher capacity and shift performance. Linear bearings lower the friction of the <b>shift</b> <b>rail</b> movements, making the shifter feel naturally lighter and more direct.|$|R

30|$|The {{effect of}} the white paper {{implementation}} is most noticeable in the White Paper High scenario where demand for transport nearly doubles from an annual average of 1.52 to 2.87  %. As expected, the <b>shift</b> to <b>rail</b> freight in the Low scenario {{is lower than the}} High scenario, due to the strict conditions imposed within the scenario – i.e. having to meet two control variables (infrastructure and demand). More specifically, a 90 million tonnes modal <b>shift</b> to <b>rail</b> is foreseen in 2030 and a 165 million tonnes shift in 2050, coming mainly from the EU 15 (for example Germany and Italy are responsible for 40  % of the shifted load).|$|R

50|$|Prior to the 1980s, freight and {{passenger}} transport activities were predominantly achieved by rail transport rather than by road. The 1980s and 1990s saw a growing trend toward roads {{as a method of}} transportation and a <b>shift</b> away from <b>rail</b> transport. In 1978, rail transport accounted for 54.4% of the total freight movement in China, while road transport only accounted for 2.8%. By 1997, road transport's share of freight movement had increased to 13.8% while the railway's share decreased to 34.3%. Similarly, road's share of passenger transport increased from 29.9% to 53.3% within the same time period, with railway's share decreasing from 62.7% to 35.4%.

50|$|The {{volume of}} traffic in Germany, {{especially}} goods transportation, is {{at a very high}} level due to its central location in Europe.In the past few decades, much of the freight traffic <b>shifted</b> from <b>rail</b> to road, which led the Federal Government to introduce a motor toll for trucks in 2005.

40|$|AbstractA modal <b>shift</b> to <b>rail</b> {{is crucial}} to {{achieving}} a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, relieving urban congestion and providing increased mobility. In order to successfully meet this growing demand for efficient and green mobility, the railway sector needs to progress in terms of quality of service, energy and life cycle costs, interoperability, capacity, noise reduction and must also further develop its carbon emission advantages. Roll 2 Rail is a research project which aims to develop key technologies that will overcome hurdles to innovation in rolling stock development and forms part of a longer term strategy towards revolutionising the rolling stock of today. The results {{will contribute to the}} increase of operational reliability and to the reduction of the life cycle costs. This project started in May 2015 and it is supported by the Horizon 2020 programme of the European Commission (www. roll 2 rail. eu). Roll 2 Rail is one of the so called “lighthouse projects” of the <b>Shift</b> 2 <b>Rail</b> Joint Undertaking and will contribute to Innovation Programme 1. At the end of the project the outcomes will be incorporated into real vehicles or relevant environments within the Technical Demonstrators of <b>Shift</b> 2 <b>Rail.</b> In particular, Roll 2 Rail focuses on technological innovations in different subsystems of the vehicles which, individually, each and all together, contribute to achieve the desired impact at vehicle and whole railway system level on capacity, reliability, efficiency, comfort and life cycle costs. The project expects innovations in 8 different areas such as traction and power electronics, train communications, car bodyshell, running gear technologies, brakes, train interiors, noise and vibration and energy performance. Moreover, this project will deliver a set of technical recommendations and proposals of standardisation. Details on the concept, activities to be performed and first results are presented in this paper...|$|R

40|$|New {{data from}} {{fourteen}} European countries on passenger and freight rail transport reveal the significant role of fares, subsidies and, especially, quality variables {{in explaining the}} large variation in the demand for rail across Europe.

40|$|AbstractForecasts {{indicate}} {{that it is not}} possible to reduce total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transport to fulfil the target of two degrees global warming with technology means alone. It is possible to reduce GHG-emissions for all modes but still rail will be the most efficient mode by 2050. Rail has a modest market share in the EU in comparison with ‘best practice’ rail systems in the world. There is a big potential if the rail system is developed with new high speed rail and freight corridors as well as an upgraded conventional network and intermodal systems. This paper presents an estimation of the effects of a partial mode <b>shift</b> to <b>rail</b> transport applying world's ‘best practice’ by the year 2050. It is shown that such a mode <b>shift</b> to <b>rail</b> can reduce EU transport GHG emissions over land by about 20 %, compared with a baseline scenario. In combination with lowcarbon electricity production a reduction of about 30 % may be achieved. A developed rail system can thus substantially contribute to the EU target of reducing GHG emissions in the transport sector by 60 % below 1990 levels. To enable such a mode shift and to manage the demand for capacity, there is a need ofinvestments. This will also maintain and increase mobility for passengers and freight transport...|$|R
50|$|In 1967 wagonload freight {{produced}} {{two thirds of}} BR's freight revenue. Further reductions of the systems were made, 4000 miles of line were closed between 1965 and 1973. By 1972 the number of marshalling yards {{had been reduced to}} 124 from over 600 a decade earlier. These cuts had a limited effect of freight traffic, reducing freight by only 13%. Introduction of unit train type merry-go-round services and Freightliner intermodal services introduced from the 1960s onwards also <b>shifted</b> <b>rail</b> freight transport away from the wagonload workings, but could not total replace it; the economic future of wagonload services remained uncertain in the 1970s, despite the introduction of a new airbraked higher speed service named Speedlink (trialled in 1972, formally introduced in 1977). In 1976 wagonload freight was still making a loss of £30 million pa. The loss making Speedlink operations cease in 1991. In 1992 wagonload traffic carried by BR in the UK was 15.2million tonnes, approximately 10% of freight traffic. Some residual wagonload operations including international freight work continued to be operated by Railfreight Distribution (RfD), in particular as part of its Connectrail service; RfD was also unprofitable, and when privatised in 1997 the acquirer, EWS received significant subsidies (over £200 million over 8 years). Minor wagonload services were operated in the post privatisation period, including EWS's 'Enterprise' service, which carried 3 million tonnes of freight in 1999.|$|R
