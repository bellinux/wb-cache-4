5|$|For 1903, the Active Squadron was {{on active}} service for seven months, {{with the rest}} of the year spent with reduced crews. In 190405, <b>Sardegna</b> and her sisters were in service with the Active Squadron, which was kept in service for nine months of the year, with three months in reduced commission. The {{following}} year, the ships were transferred to the Reserve Squadron, along with the three s and the ironclad , three cruisers, and sixteen torpedo boats. This squadron only entered active service for two months of the year for training maneuvers, and the rest of the year was spent with reduced crews. <b>Sardegna</b> was still in the Reserve Squadron in 1908, along with her two sisters and the two s. By this time, the Reserve Squadron was kept in service for seven months of the year.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sardegna</b> {{spent the}} first decade of her career in the Active Squadron of the Italian fleet. Thereafter, she was {{transferred}} to the Reserve Squadron, and by 1911, she was part of the Training Division. She took part in the Italo-Turkish War of 191112, where she escorted convoys to North Africa and supported Italian forces ashore by bombarding Ottoman troops. During World War I, <b>Sardegna</b> served as the flagship of the naval forces defending Venice against a possible attack from the Austro-Hungarian Navy, which did not materialize. After the city became threatened following the Battle of Caporetto in November 1917, the ship was withdrawn to Brindisi and later Taranto, where she continued to serve as a guard ship. She took part in Allied operations in Turkey in 191922, and after returning to Italy in 1923, she was broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|In May 1912, the Training Division {{patrolled the}} coast, but saw no action. The {{following}} month, <b>Sardegna</b> and her sisters, along with six torpedo boats, escorted a convoy carrying an infantry brigade to Buscheifa, {{one of the}} last ports in Libya still under Ottoman control. The Italian force arrived off the town on 14 June and made a landing; after taking the city, the Italian forces then moved on to Misrata. <b>Sardegna</b> {{and the rest of the}} ships continued supporting the advance until the Italians had secured the city on 20 July. The Training Division then returned to Italy, where they joined the escort for another convoy on 3 August, this time to Zuara, the last port in Ottoman hands. The ships covered the landing two miles east of Zuara two days later, which was joined by supporting attacks from the west and south. With the capture of the city, Italy now controlled the entire Libyan coast. On 14 October the Ottomans agreed to sign a peace treaty to end the war.|$|E

5|$|From {{the onset}} of Italian {{participation}} in the war, Ammiraglio di Saint Bon {{was used as a}} harbor defense ship in Venice, along with her sister and the old battleship <b>Sardegna,</b> as well as two cruisers and several smaller craft. After April 1916, Ammiraglio di Saint Bon was used as a floating anti-aircraft battery to defend Venice. She continued in this role {{until the end of the}} war in November 1918. The ship remained in the Italian Navy's inventory for only a short time after the end of the war; she was stricken from the naval register on 18 June 1920 and subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|The Re Umberto {{class were}} {{a group of}} three ironclad battleships built for the Italian Navy in the 1880s and 1890s. The ships, , and were built as the {{culmination}} of a major naval expansion program begun in the 1870s following Italy's defeat at the Battle of Lissa in 1866. The Re Umbertos incorporated several innovations over previous Italian designs, including a more efficient arrangement of the main battery, installation of wireless telegraphs, and in <b>Sardegna,</b> the first use of triple-expansion steam engines in an Italian capital ship. Designed by Benedetto Brin, they retained the very thin armor protection and high top speeds of his earlier designs.|$|E
5|$|All three ships {{served in}} the Active Squadron for {{the first decade of}} their careers, which proved to be uneventful. They were {{transferred}} to the Reserve Squadron in 1905, and by the outbreak of the Italo-Turkish War in 1911, they were serving as training ships. They provided fire support to Italian troops fighting in Libya during the conflict and took part in the seizure of several Ottoman ports, including Tripoli. During World War I, <b>Sardegna</b> was used as a guard ship in Venice, while Re Umberto served as a floating battery in Brindisi and Sicilia was reduced to a depot ship. All three ships survived the war and were broken up for scrap in the early 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Italy had {{declared}} neutrality {{at the start}} of World War I, but by July 1915, the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the Central Powers. Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that the threat from Austro-Hungarian submarines and naval mines in the narrow waters of the Adriatic was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. Instead, Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the main fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations. For their part, the Austro-Hungarians adopted a similar strategy, as they too were unwilling to risk the heavy units of their fleet. She was the flagship for the Northern Adriatic Naval Forces after Italy entered the war. The Northern Adriatic Naval Forces also included the two old Ammiraglio di Saint Bon-class battleships, two cruisers, and several smaller craft. The ships were tasked with defending Venice from Austro-Hungarian attacks; this service lasted until 15 November 1917. Since neither the Italians or Austro-Hungarians were willing to risk the main units of their fleets, <b>Sardegna</b> had an uneventful career during the war.|$|E

25|$|At the Rally d'Italia <b>Sardegna,</b> Loeb had a {{puncture}} {{after going}} {{off the road}} and dropped from third to fourth. Although he passed Petter Solberg for the final podium spot, he still finished fourth due to a time penalty for a safety rule violation; co-driver Daniel Elena had unfastened his safety belts before the crew stopped the car for a tyre change. At the Acropolis Rally, Loeb crashed out from third place. On Rally Poland's return to the WRC, Loeb had another crash but he continued in the event under superally rules.

25|$|Rolfe took an {{interest}} in photography throughout his life, but never achieved any more than basic competence. While he began to experiment with photography when he was a schoolmaster, it was his time in Rome in 1889–90 that introduced him to the work of the 'Arcadian' photographers Wilhelm von Gloeden and Guglielmo Plüschow. His seminary, the Scots College, was quite close to Plüschow's studio in via <b>Sardegna,</b> just off the via Veneto, and when Rolfe was expelled from the College and came under the benevolent patronage of the Duchess Sforza Cesarini, he began his own photographic efforts in imitation of von Gloeden and Plüschow. His models were the local ragazzi from the streets of Genzano di Roma, a town dominated by the Duchess's palazzo. These youths were later to become the principal characters in Rolfe's Toto stories, published first in The Yellow Book in 1895–96 and later collected in Stories Toto Told Me in 1898 and In His Own Image in 1901.|$|E

By the morning of the 4th, the ships' gunfire had silenced the guns in the fort, allowing landing forces to go ashore and capture the city. The ships of the Training Division thereafter alternated between Tripoli and Khoms to support the Italian garrisons in the two cities; this included repulsing a major Ottoman attack on Tripoli over 2326 October, where <b>Sardegna</b> and Sicilia supported the Italian left flank against concerted Ottoman assaults. During this engagement, <b>Sardegna</b> used a spotter aircraft to help direct the fire of her guns, the first time aircraft had been used in that role.
