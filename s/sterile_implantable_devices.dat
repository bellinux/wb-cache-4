40|$|Abstract — The {{algorithm}} of {{epileptic seizure}} {{is at the}} core of any <b>implantable</b> <b>device</b> aimed to treat the symptoms of this disorder. A training free (on line) epileptic seizure detection algorithm for <b>implantable</b> <b>device</b> utilizing Autoregressive (AR) model parameters is developed and studied. Pre-recorded (off line) epileptic seizure data are used to estimate the internal parameters of an AR model prior and following the seizure Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is used for reducing the dimension of the problem while allowing only the salient features representing the seizure onset to be saved into the <b>implantable</b> <b>device.</b> The <b>implantable</b> <b>device</b> estimates the AR model parameter in real time and compares the saved features of seizure onset with feature from the incoming signals using cosine similarity. In order to guarantee an efficient on line signal processing, Weighted Least Square Estimation (WLSE) model is utilized. Simulation result shows that the proposed method has average 96. 6 % detection accuracy and 1. 2 ms latency for the data sets under study.

40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} is a multidisciplinary field that develops biological substitutes to restore, maintain, or improve damaged tissues. Biodegradable tissue engineering applications are often complex composite structures that combine a biodegradable medical device with biological factors. Materials used in tissue engineering applications are sensitive and cannot withstand high temperatures, humidity, irradiation, and/or chemicals. These qualities pose special challenges to sterilization process and packaging design. The heavy regulations {{that apply to}} tissue engineering products affect the packaging solution from choosing the sterilization method to the design and testing of the final package. This thesis is a literature review. The scope of this thesis was to examine suitable packaging solutions for biodegradable tissue engineering products. For background, the current relevant legislation and regulations in the European Union and in the United States were reviewed, and different aspects of packaging of medical devices were discussed. Also several sterilization methods, as well as aseptic processing were reviewed, and multiple packaging solutions that are or could be suitable for <b>sterile</b> biodegradable <b>implantable</b> medical <b>devices</b> were presented. Due to the diverse nature of biodegradable tissue engineering products, {{it is impossible to}} suggest one universal packaging solution. Some general guidelines, however, can be suggested based on the common features of biodegradable tissue engineering products, usability studies, and sustainability considerations. An ideal packaging would be a double sterile barrier system consisting of a rigid tray in a flexible, clear pouch that would also serve as a moisture barrier. All the packaging components should be easy to open quickly in an operating room environment. The outer carton should be as small as possible, while still providing sufficient protection and information. The final materials for the packaging should be chosen based on whether the product will be sterilized in the final package or whether it will be aseptically processed...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{a variety}} of {{biomaterial}} <b>implantable</b> <b>devices</b> has been developed. Of particular significance to pharmaceutical sciences is the progress made {{on the development of}} drug/implantable device combination products. However, the clinical application of these devices is still a critical issue due to the host response, which results from both the tissue trauma during implantation and the presence of the device in the body. Accordingly, the in vivo functionality and durability of any <b>implantable</b> <b>device</b> can be compromised by the body response to the foreign material. Numerous strategies to overcome negative body reactions have been reported.

40|$|Recently, <b>implantable</b> <b>devices</b> {{have become}} {{widely used in}} neural {{prostheses}} because they eliminate endemic drawbacks of conventional percutaneous neural interface systems. However, there are still several issues to be considered: low-efficiency wireless power transmission; wireless data communication over restricted operating distance with high power consumption; and limited functionality, working either as a neural signal recorder or as a stimulator. To overcome these issues, we suggest a novel implantable wireless neural interface system for simultaneous neural signal recording and stimulation using a single cuff electrode. By using widely available commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components, an easily reconfigurable implantable wireless neural interface system was implemented into one compact module. The <b>implantable</b> <b>device</b> includes a wireless power consortium (WPC) -compliant power transmission circuit, a medical implant communication service (MICS) -band-based radio link and a cuff-electrode path controller for simultaneous neural signal recording and stimulation. During in vivo experiments with rabbit models, the <b>implantable</b> <b>device</b> successfully recorded and stimulated the tibial and peroneal nerves while communicating with the external device.

40|$|With {{the cost}} of {{healthcare}} in the U.

The two most promising ways of achieving this are through developments in <b>implantable</b> <b>devices</b> for monitoring and treating patients outside of clinical settings and through better point-of-care diagnostics tools. The {{first part of this}} dissertation focuses on the development of a potentially <b>implantable</b> autonomous <b>device</b> for the prevention of late-phase hemorrhagic shock (HS), {{the leading cause of death}} for people with traumatic injuries. We demonstrate that such a device can continuously monitor vasopressin levels, an indicator of late-phase HS, and release vasopressin automatically when levels drop below a certain threshold in order to help stabilize the situation. We also discuss the possibility of using a nonenzymatic glucose fuel cell unit, instead of a lithium battery, in order to increase the <b>implantable</b> <b>device's</b> lifetime. Novel power sources are important in the development of low-power long-term <b>implantable</b> <b>devices,</b> and we propose several non-enzymatic fuel cells that can be used as coating layers on current <b>implantable</b> <b>devices</b> or as stand-alone power sources. We show that such glucose fuel cell can produce 16 [MICRO SIGN]W cm- 3 of power and can be integrated in <b>implantable</b> <b>devices</b> such as the one for preventing late-phase HS.
