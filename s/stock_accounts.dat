However, the first formal market, the Association of Stockbrokers in Hong Kong, was not established until 1891. The Association was renamed the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1914.A second exchange, the Hong Kong Stockbrokers' Association was incorporated in 1921. The two exchanges merged to form the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1947 and re-establish the stock market after the Second World War.Rapid growth of the Hong Kong economy led to the establishment of three other exchanges - the Far East Exchange in 1969; the Kam Ngan Stock Exchange in 1971; and the Kowloon Stock Exchange in 1972.Pressure to strengthen market regulation and to unify the four exchanges led to the incorporation of SEHK, the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited in 1980. The four exchanges ceased business on 27 March 1986 and the new exchange commenced trading through a computer-assisted system on 2 April 1986. Prior to the completion of the merger with HKFE in March 2000, the unified stock exchange had 570 participant organisations.Hong Kong Securities Clearing Company Limited was incorporated in 1989. It created CCASS, the central clearing and settlement system, which started operating in 1992 and became the central counterparty for all CCASS participants.The clearing operation is based on the immobilisation of share certificates in a central depository.

5000|$|In {{the context}} of {{perpetual}} inventory, backflushing is automatic accounting of material consumed for production, {{at the time of}} confirmation of the production, e.g. when a 4-wheeler automobile is rolled out from assembly line, 4 wheels and tires are deemed to be consumed and issued to production order automatically by way of back flushing by the system. Typically the assembly line has its own limited stock of materials as work in process. This stock is replenished by transferring materials from a warehouse (store) into the assembly lines own designated location, e.g. a supermarket. At goods receipt the consumed materials are posted automatically from the location designated to the issuing production line. In other words, back flushing refers only to materials which are already withdrawn from the inventory of the warehouse (store) and were delivered to the shop floor. Parts are issued from stores to Work-In-Process inventory, but not based on a job order or for a specific production order. They are issued in quantities estimated to cover requirements of individual work centers and production lines. The issuing may be used to cover a period of time or to fill a fixed—size container. But unlike the traditional approach, also known as [...] "preproduction issuing" [...] where the costs are assigned to the product order at the withdrawal of materials from the stores and after completion of production any excess material is given back to the stores, backflushing delays that until the goods receipt of the finished product or assembly is issued. The remaining quantity of unused material left on the shops is still held in the system as floor stock and so material will not be ordered incorrectly through the Manufacturing resource planning (MRP). By eliminating work-in-process accounts, backflush costing simplifies the accounting process. However, this simplification and other deviations from traditional costing systems mean that backflush costing may not always conform to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Another drawback of this system is the lack of a sequential audit trail. The main advantage of postproduction issuing, not necessarily of backflushing, {{is that there is no}} need to update the store balances of inventory at the withdrawal of the materials from stores and recording the excess material through reverse posting (storno). This is especially useful in series or mass production where it is no need to give back excess material to the stores because it is used for the next production order. Even if excess material is given back to stores it does not involve any update to the inventory balance in the financial accounting (<b>stock</b> <b>accounts).</b> It involves only a stock transfer in the inventory management or warehouse management. Only the materials reported as consumed through the method of backflushing or by the MES imply an update to the inventory balance: ...|$|E

The concepts of gross and net linkages are introduced and the analysis is extended to both current (flow) and capital (<b>stock)</b> <b>accounts.</b> On the gross linkage criterion, only a handful of sectors emerge as key sectors with three or more linkages. These sectors are from within the manufacturing and services categories. This is also the case with sectors having two strong linkages. Agricultural sectors do not feature at all. A transition from gross to net linkages changes the rankings quite significantly. Most agricultural sectors show two strong linkages in the flow account. The findings suggest that Bangladeshi export sector, is typically undiversified in that it relies heavily on agriculture and related industries, with jute and jute textiles accounting for over 70 percent of net export earnings.

40|$|The {{tentative}} decisions under International Accounting Standards Reporting Comprehensive Income (Performance Reporting) (IAS Plus 2004 c) require {{several items}} that are noncore business to be included as comprehensive income. Using data from Australian firms we replicate the IAS adjustments and use linear and non-linear association regressions to test value relevance of these components. Essentially, our study provides a market test of the Maines and McDaniel (2000) hypothesis that the inclusion of noncore operations in comprehensive income may introduce extraneous noise for investors as a single class. We find evidence that the incorporation of revaluations of non-current operating assets and the non-reporting of extraordinary items in comprehensive income significantly reduces value relevance, with net income from ordinary operations the dominant valuation metric.

40|$|The energy {{consumption}} in the existing residential building <b>stock</b> <b>accounts</b> for about 40 % of the total {{energy consumption}} in the built environment. Different types of energy performance indicators to assess the energy consumption of buildings were and still are internationally under development. In this paper we compare the methodologies and accuracies of three Dutch energy performance indicators by applying them to eight houses. This application shows that the actual domestic energy use is linearly correlated with the estimated energy consumption given by the energy performance indicators, but 7 - 25 % lower. Based on the energy performance indicators and actual energy use, we offer a methodology to incorporate additional revenues within the financial analysis of energy saving techniques. These revenues {{are related to the}} value of the dwelling in which the techniques are installed. We use the same houses to analyse the financial returns on energy saving investments. By assigning the value increase of real estate to two popular specific energy saving techniques, namely wall and roof insulation, it is found that the payback period could be 40 - 50 % shorter than when it is solely based on investment costs and energy prices. © 2009 Elsevier B.

40|$|Presently the UK {{social housing}} <b>stock</b> <b>accounts</b> for {{approximately}} 20 % {{of the total}} UK housing with maintenance costs {{in the region of}} £ 1. 25 billion per annum. In terms of its impact on the environment, housing is responsible for approximately 27 % of the UK’s CO 2 emissions. However as only 0. 8 % of housing is replaced each year and, given increased demand, by 2050 approximately 70 % of the housing stock will comprise of that which currently exists. Thus if the housing stock is to address the social, environmental and economic aspects of sustainability, the housing industry will have to work largely with that which exists today. Through a major questionnaire survey of UK social housing providers, our research, supported by in-depth interviews confirms that the current approach to social housing maintenance does not fully address the social, environmental and economic aspects of sustainability and suggests that a new maintenance model is needed which is based on the performance of a house in-use rather than on its physical condition. This will require maintenance managers moving away from the use of a (predominantly) single, subjective criteria model to a multi-criteria hierarchical model which incorporates a much broader understanding of performance than just its physical condition. This paper will report on the development of a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) which will support this new model by providing a mechanism which can quantify and measure social, environmental and economic criteria to help organisations define progress towards their strategic sustainability goals...|$|E
