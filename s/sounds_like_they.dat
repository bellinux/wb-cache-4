500|$|Kurt and Blaine's duet on [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside" [...] {{received}} many more reviews {{than the other}} songs, and the greatest praise. Wieselman called it his [...] "far and away favorite" [...] song of the episode. Stack declared it the [...] "complete and total highlight of the episode {{and one of the}} best moments of the second season". He gave it an [...] "A+". Hankinson said it was the show's [...] "best musical number", and described it as [...] "well-performed, sweet and wonderfully choreographed"; he added: [...] "It was bold, without being gimmicky". The Atlantic Meghan Brown and Patrick Burns were both enthusiastic: Brown said [...] "Kurt's sweetly sexy duet with Blaine was near-perfect" [...] and [...] "the vocals and choreography gave Chris Colfer and Darren Criss a real chance to shine", while Burns called it [...] "adorable". Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone wrote that it was [...] "full of sweet harmonies and has an ideal undercurrent of romantic tension", though Harper [...] "wasn't feeling any chemistry between them"; she felt the performance was [...] "a little overacted", but noted that [...] "their voices seem to like each other". Benigno was also less enthusiastic; he gave the song a [...] "B−" [...] and felt there was [...] "something missing" [...] from the rendition: [...] "these two could have sang this number in their sleep and it kind of <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> did".|$|E
50|$|Foley artists {{review the}} film as it runs {{to figure out what}} <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> need to achieve the desired sound and results. Once they gather the {{material}} and prepare for use, they practice the sounds. When they accomplish the desired sound, they watch the film and add in the sound effects at the same time. This is similar to the way actors re-record dialogue, lip-syncing to the video or film image.|$|E
5000|$|White Light has {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. Neil Yeung of AllMusic rated 4/5 stars for the album, stating that [...] "this collection <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> picked up immediately after their last album {{and not a}} return to the scene after a decade." [...] Adrian Thrills from the Daily Mail gave the album 3/5 stars, saying that [...] "despite its more adult themes, White Light finds The Corrs reclaiming a winning sound that {{is still one of the}} most distinctive in pop." ...|$|E

50|$|Smoothing (estimation) and {{smoothing}} (convolution) {{can mean}} totally different, but <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are apparently similar. The concepts are different {{and are used}} in almost different historical contexts. The requirements are very different.|$|R
5000|$|According {{to music}} critics, [...] "What makes Mitochondrion stand out is {{their ability to}} bring order to chaos. ... It is a trait they share with Deathspell Omega, who craft a dizzying amount of sounds and {{influences}} into something palpably evil and eminently listenable. When most other bands try this, it <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are toying with forces they do not understand." [...] The musicianship on Parasignosis has been defined by Decibel magazine as a [...] "dense, not-so-easily-digestible labyrinth of frightening mindfuckery." [...] While Parasignosis itself was praised as a [...] "mind-blowing, highly individual album." ...|$|E
5000|$|In response, Sheriff Stanek {{issued a}} {{statement}} explaining that his office responded to the request from North Dakota to maintain [...] "the public's safety, preserve the peace, and protect the constitutional rights of protesters" [...] and that the deployment was a routine mutual aid agreement between law enforcement agencies. Minnesota deputies were released from their duties in Morton County on October 31 after the state fulfilled its part of the EMAC agreement. Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton stated {{in an interview that}} the deployment was a routine mutual aid response, and that [...] "It <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> conducted themselves very professionally." ...|$|E
50|$|Around 1991, Connelly saw fit {{to take a}} {{break from}} Nuclear Assault and release a low profile solo record under the name John Connelly Theory. Although Connelly {{surrounded}} himself with three different musicians, the tendency to sound a bit like his main band was unavoidable, particularly since he has one of those singing voices that is quite unmistakable. However, the differences between his solo project and Nuclear Assault was mostly found in the more rock oriented song structures, timid adventurism (the band <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> want to really go into left field but never make it past the short stop), and occasional humor. Nuclear Assault would split up in 1993, John released his solo project called John Connelly's Theory.|$|E
5000|$|William Ruhlmann {{wrote on}} Allmusic, [...] "Trichromes guitarist Ralph Woodson and such guests as Pete Sears and Neal Schon do fine by lyrics, {{creating}} songs that <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> could have {{fit into the}} Dead's repertoire. And the band's jamming style is also reminiscent of the Dead...." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "there is a {{contemporary}} R sound" [...] to the album [...] "that wouldn't {{be out of}} place on secular radio" [...] and noted that [...] "The Movement" [...] "has a hip-hop vibe, while glossy ballads like [...] "The Way of Love" [...] <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> could be Destiny's Child slow jams".|$|R

5000|$|Writing for New Release Tuesday, Caitlin Lassiter exclaims [...] "Before There Was {{is a huge}} {{step for}} Bellarive... {{certainly}} the most exciting and promising worship album we've seen so far this year, and {{is sure to be}} categorized {{as one of the best}} of all time." [...] On behalf of Jesus Freak Hideout, Roger Gelwicks portrays that [...] "A rich look at the gospel's power, Before There Was is a distinct highlight for this summer's playlist." [...] Mark Rice derides that [...] "It is a fairly solid worship album with several stunning moments, but it simply <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are trying to satisfy a bit too large of an audience than they are meant to." ...|$|E
5000|$|Reel Big Fishs live {{album was}} {{released}} only 3 {{months prior to}} Greatest Hit...and More and the band has said that Jive Records only released this CD to try to detract sales from their live album. It is {{not supported by the}} band themselves. Lead Singer Aaron Barrett urged fans not to buy it stating in part [...] "To my absolute horror i realized that they did a really awful re-mastering job and made all the music sound like CRAP!! it sounds like somebody went in and cranked up the low end and now the bass and kick drum are obnoxiously loud ... Also, it <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> put a ton of compression on everything and now there are no dynamics!" ...|$|E
5000|$|... Prime Minister Stefan Löfven {{said that}} Sweden will respect the {{decision}} of British citizens even though {{it will be hard}} for them. However, he added that this was a [...] "wake-up call" [...] for the EU and that it must show it can respond to people's expectations. He also called for unity and said negatiotions with the UK should be allowed to take time and {{that it is important to}} maintain good relations with the UK. A few days later, he said [...] "Boris Johnson put forward a vision that the UK shall have free access to the EU, but be able to regulate immigration themselves. <b>Sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> want the rights, but no obligations. This will not happen. Leaving the union will make a difference.|$|E
5000|$|The video, {{in which}} a modern-day Blunt strolls among '70s street scenes, {{reflects}} the song's nostalgic tone. [...] "The '70s <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> were a time of excess and great flamboyance," [...] he says, [...] "but a sense of fun as well." [...] The video was shot in Warsaw, Poland [...]|$|R
50|$|The word Space became synonymous as a Buzzword.Due to the {{ambiguity}} involved the term became favoured by peddlers of Snake oil. A peddler {{could use the}} term 'Space' and <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> were describing facts. In reality they were describing attributes so general {{that they would have}} matched any group of companies.|$|R
5000|$|Neil King, {{writing for}} FATEA magazine, said: [...] "The {{dominating}} sound across Transistor Corazón {{is that of}} the torch ballad and Greeners confident, emotion laden, vocal ensures that the songs <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> could flare at any moment giving the album an inherent tension that she tries to resolve with the lyric." ...|$|R
5000|$|Fraser McAlpine of the BBC {{gave the}} single a {{four out of}} five star rating, saying:Essentially there are two very good {{elements}} in play here: the Yazoo sample, and the chorus. Conveniently these two do not overlap, but one or the other is in play at pretty much any time. However, the sample is probably relied upon too heavily and once you realise that, the verses sound rather flimsy. The chorus, however, bears repeated listens. It's infectious and melodically strong, and mature ... this is an impressive debut - The Saturdays have gone with the trick of releasing a song that doesn't sound like a first single, but <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> have in fact been doing this sort of thing for years and aren't even considering that this might not be a hit.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his review}} for Allmusic, Thom Jurek notes that [...] "Guitar in the Space Age! is a joyous recording. Far from an {{exercise}} in mere nostalgia, it reveals new reasons as to why these tunes are eternal. Frisell and his collaborators understood {{exactly what they were}} going for, and it <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> had a hell of a great time getting there". The Guardians John Fordham observed [...] "This is an old-school electric guitar fan’s album, played by one of the most creative guitar fans in the world". PopMatters Associate Music Editor John Garratt was less enthusiastic and said [...] "Guitar in the Space Age! is professionally executed place holding. I’m not saying {{you have to be a}} baby boomer to enjoy it, but you probably need to be one in order to rank it as one of Frisell’s top five recordings" ...|$|E
5000|$|Ally Carnwath of The Observer {{gave the}} album 2 stars out of 5, and felt [...] "That {{for all their}} stadium uplift and notionally anthemic choruses, they never deliver a hook or melodic sucker punch that really floors you." [...] Lauren Murphy of The Irish Times gave a similar review, saying [...] "Kodaline are a bit drab...It <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are more focused on ticking boxes in order to appeal to their target audience, than on blazing their own trail by {{attempting}} something original." [...] Bevis Man from DIY gave a negative review, saying [...] "Let’s be frank here, what this band needs is a punch {{in the face and}} to grow some balls. It’s hard not to imagine the band, all still in their 20s, writing the album wistfully looking out of a window and feeling incredibly sorry for themselves." [...] Q Magazine were highly critical of the album, calling it [...] "Entirely meritless", and awarded 1 star out of 5.|$|E
5000|$|In 1973, {{soon after}} the band, at the time unnamed, had moved into the large {{farmhouse}} in Gaithersburg, Maryland, a friend arrived with a tray of blueberry muffins as a housewarming gift and shouted [...] "The muffins are here!" [...] <b>Sounding</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> were being introduced, the band adopted the name [...] "The Muffins".|$|R
5000|$|The tunes — {{despite being}} originals {{written in the}} last two years — <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> could be early-century hymns, or covers of protofolk tunes gleaned from old Smithsonian field {{recording}} compilations. Mountain Man's sound would have the listener assuming its members are old-timey Appalachian maidens, rather than coeds touring in a Prius. Jessica Hopper, Chicago Tribune, 2010 ...|$|R
40|$|Why do guitars <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> do, {{and how do}} you {{set about}} making one? These are central {{questions}} addressed by Richard French in this attractive new book.

5000|$|Days Go By {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 51 based on 13 reviews Allmusic reviewer Gregory Heaney gave the album two-and-a-half out of 5 stars, stating {{that it is}} [...] "more for fans who have been with the band for a while than those just tuning in, and while die-hard Offspring followers {{will be able to}} see the shift in the band's sound as part of a logical progression, new listeners would be better served by checking out some of their earlier, more urgent work." [...] Brazilian website Whiplash.net made a very favorable review, giving the album a score 8 out of 10 and noting that: [...] "The album is not flawless, but the guitars are back, there are some [...] "whooas" [...] and that <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are returning to a long lost path." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2013 Reuters {{published}} a {{report about the}} DEA's Special Operations Division (SOD) stating that it conceals where an investigative trail about a suspect truly originates from and creates a parallel set of evidence given to prosecutors, judges, and defense lawyers. This DEA program mainly affects common criminals such as drug dealers. The concealment of evidence means the defendant is unaware how his or her investigation began and {{will be unable to}} request a review possible sources of exculpatory evidence. Exculpatory evidence may include biased witnesses, mistakes, or entrapment. Nancy Gertner, a former federal judge who had served from 1994 to 2011 and a Harvard Law School professor, stated that [...] "It is one thing to create special rules for national security. Ordinary crime is entirely different. It <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are phonying up investigations." [...] Andrew O'Hehir of Salon wrote that [...] "It’s the first clear evidence that the “special rules” and disregard for constitutional law that have characterized the hunt for so-called terrorists have crept into the domestic criminal justice system on a significant scale." ...|$|E
5000|$|Reviews for {{the album}} were mixed, both from critics and fans {{saying that it}} was [...] "premature". According to review {{aggregator}} Metacritic, the album has received mixed or average reviews, scoring 56 out of 100 points based on 11 reviews. Allmusic named [...] "overthinking and over-production" [...] as the album's main flaws, and noted that the group's combination of [...] "teen pop that skews adult in its sound and form" [...] seemed effortless on their previous album, A Little Bit Longer, but felt that on Lines the [...] "seams are showing." [...] Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune claimed, [...] "The rush to maturity is, well, premature," [...] and added that [...] "the strings and horns ... only bog things down." [...] Entertainment Weekly criticized [...] "Don't Charge Me for the Crime," [...] calling it [...] "the sonic equivalent of being held at gunpoint by a baby rabbit," [...] but praised [...] "Black Keys" [...] as being the most honest track, adding that [...] "its quiet brushstrokes of teenage despair easily transcend Lines misdemeanor mutinies." [...] The New York Daily News criticized [...] "World War III," [...] saying, [...] "it <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> just pulled a collective hernia." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{music on}} Welcome to the New has been {{described}} as jazz in parts, to having a rock and dance music flair of the 1970s and 80s, and <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> have been influenced by The Black Keys. This album features some rhythm and blues, urban contemporary gospel, Christian country, and Irish folk that was inspired by touring with Rend Collective.|$|R
5000|$|Negative reviews {{came from}} the Village Voice with Julia Wallace saying [...] "it's unfortunate that Colma pays so little {{attention}} to Colma; it {{may as well be}} set anywhere." [...] while Kyle Smith of the New York Post says [...] "The songs <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> were recorded on a toy synthesizer in someone's basement, and neither of the two male leads can sing." ...|$|R
5000|$|One such {{track was}} the Nas single [...] "Got Ur Self a Gun", which used [...] "Woke Up This Morning" [...] - {{the theme song}} from HBO's The Sopranos. Referencing the music Megahertz created around that sample, MTV's Shaheed Reid wrote, [...] "Megahertz molded pianos and strings that <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> could've been played at the {{coronation}} ceremony for an 18th century king." ...|$|R
5000|$|Phil Newall of Louder Than War was favourable, {{saying the}} album is [...] "good", but noted [...] "I’m just not sure its PWEI", feeling that if the record was {{released}} upon completion, it could have sacrificed some of their original audience in favour of a stronger industrial audience in the United States. He said [...] "I do not expect a band to remain within their established groove, and PWEI had already indicated where they were heading but this just <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> were trying too hard, they were understandably keen to crack the lucrative US industrial market, but I would suggest that in their efforts they may well have alienated their core fan base - that said it’s great to hear this album, {{it is full of}} ideas, of invention, it’s an insight into how PWEI may have and deserves to be released." [...] He described [...] "The Demon" [...] as a [...] "personal favourite", stating it [...] "had me thinking I was listening to a Revolting Cocks bootleg, real power house built around a looping bass and minor keys with a skip full of sequenced noise piled on top." ...|$|E
5000|$|Neil Z. Yeung of Allmusic wrote, [...] "Even {{though this}} is their second release as a band, Phases' debut sounds little like JJAMZ. For Life brings the dingy club rock show into the nightclub, with groove and a smile." [...] Dave Medsker of Popdose {{referred}} to [...] "I'm In Love With My Life" [...] as [...] "a catchy song," [...] and said the album was [...] "loaded with songs just as good or better." [...] He said the album's biggest drawback was [...] "that it <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> had maybe two keyboards and one drum machine to make the entire album. When one listens {{to the number of}} keyboard and drum tracks that CHVRCHES dropped on their first two albums, PHASES would have benefited greatly from diversifying the instrumentation. The tunes are strong, but the sameness in sound undermines them towards the end." [...] Michael Smith at Renowned for Sound gave the album 5 out of 5 stars, writing: [...] "It's not often that you see a band completely reinvent themselves and pull it off as flawlessly as PHASES do ... The intelligent little production choices are what make it such a strong album." ...|$|E
5000|$|Icky Thump {{received}} critical acclaim, with {{an overall}} average rating of 80 out of 100 at Metacritic. Barry Nicolson with British magazine NME wrote, [...] "Icky Thump is brilliant, there's no way around that." [...] Commenting on the album's [...] "fuller sound and relaxed flights of fancy," [...] Heather Phares of AllMusic said [...] "Icky Thump is a mature, but far from stodgy" [...] album, and that [...] "it's just great fun to hear the band play." [...] Jody Rosen, writing for Blender, called the album [...] "the sound of a band not stretching out so much as digging in: burrowing deeper into loamy soil they know well." [...] In {{one of the more}} negative reviews, Josh Tyrangiel of Time remarked, [...] "The White Stripes are too weird and talented to be boring, but it <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> might be a little bored." [...] Ultimately giving the album 3.5 out of 5 stars and giving an (A-) on his website, Robert Christgau, with Rolling Stone, summed up the return album this way [...] "Although the new constructions don't entice as consistently as they should, their noise stays with you. And what that noise stands for is itself." [...] He added, [...] "Like his sometime heroes Led Zeppelin, Jack White builds monuments. They're suitable for awestruck visits. But they're no place to settle down." ...|$|E
50|$|Most {{character}} {{names were}} of a mixed Slavic/Germanic nature (e.g. Dragomilov, Zhukovski, Vurklemeyer, Dinkendorvf). Among the exceptions: most Huns <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> were from Brooklyn and generally had only a given name (Oscar da Hun, Bernie da Hun, George da Hun, Alfred da Hun (although he would later adopt the surname Aardvark)), while the Corese were faux-French and the Baratarians were vaguely Spanish and/or Italian.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} magnetophon had {{its share}} of setbacks as well. Namely, the problem of low fidelity found in previous devices had yet to be solved.
