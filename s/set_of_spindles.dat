40|$|It was not {{too long}} ago that {{designers}} were looking to dedicated hardware to solve the "I/O problem". However, despite the claimed improvements of such back-end processors, with few exceptions, they never reached commercial viability. With today's exponential growth in data, there is growing concern that we are once again reaching a "memory wall" and there is talk of intelligent processing by I/O. While the basic I/O performance characteristics are governed by physics, we can adjust how we view, store, and process data so as to be more in consonance with the I/O devices themselves. Key factors are data granularity and achieving synchronous operation. This paper examines the performance issues of non-numeric applications that are primarily I/O bound. By using a two dimensional data model, logical topology of data is physically preserved on disk. This enables the disk to operate more in a synchronous fashion with granular data access. Using several benchmarks, we contrast the performance of the 2 D model with a lineal model and find that improvements are on the order of 10 - 100 X and roughly in proportion to the granularity of the data. By using intelligent controllers, each controlling a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>spindles,</b> a high degree of parallelism can be achieved without the overhead usually associated with parallel architectures...|$|E

In diverse cell types, the metaphase spindle is maintained at characteristic constant length [1 – 3]. Metaphase spindle length is proposed to be regulated by a balance of pushing and pulling forces generated by distinct <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>spindle</b> microtubules (MTs) and their interactions with motors and MT-associated proteins (MAPs). Spindle length is further proposed to be important for chromosome segregation fidelity, as cells with shorter- or longer-than-normal metaphase spindles, generated through deletion or inhibition of individual mitotic motors or MAPs, showed chromosome segregation defects. To test the force-balance model <b>of</b> <b>spindle</b> length control {{and its effect on}} chromosome segregation, we applied fast microfluidic temperature control with live-cell imaging to monitor the effect of deleting or switching off different combinations of antagonistic force contributors in the fission yeast metaphase spindle.

40|$|In {{eukaryotic}} cells, proteins {{known as}} karyopherins function during interphase as nuclear import and export receptors. Importin [beta] and Transportin, two such karyopherins, act to carry proteins with different recognition sites into the interphase nucleus. Once inside the nucleus, these karyopherins exchange their cargoes for RanGTP, which is exclusively nucleoplasmic. Interestingly, Importin [beta] {{has a very}} different role in mitosis. There it acts as a spatial regulator of mitotic events, including spindle assembly. Importin [beta] masks spindle assembly factors everywhere except {{in the vicinity of}} chromatin, where a high concentration of RanGTP exists. Recently, our lab demonstrated that Transportin also regulates mitotic events. However, the mechanism for this was not explored. Firm in the knowledge of Importin [beta]'s regulation of mitotic events, there are two obvious models for Transportin's regulation <b>of</b> <b>spindle</b> assembly. One is that Transportin acts by binding to and titrating RanGTP, thus modulating the release <b>of</b> <b>spindle</b> assembly factors by Importin [beta]. A second is that, like Importin [beta], Transportin functions directly in spindle assembly, itself binding and masking a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>spindle</b> assembly factors. We employed different tools to test these mechanisms : M 9 M, a known inhibitor of Transportin in nuclear import, and TLB, a Transportin mutant with a truncated H 8 loop that is desensitized to Ran-mediated cargo release. We used these molecular tools both in an in vitro extract derived from Xenopus laevis eggs and in an in vivo system, HeLa cells. Our results support the hypothesis that Transportin acts during mitosis, not indirectly through the titration of RanGTP, but directly by regulating spindle assembly factors.

Metaphase spindle length is proposed to be regulated by a balance of pushing and pulling forces generated by distinct <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>spindle</b> microtubules and their interactions with motors and microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs).

From longitudinal sections <b>of</b> the central <b>spindle,</b> the lengths <b>of</b> the whole <b>spindle,</b> half-spindle, and overlap were measured from 80 cells at different mitotic stages. Numerous sources of error may create inaccuracies in these measurements; these problems are discussed. The central spindle at prophase consists predominantly of continuous MTs (pole to pole). Between late prophase and prometaphase, spindle length increases, and the spindle is transformed into two half-spindles (mainly polar MTs) interdigitated to form the overlap. At late anaphase-telophase, the overlap decreases concurrent with spindle elongation. Our interpretation is that the MTs <b>of</b> the central <b>spindle</b> slide past one another at both late prophase and late anaphase. These changes in MT distribution have the effect <b>of</b> elongating the <b>spindle</b> and are not involved in the poleward movement of the chromosomes.

As in MOPDII patients, disruption of pericentrin (Pcnt) in mice caused a number of abnormalities including microcephaly, aberrant hemodynamics analyzed by in utero echocardiography, and cardiovascular anomalies; the latter being associated with mortality, as in the human condition. To identify the mechanisms underlying these defects, we tested for changes in cell and molecular function. All Pcnt(-/-) mouse tissues and cells examined showed spindle misorientation. This mouse phenotype was associated with misdirected ventricular septal growth in the heart, decreased proliferative symmetric divisions in brain neural progenitors, and increased misoriented divisions in fibroblasts; the same phenotype was seen in fibroblasts from three MOPDII individuals. Misoriented spindles were associated with disrupted astral microtubules and near complete loss <b>of</b> a unique <b>set</b> <b>of</b> centrosome proteins from spindle poles (ninein, Cep 215, centriolin).

Importantly, Pcnt disruption had no detectable effect on localization of proteins involved in the cortical polarity pathway (NuMA, p 150 (glued), aPKC).

40|$|SummaryCell size {{is one of}} the {{critical}} parameters controlling the size of intracellular structures. A well-known example is the constant nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio (N/C ratio) [1 – 5]. The length <b>of</b> the metaphase <b>spindle</b> is proportional to cell size, but it has an upper limit during early embryogenesis [6]. During anaphase, the mitotic spindle elongates and delivers the centrosomes and sister chromatids near the centers of the nascent daughter cells. Here, we quantified the relationship between spindle elongation and cell size in the early embryo of Caenorhabditis elegans and propose possible models for cell-size-dependent spindle elongation. Quantitative measurements revealed that the extent and speed <b>of</b> <b>spindle</b> elongation are correlated with cell size throughout early embryogenesis. RNAi knockdown of Gα proteins and their regulators revealed that the spindles failed to fully elongate and that the speed <b>of</b> <b>spindle</b> elongation was almost constant regardless of cell size. Our results suggest that spindle elongation is controlled by two qualitatively distinct mechanisms, i. e., Gα-dependent and -independent modes of elongation. Simulation analyses revealed that the constant-pulling model and the force-generator-limited model reproduced the dynamics of the Gα-independent and Gα-dependent mechanisms, respectively.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focused on}} the experimental validation for chatter stability prediction. An optimum machining was aimed to maximize the material removal rate, whilst maintaining a sufficient stability margin to assure the surface quality. High material removal rate in machining produced self-excited vibration or chatter of the cutting tool and the workpiece. This resulted in a poor surface finish and dimensional accuracy, chipping of the cutter teeth, and also may damage the workpiece as well as machining tool. Frequency response function of a single degree freedom flexural was measured and the cutting stiffness of tools were determined {{in order to be}} used in predicting chatter stability using semi discretization method.

Stable conditions were shown outside the boundary of chatter region. The optimized cutting tool was predicted to suppress chatter. Machining experiment tests showed there were no chatter vibration conditions during machining process until 1. 5 mm depth of cut.

It is shown that spatial motion <b>of</b> <b>spindle</b> stipulates {{the origin of}} gyroscopic moments on rotable components. Negative effect of gyroscopic moments on the rolling bodies of bearing is grounded. For certain, the problem in general lies in development of high-efficiency machine-tools of parallel kinematics with high-frequency <b>of</b> <b>spindle</b> rotation. The aim of research is theoretical determination of loading on the rotable details <b>of</b> <b>spindle</b> knot at its spatial moving and development of measures to offset {{the negative effects of}} the rotational motion <b>of</b> the <b>spindle.</b> Tasks <b>of</b> the research are to put mathematical description of the dynamic loading, to establish the effect of these loads on the rotable details <b>of</b> <b>spindle</b> and to develop suggestions on indemnification of negative effects of gyroscopic moments on the <b>spindle</b> knot <b>of</b> machine-tool of parallel kinematics. It is recommended not to use the <b>spindle</b> <b>of</b> bearings rolling in parallel kinematics machines.
