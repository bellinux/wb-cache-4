25|$|Fibrous silica has a {{structure}} {{similar to that}} of SiS2 with chains of edge-sharing SiO4 tetrahedra. <b>Stishovite,</b> the higher-pressure form, in contrast, has a rutile-like structure where silicon is 6-coordinate. The density of <b>stishovite</b> is 4.287g/cm3, which compares to α-quartz, the densest of the low-pressure forms, which has a density of 2.648g/cm3. The difference in density can be ascribed to the increase in coordination as the six shortest Si-O bond lengths in <b>stishovite</b> (four Si-O bond lengths of 176 pm and two others of 181 pm) are greater than the Si-O bond length (161 pm) in α-quartz.|$|E
25|$|The {{high-pressure}} minerals, seifertite, <b>stishovite,</b> and coesite, though, {{have higher}} densities and indices of refraction than quartz. This is {{probably due to}} the intense compression of the atoms occurring during their formation, resulting in more condensed structure.|$|E
25|$|Microscopic {{pressure}} deformations of minerals. These include fracture {{patterns in}} crystals of quartz and feldspar, and formation of high-pressure {{materials such as}} diamond, derived from graphite and other carbon compounds, or <b>stishovite</b> and coesite, varieties of shocked quartz.|$|E
25|$|Tridymite and {{cristobalite}} are high-temperature polymorphs of SiO2 {{that occur}} in high-silica volcanic rocks. Coesite is a denser polymorph of SiO2 found in some meteorite impact sites and in metamorphic rocks formed at pressures greater than those typical of the Earth's crust. <b>Stishovite</b> is a yet denser and higher-pressure polymorph of SiO2 found in some meteorite impact sites. Lechatelierite is an amorphous silica glass SiO2 which is formed by lightning strikes in quartz sand.|$|E
25|$|SiO2 has {{a number}} of {{distinct}} crystalline forms (polymorphs) in addition to amorphous forms. With the exception of <b>stishovite</b> and fibrous silica, all of the crystalline forms involve tetrahedral SiO4 units linked together by shared vertices in different arrangements. Silicon–oxygen bond lengths vary between the different crystal forms; for example in α-quartz the bond length is 161 pm, whereas in α-tridymite it is in the range 154–171 pm. The Si-O-Si angle also varies between a low value of 140° in α-tridymite, up to 180° in β-tridymite. In α-quartz, the Si-O-Si angle is 144°.|$|E
25|$|Polymorphism {{can extend}} beyond pure {{symmetry}} content. The aluminosilicates are {{a group of}} three minerals – kyanite, andalusite, and sillimanite – which share the chemical formula Al2SiO5. Kyanite is triclinic, while andalusite and sillimanite are both orthorhombic and belong to the dipyramidal point group. These difference arise correspond to how aluminium is coordinated within the crystal structure. In all minerals, one aluminium ion is always in six-fold coordination by oxygen; the silicon, as a general rule is in four-fold coordination in all minerals; an exception is a case like <b>stishovite</b> (SiO2, an ultra-high pressure quartz polymorph with rutile structure). In kyanite, the second aluminium is in six-fold coordination; its chemical formula can be expressed as AlAlSiO5, to reflect its crystal structure. Andalusite has the second aluminium in five-fold coordination (AlAlSiO5) and sillimanite has it in four-fold coordination (AlAlSiO5).|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} 1960 that later {{research}} by Eugene Merle Shoemaker confirmed Barringer's hypothesis. The key discovery was the presence in the crater of the minerals coesite and <b>stishovite,</b> rare forms of silica found only where quartz-bearing rocks have been severely shocked by an instantaneous overpressure. It cannot be created by volcanic action; the only known mechanisms of creating it is naturally through an impact event, or artificially through a nuclear explosion. Shoemaker was uniquely aware of this {{as he had been}} researching the shocked mineral formations that were formed after the nuclear detonation testing in the Nevada desert. Therefore, when similar minerals were seen at the Barringer Crater, he was certain that a similar kind of sudden shock compression was responsible for the crater, which effectively ruled out the then more mainstream view that the crater {{was the result of a}} comparatively less sudden volcanic eruption.|$|E
25|$|Silicon dioxide (SiO2), {{also known}} as silica, {{is one of the}} most well-studied compounds, second only to water. Twelve {{different}} crystal modifications of silica are known, the most common being α-quartz, a major constituent of many rocks such as granite and sandstone. It is also known to occur pure as rock crystal; impure forms are known as rose quartz, smoky quartz, morion, amethyst, and citrine. Some poorly crystalline forms of quartz are also known, such as chalcedony, chrysoprase, carnelian, agate, onyx, jasper, heliotrope, and flint. Other modifications of silicon dioxide are known in some other minerals such as tridymite and cristobalite, as well as the much less common coesite and <b>stishovite.</b> Biologically generated forms are {{also known as}} kieselguhr and diatomaceous earth. Vitreous silicon dioxide is known as tectites, and obsidian, and rarely as lechatelierite. Some synthetic forms are known as keatite and W-silica. Opals are composed of complicated crystalline aggregates of partially hydrated silicon dioxide.|$|E
2500|$|The two {{predominant}} polymorphs of GeO2 are hexagonal and tetragonal. Hexagonal GeO2 has {{the same}} structure as β-quartz, with germanium having coordination number 4. [...] Tetragonal GeO2 (the mineral argutite) has the rutile-like structure seen in <b>stishovite.</b> [...] In this motif, germanium has the coordination number 6. [...] An amorphous (glassy) form of GeO2 is similar to fused silica.|$|E
2500|$|In {{physical}} terms, a {{shock wave}} originates {{from the point}} of contact. [...] As this shock wave expands, it decelerates and compresses the impactor, and it accelerates and compresses the target. Stress levels within the shock wave far exceed the strength of solid materials; consequently, both the impactor and the target close to the impact site are irreversibly damaged. [...] Many crystalline minerals can be transformed into higher-density phases by shock waves; for example, the common mineral quartz can be transformed into the higher-pressure forms coesite and <b>stishovite.</b> [...] Many other shock-related changes take place within both impactor and target as the shock wave passes through, and some of these changes can be used as diagnostic tools to determine whether particular geological features were produced by impact cratering.|$|E
2500|$|Forming 12% of the Earth's crust, quartz (SiO2) is {{the most}} {{abundant}} mineral species. It is characterized by its high chemical and physical resistivity. Quartz has several polymorphs, including tridymite and cristobalite at high temperatures, high-pressure coesite, and ultra-high pressure <b>stishovite.</b> The latter mineral can only be formed on Earth by meteorite impacts, and its structure has been composed {{so much that it}} had changed from a silicate structure to that of rutile (TiO2). The silica polymorph that is most stable at the Earth's surface is α-quartz. Its counterpart, β-quartz, is present only at high temperatures and pressures (changes to α-quartz below 573°C at 1 bar). These two polymorphs differ by a [...] "kinking" [...] of bonds; this change in structure gives β-quartz greater symmetry than α-quartz, and they are thus also called high quartz (β) and low quartz (α).|$|E
2500|$|The base of unit of a {{silicate}} mineral is the 4− tetrahedron. In {{the vast}} majority of cases, silicon is in four-fold or tetrahedral coordination with oxygen. In very high-pressure situations, silicon will be six-fold or octahedral coordination, such as in the perovskite structure or the quartz polymorph <b>stishovite</b> (SiO2). In the latter case, the mineral no longer has a silicate structure, but that of rutile (TiO2), and its associated group, which are simple oxides. These silica tetrahedra are then polymerized to some degree to create various structures, such as one-dimensional chains, two-dimensional sheets, and three-dimensional frameworks. The basic silicate mineral where no polymerization of the tetrahedra has occurred requires other elements to balance out the base 4- charge. In other silicate structures, different combinations of elements are required to balance out the resultant negative charge. It is common for the Si4+ to be substituted by [...] Al3+ because of similarity in ionic radius and charge; in those case, the 5− tetrahedra form the same structures as do the unsubstituted tetrahedra, but their charge-balancing requirements are different.|$|E
50|$|<b>Stishovite</b> can be {{separated}} from quartz by applying hydrogen fluoride (HF); unlike quartz, <b>stishovite</b> will not react.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike other silica polymorphs, {{the crystal}} {{structure}} of <b>stishovite</b> {{resembles that of}} rutile (TiO2). The silicon in <b>stishovite</b> adopts an octahedral coordination geometry, being bound to six oxides. Similarly, the oxides are three-connected, unlike low-pressure forms of SiO2. In most silicates, silicon is tetrahedral, being bound to four oxides. [...] It was long considered the hardest known oxide (~30 GPa Vickers); however, boron suboxide has been discovered in 2002 to be much harder. At normal temperature and pressure, <b>stishovite</b> is metastable.|$|E
50|$|Until recently, {{the only}} known occurrences of <b>stishovite</b> in nature formed at the very high shock {{pressures}} (>100 kbar or 10 GPa) and temperatures (> 1200 °C) present during hypervelocity meteorite impact into quartz-bearing rock. Minute amounts of <b>stishovite</b> have been found within diamonds, and post-stishovite phases were identified within ultra-high-pressure mantle rocks. <b>Stishovite</b> may also be synthesized by duplicating these conditions in the laboratory, either isostatically or through shock (see shocked quartz).At 4.287 g/cm3 it is second densest polymorph of silica, after seifertite. It has tetragonal crystal symmetry, P42/mnm, No.136, Pearson symbol tP6.|$|E
5000|$|A 2010 study {{reported}} the lead isotope dating in the Muonionalusta meteorite and concluded the <b>stishovite</b> was from an impact event {{hundreds of millions}} of years ago: [...] "The presence of <b>stishovite</b> signifies that this meteorite was heavily shocked, possibly during the 0.4 Ga years old breakup event indicated by cosmic ray exposure...." ...|$|E
50|$|Large natural {{crystals}} of <b>stishovite</b> {{are extremely}} rare {{and are usually}} found as clasts of 1 to 2 mm in length. When found, they {{can be difficult to}} distinguish from regular quartz without laboratory analysis. It has a vitreous luster, is transparent (or translucent), and is extremely hard. <b>Stishovite</b> usually sits as small rounded gravels in a matrix of other minerals.|$|E
50|$|The {{very high}} {{pressures}} associated with impacts {{can lead to}} the formation of high-pressure polymorphs of various minerals. Quartz may occur as either of its two high-pressure forms, coesite and <b>stishovite.</b> Coesite occasionally occurs associated with eclogites formed during very high pressure regional metamorphism but was first discovered in a meteorite crater in 1960. <b>Stishovite,</b> however, is only known from impact structures.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Structure== Shocked quartz is {{associated}} with two high-pressure polymorphs of silicon dioxide: coesite and <b>stishovite.</b> These polymorphs have a crystal structure different from standard quartz. This structure can be formed only by intense pressure (more than 2 gigapascals), but at moderate temperatures. High temperatures would anneal the quartz back to its standard form. Coesite and <b>stishovite</b> are also indicative of impact events (or nuclear explosion).|$|E

More importantly, any deviations from these standard parameters constitute microstructural differences or variations, which represent an approach to an amorphous, vitreous, or glassy solid.|$|E
5000|$|New {{analysis}} of this strongly shock-metamorphosed iron meteorite has shown a content of 8.4% nickel and trace amounts of rare elements—0.33 ppm gallium, 0.133 ppm germanium and 1.6 ppm iridium. It also contains the minerals chromite, daubréelite, schreibersite, akaganéite and inclusions of troilite.

5000|$|Chao {{worked on}} a variety of topics {{over the course of his}} USGS career, {{including}} engineering geology, economic geology, and coal petrology. However, he was best known for his work on impact geology and tektites. Shortly after he began work on tektites in 1960, Chao was given a sample of sandstone from the vicinity of Meteor Crater, Arizona. From this material, he was able to isolate an unusual mineral with high refractive index, which he showed to be a high-pressure polymorph of silicon dioxide. He named the new mineral coesite in honor of the scientist who had synthesized the same phase in the laboratory seven years earlier. [...] Several years later, Chao found a second high-pressure polymorph of silica in these rocks. It too had been previously synthesized in laboratory studies, but was not known to occur in nature. He named this mineral <b>stishovite</b> in honor of the person who had first made it, Russian physicist, Sergei Stishov. [...] Coesite and <b>stishovite</b> became known as hallmarks of impact crater events, which were essentially the only natural processes that produced high enough pressures to transform ordinary quartz into both of these dense minerals. Chao went on to find coesite and <b>stishovite</b> in rocks from the Ries Crater in Bavaria, Germany, establishing that this structure was also produced by impact cratering.|$|E
50|$|This kind of {{metamorphism}} {{occurs when}} either an extraterrestrial object (a meteorite for instance) collides with the Earth's surface or during an extremely violent volcanic eruption.
