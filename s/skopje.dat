5|$|<b>Skopje</b> {{economic}} life greatly benefited from {{its position in}} the middle of Turkish Europe. Until the 17th century, <b>Skopje</b> experienced a long golden age. Around 1650, the number of inhabitants in <b>Skopje</b> was between 30,000 and 60,000 and the city contained more than 10,000 houses. It was then one of the only big cities on the territory of future Yugoslavia, together with Belgrade and Sarajevo. At that time, Dubrovnik, which was a busy harbour, had not even 7,000 inhabitants. Following the Ottoman conquest, the city population changed. Christians were forcibly converted to Islam or were replaced by Turks and Jews. At that time, Christians of <b>Skopje</b> were mostly non converted Slavs and Albanians, but also Ragusan and Armenian tradesmen. Ottoman Turks drastically changed the appearance of the city. They organised the Bazaar with its caravanserais, mosques and baths.|$|E
5|$|<b>Skopje</b> {{has also}} several foreign {{cultural}} centres, {{such as a}} Goethe-Institut, a British Council, an Alliance française, an American Corner.|$|E
5|$|Skopje's citizenry is {{generally}} more educated {{than the rest}} of the country. For one, 16% of Skopjans graduated university in contrast to 10% for the rest of the country. The number of people with a complete lack of education or ones who received a partial education is lower in <b>Skopje</b> at 9% compared to the provincial average of 17%. 80% of Macedonian citizens who hold a PhD take up residence in <b>Skopje.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Skopje,</b> as the Republic of Macedonia as a whole, is characterised {{by a large}} ethnic diversity. The city {{is located}} in a region where Ethnic Albanians and Macedonians meet, and it welcomed Romani, Turks, Jews and Serbs {{throughout}} its history. <b>Skopje</b> was mainly a Muslim city until the 19th century, when large number of Christians started to settle there. According to the 2002 census, Macedonians were the largest ethnic group in <b>Skopje,</b> with 338,358 inhabitants, or 66.75% of the population. Then came Albanians with 103,891 inhabitants (20.49%), Roma people with 23,475 (4.63%), Serbs (14,298 inhabitants), Turks (8,595), Bosniaks (7,585) and Vlachs (2,557). 8,167 people did not belong to any of these groups.|$|E
5|$|Some {{areas of}} <b>Skopje</b> {{suffer from a}} certain anarchy because many houses and {{buildings}} were built without consent from the local authorities.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{from the}} end of the 10th century <b>Skopje</b> {{experienced}} a period of wars and political troubles. Bulgarian capital from 972 to 992, Samuil ruled it from 976 until 1004 when its governor Roman surrendered it to Byzantine Emperor Basil the Bulgar Slayer in 1004 in exchange of the titles of patrician and strategos. Later, <b>Skopje</b> was briefly seized twice by Slavic insurgents who wanted to restore a Bulgarian state. At first in 1040 under Peter Delyan's command, and in 1072 under the orders of Georgi Voyteh. In 1081, <b>Skopje</b> was captured by Norman troops led by Robert Guiscard and the city remained in their hands until 1088. <b>Skopje</b> was subsequently conquered by the Serbian Grand Prince Vukan in 1093, and again by the Normans four years later. However, because of epidemics and food shortage, Normans quickly surrendered to the Byzantines.|$|E
5|$|State of <b>Skopje</b> (Κράτος των Σκοπίων) {{refers to}} the Republic of Macedonia.|$|E
5|$|The Mayor of <b>Skopje</b> {{is elected}} every four years.|$|E
5|$|The city {{severely}} {{suffered from}} the Great Turkish War {{at the end of}} the 17th century and consequently experienced recession until the 19th century. In 1689, Austrians seized <b>Skopje</b> which was already weakened by a cholera epidemic. The same day, general Silvio Piccolomini set fire to the city to end the epidemic. It is however possible that he wanted to avenge damages that Turks caused in Vienna in 1683. <b>Skopje</b> burned during two days. The Austrian presence in Macedonia motivated Slav uprisings. Nevertheless, Austrians left the country within the year and Hajduks, leaders of the uprisings, had to follow them in their retreat north of the Balkans. Some were arrested by the Turks, such as Petar Karposh, who was impaled on <b>Skopje</b> Stone Bridge.|$|E
5|$|The main {{railway station}} in <b>Skopje</b> is {{serviced}} by the Belgrade-Thessaloniki and Skopje-Prishtina international lines. After {{the completion of}} the Corridor VIII railway scheduled for 2022, the city will also be linked to Tirana and Sofia. Daily trains also link <b>Skopje</b> with other Macedonian towns, such as Kumanovo, Kičevo, Štip, Bitola or Veles.|$|E
5|$|The mayor {{represents}} the City of <b>Skopje</b> {{and he can}} submit ideas to the Council. He manages the administrative bodies and their officials.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, <b>Skopje</b> greatly {{benefited from}} Socialist Yugoslav {{policies}} which encouraged {{industry and the}} development of Macedonian cultural institutions. Consequently, <b>Skopje</b> became home to a national library, a national philharmonic orchestra, a university and the Macedonian Academy. However, its post-war development was altered by the 1963 earthquake which occurred 26 July. Although relatively weak in magnitude, it caused enormous damage in the city and can be compared to the 1960 Agadir earthquake. The disaster killed 1,070 people, injuring 3,300 others. 16,000 people were buried alive in ruins and 70% of the population lost their home. Many educational facilities, factories and historical buildings were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|After the war, <b>Skopje</b> was in ruins. Most of the {{official}} buildings were restored or rebuilt, but the city experienced new plague and cholera epidemics and many inhabitants emigrated. The Ottoman Turkish Empire as a whole entered in recession and political decline. Many rebellions and pillages occurred in Macedonia during the 18th century, either led by Turkish outlaws, Janissaries or Hajduks. An estimation conducted by French officers around 1836 revealed that at that time <b>Skopje</b> only had around 10,000 inhabitants. It was largely overwhelmed by two towns of the present-day Republic of Macedonia: Bitola (40,000) and Štip (15–20,000).|$|E
5|$|Before the Austro-Turkish {{war and the}} 1698 Great Fire, <b>Skopje</b> was one of {{the biggest}} cities in the Balkans, with a {{population}} estimated between 30,000 and 60,000 inhabitants. After the fire, it experienced a long period of decline and only had 10,000 inhabitants in 1836. However, the population started to rise again after 1850 and reached 32,000 inhabitants in 1905. In the 20th century, <b>Skopje</b> {{was one of the}} fastest growing cities in Yugoslavia and it has 448,200 inhabitants in 1971. Since then, the demographic growth has continued at a steady pace.|$|E
5|$|His {{university}} {{studies on}} urbanism {{put him in}} an ideal position to handle redevelopment projects after the Second World War. His ideas were explored in designs for Tokyo and <b>Skopje.</b> Tange's work influenced a generation of architects across the world.|$|E
5|$|In 1877, <b>Skopje</b> {{was chosen}} as the capital city of the new Kosovo Vilayet, which {{encompassed}} present-day Kosovo, northwestern Macedonia and the Sanjak of Novi Pazar. In 1905, the city had 32,000 inhabitants, making it the largest of the vilayet, although closely followed by Prizren with its 30,000 inhabitants. Of the <b>Skopje</b> Muslim population of the late Ottoman period German linguist Gustav Weigand noted that though most were Albanians regarded as Turks or Ottomans (Osmanli), they spoke Turkish in public and Albanian at home. At the beginning of the 20th century, local economy was focused on dyeing, weaving, tanning, ironworks and wine and flour processing.|$|E
5|$|Outside of {{the urban}} area, the City of <b>Skopje</b> {{encompasses}} many small settlements. Some of them are becoming outer suburbs, such as Singeliḱ, located {{on the road to}} Belgrade, which has more than 23,000 inhabitants, and Dračevo, which has almost 20,000 inhabitants. Other large settlements are located north of the city, such as Radišani, with 9,000 inhabitants, whereas smaller villages can be found on Mount Vodno or in Saraj municipality, which is the most rural of the ten municipalities that form the City of <b>Skopje.</b>|$|E
5|$|Religious {{affiliation}} is diverse: Macedonians, Serbs and Vlachs {{are mainly}} Orthodox, while Albanians, Turks and Roma (Gypsies) are usually Muslim, although there exists an almost {{equal number of}} Orthodox Romani. <b>Skopje</b> also has a Catholic Albanian minority, to which belonged Mother Teresa.|$|E
5|$|<b>Skopje</b> Fortress was rebuilt {{several times}} before it was {{destroyed}} by the 1963 earthquake. Since then, it has been restored to its medieval appearance. It is the only medieval monument in <b>Skopje,</b> but several churches located around the city illustrate the Vardar architectural school which flourished around 1300. Among these churches are the ones around Matka Canyon (St Nicholas, St Andrew and Matka churches). The church of St. Panteleimon in Gorno Nerezi dates from the 12th century. Its expressive frescoes anticipate the Italian primitives.|$|E
