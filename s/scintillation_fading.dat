40|$|Abstract:- Wireless {{communication}} in the millimetre frequency bands is subject to severe atmospheric impairment caused by rain and scintillation, which may occasionally cause deep fades and thus needs to be mitigated by an efficient countermeasure such as adaptive coding and modulation (ACM). In this paper we focus on stratospheric communication and propose appropriate rain and <b>scintillation</b> <b>fading</b> channel models, which we use to describe the conceptual design of adaptive coding and modulation on four reference theoretical ACM schemes. Rain fading is modelled according to the modified DLR segment approach for generating channel attenuation time series, taking into consideration the specifics of stratospheric communication systems, namely the variable elevation angle and different carrier frequency. Additional fading due to scintillation, which may be harmful in deep fades caused by the rain, is modelled by adjusting the satellite scintillation channel model so {{that the amount of}} <b>scintillation</b> <b>fading</b> is correlated to the attenuation caused by the rain. We describe two extreme approaches to the ACM design process, one for maximizing the system reliability and the other for maximizing the system throughput. We present simulation results for four representative theoretical ACM schemes with different SNR ranges as the variation of bandwidth efficiency in time, and as system outage probability. Finally we show that, for a given SNR range, increasing system complexity by increasing the number of different coding-modulation (CM) modes beyond a certain optimum value does not yield...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Even if a {{line-of-sight}} {{condition of}} Free Space Optics (FSO) is satisfied, atmospheric-induced fading, scattering, and attenuation may severely deteriorate {{the availability of}} the communication link. This argument is true except in reconfigurable FSO ad hoc networks, a path reconfiguration scheme replaces a severed FSO link with an operational one. Reconfigurability, as a property of our hybrid FSO/RF (Radio Frequency) work in progress, provides connection reliability and network throughput. The traffic can be directed to a different FSO link or even an RF link as backup. Hence, node failure and outage probabilities due to link failure will be reduced, thus resulting in a higher availability of nodes. Mathematical investigation and statistical consideration of availability and capacity of FSO/RF ad hoc mesh network is the focus of this paper.

Moreover, {{we have used a}} multipath elimination technique to distinguish whether the S 4 measurements were caused by scintillation or multipath (Van Dierendonck et al. 1993). In fact, the receiver collects raw sigma code/carrier divergence (difference between code and carrier pseudorange) every second. The average and standard deviation of the sigma code/carrier divergence are then computed every minute in which S 4 is calculated. These values are indicative of multipath and can be used to distinguish between S 4 due to multipath and S 4 due to scintillation. In other words, this elimination process is based upon a comparison of the sigma code/carrier divergence measurement to the S 4 measured (Van Dierendonck et al. 1993). This implies that, if the pseudorange error is less than a linear function of S 4, the S 4 is recognized to be due to scintillation.

The occurrence, {{as well as the}} intensity of scintillations, is found to be strongly dependant on both the season of the year and the sunspot number. Strong (S 4 -index > 0.45) and fast <b>fading</b> <b>scintillations</b> (<b>fading</b> rates > 40 fads/min) observed during the post-sunset hours of equinoxes and winter months manifest as several short duration patches at both VHF (244 MHz) and L-band (1.5 GHz) frequencies and are found to be always associated with the range or total Spread-F on ionograms and bubbles/depletions in the Total Electron Content (TEC) measured from a colocated dual frequency GPS receiver, suggesting that these scintillations are of the Plasma Bubble Induced (PBI) type. On the other hand, relatively weak and slow <b>fading</b> <b>scintillations</b> (<b>fading</b> rates < 8 fads/min) observed around the post-midnight hours of the summer months which appear as long-duration patches (> 3 hr) at 244 MHz signal (with practically no scintillation activity at the L-band frequencies) are often found to be associated with frequency Spread-F on ionograms with no depletions in TEC. Further, the presence of Fresnel oscillations observed in the spectrum of 244 MHz suggests that the long-duration scintillations observed are due to the presence of a thin layer of irregularities in the bottom side F-region which are generally known as Bottom Side Sinusoidal (BSS) irregularities. Further, the PBI-type scintillations at L-band frequencies are often found to exceed 10 dB power levels (S 4 > 0.45) even during the low sunspot activity period of 2004 – 2005, and cause Loss of Lock in the GPS receivers resulting in a total interruption in the received signals.|$|R

However, distinguishing actual scintillation from rapid variations of rain attenuation {{in the presence}} of rain is not straightforward to Marzano and d'Auria (1998).

Ionospheric <b>scintillation</b> <b>fading</b> produced by irregularities has been observed at 136 MHz (vhf), 400 MHz (uhf), 1550 MHz (L-band) and 1700 to 2200 MHz (S-band). Details of these observations are presented. Vhf scintillation effects are evident in both auroral and equatorial regions. Fading effects decrease with increasing radio frequency in the auroral region. The same frequency dependence for fading is not observed in the equatorial region. Although there is a seasonal and diurnal character to scintillation in the equatorial region, fading effects are usually more severe than in the auroral region for a given radio frequency. Space diversity measurements indicate that reasonable solutions for vhf telemetry problems are available for either region. Space diversity should provide a solution for microwave frequencies as well. Ionospheric fading amplitude for 1700 MHz is relatively small in the auroral region. In the equatorial region amplitude fading levels for 1550 -MHz signals from ATS- 5 are often much larger than expected.

The huge amount of data exchange between satellites and ground stations demands enormous capacity that cannot be provided by strictly regulated, scarce resources of the Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum.

Furthermore, due to the spatial confinement of laser beams, such links are very secure. In other words, security is guaranteed at the physical layer. However, the promised enormous data rates are only available under clear weather conditions, and atmospheric phenomena such as clouds, fog, and even turbulence can degrade the performance, dramatically. While turbid media such as clouds and aerosols cause pulse broadening in space and time, turbulence presents itself as <b>scintillation</b> and <b>fading.</b> Hence, to exploit the great potentials of FSO at its best under all weather conditions, prudent measures must be taken in the design of transmitter and receiver.

40|$|Ionospheric {{scintillation}} is {{the name}} given to the disturbance caused by electron density irregularities along the propagation path of electromagnetic waves through the ionosphere. These non-nominal propagation conditions mainly cause carrier phase variations and amplitude fades. It is {{important to point out}} that both degradations are correlated, and thus deep amplitude fades and rapid phase variations (the so-called canonical fades) occur in a simultaneous and random manner. Regarding the carrier synchronization problem under harsh propagation conditions, such as high dynamics, multipath effects or ionospheric <b>scintillation,</b> canonical <b>fades</b> make the latter the most challenging scenario, which can be considered as a benchmark on the performance of robust carrier tracking techniques. This phenomenon particularly affects satellite-based positioning systems in the equatorial regions and at high latitudes. In this work, both amplitude and phase variations due to scintillation are first modeled using an autoregressive (AR) model, and then included into the system state-space formulation. Therefore, a Kalman filter (KF) based solution can be aware of both dynamics and scintillation phase evolutions. This arises as the natural solution to mitigate those undesired propagation effects. Moreover, in order to counteract the main drawbacks of standard KF-based tracking solutions, an extended KF (EKF) architecture is considered, tracking both the phase dynamics, scintillation phase and amplitude.

To validate the designed GPS receiver, a GPS channel model for aircraft landing in equatorial regions is built based on the use of a high delity GPS constellation simulator, a clock emulator, and real GPS data from the equator that contains an abundance of ionospheric scintillation...|$|R
40|$|Ionospheric scintillations {{are known}} to be rather {{challenging}} in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receivers. The scintillation effects include rapid variations in signal phase and amplitude, which may hinder the receiver to acquire and track the signal and may cause a loss of lock at GNSS receiver. This thesis focuses on the scintillation effects on the European GNSS namely, Galileo. Abrupt phase variations during transmission cause deep power fades called canonical fading, half cycle slips and frequency unlock. Phase locked loop designs that are currently available helps in reducing the scintillation effects to some extent, though this is complicated when scintillation is severe. This thesis focuses on investigating some of the scintillation effects on Galileo signal during acquisition. The considered performance criteria are the detection performance and the root mean square error at the receiver. For implementing this task, this thesis uses two toolboxes, namely Cornell Scintillation toolbox for generating synthetic scintillation time histories and TUT MBOC tracking model for simulating and studying the scintillation effects at the receiver. Cornell Scintillation toolbox generates synthetic amplitude and phase time histories based on two input parameters namely, scintillation intensity and decorrelation time that show how rapidly the signal amplitude and phase change. TUT MBOC acquisition and tracking simulator generates Galileo E 1 signal that undergoes MBOC modulation and it is transmitted through multipath Nakagami-m fading channels. The thesis work focused on merging the scintillation time histories generated by Cornell scintillation toolbox with the TUT MBOC acquisition tracking algorithm, by adding the <b>scintillation</b> to <b>fading</b> channel. By calculating the Line of Sight (LOS) phase delay, the acquisition of the received signal is performed with and without scintillations. The obtained results with and without scintillations are compared and studied in order to evaluate the impact of scintillations on the European GNSS...|$|R
