The Raw after Backlash, Eric Bischoff ordered a No Disqualification match between him and Stratus. If Stratus won, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> a championship rematch the next week; if Bischoff won, he would get to spend a night with her. Bischoff {{would go on to}} win the match, though the stipulation was nulified when Linda McMahon confronted him after the match.|$|E
5|$|Banai is {{believed}} to the daughter of Indra, {{the king of the}} gods. Banai was found by Dhangar shepherd, when she was abandoned on earth by an angry Indra. When Banai grew up, it was predicted that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> her match at Jejuri. There, she felt in love with God Khandoba. Khandoba also fell in her love. Khandoba accepted a self-exile for 12 years by intentionally losing a game of chess(Saripat) to his wife Mhalsa. He took disguise of shepherd and started serving Banai's father. One day, Khandoba killed all the sheep and goats of Banai' father and promised to make them alive again if he was married to Banai. The reluctant Banai was married to Khandoba, the shepherd in disguise at Naldurg. Khandoba revealed his real form to Banai on their way back to Jejuri.|$|E

25|$|Judit {{started playing}} in tournaments at 6 years old, and by age 9, her rating with the Hungarian Chess Federation was 2080. She {{was a member}} of a chess club in Budapest, where <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> {{experience}} from master level players. In 1984, in Budapest, Sophia and Judit, at the time 9 and 7 years of age, respectively, played two games of blindfold chess against two masters, which they won. At one point, the girls complained that one of their opponents was playing too slowly and suggested a clock should be used.|$|E
25|$|Kate {{heard the}} crash, and knew an {{eastbound}} passenger train {{was due in}} Moingona about midnight, stopping shortly before heading east over the Des Moines River and then Honey Creek. She found the surviving crew members and shouted that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> help, having to cross the Des Moines River bridge along the way. Although she started with a lantern, it went out, and she crawled the span {{on her hands and}} knees with only lightning for illumination. Once across, she had to cover about two miles on ground to the Moingona depot to sound the alarm. She then led a party back to rescue two of the crew members. Edgar Wood, perched in a tree, grasped a rope thrown to him, and came ashore hand-over-hand. Adam Agar couldn't be reached until the floodwaters began to recede. Pat Donahue's corpse was eventually found in a cornfield a quarter mile downstream from the bridge, but A.P. Olmsted was never found. The passenger train was stopped at Scranton, with about 200 aboard.|$|E

500|$|A strong {{believer in}} fate, Marlohe stated that she dreamt of acting {{alongside}} Javier Bardem {{six months before}} her Bond audition, and interpreted it as a positive sign that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> the part. To prepare for the role, she studied the script closely, and received special training {{on the use of}} firearms. Following the film's release, Marlohe called the role a [...] "turning point in [...] career" [...] as it led to further acting opportunities, and her decision to work with a Hollywood talent agent.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Darla was well-received by Eric Goldman of IGN. He said: [...] "As {{the very first}} character seen on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Julie Benz instantly made an impression as the vampiress Darla. For the next 8 television seasons, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> to show many different facets of the role, as not even dying (twice!) could keep Darla from being {{an important part of}} the story and mythos behind Buffy the Vampire Slayer and the spinoff series Angel, the latter of which allowed Benz to greatly expand her character." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Cindy Williams {{was cast}} as Laurie Henderson, the actress hoped <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> {{the part of}} Debbie Dunham, which ended up going to Candy Clark. Mackenzie Phillips, who portrays Carol, was only 12 years old, and under California law, {{producer}} Gary Kurtz had to become her legal guardian {{for the duration of}} filming. For Bob Falfa, Roos cast Harrison Ford, who was then concentrating on a carpentry career. Ford agreed to take the role on the condition that he would not have to cut his hair. The character has a flattop in the script, but a compromise was eventually reached whereby Ford wore a stetson to cover his hair. Producer Francis Ford Coppola encouraged Lucas to cast Wolfman Jack as himself in a cameo appearance. [...] "George Lucas and I went through thousands of Wolfman Jack phone calls that were taped with the public," [...] Jack reflected. [...] "The telephone calls [...] in the motion picture and on the soundtrack were actual calls with real people." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} form the father-daughter bond needed for their {{respective}} roles, both Novakovic and Winton introduced each other to their families. The actors {{spent a lot of}} time together, to ensure they were comfortable together on and off screen. Natasha's father, Michael, is a widower and she is his only child. Bower revealed Natasha has her father wrapped around her finger. Michael dotes upon Natasha and Bower opined Natasha causes havoc because he is not strict with her. Winton said he thinks Michael is not handling things with Natasha [...] "too poorly", but she does make things difficult for him. During a 2011 interview with Channel 5, Winton said that Michael and Natasha's relationship had become tortured. Winton stated that Michael wishes Natasha would stop lying to him and hoped <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> her act together, so they could have some semblance of a father/daughter relationship. Winton wanted Michael to build a better relationship with Natasha in the future as he loves her, despite the things she has done.|$|E
500|$|The drug itself, lithium, is {{typically}} {{used as a}} mood stabilizer to prevent acute manic behavior in patients with bipolar disorder. Lee chose the title as a [...] "metaphor for happiness from a negative point of view": [...] "It's looking at it like, 'I don't want to numb myself and not feel anymore'." [...] She explained that during her process of writing music, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> into a mood or a [...] "strange low that I ride" [...] that she would try to overcome by telling herself {{to let go of}} certain things, change and rejoice again; such experiences also inspired her to write [...] "Lithium". Initially, Lee was indecisive as to which song to choose as the second single from The Open Door, having in mind four different album tracks. [...] "Lithium" [...] was eventually chosen and made available for digital download on December 4, 2006. It was physically released in the United Kingdom on January 8, 2007. [...] "The Last Song I'm Wasting on You", a track originally written for The Open Door and later included as a bonus track on several editions of the album, was the single's B-side.|$|E
500|$|Annoyed that Peter {{spends more}} time {{watching}} television than with his own family, Lois suggests he teach Meg how to drive. Peter reluctantly agrees, and unwittingly gives Meg a series of bad driving tips, including instructing her to [...] "rev" [...] her engine twice at stop lights and challenge other drivers to a race, which causes her to ultimately fail her driving test. As Peter drives them home from the DMV he notices that a show he wanted to watch is on television in a nearby house. Distracted by the show, he crashes the car into the main cable television transmitter, knocking out reception for the whole entire town of Quahog. Panicking, Peter makes a promise to Meg so that if she takes the blame for knocking down the cable transmitter, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> a new convertible when she finally gets her licence. Once they arrive home with the transmitter still attached to the car, Lois becomes furious with Peter for placing the blame on his own daughter. Meg, of course, is blamed, {{and is about to}} admit the truth, but then decides to keep quiet, reflecting with an inner voice, a reference to The Wonder Years, at school. This shows an incredible lack of good judgment and morals by Peter. Meanwhile, Stewie, (seeing the opportunity of the dish attached to car), steals the satellite dish in a plan to create a weather control device capable of destroying the world's supply of broccoli, since Lois had forced him to eat the vegetable earlier that day.|$|E

500|$|In February 2009, Lovato {{started to}} work and {{recorded}} on her second album, right after filming from the first season of Sonny with a Chance. In April 2009, Lovato explained about the album's process and collaborating with songwriters from the album including Jon McLaughlin and The Academy Is... lead singer William Beckett. According to Lovato, the album's writing process was nearly finished in just two weeks, noting that she [...] "basically went from full time acting mode to full time album mode". As she wanted to accomplish more [...] "John Mayer-ish type of songs", she contacted Mayer's management in order to collaborate him, citing {{him as one of}} her biggest musical influences. Mayer accepted the offer, of which Lovato said, [...] "I was completely shocked [...] It was more of a pipe dream. I didn't ever {{think it would be a}} reality, but it came true. He was taking a chance on working with a younger artist in the pop realm." [...] The two wrote three songs together, [...] "World of Chances", [...] "Love is the Answer" [...] and [...] "Shut Up and Love Me". Lovato said that it was intimidating to work with him as she was worried that he would not like her lyrics, and <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> [...] "super excited" [...] whenever he complimented her. [...] "World of Chances", the first song she wrote with Mayer, was the only of these songs to make the album's final cut. The song was inspired by Lovato's first experience of love and heartbreak.|$|E
500|$|Beginning with Caged Bird, Angelou {{used the}} same [...] "writing ritual" [...] for many years. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> up at {{five in the morning}} and check into a hotel room, where the staff were {{instructed}} to remove any pictures from the walls. [...] She wrote on yellow legal pads while lying on the bed, with a bottle of sherry, a deck of cards to play solitaire, Roget's Thesaurus, and the Bible, and left by the early afternoon. [...] She averaged 10–12 pages of material a day, which she edited down to three or four pages in the evening. [...] Lupton stated that this ritual indicated [...] "a firmness of purpose and an inflexible use of time". Angelou went through this process to give herself time to turn the events of her life into art, and to [...] "enchant" [...] herself; as she said in a 1989 interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation, to [...] "relive the agony, the anguish, the Sturm und Drang". [...] She placed herself back in the time she wrote about, even during traumatic experiences like her rape in Caged Bird, to [...] "tell the human truth" [...] about her life. Critic Opal Moore says about Caged Bird: [...] "...Though easily read, [...] is no 'easy read'". Angelou stated that she played cards to reach that place of enchantment, to access her memories more effectively. She has stated, [...] "It may take an hour to get into it, but once I'm in it—ha! It's so delicious!" [...] She did not find the process cathartic; rather, she found relief in [...] "telling the truth".|$|E
500|$|On October 18, 2016, an {{anonymous}} woman sued Michael Jackson's Estate, MJJ Productions and MJJ Ventures, alleging {{she had been}} sexually-abused by Jackson when she was 12-15, from 1986-1989 in Jackson's Encino home, hotels, the [...] "Smooth Criminal" [...] set, the [...] "Moonwalker" [...] movie set, {{in the back of}} his limousine, his Neverland Ranch, and an apartment/condo he nicknamed [...] "The Hideout". She provided letters, love notes allegedly written by Jackson, multiple gifts apparently given by Jackson, a jacket he supposedly gave to her after an Album photo-shoot, checks given to her from 1990-1993 totaling $920,000 sent from Michael Jackson, MJJ Ventures, and MJJ Productions—coming directly from Jackson's back-accounts, and a 1993 Santa Barbara PD letter alleging that the Police Department concluded she [...] "knew all about Child Abuse" [...] to come in and speak to them, regarding their investigation. Her complaint alleges that she never considered her emotional/psychological injuries to be a result of her sexual activities with Jackson until she reflected on those experiences for the first time in September 2016, and that even if she had wanted to she could not possibly come forward earlier because she was threatened with physical harm if she ever told anyone, told that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> in trouble with law enforcement and go to jail if she did, and that Jackson made her promise not to tell anyone. A lawyer for the Businesses dismissed the allegations saying, [...] "This is yet another attempt to hit the lottery by suing the estate of Michael Jackson more than seven years after Michael's death and close to 30 years after these incidents supposedly occurred. We believe this claim was created from whole cloth and is without any merit. It's also no coincidence that this woman is represented by the same attorneys involved in two other frivolous claims against the estate." ...|$|E
