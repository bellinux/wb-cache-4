40|$|<b>Sudeck's</b> <b>critical</b> <b>point</b> at the rectosigmoid {{junction}} {{is described}} as the point of origin of the last sigmoid arterial branch, originating from the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). There is controversy {{on the importance of}} Sudeck's point, and the frequency in which the anastomosis is found. Furthermore, the diameter of the anastomosis, if present, may also impact on the viability of the caudal stump. This study aimed to determine the frequency in which a macroscopic anastomosis occurs, between the superior rectal artery and the last sigmoidal branch, in a cadaver population; the diameter of this anastomosis and the distance from the origin of the IMA to Sudeck's point. Sixty-four cadavers were included in the study, excluding those with previous surgery to the rectosigmoid junction. Sudeck's point was carefully identified and dissected to establish the presence of an anastomosis. Subsequent measurements were performed using a digital caliper (accuracy = 0. 01 mm). A macroscopic anastomosis was absent in three cases (4. 7 %). The mean diameter of the anastomosis when present was 1. 9 mm (SD: 0. 5 mm), and the distance from the origin of the IMA to Sudeck's point was 55. 5 mm (SD: 14. 6 mm). Although an anastomosis is present in the majority of cases, the vessel is very small in diameter, and may not be sufficient {{to meet the demands of}} the caudal stump. The distance from the origin of the IMA to Sudeck's point is sufficient enough to allow for ligation of the IMA proximal to Sudeck's point...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to study the nature of the Andrews <b>critical</b> <b>point</b> in the gas-liquid transition in a physical-vapor transport (PVT) system. A dynamical model, consistent with the van der Waals equation near the Andrews <b>critical</b> <b>point,</b> is derived. With this model, we deduce two physical parameters, which interact exactly at the Andrews <b>critical</b> <b>point,</b> and which dictate the dynamic transition behavior near the Andrews <b>critical</b> <b>point.</b> In particular, it is shown that 1) the gas-liquid co-existence curve can be extended beyond the Andrews <b>critical</b> <b>point,</b> and 2) the transition is first order before the <b>critical</b> <b>point,</b> second-order at the <b>critical</b> <b>point,</b> and third order beyond the Andrews <b>critical</b> <b>point.</b> This clearly explains why it is hard to observe the gas-liquid phase transition beyond the Andrews <b>critical</b> <b>point.</b> Furthermore, the analysis leads naturally the introduction of a general asymmetry principle of fluctuations and the preferred transition mechanism for a thermodynamic system.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} to finding <b>critical</b> <b>points</b> in cell-wise barycentrically or bilinearly interpolated vector fields on surfaces. The Poincar index of the <b>critical</b> <b>points</b> is determined by investigating the qualitative behavior of 0 -level sets of the interpolants of the vector field components in parameter space using precomputed combinatorial results, thus avoiding the computation of the Jacobian of the vector field at the <b>critical</b> <b>points</b> {{in order to determine}} its index. The locations of the <b>critical</b> <b>points</b> within a cell are determined analytically to achieve accurate results. This approach leads to a correct treatment of cases with two first-order <b>critical</b> <b>points</b> or one second-order <b>critical</b> <b>point</b> of bilinearly interpolated vector fields within one cell, which would be missed by examining the linearized field only.
