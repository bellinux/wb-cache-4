The experiments {{were concerned with}} heavy-restraint Y- and U-Groove multipass cracking tests of shielded-metal arc (SMAW) and submerged-arc (SAW) weld metals. Results of tensile tests, hardness surveys, weld residual stress measurements and microstructural investigations are discussed. The analytical phase comprised numerical calculations for analysing the interactions between crack-controlling factors. The objectives were: (i) the assessment of WM hydrogen cracking risk by defining the Crack-No Crack boundary conditions in terms of 'safe line' description giving the desired lower-bound estimates, and (ii) to derive predictive equations capable of giving reliable estimates of the required preheat/interpass temperature T 0 /Ti for the avoidance of cracking. Hydrogen cracking occurred predominantly in high <b>strength</b> <b>weld</b> metals of Rp 0. 2 ≈ 580 - 900 MPa. At intermediate strengths of Rp 0. 2 ≈ 500 - 550 MPa, cracking {{took place in the}} cases where the holding time from welding to NDT inspection was prolonged to 7 days. Low strength WMs of Rp 0. 2 ≤ 480 MPa did not exhibit cracking under any conditions examined. Cracking occurrence was, above all, governed by WM tensile <b>strength,</b> <b>weld</b> diffusible hydrogen and weld residual stresses amounting to the yield strength. The appearance of cracking vanished when transferring from 40 to 6 mm thick welds. The implications of the holding time were more significant than anticipated previously. A period of 16 hrs in accordance with SFS-EN 1011 appeared much too short for thick multipass welds. Interpass time and heat input showed no measurable effect on cracking sensitivity, hence being of secondary importance. Equations were derived to assess the weld critical hydrogen content Hcr corresponding to the Crack-No Crack conditions as a function of either weld metal Pcm, yield strength Rp 0. 2 or weld metal maximum hardness HV 5 (max). For the calculation of safe T 0 /Ti estimates, a formula incorporating: (i) WM strength as a linear function of either weld carbon equivalent CET or weld HV 5 (max), (ii) weld build-up thickness aw in the form of tanh expression and (iii) weld diffusible hydrogen HD in terms of a combined [ln / power law] expression was found descriptive...|$|E

40|$|International audienceOn {{the shop}} floor, as in laboratories, {{destructive}} testing remains the main means of quality control of spot welds. After hand or mechanized weld destruction, the so-called "plug diameter" is measured {{and is usually}} considered a good indicator of the weld quality. However, {{it turns out that}} the "plug" failure of spot welds is far from being the rule. Moreover, fracture may occur in different zones of the weld, leading to very different meanings of the plug diameter. Therefore, the plug diameter is most of the time not well-correlated with the weld strength, which is the main value of the spot weld. Partial or full interfacial failures (through the weld nugget) exhibit equivalent mechanical strengths and therefore should not be rejected. Through this work, it is shown that the failure type depends on various parameters (nugget diameter, sheet thickness, loading mode, [...] .), and consequently, it is not an intrinsic property of the steel grade. In this way, recommended quality criteria are based on weld <b>strength,</b> <b>weld</b> diameter (including the interfacial fracture area if any), or absorbed energy independently of failure occurrence.

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{to model}} the weld between the constituent bodies of a bimetallic configuration is presented for estimating the effect of strength gradient across the weld interface oil crack growth characteristics under fatigue load. The constituent bodies and the interface weld have similar elastic and thermal expansion properties but different plastic properties. A Mode I crack is in parent sort alloy steel (ASTM 4340) which grows perpendicularly towards the ultra strong weld of maraging steel (MDN 250). A cyclic plastic or cohesive zone develops ahead of the crack tip under fatigue load. This zone penetrates into the weld, possibly crossing over into maraging steel, as the crack grows nearer to the weld which causes the drop in stress intensity parameter at the crack tip from the applied value. The cohesive zone split across the weld interface is modeled in linear elastic regime {{with the help of}} Kolosov-Muskhelishvili complex potentials leading to a computational model for assessing the effect of the weld on the advancing crack. Paris law based on cyclic crack tip stress intensity parameter is used to estimate the crack growth rate. Theoretical assessment is substantiated with the help of experiments. Bimetallic compact tension specimens, prepared by electron beam welding of the steels, are subjected to high cycle fatigue load to measure crack growth rates in them. Results of the bimetallic specimens are analyzed and compared with those of the plain alloy steel specimen. Influence of ultra high <b>strength</b> <b>weld</b> substantially reduces the growth rate of the approaching crack resulting in enhanced fatigue life of the bimetallic body.

Results of welding high carbon steel are presented. The weld characteristics related to the fast cooling rate were critically evaluated and methods to reduce the rate of cooling were developed. The grain size produced in the fusion and narrow heat affected zones significantly affected the mechanical properties of the welded joint. Three lasers were used: Nd:YAG, CO 2 and a high power laser diode (HPDL). The investigations were carried out using a pulsed, 400 W, Nd:YAG laser, a CW, 1. 2 kW, CO 2 laser and a CW, 1. 4 kW high power diode laser. For the Nd:YAG laser, the dual beam delivery system was achieved with a step index fibre to produce in-line process heat-treatment during welding. The spatial and temporal temperature distribution was controlled in the weld region to generate the desired mechanical properties, without losing the benefits of this low distortion joining process.

At the present moment, primary fabrication processes for Nitinol-based devices include laser cutting and manual techniques. As {{the interest in}} incorporating Nitinol in different micro applications and devices increases, the development of effective technology for micro-welding of Nitinol becomes necessary. In general, welding processes may induce significant changes to the processed area rendering the component incompatible or unusable. Strength reduction, inclusions of intermetallic compounds, and changes in pseudoelastic and shape memory effects are all examples of how Nitinol can be affected by welding. The current study has {{examined the effects of}} two welding techniques on Nitinol: micro-resistance spot welding (MRSW) and laser micro-welding (LMW). Ni-rich Nitinol wires were welded in a crossed-wire configuration at different energy inputs by varying welding currents for MRSW and peak powers for LMW. The characterization of weld properties focused on the mechanical properties and bonding mechanisms, weld microstructure and formation, and phase transformation temperatures. Additionally, the effects of surface oxide on joint performance were also examined. During MRSW, the primary bonding mechanism was solid state, which consisted of 6 main stages: cold collapse, dynamic recrystallization, interfacial melting, squeeze out, excessive flash, and surface melting. Attempt was made to correlate the joining mechanism with the contact resistances. Joint strength and fracture mechanism were closely linked to the metallurgical properties of the welds.

For E 9010 electrodes, a preheat of 40 °C or more was found to be effective and For E 6010 electrodes, a preheat of 30 °C or more was effective in avoiding cold cracks in the weld metal. Most of the cracks found on welds preheated at room temperature were initiated by a defective weld feature such as undercut or lack of penetration. An attempt was made to correlate the hardness values and carbon equivalents (IIW) of weld metal to cracking. However, it was found that there was no significant effect of these variables on cracking over the range of welding conditions investigated. The cracking morphology studies indicated that there are many ways in which the crack can propagate in the weld and HAZ. The modes of cracking observed were microvoid coalescence, quasi cleavage and intergranular. In some cases solidification cracking was detected. The testing program indicated that despite the high hydrogen content of the weld metal for E 9010 electrodes, crack-free root pass welds can be obtained for 8. 6 mm X 80 steel strip provided a preheat of 40 °C or higher is used to ensure a low cooling rate...|$|E
40|$|Patented in 1960, {{ultrasonic}} welding for metals, has received significant research {{and there have}} been advances in the technology. Because of these advances, the process has been developed into a practical production tool. Although the ultrasonic metal welding has many advantages including speed, efficiency, long tool life, there are several issues. For example, tool/part adhesion (sticking), part marking and the lack of the consistency and predictability of the weld strength are issues that industry currently encounters with ultrasonic metal welding. To resolve these issues of the ultrasonic metal welding process, various experiments have been conducted on aluminum 5754 alloy samples. These experiments included replacing a constant amplitude with amplitude profiling and placing buffer sheets of copper and zinc between the tool (horn) and the top part prior to {{ultrasonic welding}}. In addition, experiments were conducted to compare the consistency of weld strength for the three control modes: energy, height (post height), and time. Their results were analyzed and compared in terms of weld <b>strength,</b> <b>weld</b> consistency and weld quality.;It was seen that amplitude profiling produced an increase in weld strength, however the part marking and the tool/part adhesion were not reduced. By matching the amplitude to the various weld phases, the weld cycle was optimized to produce relatively strong welds and weld cycle time was reduced. For example, by initiating the weld cycle with a relatively high amplitude, the asperity peaks are sheared, heating and softening of the faying surfaces are completed quickly and efficiently. Then by reducing the amplitude {{at the end of the}} weld cycle, shearing of the weld is reduced and weld damage is minimized resulting in relatively strong welds.;Very simple models based on frictional heating were able to predict power dissipation reasonably well. When these models were coupled with a one dimensional heat flow solution, the initial bondline temperatures were accurately predicted. However, the predicted temperatures diverged from the measured temperatures as a function of cycle time. It is believed that this deviation was due to the over simplified assumptions used to model the process. For example, the assumption that the process could be modeled with one dimensional heat flow in a semi-infinite body was seen to be false shortly after the weld process was initiated.;The study involving the placement of buffer sheets (copper or zinc) between the tool (horn) and the top part prior to the ultrasonic welding process reduced the tool/part adherence and the part marking. However, it was seen the use of buffer sheets slightly lowered the weld strength and this was especially seen for the thicker (3 -mm) parts and copper buffer sheets. It was also seen that zinc buffer sheets did not lower weld strength as much as the use of copper buffer sheets.;Also, it was concluded that the weld strength variance for those welds made with the time mode was smaller than that for the welds made in the height and energy mode...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a method of}} welding two thin sheets of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) with a heated pin, thus allowing construction of {{a relationship between the}} weld temperature and <b>weld</b> <b>strength.</b> Constructing a relationship between <b>weld</b> <b>strength</b> and temperature is necessary for modeling many welding processes, including laser transmission welding. An experimental approach to establishing this relationship is required because of the complex melting behavior of PVC. The designed experimental device uses a single heated pin to weld samples by using varying pressure and temper-ature for one second dwell time. An electro-mechani-cal loadframe pulled the welded samples until joint fail-ure occurred, thereby allowing determination of the <b>weld</b> <b>strength.</b> An experiment varying welding pin tem-perature and joining pressure found the temperature to be a highly significant determiner of <b>weld</b> <b>strength,</b> while the pressure was found to be not significant. A transient numerical heat transfer model was used to calculate the weld interface temperature for each pin temperature. The relationship established in this paper can be used to predict the <b>weld</b> <b>strength</b> from the tem-perature output from models of alternative weldin...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1999 Capacitor {{discharge}} welding (CDW) is a rapid solidification joining process {{under the}} influence of one-dimensional thermal gradients. Although CDW is useful for joining small parts and dissimilar metals, CD welded joints have a large variability in <b>weld</b> <b>strength.</b> CDW is not widely accepted {{because of a lack of}} automated process control. Studying the sources of variability in the CDW process can guide the automation of CDW. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to investigate sources of variability that affect <b>weld</b> <b>strength</b> and to generate a model to predict the <b>weld</b> <b>strength</b> variability in CDW. The source of variability was investigated by using screening experiments. Four different materials, stainless steel, Nitronic 50 Steel, copper, and low oxygen copper (C 101), were selected to represent various levels of thermal conductivity and absorbed gas content. Thermal conductivity, percentage of gas content absorbed, diameter, and welding time were treated as the independent variables while the dependent variables were the standard deviation of CD <b>weld</b> <b>strength</b> as a percentage of base material strength and the mean of CD <b>weld</b> <b>strength</b> as a percentage of base material strength. A screening experiment and a statistical analysis of the data were used to develop a predictive model of the <b>weld</b> <b>strength</b> variability in CDW. Electron photomicrographs of weld fracture surfaces and dynamic current and resistance curves for each welding cycle were used to support conclusions from the statistical analysis. Conclusions of this study are that thermal conductivity and absorbed gas content do have a significant influence on <b>weld</b> <b>strength</b> variability in CDW...|$|R
