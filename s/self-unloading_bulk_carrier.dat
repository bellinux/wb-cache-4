40|$|This {{study is}} {{fundamentally}} {{relevant to the}} development of a new enhanced Roller Track Gate (RTG) for the gravity type <b>Self-unloading</b> <b>Bulk</b> <b>Carriers</b> (SULS), called the Multi-functional Roller Track Gate (MRG). <b>Self-unloading</b> <b>Bulk</b> <b>Carriers</b> (SULS) are specialized types of dry <b>bulk</b> <b>carrier</b> vessels, principally because these ships discharge their cargoes without the assistance of external sources. In 1908, the first commercial vessel of these types started trading in the Great Lakes region of North America. Subsequent to the inception of SULS, the technology has developed mainly in the hull structure and onboard unloading systems. Due to the 1980 s GL shipping recession, SULS migrated internationally and are now trading worldwide. Eight gravity gates for SULS were investigated in detail prior to designing the MRG. These examinations of previous gates were primarily to address the inherent issues and develop a new gate that would correct the current problems, when discharging dry bulk cargo with the existing gravity gates. The newly designed gate is accompanied with special control system that improves the discharging operations of these type vessels. This gate resulted in being heavier when compared to the existing RTG. However, this study also addresses and mitigates the associated improvements in this new type gate that increases the ship’s lightweight with the possibility of increasing payload / deadweight. High tensile steel was introduced for the hull to compensate for the added gate weight. The steel weight reduction investigation resulted in greater weight than what was required for offsetting the gate weight. The additional weight savings allowed for greater cargo lift for the vessels examined. The economic case study confirmed that by replacing the present Roller Track Gate with the Multi-functional Roller Track Gate, the shipowners’ would benefit from improve discharging performance, less port turn around time and reduced manning cost.

5000|$|CSL had humble {{beginnings}} in Canada East in 1845, operating river boats on the Saint Lawrence River {{in general}} commerce. Subsequent {{growth over the}} years was tied to expansion of the canal system on the upper St. Lawrence River (the precursor to the Saint Lawrence Seaway), and to a new Welland Canal connecting to the upper Great Lakes. The year of 1913 saw the merger of CSL with Northern Navigation Companydefinition, the Richelieu and Ontario Navigation Company, and the Niagara Navigation Company, {{which resulted in the}} acquisition of several passenger vessels, including the vessels Chicora, Carona, Chippewa and Cayuga; built 1864(?), 1896, 1893 and 1907 respectively, with Cayuga being the last of them to be in service by 1936. She was sold in 1954 and scrapped by 1961. CSL had also acquired the new ships [...] (1909), Huronic (1901), and the ill-fated Noronic (1913). By 1924, CSL purchased its first <b>self-unloaded</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>carrier,</b> Collier, and also owned a shipyard in Collingwood, Ontario where CSL and competitor lakers were being built. CSL also came into ownership of one of Canada's largest shipyards, Davie Shipbuilding, in Lauzon, Quebec for a period in the 1960s-1970s and was at one time a major passenger line on the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{discusses}} the damage stability of generic <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers</b> following a collision. The damage stability is calculated and average survivability is estimated {{for the world}} fleet of <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers</b> {{using data from the}} HARDER project. Generic results have been compared to specific results using the HARDER approach. The average survivability given collision with water ingress of <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers</b> is also estimated based on records of recent <b>bulk</b> <b>carrier</b> accidents and it is demonstrated that the HARDER results are in general agreement with historic data. A simplified approach to estimate the conditional survivability using simple event trees is also presented. Furthermore, it is estimated that the introduction of double side skin on <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers</b> will enhance the survivability of <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers</b> with approximately 5 – 7. 5 %. Finally, the longitudinal strength on <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers</b> is considered in relation to collisions, and it is concluded that the longitudinal strength is dimensioned by other flooding conditions already included in the rules...|$|R

50|$|CSL saw {{operations}} increase exponentially in {{the late}} 1950s {{with the opening of}} the expanded Saint Lawrence Seaway and the timely discovery and exploitation of some of the world's largest iron ore deposits on the Labrador Peninsula in Labrador City, Schefferville, and Mont Wright. Ore was moved to Sept-Îles and Port-Cartier by the Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway and Cartier Railway respectively, where it was then loaded into bulk carriers for transfer to Canadian and U.S. steel mills on the Great Lakes. CSL exploited this traffic by continually refining its <b>self-unloading</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>carrier</b> designs, coupled with improvements in stevedoring at various ports to arrive at a minimal number of human operators required.|$|E

50|$|A <b>bulk</b> <b>carrier</b> is an {{ocean-going vessel}} used to {{transport}} bulk cargo {{items such as}} iron ore, bauxite, coal, cement, grain and similar cargo. <b>Bulk</b> <b>carriers</b> can be recognized by large box-like hatches on deck, designed to slide outboard or fold fore-and-aft to enable access for loading or discharging cargo. The dimensions of <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers</b> are often determined by the ports and sea routes {{that they need to}} serve, and by the maximum width of the Panama Canal. Most lakes are too small to accommodate <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers,</b> but a large fleet of lake freighters has been plying the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway of North America for over a century.|$|R
