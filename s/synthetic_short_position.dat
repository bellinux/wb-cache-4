40|$|This paper {{provides}} a fuller {{characterization of the}} analytical upper bounds for American options than has been available to date. We establish properties required of analytical upper bounds without any direct reliance on the exercise boundary. A class of generalized European claims on the same underlying asset is then proposed as upper bounds. This set contains the existing closed form bounds of Margrabe (1978) and Chen and Yeh (2002) as special cases and allows randomization of the maturity payoff. Due to the European nature of the bounds, across-strike arbitrage conditions on option prices seem to carry over to the bounds. Among other things, European option spreads {{may be viewed as}} ratio positions on the early exercise option. To tighten the upper bound, we propose a quasi-bound that holds as an upper bound for most situations of interest and seems to offer considerable improvement over the currently available closed form bounds. As an approximation, the discounted value of Chen and Yeh’s (2001) bound holds some promise. We also discuss implications for parametric and nonparametric empirical option pricing. Sample option quotes for the European (XEO) and the American (OEX) options on the S&P 100 Index appear well behaved with respect to the upper bound properties but the bid-ask spreads are too wide to permit a <b>synthetic</b> <b>short</b> <b>position</b> in the early exercise option...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three empirical studies about the informational content of options trading on subsequent equity returns and around major corporate events, such as mergers and acquisitions, and bankruptcies. The first chapter examines the informational content of options trading on acquirer announcement returns. I show that implied volatility spread predicts positively on the cumulative abnormal return (CAR), and implied volatility skew predicts negatively on the CAR. The predictability is much stronger around actual merger and acquisition (M&A) announcement days, compared with pseudo-event days. The prediction is weaker if pre-M&A stock price has incorporated part of the information, but stronger if acquirer’s options trading is more liquid. Finally, I find that higher relative trading volume of options to stock predicts higher absolute CARs. The relation also exists among the target firms. In the second chapter, I reassess the presence of pre- bankruptcy-filing informed and insider trades by examining the information content of options trading before bankruptcy announcements. I find that bankruptcy filing returns are not significantly related to pre-filing insider stock trading. However, filing returns are significantly negatively related to pre-filing insider and informed options trading. The informational content of options trading reduces with options illiquidity {{and the amount of}} information impounded into pre-filing stock prices. In the third chapter, I use data on signed option volume to study which components of option volume predict returns and resolve the apparent inconsistency in the literature. I find no evidence that trades related to <b>synthetic</b> <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> in the underlying stocks contain more information than trades related to synthetic long positions. Purchases of calls that open new positions are the strongest predictor of returns, followed by call sales that close out existing purchased call positions. The signed O/S measures also predict announcement returns for both earnings announcements and unscheduled corporate events. Overall the results indicate that the role of options in providing embedded leverage is the most important channel why options trading predict stock returns. published_or_final_versionEconomics and FinanceDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
2500|$|An {{investor}} or speculator may “buy protection” {{to hedge}} {{the risk of}} default on a bond or other debt instrument, regardless of whether such investor or speculator holds an interest in or bears any risk of loss relating to such bond or debt instrument. In this way, a CDS is similar to credit insurance, although CDS {{are not subject to}} regulations governing traditional insurance. Also, investors can buy and sell protection without owning debt of the reference entity. These [...] "naked credit default swaps" [...] allow traders to speculate on the creditworthiness of reference entities. CDSs can be used to create <b>synthetic</b> long and <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> in the reference entity. [...] Naked CDS constitute most of the market in CDS. [...] In addition, CDSs can also be used in capital structure arbitrage.|$|R

So, are we unable to create this position? Well, investors can resort to options.

So, if we wanted {{the equivalent of a}} <b>short</b> <b>position</b> in a stock: -S = -C - K/(1 +r) ^t + P Thus, to create a <b>synthetic</b> <b>short,</b> we would sell a call, short a t-bill (or borrow present value of exercise price) and buy a put.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} 2011 European short sale ban on financial stocks {{proved to be}} successful or had {{a negative impact on}} financial markets. We explicitly take an options market perspective and focus on market participants’ changes in beliefs and expectations. During the ban, <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> in banned stocks decreased, whereas they increased for non-banned stocks. Our results indicate that the ban increased implied jump risk levels, thereby negatively impacting the banned financial stocks. However, we also observe that after the announcement of the ban, financial contagion risk actually dropped for banned stocks. Instead of a substitution effect between regular <b>short</b> selling and <b>synthetic</b> <b>shorting</b> through single stock puts, we observe a migration out of single stock puts into the EuroStoxx 50 index options market. We conclude that this type of migration diversified selling pressure initially concentrated in financial stocks across a larger share of the stock market, thereby reducing systemic risks and enhancing overall financial stability...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyses {{the nature}} (capital or revenue) {{of the proceeds}} arising {{from the use of}} <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> in South African hedge fund fundamental paired trades. Hedge funds, which typically avail themselves of an array of alternative investment strategies such as short selling in addition to the traditional asset classes, were recently brought into the South African investment regulatory net. This was achieved by classifying regulated hedge funds as a separate category of collective investment scheme in terms of the CISCA. This categorisation brought regulated hedge funds into the ambit of section 25 BA of the Income Tax Act which carries an important distinction between amounts of a capital nature and amounts of a revenue nature. Given that hedge funds may use <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> for both profit-seeking and risk-mitigation purposes, the resulting proceeds from short sales could be capital or revenue in nature from a tax perspective based on the surrounding facts of the trade. The onus of discharging the proof that the proceeds resulting from a short sale are capital in nature is significant. The South African case law emphasises the importance of applying the various principles to the specific facts of the case. The importance of the dominant intention of the trade is highlighted, given the potentially competing purposes of profit-seeking and risk-mitigation present. Factors that should be analysed in such a scenario include the overall portfolio positioning, the size of the long and <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> relative to each other, the degree of specificity of the risk that the <b>short</b> <b>position</b> purports to hedge against, the manner of re-investment of the short sale proceeds, the level of trading activity in the hedge fund, the level of <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> in the hedge fund, the absolute sizes of the long and <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> {{in the context of the}} overall portfolio, the exposure of the hedge fund to the long position after the close out of the <b>short</b> <b>position,</b> the manner of close out of the <b>short</b> <b>position</b> and the holding period of the <b>short</b> <b>position.</b> While the analysis reveals factors that may be indicative of capital treatment, the classification of short sale proceeds as capital or revenue in nature remains a challenging task to undertake due to the potentially wide variety of facts and circumstances and the potential for undesirable consequences should an incorrect classification be made. Consequently, improved clarity through the provision of de jure guidance as to the nature of short sale proceeds would be welcome...|$|R

40|$|Recently many {{mutual funds}} have created hedge fund-like {{products}} for marketing to retail investors. This study empirically examines the value added for investors during the 2007 financial crisis from hedge fund-like mutual funds, including 130 / 30, market neutral, and long/short equity funds. Based {{on the information}} ratio, market neutral and long/short equity funds have higher risk-adjusted returns than a passive index fund. However, hedge fund-like mutual funds in general add no value for investors, based on either unconditional or conditional four-factor alphas, even in a down market. While <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> taken by these funds do generate alpha, the gain from <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> is not sufficiently large to offset the loss from long positions.
