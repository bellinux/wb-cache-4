40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, the demand for {{evidence-based}} family and social policies has increased dramatically. This means that policy-makers need access to evidence-based information about social policy solutions. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the information needs of state legislative staff concerning social problems. A 2008 - 09 Internet study gathered data from 85 Massachusetts legislative <b>staffers.</b> The <b>staffers</b> were predominantly white, well-educated, worked in Democratic offices, and had worked as <b>staffers</b> for an average of 5. 5 years. Analyses indicate that <b>staffers</b> are most concerned about issues pertaining to healthcare costs, education, housing issues, financial stability for families, and the environment. Ninety-six percent of <b>staffers</b> reported that they would be interested/very interested in a website designed specifically for Massachusetts <b>staffers.</b> The results have implications for how researchers can participate in the making of evidence-based social policies and better meet the needs of legislative staff...|$|R

5|$|Despite the polls, Douglas was {{confident}} that the Democratic registration edge would lead her to victory, {{so much so that}} she offered a Roosevelt <b>staffer</b> a job in her senatorial office. On election day, November 7, 1950, Nixon defeated Douglas by 59percent to 41. Of California's 58counties, Douglas won only five, all in Northern California and with relatively small populations; Nixon won every urban area. Although Warren defeated Roosevelt by an even larger margin, Nixon won by the greatest number of votes of any 1950 Senate candidate. Douglas, in her concession speech, declined to congratulate Nixon. Marcantonio was also defeated in his New York district.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Kenneth (Jack McBrayer) {{falls for}} a new <b>staffer,</b> a blind woman named Jennifer (Maria Thayer). Kenneth cannot bring himself to ask Jennifer out, so Tracy (Tracy Morgan) decides to help him. On their date, at the 30 Rock studios, Kenneth and Jennifer are joined by Tracy—who does all the talking. Jennifer {{believes}} Kenneth is black, but Kenneth reveals he is white and expresses his feeling for her, and admits to her that Tracy was doing all the talking. Jennifer tells him she does not mind of what has happened. However, after feeling Kenneth's face and comparing it to her own, she leaves, horrified at his appearance.|$|E
5|$|The Firefight game mode was a late {{addition}} to the game. <b>Staffer</b> Tim Williams built a prototype shortly after Halo 3 shipped, placing the player in {{a portion of a}} Halo 3 campaign map and fighting enemies. When development commenced on ODST, William's concept was adopted for the game and refined. Designer Lars Bakken described one advantage of the game mode as providing a more friendly multiplayer environment than hardcore players online. The designers reused the campaign scoring and medal system from Halo 3 to add a competitive edge.|$|E
5000|$|Newsweek <b>staffers</b> reacted ambivalently to the merger.

5|$|The Fédération Centrafricaine de Football, the CAR's {{national}} football association, {{was founded in}} 1961 and became a FIFA affiliate in 1964. In the CAR, there is no national association <b>staffer</b> dedicated to women's football and no women on the board or in the executive committee. With assistance from FIFA, the federation developed a women's programme starting in 2000. A national competition and school competition were later introduced. Football {{is one of the}} most popular women's sports in the CAR. There were about 200 registered youth players in the country and 200 registered senior players as of 2006. There are 80 club-level teams with women on them, 20 of which are exclusively for women.|$|E
5|$|A Kansas native, Isenhour {{attended}} the University of Kansas. She began her political {{career as a}} <b>staffer</b> in the Kansas House of Representatives.

From 1991 to 1995, Isenhour served as Chief of Staff to House Minority Leader Tom Sawyer, where she worked with Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike to advance legislation, served as a liaison between Sawyer and other officials, and worked with members of leadership and committees to develop legislative strategies and build coalitions. In 1992, Isenhour was the director of the Democratic Party's Kansas Coordinated Campaign for legislative races, both in the state House and Senate. Those races included more than three dozen candidates by July 1992.|$|E

From 1985 to 1994, he was legislative director for U.S. Representative Steny Hoyer, and associate <b>staffer</b> on the House Appropriations Committee. Berry assisted Hoyer on employment issues of the federal government, and {{played a leading role}} in negotiations that led to the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990, which established the locality pay system. From 1994 to 1995, Berry served as Deputy Assistant Secretary and acting Assistant Secretary for Law Enforcement in the U.S. Treasury Department. From 1995 to 1997, Berry worked as director of government relations and as senior policy advisor at the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
25|$|In August 2014, the Cato Institute {{suggested}} that Congressional <b>staffers</b> should spend spare time editing Wikipedia. A panel {{hosted by the}} institute endorsed the idea so that congressional <b>staffers</b> could use their time to write neutral and informative articles about proposed legislation to better educate the public. Experts on the panel considered the two main obstacles to doing this as being skepticism towards Wikipedia {{and the history of}} biased editing from Congressional <b>staffers.</b> The Cato Institute suggested one way to overcome these issues would be for the <b>staffers</b> to create user accounts and user profile pages disclosing their connections with Congress.|$|R
50|$|The {{business}} department {{manages the}} finances {{of the magazine}} and secures funding. Much of a <b>staffer's</b> job involves securing advertisements in the magazine, while the department heads oversee the <b>staffers</b> and advise the editor-in-chief.|$|R
50|$|In February 2015, eight senior <b>staffers</b> and {{a number}} of other paid {{employees}} left NOI due to frustrations over fundraising and the management style of Executive Director Ethan Roeder.

On October 9, 2015, NOI announced that it was closing shop and handing over certain aspects of its work to Wellstone Action.|$|R
5|$|Former Georgetown University {{basketball}} coach John Thompson had originally booked a ticket on Flight 77. As {{he would tell}} the story {{many times in the}} following years, including a September 12, 2011 interview on Jim Rome's radio show, he had been scheduled to appear on that show on September 12, 2001. Thompson was planning to be in Las Vegas for a friend's birthday on September 13, and initially insisted on traveling to Rome's Los Angeles studio on the 11th. However, this did not work for the show, which wanted him to travel {{on the day of the}} show. After a Rome <b>staffer</b> personally assured Thompson that he would be able to travel from Los Angeles to Las Vegas immediately after the show, Thompson changed his travel plans. He felt the impact from the crash at his home near the Pentagon.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Lu left Sidley Austin {{and took}} his first job in the {{political}} arena as deputy chief counsel for Representative Henry Waxman and the Democratic staff of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee of the House of Representatives. Phil Schiliro, Waxman's chief of staff, had a large part in the decision to hire Lu; the two would work together again later on the Obama administration; Lu later said he considers Schiliro and Pete Rouse, another future White House <b>staffer,</b> among his most influential mentors. During his tenure with the Government Reform Committee, Lu conducted several high-profile investigations, including investigations into campaign fundraising during the 1996 presidential election, the collapse of Enron, and substandard nursing home conditions. Lu also served as special adviser for communications to Senator John Kerry during the 2004 presidential election. One of his primary duties there was coordinating the activities of families of September 11 attack victims supporting the Kerry campaign.|$|E
5|$|In September and October 2008, by-elections in the Port Macquarie area at both {{federal and}} state level gave a new forum {{to some of the}} players in the controversy. When the member for the federal seat of Lyne, Mark Vaile, retired from {{politics}} on 30 July 2008, Oakeshott and Drew, the latter standing as the endorsed National Party candidate, emerged as the major candidates in the resulting by-election on 6 September. With the Glasshouse as a major issue, Oakeshott won 63.80% of the primary vote to Drew's 22.88%, with a further 10.07% coming to Oakeshott via preferences. In Oakeshott's old state seat of Port Macquarie, former Councillors Jamie Harrison and Lisa Intemann ran as independents, between them attracting 15.8% of the vote, whilst former Oakeshott <b>staffer</b> Peter Besseling {{went on to win the}} election against the endorsed National candidate.|$|E

5|$|Agnew's pride {{had been}} stung by the {{negative}} {{news coverage of}} him during the campaign, and he sought to bolster his reputation by assiduous performance of his duties. It had become usual {{for the vice president}} to preside over the Senate only if he might be needed to break a tie, but Agnew opened every session for the first two months of his term, and spent more time presiding, in his first year, than any vice president since Alben Barkley, who held that role under Harry S. Truman. The first postwar vice president not to have been a senator, he took lessons in Senate procedures from the parliamentarian and from a Republican committee <b>staffer.</b> He lunched with small groups of senators, and was initially successful in building good relations. Although silenced on foreign policy matters, he attended White House staff meetings and spoke on urban affairs; when Nixon was present, he often presented the perspective of the governors. Agnew earned praise from the other members when he presided over a meeting of the White House Domestic Council in Nixon's absence but, like Nixon during Eisenhower's illnesses, did not sit in the president's chair. Nevertheless, many of the commission assignments Nixon gave Agnew were sinecures, with the vice president only formally the head.|$|E
5|$|In June 1976, Gravel was {{the focus}} of a federal {{investigation}} into allegations that he was involved in a sex-for-vote arrangement. Congressional staff clerk Elizabeth Ray (who was already the subject of a sex scandal that led to the downfall of Representative Wayne Hays) stated that in August 1972, she had sex with Gravel aboard a houseboat on the Potomac River, under the instruction of Representative Kenneth J. Gray, her boss at the time. Gray allegedly wanted to secure Gravel's support for further funding for construction of the National Visitor Center in Washington, a troubled project that was under the jurisdiction of subcommittees that both members chaired. Another Congressional <b>staffer</b> said she witnessed the boat encounter, but Gravel said {{at the time that he}} had never met either of the women. Both Gravel and Gray strongly denied that they had made any arrangement regarding legislation, and neither was ever charged with any wrongdoing. Decades later, Gravel wrote that he had indeed had sex with Ray, but had not changed any votes because of it.|$|E
5|$|With no presidential ambitions left, Kennedy {{formed a}} good {{relationship}} with Democratic President Bill Clinton upon the latter taking office in 1993, despite his having initially backed former fellow Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas in the 1992 Democratic presidential primaries. Kennedy floor-managed successful passage of Clinton's National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 that created the AmeriCorps program, and despite reservations supported the president on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). On the issue Kennedy cared most about, national health insurance, he supported but was not much involved in formation of the Clinton health care plan, which was run by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and others. It failed badly and damaged the prospects for such legislation for years to come. In 1994, Kennedy's strong recommendation of his former Judiciary Committee <b>staffer</b> Stephen Breyer played a role in Clinton appointing Breyer to the U.S. Supreme Court. During 1994 Kennedy became the first senator with a home page on the World Wide Web; the product of an effort with the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, it helped counter the image of Kennedy as old and out of touch.|$|E
