25|$|Ioannis Tsoukalas of <b>Stockholm</b> <b>University</b> has {{hypothesized}} that REM sleep is an evolutionary transformation of a well-known defensive mechanism, the tonic immobility reflex. This reflex, {{also known as}} animal hypnosis or death feigning, functions as {{the last line of}} defense against an attacking predator and consists of the total immobilization of the animal so that it appears dead. Tsoukalas argues that the neurophysiology and phenomenology of this reaction shows striking similarities to REM sleep; for example, both reactions exhibit brainstem control, paralysis, hypocampal theta rhythm, and thermoregulatory changes.|$|E

25|$|Anna Christensen {{was born}} in 1936 in Tumba, Sweden. She studied law at <b>Stockholm</b> <b>University</b> and carried out her studies in Uppsala where she, in 1970, {{successfully}} defended her dissertation in Commercial Law; Studies in the Law of Sale of Goods (Studier i Köprätt). Her doctoral thesis dealt {{with some of the}} problems concerning the right to treat a contract as of sale of goods as discharged – the right of rescission – in various situations that may rise in the course of performance. Focus was put on those special considerations relevant to the right of rescission which depended on how far performance had proceeded when the question of rescission came up. Five years later, in 1975, Anna Christensen was appointed Professor in Private Law at the Faculty of Law at Lund University.|$|E
25|$|In {{the short}} {{time-frame}} of their rapid expansion, the Institutes {{have been the}} subject of much controversy. Criticisms of the Institutes have included practical concerns about ﬁnance, academic viability, legal issues, and relations with the Chinese partner university, as well as ideological concerns about improper inﬂuence over teaching and research, industrial and military espionage, surveillance of Chinese abroad, and undermining Taiwanese inﬂuence. There has also been organized opposition to the establishment of a Confucius Institute at University of Melbourne, University of Manitoba, <b>Stockholm</b> <b>University,</b> University of Chicago and many others. More significantly, some universities that hosted Confucius Institutes decided to terminate their contracts. These include Japan's Osaka Sangyo University in 2010; Canada's McMaster University and Université de Sherbrooke, and France's University of Lyon in 2013; the University of Chicago, Pennsylvania State University, and the Toronto District School Board in 2014. and the German Stuttgart Media University and University of Hohenheim in 2015.|$|E
25|$|Sharaf {{played a}} minor but {{important}} part in the drama that unfolded in Cairo surrounding the initial consideration of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences of Naguib Mahfouz for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1982. Sharaf was quietly and unofficially approached in 1981 by Dr. Attia Amer, Professor of Arabic Literature at <b>Stockholm</b> <b>University,</b> with a request to forward translations of Mahfouz's work for further study and evaluation by the Swedish Academy. Sharaf acted on the request, only to be rebuffed by Cairo and presented with an alternative candidate, which the Academy politely declined as all nominations were its sole prerogative and mandate and did not yield to government pressure. Sharaf would express disappointment at Cairo’s incomprehensible stance on the issue, believing {{it would have made}} an enormous difference to the cause of Arabic literature, to Egypt, to him as ambassador, and naturally to Mahfouz, had the latter been nominated and won the prize, joining the list of Nobel Laureates for that year.|$|E
