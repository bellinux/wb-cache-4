5|$|In Tan Liang Joo John, Justice Judith Prakash {{stated that}} this was not a closed list, and that the court is {{entitled}} to take into account all the circumstances of the case which in its view go towards showing bad faith. She also noted that English authorities impose another limit on the content of criticism – that the acts or words in question must neither impute improper motives to nor impugn the integrity, propriety and impartiality of judges or the courts. However, <b>she</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> follow these authorities and averred that to impose such a limit would be unnecessary and potentially over-restrictive of legitimate criticism.|$|E
5|$|On December 18, 2008, {{sources close}} to the Obama {{transition}} team identified Solis as the President-elect's choice for U.S. Secretary of Labor, the last cabinet position yet to be filled. The selection earned praise from the AFL-CIO and other labor organizations, but was not well received by business groups and the anti-union group Center for Union Facts. The official announcement was made by Obama on December 19. Solis's successor was chosen in a special election in California's 32nd congressional district; <b>she</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> endorse a candidate in the primary (from which her past mentee Judy Chu emerged on top and eventually won the general election).|$|E

5|$|When the 2013 festival {{began in}} Park City, Utah, the secrecy {{about the movie}} continued. The festival's website only {{identified}} the setting as a theme park. Nan Chalat-Noaker, critic for the Park Record, recalls that the festival and even the film's publicist were unwilling to share further details about the film, but strongly urged critics to see it. In her review, <b>she</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> identify {{the setting of the}} film by name, although she dropped broad hints, out of fear it would alert Disney's lawyers. The premiere, on the festival's first night, was not fully attended; when word got out to the attendees, all the other shows were effectively sold out.|$|E
5|$|During {{a cabinet}} meeting {{towards the end}} of April, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi asked Manekshaw if he was {{prepared}} {{to go to war with}} Pakistan. In response, Manekshaw told her most of his armoured and infantry divisions were deployed elsewhere, only 12 of his tanks were combat-ready, and they would be competing for rail carriages with the grain harvest at that point of time. He also pointed out the Himalayan passes would soon open up, with the forthcoming monsoon in East Pakistan, which would result in heavy flooding. When Gandhi asked the cabinet to leave the room and Manekshaw to stay, he offered to resign. <b>She</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> accept it, but sought his advice. He then said he could guarantee victory if she would allow him to prepare for the conflict on his terms, and set a date for it, and Gandhi agreed.|$|E

50|$|Elizabeth Hurley was to reprise as Vanessa but <b>she</b> <b>declined</b> due <b>to</b> {{scheduling}} conflicts.|$|R
60|$|The {{reasons for}} this seemed to be, first, that Campbell states {{that he did not}} ask Lady Byron's leave, and that she did not {{authorise}} him to defend her; and, second, that, having asked some explanations from her, he prints a note in which <b>she</b> <b>declines</b> <b>to</b> give any.|$|R

[...] The revelation of Cecily's wealth soon dispels Lady Bracknell's initial doubts over the young lady's suitability, but any engagement is forbidden by her guardian Jack: he will consent only if Lady Bracknell agrees to his own union with Gwendolen—something <b>she</b> <b>declines</b> <b>to</b> do.|$|R

25|$|On September 6, 2009, Tequila was {{allegedly}} choked and restrained by former boyfriend Shawne Merriman, who was later arrested.

25|$|The {{majority}} opinion in Barnette {{is considered one}} of the Court's greatest and most sweeping statements about the fundamental freedoms established by the Bill of Rights.

Verner (1963), for example, the Court upheld a Seventh-day Adventist's claim to unemployment benefits even though <b>she</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> make herself available to work on Saturday (her Sabbath) as the law required. In Wisconsin v. Yoder (1972), the Court upheld the right of Amish parents not to send their children to public schools past the eighth grade.|$|E

Mrs Gilroy could only decline to give evidence because the events she would speak to took place before section 86 of the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010 came into force. This act amended the law such that spouses and civil partners of an accused person in Scotland, are competent and compellable witnesses for the prosecution.|$|E
