A <b>symmetric</b> <b>input–output</b> <b>table</b> (SIOT) converts SUTs into one single matrix that can either be a product-by-product or industry-by-industry framework. Hence, the SUT framework {{has the advantage of}} portraying differentiated industries and products, which makes possible the allocation of several products (such as co-products and by-products) to any one industry. The usefulness of this approach is enhanced if the product-level detail in the SUT is higher than the number of industry sectors. This is the case if additional original data from statistical offices are available or if additional information (e.g., specific process data) is used to disaggregate product sectors.|$|R

This study provides an exhaustive analysis of the various interrelations which characterize the flow structure of production activities within the Maltese economy, as well as provides a framework in which it is possible to assess the behaviour, in terms of transactions and transfers, of all the economic agents which characterize the Maltese economic system. This thesis presents the construction of the first <b>symmetric</b> <b>input-output</b> for the Maltese economy, for the year 2000 which has a high level of sectoral disaggregation and which also conforms to both European system of accounts guidelines published in 1995 and the Eurostat input-output methodological guidelines. The constructed <b>symmetric</b> <b>input-output</b> <b>table</b> was subsequently employed for the compilation, via the construction of a set of income expenditure accounts, of the first fully articulated social accounting matrix for Malta for the year 2000. Via the application of input-output and social accounting matrix based linkages analysis a detailed study is carried out in order to assess the underlying inter-industry relations which characterize the flow structure of the Maltese economy. The results obtained also provide policy makers with a broad range of analytically derived estimates with which to evaluate the strategic importance of each industry {{within the context of the}} national economy...|$|R

We considered the platform of Triple-bottom-line (TBL) as a theoretical starting-point of the concept of sustainable development. For the purposes of compiling a relevant procedure we proposed to use the Leontief input–output model based on the <b>symmetric</b> <b>input–output</b> <b>table</b> (SIOT). The results of study has shown five key indicators, which describe economic, social and environmental phenomena, via interaction of which the value added of tourism comes to be created: the total value added created by tourism, total employment in tourism, cost savings of potential unemployment, quality of life of residents generated by tourism and environmental infrastructure of tourism. As a key indicator of economic effects of tourism, there was identified value added created by tourism, or the total value added created by tourism calculated to one resident. This indicator is constructed so that it captured not only direct but also indirect and induced effects of tourism via quantification of multiplier effects. The construction of aggregate indicators for the social and environmental areas is selected so that relevant impacts of tourism may be captured, and subsequently quantified and reflected into the final effect of tourism – into its societal value...|$|R
40|$|The {{shift towards}} a service-based {{industry}} has been recognised in the mid-term review of the European Commission’s industrial policy (European Commission, 2007). The term services-based industry as such has become a key word. The objective {{of this paper is}} to explore whether manufacturing industries in the new EU member states (NMS) Czech Republic, Hungary. Slovakia, Slovenia and Poland are service-based industries or have emerged as such over the last twenty years. Austria will serve as a reference country and development trends in the NMS will be compared to it. METHODOLOGY: The service-based industry is characterized by increasing use of services inputs and increasing production of services output, mainly related to industrial goods (Ecorys, 2008). By using input-output statistics, consisting of supply and use tables and <b>symmetric</b> <b>input-output</b> <b>tables,</b> these characteristics can be traced in an appropriate way. Input-output data from EUROSTAT for the years 1995, 2000 and 2005 for the NMS will be analysed and compared to those of Austria. The following measures will be computed: the share of service production in the output of manufacturing based on supply tables; the use of market services in the input structure of manufacturing based on use tables and a simple linkage index (Rasmussen index, backward linkages for manufacturing and forward linkages for market services) based on <b>symmetric</b> <b>input-output</b> <b>tables...</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{follows the}} increasing {{extent of the}} European Union's intervention into rural areas. The main objective of the dissertation is to analyse and evaluate the impacts of measures supporting job creation, within the Rural Development Programme of the Czech Republic for 2007 [...] 2013, on regional production, income and employment in the Vysočina region. Specifically, it concerns the measures under Axis 3 Pillar 2 of the EU Common Agricultural Policy supporting diversification into non-agricultural activities, micro-businesses and tourism development. The sub-objective is to analyse the coefficients and multipliers, which would identify the sectors with the greatest potential for further development in terms of production, income and employment in the Vysočina region. Within the main objective three alternatives impacts that arise {{when there is a}} change of the final demand for production of a given industry are analysed and these can be measured by changes in production, income or employment. Two formulated hypotheses are analysed in detail In the individual chapters the dissertation is focused on the theoretical aspects of rural development dealing with the aspects of rural development policy implementation, describing the models and empirical analysis of the impact of measures supporting rural economic development. It also describes the characteristics of the Vysočina region, offering a methodology and construction of a regional <b>input-output</b> <b>table</b> and the <b>input-output</b> model for the Vysočina region, and finally, it includes a methodology and application of the impact analysis for the region. In order to achieve the main objective Leontief's structural input-output analysis is used (Leontief, 1966). The regional short-term macroeconomic input-output model built on the example of the Vysočina region serves as a tool for the analysis. A part of the analysis is the identification of factors that influence the size of the impact found. To perform the impact analysis the author constructed a regional <b>input-output</b> <b>table</b> for the Vysočina region. The regionalization of the national commodity <b>symmetric</b> <b>input-output</b> <b>table</b> (CZSO, 2010 f) is performed using the GRIT method (Jensen et al., 1979). The selected method is suitable for assessing the short-term impact of political measures, where the found effects can be attributed exclusively to the political measures observed. All the restrictions typical of input-output analysis have been taken into account. The scientific contribution of the dissertation is the creation of a regional macroeconomic input-output model for the Vysočina region based on Leontief's input - output analysis, and its use to determine the impact of the realised funds on the monitored measures of production, income and employment in the Vysočina region. The other scientific contribution is the construction of a regional <b>input-output</b> <b>table</b> for the Vysočina region. This serves as a data source for the input-output analysis since regional <b>input-output</b> <b>tables</b> are not available in the Czech Republic...|$|R

40|$|Using {{input-output}} analysis, {{this research}} project investigates {{the role of}} services in the Central European new EU member states (NMS) – the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia – and compares it to that in Austria. The role of services includes not only {{their position in the}} production structure per se but also their increasing importance as an intermediate input for manufacturing and other services. As services were underdeveloped under the former system in the new EU member states, it is interesting to look at their features and changes over time. The analysis is based on Eurostat supply and use tables and done at the 2 -digit level (NACE rev. 1 /CPA) for the years 1995, 2000 and 2005 (in nominal values only). For certain parts of the project <b>symmetric</b> industry-by-industry <b>input-output</b> <b>tables</b> were constructed. The main findings are the following a strong focus on manufacturing output, value added and intermediates still prevails on average in the NMS, while services are underrepresented. Between 1995 and 2005, structural change towards services took place in the NMS both on the production and use side. However, major structural differences still exist in comparison to Austria, which shows higher dynamics than the NMS and {{turns out to be a}} moving target. In a key sector analysis, service industries were classified as ‘key’ industries, depicting strong forward and backward linkages. Over time, especially backward linkages have grown. The expected ‘gap’ of knowledge-intensive business services vis-à-vis Austria at the beginning of the period was not revealed by the data for the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovenia. Until 2005, Austria showed a pronounced shift towards ‘other business services’ and overtook the NMS in some respects. new member states, input-output analysis, linkages, key-sector analysis, services, knowledge-intensive business services...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} and evaluates {{a way of}} making product-to-product tables from Use and Make matrices that are of immediate relevance to any statistical office that makes input-output tables. Two ways of making a product-to-product table are in common practice: one based on the product-technology assumption and the other on the industry-technology assumption. The industry-technology assumption is recognized as highly implausible but is often used because the product-technology assumption frequently leads to small negative flows which make no economic sense. This paper shows how a slight adjustment in the product-technology assumption leads to an algorithm that is certain to avoid negative flows yet keeps close to the spirit of the product-technology idea.

This approach can also be used for more detailed tables, e. g. quarterly and regional tables. However, the regular RAS method does not ensure that the sums of quarterly/regional tables are equal to the annual/national table. For this problem we propose multidimensional RAS method which besides input and output totals also ensures quarterly or regional totals. Our analysis of quarterly and regional input-output structure shows that the quarterly/regional totals condition should not be omitted and the multidimensional RAS method produces more precise estimations than the regular RAS method.

METI ([2005]) applied this analytical framework to their research using the 2000 Japan–US International <b>Input–Output</b> <b>Table.</b> Yamada ([2004]) produced a comparative analysis of the overseas production activities of Japanese subsidiaries in the US and Asia, using the 1995 and 2000 IDE Asia International <b>Input–Output</b> <b>Tables.</b> Teng and Fang ([2008]) applied a somewhat similar analytical framework to Japan–China relations, using 1995 and 2000 Japan–China International <b>Input–Output</b> <b>Tables</b> which were estimated by them. This paper does the same using the following two characteristics: to apply the latest economic structures of the 2007 Japan–China International <b>Input–Output</b> <b>Table,</b> {{and to use the}} microdata of the Basic Survey of Overseas Business Activities, METI, Japan. 2 [...]...|$|R

These data cover 35 industrial sectors and 40 countries and region (Tables  4, 5 in the Appendix) {{and focus on the}} period of 1995 – 2011. For this study, the nominal World <b>Input–Output</b> <b>Tables</b> for 1995 – 2009 were converted into deflated World <b>Input–Output</b> <b>Tables</b> based on 2009 prices using the double deflation method (United Nations 1999). The deflators were obtained from the output prices of the nominal World <b>Input–Output</b> <b>Tables</b> and of the real World <b>Input–Output</b> <b>Tables</b> in previous year’s prices.|$|R
40|$|International <b>input-output</b> <b>tables</b> {{are among}} the most useful tools for {{economic}} analysis. Since these tables provide detailed information about international production networks, they have recently attracted considerable attention in research on spatial economics, global value chains, and issues relating to trade in value-added. The Institute of Developing Economies at the Japan External Trade Organization (IDE-JETRO) has more than 40 years of experience in the construction and analysis of international <b>input-output</b> <b>tables.</b> This paper explains the development of IDE-JETRO’s multi-regional input-output projects including the construction of the Asian International <b>Input-Output</b> <b>table</b> and the Transnational Interregional <b>Input-Output</b> <b>table</b> between China and Japan. To help users understand the features of the tables, this paper also gives examples of their application...|$|R
