60|$|And <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> so pitiful that I {{goes up to}} her {{and puts}} my arm round her and pats her on the back.|$|E
6000|$|... "She is horribly like him, and, Geoffrey, it is foolish of me, but {{sometimes}} <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with his eyes. It makes me shiver." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> suspiciously, as authors {{usually do}} when asked such a question. They are not certain {{whether you are}} really sympathetic. However, she reads honesty in my eyes.|$|E
60|$|The smile left my mother's face. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> attentively.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{first time}} I ever saw her, driving her geese {{down the hill}} on the day I came to Four Winds, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with the same expression," [...] persisted Anne. [...] "I felt it, {{even in the midst}} of my admiration of her beauty. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> resentfully--she did, indeed, Captain Jim." ...|$|R
60|$|A little forced smile parted her lips. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> kindly.|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and {{she wants}} to stay with me," [...] he went on monotonously. [...] "She's got such a will, it seems as if she would never go--never!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a pale, cold blue eye, {{and shouts}} {{into the dark}} for somebody. Then she {{advances}} into the passage and looks us up and down, the q-b and me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{believe that}} she hates me too. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> as though I were {{something}} unpleasant, as though she wished me dead. I will not go to her, Arnold. Say that I shall not." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> politely, {{having said}} what she {{intended}} to say.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> undecidedly, {{not quite}} {{knowing how to}} take me.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> <b>She</b> {{always did}} have the most {{wonderful}} eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "She never says them, sir. She allus {{pretends to}} be feeling stronger. But I knows what is in her mind when I am leaving {{the house in the}} morning, for then <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> from her bed, and I looks at her from the door--oh, my God, sir!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear friend," [...] she murmured, [...] "I {{think that}} it is my heart only which will reward you--my great, great gratitude. I am afraid of Lady Delahaye, Arnold. There are things in her eyes when <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> which make me shiver. Do not let us go there again, please!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{sometimes}} feel that I'm making none. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> half amused and half astonished when I express my opinions; I {{have to keep}} a curb on myself when I talk to her. In fact, I've once or twice got mad. I can take a joke, but her condescending smile is riling." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{as though}} {{wondering}} how far I were in earnest.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> so piteously that I {{was near}} to being unmanned.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a fixed intentness which I found peculiarly irritating.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{hate that}} woman!" [...] Isobel exclaimed as I entered, [...] "I hate her! I would {{rather die than}} go to her. I would rather {{go back to the}} convent. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> as though I were {{something}} to be despised, something which {{should not be allowed to}} go alive upon the earth!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing much. The younger one--and I {{was half}} sorry I'd spoken {{straight}} to her--opened her eyes wide. The elder one <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{in a way}} that made me feel fit to choke her, while Haldane made a little bow. 'I have no doubt he is in capable hands, and we need not trouble you further. No, I don't think you need mention that we called,' says he." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "... Sent Minna {{out of my}} room, {{and hurt}} my {{sensitive}} girl cruelly. I am afraid of her! This last crime seems to separate me from that pure creature--all the more, {{because it has been}} committed in her dearest interests, and for her sweet sake. Every time <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> I am afraid she may see what I have done for her, in my face. Oh, how I long to take her in my arms, and devour her with kisses! I daren't do it--I daren't do it." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{seemed to}} come out of a reverie. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> inquiringly.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> attentively as I put {{the letter}} away in my pocket-book.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> for a moment, doubtfully, {{and then}} she shook her head.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lumley, I cannot! <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{out of his}} eyes; {{she speaks}} to me with his voice; {{something}} tells me that she bears in her heart his hate toward me. You do not know these Marionis! They are one in hate and one in love; unchanging and hard as the rocks on which their castle frowns. Even Margharita herself, in the old days, never forgave me for sending Leonardo to prison, although I saved her lover's {{life as well as}} mine. Lumley, you have said nothing to her?" ...|$|E
60|$|Ah, {{you would}} think so, I should have thought so, but I know myself now. When I reached London I did hear how my sister died, but still I was afraid. I saw myself in my mother’s room telling her why {{the door of the}} next room was locked, and I was afraid. God had done so much, and yet I could not look {{confidently}} to Him for the little that was left to do. ‘O ye of little faith!’ These are the words I seem to hear my mother saying to me now, and <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> so sorrowfully.|$|E
6000|$|... 'One child, I suppose some {{thirteen}} or {{fourteen years}} of age, I baptized on Christmas Day. Three days afterwards I married {{her to a}} young man who had been for some years with us. They are both natives of Nengone, one of the Loyalty Isles. I administered the Holy Eucharist to her last Saturday, and she is dying peacefully of consumption. What a blessed thing! This little one, fresh from Baptism, with all Church ministrations round her, passing gently away to her eternal rest. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with her soft dark eyes, and fondles my hand, and says she is not unhappy. She has, I verily believe, the secret of real happiness in her heart.|$|E
60|$|I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> her, {{astonished}} as she {{had been}} astonished when <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{remember}} how <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> expectantly, yet timidly, almost fearfully. I kissed her.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{and smiled}} a little abstractedly. Then {{she turned to the}} table.|$|R
6000|$|I offer obligingly {{to bring}} {{one of them}} to her, and now <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> suspiciously. ‘You surely believe I like yours best,’ she says with instant anxiety, and I soothe her by assurances, and retire advising her to read on, just to see if she can find out how he misleads the public. ‘Oh, I may {{take a look at it}} again by-and-by,’ she says indifferently, but {{nevertheless}} the probability is that as the door shuts the book opens, as if by some mechanical contrivance. I remember how she read ‘Treasure Island,’ holding it close to the ribs of the fire (because she could not spare a moment to rise and light the gas), and how, when bed-time came, and we coaxed, remonstrated, scolded, she said quite fiercely, clinging to the book, ‘I dinna lay my head on a pillow this night till I see how that laddie got out of the barrel.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Mistress,’ said she, ‘I must {{remind you}} of two things. Never speak as you do now of Madam Mendizabal; or never to a person of colour; for she is the most {{powerful}} woman in this world, and her real name even, if one durst pronounce it, were a spell to raise the dead. And whatever you do, speak no more of her to your unhappy Cora; for though it is possible she may be afraid of the police (and indeed I think that I have heard she is in hiding), and though I know that you will laugh and not believe, yet it is true, and proved, and known that she hears every word that people utter in this whole vast world; and your poor Cora is already deep enough in her black books. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> mistress, till my blood turns ice. That is the first I had to say; and now for the second: do, pray, for Heaven’s sake, bear in mind that you are no longer the poor Señor’s daughter. He is gone, dear gentleman; and now you are no more than a common slave-girl like myself. The man to whom you belong calls for you; oh, my dear mistress, go at once! With your youth and beauty, you may still, if you are winning and obedient, secure yourself an easy life.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|A poor devil {{of a man}} is most lucky when, loving, he is loved. Grievous indeed must be {{the fate}} of the lover who is unloved. And I, for one, and for still other reasons, congratulate myself upon the vastitude of my good fortune. For see, were Margaret any other sort of a woman, were she [...] . well, just the lovely and lovable and adorably snuggly sort who seem made just {{precisely}} for love and loving and nestling into the strong arms of a man--why, there wouldn't be anything remarkable or wonderful about her loving me. But Margaret is Margaret, strong, self-possessed, serene, controlled, a very mistress of herself. And there's the miracle--that such a woman should have been awakened to love by me. It is almost unbelievable. I go {{out of my way to}} get another peep into those long, cool, gray eyes of hers and see them grow melting soft as <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> She is no Juliet, thank the Lord; and thank the Lord I am no Romeo. And yet I go up alone on the freezing poop, and under my breath chant defiantly at the snorting gale, and at the graybeards thundering down on us, that I am a lover. And I send messages to the lonely albatrosses veering through the murk that I am a lover. And I look at the wretched sailors crawling along the spray-swept bridge and know that never in ten thousand wretched lives could they experience the love I experience, and I wonder why God ever made them.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> laughing, and not {{answering}} this: {{it was just}} her mother's trick.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> pondering, weaving her webs about me, lulling doubt, and banishing fear.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> smiling {{again through}} her tears, {{and shook her}} head a little.|$|R
