60|$|Every one {{has heard}} the great story of the Greeks who cried aloud in triumph {{when they saw the}} sea afar off; but it is a {{stranger}} experience to see the earth afar off. And few of us, strictly speaking, have ever seen the earth at all. In cultivated countries it is always clad, as it were, in green garments. The first sight of the desert is like the sight of a naked giant in the distance. The image is all the more natural because of the particular formation which it takes, at least as it borders upon the fields of Egypt, and as it is seen from the high places of Cairo. Those who have seen the desert only in pictures generally think of it as entirely flat. But this edge of it at least stands up on the horizon, as a line of wrinkled and hollow hills like the scalps of bald men; or worse, of bald women. For it is impossible not to think of such repulsive images, in spite of real sublimity of the call to the imagination. There is something curiously hostile and inhuman about the first appearance of the motionless surges of that dry and dreadful sea. Afterwards, if the traveller has happened to linger here and there in the outposts of the desert, has seen the British camp at Kantara or the graceful French garden town of Ismalia, he comes to take the desert as a background, and sometimes a beautiful background; a mirror of mighty reflections and changing colours almost as strange as the colours of the sea. But when it is first seen abutting, and as it were, advancing, upon the fields and gardens of humanity, then it looks indeed like an enemy, or a long line of enemies; like a line of tawny wild beasts thus halted with their heads lifted. It is the feeling that such vain and <b>sterile</b> <b>sand</b> can yet make itself into something like a mountain range; and the traveller remembers all the tragedies of the desert, when he lifts up his eyes to those accursed hills, from whence no help can come.|$|E

30|$|Two {{types of}} white maize hybrid seeds, Cebú and Garañón (Asgrow), {{were used for}} the in planta {{antagonism}} assay. Seeds were surface-sterilized prior to bioassays by placing them in 0.75  % sodium hypochlorite (w/v) at 52  °C for 20  min, followed by three copious washes with sterile distilled water for 5  min each (Daniels 1983). This methodology yielded 98 – 100  % seed germination with 1 – 3  % seed contamination. For this reason, seeds were pre-germinated on Komada’s Fusarium-selective medium (Komada 1975), and seeds with no symptoms of fungal growth (i.e. Fv-free) were selected, whereas those presenting contamination were eliminated. Bacterial isolates were grown in 15  ml tubes containing 5  ml of LB medium at 25  °C for 24  h at 250 rev/min, and an optical density (OD) of 1.0 at 595  nm was used to calculate the colony-forming units (c.f.u./ml) after plating. Maize seeds were soaked in bacterial suspensions containing 1.5  ×  108  c.f.u./ml for 20  min. Three seeds were planted per sterile polypropylene container (similar to a Magenta box) containing 200  g of wet <b>sterile</b> <b>sand.</b> Bacterial-treated seeds were transferred to sand inoculated with Fv isolate P 03 2  days before sowing, and control untreated seeds were placed in <b>sterile</b> <b>sand</b> containing Fv (which was added at a concentration of 1  ×  105 conidia/g of sand).

In <b>sterile</b> <b>sand</b> microcosms planted with alfalfa, the two microbes survived and grew, without any significant effect of co-inoculation. Co-inoculation led to the dissipation of 46 % of PHE after 21 days. In soil microcosms, whether planted with alfalfa or not, both strains persisted throughout the 46 days of the experiment, without any effect of co-inoculation or of alfalfa, as assessed by real-time PCR targeting taxon-level indicators, i. e.

40|$|On {{lateritic}} podzolic soils in Western Australia Eucalyptus calophylla is {{resistant to}} Phytophthora cinnamomi whereas Eucalyptus marginata is susceptible and eventually {{killed by the}} pathogen. On loam soils both eucalypts are resistant. Possible mechanisms for resistance of E. calophylla in lateritic soil and the inhibitory action of loam soils were investigated. Aseptically raised eucalypt seedlings succumbed to infection in liquid culture tubes. The mechanism of infection was compared by light and electron microscopy which showed similar fungal invasion and penetration into roots of both eucalypt species. Vegetative hyphae initially penetrated intercellularly and proliferated rapidly within cortical and stelar tissue. Intracellular invasion of these tissues occurred 48 hr after initial infection through dissolution of the host cell wall. Chlamydospores were formed within a number of cortical cells. Unsuberized roots of mature trees produced aseptically showed reactions to invasion {{similar to those of}} the eucalypt seedling roots. Suberized roots were not invaded.

The luminescence dating results are in good agreement with published chronologies derived using alternative radiometric dating methods (i. e., ESR and U-series dating of bracketing speleothems and combined ESR/U-series dating of herbivore teeth), as well as biochronology and palaeoenvironmental reconstructions inferred from proxy records (e. g., pollen data). For the majority of samples dated, however, the new luminescence ages are significantly (∼ 50 %) younger than previously published polymineral thermoluminescence (TL) chronologies, suggesting that the latter may have overestimated the true burial age of the Galería deposits. The luminescence ages obtained indicate that {{the top of the}} basal <b>sterile</b> <b>sands</b> (GIb) at Galería have an age of up to ∼ 370 thousand years (ka), while the lowermost sub-unit containing Mode II Acheulean lithics (base of unit GIIa) was deposited during MIS 9 (mean age =  313 ± 14 ka; n =  4).

In this study, {{the effect of}} 1. 5 % v/v calcium lignosulphonate (Ca-Ls) amendment to two commercial potting mixes (peat + coconut fibres; PC; and municipal compost + peat + pumice; MCPP) on the viability of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum sclerotia was investigated. Sclerotia were buried in the Ca-Ls amended substrates for 30 days. Non-amended PC and MCPP, <b>sterile</b> <b>sand</b> and sterile PC with and without Ca-Ls were used as controls. The viability of sclerotia recovered from PC and MCPP amended with Ca-Ls was reduced by 50 and 42 % respectively compared to control treatments. Ca-Ls amendment decreased sclerotial viability by enhancing {{the activity of the}} indigenous mycoparasitic fungi, Fusarium oxysporum, Mucor spp. and Trichoderma spp. The biocontrol ability of Ca-Ls against sclerotia was due to the stimulation of microbial activity and is, therefore, strictly dependent on the microbial composition of the substrate. </p...|$|E
40|$|In vitro shoots of Salvia santolinifolia were {{produced}} {{under the influence}} of different types of cytokinins supplementation by nodal segments on MS media. Excised young nodal segments of Salvia santolinifolia obtained from adult field-grown plants, successfully regenerated plant lets through organogenesis. Addition of BA at 1. 0, 2. 0 and 3. 0 mg/l produced maximum number and length of shoots. The multiplication of shoots was always slow in primary cultures and increased during subculture. Regenerated shoots produced roots on transfer to medium containing 2. 5 mg/l of IBA. Plant lets thus obtained were grown in <b>sterile</b> soil and <b>sand</b> mixture (1 : 1) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} of dead microbial biomass in a marine beach sand to degradation and mineralization was examined. Microbial sand populations were labeled with [14 C]glutamic acid, [3 H]adenine, or [3 H]thymidine and killed with chloroform. Live sand or seawater (or both) {{was added to}} the <b>sterile</b> labeled <b>sand,</b> and biochemical components of the populations were monitored for 10 days. Labeled RNA was degraded more quickly than labeled DNA, but both nucleic acids were degraded to approximately the same extent (60 to 70 %). 3 H 2 O was a major acid-soluble breakdown product. RNA (and possibly DNA) breakdown products were reincorporated into DNA (and possibly RNA) during the incubation period. In addition to metabolite salvage, 32 % of the total macromolecular 14 C was respired in the 10 -day period regardless of whether sand or seawater was used as the inoculum. Respiration was essentially complete in 3 days, whereas nucleic acid degradation continued throughout the 10 -day incubation. The results indicate that dead microbial biomass is a labile component of the sediment ecosystem...|$|R
40|$|A copper-resistant strain (09906) of Pseudomonas fluorescens {{that was}} {{isolated}} from a citrus grove soil {{is being investigated}} as a biological control agent for Phytophthora root rot. Since citrus grove soils in California are often contaminated with copper from many years of copper fungicide applications, the role of copper resistance in survival of strain 09906 was investigated. Three copper-sensitive Tn 5 mutants were obtained with insertions in different chromosomal DNA regions. These insertions {{were not in the}} chromosomal region that hybridized with the copper resistance operon (cop) cloned from Pseudomonas syringae. A copper-sensitive mutant survived as well as the wild type in a <b>sterile</b> loamy <b>sand</b> without added copper, but with 10 and 15 micrograms of CuSO 4 added per g of soil, populations of the copper-sensitive mutant were 27 - and 562 -fold lower, respectively, than that of the wild type after a 25 -day period. In a sterilized citrus grove soil, populations of the copper-sensitive mutant and wild-type strain were similar, but in nonsterile citrus soil, populations of the copper-sensitive mutant were 112 -fold lower than the wild type after 35 days. These data suggest that copper resistance genes can be important factors in persistence of P. fluorescens in soil contaminated with copper. In addition, these genes appear {{to play a role in}} competitive fitness, even in soils with a low copper content...|$|R
