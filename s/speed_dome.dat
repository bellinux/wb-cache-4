40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{quantity}} {{and characteristics of}} brown trout redds located in four streams of the Rudawa River basin in the Cracow Valleys Park (Park Dolinki Krakowskie) were investigated. The study was performed in late fall 2001 in the Bêdkówka, Kluczwoda, Racawka and Rudawka streams, {{all of which are}} left bank tributaries of the Rudawa River. A total of 328 redds were noted. The characteristics of twelve redds from each stream were described in detail, including water depth above the <b>dome,</b> water <b>speed</b> above the <b>dome</b> and the surface area of the redd. The contribution of certain gravel sizes in the composition of the domes was also investigated. There were no differences among the streams with reference to the surface areas of the redds or the water <b>speed</b> above the <b>domes.</b> The surface area of the redds ranged from 2081 to 3044 cm 2, while water <b>speed</b> above the <b>dome</b> varied from 73 to 82 cm s- 1. Significant differences in the water depth above the dome were noted among the different streams (from 12. 58 cm in the Kluczwoda to 33. 62 in the Rudawka). The contribution of fine gravel fraction (= 1 mm) also varied significantly among the streams. The highest sediment content was recorded in the Rudawka and Kluczwoda streams at 14. 22 and 13. 28 % of the total weight of the gravel sample, respectively. This indicates that, despite the large number of redds in these watercourses, the final results of spawning could be very poor because of the probability of the asphyxiation of embryos by sediments. The Bêdkówka Stream is the most productive and promising trout spawning ground in the whole basin, and, as such, should be put under special protection...|$|R
40|$|A new non-intrusive {{method for}} {{measuring}} the throughflow velocity crossing the dome of erupting bubbles in freely bubbling 2 -D fluidized beds is presented. Using a high <b>speed</b> video-camera, the <b>dome</b> acceleration, drag force and throughflow velocity profiles are obtained for different experiments, varying the superficial gas velocity. The acceleration profiles show greater values in the dome zone where the gravity component is negligible. The drag force and the throughflow velocity profiles show a uniform value in the central region of the dome and the total throughflow increases with the superficial gas velocity. Publicad...|$|R

They began their tour first by visiting most of the major cities throughout Japan. All of their concerts immediately sold out.

40|$|An {{assessment}} of the glaciological and meteorological characteristics of Dome A, {{the summit of the}} East Antarctic ice sheet, is made based on field investigations during the austral summer of 2004 / 05. Knowledge of these characteristics is critical for future international studies such as deep ice-core drilling. The assessment shows that: (1) Dome A is characterized by a very low 10 m depth firn temperature, – 58. 3 °C (nearly 3 °C lower than at EPICA Dome C and 1 °C lower than at Vostok). (2) Automatic weather station (AWS) measurements of snow surface height and reference layers in a snow pit indicate the present-day snow accumulation rate at Dome A is within the range 1 – 3 cm w. e. a– 1. Densification models suggest a range of 1 – 2 cm w. e. a– 1. This is lower than at other sites along the ice divide of East Antarctica (IDEA). Annual layers at Dome A are thus potentially thinner than at other sites, so that a longer record is preserved in a given ice thickness. (3) The average wind <b>speed</b> observed at <b>Dome</b> A (< 4 m s– 1) is lower than at other sites along IDEA. Together, these parameters, combined with radio-echo sounding data and information on the subglacial drainage distribution beneath Dome A, suggest Dome A as a candidate site for obtaining the oldest ice core...|$|R
40|$|The authors derive {{a string}} {{function}} {{that describes the}} propagation of large-scale, potentially large amplitude, baroclinic energy anomalies in a two-layer ocean with variable topography and rotation parameter. The generality of the two-layer results allows results for the 1 -layer, 1. 5 -layer, inverted 1. 5 -layer, lens, and dome models to be produced as limiting-cases. The string function is a scalar field {{that acts as a}} streamfunction for the propagation velocity. In the linear case the string function is simply c 2 o/f, where co is the background baroclinic shallow water wave speed, and typically describes propagation poleward on the eastern boundaries, westward (with some topographic steering) over the middle ocean, and equatorward on the western boundaries. In the more general nonlinear case, the string function is locally distorted by the anomaly. In the fully nonlinear examples of a lens or dome, there is no rest or background string function; the string function is generated entirely by the disturbance and propagation is due to asymmetric distribution of the anomalous mass over the string function contours. It is shown that conventional beta/topographic propagation results (e. g., beta drift of eddies, the Nof <b>speed</b> of cold <b>domes)</b> can be obtained as limiting cases of the string function. The string function provides, however, more general propagation velocities that are also usually simpler to derive. The first baroclinic mode string function for the global oceans is calculated from hydrographic data. The westward propagation speeds in the ocean basins as derived from the meridional gradient of the string function are typically two to five times faster than those expected from standard theory and agree well with the propagation speeds observed for long baroclinic Rossby waves in the TOPEX/Poseidon data...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are known to cool the subcloud layer by the introduction of penetrative downdrafts to the surface, resulting in the formation of cold domes (also known as cold pools). Five MCSs sampled during the Tropical Ocean-Global Atmosphere (TOGA) Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE) are analyzed to relate properties of the cold domes to those of the inflow environments. Data from two NOAA P 3 aircraft are used to determine the mean temperature, specific humidity, and wind speeds in the cold domes. Unique to this project is that low-level altitude flight legs ranged from 35 m to 300 m. Composite soundings of the inflow environment were constructed using flight level data from the NOAA P 3 s, the NCAR Electra and the NASA DC- 8 aircraft, as well as dropsonde data from the DC- 8 and rawinsonde data from nearby island and ship sites. All the MCSs examined produced cold domes that were accompanied by increases in wind speed. These changes in temperature and wind speed between the cold dome and the inflow environments led to significant increases in the sensible heat flux that is dependent on these two variables. Changes in the specific humidity were not as consistent. The majority of the cases display a decrease in specific humidity within their cold domes. As a result, increases in the latent heat fluxes observed in the cold domes were more dependent on the increases in wind <b>speed.</b> Stronger cold <b>domes</b> (cool, dry and strong winds) were associated with squall line MCSs, while non-squall line MCSs produced weaker cold domes (cool, weak to moderate winds), that were not necessarily less moist than the inflow environment...|$|R
