5|$|Baeyertz's {{husband died}} on 6 March 1871 {{at the age}} of 28, two days after a {{shooting}} accident. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Anglican church to help her and she experienced a full conversion to the religion. She put her children into boarding school and became an evangelist, visiting jails and hospitals to spread the religion, as well as door-to-door preaching to the Jewish areas of Melbourne.

5|$|She wore an {{imported}} black satin dress heavily beaded {{with tiny}} black jet beads, black satin slippers, beaded, and {{had on her}} rarely beautiful diamonds.... She stood before us, seemingly slight, graceful of carriage, and exquisitely beautiful even to critical eyes. Then, still standing, she faced her class as one who knew herself {{to be a teacher}} by divine right. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> student {{at the end of the}} first row of seats and took direct mental cognizance of this one, plainly knocked at the door of this individual consciousness.... This continued until each member of the class had received the same mental cognizance. No audible word voiced the purely mental contact.|$|E
25|$|On 20 July 1996, Qazi Hussain Ahmed of Jamaat e Islami {{announced}} to start protests against government alleging corruption. Qazi Hussain resigned from senate on 27 September and {{announced to}} start long march against Benazir government. Protest started on 27 October 1996 by Jamaat e Islami and opposition parties. On 4 November 1996, Bhutto's government was dismissed by President Leghari {{primarily because of}} corruption, who used the Eighth Amendment discretionary powers to dissolve the government. Benazir was surprised when she discovered {{that it was not}} the military who had dismissed her but her own hand-picked puppet President who had used the power to dismiss her. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Court hoping for gaining Leghari's actions unconstitutional. But the Supreme Court justified and affirmed President Leghari's dismissal in a 6–1 ruling. Many military leaders who were close to Prime minister rather than the President, did not wanted Benazir Bhutto's government to fall, as they resisted the Nawaz Sharif's conservatism.|$|E

Lopez wore a shiny gold catsuite for the performance, {{which did not}} go as planned when halfway through the performance her microphone failed. She continued performing for 20 seconds, before realising that she had lost sound. According to lifestyle website Female First, Lopez proceeded to dance, and urged the audience to sing along. At {{the end of the}} performance, Lopez addressed the crowd straight after the performance, saying [...] "We ain't gonna let that get us down, right? Nobody keeps mama down." [...] After Pitbull informed her of the malfunction, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> band asking them to start from the beginning so that she could perform the song again.|$|E

2500|$|Transcendentalist Moncure D. Conway, {{who helped}} secure the {{publication}} of the sketches in the Commonwealth, recommended they be collected as a book. The author was approached by Thomas Niles, an up-and-coming employee of Roberts Brothers, to publish the sketches in book form. Instead, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> more established publisher James Redpath, who paid her $40 for the book. At her father's suggestion, the book was dedicated to Hannah Stevenson, a friend who had helped Alcott secure her position as a volunteer nurse. The book, priced at 50 cents, earned the author five cents in royalties for every copy sold, with an additional five cents donated to children orphaned by the war. Years later, Walt Whitman contacted Redpath, hoping he would publish his own recollections as a Civil War nurse. As he wrote, the book Memoranda During the War, would be [...] "something considerably more than mere hospital sketches." ...|$|E
2500|$|The accuser's mother, Janet Arvizo, {{testified that}} on a flight from Miami to Los Angeles, she [...] "saw Michael licking Gavin's head" [...] while he was asleep.

[...] Jackson {{allegedly}} had an arm around the boy and licked his hair [...] "over and over" [...] while everyone else on the plane was asleep. Janet said she didn't tell any one what she'd seen, and she continued to let her children stay at Neverland, and she later testified that at a point weeks after that incident, she still didn't have [...] "any concerns about Mr. Jackson at all". Star contradicted his mother when he testified {{that he had been}} awake to also witness Jackson lick Gavin's head on the plane; he didn't say anyone was asleep, just that the accuser was not feeling well and had leaned against Jackson's chest. Cynthia Bell, a flight attendant on that flight, said she had not seen Jackson [...] "cuddling" [...] with Arvizo during the flight, but testified that she had seen Jackson put his arm around the accuser while he was listening to music.|$|E

60|$|Every now {{and again}} she looks towards the door and listens: then <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> open window.

60|$|FANNY. You {{heard my}} orders. [Her tone {{has the right}} ring. The force of habit is too strong upon him. He yields--savagely--and goes out. <b>She</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Doctor.] So sorry I had to drag you into it. I didn't see how else I was going to floor him.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> office. Mr. Mool {{actually}} {{tried to}} stop her.|$|R
