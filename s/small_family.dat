30|$|There are, however, {{reasons to}} believe that the {{relationship}} between the size of the household and exit from entrepreneurship is not linear but U-shaped. <b>Small</b> <b>families</b> have more flexibility than larger <b>families.</b> In <b>small</b> <b>families,</b> it is easier to make decisions that concern work as well as other issues. Singles with no children have no other person in the household to consider and therefore have the highest flexibility. Families with two or more adults and a high number of children have the lowest flexibility.|$|R
40|$|This paper, {{the second}} in a series {{analysing}} data from the National Weed List, concentrates on weedy changes that affect the indigenous flora. The incidence of weediness and of threatened species is used {{as an indication of}} success or failure of families under prevailing conditions of disturbance. The resulting power shifts between indigenous families and the impact of exotic weeds on the situation are reviewed. Many power shifts are taking place between indigenous species in the veld. Superficially it seems as though a relatively few invasive species are displacing a larger number of threatened species, but evidence from Natal points to more species increasing than decreasing under conditions of over-utilization. Amongst <b>small</b> <b>families</b> power shifts are almost as prevalent and important as at species level. Seventeen <b>small</b> <b>families</b> have over 20 % indigenous weed species. Thirty <b>small</b> <b>families</b> have over 20 % threatened species, and 21 <b>small</b> <b>families</b> have had their species numbers bolstered by more than  20 % by exotic weeds. A very few large and medium-sized families contain over 50 % of our weeds and our threatened species. It is mostly temperate (Cape) families that are under pressure relative to more tropical families. This trend is echoed at sub-family level within the Fabaceae. </p...|$|R

40|$|The progeny of <b>small</b> <b>families</b> {{are likely}} to inherit more wealth than are {{children}} with greater numbers of siblings for two rather simple reasons: parents of <b>smaller</b> <b>families</b> can save more, and they have fewer heirs among which to leave their accumulated wealth. If subpopulations such as Catholics and blacks have larger than average families and Jews tend toward <b>smaller</b> <b>families,</b> this simple demographic fact may have a sub-stantial impact {{on the distribution of}} wealth which is unrelated to any overt or subtle discriminatory behavior of the dominant population. How large are the effects of family size likely to be? An adequate data base to answer the question directly does not exist. We therefore created a synthetic population with the characteristics of the 1962 U.
