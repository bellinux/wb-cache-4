5|$|The Reuleaux {{triangle}} is {{the first}} of a sequence of Reuleaux polygons, whose boundaries are curves of constant width formed from regular polygons with an odd number of sides. Some of these curves have been used as the shapes of coins. The Reuleaux triangle can also be generalized into three dimensions in multiple ways: the Reuleaux tetrahedron (the intersection of four balls whose centers lie on a regular tetrahedron) does not have constant width, but can be modified by rounding its edges to form the Meissner tetrahedron, which does. Alternatively, the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> of the Reuleaux triangle also has constant width.|$|E

Standard methods for fitting such surfaces are either specialized {{to a small}} subset <b>of</b> these <b>surface</b> types (either focusing exclusively on cylinders or exclusively on <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolution)</b> or otherwise are basis-dependent (leading to scale-dependent results). Previous work has suggested re-scaling data to a fixed size bounding box to avoid the basis-dependence issues. We show that this method fails on some simple, common cases such as a box or a cone with small noise. We propose instead adapting a well-studied approximate maximum-likelihood method to the kinematic surface fitting problem, which solves the basis-dependence issue.
