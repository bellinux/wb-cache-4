25|$|At a {{temperature}} below the freezing point, a liquid {{will tend to}} crystallize, changing to its solid form. Unlike the transition to gas, there is no equilibrium at this transition under constant pressure, so unless <b>supercooling</b> occurs, the liquid will eventually completely crystallize. Note that this is only true under constant pressure, so e.g. water and ice in a closed, strong container might reach an equilibrium where both phases coexist. For the opposite transition from solid to liquid, see melting.|$|E
25|$|Liquid {{particles}} are bound firmly but not rigidly. They {{are able to}} move around one another freely, resulting in a limited degree of particle mobility. As the temperature increases, the increased vibrations of the molecules causes distances between the molecules to increase. When a liquid reaches its boiling point, the cohesive forces that bind the molecules closely together break, and the liquid changes to its gaseous state (unless superheating occurs). If the temperature is decreased, the distances between the molecules become smaller. When the liquid reaches its freezing point the molecules will usually lock into a very specific order, called crystallizing, and the bonds between them become more rigid, changing the liquid into its solid state (unless <b>supercooling</b> occurs).|$|E
25|$|The rate {{of cooling}} {{has been shown to}} {{influence}} the frost resistance of tissues, but the actual rate of freezing will depend not only on the cooling rate, but also on the degree of <b>supercooling</b> and the properties of the tissue. Sakai (1979a) demonstrated ice segregation in shoot primordia of Alaskan white and black spruces when cooled slowly to 30nbsp&°C to -40nbsp&°C. These freeze-dehydrated buds survived immersion in liquid nitrogen when slowly rewarmed. Floral primordia responded similarly. Extraorgan freezing in the primordia accounts for the ability of the hardiest of the boreal conifers to survive winters in regions when air temperatures often fall to -50nbsp&°C or lower. The hardiness of the winter buds of such conifers is enhanced by the smallness of the buds, by the evolution of faster translocation of water, and an ability to tolerate intensive freeze dehydration. In boreal species of Picea and Pinus, the frost resistance of 1-year-old seedlings is on a par with mature plants, given similar states of dormancy.|$|E

40|$|For {{a deeply}} <b>supercooled</b> liquid just above its glass {{transition}} temperature, {{we present a}} simple thermodynamic model, where the deeply <b>supercooled</b> liquid {{is assumed to be}} a mixture of solid-like and liquid-like micro regions. The mole fraction of the liquid-like regions controls the thermodynamic properties of the <b>supercooled</b> liquid while that of the solid-like regions controls its relaxation time or viscosity. From the universal temperature dependence of the molar excess entropy for the deeply <b>supercooled</b> liquids, we derive the temperature dependence of the mole fraction of the liquid-like regions to obtain the universal temperature dependence of the relaxation time or the viscosity for the deeply <b>supercooled</b> liquids. A central parameter of our model is then shown to be a measure for the fragility of a <b>supercooled</b> liquid. We also suggest a way to test our physical picture of deeply <b>supercooled</b> liquids by means of molecular dynamics simulations of model liquids.

5|$|Other {{observations}} in Hurricanes Anita, David, Frederic, and Allen {{also discovered that}} tropical cyclones have very little <b>supercooled</b> water {{and a great deal}} of ice crystals. The reason that tropical cyclones have little <b>supercooled</b> water is that the updrafts within such a system are too weak to prevent water from either falling as rain or freezing.

25|$|An {{alternative}} idea {{to explain}} the greater prevalence of diabetes in more northerly populations was suggested by Moalem et al. who noted that recent animal research has uncovered {{the importance of the}} generation of elevated levels of glucose, glycerol and other sugar derivatives as a physiological means for cold adaptation. High concentrations of these substances depress the freezing point of body fluids and prevent the formation of ice crystals in cells through <b>supercooling,</b> thus acting as a cryoprotectant or antifreeze for vital organs as well as in their muscle tissue. They consequently suggested that factors predisposing to elevated levels of glucose, glycerol and other sugar derivatives may have been selected for, in part, as adaptive measures in exceedingly cold climates. The authors suggest that this cryoprotective adaptation would have protected ancestral northern Europeans from the effects of suddenly increasingly colder climates, such as those believed to have arisen around 14,000 years ago and culminating in the Younger Dryas. A major issue with this whole idea, however, is that glucose, gycerol and sugar derivatives only become useful as cryoprotectants as the body temperature falls to the point where tissues are at risk of freezing – which is below 0 oC. Since no human ever survived a period of hypothermia with a body temperature less than 10 oC, because of heart failure, there is no possibility that this could ever have provided any selective advantage in our past history – no matter how cold the external temperature was.|$|E

2500|$|Guth {{decided to}} solve this problem by {{suggesting}} a <b>supercooling</b> during a delayed phase transition. This seemed very promising for solving the magnetic monopole problem. By the time they came up with that, Guth had gone to the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) for a year, but Guth had been talking to Henry Tye back and forth. Tye suggested that they check that {{the expansion of the universe}} would not be affected by the <b>supercooling.</b> In the supercooled state, a false vacuum is produced. The false vacuum is a vacuum in the sense that it is state of the lowest possible density of energy; it is false in the sense that it is not a permanent state of being. False vacuums decay, and Guth was to find that the decay of the false vacuum at the beginning of the universe would produce amazing results, namely the exponential expansion of space. [...] This solved the monopole problem, since the expansion dilutes the monopole density.|$|E

2500|$|Between {{removal from}} donor and {{transplantation}} into the recipient the liver is cooled in an ice-cold preservation solution. The cold temperature slows down deterioration and solution {{is designed to}} counteract the unwanted effects of cold ischemia. Besides this method of static cold storage, various dynamic preservation methods are under development, including machine perfusion. Machine perfusion restores a flow through the liver while it's outside the body (ex vivo). This is currently being investigated at cold (hypothermic), body temperature (normothermic), and under body temperature (subnormothermic). Hypothermic machine perfusion has been used successfully at Columbia University and at the University of Zurich.

50|$|In {{order to}} survive extreme low {{temperatures}} in certain environments, some animals undergo forms of <b>supercooling</b> {{that allow them to}} remain unfrozen and avoid cell damage and death. There are many techniques that aid in <b>supercooling,</b> such as the production of antifreeze proteins, or AFPs, which bind to ice crystals to prevent water molecules from binding and spreading the growth of ice. The winter flounder is one such fish that utilizes these proteins to survive in its frigid environment. Noncolligative proteins are secreted by the liver into the bloodstream. Other animals use colligative antifreezes, which increases the concentration of solutes in their bodily fluids, thus lowering their freezing point. Fish that rely on <b>supercooling</b> for survival must also live well below the water surface, because if they came into contact with ice nuclei they would freeze immediately.
