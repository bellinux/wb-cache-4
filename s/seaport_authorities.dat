40|$|In all European seaports, {{organisational}} efficiency forms a vital {{component of}} the activities to improve competitiveness in the market. As public enterprise entities, Portuguese seaports rely on government subsidies to meet their deficits. The policy of subsidisation {{is part of the}} regulatory procedures that are intended to provide incentives for increasing productive efficiency, thereby allowing seaports to share in the social gains from efficiency in the form of greater, or at least stable, employment and local development. In addition, the drive for greater efficiency is meant to assist the ports' preparation for some kind of privatisation. In this paper, we analyse the technical and allocative efficiencies of Portuguese <b>seaport</b> <b>authorities</b> in order to investigate if the state's policy is achieving its aims. We find that the results are, at best, mixed, leading us to conclude that the incentive regulation carried out by the government's regulatory body, the Maritime Port Agency, is not achieving its aims. Therefore, we propose a policy revision to enforce efficiency, based on a governance environment framework.

This complements what has been reported in other studies [1, 13, 39], seaport efficiency is not necessary influenced by its cargo throughput. In addition, Al-Eraqui et al.

40|$|AbstractThe {{maritime}} industry in Lithuania {{is based on}} the public, state, and private sectors, and on the interests, activities and partnership of business companies operating in the aforementioned sectors. Despite the management of the public sector in Lithuania being criticized for showing performance shortcomings, the state of Klaipeda's seaport management and performance results refutes this criticism. The overall result of partnerships and co-operation is obtained – it reflects the port's competitiveness level in the region. According to a report conducted by the International Monetary Fund, the potential output growth in 2014 – 2015 has declined since the global financial crisis. Policy actions are required to boost the productivity levels, and to foster capital growth. In order to achieve these objectives, it is essential to know the company's financial situation better, because the better the financial state of the company, the more new port service users, cargo owners, shipping lines, and investors it attracts. The standard analysis of financial indicators is insufficient. Hence the method of integrated analysis is applied.

40|$|This study {{concentrates}} on the pricing of seaport infrastructure which includes port charges {{on the use of}} access channels and berth facilities. A closer examination of published port tariffs reveals that the port entry and berth use-related port tariffs, often referred to as channel dues and berth occupancy charges, are differentiated based on vessel volume (Gross Tonnage, Gross Registered Tonnage and Length Over All), ship type (container ship, general cargo ship, tanker) and traffic type (foreign-going vessels and coastal vessels). These two charges are one of the main revenue sources for a port authority; however knowledge of the design and imposition of these charges is currently opaque, but nevertheless very useful to port users. This thesis explores the determinants of port infrastructure charges that underpin port pricing policies in world ports. The main objectives of the study are: (a) Identify and conduct an econometric analysis of the effect of various factors on seaport infrastructure charges. (b) To assess the applicability of competing pricing models (pricing approaches) currently used by seaports in different countries and regions in the world. (c) To assess the determinants of port infrastructure tariff design and practices in world seaports and discuss their implications for port management. This thesis brings to notice that, despite the discussion on port pricing theories such as cost-based, market based and cost-benefit theories, the empirical research on this topic remains very limited. Thus, with identified research gaps such as the determination of the level of knowledge that port authorities have in tariff design and their applicability, the thesis investigates the underlying factors influential to the design and practice of port infrastructure tariffs using both quantitative and qualitative research approaches. First, the determinants of port infrastructure charges are studied empirically using data from 159 ports worldwide by employing the ordinary least square and simultaneous equation system method with channel dues and berth occupancy charges as the dependent variables. The result indicates that the pricing of seaport infrastructure is primarily cost-based but other factors are also relevant to the port pricing models currently used by seaports. Among those factors in particular, demand and the type of port management and governance model have been found to significantly impact the level of port infrastructure charges. Second, to complement and triangulate some of the results found in the quantitative model, this thesis examines the primary data collected through an online survey of 67 international seaports to focus on the practical processes and strategic issues in infrastructure tariff design and practice. The questionnaire was sent to higher level seaport managers working in the areas of port tariffs. The contact details of port managers were obtained from the official port websites of respective port organisations. SPSS and AMOS statistical software were employed to analyse the data. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were used to identify the factors influential to the selection of infrastructure tariff models, the tariff level and the tariff revision process. The results showed that the influential factors in infrastructure tariff design are: a) demand, b) knowledge of pricing theories, c) pricing objectives, d) port cost considerations, and e) dynamics of port and shipping sectors (competition and ship size). Further, an analysis into the factors influential in infrastructure tariff practices of seaports suggested that tariff policies, transparency in tariff setting, tariff regulation and stakeholder participation in tariff affairs are highly significant. Third, the content analysis of two open-ended questions included in the questionnaire to <b>seaport</b> <b>authorities</b> revealed that tariff revision practices vary substantially across ports and regions in the world. Some ports revise tariffs regularly while others seldom do so. Furthermore tariff revision procedures and the parties involved in the process also vary across ports; some ports have highly bureaucratic procedures for tariff revision and others determine their tariff revision decisions independently. Many <b>seaport</b> <b>authorities</b> are not aware of all the basic pricing approaches and their applications, and expressed a wish to receive training and support in tariff design and revision. Based on the results of the quantitative and qualitative analysis, the implications for port management and governments are discussed and, given the exploratory nature of the study, the implications for future research and its limitations are also presented...|$|E

The Klaipeda State <b>Seaport</b> <b>Authority</b> (KSSA) {{is in charge of the}} management and the provision of efficient hinterland connections. It considers increasing the depth to - 18 m CD at the quays necessary for attracting more cargo. This maximum depth is governed by the largest vessels that can enter the Baltic Sea. The port, therefore, wants to know the surplus value of this extra depth. The following questions are raised in this study: 1. what cargoes are likely to be captured with an extra depth of - 18 m CD? 2. where can the extra deepening be realised? 3. is a depth of - 18 m CD needed? A study on the present traded cargo and future expectations of cargo pointed out that the most important growth markets will be container trade and coal trade. The coal will be used for the supply of energy. The present energy supply of Lithuania is produced by a nuclear power plant close to Ignalina. This is a plant of the Tjernobyl type. The safety at this power plant is not optimal and the lifetime of the plant ends by 2005 - 2010. Therefore a new power plant which is coal fired is assumed in this study. The possibilities of using the existing port for the deepening are investigated and it is concluded that the deepening of the complete existing port seems rather expensive because of the present quay structures and the total volume of dredging works. The existing quay structures must be improved in case the port is deepened because its fundaments do not reach deep enough and stability cannot be guaranteed. Further, the space in the port is limited for constructing the associated terminals and the presence of the city obstructs efficient through transport to the hinterland. Another problem for the expansion of the existing port for larger depth is the width of the present entrance channel. The present entrance channel is narrow and widening is difficult because of the presence of the breakwaters. The largest vessels which can enter the Baltic Sea cannot enter the port of Klaipeda, unless the breakwater layout is adjusted, which is rather expensive. In order to calculate whether the depth of 18 meter is justified, four transportation schemes are discussed. Four alternatives are used for transporting the total volume of coal using different depth in the entrance channel and port. For the four alternatives the total cost of transporting the coal from the sending port to the power plant is calculated. These costs consist of cost of chartering the vessels which are needed for transporting the 15 million tons of coal, construction of the port which will determine the port tariffs and the through transport costs from the port to the power plant. These costs are described in table i by Sea for the sea transport, by Port for the port tariff and Land for the overland transport cost. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
