The land mammals are mostly nocturnal and avoid human contact. National parks, which provide protection to the mammals, are the most likely locations where these animals can be seen. There are 18 endemic mammal species. Marine mammals (such as whales, otters, sea lions, dolphins) and birds are quite easily seen along the long coastline in the Pacific Ocean {{to the west of the}} country. Of the more than 600 vertebrate species in the country, only two dozen are considered to be exotic.Notable mammal species include guanacos (a form of the wild llama), feral minks, armadillos, culpeo (fox), and opossums.

50|$|Deer {{constitute}} {{the second most}} diverse family after bovids. Though of a similar build, deer are strongly distinguished from antelopes by their antlers, which are temporary and regularly regrown unlike the permanent horns of bovids. Characteristics typical of deer include long, powerful legs, a diminutive tail and long ears. Deer exhibit a broad variation in physical proportions. The largest extant deer is the moose, which is nearly 2.6 m tall and weighs up to 800 kg. The elk stands 1.4 - 2 m at the shoulder and weighs 240 - 450 kg.

40|$|Resumen del póster presentado al 12 th International Congress of the Spanish Association of Animal Reproduction, celebrado en Alicante del 16 al 18 de octubre de 2014. The <b>southern</b> <b>Pudu</b> (Pudu puda) is a cervid species {{which has}} been {{classified}} as vulnerable by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature). In this context, {{it is essential to}} develop semen collection methods and cryopreservation protocols in order to keep sperm samples for conservation purposes. The aim of this work was to study the effect of two sperm collection methods (electroejaculation (EE) vs. rectal massage (RM)) and two glycerol concentrations (3 % vs. 6 %) on sperm quality after cryopreservation procedure. Semen from six adult males was obtained by EE and RM. Then, each sperm sample was split into two aliquots, being one of them diluted with Tris medium+ 3 % of glycerol and the other one with Tris medium+ 6 % of glycerol and subsequently frozen. Sperm motility, viability and acrosomal integrity were assessed after collection, before cryopreservation, at thawing and after 2 h of incubation. A GLMANOVA was carried out and differences were considered significant when p ≤ 0. 05. There were not differences between both sperm collection methods studied. However, when we assessed glycerol concentrations for each collection methods we observed higher significant sperm viability, motility and spermatozoa with intact acrosome (p ≤ 0. 05) for 3 % of glycerol compared to 6 % after 2 h of incubation. In conclusion, sperm samples from Pudu can be successfully collected by EE or RM and cryopreserved with an extender containing 3 % of glycerol. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} <b>southern</b> <b>pudu</b> (Pudu puda) was {{performed}} at the zoo Nordens Ark in Bohuslän, Sweden during twelve days in Mars and April 2014. Observations were performed during twilight. Time budget and enclosure use was examined, when the animals {{had access to the}} whole enclosure of 1000 m 2 or a smaller part of the enclosure of 200 m 2. There was almost no difference in time budget between the two enclosure sizes. At both enclosure sizes the animals spent most of the time at a place that was hidden from outside the enclosure. The hidden place was situated in the house. Also {{the rest of the house}} was a place where the animals spent a lot of time. The big enclosure part, the part of the enclosure that the animals did not have access to in the 200 m 2 enclosure, was more rocky and hilly, which might have been features the animals preferred. Another reason to the preference of the big enclosure part might have been that the animals didn’t have access to that part of the enclosure the whole time and therefor found it more exciting. The three small shelters in the enclosure were seldom used. The shelter that was used the most was located in the part of the enclosure the animals didn’t have access to when they were in the small enclosure. The pudus seemed to be affected by not always having access to the whole enclosure, but additional observations are desired to ensure chance didn’t impact on the results. In the future it would be interesting to do a follow-up to study the animals at different times of the day. It would also be interesting to study enrichments to see if the animals would like to spend more time in other places than the house if the rest of the enclosure was enriched...|$|E
40|$|Domestic {{dogs are}} the most {{abundant}} carnivores worldwide. Food and other subsidies to dogs do not prevent their predation on wildlife. Dog impacts on wildlife are suspected to be significant, yet the nature of dog-wildlife interactions is not fully understood. In this context I addressed three specific objectives. First, I tested {{the hypothesis that the}} distribution of dogs influences the space use of potential prey. This hypothesis was tested using as target species the <b>southern</b> <b>pudu</b> (Pudu puda), a globally vulnerable deer. Second, I tested the hypothesis that the management of domestic dogs and cats influences their impacts on wild vertebrates. Third, I assessed whether dogs are a global concern for biodiversity conservation by conducting a broad literatura review. The study conducted on pudus in Chile revealed that dogs are frequent and efficient predators of this species. In occupancy models applied to camera-trap data, the variable that best explained the distribution of pudus was the probability of dog presence. The second study, confirmad that domestic dogs preyed on most threatened mammals present in two sites. My results provided support for the hypothesis that the less ca re domestic animals receive from owners the higher the probability those animals will prey on wildlife. Finally, the literature review showed that dogs are considered a threat for 160 mammalian species. These numbers are very similar to those observed for feral cats, one of the most damaging invasive species worldwide. The review al so revealed that the few studies on the spatial consequences of the presence of dogs converge in suggesting that they are a threat for groups such as Carnivores and Artiodactyls. M y findings suggest that dogs are efficient predators for species such as the pudu, and that these predation events may have consequences for the distribution of these species. Considering the potentially large number of species affected by dogs, {{and the fact that the}} impacts of dogs depend especially on human factors, I discuss the role of dog management to reduce their impacts...|$|E
40|$|Numerous deer {{species have}} been {{introduced}} beyond their native range into ecosystems around the world. Their economic value leads to further accidental and deliberate releases and lack of control is contributing to range expansion in Australia, South America and Europe. Despite localised or regional concern, the scale and generality of detrimental impacts have not been widely recognised. We review the direct and indirect impacts on ecosystems and evidence for interspecific effects on native deer. In New Zealand, where large herbivores were previously absent, severe and novel impacts {{have been found in}} susceptible forests. Even where ecosystems contain native deer, invasion by taxonomically exotic deer species carries the risk of cascade effects on spatial plant dynamics and forest composition. In Patagonia, introduced deer have disrupted forest composition, whereas in Europe, ecosystem impacts of introduced species can differ from those of over-abundant native deer. Introduced Chinese muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi) within a coniferous forestry landscape in eastern England differ from native European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in their distribution of herbivory among differing habitats, and provide much lower rates of endozoochorous seed dispersal. Frequent concern is expressed that introduced deer species may have detrimental effects on native deer and other ungulates, although potential epidemiological effects have not been investigated. Apparent competition, with introduced prey resulting in increased predation rates on native deer, may be occurring between South American huemul (Hippocamelus bisulcus) and <b>southern</b> <b>pudu</b> (Pudu puda). Habitat and dietary overlap is often substantial among native and introduced ungulates, including deer, and exploitation competition is likely. Evidence includes spatial responses of native to non-native deer and negatively correlated changes in population abundance, but demographic mechanisms have not been demonstrated previously. In a coniferous forestry landscape in eastern England, substantial habitat and dietary overlap occurs between native roe deer and high-density introduced Chinese muntjac. This roe deer population has shown a reduction in body weight and fertility following establishment and increasing abundance of non-native Chinese muntjac, compatible with interspecific competition. European roe deer also appear susceptible to competition from larger grazing deer, including native red deer (Cervus elaphus) and introduced fallow (Dama dama). The widely introduced fallow deer may be a particularly effective competitor in sympatry with intermediate or concentrate feeders. There is need for further investigation of potential interactions of introduced and native deer species, and a wider recognition of the ecological impacts of introduced deer...|$|E
