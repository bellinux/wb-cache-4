5|$|The {{companion}} star is a dense {{white dwarf}} star. This category of stellar object {{has reached the}} end of its evolutionary life span and is no longer generating energy through nuclear fusion.

5|$|Thermal mass is any {{material}} {{that can be}} used to store heat—heat from the Sun in the case of solar energy. Common thermal mass materials include stone, cement and water. Historically they have been used in arid climates or warm temperate regions to keep buildings cool by absorbing solar energy during the day and radiating <b>stored</b> <b>heat</b> to the cooler atmosphere at night. However, they can be used in cold temperate areas to maintain warmth as well. The size and placement of thermal mass depend on several factors such as climate, daylighting and shading conditions. When properly incorporated, thermal mass maintains space temperatures in a comfortable range and reduces the need for auxiliary heating and cooling equipment.|$|E
25|$|A Trombe wall is {{a passive}} solar heating and {{ventilation}} system consisting of an air channel sandwiched between a window and a sun-facing thermal mass.

500|$|To avoid {{problems}} with smoke and steam overwhelming staff and {{passengers on the}} covered sections of the Metropolitan Railway, Fowler proposed a fireless locomotive. The locomotive was built by Robert Stephenson and Company and was a broad gauge 2-4-0 tender engine. The boiler had a normal firebox connected to a large combustion chamber containing fire bricks which were {{to act as a}} heat reservoir. The combustion chamber was linked to the smokebox through a set of very short firetubes. [...] Exhaust steam was re-condensed instead of escaping and fed back to the boiler. The locomotive was intended to operate conventionally in the open, but in tunnels dampers would be closed and steam would be generated using the <b>stored</b> <b>heat</b> from the fire bricks.|$|E
500|$|As was {{explained}} by Leon Mestel in 1952, unless the white dwarf accretes matter from a companion star or other source, its radiation comes from its <b>stored</b> <b>heat,</b> {{which is not}} replenished.,§2.1. White dwarfs have an extremely small surface area to radiate this heat from, so they cool gradually, remaining hot for a long time. As a white dwarf cools, its surface temperature decreases, the radiation which it emits reddens, and its luminosity decreases. Since the white dwarf has no energy sink other than radiation, it follows that its cooling slows with time. The rate of cooling has been estimated for a carbon white dwarf of 0.59 [...] with a hydrogen atmosphere. After initially taking approximately 1.5billion years to cool to a surface temperature of 7,140K, cooling approximately 500 more kelvins to 6,590K takes around 0.3billion years, but the next two steps of around 500kelvins (to 6,030K and 5,550K) take first 0.4 and then 1.1billion years., Table 2.|$|E
