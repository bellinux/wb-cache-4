The genus Apophysomyces {{was first published in}} 1979 by Misra et al. who isolated A. elegans from soil in northern India. Apophysomyces variabilis was considered to be the same species as Apophysomyces elegans until September 2012 when Alvarez et al. determined that 16 strains of A. elegans were actually a complex of species in the genus Apophysomyces. Based on genetic, physiological, and morphological analyses, the authors concluded that the sixteen environmental and clinical strains of A. elegans could be divided in four clades corresponding to the species; A. elegans, A. trapeziformis, A. ossiformis, and A. variabilis. The species were differentiated based on the <b>sporangiospore</b> shape, [...] type, and apophyseal shape. As well, carbon fixation ability aided in species differentiation with only A. elegans strains being able to assimilate the glycoside esculin. Alvarez et al. analysed three loci: the H3 gene, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of the nuclear rRNA gene, and the D1 and D2 domains of the 28S rRNA gene. This analysis resulted in a phylogeny containing the four clades. Interestingly, not one of the disease strains that had been identified as [...] "A. elegans" [...] clustered with taxonomically important strains of A. elegans in molecular phylogenetic analyses. Accordingly, the role of A. elegans (in the strict sense) as a human pathogen may warrant reconsideration.|$|E
50|$|The {{evolution}} of the conidium from the <b>sporangiospore</b> is the main defining difference between zygomycetes and ascomycetes. The {{evolution of}} sporangiospores typical of zygomycetes to conidia {{similar to those found}} in ascomycetes can be modeled by a series of forms seen in zygomycetes. Many zygomycetes produce multiple sporangiospores inside a single sporangium. Some have evolved multiple small sporangiola that contain few sporangiospores. In some cases, there may be a few as three spores in each sporangiolum, and a few species have sporangiola which contain just a single spore. Choanephora, a zygomycete, has a sporangiolum that contains one spore with a sporangium wall that is visible {{at the base of the}} sporangium. This structure is similar to a conidium, which has two, fused cell walls, an inner spore wall and an outer sporangium wall.|$|E
50|$|Cunninghamella echinulata is {{a member}} of the family, Cunninghamellaceae (phylum Mucormycota). This species is closely related to C. elegans, and both species share highly similar {{characteristics}} of growth and morphology. Colonies tend to be rapidly growing on most growth media producing a dense, white or greyish aerial mycelium. Cunninghamella echinulata reproduces asexually and solely via yellow-brown, spiny, single-spored sporangioles that, due to the nature of the <b>sporangiospore</b> being retained within the sporangium, appear to have a two-layered outer wall. This fungus grows by means of filaments that lack septa. This is a common feature of members if the Mucormycota where the hyphal compartments are either fully divided by septa or are completely continuous (coenocytic) and multinucleate. Zygospores of this fungus are only produced following the fusion of gametangia of compatible mating strains, exemplifying a heterothallic mating system. Sporangiophores of this species are irregularly branched and do not resemble the sporangiospores typical of most other members of the Mucormycota encountered in similar habitats. The sporangioles produced by this fungus are larger in size (10-20 μm) than those of the closely related species, C. elegans.|$|E

40|$|Germination of Rhizopus oligosporus <b>sporangiospores</b> is {{characterized}} by swelling of the spores and subsequent emergence of germ tubes. Changes in spore morphology and alterations in intracellular pH (pH(infin)) of the <b>sporangiospores</b> were assessed during the germination process by flow cytometry. <b>Sporangiospores</b> were stained with carboxyfluorescein by incubation with carboxyfluorescein diacetate. The nonfluorescent carboxyfluorescein diacetate is passively transported into intact cells and subsequently cleaved by esterases, which results in intracellular accumulation of the fluorescent carboxyfluorescein. Given that the fluorescence of carboxyfluorescein is pH dependent, the pH(infin) of the individual spores could be assessed simultaneously with spore size. For R. oligosporus, swelling of the <b>sporangiospores</b> was accompanied by an increase of pH(infin). In the presence of nonanoic acid, a self-inhibitor produced by various fungi, increase of the pH(infin) was prevented and swelling was inhibited at concentrations of less than 1 mM. Octanoic acid and decanoic acid were equally effective. Acetic acid also inhibited germination but at much higher concentrations (> 8 mM). The mechanism of action of these fatty acids is most likely dissipation of the pH gradient. A model is proposed in which the pH(infin) {{plays a crucial role}} in the germination of R. oligosporus <b>sporangiospores...</b>|$|R

40|$|Pinnules of sporophylles in Osmunda japonica were cultured stationarily at {{the bottom}} of the culture solution. After about a month, prothalia were crowded out through the walls of sporangia which {{appeared}} to be dead. Then, prothalia multiplied and grew up, and they formed eventually a cushionlike mass. At five. or six months after the inocula-tion, sporophytes of the next generation appeared on these cushionlike masses of prot-alia. These phenomena suggest Lhat the particular genetic information maintained in Osrnunda may be expressed. It may be similar to the genetic information contained in the first land plants, and they might express it in order to protect reproductive organs against the flood damage. This behavior, namely the <b>sporangiospore</b> germination in the Paleozoic land plants might be effective to protect reproductive organs against both the flood dam-age and the drought damage.

40|$|Mucor {{dimorphism}} has interested microbiologists {{since the}} time of Pasteur. When deprived of oxygen, these fungi grow as spherical, multipolar budding yeasts. In the presence of oxygen, they propagate as branching coenocytic hyphae. The ease with which these morphologies can be manipulated in the laboratory, the diverse array of morphopoietic agents available, and the alternative developmental fates that can be elicited from a single cell type (the <b>sporangiospore)</b> make Mucor spp. a highly propitious system in which to study eukaryotic cellular morphogenesis. The composition and organization of the cell wall differ greatly in Mucor yeasts and hyphae. The deposition of new wall polymers is isodiametric in yeasts and apically polarized in hyphae. Current research has focused on the identity and control of enzymes participating in wall synthesis. An understanding of how the chitosome interacts with appropriate effectors, specific enzymes, and the plasma membrane to assemble chitin-chitosan microfibrils and to deposit them at the proper sites on the cell exterior will be critical to elucidating dimorphism. Several biochemical and physiological parameters have been reported to fluctuate in a manner that correlates with Mucor morphogenesis. The literature describing these has been reviewed critically with the intent of distinguishing between causal and casual connections. The advancement of molecular genetics has afforded powerful new tools that researchers have begun to exploit in the study of Mucor dimorphism. Several genes, some encoding products known to correlate with development in Mucor spp. or other fungi, have been cloned, sequenced, and examined for transcriptional activity during morphogenesis. Most have appeared in multiple copies displaying independent transcriptional control. Selective translation of stored mRNA molecules occurs during <b>sporangiospore</b> germination. Many other correlates of Mucor morphogenesis, presently described but not yet explained, should prove amenable to analysis by the emerging molecular technology...|$|E

There was a hierarchy of substrates capable of initiating germination with glucose = mannose> xylose> glutamate> cellobiose. C-spores also differed from M-spores by initiating germination in the presence of the non-metabolizable glucose analogue 3 - 0 -methylglucose. These results suggest that at least two <b>sporangiospore</b> phenotypes are produced depending upon the concentration and type of ingredients present in the sporulation medium...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} investigation characterises {{the interaction}} between temperature and growth in psychrophilic, mesophilic and thermophilic fungi {{in order to gain}} further insight into the physiological mechanisms underlying fungal growth at extreme temperatures.

Subsequent investigations of plasma membrane permeability suggested that plasma membrane structure and function may be significant in establishing both the upper and lower growth temperature limits characteristic of psychrophiles, mesophiles and thermophiles. Analysis of the plasma membrane fractions revealed significant differences in membrane phospholipid composition between these thermal groups and it is suggested that the differing cardinal growth temperatures characteristic of psychrophilic, mesophilic and thermophilic fungi reflect the temperature ranges over which these organisms exhibit levels of plasma membrane fluidity sufficient to maintain membrane-associated growth processes. In contrast, the membrane protein components appear uniform in both character and thermostability and are therefore unlikely to contribute to this phenomenon...|$|E

40|$|Interation of cyclic AMP with {{a profoundly}} {{changing}} pattern of specific binding proteins was shown during aerobic germination of sporangiospores from the fungus Mucor racemosus. 32 P-labeled 8 -azido-cycli AMP, an analogue of cyclic AMP that forms a covalent linkage with the binding proteins under u. v. light, {{was used as}} the ligand. Binding proteins carrying this photoaffinity label were separated by polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and identified by radioautography. Equibiltrium dissociation constants (Kd) and binding-response curves in the presence of competing nucleotides were identical for both 8 -azido-cyclic [32 P]AMP and cyclic [3 H]AMP. A quantitative binding assay with both 8 -azido-cyclic [32 P]AMP and cyclic [3 H]AMP over the time course of <b>sporangiospore</b> germination indicated a parallel relationship between cyclic AMP-binding capacity and the intracellular concentrations of cyclic AMP reported in a previous study [Paznokas & Sypherd (1975) J.

The spores of both species abounded in cytosomes, corresponding in size, shape, and heavy-metal “stain” affinities to spherosomes in cells of higher plants. The osmiophilic response of these spherosome-like inclusions was intensified by treatment of sections with thiocarbohydrazide solution and subsequent application of aqueous osmium tetroxide, which strengthens an assumption that they are lipid-rich. The margins of the spherosome-like inclusions in lead citrate-stained sections included dense particles, about 60 A across, whose crystalline-like arrangements suggested that protein as well as lipid was present.

Zygospores have a light requirement for germination and were stimulated by KMnO 4, NaClO and H 2 O 2. Zygospore progeny from crosses between (+) and (-) isolates of g. cucurbitarum consisted of (+), (-) and (+,-) mating types. Mating types of germsporangiospores in each germsporangium were either all (+), or all (-) from respective (+) or (-) zygospore cultures and, all (+,-), or (+) and/or (-) plus (+,-) types from (+,-) zygospore cultures. Mating type heterokaryons (+,-) obtained from zygospore and germsporangiospore cultures in all crosses produced azygospores and zygospores which segregated into (+) and (-) during asexual propagation. All the zygospore and germsporangiospore progenies from the cross between two fast growing isolates were of fast growing type, while all those from the crosses between two slow growing isolates were of slow growing type. The crosses between fast and slow growing isolates gave rise to progeny with both fast and slow growing types. Mating types of zygospore isolates from crosses between two near identical isolates followed 1 (+) : 1 (-) : 2 (+,-) ratio. The distribution of mating types (+) and (-), and growth types F and S fit a 1 : 1 ratio in zygospore progeny in all crosses.

40|$|Mucor circinelloides is a zygomycete fungus and an {{emerging}} opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised patients, especially transplant recipients {{and in some}} cases otherwise healthy individuals. We have discovered a novel example of size dimorphism linked to virulence. M. circinelloides is a heterothallic fungus: (+) sex allele encodes SexP and (-) sex allele SexM, both of which are HMG domain protein sex determinants. M. circinelloides f. lusitanicus (Mcl) (-) mating type isolates produce larger asexual <b>sporangiospores</b> that are more virulent in the wax moth host compared to (+) isolates that produce smaller less virulent <b>sporangiospores.</b> The larger <b>sporangiospores</b> germinate inside and lyse macrophages, whereas the smaller <b>sporangiospores</b> do not. sexMDelta mutants are sterile and still produce larger virulent <b>sporangiospores,</b> suggesting that either the sex locus is not involved in virulence/spore size or the sexP allele plays an inhibitory role. Phylogenetic analysis supports that at least three extant subspecies populate the M. circinelloides complex in nature: Mcl, M. circinelloides f. griseocyanus, and M. circinelloides f. circinelloides (Mcc). Mcc was found to be more prevalent among clinical Mucor isolates, and more virulent than Mcl in a diabetic murine model in contrast to the wax moth host. The M. circinelloides sex locus encodes an HMG domain protein (SexP for plus and SexM for minus mating types) flanked by genes encoding triose phosphate transporter (TPT) and RNA helicase homologs. The borders of the sex locus between the three subspecies differ: the Mcg sex locus includes the promoters of both the TPT and the RNA helicase genes, whereas the Mcl and Mcc sex locus includes only the TPT gene promoter. Mating between subspecies was restricted compared to mating within subspecies. These findings demonstrate that spore size dimorphism is linked to virulence of M. circinelloides species and that plasticity of the sex locus and adaptations in pathogenicity have occurred during speciation of the M. circinelloides complex.

Following screening of mutants induced by UV radiation, F 6, exhibiting delayed sporangium formation was selected because its sporan-gium maturation exhibited a 5 -day delay without significant loss of mycelial weight com-pared to the wild type. The sporangium-free mycelial mattress from the <b>sporangiospore</b> culture of F 6 was treated with 1 N sodium hydroxide NaOH at 85 °C for 2 h to produce a sponge-like membrane named Rhizochitin. The trifluoroacetic acid hydrolysate of Rhizochi-tin contained 36 % N-acetylglucosamine and 53 % hexose respectively detected by the Elson-Morgen and phenol-sulfuric acid methods. Results indicated the wound area in rats covered with Rhizochitin was 40 % {{less than that of}} the uncovered group. Rhizochitin decreased the expression of PDGF in the proliferation stage, increased the expression of TGF-β in the inflammation and proliferation stages, and increased the expression of VEGF in the inflammation and proliferation stages. Rhizochitin inhibited secretion of matrix metal-loproteinase- 9 on days 1, 7, 9, and 12 and matrix metalloproteinase- 2 on days 3, 7, 9, and 12. It was concluded that Rhizochitin has beneficial properties of biocompatible, biodegrad-able, and wound healing...|$|E
50|$|Mucoralean fungi are {{typically}} fast-growing, and their wide hyphae lack septa (multiperforate septa are present only in sporangiophores and gametangia). The hyphae grow mostly within the substrate. Sporangiophores are upright (simple or ramified) hyphae that support sac-like sporangia filled with asexual <b>sporangiospores.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>sporangiospores</b> are asexual mitospores (formed via mitosis) {{that are}} {{produced}} inside sporangia (thousands of spores) or sporangioles (single or few spores). They are released when mature by {{the disintegration of}} the sporangium wall, or as a whole sporangiole that separates from the sporangiophore.|$|R
