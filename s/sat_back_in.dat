2500|$|In {{addition}} to Josephine's concealing Wyatt's past relationship with Blaylock, modern researchers think she {{may also have}} been trying to conceal her own past as a [...] "sporting lady" [...] or prostitute. While prostitutes were ostracized by [...] "respectable" [...] women, many madams and prostitutes had more control of their lives and greater independence than other women. Josephine always sought excitement in her life. In the book I Married Wyatt Earp (1967), based on a manuscript which she purportedly wrote, author Glenn Boyer quotes her as saying, [...] "I liked the traveling sort of man... better than the kind that <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> one town all his life and wrote down little rows of figures all day or hustled dry goods or groceries and that sort of thing... My blood demanded excitement, variety and change." [...] The type of work available to most women in that era was as laundresses, seamstresses, or other dull work which Josephine avoided.|$|E
2500|$|A four-rider move {{initially}} got {{clear in}} the opening kilometres of the stage, but they were brought back before [...] of the parcours had been completed. After that, a larger group consisting of sixteen riders, including the four-time defending mountains classification winner David Moncoutié (...) and fourth stage winner Simon Clarke of [...] advanced forward. With members of their respective teams in the breakaway as well, Joaquim Rodríguez's [...] squad and the [...] of Alejandro Valverde, <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the peloton and allowed [...] and [...] to control the pace for their respective protected riders Alberto Contador and Chris Froome. The leaders held a lead of over three minutes at one point, with the break splitting apart on the Alto Folgueiras de Aigas, and on the descent, Alberto Losada – Rodríguez's team-mate in the break – ventured off the front on his own. The peloton had reduced the gap to two minutes by this point, and were continuing {{to close the gap}} gradually as they reached the bottom of the final climb of the stage.|$|E
60|$|Beatrice <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> {{her chair}} {{as though she}} had been struck.|$|E
60|$|The {{scratching}} ceased, and the mate, grinning broadly, {{resumed his}} dinner. He finished at last, and lighting his pipe <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> easily <b>in</b> the locker watching the door {{out of the}} corner of his eye.|$|R
60|$|The guest seemed {{helpless}} {{to take his}} gaze from it, and he <b>sat</b> fallen <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair at it when the woman {{came in with a}} pie.|$|R
60|$|The coachman <b>sat</b> looking <b>back,</b> whip <b>in</b> hand, {{ready for}} an instant start.|$|R
60|$|Sir Patrick <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair, and {{stretched}} out his legs luxuriously.|$|E
60|$|She <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> {{her chair}} and {{regarded}} his pinched and determined visage.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Wilding <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair, {{and looked}} at him, his face inexpressibly shocked.|$|E
6000|$|... "So you've found her, have you?" [...] Ruby exclaimed, {{her face}} turned towards Deane, her finger outstretched to where Winifred <b>sat</b> {{shrinking}} <b>back</b> <b>in</b> her chair. [...] "Thieves, both of you! Thieves! Thieves!" ...|$|R
60|$|Sharkey had <b>sat</b> leaning <b>back</b> <b>in</b> {{his chair}} with a ghastly face while {{he listened to the}} surgeon's words. He mopped himself with his red handkerchief, and wiped away the fatal dust with which he was smeared.|$|R
2500|$|... as strangers went by. [...] We {{stopped by}} a cabin and inquired of an aged woman who <b>sat</b> leaning <b>back</b> <b>in</b> a {{homemade}} hickory chair with {{her feet on the}} rail, how far it was to Greenbriar, which had been designated to us ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Templeton <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair, frowning; {{but more}} from utter bewilderment now than anger.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Fentolin <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair. His {{long fingers}} played nervously together, {{he looked at}} her gravely.|$|E
60|$|The Governor <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> {{his chair}} with a grunt. His secretary, on his {{immediate}} right, leaned towards him.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Chalk <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> helplessly <b>in</b> {{her chair}} and gazed from her husband to Captain Brisket, and from Captain Brisket back to her husband. Captain Brisket, red-faced and confident, sat upright {{on the edge of}} his chair as though {{inviting}} inspection; Mr. Chalk plucked nervously at his fingers. Captain Bowers suddenly broke silence.|$|R
60|$|Ray Cowles and Howard Griffin, {{those great}} seniors, <b>sat</b> tilted <b>back</b> <b>in</b> wooden chairs, and {{between them was}} {{the lord of the}} world, Mr. Bjorken, the {{football}} coach, a large, amiable, rather religious young man, who believed in football, foreign missions, and the Democratic party.|$|R
60|$|A strong {{smell of}} tobacco {{showed that the}} {{diagnosis}} had been a true one. Each of the figures in turn lit his pipe at the candle, and <b>sat</b> <b>back,</b> still <b>in</b> silence. It {{could not have been}} very pleasant, smoking in almost pitch darkness, but it was breaking rules, which was probably the main consideration that swayed the smokers. They puffed away steadily, till the two Irishmen were wrapped about in invisible clouds.|$|R
60|$|He <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> {{his chair}} {{and looked at the}} girl in amazement. She was rather young to have {{conceived}} such ideas.|$|E
60|$|He <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair, {{and meeting}} the other's hatred with a gaze as steady as his own, {{replaced}} his pistol.|$|E
60|$|Mamie {{handed him}} her note. He read {{it without a}} word. When he had {{finished}} he <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair, thinking.|$|E
6000|$|Pat's face {{suddenly}} sobered {{and rising}} {{to his feet}} he strode over to where Upton <b>sat</b> tilted <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair, {{his feet on the}} desk, and swung a big fist, hard as nails, perilously close to Upton's nose. [...] "Take ut back, ye little spalpeen," [...] he commanded. [...] "Take ut back and tell me ye loike me betther for what I am than for what I was!" ...|$|R
60|$|From {{his seat}} by Mrs. Septimus Small Soames was watching. He {{had a reason}} of his own {{connected}} with a pet building scheme, for observing Bosinney. The architect might do for his purpose; he looked clever, as he <b>sat</b> leaning <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair, moodily making little ramparts with bread-crumbs. Soames noted his dress clothes to be well cut, but too small, as though made many years ago.|$|R
50|$|On 12 July 2016, APOEL {{endured a}} {{frustrating}} opening Champions League campaign after being {{held to a}} 0-0 draw against The New Saints in their first leg tie in Wales. Thomas Christiansen's side dominated possession and missed decent chances to score against a stubborn TNS side that <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> and defended <b>in</b> numbers for 90 minutes.|$|R
60|$|Strong {{as was his}} composure, {{the lawyer}} <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair {{with a sort of}} solid stupefaction at which Paynter could not help smiling.|$|E
60|$|No more did the {{financier}} {{reveal his}} own feelings. He still <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair, unmoved, in apparent contemplation. The posture was familiar to Langmaid.|$|E
60|$|The master <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> {{his chair}} white and dumb. Incredible, extraordinary, and utterly unlooked for as was this revelation, he felt instinctively {{that it was}} true.|$|E
50|$|Afterwards, {{the three}} boys put a bloodied Warren in Parker's car. Parker drove and Shoemaker {{sat in the}} front seat while Jared <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>back</b> with Warren. Warren was still {{conscious}} enough to repeatedly ask to be taken home.|$|R
50|$|In a nine-horse field, Little Current <b>sat</b> nine lengths <b>back</b> <b>in</b> eighth {{place while}} Kentucky Derby winner Cannonade and Jolly Johu dueled for the lead. Making the turn for home, again Little Current came {{storming}} through {{to run away}} from the pack and score another seven-length win.|$|R
60|$|The {{front part}} of the shipping-office on Atlantic Avenue was a glass-inclosed room {{littered}} with chairs, piles of circulars, old pictures of Cunarders, older calendars, and directories to be ranked as antiques. In the midst of these remains a red-headed Yankee of forty, smoking a Pittsburg stogie, <b>sat</b> tilted <b>back</b> <b>in</b> a kitchen chair, reading the Boston American. Mr. Wrenn delivered M. Baraieff's letter and stood waiting, holding his suit-case, ready to skip out and go aboard a cattle-boat immediately.|$|R
60|$|Almost at {{the same}} time the Prince <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the shadows of the Duchess of Devenham's box at the Opera and talked quietly to Lady Grace.|$|E
60|$|Having concluded, Monsieur de Garnache <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair, {{and threw}} one {{leg over the}} other, fixing his eyes upon the Seneschal's face and {{awaiting}} his reply.|$|E
60|$|Trenchard {{replenished}} it {{with the}} utmost promptness, then <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his tall chair and pulled a moment at the fresh pipe with which he had equipped himself.|$|E
6000|$|He saw {{the priest}} bend down and kiss {{the altar and}} then face about and bless all the people. All crossed {{themselves}} and stood up. Mr Bloom glanced about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats. Stand up at the gospel of course. Then all settled down on their knees again and he <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> quietly <b>in</b> his bench. The priest {{came down from the}} altar, holding the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered each other in Latin. Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a card: ...|$|R
50|$|Oman coach Paul Le Guen made attacking {{replacements}} in {{the final}} half hour by bringing on Al-Hosni and Mohsin Al-Khaldi {{in an attempt to}} restore parity and on 76th minutes Al-Muqbali had a golden chance to equalize when Ali Al-Busaidi picked him out all alone in the penalty area but the forward's first touch was poor and South Korea cleared their lines. The West Asians continued to put in an improved performance thereafter as South Korea <b>sat</b> <b>back,</b> and <b>in</b> stoppage time Al-Hosni's goal-bound header from a corner was dramatically touched onto the crossbar by Kim Jin-hyeon as Uli Stielike's side narrowly escaped to take all three points.|$|R
60|$|Lilian <b>sat</b> leaning <b>back</b> <b>in</b> {{a basket}} chair, {{shrouded}} from observation by two tall aloe plants, {{with her face}} still turned toward the cost of Africa. The silver shimmer faded from off the sea, the fires of sunset died out behind the cordillera, but Mrs. Chatterton did not return, and her niece waited with hands crossed idly in her lap. It was now some time since the steamer's anchor had rattled down. Presently, because the long windows behind her were open, she started at {{a voice in the}} adjoining room. It seemed the voice of one risen from the dead.|$|R
