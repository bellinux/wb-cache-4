25|$|In February 2007 the California Building <b>Standards</b> <b>Code</b> was updated {{to approve}} the use of {{chlorinated}} polyvinyl chloride (CPVC) pipe for use in residential water supply piping systems. CPVC has been a nationally accepted material in the U.S. since 1982; California, however, has permitted only limited use since 2001. The Department of Housing and Community Development prepared and certified an environmental impact statement resulting in a recommendation that the commission adopt and approve the use of CPVC. The commission's vote was unanimous, and CPVC has been placed in the 2007 California Plumbing Code.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The <b>standard</b> genetic <b>code</b> table has a {{distinctly}} non-random structure, with similar amino acids often encoded by codons series that differ {{by a single}} nucleotide substitution, typically, in the third or the first position of the codon. It has been repeatedly argued that this structure of the code results from selective optimization for robustness to translation errors such that translational misreading has the minimal adverse effect. Indeed, {{it has been shown}} in several studies that the <b>standard</b> <b>code</b> is more robust than a substantial majority of random codes. However, it remains unclear how much evolution the <b>standard</b> <b>code</b> underwent, what is the level of optimization, and what is the likely starting point. Results We explored possible evolutionary trajectories of the genetic code within a limited domain of the vast space of possible codes. Only those codes were analyzed for robustness to translation error that possess the same block structure and the same degree of degeneracy as the <b>standard</b> <b>code.</b> This choice of {{a small part of the}} vast space of possible codes is based on the notion that the block structure of the <b>standard</b> <b>code</b> is a consequence of the structure of the complex between the cognate tRNA and the codon in mRNA where the third base of the codon plays a minimum role as a specificity determinant. Within this part of the fitness landscape, a simple evolutionary algorithm, with elementary evolutionary steps comprising swaps of four-codon or two-codon series, was employed to investigate the optimization of codes for the maximum attainable robustness. The properties of the <b>standard</b> <b>code</b> were compared to the properties of four sets of codes, namely, purely random codes, random codes that are more robust than the <b>standard</b> <b>code,</b> and two sets of codes that resulted from optimization of the first two sets. The comparison of these sets of <b>codes</b> with the <b>standard</b> <b>code</b> and its locally optimized version showed that, on average, optimization of random codes yielded evolutionary trajectories that converged at the same level of robustness to translation errors as the optimization path of the standard code; however, the <b>standard</b> <b>code</b> required considerably fewer steps to reach that level than an average random code. When evolution starts from random codes whose fitness is comparable to that of the <b>standard</b> <b>code,</b> they typically reach much higher level of optimization than the <b>standard</b> <b>code,</b> i. e., the <b>standard</b> <b>code</b> is much closer to its local minimum (fitness peak) than most of the random codes with similar levels of robustness. Thus, the <b>standard</b> genetic <b>code</b> appears to be a point on an evolutionary trajectory from a random point (code) about half the way to the summit of the local peak. The fitness landscape of code evolution appears to be extremely rugged, containing numerous peaks with a broad distribution of heights, and the <b>standard</b> <b>code</b> is relatively unremarkable, being located on the slope of a moderate-height peak. Conclusion The <b>standard</b> <b>code</b> appears to be the result of partial optimization of a random code for robustness to errors of translation. The reason the code is not fully optimized could be the trade-off between the beneficial effect of increasing robustness to translation errors and the deleterious effect of codon series reassignment that becomes increasingly severe with growing complexity of the evolving system. Thus, evolution of the code can be represented as a combination of adaptation and frozen accident.
