25|$|Note that {{lines are}} deemed {{to start at}} EAV, whereas sample zero is the sample {{following}} SAV. This produces the somewhat confusing result that the first sample in a given line of 1080i video is sample number 1920 (the first EAV sample in that format), and the line ends at the following sample 1919 (the last active sample in that format). Note that this behavior differs somewhat from analog video interfaces, where the line transition is deemed to occur at the <b>sync</b> <b>pulse,</b> which occurs roughly halfway through the horizontal blanking region.|$|E

The horizontal sync signal is a single short pulse which indicates the start of every line.

5000|$|In {{an analog}} {{receiver}} with a CRT display <b>sync</b> <b>pulses</b> are fed to {{horizontal and vertical}} timebase circuits (commonly called [...] "sweep circuits" [...] in the United States), each consisting of an oscillator and an amplifier. These generate modified sawtooth and parabola current waveforms to scan the electron beam in a linear way. The waveform shapes are necessary {{to make up for}} the distance variations from the electron beam source and the screen surface. The oscillators are designed to free-run at frequencies very close to the field and line rates, but the <b>sync</b> <b>pulses</b> cause them to reset at the beginning of each scan line or field, resulting in the necessary synchronization of the beam sweep with the originating signal. The output waveforms from the timebase amplifiers are fed to the horizontal and vertical deflection coils wrapped around the CRT tube. These coils produce magnetic fields proportional to the changing current, and these deflect the electron beam across the screen.|$|R
5000|$|The {{output power}} of a TV {{transmitter}} is the electric power applied to antenna system.There are two definitions: nominal (or peak) and thermal. Analogue television systems put about 70% to 90% of the transmitters power into the <b>sync</b> <b>pulses.</b> The remainder of the transmitter's power goes into transmitting the video's higher frequencies and the FM audio carrier. Digital television modulation systems are about 30% more efficient than analogue modulation systems overall.|$|R
50|$|The {{sampling}} (digitising) {{of standard}} definition video was defined in Rec. 601 in 1982. In this standard, the existing analogue video signals are sampled at 13.5 MHz. Thus {{the number of}} active video pixels per line {{is equal to the}} sample rate multiplied by the active line duration (the part of each analogue video line that contains active video, that is to say that it does not contain <b>sync</b> <b>pulses,</b> blanking, etc.).|$|R

50|$|The {{standard}} {{video signal}} (or more precisely composite video signal) is a signal {{with a maximum}} level of 1 volt into 75 Ω. In this signal 0.3 volt corresponds to black and 1 volt corresponds to white. The 0.0 volt to 0.3 volt range is reserved for the <b>sync</b> <b>pulses.</b> Video circuits are designed around these limits. These limits apply to recording on analogue video tape and analogue transmission {{as well as in}} analogue to digital video converters.|$|R
5000|$|The video {{bandwidth}} is 5.0 MHz. The {{video signal}} modulates the carrier by Amplitude Modulation. But {{a portion of}} the lower side band is suppressed. This technique is known as vestigial side band modulation (AC3). The polarity of modulation is negative, meaning that an increase in the instantaneous brightness of the video signal results in a decrease in RF power and vice versa. Specifically, the <b>sync</b> <b>pulses</b> (being [...] "blacker than black") result in maximum power from the transmitter.|$|R
50|$|Another {{advantage}} of negative modulation is that, since the synchronizing pulses represent maximum carrier power, {{it is relatively}} easy to arrange the receiver automatic gain control to only operate during <b>sync</b> <b>pulses</b> and thus get a constant amplitude video signal to drive the rest of the TV set. This was not possible for many years with positive modulation as the peak carrier power varied depending on picture content. Modern digital processing circuits have achieved a similar effect but using the front porch of the video signal.|$|R
5000|$|To {{measure the}} nominal output power, {{measuring}} devices with time constants {{much greater than}} the line time are used. So the measuring equipment's measure only the highest level (<b>sync</b> <b>pulse)</b> of a line waveform which is [...] 100%.|$|E
5000|$|In 1973, the one-pulse-per-frame {{technique}} {{was used to}} control recording directly onto sprocketed magnetic film in the Super8 Sound Recorder.

50|$|Vertical {{synchronization}} (also called {{vertical sync}} or VSync) separates the video fields. In PAL and NTSC, the vertical <b>sync</b> <b>pulse</b> occurs within the vertical blanking interval. The vertical sync pulses {{are made by}} prolonging the length of HSYNC pulses through almost {{the entire length of}} the scan line.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{systems were}} mechanical television systems, which used spinning disks with patterns of holes punched into the disc to scan an image. A similar disk reconstructed the image at the receiver. Synchronization of the receiver disc rotation was handled through <b>sync</b> <b>pulses</b> broadcast {{with the image}} information. However these mechanical systems were slow, the images were dim and flickered severely, and the image resolution very low. Camera systems used similar spinning discs and required intensely bright illumination of the subject for the light detector to work.|$|R
50|$|The use of AM (rather than FM) {{for sound}} {{and the use of}} {{positive}} (rather than negative) video modulation made 405-line signals very prone to visible impulse interference, such as that generated by the ignition systems of vehicles. Such interference manifested itself as a loud popping on sound and large bright spots on the picture, which viewers found much more noticeable than the dark spots encountered when such interference is encountered on a signal using negative video modulation. With positive modulation, interference could easily be of similar amplitude to the <b>sync</b> <b>pulses</b> (which were represented by 0-30% of the transmitter output). The early time-base circuits were less able to discriminate between the signals and the picture would break up. By contrast, in negative modulation <b>sync,</b> <b>pulses</b> represent peak transmitter output (70-100% output). As a result, impulse interference would cause visual dark spots before it was large enough to affect the synchronisation of the picture. If the interference was large enough, the picture was probably unwatchable anyway. The later introduction of flywheel sync circuits rendered the picture much more stable, but these could have alleviated some of the problems with positive modulation. Almost all television systems that succeeded the 405-line system adopted negative modulation for this reason alone.|$|R
50|$|The {{vertical}} sync signal {{is a series}} of much longer pulses, indicating {{the start of a new}} field. The <b>sync</b> <b>pulses</b> occupy the whole of line interval of a number of lines at the beginning and end of a scan; no picture information is transmitted during vertical retrace. The pulse sequence is designed to allow horizontal sync to continue during vertical retrace; it also indicates whether each field represents even or odd lines in interlaced systems (depending on whether it begins at the start of a horizontal line, or midway through).|$|R
