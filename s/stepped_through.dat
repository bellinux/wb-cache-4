5|$|The TARDIS materialises on a {{seemingly}} derelict spaceship drifting in space. The Doctor, Rose, and Mickey explore {{the ship and}} are puzzled to find an eighteenth-century French fireplace. When he looks through the fireplace, the Doctor sees a young girl and asks who she is. She replies that her name is Reinette and that she lives in Paris in 1727. The Doctor deduces that the fireplace is a time window, a device that allows direct access to another time and place. The Doctor steps through the time window and arrives in Reinette's bedroom {{only to find that}} months have passed there. He discovers a ticking humanoid wearing eighteenth century clothing and a jester's mask hiding under Reinette's bed. After it threatens him with a saw-like device that slides out of its arm, the Doctor tricks the creature into returning through the time window to the spacecraft, where he and his companions learn that it is actually an intricate clockwork android. The android teleports away, and the Doctor warns Mickey and Rose not to go looking for it. The Doctor returns to Reinette's bedroom while Mickey and Rose arm themselves and go looking for the android. While trying to find Rose and Mickey, the Doctor discovers a horse that <b>stepped</b> <b>through</b> a time window, who he later names Arthur. Returning to Reinette's bedroom, the Doctor discovers that she is now a young woman. She flirts with the Doctor and they kiss, before she leaves to join her mother. The Doctor then realises that she is Madame de Pompadour, the mistress of King Louis XV.|$|E

25|$|These voltage {{changes on}} the trunk circuit would cause pops or clicks that were audible to the {{subscriber}} as the electrical handshaking <b>stepped</b> <b>through</b> its protocol. Another handshake, to start timing for billing purposes, caused {{a second set of}} clunks when the called party answered.|$|E
25|$|In two-way trunks with E and M signaling, a {{handshake}} took place to prevent both switches from colliding by dialing {{calls on the}} same trunk at the same time. By changing the state of these leads from ground to -48 volts, the switches <b>stepped</b> <b>through</b> {{a handshake}} protocol. Using DC voltage changes, the local switch would send a signal {{to get ready for}} a call and the remote switch would reply with an acknowledgment to go ahead with dial pulsing. This was done with relay logic and discrete electronics.|$|E
500|$|University of Missouri Tigers coach Tim Jamieson {{spotted him}} in a summer league, and {{convinced}} him to head east for his junior year. Jamieson said, [...] "I saw him take ground balls and thought, defensively, he was as good a middle infielder as I had ever seen. As for his bat, I didn't really care." [...] While there, Kinsler had a [...]335 batting average, [...]416 on-base percentage, and [...]536 slugging percentage, with 16 steals in 17 attempts. He {{was named to the}} All-Big 12 Conference second team. Jamieson noted, [...] "From the day Ian <b>stepped</b> <b>through</b> the doors here, you could see it on his face: He was on a mission." ...|$|E

500|$|In the west, the Union {{troops had}} fallen {{back to the}} Seminary and built hasty breastworks running [...] north-south before the western face of Schmucker Hall, bolstered by 20 guns of Wainwright's battalion. Dorsey Pender's {{division}} of Hill's Corps <b>stepped</b> <b>through</b> the exhausted lines of Heth's men at about 4:00 p.m. to finish off the I Corps survivors. The brigade of Brig. Gen. Alfred M. Scales attacked first, on the northern flank. His five regiments of 1,400 North Carolinians were virtually annihilated {{in one of the}} fiercest artillery barrages of the war, rivaling Pickett's Charge to come, but on a more concentrated scale. Twenty guns spaced only [...] apart fired spherical case, explosive shells, canister, and double canister rounds into the approaching brigade, which emerged from the fight with only 500 men standing and a single lieutenant in command. Scales wrote afterwards that he found [...] "only a squad here and there marked the place where regiments had rested." ...|$|E

[...] As soon as Zorig <b>stepped</b> <b>through</b> the door they jumped him, {{stabbing}} him sixteen times, including three stab wounds to the heart. Strangely, they stole {{a bottle of}} vinegar {{and a bottle of}} soy sauce from the refrigerator before fleeing the apartment. [...] Four days after the murder, mourners crowded Sukhbaatar Square, holding candlelight vigils. His body lay in the Government House before his burial on Wednesday, October 7. [...] The government crisis lingered for another two months until Janlavyn Narantsatsralt, the mayor of Ulaanbaatar, was finally named the new Prime Minister in December 1998.|$|E
2500|$|Although Warrior's {{relationship}} with WWE was strained at times, more recently WWE has recognized {{him as one}} of the legends of the company. WWE described him as being [...] "As devastating and intense as any Superstar who <b>stepped</b> <b>through</b> the ropes...", further saying that [...] "The Ultimate Warrior may be the most enigmatic man to ever hold the WWE Championship." [...] In 2011, WWE called him [...] "one of the most recognizable" [...] wrestlers in WWE history, praising his ability to draw power from [...] "the WWE Universe", and further spoke of his impact as having [...] "brought Hulkamania to its knees" [...] at WrestleMania VI, [...] "retired the Madness at WrestleMania VII and press slammed a slew of the greatest legends of his era". In WWE All Stars, in which Ultimate Warrior appears as one of the Legends, WWE stated that he was the [...] "ultimate archetype of strength and intensity", and further stated that [...] "without question, the Ultimate Warrior has etched his name in the pantheon of WWE greats".|$|E

2500|$|He {{has shown}} a {{resistance}} to temporal effects and has demonstrated telepathic ability, both the ability to mentally connect to other incarnations of himself he encountered (The Five Doctors), {{and an ability to}} enter into the memories of other individuals ("The Girl in the Fireplace"). He can apparently reverse this process, sharing his memory with another, as shown in [...] "The Big Bang". Some humans can enter the Doctor's memories after he enters theirs, as demonstrated by Madame de Pompadour (much to the Doctor's surprise) in [...] "The Girl in the Fireplace", when she explains, [...] "A door, once opened, may be <b>stepped</b> <b>through</b> in either direction." [...] In [...] "The Fires of Pompeii", the Doctor reveals that he is able to perceive the fabric of time, discerning [...] "fixed points" [...] and [...] "points in flux" [...] – moments when history must remain as it was originally versus moments when he can change or influence the original course of events, as well as all past, present and possible future events. However, in [...] "Kill the Moon", the Twelfth Doctor claims that there are [...] "grey areas", points in time for which he cannot see the outcome. [...] Like many other alien species in the programme, the Doctor is able to sense when his own species is within proximity through an inherent telepathic connection.|$|E
