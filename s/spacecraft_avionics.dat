40|$|<b>Spacecraft</b> <b>avionics</b> {{initially}} {{commanded the}} development of the microprocessor industry, enabling microprocessors to be designed specifically for the reliability demands posed by the radiation environment of space. However, microprocessor have shifted their focus from ensuring reliable operations to maximizing performance, forcing the price of <b>spacecraft</b> <b>avionics</b> to balloon. Costing over three orders of magnitude more than current state of the art general purpose processors, while performing operations an order of magnitude slower. These differences stem from the reliability requirements of operating in space, typically achieved through hardware-based modifications. While these solutions generate the necessary reliability, they limit the engineering options for the system and force the use of outdated technology. A solution researched but never widely implemented, is the use of error detection and correction software algorithms. An ideal design lies in the combination of hardware and software methods for providing reliability. A new avionics architecture was designed to implement a system using hardware and software to achieve reliability with COTS products. The architecture was applied to the CASTOR satellite as its primary avionics system, for verification testing of the architecture's functionality.

The combination of long mission duration with no quick emergency return option leads to unprecedented spacecraft system safety and reliability requirements. It is important that <b>spacecraft</b> <b>avionics</b> systems for human deep space {{missions are}} not susceptible to Single Event Effect (SEE) failures caused by space radiation (primarily the continuous galactic cosmic ray background and the occasional solar particle event) interactions with electronic components and systems. SEE effects are typically managed during the design, development, and test (DD&T) phase of spacecraft development by using heritage hardware (if possible) and through extensive component level testing, followed by system level failure analysis tasks that are both time consuming and costly. The ultimate product of the SEE DD&T program is a prediction of <b>spacecraft</b> <b>avionics</b> reliability in the flight environment produced using various nuclear reaction and transport codes {{in combination with the}} component and subsystem level radiation test data. Previous work by Koontz, et al. 1 utilized FLUKA, a Monte Carlo nuclear reaction and transport code, to calculate SEE and single event upset (SEU) rates. This code was then validated against in-flight data for a variety of spacecraft and space flight environments. However, FLUKA has a long run-time (on the order of days). CREME 962, an easy to use deterministic code offering short run times, was also compared with FLUKA predictions and in-flight data. CREME 96, though fast and easy to use, has not been updated in several years and underestimates secondary particle shower effects in spacecraft structural shielding mass. Thus, this paper will investigate the use of HZETRN 20103, a fast and easy to use deterministic transport code, similar to CREME 96, that was developed at NASA Langley Research Center primarily for flight crew ionizing radiation dose assessments.

40|$|A {{proposed}} {{approach to}} the development of software for <b>spacecraft</b> <b>avionics</b> is based partly on a concept of generic software that could be tailored to satisfy requirements for specific missions. The proposed approach would stand in contrast to the conventional approach of first defining avionics requirements for a specific mission, then developing software specific to those requirements. The proposed approach might also be adaptable to programming computers that control and monitor other complex equipment systems that range in scale from automobiles to factories. The concept of a <b>spacecraft</b> <b>avionics</b> functional model (SAFM) is a major element of the proposed approach. An SAFM would be, essentially, a systematic and hierarchical description of the functionality required of the avionics software (and hardware) for a given mission.

The resulting low-level version of the model would be used to develop a set of generic requirements that could be expected to include a large fraction of all requirements for a large fraction of all missions.

Monte Carlo nuclear reaction and transport codes such as FLUKA can be used to generate very accurate models of the expected in-flight radiation environment for SEE analyses. A major downside to using a Monte Carlo-based code is that the run times can be very long (on the order of days). A more popular choice for SEE calculations is the CREME 96 deterministic code, which offers significantly shorter run times (on the order of seconds). However, CREME 96, though fast and easy to use, has not been updated in several years and underestimates secondary particle shower effects in spacecraft structural shielding mass. Another modeling option to consider is the deterministic code HZETRN 20104, which includes updates to address secondary particle shower effects more accurately.

40|$|It {{has been}} 30 {{years since the}} National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) last {{developed}} a crewed spacecraft capable of launch, on-orbit operations, and landing. During that time, aerospace avionics technologies have greatly advanced in capability, and these technologies have enabled integrated avionics architectures for aerospace applications. The inception of NASA s Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) spacecraft offers the opportunity to leverage the latest integrated avionics technologies into crewed space vehicle architecture. The outstanding question is to what extent to implement these advances in avionics while still meeting the unique crewed spaceflight requirements for safety, reliability and maintainability. Historically, aircraft and spacecraft have very similar avionics requirements. Both aircraft and spacecraft must have high reliability. They also must have as much computing power as possible and provide low latency between user control and effecter response while minimizing weight, volume, and power. However, there are several key differences between aircraft and <b>spacecraft</b> <b>avionics.</b> Typically, the overall spacecraft operational time is much shorter than aircraft operation time, but the typical mission time (and hence, the time between preventive maintenance) is longer for a spacecraft than an aircraft. Also, the radiation environment is typically more severe for spacecraft than aircraft. A "loss of mission" scenario (i. e. - the mission is not a success, {{but there are no}} casualties) arguably has a greater impact on a multi-million dollar spaceflight mission than a typical commercial flight. Such differences need to be weighted when determining if an aircraft-like integrated modular avionics (IMA) system is suitable for a crewed spacecraft. This paper will explore the preliminary design process of the Orion vehicle avionics system by first identifying the Orion driving requirements and the difference between Orion requirements and those of other previous crewed <b>spacecraft</b> <b>avionics</b> systems. Common systems engineering methods will be used to evaluate the value propositions, or the factors that weight most heavily in design consideration, of Orion and other aerospace systems. Then, the current Orion avionics architecture will be presented and evaluated...|$|E
