A literature search was conducted using Medline, Cinahl, Helmis, Psychlit, Dhdata, and the database of the King's Fund in London for articles published up to June 2001, using the phrase "organizational culture. " In addition, all citations and the gray literature were reviewed and advice was sought from {{experts in the field}} to identify instruments not found on the electronic databases. The search focused on instruments used to quantify culture with a track record, or potential for use, in health care settings. DATA EXTRACTION. For each instrument we examined the cultural dimensions addressed, the number of items for each questionnaire, the measurement scale adopted, examples of studies that had used the tool, the <b>scientific</b> <b>properties</b> of the instrument, and its strengths and limitations. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS. Thirteen instruments were found that satisfied our inclusion criteria, of which nine have a track record in studies involving health care organizations.

Depending on when a Hh inhibiting compound is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), there may be a perceived need for one to be differentiated over another for marketing purposes, which could lead to different nomenclature (e.g., a Hhi or an agonist of Smo). This marketing technique is more of a differentiation strategy than a <b>scientific</b> <b>property</b> of these compounds, as the mechanism of action (MOA) in the end is inhibition of the Hh pathway, targeting cancer stem cells. However, as these new compounds are further studied, identification of differences in a compound's MOA, could lead to hypotheses regarding the stage at which Smo is inhibited, where along the pathway the compound binds, or specific binding properties of a compound. If these hypotheses are proven, claims could be made regarding a specific compound's MOA and how it affects efficacy, safety, combinability with other cancer treatments, etc. Scientific data in support of such hypotheses have not been published to date.|$|E

40|$|Debates on "scientific property" {{happened}} during the interwar years. In 1921 the Confederation of Intellectual Workers and the French Union of Inventors proposed a project to improve the protection of scientists' rights on their discoveries to the International Commission of Intellectual Cooperation (ICIC). A report, published in 1923 by Italian Senator Francesco Ruffini, called for the recognition of specific intellectual property for scientific discovery, in addition to industrial property - which protects the technical invention - and the copyright. Between 1923 and 1927, consultations with governments and the representatives of industry took place and {{gave rise to a}} second report written by the French senator and lawyer Marcel Plaisant. Although less ambitious than Ruffini's draft, Plaisant's report was still criticized and received unfavorable opinions from more than two thirds of the forty countries that had given a response. The issue of scientific ownership declined in the early 1930 s and it disappeared with the global crisis. In 1946, however, the newly founded UNESCO seized the matter again. Despite the event and the issue's importance, few works have been devoted to this history. Only one conference by Soraya Boudia (2001) and an article by David Miller (2008). Paradoxically, the French reactions are not discussed in detail even though the debate on <b>scientific</b> <b>property</b> began in France and found strong echoes there afterward. Our aim is to illustrate how French scientists were led to claim a proper right on their findings thanks to a strong involvement in transnational institutions. By crossing archives of international organizations (UNESCO and Leage of Nations archives) with national sources we will highlight the international circulation of the concept of <b>scientific</b> <b>property</b> and its adaptation to various national contexts. L'objet de cette communication est de mettre en regard les débats français et les débats transnationaux sur la propriété scientifique pour évaluer le rôle qu'ont joué les savants français qui y furent engagés.

40|$|Teresa Davis, Princeton University Universalism at the Margins: Codifying International Law in South America, 1889 - 1930 Between 1888 and 1928 the American {{continent}} saw widespread mobilization amongst North and South American jurists to codify private international law, that is, the set {{of rules}} and conventions governing the international relationships between private persons [...] whether individuals or corporations [...] and between these persons and the state. Coming as it did {{at a moment of}} increasing expansion of US trade and investment in Latin America, this was perhaps the world 2 ̆ 7 s first conversation between 2 ̆ 2 north 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 south 2 ̆ 2 over the rules governing the international economy. As such, the intellectual debates over private international law that took place across the Americas in this period raise key questions about the relationship between international mobility, sovereignty and economic development. At the center of the debate was the encounter between a utopian, 2 ̆ 2 scientific 2 ̆ 2 vision of a universal code, promoted by jurists affiliated with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, on the one hand, and, on the other, projects which sought to preserve a wide margin of sovereign power, even as they strove to promote investment and trade through the gradual establishment of clear international rules.

40|$|Aim The {{prevalence}} of orofacial pain {{is reported to}} be around 20 %. The most common location is intraoral, including recurrent and persistent pain conditions. Clinical signs and symptoms have been reported to overlap between nociceptive and neuropathic pain conditions, leading to difficulties in differential diagnosis.

40|$|The drug taxol {{has been}} hailed {{by many in}} the cancer {{community}} as a major breakthrough in the treatment of cancer. It has already been approved in use against ovarian and advanced breast cancer in many countries world-wide. Taxol has also promoted profound debates in the policy arena not, as one might expect, because of the characteristics or purposes of the drug itself, but because of other far-reaching effects. Taxol is a complex compound found in the bark of the Pacific yew tree, primarily in Oregon and Washington in the USA. The bark was first collected in 1962 and cytotoxicity demonstrated in 1964. Yet it was not until 1989 that the first results of clinical trials were reported. In the US taxol was then rushed through the Food and Drug Administration's regulatory procedures, approval being granted for use in refractory ovarian cancer in 1992. The controversies surrounding taxol surfaced in 1989 and grew substantially over the next few years. In this paper we examine two principal controversies concerning taxol, the first of which focused on apparent conflicts between the needs of environmental protection and those of cancer chemotherapy. Although the media portrayed this as a clash of interests between the environment and people with cancer, we argue that it was an attempt to increase lay participation in biomedical decision making and policy formulation. The second controversy was between health policy and the transfer of public <b>scientific</b> <b>property</b> to the corporate sector. The pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb was given exclusive rights to provide taxol from Pacific yew trees under a Co-operative Research and Development Agreement signed in 1991. While this was seen to be in the US Government's (as well as the company's) interest, it provoked a public reaction questioning the terms and consequences of the transfer of publicly generated scientific knowledge to the private sector.

If the early 1980 s and {{the adoption of the}} Bayh -Dole Act in the United States are considered as a turning point, the use of the intellectual property rights by scientific organizations have {{to be taken into account}} in the long term, by integrating both discourses and practice. Besides, the US situation has to be put into perspective by considering other countries. Our paper analyzes how the intellectual property – and more precisely the patent – was managed by the French scientific institutions during the inter -war period, when new research organisations were created,like the French National Center of Scientific Research (CNRS), and when the patent systems became progressively based on a corporate conception. Was the scientific patenting an essential element of this new process of scientific institutionalization ? How the French scientific institutions could be compared to other countries – the USA for instance – were patent policies were adopted by the universities as soon as the 1910 s- 1920 s ?At first, we will try to know who were the French scientists, taking some patents, focusing our attention on the case of the French physicist Paul Langevin. Then we will remind the main features of the debates about the <b>scientific</b> <b>property,</b> when scholars from different countries demanded to establish a specific kind of intellectual property rights about the scientific discoveries. We will confront these debates, in which some very famous French scientists like Marie Curie, Émile Borel ou Paul Langevin, were involved, to the actual practices of the various French research organizations at the same time. We will be particularly interested in the National Office for Scientific and Industrial Research and Inventions and the new CNRS, having to mention the patent strategy of Frederic Joliot about the nuclear energy.

40|$|SUMMARY Fatigue {{is among}} the most common and {{disabling}} symptoms of multiple sclerosis. Clinicians usually assess fatigue by asking people to describe and rate their fatigue in a self-report instrument. This paper evaluates the clinical usefulness and the <b>scientific</b> <b>properties</b> of a selection of various self-report instruments for fatigue. To be selected, instruments had to assess fatigue or a related concept, have some published information on reliability and validity, be used in at least one clinical trial of fatigue with people with multiple sclerosis, and demonstrate validity in people with MS. Five fatigue specific scales and four subscales of quality of life instruments were selected and evaluated. In occupational therapy, the fatigue subscales or items of quality of life measurements give limited information about the quality of fatigue.

In this latter category, isomorphism classes of objects are exactly higher dimensional automata up to deformations leaving invariant their computer <b>scientific</b> <b>properties</b> as presence or not of deadlocks (or everything similar or related). Some hints to study the algebraic structure of dihomotopy types are given, in particular a rule to decide whether a statement/notion concerning dihomotopy types is or not the lifting of another statement/notion concerning homotopy types.
