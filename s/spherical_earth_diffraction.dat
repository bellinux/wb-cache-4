40|$|Abstract Geometric {{spreading}} of Pn and Sn {{waves in}} a <b>spherical</b> <b>Earth</b> model {{is different than}} that of classical headwaves and is frequency dependent. The behavior cannot be fully represented by a frequency-independent power-law model, as is com-monly assumed. The lack of an accurate representation of Pn and Sn geometric spread-ing in a <b>spherical</b> <b>Earth</b> model impedes our ability to characterize Earth properties including anelasticity. We conduct numerical simulations to quantify Pn and Sn geometric spreading in a <b>spherical</b> <b>Earth</b> model with constant mantle-lid velocities. Based on our simulation results, we present new empirical Pn and Sn geometric-spreading models in the form Gr; f 10 n 3 f=r 0 r 0 =rn 1 f logr 0 =rn 2 f and nif ni 1 logf=f 02 ni 2 logf=f 0 ni 3, where i 1, 2, or 3; r is epicentral distance; f is frequency; r 0 1 km; and f 0 1 Hz. We derive values of coefficients nij by fitting the model to computed Pn and Sn amplitudes for a <b>spherical</b> <b>Earth</b> model having a 40 -km-thick crust, generic values of P and S velocities, and a constant-ve-locity uppermost mantle. We apply the new spreading model to observed data in Eur-asia to estimate average Pn attenuation, obtaining more reasonable results compared to using a standard power-law model. Our new Pn and Sn geometric-spreading models provide generally applicable reference behavior for <b>spherical</b> <b>Earth</b> models with con-stant uppermost-mantle velocities...|$|R
