500|$|After the {{disappointment}} of Black Sabbath, Gillan joined a reunited Deep Purple in April 1984, announcing their comeback on Tommy Vance's radio show. The reformed band rehearsed in Stowe, Vermont, and recorded the album Perfect Strangers, {{followed by a}} highly successful world tour. Another studio album with this formation, The House of Blue Light followed in 1987, but Gillan was concerned with the final results, stating [...] "There's <b>something</b> <b>missing</b> in the overall album. I can't feel {{the spirit of the}} band." ...|$|E
500|$|Bishop stated, [...] "Though viewers {{were given}} an {{explanation}} for his repulsive actions (lots and lots of childhood trauma), his crime was never excused or glossed over. Todd began to care for people – Rebecca, then Blair and later Téa – <b>something</b> <b>missing</b> in his earlier sociopathic characteristics." [...] Soap opera commentator Kaydee Barnett stated that Todd's dark edges had been softened {{over a period of}} many years by Blair, Viki, and Starr. Todd's deep love for his sister, Viki, was partly demonstrated by him supporting her during her battle with cancer, her difficulties with her daughter and his niece, Jessica, and by defending Viki to her enemies. Berry enjoyed the vulnerability Viki brought out of Todd, and felt that his self-hatred demonstrated itself in many ways, including when he refused to name his son, Jack, after himself because his name carried too much baggage.|$|E
500|$|Enema of the State {{is mainly}} {{considered}} a pop punk album and is even considered a skate punk album. According to Mike Damante of the Daily Cougar, the album [...] "embraces the pop side of pop-punk". The songs on Enema of the State are fast-paced songs regarding [...] "adolescent aimlessness, broken hearts and general confusion over {{the care and}} feeding of girls." [...] Summarizing the album's content, The New York Times called Enema of the State a sampling of [...] "ecstatic, goofy numbers about teenage uselessness, with a smattering of tender introspection." [...] The songs are mainly autobiographical, or are inspired by stories from friends' experiences. Enema of the State largely revolves around age and maturity—"more specifically, their lack of it, their attitude toward their lack of it, or their eventual wide-eyed exploration of it." [...] The band decided to emphasize arrangements, harmonies and melodic ideas rather than the fast-paced nature of Dude Ranch; the change was {{brought about by the}} band, rather than the label. Barker hoped to give the songs varying tempos, <b>something</b> <b>missing</b> in the group's prior recordings. [...] "I told Mark and Tom, 'It's going to be repetitive if all our songs have the same punk-rock beat all the time. Why don't we try some different tempos?'" [...] DeLonge noted he was open to his proposals, and responded, [...] "Dude, I just play guitar and write melodies. You own the beats. If you have an idea, that's what you're supposed to do." [...] DeLonge later reflected on his desire for a more [...] "pop" [...] sound: ...|$|E

500|$|Tyler had her {{breakthrough}} {{role in the}} art house film Stealing Beauty (1996), {{in which}} she played Lucy Harmon, an innocent, romantic teenager who travels to Tuscany, Italy, intent on losing her virginity. The film received generally mixed reviews, but Tyler's performance was regarded favorably by the critics. Variety wrote: [...] "Tyler is the perfect accomplice. At times sweetly awkward, at others composed and serene, the actress appears to respond effortlessly and intuitively to the camera, creating a rich sense of what Lucy is about that often is not explicit in the dialogue." [...] Empire noted, [...] "Liv Tyler (here radiantly resembling a ganglier young Ava Gardner) with {{a rare opportunity to}} enamour, a break she capitalizes on with composure." [...] The film was directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, who chose Tyler for the role after meeting with a number of young girls in Los Angeles, including Tyler's music video co-star Alicia Silverstone. Bertolucci said [...] "there was <b>something</b> <b>missing</b> in all of them". He later said that what he saw in Tyler was a gravitas he described as [...] "a New York aura". During promotion of the film, Tyler said she wanted to separate herself from the character during production: [...] "I tried my damnedest not to think of my own situation. But at one point, after a take, I just started to cry and cry. I remembered when I found out about my dad and how we just stared at each other from head to toe taking in every nook and cranny." ...|$|E
500|$|After [...] "composed performances" [...] {{on trial}} in pre-season, Courtney signed a one-year {{contract}} with Conference Premier club Kidderminster Harriers on 20 July 2009. He made his debut as a substitute in the 66th minute of a 1–0 victory over Hayes & Yeading United on 8 August 2009, which was followed by his first start in a 1–0 defeat to Salisbury City on 11 August due to Liam Dolman not being fit. He played against Tamworth on 31 August 2009 despite an injury and although he was still suffering this injury {{he was able to}} play in the next match, a 2–0 defeat to Eastbourne Borough. Courtney commented in September 2009 that Kidderminster's defence was taking time to gel, saying [...] "We've all played at a high standard, individually and collectively we are good, but there's <b>something</b> <b>missing.</b> I think it's communication between us, which is why we're making mistakes." [...] His first and only goal for Kidderminster came with a low shot at Kettering Town in a 2–0 victory on 21 November 2009 and manager Mark Yates said [...] "It was a good finish by Duane, he does it in training quite often". He played for Kidderminster in their run to the FA Trophy semi-final, in which they were beaten 5–1 on aggregate by Stevenage Borough. Courtney suffered an ankle injury against Cambridge United on 30 March 2010 and returned in the following match against Altrincham on 3 April, in which he was forced to be substituted due to his ankle. He did not miss any further playing time as he featured in the following match, a 1–1 draw with Rushden & Diamonds on 5 April 2010. He finished 2009–10 with 49 appearances and 1 goal for Kidderminster.|$|E

2500|$|The band toured {{throughout}} 1986, and Gillespie became {{disenchanted with}} the quality of their performances.

Before the band entered Rockfield Studios in Wales to record their debut album, McGurk was asked to leave the band. The group subsequently began recording using session players. They spent four weeks recording with producer Stephen Street before deciding to halt the sessions.|$|E

2500|$|Before February 1954, no {{endeavor}} {{to get the}} pledge officially amended had succeeded. The final successful push came from George MacPherson Docherty. Some American presidents honored Lincoln's birthday by attending services at the church Lincoln attended, New York Avenue Presbyterian Church by sitting in Lincoln's pew on the Sunday nearest February 12. On February 7, 1954, with President Eisenhower sitting in Lincoln's pew, the church's pastor, George MacPherson Docherty, delivered a sermon based on the Gettysburg Address entitled [...] "A New Birth of Freedom." [...] He argued that the nation's might lay not in arms but rather in its spirit and higher purpose. He noted that the Pledge's sentiments could be those of any nation: [...] "There was <b>something</b> <b>missing</b> in the pledge, and that which was missing was the characteristic and definitive factor in the American way of life." [...] He cited Lincoln's words [...] "under God" [...] as defining words that set the US apart from other nations.|$|E

[...] GameSpot awarded the game 8.5 out of ten and said [...] "This fast-paced racer keeps you glued to the TV and {{on the edge of}} your seat regardless of which side of the law you're playing on." [...] Official Xbox Magazine gave the Xbox 360 version 7 out of 10, and said [...] "Hot Pursuit feels a little too safe for its subject matter, limited by pedestrian road design that doesn't express all the playfulness that we'd expect in car combat." [...] However, the UK edition of the magazine gave the game a 9 out of 10, and said [...] "It pays respect to the classic NFS games, borrows the best bits from Burnout and is a technical masterpiece. The chase to reclaim NFSs once legendary chart topping form is well and truly on." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ramsey Isler of IGN {{was more}} {{critical}} of the episode and rated it 7.7 out of 10. Due to the season's shortened length, {{he said he was}} a [...] "tiny bit concerned that this season premiere wasn't as powerful as I hoped." [...] Isler added that while the episode [...] "does a good job of filling in the informational gaps... there's still <b>something</b> <b>missing.</b> There's still no link between where we were for 4 seasons, and where we are now." [...] He was unsure about Henrietta's addition, writing that because she was [...] "thrust into the mix and viewers were just expected to accept her as is," [...] she did not yet feel a part of the series. Isler did however praise the final sequence with Walter, writing that it [...] "is a great scene; artfully directed and made even more special by the fact that Fringe rarely uses pop music to set the mood. This scene is simple, but impressive enough to stand out as the best part of this episode and {{set the tone for the}} rest of the season. There's still hope for this story and this world, and as usual Fringe viewers will have to be patient to see that hope spring forth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Evert {{went into}} the 1982 Australian Open, having never won the tournament down under, which she wanted to rectify that fact and the gap on her grand slam resume. [...] Evert's {{opponent}} in the final was Navratilova, who was the defending champion. [...] The final was tied as one set apeice, and {{went into the}} pivotal and crucial third set, which in the second game Evert broke Navratilova to go up two games to none. [...] But in the third game, Evert failed to hold serve and lost the game. Subsequently, Evert quickly took the break advantage back in the fourth game to lead three games to one, and held serve to go up four games to one, which Evert said [...] "I thought...this is it." [...] Evert would quickly come back to reality, when feisty Navratilova, held serve in the sixth game of the set, then broke Evert in the seventh game of the set to narrow the gap to four games to three. [...] All this time, Evert was thinking about last years final, which eluded her grasp. [...] This one would be different however because in the eight game would break Navratilova, and the ninth would go to 30-love on a splendid crosscourt forehand, which at match point she hit a blazing winner {{to the other side of}} the court. [...] This was Evert's first Australian Open, which completed her career grand slam, and her fourteenth slam title for her career just ten days before her twenty-eighth birthday. [...] Later, Evert told reporters [...] "I have wanted this tournament so badly. [...] Then it was over and I had won it...it was a very emotional moment for me because this title meant so much...the Australian title has been the missing link in my career.
