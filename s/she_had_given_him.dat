Meanwhile, Reverend Mother Mohiam accuses Leto's concubine, the Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica, of defying their secret centuries-long breeding program, aimed to produce a male Bene Gesserit they call the Kwisatz Haderach who would have mental powers to see throughout time and space.

25|$|The novel {{opens with}} Dr. Norval's return to New England from a {{geological}} expedition in the Southwest, {{accompanied by a}} ten-year-old girl, Lola, and trunks of supposed geological specimens. He was appointed her guardian {{when he and his}} companions, Mr. Lebrun and Mr. Sinclair, rescued her from Indian captivity. Because her skin was dyed black by her captors, her arrival generates commotion among the abolitionist women in the household, especially Mrs. Norval. She is disgusted at the idea of Dr. Norval contaminating the racial purity of their home, despite his insistence that Lola is of pure Spanish descent and the dye will fade. Mrs. Norval demands that Lola work in order to pay for expenses; Dr. Norval objects and explains to her, through a flashback, how he encountered Lola's mother, Doña Theresa Medina. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>him</b> gold and precious gems she acquired as a captive of the Apache to finance Lola's care.
