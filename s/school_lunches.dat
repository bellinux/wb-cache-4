5|$|Consequently, Taiji's bid {{to expand}} their school lunch {{programs}} to include dolphin and whale meat brought about much controversy. An estimated 150kg (330lbs) of dolphin meat was served in Taiji <b>school</b> <b>lunches</b> in 2006. In 2009, dolphin meat was taken off school menus because of the contamination. The levels of mercury and methylmercury taken from samples of dolphin and whale meat sold at supermarkets {{most likely to be}} providing the schools' lunch programs was 10 times that advised by the Japanese Health Ministry. The mercury levels were so high that the Okuwa Co. supermarket chain in Japan permanently removed dolphin meat from its shelves.|$|E

40|$|Background: As the United States {{suffers from}} a {{childhood}} obesity epidemic, more {{attention has been given}} to <b>school</b> <b>lunch</b> nutrition. Federal requirements on <b>school</b> <b>lunch</b> are evolving to include a variety of fruits and vegetables, whereas other programs study ways to increase healthy food consumption during <b>school</b> <b>lunch.</b> This project categorizes fruits and vegetables by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Cornell University’s Smarter Lunchrooms <b>school</b> <b>lunch</b> categories in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of fruit and vegetable waste during <b>school</b> <b>lunch.</b> Methods: Visual estimations of tray waste were collected across four school districts. Averages of fruit and vegetable waste within the USDA and Smarter Lunchrooms categories were compared from pre-kindergarten through high school. Results and Discussion: Across all grades, students waste less fruits and vegetables as they age. The USDA food categories give a description for food consumption, while Smarter Lunchrooms is more useful for food production. As food service directors manage budgets, meal planning, and profit, the Smarter Lunchrooms behavioral strategies can decrease fruit and vegetable waste in USDA categories while managing a <b>school</b> <b>lunch</b> program...|$|R

25|$|Between 1998 and 2003, the canning {{industry}} voluntarily replaced its BPA-containing epoxy resin can liners with BPA-free polyethylene terephthalate (PET) {{in many of}} its products.

In addition, polycarbonate tableware for <b>school</b> <b>lunches</b> was replaced by BPA-free plastics.

40|$|Hypothesis: Average {{levels of}} {{attainment}} in {{primary and secondary}} schools in England in 2010 and 2011 are positively associated with changes in average <b>school</b> <b>lunch</b> take up between 2008 - 2009 and 2010 - 2011. Subjects/Methods: Average <b>school</b> <b>lunch</b> take up and attainment data were available for 2009 - 2011 for primary and secondary sectors in a minimum of 106 local authorities (LA) in England and 853 individual primary schools in six LAs. Associations between attainment at 11 - 12 y (primary) and 15 - 16 y (secondary) and changes in <b>school</b> <b>lunch</b> take up were tested for using multilevel analysis, multiple regression, and cross-tabulation (chi-squared analysis). Results: At school level, attainment at 11 - 12 y in 2010 and 2011 showed nine positive and 12 negative associations with changes in <b>school</b> <b>lunch</b> take up between 2009 and 2011. At LA level, average attainment at 15 - 16 y in 2011 was associated with changes in total <b>school</b> <b>lunch</b> take up in 2010 - 2011 (p= 0. 034). Cross-tabulation of changes in attainment 2010 - 2011 (above or below median) were positively associated with changes in total <b>school</b> <b>lunch</b> take up between 2009 - 2011, by quartiles (Chi-squared= 11. 041, df= 3, p= 0. 012). Conclusions: Attainment at secondary level in England is statistically significantly associated with increases in healthier <b>school</b> <b>lunch</b> take up. Results in the primary sector are not consistent...|$|R

Japan has started to serve whale meat in <b>school</b> <b>lunches</b> {{as part of a}} government initiative to reduce the amounts. However, there has been criticism of serving whale meat to school children due to allegations of toxic methylmercury levels.

25|$|Historians credit Britain with {{a highly}} {{successful}} record of mobilizing the home front for the war effort, in terms of mobilizing the greatest proportion of potential workers, maximizing output, assigning the right skills to the right task, and maintaining the morale and spirit of the people. Much of this success {{was due to the}} systematic planned mobilization of women, as workers, soldiers and housewives, enforced after December 1941 by conscription. The women supported the war effort, and made the rationing of consumer goods a success. In some ways, the government over planned, evacuating too many children in the first days of the war, closing cinemas as frivolous then reopening them when the need for cheap entertainment was clear, sacrificing cats and dogs to save a little space on shipping pet food, only to discover an urgent need to keep the rats and mice under control. In the balance between compulsion and voluntarism, the British relied successfully on voluntarism. The success of the government in providing new services, such as hospitals, and <b>school</b> <b>lunches,</b> as well as the equalitarian spirit of the People's war, contributed to widespread support for an enlarged welfare state. Munitions production rose dramatically, and the quality remained high. Food production was emphasized, in large part to open up shipping for munitions. Farmers increased the number of acres under cultivation from 12,000,000 to 18,000,000, and the farm labor force was expanded by a fifth, thanks especially to the Women's Land Army.|$|E
