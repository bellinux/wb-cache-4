500|$|The author Nicholas Tucker {{notes that}} it was common to see Blyton cited as people's {{favourite}} or least favourite author according to their age, and argues that her books create an [...] "encapsulated world for young readers that simply dissolves with age, leaving behind only memories of excitement and strong identification". Fred Inglis considers Blyton's books to be technically easy to read, but to also be [...] "emotionally and cognitively easy". He mentions that the psychologist Michael Woods believed that Blyton was different from many other older authors writing for children in that she seemed untroubled by presenting them with a world that differed from reality. Woods surmised that Blyton [...] "was a child, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>as</b> a child, and wrote as a child... the basic feeling is essentially pre-adolescent... Enid Blyton has no moral dilemmas... Inevitably Enid Blyton was labelled by rumour a child-hater. If true, such a fact {{should come as no}} surprise to us, for as a child herself all other children can be nothing but rivals for her." [...] Inglis argues though that Blyton was clearly devoted to children and put an enormous amount of energy into her work, with a powerful belief in [...] "representing the crude moral diagrams and garish fantasies of a readership". Blyton's daughter Imogen has stated that she [...] "loved a relationship with children through her books", but real children were an intrusion, and there was no room for intruders in the world that Blyton occupied through her writing.|$|E

60|$|Bella {{was amazed}} by the flush in his face, and by his sudden turning away. 'What can it mean?' <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> she {{accompanied}} him up stairs.|$|E
60|$|So Alice {{picked him}} up very gently, and lifted him across more slowly than she had lifted the Queen, that she mightn't take his breath away: but, before she {{put him on the}} table, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> might <b>as</b> well dust him a little, he was so covered with ashes.|$|R

6000|$|... "I'm {{afraid it}} means no Christmas for the {{children}} tomorrow," [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> sadly, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> led Ned away to the stable. When {{she returned to the}} kitchen Mrs. Martin was sitting by the fire, her face in her chilled hand, sobbing convulsively.|$|R
6000|$|She {{sank back}} in her chair. [...] "Does he?" [...] she asked listlessly, and <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> of another person, how her heart would once have thrilled at the hope of this.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is true," [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> {{she went}} away; [...] "but any fool {{could have told}} me that. This wise man is a fraud; even my husband is as wise as he." ...|$|E
6000|$|Susan {{shook her}} head. She disapproved entirely of such ejaculations. [...] "I hope {{he will not}} let his mother hear him talking like that," [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>as</b> she stacked the hoes and rake away.|$|E
60|$|Pressed, rigid, {{against the}} wall behind her curtain, Molly had listened in utter bewilderment {{to the sounds of}} strife in the passage outside. The half-heard {{conversation}} between the detectives had done nothing toward a solution of the mystery. Galer's voice <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> recognized <b>as</b> one that she had heard before; but she could not identify it.|$|R
6000|$|Corny didn't {{say much}} on the way home, and {{she looked as if}} she was doing some private thinking. I suppose, among other things, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>as</b> I {{considered}} it all right to call Rectus Rectus, she might as well do it herself, for she said: ...|$|R
6000|$|Nursey tucked Demi in, {{and went}} off to reconnoitre, but only found two boys slumbering peacefully in Dan's room. [...] "Some little frolic," [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> and <b>as</b> there was no harm done she said nothing to Mrs. Bhaer, who was busy and worried over little Teddy.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope she}} won't notice my eyes," [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> she hastily plumped a big ugly dark-green shade, with an almond-eyed oriental leering from it, over the lamp, before {{going out to}} let Margaret in.|$|E
6000|$|... "I never shall suit this dear prim soul," [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> her eye {{went from}} Puss, sedately perched on one small mat, {{to the dog}} dozing upon another, and neither {{offering}} to stir from their own dominions.|$|E
6000|$|... "I saw {{him talking}} to my old friend Tommy Tit the Chickadee, and I just know that Tommy will {{tell me all about}} him," [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> she scampered along certain private little paths of her own.|$|E
6000|$|Anne knew it, but {{the thought}} of that widowed home {{depressed}} her. It might, <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> be <b>as</b> dull as Oakwood, and there would be infinite chances of preferment at Court. What she said, however, was: [...] "It was by my mother's wish that I applied to Lady Oglethorpe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{little brown}} boy--my little brown boy," [...] said Susan. [...] "I wonder," [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> bitterly, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{looked at the}} doctor's sorrowful face, [...] "if you {{remember}} how you spanked him once {{when he was a}} baby. I am thankful I have nothing like that on my conscience now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No mum, but <b>she</b> {{might have}} <b>thought</b> (<b>as</b> a habit-like) of its {{standing}} in Johnny's light, {{and might have}} tried to bring him through it unbeknownst.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{helped him}} {{to rise from the}} chair, and took his arm in her own. [...] "It is well for him; it is well for me," [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> they went downstairs together, [...] "that I came when I did." ...|$|E
6000|$|Alice didn't {{know what}} to say to this: it wasn't at all like conversation, <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> he never said {{anything}} to HER; in fact, his last remark was evidently addressed to a tree--so she stood and softly repeated to herself:-- ...|$|E
60|$|She {{would like}} that, <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> she clambered {{up the steep}} paths; and perhaps she would meet these American girls again, or others like them, and make them her friends. She had never known a girl friend, as yet.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked up}} from one man to the other. The Lord of Stoutenburg, dark and sullen, was {{watching}} her with restless eyes; the prisoner was smiling, gently, almost self-deprecatingly <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> and <b>as</b> he met her frightened glance {{it seemed as if}} in his merry eyes there crept a look of sadness--even of pity.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} well, {{and did not}} speak {{in the hope of}} making any change in your views, Mr. Hugh. Mary Warren, however, will not think much of my remark to-morrow; I do not believe <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> half <b>as</b> much about it to-night as I should have done, had it been made to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is, if {{he gives}} me a chance to say {{anything}} at all," [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> ruefully, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> climbed the lane fence and started on a short cut across the fields, golden {{in the light of the}} dreamy August evening. [...] "I know now just how people feel who are being led to execution." ...|$|R
60|$|This didn't {{sound like}} a remark that needed any answer, so Alice said nothing, but pulled away. There was {{something}} very queer about the water, <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> {{every now and then}} the oars got fast in it, and would hardly come out again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, that's {{the best}} place for such {{inflammable}} nonsense. I'd better burn the house down, I suppose, than let other people blow themselves up with my gunpowder," [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>as</b> she watched the Demon of the Jura whisk away, a little black cinder with fiery eyes.|$|E
60|$|His mortified {{face was}} {{recognised}} by the landlady, returning from her morning's {{visit to the}} shops. The gentleman looked, <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> if he had received bad news! She not unnaturally connected his appearance with her lodger. Tapping on the girl's door, and receiving no answer, she went in.|$|E
6000|$|... "That was Uncle Cal's style. But I {{never lost}} any {{patience}} with him, {{on account of}} his thinking so much of Marilla. And <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> just <b>as</b> much of him. He sent her to the academy over at Birdstail for two years when it took nearly every pound of wool to pay the expenses.|$|R
6000|$|... "And my John can see 'im as far <b>as</b> Chelwood," [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> {{to herself}} <b>as</b> <b>she</b> finally {{closed the door}} on the {{stranger}} and made her way slowly down the creaking stairs.|$|R
60|$|Agatha {{was silent}} for some moments because she was {{surprised}} and moved. George had a keener imagination and saw farther than <b>she</b> <b>thought.</b> It looked <b>as</b> if he had known her mother best.|$|R
6000|$|They parted, Farfrae {{returning}} {{into the}} dark Bowling Walk, and Elizabeth-Jane going up the street. Without any consciousness {{of what she was}} doing she started running with all her might till she reached her father's door. [...] "O dear me--what am I at?" [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> she pulled up breathless.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was," [...] she said, bobbing {{her head}} at him. She was just so far from him, <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> to be safe from any impetuous movement. [...] "And Hannah was nearly as bad." [...] Hannah was the old woman. [...] "You may imagine we had a wretched night of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I will go now and {{see what}} I {{can get out of}} the pussies,' said Peppina, the elder girl, one morning, as she took Lizina's basket and {{fastened}} her pockets into her own skirt. 'I should like some of the cats' gold for myself,' <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> she left her mother's house before the sun rose.|$|E
6000|$|Lucy much {{wished to}} be with them; and after a long {{brooding}} over her ill-temper, it began to wear out, not to be conquered, but to depart of itself; <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> might <b>as</b> well learn her lesson and have done with it; so by way {{of getting rid of}} the task, not of profiting by the warning it conveyed, she hurried through the two verses ending with--"Behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth!" ...|$|R
50|$|She is a {{tall and}} {{beautiful}} woman. Lei Xiao Yu dreams for a true hero to appear and protect her. There are several men that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>as</b> her true love, such as Wu Shi Lang, Li Ya Shou and Lin Chi. In the end she {{falls in love with}} the Lei family butler Chang Ling Lu, and they get married.|$|R
6000|$|Before {{putting the}} letter away, she {{looked again at}} {{that part of it}} which {{mentioned}} Lady Doris's introduction of Cecilia to Mr. Mirabel. [...] "I don't feel the slightest interest in Mr. Mirabel," [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> smiling <b>as</b> the idea occurred to her; [...] "and I need never have known him, but for Lady Doris--who is a perfect stranger to me." ...|$|R
