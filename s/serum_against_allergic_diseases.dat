40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{fact that}} {{breastfeeding}} may protect <b>against</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>disease</b> remains controversial, with hardly any reports from developing countries. This {{study investigated the}} association between <b>allergic</b> <b>disease</b> in children and prolonged breastfeeding. Data were collected from a 15 % random sample of households from two poor suburbs of Cape Town, South Africa. Parents completed a validated International Study on Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire on <b>allergic</b> <b>diseases</b> for children aged 6 – 14 yrs. Other questions included breastfeeding duration, maternal smoking and parental allergy. Results were adjusted for possible confounders and for possible clustering within the household. Out of the 861 children included in the study, <b>allergic</b> <b>disease</b> in general, and hay fever in particular, were significantly less frequent in those with prolonged (o 6 months) breastfeeding. There was a significant linear inverse association between breastfeeding duration and <b>allergic</b> <b>disease</b> in children without allergic parents, but not in children with an allergic predisposition. In conclusion, these results from a developing country suggest a protective effect of prolonged breastfeeding {{on the development of}} <b>allergic</b> <b>disease,</b> particularly hay fever, in children born to nonallergic parents.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Exposure to allergens, both {{in general}} and {{occupational}} environments, is known to result in sensitisation and exacerbation of <b>allergic</b> <b>diseases,</b> while endotoxin exposure might protect <b>against</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>diseases.</b> This may be important for veterinarians and co-workers.

Allergen levels in extracts were measured with sandwich ELISAs and/or the multiplex array for indoor allergens (MARIA). Endotoxin was determined by limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay.

40|$|Allergen-specific {{immunotherapy}} (SIT) {{is currently}} the best available curative treatment in allergies and {{has been used for}} the treatment of patients for the past 100 years. The formation of a Th 2 cell predominant inflammation in addition to production of allergen-specific IgE, the attraction of proinflammatory cells and the degranulation of effector cells, such as mast cells, are essential mechanisms in allergy development.

The induction of allergen tolerance is the key to successful SIT.

40|$|Resolution of infections {{depends on}} the host’s ability to mount a {{protective}} immune response. However, an exacerbated response to infections may result in deleterious lesions. Consequently, immunoregulatory mechanisms are needed to control immune response and prevent infection-associated lesions. Interleukin 10 may be a major regulator of innate and adaptive immunity in vitro and in animals, but its role in human infections is still unclear. Review of the published work reveals wide involvement of interleukin 10 in two major features of infectious diseases. On one hand, interleukin 10 prevents the development of immunopathological lesions that result from exacerbated protective immune response to acute and chronic infections. On the other hand, it is critically involved in persistence of bacteria and viruses by interfering with innate and adaptive protective immunity.

40|$|Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern {{recognition}} receptors {{crucial for the}} innate and adaptive immune response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). TLR stimulation via microbial products activates antigen-presenting cells, influences the function of T regulatory cells (Treg), determines the Th 1 /Th 2 balance and Th 17 cell differentiation, and controls cytokine production in mast cells and activation of eosinophils. The role of TLR receptors in pathogenesis of <b>allergic</b> <b>diseases</b> results from the biological function that they play in activation and regulation of the immune response. However, the exact role still remains a controversial area. Whereas numerous epidemiological studies mainly indicate a protective effect of microbial exposure, experiments show that innate immune stimulation via TLRs {{may be involved in}} both development of and protection <b>against</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>diseases.</b> Timing, dose, site and intensity of exposure to environmental factors and host genetic predisposition are clearly crucial to understanding the interaction between innate immune stimulation and allergy development.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{prevalence of}} <b>allergic</b> <b>diseases</b> in childhood {{in the last}} decades could be linked to concomitant dietary changes, especially with the modified and lower consumption of fruit, vegetables and minerals. The consumption of these foods by pregnant {{women and children in}} the first years of life seems to be associated with a reduced risk of asthma and related symptoms. Foods that can prevent the development of wheezing through their antioxidant effects contain vitamin C and selenium; blood levels of these elements correlate negatively with the risk of wheezing. Intake of vitamin E during pregnancy also appears to be correlated with a reduced risk of wheezing for the unborn child. Similarly, low intake of zinc and carotenoids by pregnant women is associated with an increased risk of wheezing and asthma in childhood. Fiber also has anti-inflammatory properties and protective effects <b>against</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>diseases</b> such as atopic dermatitis and asthma. The consumption of fat influences the development of the airways. Populations in Western countries have increased their consumption of n- 6 PUFAs and, in parallel, reduced n- 3 PUFAs. This has led to decreased production of PGE 2, which is believed to have a protective effect against inflammation of the airways. Conflicting hypotheses also concern vitamin D; both an excess and a deficiency of vitamin D, in fact, have been associated with an increased risk of asthma. Further studies on the role of these substances are necessary before any conclusions can be drawn on a clinical level...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Although the {{genetics}} of asthma {{has been extensively}} studied using both quantitative and molecular genetic analysis methods, both approaches lack studies specific to the childhood phenotype and including other <b>allergic</b> <b>diseases.</b> This study aimed to give specific estimates for the heritability of childhood asthma and other <b>allergic</b> <b>diseases,</b> to attempt to replicate findings from genomewide association studies (GWAS) for childhood asthma and to test the same variants <b>against</b> other <b>allergic</b> <b>diseases.</b> METHODS: In a cohort of 25 306 Swedish twins aged 9 or 12 years, data on asthma were available from parental interviews and population-based registers. The interviews also inquired about wheeze, hay fever, eczema, and food allergy. Through structural equation modeling, the heritability of all phenotypes was calculated. A subset of 10 075 twins was genotyped for 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected from previous GWAS; these were first tested for association with asthma and significant findings also <b>against</b> the other <b>allergic</b> <b>diseases.</b> RESULTS: The heritability of any childhood asthma was 0. 82 (95 % CI 0. 79 - 0. 85). For the other <b>allergic</b> <b>diseases,</b> the range was approximately 0. 60 - 0. 80. Associations for six SNPs with asthma were replicated, including rs 2305480 in the GSDMB gene (OR 0. 80, 95 % CI 0. 74 - 0. 86, P = 1. 5 * 10 (- 8); other significant associations all below P = 3. 5 * 10 (- 4)).

We provide evidence that endogenously produced activin-A suppresses antigen-specific Th 2 responses and protects against airway hyperresponsiveness and <b>allergic</b> airway <b>disease</b> in mice. Importantly, we reveal that activin-A exerts suppressive function through induction of antigen-specific regulatory T cells that suppress Th 2 responses in vitro and upon transfer in vivo. In fact, activin-A also suppresses Th 1 -driven responses, pointing to a broader immunoregulatory function. Blockade of interleukin 10 and transforming growth factor β 1 reverses activin-A–induced suppression.

40|$|Perinatal {{exposures}} {{are associated}} with altered risks of childhood allergy. Human studies and our previous work suggest restricted growth in utero (IUGR) is protective <b>against</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>disease.</b> The mechanisms are not clearly defined but reduced fetal abundance and altered metabolism of methyl donors are hypothesized as possible underlying mechanisms. We therefore examined whether late gestation maternal dietary methyl donor and co-factor supplementation of the placentally-restricted (PR) sheep pregnancy would reverse allergic protection in progeny. Allergic outcomes were compared between progeny from control pregnancies (CON, n= 49), from PR pregnancies without intervention (PR, n= 28), and from PR pregnancies where the dam was fed a methyl donor plus co-factor supplement from day 120 of pregnancy until delivery (PR+METHYL, n= 25). Both PR and PR+METHYL progeny were smaller than CON; supplementation did not alter birth size. PR was protective against cutaneous hypersensitivity responses to ovalbumin (OVA, P < 0. 01 in singletons). Cutaneous hypersensitivity responses to OVA in PR+METHYL progeny were intermediate to and not different from responses of CON and PR sheep. Cutaneous hypersensitivity responses to house dust mite did not differ between treatments. In singleton progeny, upper dermal mast cell density was greater in PR+METHYL than PR or CON (each P < 0. 05). The differences in the cutaneous allergic response were not explained by treatment effects on circulating immune cells or antibodies. Our results suggest that mechanisms underlying in utero programming of allergic susceptibility by IUGR and methyl donor availability may differ, and imply that late gestation methyl donor supplementation may increase allergy risk...|$|R

We further analyzed the association between the expression of innate immune genes at birth and atopic dermatitis. METHODS: A total of 1063 children who participated in a birth cohort study, Protection against Allergy-Study in Rural Environments, were included in this study. Doctor diagnosis of atopic dermatitis was reported by the parents from 1 to 2 years of age by questionnaire. Gene expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and CD 14 was assessed in cord blood leukocytes by quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Maternal contact with farm animals and cats during pregnancy had a significantly protective effect on atopic dermatitis in the first 2 years of life. The risk of atopic dermatitis was reduced by more than half among children with mothers having contact with 3 or more farm animal species during pregnancy compared with children with mothers without contact (adjusted odds ratio, 0. 43; 95 % CI, 0. 19 - 0. 97). Elevated expression of TLR 5 and TLR 9 in cord blood was associated with decreased doctor diagnosis of atopic dermatitis.

40|$|Using the {{systematic}} evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) method, we identified oligonucleotides that bind {{to the first}} extracellular domain of the Orai 1 protein with high affinities and high specificities. These ligands were isolated from a random single-strand DNA (ssDNA) library with 40 randomized sequence positions, using synthesized peptides with amino acid sequences identical to the first extracellular domain of the Orai 1 protein as the targets for SELEX selection. Seven aptamers were obtained after 12 rounds of SELEX. An enzyme-linked oligonucleotide assay (ELONA) was performed to determine the affinities of the aptamers. Aptamer Y 1 had the highest affinity (Kd = 1. 72 × 10 - 8 mol/L) and was selected for functional experiments in mast cells. Using LAD 2 cells with the human high-affinity IgE receptor and Ca 2 + release activation channel (CRAC), we demonstrated that Aptamer Y 1 blocked IgE-mediated β-hexosaminidase release from cells triggered by biotin-IgE and streptavidin. A specific binding assay showed that Aptamer Y 1 not only bound the Orai 1 peptide specifically but also that the Orai 1 peptide did not bind significantly to other random oligonucleotide molecules. Furthermore, Aptamer Y 1 regulation of intracellular Ca 2 + mobilization was investigated by probing intracellular Ca 2 + with a Fluo- 4 -AM fluorescent probe. We found that Aptamer Y 1 inhibits Ca 2 + influx into antigen-activated mast cells.

METHODS: One thousand five hundred and sixty-six schoolchildren aged 6 - 17 were randomly allocated to receive either anti-helminthic therapy or a placebo at 0, 3, 6, and 9 months. We compared changes in the prevalence of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, allergen skin sensitization, flexural eczema on skin examination, questionnaire-reported <b>allergic</b> <b>disease</b> (wheeze and rhinitis symptoms), and immunological parameters (hookworm-induced IFN-gamma, IL- 5, IL- 10) between 0 and 12 months. RESULTS: One thousand four hundred and eighty-seven children (95 % of these randomized) completed the study. The most common helminth infections were hookworm (65 %) and Ascaris lumbricoides (7 %). There was no effect of the therapy on the primary outcome, exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (within-participant mean percent fall in peak flow from baseline after anti-helminthic treatment 2. 25 (SD 7. 3) vs. placebo 2. 19 (SD 7. 8, P= 0. 9), or on the prevalence of questionnaire-reported wheeze [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1. 16, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 35 - 3. 82, P= 0. 8] and rhinitis (adjusted OR= 1. 39, 0. 89 - 2. 15, P= 0. 1), or flexural dermatitis on skin examination (adjusted OR= 1. 15, 0. 39 - 3. 45, P= 0. 8). However, anti-helminthic therapy was associated with a significantly higher allergen skin sensitization risk (adjusted OR= 1. 31, 1. 02 - 1. 67, P= 0. 03). This effect was particularly strong for children infected with A. lumbricoides at baseline (adjusted OR= 4. 90, 1. 48 - 16. 19, P= 0. 009). Allergen skin sensitization was inversely related to hookworm-specific IL- 10 at baseline (adjusted OR= 0. 76, 0. 59 - 0. 99, P= 0. 04). No cytokine tested, including IL- 10, changed significantly after the anti-helminthic therapy compared with the placebo. CONCLUSION: A significant reduction in worm burden over a 12 -month period in helminth-infected children increases the risk of allergen skin sensitization but not of clinical <b>allergic</b> <b>disease.</b> The effect on skin sensitization could not be fully explained by any of the immunological parameters tested.

40|$|Purpose of reviewAgriculture {{represents}} a major industry worldwide, and despite {{protection against the}} development of IgE-mediated diseases, chronic exposure to agriculture-related organic dusts is {{associated with an increased}} risk of developing respiratory disease. This article will review the literature regarding new knowledge of important etiologic agents in the dusts and focus on the immunologic responses following acute and repetitive organic dust exposures. Recent findingsAlthough endotoxin remains important, there is an emerging role for non-endotoxin components such as peptidoglycans from Gram-positive bacteria. Pattern recognition receptors including Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4), TLR 2 and intracellular nucleotide oligomerization domain-like receptors are partially responsible for mediating the inflammatory consequences. Repeated organic dust exposures modulate innate and adaptive immune function with a resultant adaptation-like response. However, repetitive exposures cause lung parenchymal inflammation, chronic disease, and lung function decline over time. SummaryThe immunological consequences of organic dust exposure in the farming industry are likely explained by the diversity of microbial motifs in dust that can elicit differing innate immune receptor signaling pathways. Whereas initial activation results in a robust inflammatory response, repetitive dust exposures modulate immunity. This can result in low-grade, chronic inflammation and/or protection <b>against</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>disease.</b> 1 U 54 OH 010162 - 01 /OH/NIOSH CDC HHS/United StatesES 015522 - 03 S 1 /ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United StatesK 08 ES 015522 /ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United StatesK 08 ES 015522 - 01 /ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United StatesK 08 ES 015522 - 05 /ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United StatesR 01 ES 019325 /ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United StatesR 01 ES 019325 /ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United StatesR 01 ES 019325 - 02 /ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United StatesR 01 OH 008539 - 01 /OH/NIOSH CDC HHS/United States 2013 - 04 - 01 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 22306554 PMC 329267...|$|R
40|$|Background: A gain of {{function}} mutation (Q 551 - > R) in the IL- 4 receptor α-chain (IL- 4 Rα) {{has been found}} to be associated with atopy in some studies but not others. The different results may be explained by interactions between the IL- 4 Rα polymorphism and environmental factors. Objectives: To identify interactions between the R 551 mutation and environmental factors that are associated with atopy. Methods: DNA from the Children in Focus (CiF) cohort of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) was genotyped by heteroduplex formation for the presence of the R 551 polymorphism. The data were then analysed for associations with flexural eczema as an indicator of atopic eczema, skin prick tests to allergens and serum IgE levels, and for interactions with environmental factors. Results: A significant (P = 0. 02) positive association was seen between the R 551 polymorphism and flexural eczema in children up to 6 months of age who had not been given antibiotics, but not in children who had been given antibiotics. This association was maintained as a trend until 30 to 42 months of age but was no longer statistically significant. There was no significant association between the R 551 polymorphism and positive skin prick tests or levels of serum IgE at 61 months of age, consistent with the effect of the R 551 polymorphism being restricted to early life. Conclusion: There is an association between the R 551 polymorphism and flexural eczema in children at 6 months of age who have not had infection requiring treatment with antibiotics. Restriction of the R 551 association with eczema to children who have not had antibiotics lends support to the ‘hygiene hypothesis’, which states that exposure to infection in childhood can protect <b>against</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>disease.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundAngiogenesis is one {{pathogenesis}} of <b>allergic</b> airway <b>disease.</b> Methodspotent angiogenic {{factor is}} platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF), {{also known as}} thymidine phosphorylase (TP) {{in the field of}} cancer-associated research. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is another representative angiogenic factor. Both factors were added to the culture system of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with IL- 4 and anti-CD 40 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Total IgE levels in the supernatants and signal transduction of stimulated PBMC were evaluated. ResultsAddition of PD-ECGF enhances in vitro IgE production by PBMC in the presence of IL- 4 and anti- CD 40 mAb, but VEGF does not enhance IgE production. Although PD-ECGF catalyzes the reversible phosphorolysis of thymidine to 2 -deoxy-D-ribose- 1 -phosphate (2 DDR), treatment of 2 DDR has no effect on IgE production by human PBMC. Both IL- 4 and anti-CD 40 mAb induce PD-ECGF by human PBMC. Thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor (TPI), 5 -chloro- 6 -[1 - (2 -iminopyrrolidinyl) methyl] uracil hydrochloride reduce IgE production via blocking of STAT 6 - phosphorylation. ConclusionsTaken together, these results suggest TP involvement in the enhancement of IgE production and suggest that TPI is a novel strategy <b>against</b> IgE-related <b>allergic</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTInterleukin- 33 (IL- 33) is {{a member}} of the IL- 1 {{cytokine}} family, which includes IL- 1 and IL- 18. IL- 33 is considered to be crucial for induction of Th 2 -type cytokine-associated immune responses such as host defense <b>against</b> nematodes and <b>allergic</b> <b>diseases</b> by inducing production of such Th 2 -type cytokines as IL- 5 and IL- 13 by Th 2 cells, mast cells, basophils and eosinophils. In addition, IL- 33 is involved in the induction of non-Th 2 -type acute and chronic inflammation as a proinflammatory cytokine, similar to IL- 1 and IL- 18. In this review, we summarize and discuss the current knowledge regarding the roles of IL- 33 and IL- 33 receptors in host defense and disease development...|$|R

40|$|Chitinase inhibitors {{have been}} found to have {{anti-inflammatory}} potential <b>against</b> asthma, <b>allergic</b> <b>diseases</b> and various other disorders. In this study various naturally occurring chitinase inhibitors against human chitinase (chitotriosidases, CHIT 1) were studied with the help of protein-ligand docking. The structure of CHIT 1 was modeled by homology modeling tool and validated with the help of various computational tools. Following validation, secondary structure, function and solvent accessibility of the protein was analyzed. A molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study was conducted by GROMACS simulation package to study the stability of the structure. This was further followed by docking studies with natural inhibitors like allosamidin, argifin and argadin against CHIT 1 by GLIDE docking software. Argadin was observed to have the highest affinity (G-score =- 10. 955) towards CHIT 1 and allosamidin scored the lowest GLIDE score (G-score =- 7. 741). The structural behavior of the best inhibitor protein complex (CHIT 1 - argadin) was validated through molecular dynamics simulation studies. A structure based virtual screening {{on the basis of the}} binding modes of these inhibitor was performed and best scoring hits were identified. The sequence analysis can be further used for the designing of potent drugs against diseases caused by CHIT 1, thereby aiding knowledge in the field of researc...|$|R
40|$|Although {{several studies}} have shown that farmers and people with agricultural-related occupations have a higher risk of {{developing}} lung diseases such as nonallergic asthma, chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), it has also been shown that exposure to the farm environment is associated with a protective effect on the development of atopy and allergic asthma. In this thesis, both effects of farm exposures on the immune system were studied: the protective effect <b>against</b> <b>allergic</b> asthma and the induction of non-allergic asthma. These studies were conducted among agricultural workers, and in mouse models of allergic and nonallergic lung disease. In addition, the presence of several macrophage phenotypes in animal models of allergic and non-allergic asthma was investigated, as well as the effects of exposure to farm dust extract on a macrophage cell line. This thesis demonstrated that occupational exposure to a farm environment and exposure to farm dust extracts in mice lead to a shift in the immune system towards non-allergic inflammation. This shift offers on the one hand protection <b>against</b> development of <b>allergic</b> <b>diseases,</b> such as <b>allergic</b> asthma, but is also associated with the risk of nonallergic asthma development. In addition, this thesis shows that, within the various phenotypes asthma, various inflammatory mediators and cells are important in the development and severity of airway hyperresponsiveness...|$|R

It {{has been suggested that}} BCG vaccination may protect <b>against</b> development of <b>allergic</b> <b>diseases.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to identifying relation between scar of BCG vaccine and atopy. This cross-sectional study was done in 1000 children, 10 - 15 years of age, in Zanjan city. One thousand children (501 girls and 499 boys) were recruited in this study, 137, 121 and 141 cases of asthma, atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis, respectively were detected. Three hundred and three subjects had at least one of these disorders, which were diagnosed as atopy. There was reverse correlation between BCG scar and asthma (P= 0. 013), atopic dermatitis (P< 0. 01), and atopy (P< 0. 01). We did not find any association between the diameter of BCG scar and allergic rhinitis. Reverse correlation of asthma, atopic dermatitis and atopy with BCG scar are significant. This relied on history and symptoms of patients. Further studies with skin tests, measurements of total and specific IgE levels and spirometery are recommended...|$|R
