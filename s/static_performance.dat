50|$|At the Eurovision Song Contest in Frankfurt, the French entry was {{performed}} eighth among the ten contestants following Germany with “Telefon, Telefon” and preceding Denmark with “Skibet skal sejle i nat”. Paule Desjardins delivered {{a simple and}} <b>static</b> <b>performance</b> as usual in these days. In the background, the stage showed {{a picture of a}} street café typically for Paris to illustrate the country the song represents. Being a hot favourite, France finished second among the ten contestants. At the close of voting, it has received 17 points, almost only half of the points the Dutch winner received (31 points). Six countries gave points to the French entry, which means two thirds exactly of the other countries. The French jury itself gave only two countries any points: the Netherlands and most notably six points to Germany, by far the highest mark for the host country. Remarkably, France has also got its highest vote from Germany - again six points.|$|E
5000|$|The book {{exhibits}} {{a version of}} postmodern eclecticism, alternating poetry with prose parts. Despite its postmodern affinities, it can be construed, however, {{in line with the}} High Modernist tradition setting aside the postmodern playfulness for a serious and earnest handling of subject. The text develops in a series of intermittent monologues interspersed with biblical excerpts and the comments of the first-order narrator. The biblical elements together with vampiric and dystopian images work in tandem, creating a sense of foreboding and entrapment.Language is sparse and fragmentary, leaving enough loopholes to be completed by the reader and making no explicit mention of its vampire-related theme in order to reveal its storyline in a gradual and minimalist manner. Short declarative sentences are used to convey immediacy and facticity in the depiction of a grim world. Allusions and a wealth of cultural references are conveyed through sparse and seemingly casual monologues and which, at the same time, account for the text heading simultaneously at different directions. On occasions, the monologues seems to be ungrammatical and on others the characters seem to be turning back on their words. There is an effect akin to stream of consciousness, the text, however, develops in a linear way among the overlapping stories of the four protagonists. Ellipsis in narrative conjoined with simplicity of stage movement and the framework of a predominantly <b>static</b> <b>performance,</b> point to ritual as well as ritualistic theatre.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a framework for}} the generation of grid-shell structures {{that is based on}} Voronoi diagrams and allows us to design tessellations that achieve excellent <b>static</b> <b>performances.</b> We start from an analysis of stress on the input surface and we use the resulting tensor field to induce an anisotropic non-Euclidean metric over it. Then we compute a Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation under the same metric. The resulting mesh is hex-dominant and made of cells with a variable density, which depends on the amount of stress, and anisotropic shape, which depends on the direction of maximum stress. This mesh is further optimized taking into account symmetry and regularity of cells to improve aesthetics. We demonstrate that our grid-shells achieve better <b>static</b> <b>performances</b> with respect to quad-based grid shells, while offering an innovative and aesthetically pleasing look.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a framework for}} the generation of polygonal grid-shell architectural structures, whose topology is designed in order to excel in <b>static</b> <b>performances.</b> We start from the analysis of stress on the input surface and we use the resulting tensor field to induce an anisotropic non-Euclidean metric over it. This metric is derived by studying {{the relation between the}} stress tensor over a continuous shell and the optimal shape of polygons in a corresponding grid-shell. Polygonal meshes with uniform density and isotropic cells under this metric exhibit variable density and anisotropy in Euclidean space, thus achieving a better distribution of the strain energy over their elements. Meshes are further optimized taking into account symmetry and regularity of cells to improve aesthetics. We experiment with quad meshes and hex-dominant meshes, demonstrating that our grid-shells achieve better <b>static</b> <b>performances</b> than state-of-the-art grid-shells...|$|R
40|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the structural health monitoring system installed on the steel truss arch girder of Dashengguan Yangtze Bridge, the temperature field data and static strain data are collected and analyzed for the <b>static</b> <b>performance</b> assessment of the bridge. Through analysis, {{it is found that}} the static strain changes are mainly caused by temperature field (temperature and temperature difference) and train. After the train-induced static strains are removed, the correlation between the remaining static strains and the temperature field shows apparent linear characteristics, which can be mathematically modeled for the description of <b>static</b> <b>performance.</b> Therefore, multivariate linear regression function combined with principal component analysis is introduced to mathematically model the correlation. Furthermore, the residual static strains of mathematical model are adopted as assessment indicator and three kinds of degradation regulations of <b>static</b> <b>performance</b> are obtained after simulation of the residual static strains. Finally, it is concluded that the <b>static</b> <b>performance</b> of Dashengguan Yangtze Bridge was in a good condition during that period...|$|E

The designer can then assert the design goals on this system as constraints. Also, the domains (set of possible values) of some variables can be restricted to "realistic" values by asserting constraints. By checking the satisfiability of the constrained system, the designer can determine of the VLSI system meets all design goals.

40|$|ISBN : 978 - 1 - 4673 - 5542 - 1 International audienceReduced code {{testing of}} a {{pipeline}} analog-to-digital converter (ADC) consists of inferring the complete static transfer function {{by measuring the}} width of a small subset of codes. This technique exploits the redundancy that is present in the way the ADC processes the analog input signal. The main challenge is to select the initial subset of codes such that the widths {{of the rest of the}} codes can be estimated correctly. By applying the state-of-the-art technique to a real 11 -bit 2. 5 -bit/stage, 55 nm pipeline ADC, we observed that the presence of noise affected the accuracy of the estimation of the <b>static</b> <b>performances</b> (e. g, differential nonlinearity and integral non-linearity). In this paper, we exploit another feature of the redundancy to cancel out the effect of noise. Experimental measurements demonstrate that this reduced code testing technique estimates the <b>static</b> <b>performances</b> with an accuracy equivalent to the standard histogram technique. Only 6 % of the codes need to be considered which represents a very significant test time reduction...|$|R
