500|$|The {{character}} of Davros {{was designed by}} Nation to have created the Daleks in his image, and to also be a [...] "spokesperson" [...] for the Daleks as {{he felt it was}} [...] "boring" [...] listening to Daleks giving speeches. The design was inspired by the Mekon, a comic book character with no body but a [...] "green, dome-like head" [...] which Hinchcliffe remembered from his childhood. Davros attracted the attention of BBC prosthetics designer John Friedlander who agreed to come off another show to make Davros' mask. The latex mask was moulded to Michael Wisher's face by make-up artist Sylvia James. Wisher could even eat while wearing the mask. Regular latex instead of the more mouldable foam latex was used because the latter was too expensive. [...] The cast and crew regarded Davros' effects as a great technical achievement considering the budget and time period they worked in. Two children visiting Baker at the BBC studios were scared by Wisher in costume; they thought he was a statue at first. When sitting in Davros' Dalek-like base, Wisher wore knee pads and a kilt because trousers were too uncomfortable. To prepare during rehearsals, Wisher acted in a wheelchair with a paper bag over his head that only had slits cut out for his eyes so he would be used to the [...] "disorienting" [...] situation and be able to express himself without using his whole face. Wisher, a heavy smoker, put two holes {{in the top of the}} bag so he could smoke underneath it in rehearsals. Wisher also provided <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> for the Daleks with Roy Skelton; in some scenes, he was acting to his own pre-recorded dialogue.|$|E
