5|$|In 2006, Canterbury City Council began {{a public}} {{consultation}} {{to discuss the}} regeneration. A concern raised by the council is that the <b>shopping</b> <b>centre</b> is incoherent and fails to attract the tourists that come for the seafront. Other issues raised are the lack of holiday accommodation, car parks and clear pedestrian routes between the three main attractions in the town: the seafront, Memorial park and <b>shopping</b> <b>centre.</b> The council is considering relocating the sports centre from the pier {{and replacing it with}} other tourist attractions.|$|E
5|$|The main <b>shopping</b> <b>centre</b> in Sale, the Square <b>Shopping</b> <b>Centre,</b> was {{constructed}} in the 1960s. Following the Trafford Centre's opening in 1998, {{it was expected that}} the centre would suffer, but it has since prospered. In 2003 the Square <b>Shopping</b> <b>Centre</b> underwent a £7million refurbishment, {{a major part of the}} redevelopment of Sale's town centre. It was sold for £40M in 2005, by which time the Square had experienced an increase in trade and demand for tenancy that had led to an increase of 70% in rental income. The town's economy expanded to the extent that in 2007, at a time when the rest of south Manchester was oversupplied with office space, Sale's available office and commercial space was at an all-time low because of high demand.|$|E

40|$|This {{discussion}} {{studies the}} application of barrier-free facilities in <b>shopping</b> <b>centres</b> in Hong Kong. Through literature review of “barrier-free” concept and the oversea examples, the meaning of “barrier-free” is discussed. This study targets three categories of <b>shopping</b> <b>centres</b> namely <b>shopping</b> centers owned by The Hong Kong Housing Authority (the Housing Authority), <b>shopping</b> <b>centres</b> owned and managed by the Link and <b>shopping</b> <b>centres</b> privately owned by single developer. Via literature review, a questionnaire survey on disabled people about their general comments to different <b>shopping</b> <b>centres</b> and a site survey conducted to the six <b>shopping</b> <b>centres</b> {{from the perspective of}} property manager, {{the application of}} barrier-free facilities in two <b>shopping</b> <b>centres</b> of each category are examined. Research questions are raised and answered: what are facility users’ comments to each category of <b>shopping</b> <b>centres</b> when they were interviewed? Is there a relationship between the performance on facility categories and different <b>shopping</b> <b>centres?</b> Do the users’ comments differ from those of a property manager? Is there any difference between <b>shopping</b> <b>centres</b> managed by the same authority and why? What are major reason behind accessibility problems observed generally and how and who to improve the status quo? Sub chapter 3. 5. 1 reviews the questionnaire result that <b>shopping</b> <b>centres</b> owned and managed by the Link has the best performance in the application of different barrier-free facilities while the worst comments were given to shopping centers owned by the Housing Authority. Based on the questionnaire results, sub chapter 3. 5. 2 discusses the influence of business position of different <b>shopping</b> <b>centres</b> on the resources allocation, general policy and practice of barrier-free facilities based on questionnaire results reviewed in sub chapter 3. 5. 1. Sub chapter 4. 4. 1 discusses observation of uneven efforts on accessibility practices and facility application in different <b>shopping</b> <b>centres</b> under the same management authority after site survey in two <b>shopping</b> <b>centres</b> in each of three categories was conducted. Sub chapter 4. 4. 2 reviews the similarity in result of site survey and questionnaire survey conducted on the <b>shopping</b> <b>centres</b> owned and managed by The Link while the <b>shopping</b> <b>centres</b> owned by single developers are found to have worse performance on entrance accessibility as compared to questionnaire results. Observation of irresponsive attitude to overcome accessibility insufficiency is discussed in sub chapter 4. 4. 3. As the site survey exposes the lack of barrier free facilities and non-compliance with standards requirements in different <b>shopping</b> <b>centres</b> due to lack of advisory resources from the government, insufficient knowledge and skills of the management staff and lack of quality assurance in manufacturing and installation of barrier-free facilities, three suggestions are discussed in sub chapter 5. 2. 1, 5. 3. 1 and 5. 4. 1 including panel for registration and certification of quality contractors and service providers, vocational training and exchange of ideas, review on existing regulations for obligatory provision of barrier free facilities to improve the accessibility performance in different <b>shopping</b> <b>centres.</b> published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|R

5|$|The Chimes <b>shopping</b> <b>centre</b> {{was built}} beside Uxbridge station in 2001, {{incorporating}} {{many of the}} existing buildings into the new structure. The centre was originally to be named St George's Centre in plans {{dating back to the}} early 1990s, though this name was eventually taken by another <b>shopping</b> <b>centre</b> in Harrow on the Hill. Instead, The Chimes was said to refer {{to the sound of the}} bells from the nearby market house on the High Street. An Odeon cinema opened as a major part of the centre, with the smaller cinema at the opposite end of the High Street closing. Some houses on Chippendale Way and the St George's car park were demolished to allow for the construction of the new <b>shopping</b> <b>centre</b> car park. The offices of the local building company Fassnidge were also included in the new development; built in the 19th century, they now house a Pizza Express restaurant. Preserved timber from earlier demolished buildings in Uxbridge was used in the construction of a new building beside the former offices of Fassnidge, designed to resemble a much older structure.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} London Overspill plan, along wth {{places such}} as Ashford and Swindon, Basingstoke was rapidly {{developed}} in the late 1960s as an 'expanded town', in similar fashion to Milton Keynes. Many office blocks and large estates were built, including a ring road. The <b>shopping</b> <b>centre</b> was built in phases. The first phase was completed by the 1970s and was later covered in the 1980s, and was known as The Walks. The second phase was completed by the early 1980s, and became The Malls. The third phase was abandoned and the site was later used to build the Anvil concert hall.
