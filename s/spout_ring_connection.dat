50|$|The {{revolving}} part of alternators {{can be the}} armature or the magnetic field. The revolving armature type has the armature wound on the rotor, where the winding moves through a stationary magnetic field. The revolving armature type is not often used. The revolving field type has magnetic field on the rotor to rotate through a stationary armature winding. The advantage is that then the rotor circuit carries much less power than the armature circuit, making the slip <b>ring</b> <b>connections</b> smaller and less costly; only two contacts are needed for the direct-current rotor, whereas often a rotor winding has three phases and multiple sections which would each require a slip <b>ring</b> <b>connection.</b> The stationary armature can be wound for any convenient medium voltage level, up {{to tens of thousands}} of volts; manufacture of slip <b>ring</b> <b>connections</b> for more than a few thousand volts is costly and inconvenient.|$|R

50|$|The Erdinger Ring {{connection}} is {{to extend the}} S-Bahn (S2) from Erding {{in the direction of}} the airport and connect to neighboring Freising through a connecting curve, the Neufahrn Link. It will fulfill the demand of a rail connection between Eastern Bavaria, including the neighboring airport commuter cities Moosburg and Landshut, to the airport, realized with its own regional railway line. A faster connection from the airport to the inner city is not achieved by the Erdinger <b>ring</b> <b>connection,</b> however a direct connection between the airport and the Munich Messe would be. For this, the S2 would also make a short route north of Messe München and have a stop North of the exhibition center.Already before the opening of the airport there were plans for a regional station at the airport. To this, a railway connection from Mühldorf am Inn is to be made between Erding and Dorfen with the help of the Erdinger <b>ring</b> <b>connection</b> as well as a short new construction single-track called Walpertskirchner Spange. The actual plannin phase for this also began, as in the case of the Erdinger <b>ring</b> <b>connection,</b> in August 2006. On 29 August 2013, the Bavarian Administrative Court rejected the complaints against the plan approval decision of the Neufahrn Link of October 2012 and therefore freed the way for a direct rail connection of the Munich airport from Regensburg, Landshut, Moosburg and Freising. The Neufahrner Kurve is to connect the railway line Landshut-Munich from Neufahr with the railway connection line Neufahr-Flughafen Munich, approximately 2.5 kilometers long, two-track and electrified section of the line. In the construction and financing agreement, signed by rail and free-trade in April 2013, it was agreed that the Neufahrn Link will be built and put into operation by the end of 2018.|$|R

30|$|In recent years, chaos {{synchronization}} [1] {{of multiple}} chaotic systems has became a much-studied topic in nonlinear research area. It {{is in favor}} of its potential applications in multilateral communications, secret signaling, and many other engineering fields [2, 3]. Various kinds of synchronization of multiple chaotic systems have been discussed by using some advanced control techniques. Lü and Liu addressed complete synchronization of N coupled chaotic systems with chain and <b>ring</b> <b>connection</b> based on feedback control methods [4]. Tang and Fang extended the work of [4] to multiple fractional-order chaotic systems [5]. Chen et al. used the direct design method to study complete synchronization, anti-synchronization and hybrid synchronization among multiple chaotic systems [6, 7]. Sun et al. and Jiang et al. investigated generalized combination synchronization of multiple chaotic systems in [8, 9], respectively. Sun et al. discussed compound synchronization among four memristor chaotic oscillator systems based on the adaptive techniques [10]. For a special <b>ring</b> <b>connection</b> structure of multiple chaotic systems, a new transmission synchronization mode of multiple chaotic systems was proposed in [11]. Xi et al. proposed adaptive function projective combination synchronization of three different fractional-order chaotic systems [12]. It {{should be pointed out that}} most of aforementioned results are only concerned with the synchronization of multiple systems based on knowing exactly the system parameters, and the influences of unknown parameters for such systems are not considered. In fact, chaotic systems are unavoidably affected by unknown parameters, and it is hard to exactly know the values of the systems parameters in a priori. Thus, it is a challenging problem to study the synchronization among multiple chaotic systems with unknown parameters, which is the main motivation of this work.|$|R
