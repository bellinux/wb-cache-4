500|$|On {{her way to}} her ship, the {{computer}} orders Samus to leave {{the rest of the}} investigation to the Federation, which plans to capture SA-X for military purposes. Knowing that the X would only infect the arriving Federation troops and absorb their spacefaring knowledge to conquer the universe, Samus argues that the Federation is blind to the great danger the X pose and announces her intention to destroy the station. Although {{the computer}} initially intends to stop Samus, <b>she</b> <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> [...] "Adam" [...] and reveals that her previous commanding officer had died saving her life. Moved by Samus's revelation, the computer suggests that she alter the station's propulsion to intercept with SR388 and destroy the planet to destroy all X populations. Samus realizes that the computer is the consciousness of Adam Malkovich, uploaded after death. En route to initiate the propulsion sequence, Samus confronts an SA-X, defeats it, and sets the BSL station {{on a collision course with}} SR388. As Samus prepares to leave the station, she is stopped and attacked by an Omega Metroid. Samus is only saved by the recently defeated SA-X; she absorbs the nucleus of this SA-X and uses her newly restored Ice Beam to destroy the Omega Metroid. Her ship arrives, piloted by the Etecoons and Dachoras, and they escape before the station impacts the planet.|$|E
500|$|The {{impressive}} {{orange tree}} {{served as a}} metaphor for Stowe in Palmetto Leaves. <b>She</b> <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> [...] "the fairest, the noblest, the most generous, it is the most surprising and abundant of all trees which the Lord God caused to grow eastward in Eden", and compares it to her task of educating emancipated slaves. When she first arrived in Mandarin, from 1868 to 1870, religious services were held in the Stowes' home, with Calvin presiding and Stowe teaching Sunday School to both black and white children and sometimes serving as an acolyte during services. Stowe purchased a lot in 1869 to build a church for her neighbors that would double as a school to educate children, freed slaves, and anyone eager to learn. Though she encountered considerable frustration in dealing with the bureaucracy of the Freedmen's Bureau, construction was finished within a year and a teacher was in place, procured from Brooklyn, New York. Stowe had an organ that was rolled from her home to the church, but after it became too difficult to roll back and forth, they locked it in a closet in the school. The building burned down to Stowe's deep dismay, probably because of some drifters who spent the night in it and caught the southern pine wood on fire from carelessness, although Olav Thulesius suggests it was arson committed by Stowe's neighbors who did not appreciate her efforts to educate black children. After a frost in 1835, the orange trees in north Florida were killed, even underground, but they sprouted back only to be assaulted by insects, yet they recovered. While her neighbors helped to raise funds to rebuild the church, Stowe and the small community handed spellers to local blacks who were eager to learn. She decried the delay in the children's education: [...] "To see people who are willing and anxious to be taught growing up in ignorance is the sorest sight that can afflict one".|$|E
