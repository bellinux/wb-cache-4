The paper will promote the idea that the mission of libraries should include the taking on of a leading role in teaching environmental responsibility to the public. Because a “green ” image is a good image libraries should use their way of “going green ” to promote a powerful green image towards their stakeholders, customers and sponsors. The upcoming LIS future generation should be encouraged to spread the “Green library movement ” in their home libraries, their home library associations and their home countries...|$|R

40|$|Version {{of record}} first published: 19 Dec 2011 This article {{discusses}} the heuristic {{value of the}} concept of academic diplomacy {{in the context of the}} agency of the directors of the so-called foreign academies in Rome, with a focus on the Swedish Institute in Rome. Academic diplomacy is discussed in the context of the return to Italy of four German <b>scholarly</b> <b>libraries</b> in Rome and Florence during and after the Second World War. The article focuses on the role of Erik Sjöqvist (1903 – 75), director of the Swedish Institute in Rome 1940 – 8. It illustrates how the practice of academic diplomacy in wartime and post-war Roman scholarly contexts combined elements of the internationale of scholarship with national traditions. Academic diplomacy arguably provides a framework for discussing both individual and national agendas and prestige, as well as ideals of international collaboration. Transnational history is approached and discussed here through networks of individual scholars in the microcosm of foreign (as well as domestic) academies in Rome...|$|R

The author discusses the Modern Language Association's collaboration with Columbia University Libraries on CORE, or the Commons Open Repository Exchange.
