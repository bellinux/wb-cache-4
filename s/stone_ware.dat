6000|$|Presently {{the supper}} bell began to {{ring in the}} depths of the house, and the sound {{proceeded}} steadily upward, growing in intensity all the way up towards the upper floors. The higher it came the more maddening was the noise, until at last what it lacked of being absolutely deafening, was made up of the sudden crash and clatter of an avalanche of boarders down the uncarpeted stairway. The peerage did not go to meals in this fashion; Tracy's training had not fitted him to enjoy this hilarious zoological clamor and enthusiasm. He had to confess that there was something about this extraordinary outpouring of animal spirits which he would have to get inured to before he could accept it. No doubt in time he would prefer it; but he wished the process might be modified and made just a little more gradual, and not quite so pronounced and violent. Barrow and Tracy followed the avalanche down through an ever increasing and ever more and more aggressive stench of bygone cabbage and kindred smells; smells which are to be found nowhere but in a cheap private boarding house; smells which once encountered can never be forgotten; smells which encountered generations later are instantly recognizable, but never recognizable with pleasure. To Tracy these odors were suffocating, horrible, almost unendurable; but he held his peace and said nothing. Arrived in the basement, they entered a large dining-room where thirty-five or forty people sat at a long table. They took their places. The feast had already begun and the conversation was going on in the liveliest way from one end of the table to the other. The table cloth was of very coarse material and was liberally spotted with coffee stains and grease. The knives and forks were iron, with bone handles, the spoons appeared to be iron or sheet iron or something of the sort. The tea and coffee cups were of the commonest and heaviest and most durable <b>stone</b> <b>ware.</b> All the furniture of the table was of the commonest and cheapest sort. There was a single large thick slice of bread by each boarder's plate, and it was observable that he economized it as if he were not expecting it to be duplicated. Dishes of butter were distributed along the table within reach of people's arms, if they had long ones, but there were no private butter plates. The butter was perhaps good enough, and was quiet and well behaved; but it had more bouquet than was necessary, though nobody commented upon that fact or seemed in any way disturbed by it. The main feature of the feast was a piping hot Irish stew made of the potatoes and meat left over from a procession of previous meals. Everybody was liberally supplied with this dish. On the table were a couple of great dishes of sliced ham, and there were some other eatables of minor importance--preserves and New Orleans molasses and such things. There was also plenty of tea and coffee of an infernal sort, with brown sugar and condensed milk, but the milk and sugar supply was not left at the discretion of the boarders, but was rationed out at headquarters--one spoonful of sugar and one of condensed milk to each cup and no more. The table was waited upon by two stalwart negro women who raced back and forth from the bases of supplies with splendid dash and clatter and energy. Their labors were supplemented after a fashion by the young girl Puss. She carried coffee and tea back and forth among the boarders, but she made pleasure excursions rather than business ones in this way, to speak strictly. She made jokes with various people. She chaffed the young men pleasantly and wittily, as she supposed, and as the rest also supposed, apparently, judging by the applause and laughter which she got by her efforts. Manifestly she was a favorite with most of the young fellows and sweetheart of the rest of them. Where she conferred notice she conferred happiness, as was seen by the face of the recipient; and; at the same time she conferred unhappiness--one could see it fall and dim the faces of the other young fellows like a shadow. She never [...] "Mistered" [...] these friends of hers, but called them [...] "Billy," [...] "Tom," [...] "John," [...] and they called her [...] "Puss" [...] or [...] "Hattie." ...|$|E

50|$|The word {{terracotta}} {{derives from}} the Latin word meaning burnt earth. Nowadays the word refers to all unglazed red earthenware objects.

They probably worked in a way similar to that being used today in Kasongan, near Yogyakarta and the one in Bali, where the figurines are sun dried. Then rice husks and straw heaped over them and set on fire. To attain a harder object the firing is repeated.

5000|$|The {{most obvious}} and most usual way for Black {{to meet the}} gambit is to accept it with 4...Bxb4, after which White plays 5.c3 and Black usually follows up with 5...Ba5 (5...Be7 and, less often 5...Bc5 and 5...Bd6, the <b>Stone</b> <b>Ware</b> Variation, are also played). White usually follows up with 6.d4. Emanuel Lasker's line is 4...Bxb4 5.c3 Ba5 6.d4 d6 7.0-0 Bb6 8.dxe5 dxe5 9.Qxd8+ Nxd8 10.Nxe5 Be6. This {{variation}} takes {{the sting out of}} White's attack by returning the gambit pawn and exchanging queens, and according to Fine, the resulting simplified position [...] "is psychologically depressing for the gambit player" [...] whose intent is usually an aggressive attack.

Instead White often avoids this line with 7.Qb3 Qd7 8.dxe5, when Black can return the pawn with 8...Bb6 or hold onto it with 8...dxe5, though White obtains sufficient compensation in this line.|$|E

50|$|Originally, the Dresden Heath {{was part}} of the expansive, {{continuous}} border forest between the Sorbian regions of Nisan and Milska.

50|$|Strání {{is located}} in an ancient mining area and an {{apparent}} settlement area of the <b>Stone</b> Age Corded <b>Ware</b> Culture (2900-2350 B.C.). During the Middle Ages, Strání was on the so-called Hungarian Way. This road was used by Bohemian troops as they marched to attack the Turks and Tatars in Hungary. After the mid-13th century it became an important commercial link between Hungary and Czech lands. By 1359, Strání was listed as a town in official records. In 1483, tolls were collected in Strání for the upkeep of the commercial road, and by 1492 Strání included 44 houses and 2 mills. In 1502, John Bernard of Kunovice conquered the area, including Strání, and his family maintained dominion over Strání until the Battle of White Mountain in 1618, when the Bernardi lands were confiscated by the Emperor because the family supported the failed rebellion against him. In 1625, the Bernardi land holdings were sold to the Lichtenstein family, which, as previously mentioned, maintained ownership of Strání until 1945. Until 1943, there was a thriving Jewish community in Strání, but in that year the Nazis deported all known Jewish Stránaci to the Theresienstadt concentration camp (Terezín). Even so, several buildings in Strání are still architecturally ornamented with the Star of David. One such example {{can be found on}} the rear façade of Sklipek, a local bar.|$|R

40|$|The common {{perception}} to deify {{stones and}} rocks is widely {{found in the}} heroic folktales, epics and myths of Oyirad. And, motifs of beliefs and customs related to rock worship too are variously narrated. In the Stone Age, stone was the primary tool {{in the process of}} production. Ancient people made tools such as axes and swords out of stone and used it widely in vocational occupations, day-to-day life and war. Because stones and rocks were connected closely to the life of people in ancient times, they were matter-of-factly conscious of them and so deified them. Especially, as stones with shapes different from that of normal ones were made objects of faith and awe, diverse cultures with beliefs in stones and rocks were formed. There are many instances found in the heroic folktales and epics of Oyirad that reflect the common perception concerning the role <b>stone</b> and bronze <b>ware</b> played in the history and culture of ancient society. That is an evidence of the trace left in the oral literature which has been passed down since the Stone Age. Stone culture and worship of rocks and stones have had a big influence on the heroic folktales and epics of the ancient age. And it is thought that examination into the origin of heroic folktales and epics would provide valuable suggestions about how the notions regarding stone culture of the Stone Age has deeply penetrated in there. Beliefs regarding rocks and stones are one form of ancient beliefs among the various ethnic communities of the world, and have had a great influence on those of Central Asia, in particular. It {{is for this reason that}} the reflection of stone and rock-related beliefs in the oral literature of heroic folktales and epics, etc. in considered to be a representation of the thought of people of that age.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{generate}} an exemplary simulation of an "import price shock" consequent to integrating the accession candidates into the EU, the model assumed that import of the 12 products defined would be cheaper by 10 percent; this assumption {{was based on}} Baldwin – Francois – Portes (1997), who expect the real trade costs to decrease by 10 percent {{as a result of}} the EU's eastern enlargement. (This decrease of real trade costs comprises direct effects on import prices – import duties, non-tariff trade barriers – and the consequences of keener competition due to a larger number of import competitors.) Given the intermediate input structure as outlined in the input/output table, lower import prices first affect the prices of purchased materials and services across industries. This in turn affects the relative factor prices at given wages (labour becomes more expensive compared to the intermediate inputs), and causes demand for intermediate inputs to grow and demand for employment to fall. However, if we consider solely the effects caused by factor demand, we will ignore an important macroeconomic response. The import price shock and shift in factor demand will in turn change the costs and output prices. A decline in import prices by 10 percent means that overall intermediate inputs will be cheaper by 4. 4 percent. This decrease in input prices will directly affect output prices, which will overall fall by 4. 2 percent. The change in prices for overall demand (– 6. 2 percent) will range between the reduction of import prices by 10 percent and the respective output price effect. This means a substantial improvement of the terms of trade which provides the foundation for a positive welfare effect in the relevant theoretical models. Because of the massive import response, the impact on domestic output will be much less significant than the effect on demand and may conceivably be negative in some cases (textiles, clothing, shoes, food, tobacco, mechanical engineering, <b>stone</b> and glass <b>ware).</b> If we assume that additional imports are triggered solely by outsourcing (and not by private demand as well), we get much higher positive effects of cheaper imports on domestic output. In this sense, the simulation experiment described here indicates the maximum possible outflow of domestic demand by additional imports; when imports become cheaper this can in turn be viewed as a positive welfare effect for domestic consumers. On average, the output across the industries considered will rise by about 1. 5 percent, and employment will fall by 1 percent. Positive employment effects are found only in the automotive industry, paper and cardboard manufacturing and processing industry and printing industry.
