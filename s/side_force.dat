25|$|If {{an engine}} fails during taxiing or takeoff, the thrust yawing moment will force the {{aircraft}} {{to one side}} on the runway. If the airspeed is not high enough and hence, the rudder-generated <b>side</b> <b>force</b> is not powerful enough, the aircraft will deviate from the runway centerline and may even veer off the runway. The airspeed at which the aircraft, after engine failure, deviates 9.1m from the runway centerline, despite using maximum rudder but {{without the use of}} nose wheel steering, is the minimum control speed on the ground (VMCG).|$|E
25|$|Another {{strength}} of P. dominula {{in terms of}} survivorship is their ability to suffer less nest predation than other Polistes. P. dominula is a less attractive prey for birds mainly due to its aposematic coloration and the relatively strong attachment of the comb to the substrate – typically tree branches or man-made structures. Unlike P. fuscatus, which is colored brown with a few faint, thin, yellow stripes, P. dominula is colored bright yellow with alternating black, similar to the warning coloration of Vespula germanica, a common and aggressive yellowjacket. In addition to their alerting coloration, P. dominula comb strength also contributes to their higher chance of survivorship. P. dominula might have an advantage over P. fuscatus against avian predators because their combs {{are less likely to}} be dislodged from the substrate by birds because the <b>side</b> <b>force</b> required to dislodge it is greater for P. dominula than for P. fuscatus combs.|$|E
50|$|Roll rate causes {{incidence}} at the fin, which {{generates a}} corresponding <b>side</b> <b>force.</b> Also, positive roll (starboard wing down) increases the lift on the starboard wing and reduces {{it on the}} port. If the wing has dihedral, this {{will result in a}} <b>side</b> <b>force</b> momentarily opposing the resultant sideslip tendency. Anhedral wing and or stabilizer configurations can cause the sign of the <b>side</b> <b>force</b> to invert if the fin effect is swamped.|$|E

30|$|From Figs.  5 and 6, we {{can find}} that when the train speed is fixed, the varying mean wind speeds have large impact on the {{fluctuating}} values of the wind speeds and aerodynamic <b>side</b> <b>forces.</b> However, when the wind speed is fixed, the varying train speeds have little impact on the fluctuating values of the wind speeds or aerodynamic <b>side</b> <b>forces.</b> These rules are applicable to other aerodynamic forces and moments.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation to}} determine the effectiveness of porosity for alleviating <b>side</b> <b>forces</b> on forebodies was conducted in the NASA Langley Research Center 7 x 10 ft High-Speed Wind Tunnel. The study consisted of a comparison of experimental force, moment, and surface pressure results obtained on a fineness ratio 5. 0 tangent-ogive porous forebody with 0. 020 in. hole diameter and 22 percent porosity with results obtained on a solid forebody. The forebodies were tested with cylindrical afterbodies. The solid forebody was tested with transition grit to simulate fully turbulent conditions and without transition grit to simulate free transition conditions. The extent of porosity on the forebody was varied {{to determine the}} extent of porosity needed to alleviate <b>side</b> <b>forces.</b> Static longitudinal and lateral-directional stability and surface pressure data were obtained at Mach numbers of 0. 2, 0. 5, and 0. 8. The angle of attack range was from 5 to 45 deg and roll angles from - 90 to 180 deg. The solid forebody exhibited large asymmetries at moderate to high angles of attack causing large <b>side</b> <b>forces</b> and yawing moments. The porous forebody exhibited no significant <b>side</b> <b>forces</b> or yawing moments at any angle of attack tested...|$|R
40|$|Asymmetric lee-vortices {{can occur}} on slender bodies at high angles of attack {{which can be}} {{obtained}} in fast maneuvers. These asymmetric vortices induce unwanted <b>side</b> <b>forces</b> and yawing moments which destabilize the body. Therefore, an active flow control device called “aerostrakes“ was tested experimentally which forces a fixed symmetric separation at the shoulder {{in order to build}} up a symmetric lee-vortex system thus reducing or even eliminating the vortex induced <b>side</b> <b>forces</b> and yawing moments. This device works the same way as strakes but with the advantage of being activatable when needed...|$|R

50|$|Telescopic {{cylinders}} {{are commonly}} restricted {{to a maximum}} of 6 stages. 6 stages are commonly thought to be the practical design limit as stability problems become more difficult with larger numbers of stages. There are exceptions however, with one pneumatic cylinder manufacturer successfully incorporating up to 9 stages in their cylinder designs. Telescopic cylinders require careful design as they are subjected to large <b>side</b> <b>forces</b> especially at full extension. The weight of the steel bodies and the hydraulic oil contained within the actuator create moment loads on the bearing surfaces between stages. These forces, combined with the load being pushed, threaten to bind or even buckle the telescopic assembly. Sufficient bearing surfaces must therefore be incorporated {{in the design of the}} actuator to prevent failure in service due to <b>side</b> <b>forces.</b> Telescopic cylinders must only be used in machinery as a device for providing <b>force</b> and travel. <b>Side</b> <b>forces</b> and moment loads must be minimized. Telescopic cylinders should not be used to stabilize a structural component.|$|R
