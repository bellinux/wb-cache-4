25|$|Every antiparallelogram has an axis of {{symmetry}} {{through its}} crossing point. Because of this symmetry, it has two pairs of equal angles {{as well as two}} pairs of equal sides. Together with the kites and the isosceles trapezoids, antiparallelograms form one of three basic classes of quadrilaterals with a <b>symmetry</b> <b>axis.</b> The convex hull of an antiparallelogram is an isosceles trapezoid, and every antiparallelogram may be formed from the non-parallel sides (or either pair of parallel sides in case of a rectangle) and diagonals of an isosceles trapezoid.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} pairs of {{parallel}} planes that each intersect the rhombicuboctahedron in a regular octagon. The rhombicuboctahedron may be divided along any of these to obtain an octagonal prism with regular faces and two additional polyhedra called square cupolae, which count among the Johnson solids; it is thus an elongated square orthobicupola. These pieces can be reassembled to give a new solid called the elongated square gyrobicupola or pseudorhombicuboctahedron, with the symmetry of a square antiprism. In this the vertices are all locally {{the same as those}} of a rhombicuboctahedron, with one triangle and three squares meeting at each, but are not all identical with respect to the entire polyhedron, since some are closer to the <b>symmetry</b> <b>axis</b> than others.|$|E
25|$|Coins {{can also}} be spun {{on a flat surface}} such as a table. This results in the {{following}} phenomenon: as the coin falls over and rolls on its edge, it spins faster and faster (formally, the precession rate of the <b>symmetry</b> <b>axis</b> of the coin, i.e., the axis passing from one face of the coin to the other) before coming to an abrupt stop. This is mathematically modeled as a finite-time singularity – the precession rate is accelerating to infinity, before it suddenly stops, and has been studied using high speed photography and devices such as Euler's Disk. The slowing down is predominantly caused by rolling friction (air resistance is minor), and the singularity (divergence of the precession rate) can be modeled as a power law with exponent approximately −1/3.|$|E
50|$|In crystallography, a screw <b>axis</b> <b>symmetry</b> is {{combination}} of rotation about an axis and a translation parallel to that axis leaves a crystal unchanged. If φ = 360°/n for some positive integer n, then screw <b>axis</b> <b>symmetry</b> implies translational symmetry with a translation vector which is n {{times that of}} the screw displacement.|$|R

25|$|However, in {{the real}} world, many bodies rotate, and this {{introduces}} oblateness and distorts the gravity field, and gives a quadrupole moment to the gravitational field which is significant at distances comparable to the radius of the body. In the general case, the gravitational potential of a rotating body such as, e.g., a planet is usually expanded in multipoles accounting for the departures of it from spherical symmetry. From {{the point of view}} of satellite dynamics, of particular relevance are the so-called even zonal harmonic coefficients, or even zonals, since they induce secular orbital perturbations which are cumulative over time spans longer than the orbital period. They do depend on the orientation of the body's <b>symmetry</b> <b>axis</b> in the space, affecting, in general, the whole orbit, with the exception of the semimajor axis.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} examples of a nitrosyl complex to be synthesized is Roussin's red salt, which is a sodium salt of the anion 2−. The structure of the anion {{can be viewed as}} consisting of two tetrahedra sharing an edge. Each iron atom is bonded linearly to two NO+ ligands and shares two bridging sulfido ligands with the other iron atom. Roussin's black salt has a more complex cluster structure. The anion in this species has the formula −. It has C3v symmetry. It consists of a tetrahedron of iron atoms with sulfide ions on three faces of the tetrahedron. Three iron atoms are bonded to two nitrosyl groups. The iron atom on the threefold <b>symmetry</b> <b>axis</b> has a single nitrosyl group which also lies on that axis.|$|E
500|$|The grim reaper curve [...] moves upwards without {{changing}} its shape.

500|$|Thus, if {{the energy}} E is {{negative}} (bound orbits), the eccentricity {{is less than}} one and the orbit is an ellipse. [...] Conversely, if the energy is positive (unbound orbits, also called [...] "scattered orbits"), the eccentricity is greater than one and the orbit is a hyperbola.

500|$|There are {{two other}} {{chambers}} on the second floor. Behind the Buddha Hall is the patriarch's alcove. The founder of any Vietnamese monastery is typically commemorated there, but in this case, Thích Minh Đăng Quang left no remains, so only his begging bowl and robe are present, protected by a glass enclosure. The bowl is smaller than usual and the robe is of a saffron-dark orange colour. Buddhists often prostrate before the two objects, although as the glass enclosure and the Buddha statues in the main hall lie on the central <b>symmetry</b> <b>axis</b> of the building, they do so at an angle so that their posteriors are not pointing towards the statue of the Buddha. Behind the patriarch's alcove is another chamber, the centre {{of which is a}} statue of the bodhisattva Ksitigarbha. Instead of being depicted with the typical staff with six rings around it representing the six realms of existenceKsitigarbha is shown with a [...] "wish-granting gem". To either side of Ksitigarbha are photos of deceased monks and nuns. To the extreme left and right are photographs and names of deceased lay Buddhists, and their ashes are stored in urns below the altar.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} recent {{interest}} in quantum confined holes in GaAs semiconductors {{as they have}} potential applications in electrical spin manipulation via the spin-orbit interaction, {{for the development of}} spintronic devices. As this is a developing area of research, further theoretical and experimental investigation is needed to form a complete understanding of hole spin behaviour in low-dimensional structures. In this thesis we conduct experimental studies in two different types of low-dimensional hole systems, fabricated on GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures: two-dimensional Hall bars and zero-dimensional quantum dots. We begin by investigating an unusual, non-collinear spin response of a 2 D hole system, grown on a low symmetry (311) A crystal plane, where applying an in-plane magnetic field generates a spin polarization perpendicular to the applied field. We probe this effect by performing tilted field transport measurements and demonstrate that this phenomenon only occurs along a low <b>symmetry</b> crystal <b>axis,</b> and is caused by the presence of an off-diagonal g* xz contribution to the g tensor. Next we turn our attention from the static properties of 2 D hole systems, and explore the dynamic, non-adiabatic spin evolution of 2 D holes in tilted fields. We show that the phase evolution of the Shubnikovde Haas oscillations is very different between a high <b>symmetry</b> crystal <b>axis</b> and a low <b>symmetry</b> crystal <b>axis.</b> We model the experimental data using two paradigms (the abelian Berry and the non-abelian gauge field) and demonstrate that our dataset can only be explained by the presence of a non-abelian gauge field. Finally we fabricate and characterize induced, lateral, gated quantum dots to isolate single spin states, including one electron quantum dot and one hole quantum dot. We perform 3 D simulations to visualize the effect of the depletion region down at the 2 D gas layer and optimized the quantum dot design to achieve a few-hole quantum dot. We tune the quantum dot down to the last hole and verify this independently with an integrated, quantum point contact charge detector...|$|R
