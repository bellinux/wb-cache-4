40|$|This study {{explored}} the nexus amongst government agricultural spending and its inherent volatility level, total capital employed and turnover <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agricultural <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{stock market and}} agricultural output in Nigeria. Time series data from 1978 - 2008 were employed. Data were analyzed using square of mean-adjusted relative change volatility estimation method, co-integration and error correction model and two-stage-least squares regression technique. There is <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> a long-run relationship amongst government agricultural spending, total capital employed and turnover <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agricultural <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stock market and agricultural output. Government agricultural spending is influenced by its lag (0. 42) and agricultural output (- 1. 94). Total capital employed in <b>the</b> agricultural <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stock market is influenced by government agricultural spending (0. 15). Total turnover <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agricultural <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stock market {{is influenced by the}} total capital employed in the sector and the volatility level in government agricultural spending (- 0. 03). Agricultural output is influenced by government agricultural spending (0. 09) and total turnover <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agricultural <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stock market (0. 23). Government agricultural spending stimulates <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agricultural <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stock market, while its volatility is an impediment. <b>The</b> agricultural <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stock market is an effective window policy makers can exploit to increase agricultural output...|$|R

5|$|Average wage {{rates in}} the Soviet Union were {{published}} relatively rarely. Some academics in the West believed this was because the Soviet government wanted to conceal low average earnings. Alec Nove wrote in 1966 (when wage statistics were published {{for the first time}} since the Second World War) that the lack of transparency surrounding average wages was intended to prevent Soviet workers from discovering the huge disparities that existed between wages in different <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet economy.|$|E

Participants such as exporters with products that are priced internationally, would be allocated free units.|$|E
5|$|Nurkse {{stressed}} productivity as {{the primary}} determinant {{of the size of}} the market. An increase in productivity (defined as the output per unit input) increases the flow of goods and services in the economy. As a response, consumption also rises. Hence, underdeveloped economies should aim to raise their productivity levels in all <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economy, in particular agriculture and industry.|$|E
5|$|Nurkse was {{in favour}} of {{attaining}} balanced growth in both the industrial and agricultural <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economy. He recognised that the expansion and inter-sectoral balance between agriculture and manufacturing is necessary so {{that each of these}} sectors provides a market for the products of the other and in turn, supplies the necessary raw materials for the development and growth of the other.|$|E
