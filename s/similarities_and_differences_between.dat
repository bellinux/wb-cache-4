The book incorporates: in depth synopses and reviews for all the episodes from Series 1 and 2; insights into {{the making of the}} series; examination of the <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> the new series and the 1970s series; a photographic guide to filming locations; and exclusive production shots.|$|E
5|$|The next larger scale, cell biology, {{studies the}} {{structural}} and physiological properties of cells, including their internal behavior, interactions with other cells, {{and with their}} environment. This is done on both the microscopic and molecular levels, for unicellular organisms such as bacteria, {{as well as the}} specialized cells of multicellular organisms such as humans. Understanding the structure and function of cells is fundamental to all of the biological sciences. The <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> cell types are particularly relevant to molecular biology.|$|E
5|$|Another {{unidentified}} parrot specimen, {{this one}} brown and housed in Cabinet du Roi, {{was described by}} the French naturalist Comte de Buffon in 1779 under his entry for the Mascarene parrot, in which he pointed out <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> the two. The English palaeontologist Julian Hume has suggested the possibility that {{this might have been}} a lesser vasa parrot, if not a discoloured old Mascarene grey parakeet (Psittacula bensoni). The specimen is now lost. English zoologist and author George Robert Gray assigned some eclectus parrot (Eclectus roratus) subspecies from the Moluccas to Mascarinus in his book A List of the Genera of Birds from the 1840s, but this idea was soon dismissed by other writers.|$|E

40|$|In {{the paper}} we have {{examined}} the constitutive content of the offense of refusal or evasion from collecting biological samples, with elements of <b>similarity</b> <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> the current <b>and</b> the old law. The comparative examination is useful as it allows the identification and application of a more favorable criminal law, in the case where such an offense is committed {{under the influence of}} the old law and it is to be finally judged after the entry into force of the new law. This work continues and completes the monograph “Offenses against traffic safety on public roads in the Romanian criminal law”, published in 2014 (Universul Juridic). The work can be useful to judicial bodies responsible for law enforcement, and academics from law schools (teachers, students and master students).

5|$|The game's {{story and}} its ending have been open to much interpretation; the ending was {{purposely}} left vague and unanswered by Playdead. It {{was compared to}} other open-ended books, films and video games, where the viewer is left to interpret what they have read or seen. Some reviews suggested that the game is {{a representation of the}} religious nature of Limbo or purgatory, as the boy character completes the journey only to end at the same place he started, repeating the same journey when the player starts a new game. Another interpretation suggested the game is the boy's journey through Hell to reach Heaven, or to find closure for his sister's death. Another theory considers that either the boy or his sister or both are dead. Some theories attempted to incorporate details from the game, such as the change in setting as the boy travels through the game suggesting the progression of man from child to adult to elder, or the <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> the final screen of the game where the boy meets a girl and the main menu where what could be human remains stand in their places.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, {{the debate}} that {{immediately}} followed the publication of On the Origin of Species centered on the <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> humans and modern apes. Carolus Linnaeus had been criticised in the 18th century for grouping humans and apes together as primates in his ground breaking classification system. Richard Owen vigorously defended the classification suggested by Georges Cuvier and Johann Friedrich Blumenbach that placed humans in a separate order {{from any of the}} other mammals, which by the early 19th century had become the orthodox view. On the other hand, Thomas Henry Huxley sought to demonstrate a close anatomical relationship between humans and apes. In one famous incident, which became known as the Great Hippocampus Question, Huxley showed that Owen was mistaken in claiming that the brains of gorillas lacked a structure present in human brains. Huxley summarized his argument in his highly influential 1863 book Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature. Another viewpoint was advocated by Lyell and Alfred Russel Wallace. They agreed that humans shared a common ancestor with apes, but questioned whether any purely materialistic mechanism could account for all the differences between humans and apes, especially some aspects of the human mind.|$|E

500|$|A diaphonemic {{inventory}} is {{a specific}} diasystem (a term popularized by Uriel Weinreich) that superimposes dialectal contrasts to access all contrasts in all dialects that are included. [...] This consists of a shared core inventory and, when accounting for contrasts not made by all dialects (whether they are historical contrasts that have been lost or innovative ones not made in all varieties [...] ), only as many contrasts as are needed. The diaphonemic approach gets away from the assumption that linguistic communities are homogeneous, allows multiple varieties to be described in the same terms (something important for situations where people have abilities {{in more than one}} variety), and helps in ascertaining where speakers make diaphonic identifications as a result of <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> the varieties involved.|$|E

500|$|Many {{types of}} mimicry have been described. An {{overview}} of each follows, highlighting the <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> the various forms. Classification is {{often based on}} function {{with respect to the}} mimic (e.g., avoiding harm). Some cases may belong to more than one class, e.g., automimicry and aggressive mimicry are not mutually exclusive, as one describes the species relationship between model and mimic, while the other describes the function for the mimic (obtaining food). The terminology used is not without debate and attempts to clarify have led to new terms being included. The term [...] "masquerade" [...] is sometimes used when the model is inanimate but it is differentiated from [...] "crypsis" [...] in its strict sense by the potential response of the signal receiver. In crypsis the receiver is assumed to not respond while a masquerader confuses the recognition system of the receiver that would otherwise seek the signaller. In the other forms of mimicry, the signal is not filtered out by the sensory system of the receiver. These are not mutually exclusive and in the evolution of wasp-like appearance, {{it has been argued that}} insects evolve to masquerade wasps since predatory wasps do not attack each other but this mimetic resemblance also deters vertebrate predators.|$|E
