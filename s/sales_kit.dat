5000|$|Malick, a protégé of Arthur Penn's (whom {{he thanked}} in the film's end credits), {{began work on}} Badlands after his second year {{attending}} the American Film Institute. In 1970, Malick, at age 27, began working on the screenplay during a road trip. [...] "I wrote and, at the same time, developed a kind of <b>sales</b> <b>kit</b> with slides and video tape of actors, all {{with a view to}} presenting investors with something that would look ready to shoot," [...] Malick said. [...] "To my surprise, they didn't pay too much attention to it; they invested on faith. I raised about half the money and executive producer Edward Pressman the other half." [...] Malick paid $25,000 of his own funds. The remainder of his share was raised from professionals such as doctors and dentists. Badlands was the first feature film that Malick had written for himself to direct.|$|E

40|$|Packaging is {{typically}} the last task in a production process, especially in an assembly system. If an assembled product is {{sold as a}} single unit, its packaging is normally performed by the last workstation, {{in order to obtain}} a ready-for-sale product. Moreover, assembled product often comes with its accessories, packaged all together and supplied to the customer as a single unit: a <b>sales</b> <b>kit.</b> Due to the variety of products and accessories, the variety of kits is continuously increasing, requiring a complex definition of the best packaging strategy to adopt. The present paper aims to analyse the packaging problem in a production system, identifying and comparing the packaging strategies. These strategies provide, through a comparison model of total cost functions, a decision-making procedure for operations managers. Through a simulative study, a set of convenience areas for each analysed packaging strategy is derived. The findings from an industrial case study are also reported to validate the proposed methodolog...|$|E

5000|$|In 2006, {{as part of}} Mayor Michael Bloomberg's {{gun control}} efforts, the city {{approved}} new legislation regulating handgun possession and sales. The new laws established a gun offender registry, required city gun dealers to inspect their inventories and file reports to the police twice a year, and limited individual handgun purchases to once every 90 days. The regulations also banned the use and <b>sale</b> of <b>kits</b> used to paint guns in bright or fluorescent colors, {{on the grounds that}} such kits could be used to disguise real guns as toys. In April, along with Boston mayor Thomas Menino, Bloomberg co-founded Mayors Against Illegal Guns. A December 2013 press release by the group said the bipartisan coalition included over 1,000 mayors. As mayor, Bloomberg increased the mandatory minimum sentence for illegal possession of a loaded handgun, saying: [...] "Illegal guns don't belong on our streets and we're sending that message loud and clear. We're determined to see that gun dealers who break the law are held accountable, and that criminals who carry illegal loaded guns serve serious time behind bars." [...] He opposes the death penalty, saying he would [...] "rather lock somebody up and throw away the key and put them in hard labor." ...|$|R

50|$|In 1998, the Rogers {{name was}} {{acquired}} by the Brook Mays Music Company ("BMMC") of Dallas, TX. Jim Rosenthal, then VP Marketing for BMMC identified the opportunity to purchase the name and revitalize the brand. BMMC began the brand as a low-cost, but high quality import line of beginner drum sets that were sold exclusively through the company's own chain of music stores. The first kits were manufactured by Peace Drums of Taiwan. The drums sold successfully because many drummers (especially younger ones) wanted Rogers kits and the kits were excellent value. Bill Crowden, son-in-law of Bill Ludwig, was working for BMMC {{at the time and}} was brought in to the Dallas office to run Rogers. Together with Jim Rosenthal, they developed the line, using names of Rogers kits and drums from the '60s. A high-quality line of kits emerged that included maple and birch shells with beavertail lugs and modern double-braced hardware. <b>Sales</b> of Rogers <b>kits</b> across the board for BMMC were extremely successful.|$|R
50|$|Severson {{maintains}} that, while {{conventional wisdom}} would consider the Kaiser Darrin a marketing failure, {{it really did}} not do that badly when compared to its competition in the sports car field. The Nash-Healey, which was also expensive, sold only around 500 vehicles between 1951 and 1954. Allard production was never more than 150 or so a year. Annual <b>sales</b> of fiberglass <b>kit</b> cars such as the Glasspar G2 and Woodill Woodfire were measured in the dozens. Severson adds that while the Corvette was produced in far greater numbers than either the Kaiser Darrin or its foreign rivals, Chevrolet’s greater marketing resources and stronger dealer network did not ensure brisk sales. Hundreds of unsold Corvettes remained at the end of 1954. The model did not become profitable for General Motors, Severson says, until it was equipped with a V8 engine and roll-up windows. With all this in mind, Severson concludes, the fact that Kaiser sold as many Darrins as it did was somewhat remarkable.|$|R
