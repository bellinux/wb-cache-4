The empirical characterization model comprising three major categories, namely (1) material characterization and ingredient identification, (2) fabric performance testing, and (3) biological safety and biological response to human skin, was established to characterize the cosmetic textile agent and the developed cosmetic textiles. This systematic characterization model is expected to provide a guideline for commercial sectors and researchers to identify and evaluate the performance of cosmetic textile agents and cosmetic textiles in a safety and objective manner.

40|$|In recent years, textile {{materials}} {{have also found}} applications in the cosmetic field {{as more and more}} commercial cosmetic textile agents are now available in the market. In this paper, one commercially available cosmetic textile agent (CTA) for <b>skin</b> <b>caring</b> benefits was used for making the cosmetic textiles. Systematic characterization methods were established to assess their performance in terms of material identification, fabric performance properties as well as biological safety and biological response to human skin. The experimental results showed that after the treatment of cosmetic textile agent, the fiber surface was covered with a thin layer of smooth material, thereby contributing several alterations to fabric properties and providing a better hand feel to human body. The durability of cosmetic textile was considerably satisfactory with respect to the abrasion resistance and washing cycles. The experimental results also illustrated that the cosmetic textiles might probably enhance the replacement of cells with the newly regenerated ones in the skin structure of human body, and thus provided a more efficient turning-over and replacement of skin components.
