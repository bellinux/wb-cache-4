Each junction forms a switch and the junction has a functional dimension in nanometers. The <b>signal</b> <b>wire</b> selectively {{has at least}} two different voltage states, ranging from a 0 state to a 1 state, wherein there is an asymmetry {{with respect to the}} direction of current flow from the <b>signal</b> <b>wire</b> through one junction compared to another junction such that current flowing through one junction into (out of) the <b>signal</b> <b>wire</b> can open (close) while current flowing through the other junction out of (into) the <b>signal</b> <b>wire</b> can close (open) the switch, and wherein there is a voltage threshold for switching between an open switch and a closed switch. Further, methods are provided for latching logic values onto nanowiresin a logic array, for inverting a logic value, and for restoring a voltage value of a signal in a nano-scale wire. Invented by Phillip J Kuekes." [...] U.S. patent 6,586,965 ...|$|R

50|$|Another {{source of}} ground noise is also caused by unequal induced current. If a {{positive}} <b>signal</b> <b>wire</b> and negative <b>signal</b> <b>wire</b> travel different physical paths to the amplifier input then {{the differences in}} induced currents will arrive at the amplifier input terminals as differences which will be amplified. Thus {{it is imperative that}} the positive and negative <b>signal</b> <b>wires</b> are dressed out {{in such a way as}} to ensure that they both experience equal induction from outside sources. Two popular methods include using coaxial wire (both conductors have the same axis of rotation everywhere they exist, and thus have similar inductive experiences), and twisted pair where the two conductors have the same axis of rotation (but don't always exist in the same path).|$|R

40|$|Every position-sensitive wire {{detector}} {{needs to}} solve the problem of wire positioning with a defined accuracy all over its sensitive volume. In particular, thin-walled drift tubes ("straws"), which are currently being attached to large detector units of several tens of square meters of surface, need to be equipped with wire locators along their <b>signal</b> <b>wires.</b> A wire locator has been developed together with an insertion device, especially for medium-sized drift tube systems, which significantly reduces the production time and avoids the danger of applying epoxy glue to the <b>signal</b> <b>wire.</b> The wire locator is being inserted in one single time-saving production step together with the <b>signal</b> <b>wire</b> itself. The proposed design is being compared to the rigid wire locators in use in the COMPASS straw tracking system at CERN. The investigation comprises both wire- centering capability and influence on the efficiency of adjacent detector regions, demonstrating the competitive performance of the proposed new system. Its sufficient mechanical reliability could be shown by means of an X-ray tomography; the attractively small influence on the drift field was determined in a test measurement using a silicon tracking system in a hadron beam.

40|$|This article {{proposes a}} completion-detection method for {{efficiently}} implementing Boolean functions as self-timed logic structures.

Compared to dual-rail encoding methods, CSCD can {{reduce the number of}} <b>signal</b> <b>wires</b> and transistors used by approximately 50 %. CSCD implementations improved performance over equivalent dual-rail designs because of: (1) reduced parasitic capacitance, (2) removal of spacer tokens in the data stream, and (3) computation state similarity of consecutive data variables.

5000|$|The first {{semaphore}} signals were controlled by levers {{situated at the}} signals. Some early signals protruded {{from the roof of}} the controlling signal box. Later, remote operation was effected by levers connected to the <b>signal</b> by single <b>wires</b> (UK), pairs of wires (Continental Europe), or pipes supported on rollers (US). The levers were grouped together in a building known as a [...] "signal box" [...] (UK & Australia) or [...] "interlocking tower" [...] (US). In the UK multiple <b>signal</b> <b>wires</b> were grouped together, and in station areas were commonly routed beneath platform faces just above rail level. The operation of a single <b>signal</b> <b>wire</b> would cause some of the adjacent wires to 'jangle', and this noise was one of the many characteristic sounds of railway travel until the gradual introduction of colour-light signals from the mid 20th century.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- In recent deep {{submicron}} VLSI design, {{signal integrity}} (SI) and power-ground integrity (PGI) {{have become very}} important to design in a short time. As a solution, we propose DEPOGIT, which is a new dense power-ground interconnect architecture that realizes more robust physical design integrity. This architecture is a method of running both the power and ground wires adjacent to the <b>signal</b> <b>wires.</b> This provides not only the general shielding effect but also explicit decoupling capacitance (decap) {{by means of the}} wires. Using this architecture also guarantees regularity, thus reducing manufacturing variations in interconnects. As a result of quantitative analysis performed using 90 nm technology node, we demonstrate that high-quality decap of over 50 nF in a 10 mm square chip can be obtained, the resistive IR-drop can be less than 20 % of that of a conventional power grid, transient peak noise can be reduced by about 80 %, and the inductive crosstalk effect of the <b>signal</b> <b>wire</b> can be greatly reduced...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} remove {{noise in the}} broken <b>wire</b> <b>signal</b> of <b>wire</b> rope, a new {{denoising}} algorithm based on the correlation of inter scales wavelet coefficient was proposed. Because the wavelet coefficient of signal has strong correlation and the wavelet coefficient of noise does not has obvious correlation, {{in the process of}} calculating threshold, an inter scales correlation factor was constructed considering the part specialty of next scale on the same position after wavelet transform. The proposed factor can adaptively adjust threshold on the position of signal and noise, thereby otaining good denoising effect and holding the break information in original signal. The actual processing effect of simulation and damage <b>signal</b> of <b>wire</b> rope shows that the proposed method, compared with the classical threshold, not only effectively removes noise in original signal and improve the signal noise ratio(SNR),but also retains the break information of inspected damage <b>signal</b> of <b>wire</b> rope...|$|R
