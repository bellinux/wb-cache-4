40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic investment model that explains {{differences in the}} sensitivity of small- and large-sized firms {{to changes in the}} money market interest rate. In contrast to existing studies on the firm size effects of monetary policy, the importance of firms as monetary transmission channel does not originate from credit market imperfections, but from size-related differences in the degree of investment irreversibility. The degree of investment irreversibility is determined by <b>sunk</b> capital <b>investment</b> expenditures. We show that size-related differences in <b>sunk</b> <b>investment</b> expenditures have two interdependent effects: they (i) affect the optimal investment behavior of small- and large-sized firms and (ii) account for differences in the interest rate sensitivity of small- and large-firm investment. We illustrate that <b>sunk</b> <b>investment</b> expenditures affect the region of zero and non-zero investment activity and, hence, the frequency at which large and small firms change <b>investment</b> regimes. Furthermore, <b>sunk</b> <b>investment</b> costs {{determine the extent to which}} small- and large-firm investment displays discrete jumps. We find that large firms change investment regimes less frequently than small firms and that swings in investment are more accentuated for large than for small firms. We illustrate that the response of small- and large-firm investment to monetary policy actions depends on the magnitude of the monetary policy shock.

Rationing is ex post inefficient, but it gives more surplus to lower-value customers who are the marginal consumers the monopolists want to tempt to make investments. Similarly, a monopsonist may procure some requirements from high-cost "second sources" rather than purchase only from the lowest-cost suppliers.

40|$|The {{received}} {{wisdom is}} that sunk costs create a barrier to entry - if entry fails, then the entrant, unable to recover sunk costs, incurs greater losses. In a strategic context where an incumbent may prey on the entrant, sunk entry costs have a countervailing effect: they may effectively commit the entrant {{to stay in the}} market. By providing the entrant with commitment power, <b>sunk</b> <b>investments</b> may soften the reactions of incumbents. The net effect may imply that entry is more profitable when sunk costs are greater. barriers to entry; sunk costs...|$|E

This hypothesis explains many of the practices of regulators which make little or no sense under conventional economic theory, such as the desire to pursue stable prices, the aversion to Ramsey pricing, and the role of incremental cost as a pricing floor. ...|$|E

Using a simple economic model we show that the optimal pricing policy involves a two-part payment: a price equal to the marginal cost of the patient whose benefit of treatment equals the cost of provision, and a separate payment for the partial reimbursement of capital costs. Departures from this scheme, which are frequent in DRG tariff systems designed around the world, lead to a trade-off between the objective of making effective technologies available to patients {{and the need to}} ensure appropriateness in use...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} in investment theory {{emphasizes the importance}} of <b>sunk</b> <b>investment</b> costs, uncertainty in returns, and flexibility in investment timing. Allowing for the presence of these characteristics alters traditional discounted cash flow rules for when to invest.

It also discusses the implications for policy analysis and suggests that government programs to encourage investment may, in some cases, be inappropriate. After discussing a wide array of possible applications, we focus on one in particular: programs to encourage energy-efficient investment. The examples suggest the importance of applying the new investment theory for economic analysis of investment in energy-efficient technologies. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} the competitive environment faced by depository institutions and the decisions these institutions make regarding the size of their branch networks. Specifically, we consider branches as a <b>sunk</b> <b>investment</b> that potentially increases utility for consumers and examine how local competition and product differentiation affect firms’ decisions regarding whether to make such investments. We account for endogenous market structure using an equilibrium structural model, which corrects for bias caused by correlation in the unobservables associated with market structure and branching activity. We estimate the model using data from 1, 882 concentrated rural markets. Our results demonstrate the importance of accounting for market structure and product differentiation, and are consistent with a potential entry-deterring effect of bank branch investments...|$|R

The present paper investigates the efficiency of incomplete contracts if individuals have heterogeneous preferences implying heterogeneous bargaining behavior and - equally important - preferences are private information.

The necessities of signalling are shown to generate very strong investment incentives. These incentives {{are based on the}} desire not to reveal information that is unfavorable in the ensuing bargaining. After finding all perfect Bayesian equilibria in pure strategies, the paper derives the necessary and sufficient conditions under which it is optimal to invest and trade efficiently. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the current}} low growth environment, {{accompanied}} by {{a high degree of}} uncertainty, calls for an even easier monetary policy have gained momentum. However, our model approach – which rests on the so-called theory of the "option value of waiting " – shows that the impact of monetary policy on growth and employment is strongly diminished in an environment of high (revenue) uncertainty. This finding is actually based on the existence of <b>sunk</b> <b>investment,</b> e. g. hiring costs. Against the background of the prevailing uncertainty, our model provides three important implications for ECB monetary policy: (1) cutting interest rates is not effective as long as high uncertainty continues to prevail; (2) by cutting rates under high uncertainty, the ECB reduces the option value of waiting, thereby reducing its effectiveness in future periods; and (3) a hectic ECB monetary policy, that is frequent interest rate changes, induces additional uncertainty to the economy which would most likely aggravate the weakness of in-vestment and consumer goods demand...|$|R

They do not affect correct (green) accounting method, which applies to both optimal and nonoptimal exploitation. <b>Sunk</b> <b>investments,</b> in development, exploration and knowledge, are the main source of non-convexity in petroleum exploitation, and cause further deviations from optimality conditions.

40|$|We {{describe}} the dynamic effects of wait-and-see real options on pricing {{in a competitive}} environment, whereby incumbents have already invested in a Next Generation Network (NGN), which is used for both competitive and regulated services, and also for existing and new services. Firms have flexibility over the timing and depth of penetration of next-generation services markets. We argue that because of intense competition, firms tend to behave cautiously by charging higher than optimal prices in the initial phases of development, so as to recover their investments as fast as possible. Therefore, the competitive diffusion path is too slow. This distortion can be corrected by rebalancing the allocation of firms ’ <b>sunk</b> <b>investments</b> between the regulated and unregulated market, thus leaving space for the industry to properly cultivate these uncertain emerging markets...|$|E
40|$|We analyse {{the interplay}} of policy reform and {{entrepreneurship}} in a model where investment decisions and policy outcomes are both subject to uncertainty. The production costs of non-traditional activities are unknown and can only be discovered by entrepreneurs who make <b>sunk</b> <b>investments.</b> The policy-maker has access to two strategies: ‘policy tinkering,’ which corresponds to a new draw from a pre-existing policy regime, and ‘institutional reform,’ which corresponds to a draw from a different regime and imposes an adjustment cost on incumbent firms.

Institutional reforms work best in settings where entrepreneurial activity is weak, while {{it is likely to}} produce disappointing outcomes where the cost discovery process is vibrant.

The example of containers also shows that network externalities {{play a major role in}} the use of standards, and that, on the other hand, worldwide standards with large <b>sunk</b> <b>investment</b> costs may lead to a lock-in.

40|$|Supplier {{relations}} play {{an important}} role in determining a firm's product market strategy and position, by affecting the cost and quality of the product produced by the firm. These relations are especially significant because the cost of purchased materials for an average firm is more than half its total sales. In this paper, we model the adverse incentives of a firm that sources from a competitive supplier industry. We show that a firm's propensity to behave opportunistically towards its suppliers raises the firm's input costs by decreasing the number of suppliers servicing it. This results in a suboptimal production decision compared to the firm's first best choice. We argue that an appropriate level of debt financing alters the shareholder incentives and mitigates the hold-up problem. Further, we also show that at the optimal debt level, the firm produces its first best level of output. Monopsony, <b>Sunk</b> <b>Investment,</b> Hold-up Problem, Debt Financing, Agency Costs...|$|R
