5|$|Belgrade has an {{extensive}} public transport <b>system</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> buses (118 urban lines {{and more than}} 300 suburban lines), trams (12 lines), and trolleybuses (8 lines). It is run by GSP Beograd and SP Lasta, in cooperation with private companies on various bus routes. The BusPlus ticketing <b>system</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> contactless smart cards began operating in February 2012. Belgrade also has a S-train network, BG Voz, now run by the city government (previous commuter railway network, Beovoz, was abolished around 2013). The main railway station connects Belgrade with other European capitals and many towns in Serbia. Travel by coach is also popular, and the capital is well-served with daily connections to every town in Serbia and to many other European destinations through the central bus station.|$|E

50|$|<b>Systems</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> {{automatically}} {{learning the}} rules {{can be made}} more accurate simply by supplying more input data. However, <b>systems</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> hand-written rules can only be made more accurate by increasing {{the complexity of the}} rules, which is a much more difficult task. In particular, {{there is a limit to}} the complexity of <b>systems</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> hand-crafted rules, beyond which the systems become more and more unmanageable. However, creating more data to input to machine-learning systems simply requires a corresponding increase in the number of man-hours worked, generally without significant increases in the complexity of the annotation process.|$|R

In their report, they argued that although the storm presented deep convection, an eye-like feature, and winds above 60mph (95km/h), the overall development of Grace was more similar to that of a mid-latitude non-tropical cyclone. However, operationally, Météo-France considered Grace to be a subtropical cyclone.

5|$|Between 1973 and 1978, {{together}} with Dutch researcher Stan Tempelaars (1938–2010), Kaegi developed the VOSIM program.

It complemented, and was used in conjunction with, Gottfried Michael Koenig's own computer-generated music programs Project 1 (1964), Project 2 (1966) and SSP (1971). Werner Kaegi summed up the VOSIM system in 1986 in a presentation for the scientific journal Interface.|$|E
