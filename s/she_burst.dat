5|$|As a child, Olga was {{described}} as a simple and chubby little girl with a broad face and big blue eyes.

5|$|Anne refused {{initially}} {{to appoint a}} new Lord High Admiral, and insisted on carrying out {{the duties of the}} office herself, without appointing a member of the government to take George's place. <b>She</b> <b>burst</b> into tears on the first occasion she was brought papers to sign in George's stead. Undeterred, the Junto demanded the appointment of Lord Orford, a member of the Junto and one of Prince George's leading critics, as First Lord of the Admiralty. Admiral Churchill retired, and Anne appointed the moderate Tory Lord Pembroke to lead the Admiralty, instead of a Whig. The Junto Whigs Somers and Wharton, however, were appointed to the Cabinet in Pembroke's vacated posts of Lord President of the Council and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The Whigs were still dissatisfied, and continued to pressure Pembroke and the Queen. Pembroke resigned after less than a year in office. Another month of arguments followed before the Queen finally consented to put Orford in control of the Admiralty as First Lord in November 1709.|$|E

The two wandered in the {{wilderness}} of Beersheba until her bottle of water was completely consumed. In a moment of despair, <b>she</b> <b>burst</b> into tears. After God heard the boy's voice, an angel of the Lord confirmed to Hagar that he would become a great nation. A well of water then appeared so that it saved their lives. As the boy grew, he became a skilled archer living in the wilderness of Paran. Eventually his mother found a wife for Ishmael from her home country, the land of Egypt.|$|E

500|$|Hindley's {{father had}} {{served with the}} Parachute Regiment and had been {{stationed}} in North Africa, Cyprus and Italy during the Second World War. He had been known in the army as a [...] "hard man" [...] and he expected his daughter to be equally tough; he {{taught her how to}} fight, and insisted that she [...] "stick up for herself". When Hindley was 8, a local boy approached her in the street and scratched both of her cheeks with his fingernails, drawing blood. <b>She</b> <b>burst</b> into tears and ran into her parents' house, to be met by her father, who demanded that she [...] "Go and punch him , because if you don't I'll leather you!" [...] Hindley found the boy and succeeded in knocking him down with a sequence of punches, as her father had taught her. As she wrote later, [...] "at eight years old I'd scored my first victory".|$|E
500|$|Marjory Stoneman {{was born}} on April 7, 1890, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, {{the only child of}} Frank Bryant Stoneman (1857–1941) and Lillian Trefethen (1859–1912), a concert violinist. One of her {{earliest}} memories was her father reading to her The Song of Hiawatha, at which <b>she</b> <b>burst</b> into sobs upon hearing that the tree had to give its life in order to provide Hiawatha the wood for a canoe. She was an early and voracious reader. Her first book was Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, which she kept well into adulthood until [...] "some fiend in human form must have borrowed it and not brought it back". She visited Florida when she was four years old, and her most vivid memory of the trip was picking an orange from a tree at the Tampa Bay Hotel. From there she and her parents embarked on a cruise from Tampa to Havana.|$|E
500|$|Fleming {{undertook}} {{a significant amount}} of background research in preparation for writing Moonraker; he asked his fellow correspondent on The Sunday Times, Anthony Terry, for information on the Second World War German resistance force—the Werewolves—and German V-2 rockets. The latter was a subject on which he wrote to the science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke and the British Interplanetary Society. Fleming also visited the Wimpole Street psychiatrist Eric Strauss to discuss the traits of megalomaniacs; Strauss lent him the book Men of Genius, which provided the link between megalomania and childhood thumb-sucking. Fleming used this information to give Drax diastema, a common result of thumb-sucking. According to his biographer Andrew Lycett, Fleming [...] "wanted to make Moonraker his most ambitious and personal novel yet." [...] Fleming, a keen card player, was fascinated by the background to the 1890 royal baccarat scandal, and when in 1953 he met a woman who had been present at the game, he questioned her so intently that <b>she</b> <b>burst</b> into tears.|$|E

500|$|The 17-year-old PedroII was, for his part, {{clearly and}} greatly disappointed. His first {{impressions}} were only of her physical flaws—and {{of how much}} her appearance differed from the portrait which {{had been sent to}} him. Physically, she had dark brown hair and brown eyes, was short, slightly overweight, walked with a pronounced limp and, while not ugly, neither was she pretty. According to historian Pedro Calmon, Teresa Cristina had no true limp, but her odd way of walking was instead the result of bowed legs causing her to lean alternately right and left as she walked. PedroII's high expectations were crushed, and he allowed his feelings of revulsion and rejection to show. After a short interval, he left the ship. Perceiving his disillusionment, <b>she</b> <b>burst</b> into tears, lamenting that [...] "the emperor did not like me!" [...] Although a proxy marriage had already been performed, an extravagant state wedding was held on 4 September at the cathedral in Rio de Janeiro.|$|E
500|$|The most {{dramatic}} interview between Mary and Knox {{took place on}} 24 June 1563. Mary summoned Knox to Holyrood after hearing {{that he had been}} preaching against her proposed marriage to Don Carlos, the son of Philip II of Spain. Mary began by scolding Knox, then <b>she</b> <b>burst</b> into tears. [...] "What have ye to do with my marriage?" [...] she asked, and [...] "What are ye within this commonwealth?" [...] "A subject born within the same, Madam," [...] Knox replied. He noted that though he was not of noble birth, he had the same duty as any subject to warn of dangers to the realm. When Mary started to cry again, he said, [...] "Madam, in God's presence I speak: I never delighted in the weeping of any of God's creatures; yea I can scarcely well abide the tears of my own boys whom my own hand corrects, much less can I rejoice in your Majesty's weeping." [...] He added that he would rather endure her tears, however, than remain silent and [...] "betray my Commonwealth". At this, Mary ordered him out of the room.|$|E
500|$|Olga was disdainful of {{her cousin}} Princess Irina of Russia's husband Felix Yussupov, {{the man who}} {{eventually}} murdered Rasputin in December 1916. Yussupov had taken advantage of a law permitting men who were only sons to avoid military service. He was in civilian dress {{at a time when}} many of the Romanov men and the wounded soldiers Olga cared for were fighting. [...] "Felix is a 'downright civilian', dressed all in brown, walked to and fro about the room, searching in some bookcases with magazines and virtually doing nothing; an utterly unpleasant impression he makes — a man idling in such times", Olga wrote to her father, Tsar Nicholas, on March 5, 1915 after paying a visit to the Yussupovs. She was also strongly patriotic. In July 1915, while discussing the wedding of an acquaintance with fellow nurses, Olga said she understood why the ancestry of the groom's German grandmother was being kept hidden. [...] "Of course he has to conceal it", <b>she</b> <b>burst</b> out. [...] "I quite understand him, she may perhaps be a real bloodthirsty German." [...] Olga's unthinking comments hurt her mother, who had been born in Germany, reported fellow nurse Valentina Ivanovna Chebotareva.|$|E

2500|$|The {{most famous}} passage in Burke's Reflections was his {{description}} of the events of 5–6 October 1789 and the part of Marie-Antoinette in them. Burke's account differs little from modern historians who have used primary sources. His use of flowery language to describe it, however, provoked both praise and criticism. Philip Francis wrote to Burke saying that what he wrote of Marie-Antoinette was [...] "pure foppery". Edward Gibbon, however, reacted differently: [...] "I adore his chivalry". Burke was informed by an Englishman who had talked with the Duchesse de Biron, that when Marie-Antoinette was reading the passage, <b>she</b> <b>burst</b> into tears and took considerable time to finish reading it. Price had rejoiced that the French king had been [...] "led in triumph" [...] during the October Days, but to Burke this symbolised the opposing revolutionary sentiment of the Jacobins and the natural sentiments of those who shared his own view with horror—that the ungallant assault on Marie-Antoinette—was a cowardly attack on a defenceless woman.|$|E
2500|$|Oilill died like {{a prince}} it was reported. [...] His head {{was cut off}} by a triumphant Fergus and was impaled on a lance and {{brought back to the}} fort at Rathmorgan to prove to Flidhais that she was now a free woman. [...] Fergus {{presented}} her husband's severed head as a courtship present to Flidhais. [...] However, Flidhais was overcome with guilt as she looked in Oilill's unblinking all-knowing eyes and she was horrified at {{what had happened to her}} husband. [...] <b>She</b> <b>burst</b> into tears and demanded his body be brought back to their fort. The troops retrieved Oilill's body and when Flidhais looked at his body, gashed all over and covered in blood, she was again filled with such remorse she began to recount his every worthy action during his lifetime. [...] Tradition maintains that Oilill is buried just north of Inver in a tumulus which is marked on today's maps as a 'mound'.|$|E
2500|$|The public's {{reaction}} {{towards the}} documentary has been positive. MTV asked various fans in New York and Los Angeles, California {{what they thought}} about the film, a fan quoted, [...] "It made me love her even more," [...] Shanna Birnbaum, 23, told MTV News. [...] "I think she was very honest. She really let her true self shine through. It showed people and young girls you can get through anything." [...] Stacey Medura, agreed, adding that [...] "For the Record" [...] humanized the pop star. [...] "It's easier to understand how she feels," [...] Medura said. [...] "Her opinion matters most.

[...] "I felt like this was the first time since <b>she</b> <b>burst</b> onto the scene a decade ago that she has spoken from the heart. ... I think this is what fans and others have wanted from her for a long time, to be honest.
