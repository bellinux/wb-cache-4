50|$|Tilia platyphyllos is a {{narrowly}} domed {{tree with}} a moderate growth rate, and can eventually attain {{a height of}} 40 m. The reddish-brown young stems later develop dark grey bark with fine fissures and furrows. The branches spread upwards at wide angles. The twigs are reddish-green and slightly pubescent.The foliage consists of simple, alternately arranged leaves. As indicated by its common name, this tree has larger leaves than the related Tilia cordata (<b>Small-leaved</b> <b>Linden),</b> 6 to 9 cm (exceptionally 15 cm). They are ovate to cordate, mid to dark green above and below, with white downy hair on the underside, particularly along the veins, tapering into a mucronate tip. The margin is sharply serrate, and the base cordate; the venation is palmate along a midrib. The pubescent petiole is usually 3-4 cm long, but can vary between 1.5-5 cm. The autumn foliage is yellow-green to yellow.|$|E
50|$|Parts of the {{ecoregion}} {{are located}} in smaller mountain areas surrounded by lower elevation biomes, {{as is the case}} with coastal mountains in Norway.At the highest altitude is high alpine tundra with very modest vegetation and bare rock, skree, snowfields and glaciers. At lower altitude is low alpine tundra with continuous plant cover; dwarf birch and willows up to 1 m tall and grasslands, as well as numerous lakes and bogs. At still lower altitude is the adjacent montane birch zone with small (2-5 m) mountain downy birch (Betula pubescens) above the conifer tree line; some stunted spruce and pine, and many lakes and bogs. This part is regarded as part of the High boreal (sparse taiga) vegetation zone; birch forming the treeline is very rare outside Scandinavia (also in Iceland and the Kamtchatka peninsula).At still lower elevations the forests become closed-canopy (mid-boreal, south-boreal), denser and taller (8-20 m, exceptionally 30 m) with more species including mature Scots pine and aspen. Sometimes much of the lowland forest near the fjords of Western Norway is also included as Norway spruce is mostly absent here (both Norway spruce and Sitka spruce are commonly planted for economic reasons). In these temperate forests are also species such as Quercus robur, Fraxinus excelsior, Taxus baccata, holly and <b>small-leaved</b> <b>linden</b> in addition to pine, aspen and birch. There might thus be a very large span in environmental conditions within this ecoregion; from temperate forest near the fjords with a 6-month growing season to the highest mountains with glaciers and snowfields not melting until mid-summer.|$|E

25|$|In {{the zones}} most subject to inundations, {{conifers}} are more rare, {{since they do}} not like in general the wetter zones. In these forests, one can find broadleaf trees such as the aspen, very common in the Lower Dalälven, but rare {{in the rest of the}} country. These forests also have English oaks and <b>small-leaved</b> <b>lindens</b> and the wetter forests are mostly made up of alders, birch trees and willows. The richness of these forests and in particular their undergrowth depends above all on the nature of the soil. The poorer soils grow blueberries, bog bilberries, wild rosemary and cloudberry, whereas the richer soils are home in particular to Lily of the valley, woodland strawberries, purple small-reed and yellow loosestrife.|$|R

40|$|Summary. Comparative {{analysis}} regarding micro-anatomic stomatal apparatus {{parameters of}} <b>small-leaved</b> <b>linden</b> (Tilia cordata Mill.) and birch (Betula pendula L.) from the wider area of Banjaluka (entity of Republic of Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina) {{in the course}} of two seasons was performed in this study. Sampling of selected plant species was made on trees which were located next to the road (city centre) and on trees located in the suburban forest estate of "Velika Gozna", near the city. One of the objectives {{of this study was to}} examine the impact of particular air pollutants on stomatal apparatus characteristics (stomata number, size of stomatal apparatus and pore). The obtained results indicate significant differences in the stomatal apparatus characteristics between Tilia cordata (Mill.) and Betula pendula (Roth.) as well as with respect to the origin of the examined material. Changes in stomata number and stomatal apparatus size in the examined species can serve as an indicator of their resistance to air pollution in urban areas...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHere {{we report}} a {{comparative}} {{study on the}} content and tissue distribution of polyphenols in leaves of <b>small-leaved</b> <b>linden</b> (Tilia cordata Mill.) and silver linden (Tilia tomentosa Moench) differentially galled by Phytoptus tetratrichus Nalepa (Acari: Eriophyidae). Data showed that {{at the beginning of}} the season (early July) : (1) the native level of leaf flavonoids (flavonols, anthocyanins, tannins) varied significantly being higher in T. cordata than in T. tomentosa, (2) eriophyoid mite abundance was markedly lower on leaves of T. cordata with 4 -fold higher levels of anthocyanins and 6 -fold higher levels of tannins than on leaves of T. tomentosa, (3) in relation to linden taxa and mite/gall density, the content of flavonoids altered differently: in mite-galled leaves of T. cordata both flavonols and tannins accumulated markedly (up to 1 % of leaf dry weight), whereas in galled leaves of T. tomentosa the increase of tannins and flavonols was much weaker (up to 0. 6 % of leaf dry weight), (4) due to P. tetratrichus feeding, the content of anthocyanins in T. cordata leaves decreased, while in T. tomentosa it did not change or it increased, depending on gall density. Results obtained suggest that {{at the beginning of the}} season T. cordata is a less suitable host for P. tetratrichus than T. tomentosa due to the relatively high amount of native leaf anthocyanins and tannins. Since the most responsive class of leaf flavonoids to P. tetratrichus feeding were tannins and flavonols, they are proposed as putative factors negatively affecting the performance of P. tetratrichus...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} {{was to assess the}} status of soil organic carbon in newly shaped soils called Velká podkrušnohorská dump in the Sokolov {{district}} and evaluate the information in relation to the physic-chemical properties of soils. Another objective was to determine the relationship between the stable and labile fractions of soil organic carbon. The amount of soil carbon (stable fraction) was measured in the solid soil samples and there was the analysis of basic physic-chemical parameters of the soil performed. The highest concentration of soil carbon was measured in the stand alders and larch. The amount of soil carbon (labile fraction) was measured in the water extract. The highest values were measured in the stand silver birch and alders. Based on this data the quotient of the labile fraction from the stable fraction was determined and the correlation of the labile and stable fractions was made. It was found out that the higher quality soils are located at the leafy trees, but it leads to leaching of organic carbon. The bulk density and coarse-grained soil fraction was determined from the physical properties and these data were used to calculate the stock of soil organic carbon. The highest value was measured in deciduous forests with <b>small-leaved</b> <b>linden,</b> in coniferous forests with larch. The stocks of soil organic carbon were converted into codes by land cover categories and the thematic map was created. It was found out that the leafy trees are much more appropriate for forest restoration, because they are characterized by the rapid initial growth, easily degradable plant litter and stable form humus. Deciduous forests are also characterized by more developed soil substrate, which is however unstable...|$|E
40|$|Studied {{a sample}} of the largest trees Siberian pine (Pinus sibirica), Siberian spruce (Picea obovata), Finnish spruce (Picea ×fennica), silver birch (Betula pendula) and <b>small–leaved</b> <b>linden</b> (Tilia cordata) subzone in the middle (“Vishera” Reserve) and in the subzone of the {{southern}} taiga (forest Perm) in the natural old–growth forests, only 82 pcs., Which are its parameters were close to the plus trees. Near these trees were determined 8 types of geo–active zones (hereinafter “zone”) using biolocation method. It was found that the largest trees in the Siberian pine forests of the reserve formed on a completely unique combination of these zones, with diameters of 1, 3, 4. 5 meters with zones of large diameters. 16, 32, 55 m in the same forests of large trees Siberian spruce were localized exclusively on another combination of zones, with diameters of only 1 and 8 m. Further, in the southern taiga, we have studied the large Finnish spruce trees in spruce and linden forest. They were localized on a completely different combination areas than Siberian spruce: 1 m and 3 – 4. 5 m, with preference zones 4. 5 m where the biggest linden trees always met on Zones 1 m and within chains of these areas, and. in the majority of cases they were combined with zones of 3 – 4. 5 m, with a preference for zones 3 m, indicating some differences in energy preferences spruce and linden. We were also studied biogroups one or two rocks; it turned out that they form 34 – 50 % of the large trees and the zone diameter 1 or 4. 5 m was located most often exactly in the middle between the trees. In this zone diameter is always greater than the distance between the trees, and may therefore be considered biogroups two trees with the distance of 4. 0 m even if they are located in an area with a diameter of, for example, 4. 5 m...|$|E
