5|$|Subtle {{problems}} with the executive functions of attentiveness, planning, flexibility, and abstract thinking, or impairments in <b>semantic</b> <b>memory</b> (memory of meanings, and concept relationships) can also be symptomatic of {{the early stages of}} AD. Apathy can be observed at this stage, and remains the most persistent neuropsychiatric symptom throughout the course of the disease. Depressive symptoms, irritability and reduced awareness of subtle memory difficulties are also common.|$|E
5|$|In {{people with}} AD, the {{increasing}} impairment {{of learning and}} memory eventually leads to a definitive diagnosis. In a small percentage, difficulties with language, executive functions, perception (agnosia), or execution of movements (apraxia) are more prominent than memory problems. AD does not affect all memory capacities equally. Older memories of the person's life (episodic memory), facts learned (<b>semantic</b> <b>memory),</b> and implicit memory (the memory of the body {{on how to do}} things, such as using a fork to eat or how to drink from a glass) are affected to a lesser degree than new facts or memories.|$|E

40|$|Classification of <b>semantic</b> <b>memories</b> using multitaper {{spectral}} estimation by Sebastian Dalin-Volsing The {{research on}} classification of <b>semantic</b> <b>memories</b> {{is still very}} young. Several methods have been tested ranging from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to electrocorticog-raphy (ECoG). This report describes an alternative way of classifying signals collected from an electroencephalogram (EEG) into categories using the Thomson multitaper method of spectral estimation, {{as well as a}} logistic regression model. The aim for this report is to expand the research field with an approach that complements the current options of classification. Data was distributed from the department of Psychology at Lund University, and the experimental paradigm was to classify three types of <b>semantic</b> <b>memories</b> (faces, landmarks and objects) based on their neural patterns. Based on the cross-validation from the mentioned methods, a classifier could successfully be trained for the ”faces ” and ”landmarks ” categories with an average success rate of 55 % and 51 % respectively. The classifier accurately responded to the onset of the stimuli (p < 0. 00...|$|R
25|$|It {{is known}} that autobiographical {{memories}} initially are stored as episodic memories, but it is currently unknown if autobiographical memories {{are the same as}} episodic memories or if the autobiographical memories become converted to <b>semantic</b> <b>memories</b> with time.|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} <b>semantic</b> <b>memory</b> disorders, one must first understand how these disorders affect memory. <b>Semantic</b> <b>memory</b> disorders fractionate into two categories. Semantic category specific impairments and modality specific impairments are apparent in disorders of <b>semantic</b> <b>memory.</b> Understanding these types of impairments will give insight into how disorders of <b>semantic</b> <b>memory</b> function.|$|E
25|$|Different {{diseases}} and disorders {{can affect the}} biological workings of <b>semantic</b> <b>memory.</b> A variety of {{studies have been done}} in an attempt to determine the effects on varying aspects of <b>semantic</b> <b>memory.</b> For example, Lambon, Lowe, & Rogers (2007) studied the different effects semantic dementia and herpes simplex virus encephalitis have on <b>semantic</b> <b>memory.</b> They found that semantic dementia has a more generalized semantic impairment. Additionally, deficits in <b>semantic</b> <b>memory</b> as a result of herpes simplex virus encephalitis tend to have more category-specific impairments. Other disorders that affect <b>semantic</b> <b>memory</b> - such as Alzheimer's disease - has been observed clinically as errors in naming, recognizing, or describing objects. Whereas researchers have attributed such impairment to degradation of semantic knowledge (Koenig et al. 2007).|$|E
25|$|Category {{specific}} impairments {{can result}} in widespread, patchy damage or localized damage. Category specific impairments {{can be broken down}} into four categories. Perceptual and functional features, topographic organization, informativeness and intercorrelations are areas of decreased functioning in disorders of <b>semantic</b> <b>memory</b> (Warrington and Shallice, 1984). Alzheimer's disease is a <b>semantic</b> <b>memory</b> disorder that results in errors describing and naming objects, though not necessarily category-specific. Semantic dementia is another disorder associated with <b>semantic</b> <b>memory.</b> Semantic dementia is a language disorder characterized by a deterioration in understanding and recognizing words. Impairments include difficulty in generating familiar words, difficulty naming objects and difficulties with visual recognition. Research suggests that the temporal lobe might be responsible for category specific impairments of <b>semantic</b> <b>memory</b> disorders. In addition to category specific impairments, modality specific impairments are included in disorders of <b>semantic</b> <b>memory</b> (Cohen et al. 2002).|$|E
25|$|A 2001 {{study showed}} {{evidence}} that illogical locations, characters, and dream flow may help the brain strengthen the linking and consolidation of <b>semantic</b> <b>memories.</b> These conditions may occur because, during REM sleep, {{the flow of}} information between the hippocampus and neocortex is reduced.|$|R
50|$|High {{doses of}} alcohol {{severely}} disrupt the storage process of <b>semantic</b> <b>memories.</b> Alcohol {{was found to}} impair the storage of novel stimuli but not that of previously learned information. Since alcohol affects the central nervous system, it hinders semantic storage functioning by restricting the consolidation of the information from encoding.|$|R
25|$|There are {{multiple}} theories about dream function as well. Some studies claim that dreams strengthen <b>semantic</b> <b>memories.</b> This {{is based on}} the role of hippocampal neocortical dialog and general connections between sleep and memory. One study surmises that dreams erase junk data in the brain. Emotional adaptation and mood regulation are other proposed functions of dreaming.|$|R
25|$|As {{described}} above, {{patients with}} anterograde amnesia {{have a wide}} range of forgetfulness. Declarative memory can be further subdivided into episodic and <b>semantic</b> <b>memory.</b> Episodic memory is the recollection of autobiographical information with a temporal and/or spatial context, whereas <b>semantic</b> <b>memory</b> involves recall of factual information with no such association (language, history, geography, etc.). In a case study of a girl who developed anterograde amnesia during childhood, it was determined that the patient ("C.L.") retained <b>semantic</b> <b>memory</b> while suffering an extreme impairment of episodic memory.|$|E
25|$|<b>Semantic</b> <b>memory</b> {{has had a}} {{comeback}} in interest in the past 15 years, {{due in part to}} the development of functional neuroimaging methods such as positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which have been used to address some of the central questions about our understanding of <b>semantic</b> <b>memory.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Semantic</b> <b>memory</b> {{is one of}} the {{two types}} of {{declarative}} or explicit memory (our memory of facts or events that is explicitly stored and retrieved). <b>Semantic</b> <b>memory</b> refers to general world knowledge that we have accumulated throughout our lives. This general knowledge (facts, ideas, meaning and concepts) is intertwined in experience and dependent on culture. <b>Semantic</b> <b>memory</b> is distinct from episodic memory, which is our memory of experiences and specific events that occur during our lives, from which we can recreate at any given point. For instance, <b>semantic</b> <b>memory</b> might contain information about what a cat is, whereas episodic memory might contain a specific memory of petting a particular cat. We can learn about new concepts by applying our knowledge learned from things in the past. The counterpart to declarative or explicit memory is nondeclarative memory or implicit memory.|$|E

Now think back to lunch the day before yesterday. Though many of the details are probably the same, you likely do not have trouble discrimi-nating between the two memories. This example highlights that episodic memo-ries, or memories for specific experiences, contain many details bound together in cohesive representations (Tulving, 1972; Ranganath, 2010).

40|$|Summary. For over {{a hundred}} years, it has been {{accepted}} that remote memories are less vulnerable to disruption than are recent memories. The standard consolidation model posits that the hippocampus and related structures are temporary memory structures, necessary for acquisition, re-tention, and retrieval of all explicit (declarative) memories until they are consolidated elsewhere in the brain. We review lesion and neuroimaging evidence showing that important distinctions exist among different types of explicit memory and the structures that mediate them. We argue that re-tention and retrieval of detailed, vivid autobiographical memories depend on the hippocampal system {{no matter how long}} ago they were acquired. <b>Semantic</b> <b>memories,</b> on the other hand, benefit from hippocampal contri-bution for some time before they can be retrieved independently of the hippocampus.

25|$|The hippocampal {{areas are}} {{important}} to semantic memory's involvement with declarative memory. The left inferior prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the left posterior temporal areas are other areas involved in <b>semantic</b> <b>memory</b> use. Temporal lobe damage affecting the lateral and medial cortexes have been related to semantic impairments. Damage to {{different areas of the}} brain affect <b>semantic</b> <b>memory</b> differently.|$|E
25|$|The {{cognitive}} neuroscience of <b>semantic</b> <b>memory</b> is a somewhat controversial issue with two dominant views.|$|E
25|$|Together, {{semantic}} and {{episodic memory}} make up our declarative memory. They each represent {{different parts of}} context to form a complete picture. As such, something that affects episodic memory can also affect <b>semantic</b> <b>memory.</b> For example, anterograde amnesia, from damage of the medial temporal lobe, is an impairment of declarative memory that affects both episodic and <b>semantic</b> <b>memory</b> operations. Originally, Tulving proposed that episodic and <b>semantic</b> <b>memory</b> were separate systems that competed {{with each other in}} retrieval. However, this theory was rejected when Howard and Kahana completed experiments on latent semantic analysis (LSA) that supported the opposite. Instead of an increase in semantic similarity when there was a decrease in the strength of temporal associations, the two worked together so semantic cues on retrieval were strongest when episodic cues were strong as well.|$|E
30|$|Collins and Loftus [1] {{proposed}} {{a model of}} spreading activation in semantic networks stating that specific <b>semantic</b> <b>memories</b> (e.g., raspberries) are organized into a larger network that comprises concepts (e.g., fruit). <b>Semantic</b> <b>memories</b> are then represented as nodes within these conceptual networks, and the semantic nodes (e.g., raspberry and strawberry) within a conceptual network (e.g., fruit) are more strongly interconnected through associative, bi-directional links than are semantic nodes from different conceptual networks (e.g., raspberry and automobile). The strength of the associative, bi-directional links varies between nodes within a conceptual network, with some connections being quite strong (e.g., raspberry and blackberry) and others being relatively weaker (raspberry and orange). Activation of any given node will spread along associative links to other related nodes that also comprise the network, spreading first to the nodes linked to the first node {{and then to the}} nodes that are linked to each of these and so forth. The strength of the connections between conceptual nodes is partially determined by production frequency norms or the frequency of use of the links.|$|R
50|$|Episodic {{memories}} (memories {{of moments}} or events) {{is a type}} of memory that may not undergo complete systems consolidation; as a result, they remain entirely dependent on the hippocampus (Sutherland & Lehman, 2011). Therefore, they cannot exist independently of any brain structures, unlike <b>semantic</b> <b>memories.</b> Evidence shows that complete hippocampal damage results in flat retrograde amnesia for episodic memories, including older memories (Sutherland & Lehman, 2011). However, if the hippocampus is only partially damaged, then it is possible for the amnesia to have a temporal gradient (Sutherland & Lehman, 2011) similar to one seen with <b>semantic</b> memories: older <b>memories</b> {{are more likely to be}} retained and newer memories less.|$|R

25|$|Networks {{of various}} sorts play an {{integral}} part in many theories of <b>semantic</b> <b>memory.</b> Generally speaking, a network is composed {{of a set of}} nodes connected by links. The nodes may represent concepts, words, perceptual features, or nothing at all. The links may be weighted such that some are stronger than others or, equivalently, have a length such that some links take longer to traverse than others. All these features of networks have been employed in models of <b>semantic</b> <b>memory,</b> examples of which are found below.|$|E
25|$|Various neural {{imaging and}} {{research}} points to <b>semantic</b> <b>memory</b> and episodic memory resulting from distinct {{areas in the}} brain. Still other research suggests that both <b>semantic</b> <b>memory</b> and episodic memory {{are part of a}} singular declarative memory system, yet represent different sectors and parts within the greater whole. Different areas within the brain are activated depending on whether semantic or episodic memory is accessed. Certain experts are still arguing whether or not the two types of memory are from distinct systems or whether the neural imaging makes it appear that way {{as a result of the}} activation of different mental processes during retrieval.|$|E
25|$|Participants {{are given}} a time period and asked to recall as many {{personal}} events as possible from that period. It assesses the ability to generate both personal semantic and personal incident memories. Recalling the personal <b>semantic</b> <b>memories,</b> participants try to produce as many examples of name of people known {{to them in a}} 90-second period. This is repeated for three lifetime periods: childhood, early adulthood, and recent adult life. Recalling personal incident memories, participants try to produce as many personally experienced events as possible in a 90-second period, and it is also repeated for three lifetime periods.|$|R
50|$|The theory {{posits that}} these differing ritual {{patterns}} promote {{the transmission of}} religious traditions by exploiting core memory processes. Imagistic rituals arouse strong emotion and generate vivid, flashbulb like, episodic memories, while doctrinal rituals repetitive nature means that rather than individual events the experiences over time are stored in procedural and <b>semantic</b> <b>memories.</b> Later formulations of the theory also emphasised the different forms of group cohesion that are generated by the two modes, with imagistic rituals promoting intense, relational bonds with the other ritual participants and doctrinal rituals promoting more diffuse, categorical bonds with larger communities who share the same identity markers.|$|R
50|$|Lesions {{that develop}} in {{neurodegenerative}} disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, interrupt {{the transfer of}} information from the sensory neocortex to the prefrontal neocortex. This disruption of sensory information contributes to the progressive symptoms seen in neurodegenerative disorders such as changes in personality, decline in cognitive abilities, and dementia. Damage to the neocortex of the anterolateral temporal lobe results in semantic dementia, which {{is the loss of}} memory of factual information (<b>semantic</b> <b>memories).</b> These symptoms can also be replicated by transcranial magnetic stimulation of this area. If damage is sustained to this area, patients do not develop anterograde amnesia and are able to recall episodic information.|$|R
25|$|<b>Semantic</b> <b>memory</b> is also {{discussed}} {{in reference to}} modality. Different components represent information from different sensorimotor channels. Modality specific impairments are divided into separate subsystems {{on the basis of}} input modality. Examples of different input modalities include visual, auditory and tactile input. Modality specific impairments are also divided into subsystems based on the type of information. Visual vs. verbal and perceptual vs. functional information are examples of information types. Modality specificity can account for category specific impairments in <b>semantic</b> <b>memory</b> disorders. Damage to visual semantics primarily impairs knowledge of living things, and damage to functional semantics primarily impairs knowledge of nonliving things.|$|E

2500|$|The {{next major}} {{development}} {{in the study of}} memory recall was Endel Tulving's proposition of two kinds of memory: episodic and semantic. Tulving described episodic memory as a memory about a specific event that occurred at a particular time and place, for example what you got for your 10th birthday. <b>Semantic</b> <b>memories</b> are abstract words, concepts, and rules stored in long-term memory. [...] Furthermore, Endel Tulving devised the encoding specificity principle in 1983, which explains the importance of the relation between the encoding of information and then recalling that information. To explain further, the encoding specificity principle means that a person is more likely to recall information if the recall cues match or are similar to the encoding cues.|$|R
40|$|Modified {{versions}} of the original Derived Relational Intrusions Following Training paradigm (DRIFT; Guinther & Dougher, 2010) were used to engineer <b>semantic</b> false <b>memories</b> and contextually-controlled <b>semantic</b> false <b>memories</b> in group data. Experiment I replicated and extended the original DRIFT paradigm by showing that interrelated conditional discrimination training (match-to-sample; MTS) could influence subsequent false recall {{even in the absence}} of tests of symmetry and transitivity. It was also found that false recall was especially likely among those participants whose self reports indicated awareness that the study list words shared a common conditionally discriminative function. Experiment II required participants to complete a contextually-controlled MTS training procedure in which study list words were assigned to participate in a functional equivalence class with one set of non-study words in one context but with a different set of non-study words in a different context. Subsequent transfer of the study list words’ remembering function to non-study words (i. e., false recall) was found to be dependent upon the context in which the free recall test was administered, thus demonstrating engineered contextual control of <b>semantic</b> false <b>memory.</b> PsychologyDoctoralUniversity of New Mexico.
