5|$|Palynology (the {{study of}} pollen), {{as well as}} studies of fossil megaflora and invertebrates, had {{initially}} suggested that the uppermost Cedar Mountain Formation – including the Mussentuchit – dated to the Albian stage. A 1997 argon-argon dating of <b>sanidine</b> crystals recovered from a volcanic ash layer in the upper Cedar Mountain Formation by Cifelli and colleagues indicated an age of 97 ± 0.1 million years, which was then considered to be just after {{the boundary between the}} Albian and Cenomanian stages. This is similar to the early Cenomanian age reported for the overlying Dakota Formation. Subsequently, in 2007, James Garrison and colleagues dated the volcanic ash layer passing through the Cifelli #2 Quarry – which is likely the same layer dated previously by Cifelli and colleagues – to 96.7 ± 0.5 million years ago. At an approximate level, the Cifelli and Garrison estimates agree with each other, thus indicating a Cenomanian age for Eolambia. Garrison and colleagues also re-analyzed the pollen assemblage from localities throughout the Mussentuchit, concluding that the assemblage spans the Albian-Cenomanian boundary.|$|E

The Socorro-Magdalena caldera cluster (SMCC) is 85 km long and 20 - 25 km wide. It parallels the southeastern flank of the Colorado Plateau and the WSW-trending San Agustin arm of the rift. Precise 40 Ar / 39 Ar ages of <b>sanidines</b> from the rhyolite ignimbrites demonstrate that the distended calderas become progressively younger to the west-southwest. Large volume ignimbrite eruptions occurred at 31. 9, 28. 7, 27. 9, 27. 4 and 24. 3 Ma. A large satellitic caldera, formed at 28. 4 Ma, is located 20 km south of the main overlapping trend. Moderately alkaline to sub-alkaline basaltic andesite and basalt dikes of Oligocene age (31 - 24 Ma, K-Ar, 40 Ar / 39 Ar in progress) form a large semi-continuous radial array that is broadly focused on the SMCC.

40|$|Abstract: Basinal {{successions}} of Cenomanian age in Western Europe {{are dominated}} by pelagic and hemipelagic sediments, and display conspicuous primary bedding cyclicity (couplets) which is attributed to climatically-controlled variations in carbonate productivity. Withinsingle basins individual rhythmic ouplets are widely identifiable and enable basin-wide decimetre-scale correlation. A high resolution ammonite biostratigraphy (aided by inoceramid bivalves) is used to correlate successions in separate basins, and allows a comparison of couplet numbers to be made. Couplet numbers are similar across Western Europe, in spite of {{an order of magnitude}} thickness variation, and the carbonate:clay ratios of beds and groups of beds are persistent and diagnostic of particular levels. Additionally, beds with distinctive ichnofabrics (e. g. abundant dark Chondrites) are regionally extensive in the basins of northern Europe. It has proved possible to construct a composite cyclostratigraphy for the Cenomanian, graduated by 212 precession units (mode at 21 ka), which indicate a duration for the stage of 4. 45 Ma. Corroboration of this cyclochronology comes from radiometric dating; the Middle Cenomanian basal A. rhotomagense Zone to the Upper Cenomanian basal N. juddii Zone contain 107 pre-cession couplets in Western Europe, giving a duration 2. 24 Ma.

40|$|Drilling in the Caribbean Sea during Ocean Drilling Program Leg 165 has {{recovered}} {{a large number}} of silicic tephra layers and led to the discovery of three major episodes of explosive volcanism that occurred during the last 55 m. y. on the margins of this evolving ocean basin. The earliest episode is marked by Paleocene to early Eocene explosive volcanism on the Cayman Rise, associated with activity of the Cayman arc, an island arc that was the westward extension of the Sierra Maestra volcanic arc in southern Cuba. Caribbean sediments also document a major mid- to late Eocene explosive volcanic episode that is attributed to ignimbrite-forming eruptions on the Chortis Block in Central America to the west. This event is contemporaneous with the first phase of activity of the Sierra Madre volcanic episode in Mexico, the largest ignimbrite province on Earth. In the Caribbean sediments, a Miocene episode of explosive volcanism is comparable to the Eocene event, and also attributed to sources in the Central American arc to the west. Radiometric 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dates have been obtained for biotites and <b>sanidines</b> from 27 tephra layers, providing absolute ages for the volcanic episodes and further constraining the geochronology of Caribbean sediments. Volcanic activity of the Cayman arc is attributed to the northward subduction of {{the leading edge of the}} oceanic plate that carried the Caribbean oceanic plateau.

40|$|International audienceStrong thermal {{quenching}} is observed from 77 to 550 K in the far-red luminescence of K-feldspars. This far-red emission, {{next to the}} emission in the UV-to-blue spectrum recorded for thermoluminescence (TL), is reported in most alkaline feldspars with a characteristic peak centered on 710 nm with a width of 100 nm. This emission was observed by cathodoluminescence (CL) at room temperature (RT) for more than 30 K-feldspars, ranging from volcanic <b>sanidines</b> to granitic microclines and sediments and it is attributed to an Fe 3 + impurity. Contrary to ‘blue’ emission in volcanic feldspars, the far-red emission displays very low anomalous fading (AF). This makes it attractive for dating purposes; however, it has weak natural TL intensity, even at saturation, which competes with the black-body emission of the heater plate. This {{is in contrast to}} an intense tunneling afterglow at liquid nitrogen temperature (LNT). Further observations show that the disadvantage of weak TL can be overcome. Photoluminescence (PL) under UV shows a very strong {{thermal quenching}} effect of the far-red emission from 77 to 550 K, which accounts for the above contrast. Near the LNT, the far-red Fe 3 + photoluminescence is at a maximum and is dominant over other emissions in the spectrum. However, as the temperature increases, the efficiency decreases, falling to well below one percent, whereas the ‘blue’ emissions remain stable. This thermal quenching effect in photoluminescence is paralleled in TL. After irradiation and during storage at RT, whereas the ‘blue’ emission in volcanic feldspars is affected by ‘fast’ anomalous fading, charge trapped at Fe 3 + centers as latent far-red emission is almost stable. As the TL evolves and the extant ‘blue’ emission is emitted, {{more and more of the}} trapped charge associated with far-red emission recombines non-radiatively, resulting in an efficiency for emission in natural TL that is less than one percent. A modified band model, which calls for 'hopping' conductivity during the storage, accounts for the anomalous fading. Trap emptying at lower temperatures should lead to better use of the stable latent far-red stored charge for the dating of volcanic deposits...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Four multicyclic complex calderas {{and smaller}} {{ignimbrite}} shields {{located within the}} Altiplano Puna Volcanic Complex of the Central Andes (APVC) erupted 13000 km³ of magma within the last 11 Ma. One {{of the largest and}} most complex of these is the Cerro Guacha Caldera. Ar-Ar age determinations and paleomagnetic directions suggest that the Cerro Guacha Caldera was formed by two major eruptions, caldera collapse, resurgence cycles and several smaller eruptions. Two major ignimbrites (> 600 km³) are found with ⁴⁰Ar-³⁹Ar from biotites and <b>sanidines</b> of 5. 65 ± 0. 01 Ma for the 1300 km³ (magma volume) Guacha ignimbrite and 3. 49 ± 0. 01 Ma for the 800 km³ Tara Ignimbrite. The last major eruption occurred on the western flank producing the 1. 72 ± 0. 02 Ma Puripica Chico Ignimbrite with a volume of approximately 10 km³. Characteristic remanent magnetization data (ChRM) for these ignimbrites show that the Guacha has reverse polarity, while the Tara is normally polarized and the magnetic fingerprints have allowed their current full extents to be identified. A conspicuous lineament of volcanic structures in the eastern part of the caldera, bordering a caldera moat, filled out welded ignimbrites and sedimentary lacustrine sequences suggest an earlier 60 x 40 km outer collapse associated with the Guacha explosive episode. A central graben formed on the Guacha welded ignimbrite is related to a first episode of resurgence. Evidence of a second 30 x 15 km inner collapse includes offset of welded Guacha ignimbrites and alignment of lava domes associated with the Tara ignimbrite.

40|$|The Baume (cave) Moula-Guercy, in {{southeast}} France, contains an important sedimentary sequence, {{which includes the}} remains of a cannibalised group of Neanderthals. The chronology of the upper layers of the cave is currently constrained by a thermoluminescence date of 72 ± 12 ka, obtained from a tephra deposit (layer VI). The middle and lower layers of the cave have been constrained by biostratigraphy, pointing towards the end of MIS 5 for the Neanderthal bearing layer XV. In order to refine the chronology of the site, we applied radiocarbon, 40 Ar/ 39 Ar, U-series and ESR dating analyses. Radiocarbon dates on bone samples from layer IV showed ages older than 50 ka. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating on <b>sanidines</b> from tephra of layer VI revealed, that these volcanic minerals derived probably from the Hercynian basement, and thus provided no tangible chronological constrain. Combined CSUS/ESR results on faunal teeth place layer IV at the end of MIS 3 to MIS 4, in agreement with the radiocarbon dates and in stratigraphic order with the thermoluminescence age for layer VI. Layer VIII, with only one sample, is tentatively placed to the end of MIS 4. The age estimates for layer XIV are not conclusive, preventing an age estimation for this layer. The younger age result for layer XIV does not agree with the stratigraphy and biostratigraphy of the site and more direct dating of material from this layer is needed to resolve this discrepancy. Located just below, the crucial Neanderthal bearing layer XV is placed to the end of MIS 5 and younger than MIS 6, in agreement with the climatological and chronological deductions from the stratigraphy and biostratigraphy of the site. Direct U-series analyses on two Neanderthal teeth agree with an age for layer XV corresponding to at least MIS 5 sensu lato. The U-series results on the Neanderthal tooth 3525 show that U-mobilisation even into small teeth is highly complex, but nevertheless give an indication that this sample corresponds to MIS 5 e. This is in agreement with the CSUS/ESR results from faunal teeth as well as the stratigraphy and biostratigraphy of the cave.

40|$|Timescales {{governing}} {{the development of}} crustal magma reservoirs are a key for understanding magmatic processes such as ascent, storage and mixing event. An estimate of these timescales can provide important constraints for volcanic hazard assessment of active volcanoes. We studied the Agnano-Monte Spina eruption (A-MS; 4. 7 ka; VEI = 4; 0. 85 km 3 D. R. E. of magma erupted) of the Campi Flegrei caldera, {{one of the most}} dangerous volcanic areas on Earth. The A-MS eruption has been fed by magmas varying from more to less evolved trachyte whose variable 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and trace elements features suggest magma mixing between two end-members. Ba zonation profiles of alkali feldspar phenocrysts have been determined through combined energy-dispersive and wavelength-dispersive electron microprobe analyses (EDS-WDS-EMPA). We focused on distinct compositional breaks near the rim of the crystals that likely represent the last mixing event prior to eruption. We always chose the steepest gradients close to the crystal rims, taking into account that any effects related to cutting angles or crystal orientation should give longer apparent diffusion times. Two different approaches were undertaken: (1) a quantitative Ba compositional profiles were measured by point analyses along a short transect crossing growth discontinuities and (2) grey-scale profiles were taken parallel to the acquired point profiles. Assuming that Ba dominates the backscattered electron intensities in <b>sanidines,</b> greyscale gradients can be used as a diffusive tracer. BSE images were processed using the ImageJ® software, in order to extract a numerical greyscale profile. In both cases, each profile was interpolated through a non-linear Boltzmann fit curve with the Mathematica® software. A few traverses done at angles smaller than 90 ° to the compositional boundary interface were corrected by multiplying the distance values by the sinus of the traverse angle relative to the vertical on the interface. Our preliminary estimates gave diffusion times from quantitative point analyses between 100 ’s up to 4000 years at 900 °C. At higher T (950 °C) these values reduce to a range from a few years to 600 yrs. Grey-scale profiles gave diffusion times of 400 yrs (900 °C) and between 60 and 70 yrs (950 °C). This comparison and the uncertainty in T values indicate that further work needs to be done to better constrain diffusion times. In the future we will use accumulated back-scatter images for higher greyscale (i. e. mass) resolution and X-ray cps profiles on Ba for a systematic comparison of these different approaches. In any case, it appears that short times scales down to years and decades since mixing and coalescence of distinct magma batches in the reservoir, is consistent with our data. Such timescales might represent the time required for the A-MS magma to collect from different magma batches into a reservoir of eruptible magma before eruption. From a volcanological and geochronological point of view, a centuries to decades timescale is in reasonable agreement with the reconstructed volcanic history preceding the A-MS eruption...|$|R

Regular, &# 8804; 1 μm-scale 'strain-controlled' perthitic microtextures coarsen, by up to 103, by a dissolution–reprecipitation process, producing microporous patch or vein perthites on scales &# 62; 100 μm. We have developed earlier studies of such reactions in alkali feldspar cm-scale primocrysts in layered syenites from the Klokken intrusion, South Greenland. We present new hyperspectral CL, SEM images, and laser ICPMS analytical data, and discuss the mechanism of such replacement reactions. The feldspars grew as homogeneous sodic <b>sanidines</b> which unmixed and ordered by volume diffusion during cooling into the microcline field at &# 8764; 450 °C, giving regular, fully coherent 'braid' cryptoperthite. At &# 8804; 450 °C the crystals reacted with a circulating post-magmatic aqueous fluid. The braid perthite behaved as a single reactant 'phase' which was replaced by two product phases, incoherent subgrains of low albite and microcline, with micropores at their boundaries. The driving force for the reactions was coherency strain energy, which was greater than the surface energy in the subgrain mosaic. The external euhedral crystal shapes and bulk major element composition of the primocrysts were unchanged but they became largely pseudomorphs composed of subgrains usually with the 'pericline' and 'adularia' habits (dominant { 110 } and subordinate { 010 } morphology) characteristic of low T growth. The subgrains have an epitactic relationship with parent braid perthite. Individual subgrains show oscillatory zoning in CL intensity, mainly at blue wavelengths, which correlates with tetrahedral Ti. Regular zoning is sometimes truncated by irregular, discordant surfaces suggesting dissolution, followed by resumption of growth giving regular zoning. Zones can be traced through touching subgrains, of both albite and microcline, for distances up to &# 8764; 500 μm. At &# 8804; 340 °C, the microcline subgrains underwent a third stage of unmixing to give straight lamellar film perthites with periodicities of ~ 1 μm, which with further cooling became semicoherent {{by the development of}} spaced misfit dislocations. Sub-grain growth occurred in fluid films that advanced through the elastically strained braid perthite crystals, which dissolved irreversibly. Braid perthite was more soluble than the strain-free subgrain mosaics which precipitated from the supersaturated solution. Some volumes of braid texture have sharp surfaces that suggest rapid dissolution along planes with low surface energies. Others have complex, diffuse boundaries that indicate a phase of coherent lamellar straightening by volume diffusion in response to strain relief close to a slowly advancing interface. Nucleation of strain-free subgrains was the overall rate-limiting step. To minimise surface energy subgrains grew with low energy morphologies and coarsened by grain growth, in fluid films whose trace element load (reflected in the oscillatory zoning) was dictated by the competitive advance of subgrains over a range of a few tens of mm. The cross-cutting dissolution surfaces suggest influxes of fresh fluid. Removal of feldspar to give 2 vol% porosity would require a feldspar:fluid ratio of &# 8764; 1 : 26 (by wt). The late reversion to strain-controlled exsolution in microcline subgrains is consistent with loss of fluid above 340 °C following depressurization of the intrusion.

Their dominant mineral, <b>sanidine</b> feldspar, very commonly occurs in two generations, i.e. both as large well-shaped porphyritic crystals and in smaller imperfect rods or laths forming a finely crystalline groundmass. With this there is practically always a smaller amount of plagioclase, usually oligoclase; but the potassium feldspar (<b>sanidine)</b> often contains a considerable proportion of the sodium feldspar (albite), and has rather the characteristics of anorthoclase or cryptoperthite than of pure <b>sanidine.</b> Rhomb porphyry is an example with usually large porphyritic rhomb shaped phenocrysts embedded in a very fine-grained matrix.|$|E

50|$|Volcanic rocks erupted by Parinacota {{range in}} {{composition}} from basaltic andesite to rhyolite. Andesites {{from the old}} cone are classified as hornblende and pyroxene andesites. Minerals found within the rocks include amphibole, apatite, biotite, clinopyroxene, iron oxide and titanium oxide, feldspar, olivine, orthopyroxene, pyroxene, <b>sanidine</b> and zircon. Not all of these minerals are found in rocks from all stages of Parinacota. Some of these minerals, such as quartz and <b>sanidine,</b> were {{at least in part}} formed by the inclusion of foreign rocks into the magma. Gabbro and granite are found as xenoliths.|$|E
