60|$|They rode on in silence. No {{one had a}} mind to speak, and the mournful soughing of {{the wind}} in the pine-trees seemed to check the words on every lip.

60|$|There was no trail. All {{before was}} red sand, hollows, slopes, levels, dunes, {{in which the}} horses sank above their fetlocks. The <b>wheels</b> <b>ploughed</b> deep, and little red streams trailed down from the tires. Naab trudged on foot with the reins in his hands. Hare essayed to walk also, soon tired, and floundered behind till Naab ordered him to ride again. Twilight came with the horses still toiling.|$|R
50|$|Ploughing too was a {{communal}} affair. The heavy <b>wheeled</b> <b>plough</b> needed for northern soils was expensive, as were horses or oxen {{to pull it}} so a team of horses and plough worked successive strips of an open field for different peasants. The long narrow shape of the strips reflected the difficulty of turning the team at each end. In addition to the open fields, each village or manor had common land where peasants had right to graze cattle, collect wood, cut turf and at times catch fish.|$|R

A cheaper, less conflated alternative could be to incorporate <b>single</b> <b>wheel</b> testing. The algorithm discussed in this paper uses sinlge wheel testing to predict the full vehicle performance in a skid steer turn. With this prediction algorithm, skid steering can be easily enhanced by iterating on the design of a <b>single</b> <b>wheel</b> without the cost of vehicle testing. To validate this algorithm and explore skid steering enhancement several <b>single</b> <b>wheel</b> skid steering experiments were done and the results were compared to a full vehicle's turning performance...|$|R

50|$|In Europe, {{super singles}} became popular when the allowed weight of {{semitrailer}} rigs was increased from 38 to 40 tonnes. In this reform the trailer industry replaced two 10 t axles with dual wheels, with three 8 t axles on wide-base <b>single</b> <b>wheels.</b> The significantly lower axle weight on super singles {{must be considered}} when comparing road wear from <b>single</b> versus dual <b>wheels.</b> The majority of super singles sold in Europe have a width of 385 mm. The standard 385 tires have a legal load limit of 4500 kg. (Note that expensive, specially reinforced 385 tires approved for 5000 kg do exist. Their market share is tiny, except for mounting on the steer axle.) A high share of research on road wear from heavy vehicles have failed to consider relevant axle load on super singles, as they compare road wear from 10-tonne axle load both dual <b>wheels</b> and on <b>single</b> <b>wheels,</b> instead of the relevant 8 - 9 t axle load on <b>single</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R

Results show {{that there are no}} significant decrements in strength of conductor with trapezoidal conductor when it is passing through different patterns of string pulley. It indicates that damages on conductor with trapezoidal conductor caused by both types of string pulley are similar. It is also found that average strength of conductor with circular conductor decreases 1. 60 % and 2. 99 % when conductor is passing through string pulley with <b>single</b> <b>wheel</b> and multi wheels over twenty times. It is concluded that strength damage on conductor with circular conductor induced by multi wheels is a little larger than that by <b>single</b> <b>wheel...</b>|$|R
