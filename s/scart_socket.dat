50|$|The {{most common}} {{adapters}} {{sold in the}} market only decode MPEG-2 and have only one SCART output socket. Old TV sets (before 1980) need a UHF modulator between the TV and the set-top box, as they have no <b>SCART</b> <b>socket.</b> Unlike VCRs, DVB-T set-top boxes rarely include such a modulator, and a SCART to RCA adaptor is often needed to feed the modulator with the signal. The solution recommended by France Télé Numérique is just {{to buy a new}} TV set instead of using a modulator.|$|E
50|$|The {{declared}} {{goal for}} this device was to convince non-computer-savvy people that computers are not impossibly hard {{to use and}} can be bought and used like normal home appliances. For this reason, it was intentionally designed to resemble a videocassette recorder more than a computer and it was equipped with two <b>SCART</b> <b>sockets</b> (to connect it to a TV set), a TV-like remote control and a slot that would host a satellite decoder card.|$|R
5000|$|SCART is {{bi-directional}} regarding standard composite {{video and}} analogue audio. A TV will typically send the antenna {{audio and video}} signals to the <b>SCART</b> <b>sockets</b> {{all the time and}} watch for returned signals, to display and reproduce them. This allows [...] "transparent" [...] set-top boxes, without any tuner, which just [...] "hook" [...] and pre-process the TV signals. This feature is used for analogue pay TV like Canal Plus and was used for decoding teletext.|$|R
50|$|Included in the {{packaging}} is a Top Up TV bespoke remote control and SCART lead, a signal improvement kit, an RF lead and a power cable. Printed materials include the Top Up TV welcome pack, {{a remote control}} codes guide and an instruction manual. The rear of the box has two <b>SCART</b> <b>sockets,</b> two tuners, an S-Video output, analogue phono output and Digital Audio output. It features a powered but functionless USB port on the front or rear of the DTR.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "down" [...] socket {{can also}} be used to connect other devices, such as DVD players or game consoles. As long as all devices have at least one [...] "up" [...] and [...] "down" [...] socket, this allows for {{connecting}} a virtually unlimited number of devices to a single <b>SCART</b> <b>socket</b> on the TV. While audio and video signals can travel both [...] "up" [...] to the TV and [...] "down" [...] to devices farther away from the TV, this is not true for RGB (and non-standard [...] ) signals, which can only travel towards the TV.|$|E
50|$|The Digibox's {{internal}} hardware {{details are}} not publicly disclosed, however some details are clearly {{visible on the}} system. All early boxes except the Pace Javelin feature dual SCART outputs, an RS232 serial port, a dual-output RF modulator with passthrough, and RCA socketed audio outputs, {{as well as a}} 33.6 modem and an LNB cable socket. A VideoGuard card slot, as well as a second smart-card reader are fitted to the front (these are for the Sky viewing card and other interactive cards). All share an identical user interface and EPG, with the exception of Sky+ HD boxes which use the new Sky+ HD Guide. All Sky and early HD boxes had a s-video output socket. The latest DRX595 has dropped the RF modulator outputs. A PC type interface was fitted internally to some early standard boxes but was never utilised by Sky. The latest HD boxes only have a single <b>scart</b> <b>socket</b> but have a RCA/phono socket for composite video output. All Sky+ and HD boxes have an optical sound output.|$|E
5000|$|A VCR {{will often}} have two <b>SCART</b> <b>sockets,</b> to connect {{it to the}} TV ("up", [...] "primary" [...] or [...] "1"), and for video input from a set-top box or other device ("down", [...] "secondary" [...] or [...] "2"). When idle or powered off, VCRs will usually forward the signals from the TV to the set-top decoder and send the {{processed}} result back to the TV. When a scrambled show is recorded, the VCR will drive the set-top box from its own tuner and send the unscrambled signals to the TV for viewing or simple recording control. Alternatively, the VCR could use the signals from the TV, in which case it would be inadvisable to change channels on the TV during the recording.|$|R
50|$|Nearly {{all modern}} DVD players and set-top boxes with <b>SCART</b> <b>sockets</b> can output RGB signal, which offers {{superior}} picture quality to composite signal. However, many devices {{do not have}} RGB output turned on by default, instead defaulting to composite video — RGB often has {{to be set up}} manually in the menu or via switches {{on the back of the}} device.The Nintendo GameCube, Wii, Neo-Geo, Dreamcast, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox and Xbox 360 can output RGB, component video, S-Video, or composite video. These consoles come with the standard composite video connector, but the manufacturers and third parties sell connectors for component video hookup and for RGB SCART hookup. Where the Nintendo GameCube and Xbox automatically switch to the proper mode, the PlayStation 2 must be told via a selection in the system menu whether it is to use YPBPR or RGB video.|$|R
50|$|The first {{products}} invented were video adapters/RF modulators to {{let people}} connect a Game console to the aerial input of their TV set. This was {{before the advent of}} <b>SCART</b> <b>sockets</b> on TVs. Then came adapters (the REP range) for the Canal+ Decoder which arrived in 1983. After that there were colour transcoders PAL-SECAM and SECAM-PAL, a balanced line video transmission system for the home (the Visiline), and then the wireless video transmitters (Freeline) and remote control relays (Zapline). There were all sorts of RF video modulators (Moduline) too. For the last six years the main product has been the Premio, and now Etimo range of Set-top box or Digital TV adapters, since by the end of 2011 France has finished changing entirely to Digital TV. In 2010 CGV added to its product line two HD Digital Sat receivers Set-top box, (Premio Sat HD-W TNTSAT) and (E-Sat HD-W FRANSAT) with recording of Satellite television channels on an external USB hard drive, and Powerline communication systems named (CPLine 2B), (CPline WiFi) and (CPLine AV-HD).|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Non-RGB SCART male {{connector}}. Only 10 pins (2, 6, 7, 8, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20) are available. Some cheap cables or devices (DVD players, TVs) have a 21-pin <b>SCART</b> connector or <b>socket</b> {{that actually}} have 10 wires connected {{and are thus}} not RGB / S-Video capable, but only CVBS.|$|R
