The citrus family was represented by orange trees (larinġ), lemon trees (lumi), tangerine <b>trees</b> (mandolin), and <b>sweet</b> <b>lime</b> <b>trees</b> (lumiċell).

50|$|The <b>lime</b> <b>tree</b> is {{protected}} from storms by the vicarage and the church, which stand approximately 15 metres apart. The crown spans {{a large part}} of the churchyard. A memorial to the fallen soldiers of both World Wars is situated close to the tree. The ground around the <b>lime</b> <b>tree</b> is not sealed, but partly grassed over. A few metres away stands another <b>lime</b> <b>tree,</b> which, according to the parish register, was planted in 1622.

5000|$|Despite {{enlargement}} of the churchyard in 1737, the continual shortage of space meant {{that some of the}} graves had to be placed close to the <b>lime</b> <b>tree.</b> Thus they were within the rooted area of the tree, which is typically very extensive with <b>lime</b> <b>trees.</b> In 1839 Saxonia magazine stated that the <b>lime</b> <b>tree</b> [...] "probably nourished itself from the surrounding corpses". The advancing age and the increasing girth of the <b>lime</b> <b>tree</b> meant that it became more and more well-known. The girth of 21 ells (11.9 metres) made it a remarkable feature. Hence, the Duke of Courland, who was the third son of Friedrich August II and the grandchild of August the Strong, had the <b>lime</b> <b>tree</b> geometrically recorded in around 1750.|$|R

5000|$|The journal Saxony's Church Gallery (Sachsens Kirchen-Galerie) from 1836 {{contains}} {{references to}} the size of the trunk and compares it to other lime trees: [...] "There is a <b>lime</b> <b>tree</b> in the churchyard of Kaditz, which is remarkable due to its circumference and great age. The circumference of the trunk of the well-known <b>lime</b> <b>tree</b> near Augustusburg measures 18 1/2 ells. A <b>lime</b> <b>tree</b> in Swabia with a girth of 18 ells is listed as the oldest and strongest in Germany. The one in the churchyard of Kaditz measures 19 3/4 ells at the root. The ancient tree is hollow, and the diameter of its cavity totals 5 ells." [...] 19 An article in Saxonia, a journal from 1839, bearing the title [...] "The Great <b>Lime</b> <b>Tree</b> in the Churchyard of Kaditz Near Dresden" [...] ("Die große Linde auf dem Kirchhofe zu Kaditz bei Dresden"), also compares the Kaditz lime to that at Augustusburg: [...] "In that churchyard, opposite the main gate and between the church and the parsonage, stands the <b>lime</b> <b>tree,</b> which is conspicuous for its size and age. The Kaditz <b>lime</b> <b>tree,</b> measuring 21 ells at its maximum girth, surpasses the Augustusburg <b>lime</b> <b>tree</b> with a girth of 18 1/2 ells."

50|$|In 1637, {{when the}} Thirty Years' War was raging in Saxony, {{the church was}} in flames again. Miraculously, the <b>lime</b> <b>tree</b> {{remained}} almost unscathed. The church remained a burnt-out ruin for years after the fire until restoration began in 1650. Remains of the Lawrence chapel form part of today's steeple. During the Thirty Years' War, Swedish troops camped under the <b>lime</b> <b>tree.</b> In 1686 the parsonage was built next to the church {{with the result that}} the <b>lime</b> <b>tree</b> was now situated between the two buildings.|$|R
5000|$|That same year, a great fire {{occurred}} in Kaditz - this time {{mainly in the}} west of the town. The fire destroyed 19 farmhouses, 30 barns and the rectory, which was located a few metres from the <b>lime</b> <b>tree.</b> The fire leapt from the parsonage onto the big <b>lime</b> <b>tree</b> and destroyed one half of the trunk, which burned down to the core. However, the <b>lime</b> <b>tree</b> prevented the fire from spreading from the parsonage onto the church and, despite significant damage, the <b>lime</b> <b>tree</b> survived. Because of the damage, a large cavity facing the rectory opened up in the trunk, which had been hollow, but fully closed up until then. Thus the <b>lime</b> <b>tree</b> decomposed slowly from the inside. The cavity inside the trunk was so big {{that it was possible to}} set up tables and chairs inside. [...] On many occasions, young people would gather there to play music. [...] Over a period of decades the tree’s roots developed further, forming secondary trunks to strengthen the remains of the main trunk and to increase the tree’s stability. Because of this phenomenon, the <b>lime</b> <b>tree</b> was often the object of excursions for teachers and students in the field of dendrology, the science of trees and wooded plants. [...] The tree’s fame increased even more after the fire and the development of its abnormal growth. [...] Many drawings and pictures of the <b>lime</b> <b>tree</b> have emerged, one of which was displayed at an art exhibition in Dresden, which contributed to its growing popularity. One could read about the tree's fate in journals and magazines, in which the authors spared no superlatives describing the age and fortune of the Kaditz <b>lime</b> <b>tree.</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effect of salinity on concentration of potassium (K), sodium (Na) and chloride (Cl) ions, in <b>sweet</b> <b>lime</b> budded on five citrus rootstocks, including Bakraii (mandarin x <b>sweet</b> <b>lime),</b> Volcameriana, Sour orange, <b>Sweet</b> <b>lime</b> and Mexican lime in a glasshouse, using a randomized completely design with factorial arrangement and four replications. Rootstocks had great effect on the concentration of ions in scion. Concentration and distribution of ions were significantly different in control and other treatments. Salinity increased Na and Cl ions in shoots and roots, but the rate of increase varied among rootstocks and treatments. Lowest concentration of Na and Cl ions were in shoot of scion on Volkameriana. Under salinity stress, K concentration increased in shoots of scion on Sour orange and Bakraei and decreased it on other rootstocks. Salinity increased K concentration in roots of all rootstocks except for Mexican lime...|$|R
25|$|The Heuvel, {{one of the}} {{important}} squares, had its own <b>lime</b> <b>tree</b> until 27 April 1994, being chopped for a bicycle parking basement.

5000|$|In 2008, {{a branch}} of the smaller part of the trunk {{was on the verge of}} {{breaking}} off with the upper part of the bark, so it had to be supported by a metal strut. During the flood of the century in 2002 Kaditz was completely enclosed by water; the lower districts were flooded. The flood water flowed over the high cemetery wall and submerged the graves in the cemetery. The water stopped at the highest point of the area, on the threshold of the church and just in front of the <b>lime</b> <b>tree's</b> main trunk. In 2003, the new sign and a new information board were placed next to the old natural monument with the owl. In recent times too there have been regular reports about the <b>lime</b> <b>tree</b> in both newspapers and books. The silviculturist and conservationist Hans Joachim Fröhlich, initiator of the Association of Old Adorable Trees in Germany (Alte liebenswerte Bäume in Deutschland e. V.), wrote in 2000: [...] "The <b>lime</b> <b>tree</b> is a monumental tree with many feet, arms and bodies."

[...] "Kaditz <b>lime</b> <b>tree</b> - Older than the city.
