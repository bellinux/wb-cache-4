Communicating the bitstream {{has to be done}} in a secure manner to prevent an attacker from reading or altering the bitstream. We propose a setup in which the FPGA is the single device in the system’s zone-of-trust. The result is an FPGA architecture that is divided into a static and a dynamic region. The static region holds the communication, <b>security</b> <b>and</b> <b>reconfiguration</b> facilities, while the dynamic region contains the targeted application...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a knowledge-based approach to cortical surface segmentation that uses learned {{knowledge of the}} overall shape and range of variation of the cortex (excluding the detailed gyri and sulci) to guide {{the search for the}} grey-CSF boundary in a structural MRI image volume. The shape knowledge is represented by a radial surface model, which is a type of geometric constraint network (GCN) that we hypothesize can represent shape by networks of locally interacting constraints. The shape model is used in a protocol for visualization-based mapping of cortical stimulation mapping (CSM) sites onto the brain surface, prior to integration with other mapping modalities or as input to existing surface analysis <b>and</b> <b>reconfiguration</b> <b>programs.</b> Example results are presented for CSM data related to language organization in the cortex, but the methods should be applicable to other situations where a realistic visualization of the brain surface, as seen at neurosurgery, is desired. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA) 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores {{trade-offs}} between knowledge {{exploitation and}} exploration activities. The study of exploitation and exploration activities is not new; however, rarely has past research perceived exploitation and exploration activities as two edges of one continuum. Furthermore, little {{evidence has been}} reported as to the actual trade-offs that firms face when launching either exploration or exploitation activities. This paper sets about filling this gap by addressing the following question: To what extent does an investment in one exploitation activity hinder {{the development of an}} exploration activity within the firm? A new process innovation targeting the exploitation of the firm's internal capabilities through an extensive component reuse <b>and</b> <b>reconfiguration</b> <b>program</b> is studied <b>and</b> the implications for inter-related exploration activities, such as the development of engineers' expertise is examined. To reveal the trade-offs between exploration and exploitation activities, both changes within and between these exploitation and exploration activities, over time, are studied. Based on data drawn from an in-depth study of several product development project teams in one high-tech company, we conclude that by investing in exploitation activities, a firm may limit some specific exploration activities...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} has recognised {{the potential of}} coupling ADLs with underlying runtime environments to support systematic and integrated "specification-to-deployment" architectures. However, while some promising results have been obtained, much of this {{research has}} not considered the crucial issue of causally-connected dynamic <b>reconfiguration</b> <b>and</b> has considered only domain-specific areas. In this {{paper we discuss a}} specification-to-deployment architecture called Plastik that employs an extended general-purpose ADL and is underpinned by an efficient runtime that is suited both for high-level application development and low-level systems development (e. g. embedded systems). Runtime reconfiguration is supported both at the ADL level and at the runtime level, <b>and</b> both <b>programmed</b> <b>reconfiguration</b> <b>and</b> adhoc <b>reconfiguration</b> are supported. The paper focuses on the mapping of ADL-level specifications to runtime instantiations and on the necessary runtime support for causally-connected dynamic reconfiguration...|$|R

The conventional approach to partially or fully reconfigure the device to meet different requirements results in an associated delay and/or overprovision of resources required.

40|$|There is an {{unprecedented}} {{need to preserve}} and restore aquatic and riparian biological diversity before extinction eliminates the opportunity. Ecological restoration is the reestablishment of processes, functions, and related biological, chemical, and physical linkages between the aquatic and associated riparian ecosystems; it is the repairing of damage caused by human activities. The first and most critical step in ecological restoration is passive restoration, the cessation of those anthropogenic activities that are causing degradation or preventing recovery. Given the capacity of riparian ecosystems to naturally recover, often this {{is all that is}} needed to achieve successful restoration. Prior to implementation of active restoration approaches (e. g., instream structures, channel <b>and</b> streambank <b>reconfiguration,</b> <b>and</b> planting <b>programs),</b> a period of time sufficient for natural recovery is recommended.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a concept for the <b>reconfiguration</b> <b>and</b> <b>programming</b> of a robot system for different application types by a non-expert end-user. To achieve this, {{it is necessary}} to exchange components on demand {{and at the same time}} reuse available process definitions, offer a high-level programming interface for the end-user and generate executable code for the involved components automatically. The presented concept is based on component, process and application descriptions realized as semantically annotated state charts. Matching of process and component descriptions determines executable processes. Fusion of process, component and application description results in executable code. The concept is intended to provide a basis for the realization of robot assistants for small series production where a robot system must be a flexible to use and easy to program tool that supports workers in their daily business...|$|R

40|$|Virtualization {{techniques}} {{are applied to}} improve features like isolation, <b>security,</b> mobility <b>and</b> dynamic <b>reconfiguration</b> in distributed systems. To introduce these advantages into the network where they are highly required, an interesting approach is to virtualize the internet routers themselves. This technique could enable several virtual networks of different types, owners and protocols to coexist inside one physical network. In this study, we propose {{a model of a}} virtual router we have implemented with XEN and we evaluate its properties. We show that the performance is close to the performance of non virtualized software routers, but causes an important processing overhead and unfairness in the share of the resources. We study the impact of the virtual machine scheduler parameters on the network performance and we show that the module which is responsible of forwarding the packets between the virtual machines and the physical interfaces is the critical point of network communications...|$|R

Major expansion of the airline terminal - which had already been expanded at least twice - took place throughout 2010 and 2011. The expanded terminal opened to the public on October 2, 2011.
