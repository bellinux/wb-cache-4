40|$|Fatigue {{tests at}} zero mean load {{have been carried}} out on copper and {{nickel-chromium}} alloy steel plate specimens containing two small coplanar edge cracks. For a wide range of crack lengths it was found that whether or not a crack grew depended on the value of u 31, where u is the <b>semi-range</b> of the alternating stress and I is the edge-crack length. If u 31 is greater than C a crack will grow, if US is less than C a crack will remain dormant. C had a value of 0. 6 for copper and of 5. 5 for the alloy steel when u was in ton/in 2 and I in inches...|$|E
40|$|The {{requirement}} for optimal nutrient concentrations is important {{both within the}} intestinal tract and at the cellular level. Nutrient requirements are sometimes expressed as the mean requirements for various classes of animals so that nutritionists sometimes include a margin of safety during times of stressful conditions. However, {{we need to keep}} in mind that life is a dynamic, complex process and consequently basic nutrient requirements are constantly shifting, especially within a growing animal or a female that is reproducing (Henry and Miles, 2000). Aim of this research was to evaluate, in trotting mares (during the last 3 months of pregnancy) and their foals (for their first 8 months of life), the effects of an oral supplementation (50 g/d) with a nutraceutical product (Horse Care, Deavit ®) on serum osteocalcin concentration and on some serum mineral contents (Zn, Cu, P, Ca, and Mg), and alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP), both biomarkers of skeletal metabolism. These animals received only pasture and oats, living in a <b>semi-range</b> condition...|$|E
30|$|The {{problem of}} PU {{localization}} in CR networks has attracted some attention {{over the past}} few years. For example, in [8], a Bayesian approach based on range and phase measurements is proposed, while a <b>semi-range</b> method is introduced in [9]. However, range-based approaches are difficult to apply in practice because the transmission power of PUs is typically unknown as well as the propagation channel between PUs and SUs. In addition, theoretical bounds and approximate maximum-likelihood algorithms based on received signal strength measurements were derived in [10], showing that the achievable estimation accuracy is relatively poor if all PU transmission parameters are unknown and SUs can rely only on energy measurements. Therefore, different approaches need to be explored for application in CR networks. Time-difference-of-arrival (TDoA) techniques could be adopted in principle, but they require perfect synchronization among different SU receivers, which is not always possible in CR systems. A weighted centroid approach was proposed in [11], which is suitable for dense CR networks with many sensors close to the PU position.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{presence}} or absence of vasectomized male buffaloes on the reproductive efficiency of buffalo cows (n = 396) undergoing artificial insemination (AI) was studied on six farms owned and operated by a single consortium. Lactating animals were separated into two groups of various sizes on each farm and kept under <b>semi-range</b> conditions. Vasectomized bulls were present in one group at a bull/empty-cow ratio of 1 : 30. No bulls were present in the other group. Reproductive efficiency between the two groups over a period of 3. 5 months was compared and evaluated on the basis of: 1) the number of spontaneous overt estruses associated with either feeble or intense signs of estrous behaviour; 2) the number of functional estrous cycles, i. e. estrous cycles with luteal phases defined as normal, based on specified progesterone concentrations in milk or blood plasma 8 - 10 days after estrus; 3) the number of consecutive functional estrous cycles in cases of induced estrus; and 4) pregnancy rate. Groups with bulls present demonstrated a significantly higher reproductive efficiency than groups without them. There was a higher incidence of spontaneous estrus (92 versus 69...|$|E
40|$|Tidal {{conditions}} fail {{to explain}} a paradoxical similarity in water level extremes induced by Hurricane Isabel on 18 September 2003, and the 23 August 1933 storm of record at Hampton Roads, Virginia. Storm surge peaks occurred near astronomical high tide during both storms, but Isabel arrived during neap tides while tides during the 1933 storm were nearer to spring. In addition, Isabel produced a lesser storm surge, yet she yielded a storm tide, or high-water mark, roughly {{equal to that of}} the 1933 hurricane. The answer to the paradox lies in observed sea level—water level measured relative to the land—and its movement during the 70 years between these events. Water level analysis shows that the sea level change observed can be divided into three categories at three different time scales: daily (astronomical tides), monthly (seasonal change), and yearly (secular trend in sea level). At Hampton Roads, a secular rise rate of 4. 25 mm⋅yr- 1 (1. 39 ft/century) predicted an increase of 29. 8 cm in 70 years; mean sea level for the month of September stood an additional 21. 9 cm above the annual mean for 2003. These numbers are comparable to the mean <b>semi-range</b> of tide (37. 0 cm) at Hampton Roads. Thus seasonal and secular change are both factors of key importance in evaluating storm tide risk at time scales attributable to major hurricanes (100 years). Adoption of a new vertical reference, projected monthly mean sea level, is proposed to facilitate their inclusion in storm tide predictions at decadal time scales...|$|E
40|$|Hurricane Isabel made {{landfall}} on September 18, 2003, {{preceded by}} threats of severe coastal flooding in North Carolina, Virginia and Maryland. As a Category 2 hurricane, Isabel {{could be expected}} to generate a storm surge of between 1. 8 and 2. 4 m (6 - 8 ft) according to the Saffir-Simpson scale. Instead, the storm produced a lesser surge of approximately 1. 45 m (4. 8 ft) at Hampton Roads, VA, in lower Chesapeake Bay. However, storm tide high water marks left by Isabel in the lower bay area equaled those of a Category 3 hurricane that produced a surge of about 1. 78 m (5. 8 ft) on August 23, 1933. Tidal conditions fail to explain the paradox: storm surge peaks occurred near astronomical high tide during both storms but Isabel arrived during neap tides while tides during the 1933 storm were nearer to spring. The answer lies in observed sea level – water level measured relative to the land – and its movement during the 70 years between these events.

At Hampton Roads, a secular rise rate of 4. 25 mm/yr (1. 39 ft/century) predicted an increase of 29. 8 cm in 70 years time and mean sea level for the month of September stood an additional 21. 9 cm above the annual mean for 2003.
