5|$|Dominica's {{terrain is}} rugged, which has fostered {{distinct}} regional traditions. The northern, eastern, southern, western and central {{parts of the}} island are music areas. The villages of Wesley and Marigot are also unique in their preservation of English language and music rather than the more French-based <b>styles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rest of the island.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally, most war {{memorials}} {{were relatively}} conservative in design, aiming to use established styles {{to produce a}} tragic but comforting, noble and enduring commemoration of the war dead. Classical themes were particularly common, taking the prevailing <b>styles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> late 19th century and typically simplifying them to produce cleaner, more abstract memorials. Allegorical and symbolic features, frequently drawing on Christian imagery, were used to communicate themes of self-sacrifice, victory and death. Some memorials adopted a medievalist theme instead, looking backwards to a more secure past, while others used emerging realist and Art Deco architectural styles to communicate the themes of the war.|$|E
5|$|Before and After Science is {{the fifth}} studio album by British {{musician}} Brian Eno. Produced by Eno and Rhett Davies, it was originally released by Polydor Records in December 1977 in the UK and by US Island soon after. Guest musicians from the United Kingdom and Germany helped with the album, including members of Roxy Music, Free, Fairport Convention, Can and Cluster. Over one hundred tracks were written with only ten making the album's final cut. The musical <b>styles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album range from energetic and jagged to more languid and pastoral.|$|E

5|$|Buena Vista Social Club is an {{ensemble}} of Cuban musicians established in 1996 {{to revive the}} music of pre-revolutionary Cuba. The project was organized by World Circuit executive Nick Gold, produced by American guitarist Ry Cooder and directed by Juan de Marcos González. They named the group after the homonymous members' club in the Buenavista quarter of Havana, a popular music venue in the 1940s. To showcase the popular <b>styles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time, such as son, bolero and danzón, they recruited a dozen veteran musicians, many {{of which had been}} retired for years.|$|E
5|$|Burch's {{style has}} been {{described}} as preppy-boho and preppy-bohemian luxe, and is associated with her T-logo medallion. Known for being easy to wear and versatile, her styles are popular with women of all ages, including the viewers and fans of the television show Gossip Girl, where they were often featured. In 2007, there were wait lists to buy Tory Burch fashions, which are known for color and print and often pay homage to <b>styles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1960s and 1970s. Burch named her line of Reva ballerina flats after her mother.|$|E
5|$|In Nuskhuri manuscripts, Asomtavruli {{are used}} for titles and {{illuminated}} capitals. The latter were used at the beginnings of paragraphs which started new sections of text. In {{the early stages of}} the development of Nuskhuri texts, Asomtavruli letters were not elaborate and were distinguished principally by size and sometimes by being written in cinnabar ink. Later, from the 10th century, the letters were illuminated. The style of Asomtavruli capitals can be used to identify the era of a text. For example, in the Georgian manuscripts of the Byzantine era, when the <b>styles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine Empire influenced Kingdom of Georgia, capitals were illuminated with images of birds and other animals.|$|E

5|$|In {{conformation}} showing, eyes {{should be}} brown in colour; yellow eyes do sometimes occur but are penalised {{in the show}} ring. Ears are small, pendulous (suspended and hanging), vine-shaped and with a light setter-like feathering. Nostrils are well developed and are black or any shade of brown; a pink nose is penalised in the AKC standard for the show ring, in Britain the colour is not specified in The Kennel Club's breed standard. In showing, a scissors bite is preferred with an undershot jaw severely penalised. Unlike the English Springer Spaniel and English Cocker Spaniel, there is no divergence into show and field <b>styles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breed.|$|E
5|$|Mansfield's {{wardrobe}} {{relied on}} the shapeless <b>styles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1960s to hide her weight gain {{after the birth of}} her fifth child. Despite career setbacks, Mansfield remained a highly visible celebrity during the early 1960s, through her publicity antics and stage performances. In early 1967, Mansfield filmed her last film role: a cameo in A Guide for the Married Man, a comedy starring Walter Matthau, Robert Morse, and Inger Stevens. Mansfield is listed as one of the technical advisers, along with other popular stars in the opening credits.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{buildings}} on Mackinac Island are built of wood, a few are of stone, and most have clapboard siding. The architectural styles on the island span 300 years, from the earliest Native American structures to the <b>styles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th century. The earliest structures were built by the Anishinaabe and Ojibwe (Chippewa) tribes before European exploration. At least two buildings still exist from the original French settlement in the late 18th century. Mackinac Island has the only example of northern French rustic architecture in the United States, and one of few survivors in North America.|$|E

5|$|Much {{of modern}} popular music can trace its roots to the {{emergence}} in the late 19th century of African American blues {{and the growth of}} gospel music in the 1920s. The African American basis for popular music used elements derived from European and indigenous musics. There are also strong African roots in the music tradition of the original white settlers, such as country and bluegrass. The United States has also seen documented folk music and recorded popular music produced in the ethnic <b>styles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ukrainian, Irish, Scottish, Polish, Hispanic, and Jewish communities, among others.|$|E
5|$|Previous IWGP Heavyweight Champion A.J. <b>Styles</b> (<b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bullet Club group) {{and fellow}} top {{contender}} Tetsuya Naito were slated to wrestle {{each other at}} Wrestle Kingdom 9. During the 2014 G1 Climax (when Styles was IWGP Heavyweight Champion), Naito pinned him in a non-title tournament match but {{did not have a}} title shot before Styles lost to Tanahashi. Since Styles did not receive a rematch with Tanahashi, it was theorized by the American media that the Wrestle Kingdom 9 winner would be the top contender.|$|E
5|$|Sony Entertainment {{originally}} conceived The Spectacular Spider-Man as {{a series}} of four DVDs, and asked Weisman and Cook to develop it. The central idea was to follow Spider-Man in his younger years in the comics; Weisman and Cook wanted to incorporate the <b>styles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early comic publications by Lee and Ditko. Reviewers have cited other influences in the themes, such as the live action film series and the Ultimate Spider-Man continuity.|$|E

5|$|The band {{gradually}} rebuilt {{their musical}} and songwriting confidence during these rehearsals {{during the summer}} of 1979, with the <b>styles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> session's early cover songs setting the template for the diverse material that would be written for London Calling. The band were also encouraged by a growing appreciation of drummer Topper Headon's drumming skills, which they realised could be used to perform music in a wide array of genres and styles beyond punk rock. The Clash wrote and recorded demos, with Mick Jones composing and arranging much of the music and Joe Strummer generally writing the lyrics.|$|E
5|$|Hanging scroll: Hanging scrolls {{originated}} in their earliest form from literature and other texts written on bamboo strips and silk banners in ancient China. The earliest hanging scrolls {{are related to}} and developed from silk banners in early Chinese history. These banners were long and hung vertically on walls. Such silk banners and hanging scroll paintings were found at Mawangdui {{dating back to the}} Han Dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE). By the time of the Tang Dynasty (618–907), the aesthetic and structural objectives for hanging scrolls were summarized, which are still followed to this day. During the early Song Dynasty (960–1279), the scrolls became well suited to the art <b>styles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artists, consequently hanging scrolls were made in many different sizes and proportions.|$|E
5|$|Mario & Sonic brings {{together}} the two title characters and fourteen more from both franchises {{to participate in}} environments based on the official venues of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. These environments are stylized to fit the futuristic and cartoon-like art <b>styles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sonic and Mario franchises respectively. Each playable character {{has his or her}} own statistics which can serve as an advantage or disadvantage depending on the event. The characters are divided into four categories: all-around, speed, power, and skill. The Wii version has additional in-game characters taken from the console's Mii Channel, which allows the user to create a Mii, a customized avatar, that can be imported into games that support the feature. Both games have non-playable characters who serve as referees for particular events.|$|E

5|$|Renaissance is {{a concept}} {{formulated}} by cultural historian Jacob Burckhardt {{in the mid-nineteenth century}} to describe the intellectual and artistic movement that began in Italy in the fourteenth century and saw an attempt to revive the principles of the Greek and Roman classical worlds. It encompassed a rational and sceptical attitude, a return to ideas of original sources and proportion and balance in art. The major ideas of the Renaissance are generally considered to have reached Northern Europe much later, in the late fifteenth century. Scotland has been seen as part of a wider Northern Renaissance that is generally considered to have stretched into the early seventeenth century, when it was replaced by the grander <b>styles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Baroque. However, the association of Baroque styles with Catholicism in predominantly Protestant Scotland tended to result in this trend being overlooked and the period from about 1620 {{to the end of the}} seventeenth century is sometimes characterised as a late Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} {{parts of}} the castle continued {{to be used as}} a manor house into the 14th century. By the 18th century, however, Dolbadarn Castle was ruined and uninhabited. From the 1760s onwards, however, it became a popular topic for painters interested in the then fashionable landscape <b>styles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sublime and the Picturesque. Typically the castle was painted in the middle ground, allowing the viewer's eye to contrast its ruined outline with the lakes and mountains of Snowdonia; frequently the landscape was misrepresented by the artist, to create a more striking or dramatic effect. J. M. W. Turner's 1800 work Dolbadarn Castle depicted the back-lit castle looming over the landscape and became particularly famous, but the paintings of the castle by Richard Wilson and Paul Sandby also represent important artistic works of the period.|$|E
5|$|The {{kingdom of}} Dál Riata {{has been seen}} as a cross-roads between the artistic <b>styles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Picts and those of Ireland, with which the Scots {{settlers}} in what is now Argyll kept close contacts. This can be seen in representations found in excavations of the fortress of Dunadd, which combine Pictish and Irish elements. This included extensive evidence for the production of high status jewellery and moulds from the 7th century that indicate the production of pieces similar to the Hunterston brooch, found in Ayrshire, but with elements that suggest Irish origins. These and other finds, including a trumpet spiral decorated hanging bowl disc and a stamped animal decoration (or pressblech), perhaps from a bucket or drinking horn, indicate the ways in which Dál Riata was one of the locations where the Insular style was developed. In the 8th and 9th centuries the Pictish elite adopted true penannular brooches with lobed terminals from Ireland. Some older Irish pseudo-penannular brooches were adapted to the Pictish style, for example the Breadalbane Brooch (British Museum). The 8th century Monymusk Reliquary has elements of Pictish and Irish style.|$|E
