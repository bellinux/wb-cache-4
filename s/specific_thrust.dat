2500|$|The International Chiropractor's Association (ICA) {{states that}} the [...] "chiropractic spinal {{adjustment}} is unique and singular to the chiropractic profession", and that it [...] "is characterized by a <b>specific</b> <b>thrust</b> applied to the vertebra utilizing parts of the vertebra and contiguous structures as levers to directionally correct articular malposition. Adjustment shall be differentiated from spinal manipulation in that the adjustment can only be applied to a vertebral malposition with the express intent to improve or correct the subluxation, whereas any joint, subluxated or not, may be manipulated to mobilize the joint or to put the joint through its range of motion... Chiropractic is a specialized field in the healing arts, and by prior rights, the spinal adjustment is distinct and singular to the chiropractic profession." [...] One author claims that this concept is now repudiated by mainstream chiropractic. The definition of this procedure describes {{the use of a}} load (force) to specific body tissues with therapeutic intent. [...] This ‘load’ is traditionally supplied by hand, and can vary in its velocity, amplitude, duration, frequency, and body location (p.218) and is usually abbreviated HVLA (high velocity low amplitude) thrust.|$|E
50|$|A modern civil {{turbofan}} {{has a low}} <b>specific</b> <b>thrust</b> (~30 lbf/(lb/s)) to {{keep the}} jet noise at an acceptable level, and to achieve low fuel consumption, because a low <b>specific</b> <b>thrust</b> helps to improve specific fuel consumption (SFC). This low <b>specific</b> <b>thrust</b> is usually achieved with a high bypass ratio. Additionally a low <b>specific</b> <b>thrust</b> implies that the engine is relatively large in diameter, for the net thrust it produces. Consequently such aircraft engines are normally located externally, in a separate nacelle or pod, attached to the wing, or the rear fuselage.|$|E
50|$|A low (dry) <b>specific</b> <b>thrust</b> engine {{has a low}} {{tailpipe}} temperature, {{which means}} that the temperature rise across the afterburner can be high, giving a good thrust boost in afterburning. Nevertheless, the afterburning <b>specific</b> <b>thrust</b> is still relatively low. The total fuel flow (main combustor plus afterburner) is fixed by the temperature rise from air intake to nozzle and, for a given airflow, changes little with dry <b>specific</b> <b>thrust.</b> Consequently, the low afterburning thrust implies a high afterburning SFC. However, the dry SFC is low.|$|E

50|$|Another {{application}} that {{could benefit from}} the VCE approach is combat aircraft. Designers normally {{have to make a}} compromise on <b>specific</b> <b>thrust</b> of the engine. If they choose a high <b>specific</b> <b>thrust,</b> the reheat specific fuel consumption (SFC) will be very good, but the dry SFC poor. A high <b>specific</b> <b>thrust</b> implies a high fan pressure ratio, which indicates a high nozzle temperature in dry power. Consequently, the thrust boost in reheat is relatively low. By definition, both the dry and reheat thrust levels are good.|$|E
50|$|By contrast, {{military}} turbofans often feature {{fairly high}} <b>specific</b> <b>thrust</b> (45-110 lbf/(lb/s)), which keeps the cross-sectional {{area of the}} engine low to more easily accommodate a narrow fuselage, which minimizes drag. A high <b>specific</b> <b>thrust</b> usually results in higher noise levels, which is not an important consideration for most military applications.|$|E
50|$|<b>Specific</b> <b>thrust</b> has {{significant}} bearing on thrust lapse rate: the low jet velocity {{associated with a}} low <b>specific</b> <b>thrust</b> engine implies that there are large reductions in net thrust with increasing flight velocity, {{which can only be}} partially offset by throttle changes at rated conditions (e.g. maximum recommended climb rating).|$|E

Tests include measurements of <b>thrust,</b> <b>specific</b> impulse, <b>thrust</b> vector, impulse bit repeatability, intermittency and endurance. The results show good impulse bit repeatability and a well defined thrust vector. The impulse bit, with a 1. 85 -joule input, was found to be approximately 26 micronewton-seconds at 190 seconds specific impulse.

50|$|Military turbofans, however, have a {{relatively}} high <b>specific</b> <b>thrust,</b> to maximize the thrust for a given frontal area, jet noise being of less concern in military uses relative to civil uses. Multistage fans are normally needed to reach the relatively high fan pressure ratio needed for high <b>specific</b> <b>thrust.</b> Although high turbine inlet temperatures are often employed, the bypass ratio tends to be low, usually significantly less than 2.0.|$|E

5000|$|Naturally, as {{altitude}} increases, {{there is}} a decrease in air density and, therefore, the net thrust of an engine. There is also a flight speed effect, termed thrust lapse rate. Consider the approximate equation for net thrust again:With a high <b>specific</b> <b>thrust</b> (e.g., fighter) engine, the jet velocity is relatively high, so intuitively one can see that increases in flight velocity have less of an impact upon net thrust than a medium <b>specific</b> <b>thrust</b> (e.g., trainer) engine, where the jet velocity is lower. The impact of thrust lapse rate upon a low <b>specific</b> <b>thrust</b> (e.g., civil) engine is even more severe. At high flight speeds, high-specific-thrust engines can pick up net thrust through the ram rise in the intake, but this effect tends to diminish at supersonic speeds because of shock wave losses.|$|E
5000|$|Thus civil turbofans {{today have}} a low exhaust speed (low <b>specific</b> <b>thrust</b> [...] - [...] net thrust divided by airflow) to keep jet noise to a minimum and to improve fuel efficiency. Consequently, the bypass ratio (bypass flow divided by core flow) is {{relatively}} high (ratios from 4:1 up to 8:1 are common), with the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB approaching 10:1. Only a single fan stage is required, because a low <b>specific</b> <b>thrust</b> implies a low fan pressure ratio.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{the main}} combustor, where the {{downstream}} turbine blades {{must not be}} damaged by high temperatures, an afterburner can operate at the ideal maximum (stoichiometric) temperature (i.e., about 2100K/3780Ra/3320F/1826C). At a fixed total applied fuel:air ratio, the total fuel flow for a given fan airflow will be the same, regardless of the dry <b>specific</b> <b>thrust</b> of the engine. However, a high <b>specific</b> <b>thrust</b> turbofan will, by definition, have a higher nozzle pressure ratio, resulting in a higher afterburning net thrust and, therefore, a lower afterburning specific fuel consumption (SFC). However, high <b>specific</b> <b>thrust</b> engines have a high dry SFC. The situation is reversed for a medium <b>specific</b> <b>thrust</b> afterburning turbofan: i.e., poor afterburning SFC/good dry SFC. The former engine is suitable for a combat aircraft which must remain in afterburning combat for a fairly long period, but has to fight only fairly close to the airfield (e.g. cross border skirmishes) The latter engine is better for an aircraft that has to fly some distance, or loiter for a long time, before going into combat. However, the pilot can afford to stay in afterburning only for a short period, before aircraft fuel reserves become dangerously low.|$|E
