40|$|This study aims to {{identify}} the types of imperative sentences on the medicine brochure andto describe the syntactic <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> imperative sentences on the medicine brochure. The type {{of this research is}} descriptive qualitative. The writer uses medicine brochures as the data source. The method of collecting data is documentation with the techniques of reading, identifying, and classifying the data. In analyzing the data, the writer identifies the types of imperative sentences using theory <b>of</b> grammatical <b>structure</b> from Quirk (1983) and describes the syntactic <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> imperative sentence using Chinese boxes from Francis (1958). The result of this study shows that (1) imperative sentence on the medicine brochure can be divided into two types: imperative sentence without a subject and negative imperative sentence, (2) there are six types <b>of</b> syntactic <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> imperative sentence in the medicine brochure: syntactic <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> modification, syntactic <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> modification + <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> predication, syntactic <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> complementation + <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> modification, syntactic <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> complementation + <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> coordination + <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> modification, syntactic <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> modification + <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> coordination, and syntactic <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> complementation + <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> coordination...|$|R
40|$|The basic aspect that is {{the subject}} of {{interest}} in this paper refers to the air traffic management. If it is true that the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> air transport makes a subsystem of air traffic also originating from the general theory of complex systems and the theory <b>of</b> modem management (<b>structuring),</b> then it appears from the theoretical and practical viewpoint possible and correct to decompose this subsystem in to a number of further subsystems of lower hierarchical level. Thus when dealing with the issue of air traffic management it is possible to discuss: the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> air traffic authorities, the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> air traffic as a system, the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> transport service, the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> passenger and freight services, internal <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> airlines, of airports, and <b>of</b> ATC, the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> individual business functions and the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> transport process. </p...|$|R

5|$|Crystal <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> {{proteins}} (which are irregular {{and hundreds}} of times larger than cholesterol) began to be solved in the late 1950s, beginning with the structure of sperm whale myoglobin by Sir John Cowdery Kendrew, for which he shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Max Perutz in 1962. Since that success, 132055 X-ray crystal <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules have been determined. For comparison, the nearest competing method in terms of structures analyzed is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which has resolved 11904 chemical structures. Moreover, crystallography can solve <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> arbitrarily large molecules, whereas solution-state NMR is restricted to relatively small ones (less than 70 kDa). X-ray crystallography is now used routinely by scientists to determine how a pharmaceutical drug interacts with its protein target and what changes might improve it. However, intrinsic membrane proteins remain challenging to crystallize because they require detergents or other means to solubilize them in isolation, and such detergents often interfere with crystallization. Such membrane proteins are a large component of the genome, and include many proteins of great physiological importance, such as ion channels and receptors. Helium cryogenics are used to prevent radiation damage in protein crystals.|$|E

40|$|Keywords: Syntactic structures, The Jakarta Post, Breaking News, {{sentence}} Nowadays English is {{the most}} popular language in the world. Many mass media publishing use English in reporting news or information to the reader or listener. Such news can be reported in the spoken language or written form. The Jakarta Post is one of media publishing that publish news and article in written form in English. Itâs not only publish news in paper edition but also electronic one which can be accessed online. One of the advantages accessing The Jakarta Post online is it provide a special feature which is updated every time namely Breaking News. By this feature, the reader can read the most actual information around the world which canât be found in paper edition. In order to be meaningful information, the reader have to understand its content. One of the way to understand such information, the reader need to know its sentence structure. Therefore, Syntax is a suitable study to discuss the sentence structure. Through this study, it will be easy to understand the use <b>of</b> syntactic <b>structures</b> in The Jakarta Post Breaking News. The formulation of research problems are: 1) what types <b>of</b> syntactic <b>structures</b> occur in The Jakarta Post breaking news sentences? 2) What componential variety forming syntactic structures in The Jakarta Post breaking news sentences? 3) How is the frequency of components forming each syntactic structure in The Jakarta Post breaking news sentences? While the objectives of this study are: 1) to find out the types <b>of</b> syntactic <b>structures</b> used in The Jakarta Post breaking news sentences. 2) To find out the componential variety forming syntactic structures in The Jakarta Post breaking news sentence, and 3) to find out the frequency of component forming each syntactic structure in The Jakarta Post breaking news sentences. The research design of this study is quantitative survey. The population and sample of this study are 170 sentences in The Jakarta Post Breaking News which were published on February 2014. Such data were gotten by accessing The Jakarta Post website under the address www. thejakartapost. com. The data collection method which was used is document note taking by using document as the instrument. The data was analyzed by using Chinese boxes and then analyzed the frequency by percentage. The result of data analysis, 1) there are four syntactic structures which constructed the topic sentence of The Jakarta Post Breaking News: <b>Structure</b> <b>of</b> predication, <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> modification, <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> complementation and <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> coordination. 2) The componential variety forming syntactic structure in The Jakarta Post sentences are:Simple Component: <b>Structure</b> <b>of</b> Predication (Single word as subject); <b>Structure</b> <b>of</b> Modification (verb as head, adverb as modifier, noun as modifier, and adjective as modifier); <b>Structure</b> <b>of</b> Complementation (verb as verbal element, adverb as complement, and single word as complement), Complex Component: <b>Structure</b> <b>of</b> Predication (noun phrase as subject, <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> coordination as subject, <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> modification as subject, verb phrase as predicate, <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> modification as predicate, and <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> complementation as predicate); <b>Structure</b> <b>of</b> Modification (verb phrase as head, prepositional phrase as modifier, <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> complementation as modifier, <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> modification as modifier, and <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> coordination as modifier); <b>Structure</b> <b>of</b> Complementation (verb phrase as verbal element, <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> modification as verbal element, <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> predication as complement, <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> modification as complement, and <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> coordination as complement); <b>Structure</b> <b>of</b> Coordination (<b>Structure</b> <b>of</b> predication). 3) The frequency of component forming each syntactic <b>structure</b> are: <b>Structure</b> <b>of</b> Predication (simple component occur 62 times with percentage 18. 2...|$|R
