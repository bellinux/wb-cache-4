5000|$|The United States {{established}} a consulate general in Dacca on 29 August 1949, following {{the partition of}} India and east Bengal becoming the eastern wing of the Dominion of Pakistan. American teachers, architects and aid workers frequented the capital of East Pakistan in the 1960s.During the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, American citizens led by the Consul General in Dacca, Archer K Blood, sent a series of telegrams detailing atrocities committed by the Pakistani military against Bengali civilians, students and intellectuals. They dissented with the Nixon administration’s policy of ignoring genocide due to the close American alliance with the Pakistani military junta. Within the US, public opinion also turned against Nixon for his policy on Bangladesh. Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers, including Ted Kennedy, Frank Church and William B. Saxbe, denounced the Nixon White House for its silence on the [...] "systematic oppression" [...] in East Pakistan. American cultural figures like the poet Allen Ginsberg (who wrote September on Jessore Road) and the singer Joan Baez promoted awareness of the Bangladesh War. The Concert for Bangladesh was organized in New York City by British, American and Indian musicians; and featured American icons like Bob Dylan. The U. S. Congress imposed an arms embargo on Pakistan; but despite that, the Nixon White House sent secret arms shipments to the junta. When India intervened in December 1971, the White House dispatched an aircraft carrier to the Bay on Bengal. Peace activists blocked arms shipments in several northeastern American ports. Bengali diplomats at the Pakistani embassy in Washington DC defected and operated a mission of the Provisional Government of Bangladesh. After the liberation of Bangladesh in December 1971 and the withdrawal of Indian troops in March 1972, the United States formally recognized the newly independent country on April 4, 1972 and pledged US$300 million in aid. Herbert D. Spivack was the principal American diplomatic officer in Dhaka at the time. Four days later, the United States and Bangladesh agreed to establish diplomatic relations at the embassy level. The consulate-general was officially upgraded to an embassy on 18 May 1972. Relations between Bangladesh and the American-led Western world dramatically improved in the late 1970s, when President Ziaur Rahman reversed the socialist policies of the first post-independence government and restored free markets. In 1983, military ruler Lieutenant General Hussain Muhammad Ershad was invited to the White House for talks with President Ronald Reagan. President Reagan praised Dhaka for {{its role in the}} Cold War, stating [...] "the United States wishes to applaud Bangladesh, a member of the nonaligned movement, for its constructive approach to issues of regional and global concern. To cite only a few examples: Bangladesh clearly manifested its courage and resolve in its unswerving responses to aggression in Afghanistan and Kampuchea. It also took the lead in establishing the <b>South</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>Regional</b> <b>Cooperation</b> Organization, a body designed to build a more prosperous and stable region for the people of South Asia. Bangladesh's foreign policy has exhibited an activism, moderation, and force of moral conviction which has earned the respect of the world".|$|E

Such a move was presumably {{prompted by the}} enthusiasm and calculation with which the <b>South</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>Regional</b> <b>Cooperation</b> (SARC) scheme was being given a formal shape following the proposal made by Ziaur Rahman, then President of Bangladesh. In 1985 the first South Asian summit accepted it, turning SARC into an association - South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation (SAARC). However, the two Himalayan kingdoms, Nepal and Bhutan were not new nations {{to the south of}} the Himalayas, as their civilisation links were more deep [...] ...|$|E
30|$|After {{protracted}} negotiations India and Bangladesh formally {{entered into}} {{an agreement on}} 5 November 1977 devising a formula for sharing dry season flow of water. The then President of Bangladesh Ziaur Rahman played the vital role in materialising the agreement. This agreement was completely bilateral in nature and it laid down that any differences in its interpretation would also be solved bilaterally. It was a landmark in the relations of the two neighbouring countries. This occurred when President Ziaur Rahman in Bangladesh was striving to provide stability and development to Bangladesh and fostered <b>South</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>Regional</b> <b>Cooperation</b> (SAARC). India was also striving to give new directions to foreign policy in terms of promoting friendly relations with all, especially with neighbours.|$|E

40|$|South Asian {{leaders have}} made it a {{priority}} to tackle key regional issues such as poverty, environment degradation, trade and investment barriers and food insecurity, among others. This book considers {{the leadership of the}} South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and the interaction with civil society in the process of <b>South</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> and integration, and discusses how the emerging urgency in the provision of regional public goods provides an excellent opportunity to add to the successes in South Asian regional integration. The book considers civil society’s role in regional and economic integration in South Asian industries, trade and services, and the importance of regional public goods such as food security for future integration efforts. It concludes that there are a few successes on which future cooperation and integration in South Asia can be built and where engagement with civil society could be productive, and that thes...|$|E
40|$|A central {{factor in}} the lack of <b>South</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> is the visceral {{animosity}} between India and Pakistan. The India-Pakistan security dilemma has prevented the region from exploiting a number of opportunities that regional cooperation could offer, including the benefits of economic growth, water/energy security and {{the social construction of}} intraregional goodwill through cultural interaction. These benefits could be employed by national governments to pursue development goals. It is incumbent upon India and Pakistan {{to pave the way for}} substantive regional cooperation by taking measures to encourage cross-border economic and social activities. There are a number of challenges in the India-Pakistan relationship that hinder regional cooperation. However economic integration, if decoupled from political disputes, provides a model through which the two states can develop mutually beneficial relations. In particular, three specific areas of cooperation between Pakistan and India should be pursued: increased levels of trade and the introduction of reforms that facilitate bilateral foreign direct investment; cooperation vis-à-vis water and energy resources; and the reduction of travel restrictions. These processes would constitute the first steps towards wider regional cooperation...|$|E
40|$|South Asian {{cooperation}} {{continues to}} stagnate, {{in contrast to}} other regions. In terms of economic cooperation, information flows, value systems and ideas of security the differences are more in evidence than the similarities, {{and it is the}} political gulf that needs to be bridged. The spirit of regional cooperation has to be developed through a conceptual vision of a new re-gion. But enlargement {{is not likely to be}} of help. The reconstruction of the South Asian state is the prime need of the region. Democracy has to be genuinely participatory; the intra-state regional balance is an essential component of this; and the structure and functions of govern-ment need to be addressed. South Asian states have to find a common roadmap leading to cooperation and friendship. For each state the legitimacy of power is the paramount guide in this regard. AFTER THE INITIAL euphoria, there is a functional catharsis in which South Asian cooperation continues to stagnate. The idea to reconceptualise <b>South</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> is important, although such a quest needs to cover the structure and em-bedded complexity of the region itself. The greatest example of regional cooperation in the world is the European Union (EU). But, ‘at present, the EU’s inner life is char...|$|E
