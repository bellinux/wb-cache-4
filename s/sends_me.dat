500|$|In a few {{accounts}} of Brannan's {{dealings with the}} LDS church {{it is said that}} Brigham Young sent the apostle Amasa Lyman to collect the tithing money that Brannan had withheld from the church's institution. When Lyman arrived Brannan was unable to account for the tithes that Brigham Young and other Mormons claimed were given to him or that he owed from his own personal income. He reportedly told them, [...] "You go back and tell Brigham Young that I'll give up the Lord's money when he <b>sends</b> <b>me</b> a receipt signed by the Lord", although historians, such as Will Bagley have found this is likely just legend. In another account, Lyman was sent to gather $10,000 of owed tithing from Brannan (or more if he was willing). After a couple of visits all of Brannan's debts to the Mormon church were considered to be paid in full.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "What Have You Done for Me Lately" [...] is {{described}} as an uptempo dance song. It begins with a conversation {{with one of her}} friends, who asks Jackson the title question. Lyrically, it involves the singer asking why her lover was not as attentive as he once was. He was not treating her as well as he used to, and she calls him a [...] "loser" [...] in response. [...] "I never ask for more than I deserve, you know it's the truth. You seem to think you're God's gift to this earth. I'm telling you no way", Jackson sings. Veda A. McCoy in the book Lifepower: Six Winning Strategies to a Life of Purpose, Passion & Power expressed that the song reminded that [...] "life is about more than just what you say. Life is also about what you do". Vibe noted that with [...] "What Have You Done for Me Lately", Jackson stands up for men. New York magazine's Chris Smith called the song's chorus [...] "fully belligerent". In a Billboard publication, Nelson George noted its [...] "tauting, tigerish" [...] beat. Ed Gonzalez from Slant Magazine commented, [...] "Nothing <b>sends</b> <b>me</b> into a trembling, corner-cowering stupor than a giggly, under-enunciated Janet Jackson jam." ...|$|E
2500|$|Flora Marian Spore's {{paintings}} were {{exhibited in the}} most conservative and prestigious art galleries of New York City: Knoedler's, Wildenstein's, Grand Central Art Galleries and also the Fine Arts Gallery of London, [...] "where art critics, society reporters, and psychiatrists, as well as crowds of the general public, flocked to see them." [...] She received much publicity from both the mainstream press and sensationalist tabloids, which printed such articles as [...] "Mystic voices led her to romance, fame and wealth" [...] and [...] "Pictures my mother <b>sends</b> <b>me</b> from beyond the grave." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor <b>send</b> <b>me</b> to a boarding-school," [...] pursued Betty. [...] "Mother's always {{threatening}} to <b>send</b> <b>me</b> to one.

2500|$|Rotten Tomatoes {{reports a}} 90% {{approval}} rating, based on 10 reviews. The critical consensus reads, [...] ""Nor'easter" [...] tightens {{the focus on}} plot, while maintaining its trademark campy, scary thrills." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B rating, stating, [...] ""Nor'easter" [...] is the weakest episode of the season so far, {{but it also has}} more than enough wacky shit going on to keep me entertained." [...] Amy Amatangelo of Paste gave it a 6.5 out 10 rating, stating, [...] "American Horror Story: Asylum is a completely wackadoodle series. This we know. But even when I accept this premise, the drama still <b>sends</b> <b>me</b> over the edge with its utter ridiculousness. Everything was completely over-the-top in [...] "Nor'easter"." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{book was}} {{translated}} from Korean into English by Deborah Smith, a British translator, {{who has been}} translating Korean into English since 2010. She {{is the founder of}} Tilted Axis Press, a non-profit publishing house focusing on contemporary fiction specifically from Asia. Speaking at the Seoul International Book Fair on 15 June 2016, Smith said that a translator [...] "must be unfaithful to some aspects in order to be faithful to others. I try to stay faithful to the spirit, and faithful to the letter as much as I can, without compromising the spirit." [...] Talking about the process, Kang said, [...] "Deborah usually <b>sends</b> <b>me</b> the file of her translation after she finishes, with notes and questions. And I send it back to her with my answers and notes. It is just like having a chat endlessly. I truly enjoy this process. I am lucky to have met Deborah, a wonderful translator who can render subtlety and delicacy." [...] Smith has said that her first attempt at Korean translation involved [...] "looking up practically every other word in the dictionary". Smith has translated some of Kang's other works, including Human Acts (2016) and The White Book (2017).|$|E
