40|$|The PIUS {{advanced}} reactor is a 640 -MWe {{pressurized water reactor}} concept developed by Asea Brown Boveri. A unique feature of PIUS {{is the absence of}} mechanical control and shutdown rods. Reactivity is controlled by coolant boron concentration and the temperature of the moderator coolant. Los Alamos supported the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission`s preapplication review of the PIUS reactor. Baseline calculations of the PIUS design were performed for active and passive reactor <b>scrams</b> using TRAC-PF 1 /MOD 2. Additional sensitivity studies examined flow blockage and boron dilution events to explore the robustness of the PIUS concept for low-probability combination events following active-system <b>scrams...</b>|$|R

25|$|During the Three Mile Island accident, slow partial {{meltdown}} of {{the reactor}} core occurred. About 19,000kg of material melted and relocated in about 2 minutes, approximately 224 {{minutes after the}} reactor <b>scram.</b> A pool of corium formed {{at the bottom of}} the reactor vessel, but the reactor vessel was not breached.

40|$|Abstract—Due {{to recent}} {{advances}} in semiconductor technologies, storage class RAMs (<b>SCRAMs)</b> such as FRAM and PRAM are emerging rapidly. Since <b>SCRAMs</b> are nonvolatile and byte-accessible, there are attempts to use these <b>SCRAMs</b> as part of nonvolatile buffer caches. A nonvolatile buffer cache provides improved consistency of file systems by absorbing write I/Os as well as improved performance. In this paper, we discuss the optimality of cache replacement algorithms in nonvolatile buffer caches and present a new algorithm called NBM (Nonvolatile-RAM-aware Buffer cache Management). NBM has three salient features. First, it separately exploits read and write histories of block references, and thus it estimates future references of each operation more precisely. Second, NBM guarantees the complete consistency of write I/Os since all dirty data are cached in nonvolatile buffer caches. Third, metadata lists are maintained separately from cached blocks. This allows more efficient management of volatile and nonvolatile buffer caches based on read and write histories, respectively. Trace-driven simulations show that NBM improves the I/O performance of file systems significantly compared to the NVLRU algorithm that is {{a modified version of}} LRU to hold dirty blocks in nonvolatile buffer caches...|$|R
50|$|The reactor was <b>scrammed</b> for {{the last}} time on at 10:33 a.m. EDT on August 29, 1997, 35 years to the day after its license had been issued. The last fuel was removed from the core on September 20. Decontamination was {{completed}} in 1999.|$|R
50|$|The time {{required}} for the water to boil away (coolant, moderator). Assuming {{that at the moment}} that the accident occurs the reactor will be <b>SCRAMed</b> (immediate and full insertion of all control rods), so reducing the thermal power input and further delaying the boiling.|$|R
25|$|At SL-1, {{control rods}} would {{get stuck in}} the control rod channel sporadically. Numerous {{procedures}} were conducted to evaluate control rods to ensure they were operating properly. There were rod drop tests and <b>scram</b> tests of each rod, in addition to periodic rod exercising and rod withdrawals for normal operation. From February 1959 to November 18, 1960, there were 40 cases of a stuck control rod for <b>scram</b> and rod drop tests and about a 2.5% failure rate. From November 18, 1960 to December 23, 1960, there was {{a dramatic increase in}} stuck rods, with 23 in that time period and a 13.0% failure rate. Besides these test failures, there were an additional 21 rod sticking incidents from February 1959 to December 1960; 4 of these had occurred in the last month of operation during routine rod withdrawal. The central control rod, No. 9, had the best operational performance record even though it was operated more frequently {{than any of the other}} rods.|$|E
25|$|Norman Hilberry (March 11, 1899 – March 28, 1986) was an American physicist, {{best known}} as the {{director}} of the Argonne National Laboratory from 1956 to 1961. In December 1942 he was the man who stood ready with an axe to cut the <b>scram</b> line during the start up of Chicago Pile-1, the world's first nuclear reactor to achieve criticality.|$|E
25|$|The 3rd {{nuclear power}} plant, Maanshan Nuclear Power Plant, of Taiwan Power Company nearby was {{affected}} by the earthquake. Because of the vigorous vibration, the alarm at Reactor #2 was activated, forcing the operators to carry out <b>SCRAM</b> immediately. However, Reactor #1 was not affected and remained operational. After the emergency shutdown of Reactor #2, engineers checked the facilities at the plant and no problems were found.|$|E
50|$|Taiwanese plants' {{performance}} has improved considerably. Their availability rose from 70% in the 1970s to 90% in the 1990s. Safety indices also improved {{as the number}} of <b>scrams</b> decreased (30 a year in 1984 to 2 or 3 a year now) and radioactive emissions decreased.|$|R
5000|$|A reactor design whose {{inherently}} safe process directly provides a passive safety component during a specific failure condition in all operational modes is typically described as relatively fail-safe to that failure condition. [...] However most current water-cooled and -moderated reactors, when <b>scrammed,</b> can not remove residual production and decay heat without either process heat transfer or the active cooling system. In other words, whilst the {{inherently safe}} heat transfer process provides a passive safety component preventing excessive heat while the reactor is operating, the same inherently safe heat transfer process {{does not provide}} a passive safety component if the reactor is shut down (<b>SCRAMed).</b> The Three Mile Island accident exposed this design deficiency: the reactor and steam generator were shut down but with loss of coolant it still suffered a partial meltdown.|$|R
50|$|Unit 2 of {{the station}} was <b>scrammed</b> from 100% power to a {{shutdown}} on June 1, 2016, at 9 am. The reactor was shut down due to an electrical fault, causing the stopping of the recirculation pumps. The steam bypass valves {{that lead to the}} main condenser were opened and Limerick went through a normal hot shutdown process.|$|R
25|$|The {{earthquake}} {{triggered a}} <b>scram</b> shut {{down of the}} three active reactors at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant (Fukushima Dai-Ichi). The ensuing tsunami crippled the site, stopped the Fukushima I backup diesel generators, and caused a station blackout. The subsequent lack of cooling led to explosions and meltdowns at the Fukushima I facility, with problems at three of the six reactors {{and in one of}} the six spent-fuel pools.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent {{study of}} SOSUS {{data from the}} time of the {{incident}} has given rise to doubts of whether or not flooding preceded the reactor <b>scram,</b> as no sound of the high pressure water impacting the compartments of the submarine could be detected on instrument recordings from SOSUS at the time, which would have been a significant sonic event, and no evidence of that can be found in the recorded data.|$|E
25|$|With {{the steam}} {{generators}} no longer receiving feedwater, heat and pressure {{increased in the}} reactor coolant system, causing the reactor to perform an emergency shutdown (<b>SCRAM).</b> Within eight seconds, control rods were inserted into the core to halt the nuclear chain reaction. The reactor continued to generate decay heat and, because steam was no longer {{being used by the}} turbine, heat was no longer being removed from the reactor's primary water loop.|$|E

25|$|In other {{reactors}} {{the coolant}} {{acts as a}} poison by absorbing neutrons {{in the same way}} that the control rods do. In these reactors power output can be increased by heating the coolant, which makes it a less dense poison. Nuclear reactors generally have automatic and manual systems to <b>scram</b> the reactor in an emergency shut down. These systems insert large amounts of poison (often boron in the form of boric acid) into the reactor to shut the fission reaction down if unsafe conditions are detected or anticipated.|$|E
25|$|The {{mass was}} found to be homogeneous, {{primarily}} composed of molten fuel and cladding. The elemental constitution was about 70wt.% uranium, 13.75wt.% zirconium, 13wt.% oxygen, with the balance being stainless steel and Inconel incorporated into the melt; the loose debris showed somewhat lower content of uranium (about 65wt.%) and higher content of structural metals. The decay heat of corium at 224 minutes after <b>scram</b> was estimated to be 0.13W/g, falling to 0.096W/g at scram+600 minutes. Noble gases, caesium and iodine were absent, signifying their volatilization from the hot material. The samples were fully oxidized, signifying the presence of sufficient amounts of steam to oxidize all available zirconium.|$|E
