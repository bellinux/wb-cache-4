This was announced by the Rotary Club of Oxford <b>Spires</b> on 7 January 2015.|$|E
50|$|<b>SPIRE</b> {{was created}} in 1934 by Edgar Archer, an {{employee}} of the Midland Cooperative Oil Association. Edgar Archer needed a loan to be able to pay his debts, so he started a credit union.

In 2011, <b>SPIRE</b> operated ten branches in the Twin Cities area. In July 2014, <b>Spire</b> was voted to move from a federally chartered financial into a state chartered financial and renamed <b>SPIRE</b> Credit Union.

50|$|The west {{tower and}} <b>spire</b> are later Medieval Perpendicular Gothic additions. The {{top of the}} <b>spire</b> is about 150 ft above ground. In the 18th century the <b>spire</b> survived three {{lightning}} strikes: in 1720, 1794 and 1797.|$|R
50|$|The local {{architect}} Lieven Cruyl made {{a design}} for a Baroque <b>spire</b> in 1684. His design was not implemented and in 1771 the campanile was finished with a <b>spire</b> after a design by architect Louis 't Kindt. A neo-Gothic <b>spire</b> of cast iron {{was placed on the}} tower in 1851. This iron <b>spire</b> was demolished between 1911-1913 and replaced by the current stone <b>spire.</b> The works were carried out under the direction of Valentin Vaerwijck whose designs were inspired by the original design from the 14th century.|$|R
5|$|A National Park Service {{spokesperson}} {{reported that}} surveys revealed cracks {{near the top}} of the Washington Monument, the world's tallest stone structure, which remained closed for repairs until May 2014. The earthquake severely damaged three of the four pinnacles (corner <b>spires)</b> on the central tower of the Washington National Cathedral, cracked some of its flying buttresses, and caused additional damage. As the cathedral's insurance policy did not cover earthquake damage, cathedral officials stated that they would need to raise millions of dollars to fully evaluate the damage and to stabilize and repair its limestone exterior.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} feature of English cathedrals, uncommon elsewhere except in Normandy, is the large and often elaborate square central tower over the crossing. The larger of these towers range from 55 metres (182ft) at Wells to 82.5 metres (271ft) at Lincoln. The central tower may exist as a single feature as at Salisbury, Gloucester, Worcester, Norwich and Chichester or in combination with paired towers at the west front as at York, Lincoln, Canterbury, Durham and Wells. Among the cathedrals that have three towers, the central tower is usually much the tallest. At Southwell the two western towers are capped by pyramidal <b>spires</b> sheathed in lead.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{has been}} used since ancient times as a durable, {{corrosion}} resistant, and weatherproof architectural material. Roofs, flashings, rain gutters, downspouts, domes, <b>spires,</b> vaults, and doors have been made from copper for {{hundreds or thousands of}} years. Copper's architectural use has been expanded in modern times to include interior and exterior wall cladding, building expansion joints, radio frequency shielding, and antimicrobial and decorative indoor products such as attractive handrails, bathroom fixtures, and counter tops. Some of copper's other important benefits as an architectural material include low thermal movement, light weight, lightning protection, and recyclability.|$|E
5000|$|A crooked <b>spire,</b> (also {{known as}} a twisted <b>spire)</b> is a tower showing a twist and/or a {{deviation}} from the vertical. A church tower usually consists of a square stone tower topped with a pyramidal wooden structure, the <b>spire.</b> The <b>spire</b> is usually clad with slates or lead to protect the wood. Through accident or design the <b>spire</b> may contain a twist, or it may not point perfectly straight upwards. Some however have been built or rebuilt with a deliberate twist, generally as a design choice.|$|R

5|$|From 1885 to 1893, the {{architect}} Helgo Zettervall (1831-1907) undertook comprehensive restoration work, seeking {{to give the}} cathedral a French High Gothic appearance although he {{has been criticized for}} not respecting the building's original Baltic Gothic style. He also added pointed French <b>spires</b> to the towers, bringing the cathedral up to a height of , so making it as high as it was long. In an attempt to give the cathedral a slimmer appearance, Zettervall significantly altered large portions of the medieval outer brick walls and removed the decorative white-washed ‘blind windows’ on the gables which had been similar to those on the nearby Holy Trinity Church.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, {{the towers}} were {{redesigned}} in the Dutch Renaissance style {{but after the}} serious fire of 1702 they were temporarily replaced by low wooden tops. At the same time, the buttresses were removed giving the cathedral the rather plain look conveyed by pictures of the period. Only in 1740 were copper-faced <b>spires</b> installed, designed by Carl Hårleman. At the same time, Hårleman carried out significant work on the west façade. Today's towers are the work of Helgo Zettervall who completely rebuilt them in the 1880s, substantially increasing their height. After the serious fire of 1702, the original flying buttresses were removed and a higher roof was built.|$|E
5|$|Szopka are {{traditional}} Polish nativity scenes dating to 19th century Kraków, Poland. Their modern construction incorporates elements of Kraków's historic architecture including Gothic <b>spires,</b> Renaissance facades, and Baroque domes, and utilizes everyday {{materials such as}} colored tinfoils, cardboard, and wood. Some are mechanized. Prizes are awarded for the most elaborately designed and decorated pieces in an annual competition held in Kraków's main square beside the statue of Adam Mickiewicz. Some of the best are then displayed in Kraków's Museum of History. Szopka were traditionally carried from door-to-door in the nativity plays (Jasełka) by performing groups.|$|E
50|$|A <b>spire</b> {{is a part}} of the coiled {{shell of}} molluscs. The <b>spire</b> {{consists}} of all of the whorls except for the body whorl. Each <b>spire</b> whorl represents a rotation of 360°. A <b>spire</b> is part of the shell of a snail, a gastropod mollusc, a gastropod shell, and also the whorls of the shell in ammonites, which are fossil shelled cephalopods. In textbook illustrations of gastropod shells, the tradition (with a few exceptions) is to show the majority of shells with the <b>spire</b> uppermost on the page.|$|R
50|$|The west {{tower and}} <b>spire</b> were rebuilt in 1883, {{re-using}} {{much of the}} original material. The bell-openings are Early English, the ogeed west window is Decorated Gothic and the parapet and <b>spire</b> are Perpendicular Gothic. The <b>spire</b> has two sets of lucarnes.|$|R
5|$|The {{steel tip}} brought the Chrysler Building to {{a height of}} , greatly {{exceeding}} 40 Wall Street's height. However, contemporary news media did not write of the <b>spire's</b> erection, nor were there any press releases celebrating the <b>spire's</b> erection. Even the New York Herald Tribune, which had virtually continuous coverage of the tower's construction, did not report on the <b>spire's</b> installation until days after the <b>spire</b> had been raised.|$|R
