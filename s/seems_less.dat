5|$|The most {{powerful}} of the Wuffingas kings was Rædwald, 'the son of Tytil, whose father was Wuffa', according to the Ecclesiastical History. For a brief period in the early seventh century, whilst Rædwald ruled, East Anglia was among the {{most powerful}} kingdoms in Anglo-Saxon England: Rædwald was described by Bede as the overlord of the kingdoms south of the Humber. In 616, he had been strong enough to defeat and kill the Northumbrian king Æthelfrith at the Battle of the River Idle and enthrone Edwin of Northumbria. He was probably the individual honoured by the sumptuous ship burial at Sutton Hoo. It has been suggested by Blair, on the strength of the parallels between some of the objects found under Mound 1 at Sutton Hoo and those discovered at Vendel in Sweden, that the Wuffingas may have been the descendants of an eastern Swedish royal family. However, as those items previously thought to have come from Sweden are now believed to have been made in England, it <b>seems</b> <b>less</b> likely that the Wuffingas were of Swedish origin.|$|E
25|$|Most {{patients}} with giant-cell glioblastoma have unfavourable prognosis, but some authors report clinical results {{slightly better than}} the ordinary glioblastoma, in all probability because this variant <b>seems</b> <b>less</b> infiltrative, {{due to the nature}} of giant cells of this type.|$|E

25|$|The {{view that}} the {{arthropod}} head must contain an acronal remnant has been shaken by the relatively recent revision of protostome phylogeny, which has dismantled the Articulata and placed the arthropods together {{with a group of}} unsegmented worms {{often referred to as the}} Cycloneuralia in the so-called Ecdysozoa. All members of the Ecdysozoa are direct developers without a trochophore, and the cycloneuralians have terminal mouths. As a result, the idea of the arthropods having inherited a preoral acron from their ancestors <b>seems</b> <b>less</b> likely.|$|E
25|$|Some animals {{would be}} living in the trees, as animals are always taking {{advantage}} of all available niches, both for feeding and protection. At the time, the reproductive organs were {{by far the most}} nutritious part of the plant, and these early plants show signs of arthropod consumption and adaptations to protect themselves, for example by placing their reproductive organs as high up as possible. But there will always be some species who will be able to cope with that by following their food source up the trees. Knowing that insects were terrestrial at that time and that some arthropods (like primitive insects) were living in the tree crowns, it <b>seems</b> <b>less</b> likely that they would have developed their wings down on the ground or in the water.|$|E
25|$|Regarding invertebrates, the {{burrowing}} owl <b>seems</b> <b>less</b> of a generalist. It is extremely fond of termites such as Termitidae, and Orthoptera such as Conocephalinae and Copiphorinae katydids, Jerusalem crickets (Stenopelmatidae) and true crickets (Gryllidae). Bothynus and Dichotomius anaglypticus scarab beetles (Scarabaeidae) were eaten {{far more often}} than even closely related species by many {{burrowing owl}}s across central São Paulo (Brazil). Similarly, {{it was noted that}} among scorpions Bothriuridae were much preferred, among spiders Lycosidae (wolf spiders), and among millipedes (Diplopoda) certain Diplocheta. Small ground beetles (Carabidae) are eaten in quantity, while larger ones are much less popular as burrowing owl food, perhaps due to the vigorous defense the large species can put up. Burrowing owls are also known to place the fecal matter of large herbivorous mammals around the outside of their burrows to attract dung beetles which are used to provide a steady source of food for the owls.|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, Paramore was {{acclaimed}} {{by music}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a [...] "weighted average" [...] rating out of 100 from selected independent ratings and reviews from mainstream critics, the album received a Metascore of 81, based on 20 reviews, indicating [...] "universal acclaim". Scott Heisel of Alternative Press praised {{the diversity of}} the album, calling the album [...] "a sprawling, 17-song, 64-minute monster", and regarded it as the best music Paramore have ever created. Entertainment Weeklys Kyle Anderson gave the album an A-, where he stated [...] "Paramore are making evolutionary leaps into something both refreshingly well-adjusted and genuinely new", and highlighted [...] "Ain't It Fun" [...] and [...] "Proof" [...] as the album's best tracks. The USA Today writer Brian Mansfield found that on the album the band [...] "has super-sized its sound". Mansfield also commented that [...] "Williams' sarcasm <b>seems</b> <b>less</b> forced than her enthusiasm, still, Paramore shows a band determined {{to get out of the}} misery business." ...|$|E

500|$|Zeta-Jones' first {{release of}} 1999 was the heist film Entrapment, {{in which she}} starred {{opposite}} Sean Connery as a seductive insurance agent {{on the lookout for}} an art thief. Despite a negative critical reception, the film was a commercial success; Janet Maslin of The New York Times thought that the film provided Zeta-Jones a platform to [...] "show off her slithery skills", and Desson Howe of The Washington Post called on viewers to appreciate the sex appeal she brought to the role. Later that year, Zeta-Jones appeared alongside Liam Neeson and Lili Taylor in The Haunting, a remake of the 1963 film of the same name about a team of paranormal experts who look into strange occurrences in an ill-fated mansion. The horror feature received generally poor reviews but found a significant worldwide audience. In a scathing review, the critic Mick LaSalle wrote that [...] "Zeta-Jones <b>seems</b> <b>less</b> an actress and more a pretty face, and not an interesting one at that".|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Zack Handlen {{reviewed}} the episode for the A.V. Club, noting that while the episode wasn't subtle, it did [...] "a good job expanding the show's world, and playing off of undercurrents and themes which have been built in throughout DS9 first season." [...] He described Winn as the [...] "most unsettling of enemies, a true believer whose faith doesn't prevent her from manipulation and deceit". [...] Handlen described the character of Vedek Winn as [...] "terrific". In her analysis of the episode, Michelle Erica Green of TrekNation said she thought the episode was [...] "pretty fantastic" [...] when she originally watched it. Upon re-watching it years later, she thought it had improved even further. Green described the episode as [...] "a no-holds-barred story about the hypocrisy of religious leaders which <b>seems</b> <b>less</b> influenced by the Scopes Trial than by contemporary creationist politicians." [...] She described Fletcher as one of her favourite actresses and thought that she portrayed Vedek Winn as the older sister of Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.|$|E
500|$|For obZen, Haake {{returned}} to the drum kit most notably with his performance on the song [...] "Bleed". In an interview for Gravemusic.com, Haake stated, [...] " [...] was a big effort for me to learn, I {{had to find a}} totally new approach to playing the double bass drums {{to be able to do}} that stuff. I had never really done anything like that before like the fast bursts that go all the way through the song basically. So I actually spent as much time practicing that track alone as I did with all of the other tracks combined. It's kind of a big feat to change your approach like that and I'm glad we were able to nail it for the album. For a while though we didn't even know if it was going to make it to the album." [...] Hagström also stated, [...] "obZen is one of the most highly technical offerings the band has ever put to tape". Revolver magazine confirms this statement: [...] "At first listen, obZen <b>seems</b> <b>less</b> challenging to the listener than some of the band's other records, and most of the songs flow smoothly from one syncopated passage to the next. However, careful examination reveals that the material is some of the group's most complicated".|$|E

500|$|In late 2003, Murphy starred as a lovelorn, hapless {{supermarket}} stocker who plots a bank heist with Colin Farrell in Intermission, {{which became}} the highest-grossing Irish independent film in Irish box office history (until The Wind That Shakes the Barley broke the record in 2006). Reflecting on his roles in 28 Days Later and the [...] "sad-sack Dublin shelf-stacker" [...] in Intermission, Sarah Lyall of the International Herald Tribune stated that Murphy brought [...] "fluent ease to the roles he takes on, a graceful and wholly believable intensity. His delicate good looks have, {{as much as his}} acting prowess, caused people to mark him as Ireland's next Colin Farrell, albeit one who <b>seems</b> <b>less</b> likely to be caught tomcatting around or brawling drunkenly at premieres". Murphy had a minor supporting role in the successful Hollywood period drama Cold Mountain. He portrayed a deserting soldier who shares a grim scene with Jude Law's character, and was only on location in Romania for a week. Murphy stated that it was a [...] "massive production", remarking that director Anthony Minghella was the calmest director he'd ever met. Murphy also had a role as a butcher in Girl with a Pearl Earring with Scarlett Johansson and Colin Firth.|$|E
500|$|Mark Edward Nero of About.com {{stated that}} [...] "Daddy" [...] was {{probably}} written {{specifically for the}} soundtrack album of Daddy's Little Girls and that it may even [...] "play a part in a pivotal scene." [...] Making reference to Beyoncé long-time relationship with Jay-Z and then recent rumors about them possibly getting married, Nero added that the song might leave several numerous fans wondering what could happen next. Marc Anthony Neal of the international webzine PopMatters considered [...] "Daddy" [...] to be the [...] "most affecting song on Dangerously in Love." [...] He went on writing that the song is an extraordinary tribute to her father Mathew Knowles, stating that Beyoncé [...] "embraces [...] the man that has helped take the kind of artistic leap that Dangerously in Love represents." [...] He ended up by adding that [...] "By the time listeners get to the fifteenth and final track, they will have been so pleasantly surprised and impressed by Beyoncé's performance throughout, that 'Daddy' <b>seems</b> <b>less</b> corny" [...] {{but it is in}} this song that she finally accepts the state of being a woman, rather than a girl. Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine described the song as an ode dedicated to the man that [...] "instilled perseverance".|$|E

2500|$|Several {{types of}} subject were recognised: banketje were [...] "banquet pieces", ontbijtjes simpler [...] "breakfast pieces".
