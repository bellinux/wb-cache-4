50|$|CP3 sportsseople with {{cerebral}} palsy are eligible to compete in swimming at the Paralympic Games. CP3 swimmers {{may be found in}} several classes. These include <b>S3,</b> <b>and</b> <b>S4.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{station is}} an {{intermediate}} {{stop on the}} St. Margrethen-Rorschach railway line, and is the lower terminus of the Rheineck-Walzenhausen mountain railway. It is served by St.Gallen S-Bahn services S2, <b>S3</b> <b>and</b> <b>S4,</b> which link Rheineck {{to the city of}} St. Gallen and other local towns, and by service S26, which shuttles up to Walzenhausen. The S2, <b>S3</b> <b>and</b> <b>S4</b> each run hourly, providing three trains per hour to and from St. Gallen, whilst the S26 operates one or two return journeys per hour, depending on the time of day.|$|R
50|$|However, only S1, S2, <b>S3</b> <b>and</b> <b>S4</b> are {{candidate}} keys (that is, minimal superkeys {{for that}} relation) because e.g. S1 ⊂ S5, so S5 cannot {{be a candidate}} key.|$|R

50|$|Similarly, {{there were}} also S-prefixed postal districts in the compass-based system used in Glasgow: the former S1, S2, <b>S3</b> <b>and</b> <b>S4</b> areas on the South Side of Glasgow now have postcodes from G41 to G44.|$|R
25|$|It {{can also}} contain {{both of these}} sounds forming a quadruple gallop, and in {{situations}} of very fast heart rate can produce a summation gallop where <b>S3</b> <b>and</b> <b>S4</b> occur so close as to be indistinguishable.|$|R
2500|$|... {{produced}} by {{the closing of the}} atrioventricular valves and semilunar valves, respectively. In addition to these normal sounds, a variety of other sounds may be present including heart murmurs, adventitious sounds, <b>and</b> gallop rhythms <b>S3</b> <b>and</b> <b>S4.</b>|$|R
50|$|Using the {{nomenclature}} above, the switches S1 and S2 {{should never}} be closed at the same time, as this would cause a short circuit on the input voltage source. The same applies to the switches <b>S3</b> <b>and</b> <b>S4.</b> This condition is known as shoot-through.|$|R
5000|$|The V8S {{has a small}} vent {{facing the}} windscreen, whereas S1 to S3 models face forward.Very late <b>S3</b> <b>and</b> <b>S4</b> models had no hump at all.As with all TVR's there is no {{specific}} point in time when they changed styles, probably when they ran out! ...|$|R
2500|$|It {{is a sign}} of a {{pathologic}} state, {{usually a}} failing or hypertrophic left ventricle, as in systemic hypertension, severe valvular aortic stenosis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The sound occurs just after atrial contraction at the end of diastole and immediately before S1, producing a rhythm sometimes referred to as the [...] "Tennessee" [...] gallop where S4 represents the [...] "Ten-" [...] syllable. It is best heard at the cardiac apex with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position and holding his breath. [...] The combined presence of <b>S3</b> <b>and</b> <b>S4</b> is a quadruple gallop, also known as the [...] "Hello-Goodbye" [...] gallop. At rapid heart rates, <b>S3</b> <b>and</b> <b>S4</b> may merge to produce a summation gallop, sometimes referred to as S7.|$|R
50|$|Finally, the S4 {{cars were}} an interim model that used the TVR M Series chassis with the Vixen body shell. Apart from the chassis, {{there were no}} {{significant}} mechanical or cosmetic changes between the <b>S3</b> <b>and</b> <b>S4.</b> Twenty-two were built in 1972 and one in 1973.|$|R
50|$|Haßloch has at its {{disposal}} good {{transport links}} towards the region’s centre (Mannheim/Ludwigshafen/Heidelberg), be it by Autobahn A 65 or the RheinNeckar S-Bahn. S-Bahn lines S1, S2 - and mornings <b>and</b> evenings <b>S3</b> <b>and</b> <b>S4</b> - run every 15 minutes during peak times from Haßloch station.|$|R
50|$|Langen {{station is}} on the Rhine-Main S-Bahn network running on the Main-Neckar line and is served by S-Bahn lines <b>S3</b> <b>and</b> <b>S4.</b> The travel time to {{downtown}} Frankfurt is roughly 20 minutes with trains running every 15 minutes. Moreover, regional trains on the Frankfurt-Mannheim and Frankfurt-Heidelberg runs stop here.|$|R
5000|$|Rheineck {{railway station}} is {{situated}} on the St. Margrethen-Rorschach railway line, which is served by St.Gallen S-Bahn services S2, <b>S3</b> <b>and</b> <b>S4</b> providing several trains per hour {{to the city of}} St. Gallen. Additionally, the Rheineck-Walzenhausen mountain railway links the station to Walzenhausen, 272 m above Rheineck, once or twice an hour.|$|R
50|$|An {{interpretation}} where <b>S3</b> <b>and</b> <b>S4</b> are or were {{a single}} object on a F-ring crossing orbit is also possible. Such an object {{might also be}} orbiting at a slightly different inclination to the F ring, thereby not actually passing through the ring material despite being seen both radially inward and outward of it.|$|R
50|$|Flight day 6 saw mission specialists Patrick Forrester and Steven Swanson {{perform the}} second of four planned spacewalks. The main task of the spacewalk was to prepare the Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ) between the <b>S3</b> <b>and</b> <b>S4</b> Truss {{segments}} for rotation. The two spacewalkers and their crew mates were awakened at 13:08 UTC to begin the day's activities.|$|R
5000|$|The V6 S Series cars used Ford's Cologne V6 in 2.8 L, 160 hp (S1) and 2.9 L, 170 hp (S2-S4) forms. The early [...] "S" [...] {{cars are}} often {{referred}} to as [...] "S1"s, to distinguish them from later iterations. The <b>S3</b> <b>and</b> <b>S4</b> received longer doors, although some late S2's were also thus equipped.|$|R
5000|$|Vehicle models {{ending with}} [...] "C" [...] {{were used to}} denote {{vehicles}} which were fitted with a catalytic converter. Only the <b>S3</b> <b>and</b> <b>S4</b> were fitted with catalysts. Cat standard in the UK was only introduced in August 1992, at [...] "K" [...] registration, catalyzed earlier cars were intended for export to markets with tighter emissions standards.|$|R
5000|$|Phrixotoxin-1 and -2 bind to A-type, transient, {{voltage-gated}} potassium channels, {{near the}} <b>S3</b> <b>and</b> <b>S4</b> segments, where they negatively affect transmembrane {{movement of the}} voltage sensing domain in response to depolarizing voltages. They bind preferentially to the closed or inactivated state of Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 channels. [...] Phrixotoxin-3 (PaurTx3) inhibits several voltage gated sodium channel subtypes (Nav1.1/SCN1A, Nav1.2/SCN2A, Nav1.4/SCN4A, Nav1.5/SCN5A, and Nav1.8/SCN10A) [...]|$|R
50|$|NovaSeq: Illumina {{launched}} the NovaSeq Series in January 2017. There are two configurations of the NovaSeq including the NovaSeq 5000 and the NovaSeq 6000. The NovaSeq 5000 {{has the capacity}} to run up to two flow cells at a time, with 2 flow cell options to choose from. The highest throughput flowcell (S2) can process up to 3.3 billion reads and generate up to 1000 Gb of data (with 150 bp read lengths). The NovaSeq 6000 can run four flow-cell formats, including S1, S2, <b>S3</b> <b>and</b> <b>S4.</b> The <b>S3</b> <b>and</b> <b>S4</b> flow cells will generate up to 4 Tb and 6 Tb of data, respectively, in two and a half days. Read lengths for these outputs are 2x150 bases. The system is compatible with Illumina library preparation kits and can support virtually any sequencing application — whole genome sequencing, whole transcriptomes, whole exomes, metagenomics and more. Users can sequence any species using any application.|$|R
5000|$|In other tuning systems, a comma may {{be defined}} as a minute interval, equal to the {{difference}} between two kinds of semitones (diatonic and chromatic, also known as minor second, m2, or augmented unison, A1). In this case, however, 4 different kinds of semitones are produced (two A1, S1 and S2, <b>and</b> two m2, <b>S3</b> <b>and</b> <b>S4),</b> <b>and</b> 12 different commas can be defined as the differences between their sizes in cents, or equivalently as the ratios between their ratios. Among these, we select the six ascending ones (those with ratio larger than 1/1, and positive size in cents): ...|$|R
50|$|TLTx1 {{acts as a}} gating {{modifier}} on Kv4.2 channels. TLTx1 {{shifts the}} voltage dependence of activation of Kv4.2 channels to more positive potentials, slows its activation and speeds up its deactivation kinetics. Additionally, TLTx decreases their rate of inactivation. The binding site that TLTx most likely interacts with is the linker region between the transmembrane segments <b>S3</b> <b>and</b> <b>S4.</b> In addition, the S1-S2 and S5-S6 loops may also play a role.|$|R
50|$|The Scottish Qualifications Credit Framework (SCQF) {{contains}} 12 levels {{ranging from}} Access at SCQF level 1, up to Doctorate at level 12. SCQF Level 3 {{refers to the}} national qualifications taken over two years of study (in <b>S3</b> <b>and</b> <b>S4)</b> with exams {{at the end of}} S4. The proportion of S4 Pupils attaining SCQF Level 3 or above during 2009/10 was 91%, which was marginally below the Fife and Scottish averages of 92%.|$|R
50|$|In healthy adults, {{there are}} two normal heart sounds often {{described}} as a lub and a dub (or dup), that occur in sequence with each heartbeat. These are the first heart sound (S1) and second heart sound (S2),produced by {{the closing of the}} atrioventricular valves and semilunar valves, respectively. In addition to these normal sounds, a variety of other sounds may be present including heart murmurs, adventitious sounds, <b>and</b> gallop rhythms <b>S3</b> <b>and</b> <b>S4.</b>|$|R
50|$|Regional-Express trains stop only in Frankfurt, Langen, Darmstadt, Bickenbach, Bensheim, Heppenheim, Hemsbach, Weinheim and Ladenburg. Regionalbahn trains stop between Frankfurt and Darmstadt only in Langen, {{then stop}} at all {{stations}}. Lützelsachsen and Großsachsen-Heddesheim stations are served {{every two hours}} only. Stations between Frankfurt and Darmstadt via Frankfurt South are served by S-Bahn lines <b>S3</b> <b>and</b> <b>S4.</b> Between 5 AM and midnight trains run every hour and during peak hours every 30 minutes.|$|R
50|$|Heidelberg-Kirchheim/Rohrbach {{station is}} the second busiest station after Heidelberg Hauptbahnhof {{in the city of}} Heidelberg in the German state of Baden-Württemberg. It is {{classified}} by Deutsche Bahn (DB) as a category 4 station. It has three platforms and it is in the area where fares are set by the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar (Rhine-Neckar Transport Association, VRN). Since December 2003, it has been almost exclusively served by services on lines <b>S3</b> <b>and</b> <b>S4</b> of the Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn.|$|R
5000|$|Dreieich {{lies within}} the area {{covered by the}} Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund.

The DB Regio Regionalbahnen run half-hourly on weekdays and hourly on weekends. In rush hours a few trains run directly to Frankfurt Main Railway Station from Dreieich-Buchschlag. Furthermore, some buslines serve the town: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{station is}} on the [...] Schifferstadt-Wörth line and is a stop for Regional-Express {{services}} from Mainz to Karlsruhe <b>and</b> S-Bahn lines <b>S3</b> <b>and</b> <b>S4</b> of the Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn. Public transport in Speyer is organised by the Rhine-Neckar Transport Association (Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar). The station is located about one kilometre from the city centre. The inner city {{can be reached by}} buses operated by Busverkehr Rhein-Neckar (BRN) in five minutes. Until 1945, the Heidelberg-Speyer railway also terminated at the station.|$|R
50|$|S4 {{has also}} been termed an atrial gallop or a presystolic gallop because of its {{occurrence}} late in the heart cycle. It {{is a type of}} gallop rhythm by virtue of having an extra sound; the other gallop rhythm is called S3. The two are quite different, but they may sometimes occur together forming a quadruple gallop. If the heart rate is also very fast (tachycardia), it can become difficult to distinguish between <b>S3</b> <b>and</b> <b>S4</b> thus producing a single sound called a summation gallop.|$|R
