50|$|A {{lifting hook}} is a device for {{grabbing}} and lifting loads {{by means of}} a device such as a hoist or crane. A lifting hook is usually equipped with a <b>safety</b> <b>latch</b> to prevent the disengagement of the lifting wire rope sling, chain or rope to which the load is attached.|$|E
50|$|A {{linoleum}} knife (also {{called a}} banana knife or hook axe) {{is a small}} knife that has a short, stiff blade with a curved point and a handle and is used to cut linoleum or other sheet materials such as wood panelling and veneer and sheet mica. The knife is similar in design to the sickle and billhook. Like most cutting tools with hooked blades, {{the purpose of this}} design is to cut by pulling. This helps to reduce the wasted effort of simultaneously pressing the blade into the item as one would with a straight blade. It also allows the user to reach out and cut an item with the arm fully extended, such as during plant trimming or harvesting, or making a long continuous cut into a surface. This tool {{can also be used to}} pick locks by bypassing the <b>safety</b> <b>latch</b> in the doorjamb. Knives of a similar shape and design are commonly used by carpet fitters.|$|E
50|$|The Natter had no landing gear, which saved weight, {{expense and}} {{construction}} time. Consequently, {{one of the}} most unusual features of the machine was the escape of the pilot and recovery of the machine. The proposed sequence of these events was as follows: After the attack, the Natter might dive to a lower altitude and flatten out into level flight. The pilot would then proceed with a well-practised escape sequence. He would open the cockpit canopy latch; the canopy flicking backwards on its hinge in the airstream; he would undo his seat belt and remove his feet from the rudder pedal stirrups. By squeezing a lever mounted on the control column, he would release a lock {{at the base of the}} column, which would allow him to tilt the column forwards where it could engage in and undo a <b>safety</b> <b>latch</b> for the nose release mechanism. He would then lean a little further forward and pull a lever hinged near the floor at the front of the cockpit. This action frees the nose section, which self-jettisoned as a result of the reduced aerodynamic pressure at the front of the fuselage. As the nose section separates, it was intended to briefly pull on two cables that release a small ribbon parachute stored on the starboard side of the rear fuselage. The parachute subsequently opens and decelerates the Natter. The pilot would be ejected from the cockpit by his own inertia and as soon as he was clear of the fuselage, he would open his personal parachute and descend to the ground.|$|E

50|$|The {{transformation}} {{is made possible}} by a centrally located electric motor, which stretches the vehicle with the help of two mechanical screw-and-nut gears by exactly 746 millimetres to its full extended length of 3.74 metres. The longitudinal members run on low-friction precision rollers and disappear like a drawer {{in the rear of the}} floor pan. Despite its variable length the engineers succeeded in designing the adjustable floor pan with the torsional rigidity necessary for a roadster. To ensure absolute operational safety the extension mechanism also features self-locking <b>safety</b> <b>latches.</b> The car lacks a roof and doors.|$|R
40|$|The ECCO strobe tester is a {{specialized}} bed of nails tester for LED strobe boards. This tester {{can handle a}} variety of products and functions using only a PIC microcontroller. The bed of nails allows for multiple tests locations on the various boards, but is modular enough to incorporate new board designs. This tester reduces product testing time, provides instantaneous test results, and data logging for test result analysis. The user interface {{is designed to be}} as simple as possible through the use of an LCD and menu controls. The housing has built in <b>safety</b> <b>latches</b> and a flash capacitor discharger to prevent accidental shock. This tester is fast, safe, modular, and accurate...|$|R
40|$|The {{calculation}} decides {{the integrity}} of the <b>safety</b> <b>latch</b> that will hold the strong-back to the pump during lifting. The <b>safety</b> <b>latch</b> will be welded to the strong-back and will latch to a 1. 5 -in. dia cantilever rod welded to the pump baseplate. The static and dynamic analysis shows that the <b>safety</b> <b>latch</b> will hold the strong-back to the pump if the friction clamps fail and the pump become free from the strong-back. Thus, the <b>safety</b> <b>latch</b> will meet the requirements of the Lifting and Rigging Manual for under the hook lifting for static loading; it can withstand shock loads from the strong-back falling 0. 25 inch...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. There is {{a paucity}} of data {{regarding}} EMS stretcher-operation-related injuries. This study describes and analyzes characteristics associated with undesirable stretcher operations, with or without resultant injury in a large, urban EMS agency. Methods. In the study agency, all stretcher-related “misadventures” are required to be documented, regardless of whether injury results. All stretcher-related reports between July 1, 2009 and June 30, 2010 were queried in retrospective analysis, avoiding Hawthorne effect in stretcher operations. Results. During the year studied, 129, 110 patients were transported. 23 stretcher incidents were reported (0. 16 per 1, 000 transports). No patient injury occurred. Four EMS providers sustained minor injuries. Among contributing aspects, the most common involved operations surrounding the stretcher-ambulance <b>safety</b> <b>latch,</b> 14 / 23 (60. 9 %). From a personnel injury prevention perspective, there exists {{a significant relationship between}} combative patients and crew injury related to stretcher operation, Fisher’s exact test 0. 048. Conclusions. In this large, urban EMS system, the incidence of injury related to stretcher operations in the one-year study period is markedly low, with few personnel injuries and no patient injuries incurred.

2500|$|In {{the weeks}} that {{followed}} Hart's death, much attention was focused on the harness Hart used that night, especially on the [...] "quick release" [...] trigger and <b>safety</b> <b>latches.</b> When someone is lowered from the rafters in a harness, there are backup latches that must be <b>latched</b> for <b>safety</b> purposes. [...] Four weeks after the event, the Hart family sued the WWF over how dangerous and poorly planned the stunt was, and that the harness system was defective. After over {{a year and a half}} into the case, a settlement was reached on November 2, 2000, which saw the WWF give the Hart family US$18 million. The manufacturer of the harness system was also a defendant against the Hart family, but they were dismissed from the case after the settlement was reached. Martha used millions of the settlement to establish the Owen Hart Foundation. Martha wrote a book about Hart's life in 2002 called Broken Harts: The Life and Death of Owen Hart.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{pilot study}} evaluates the {{effectiveness}} of a community based childhood injury prevention program on the reduction of home hazards. METHODS: High risk pregnant women, who were enrolled in a home visiting program that augments existing health and human services, received initial home safety assessments. Clients received education about injury prevention practices, in addition to receiving selected home safety supplies. Fourteen questions from the initial assessment tool were repeated upon discharge from the program. Matched analyses were conducted to evaluate differences from initial assessment to discharge. RESULTS: A significantly larger proportion of homes were assessed as safe at discharge, compared with the initial assessment, for the following hazards: children riding unbuckled in all auto travel, Massachusetts Poison Center sticker on the telephone, outlet plugs in all unused electrical outlets, <b>safety</b> <b>latches</b> on cabinets and drawers, and syrup of ipecac in the home. CONCLUSIONS: A community based childhood injury prevention program providing education and safety supplies to clients significantly reduced four home hazards for which safety supplies were provided. Education and promotion of the proper use of child restraint systems in automobiles significantly reduced a fifth hazard, children riding unbuckled in auto travel. This program appears to reduce the prevalence of home hazards and, therefore, to increase home safety...|$|R
