5|$|When Rand {{first arrived}} in New York as an {{immigrant}} from the Soviet Union in 1926, she was greatly impressed by the Manhattan skyline's towering skyscrapers, which she saw as symbols of freedom, and resolved that she would write about them. In 1927, Rand {{was working as a}} junior screenwriter for movie producer Cecil B. DeMille when he asked her to write a script for what would become the 1928 film <b>Skyscraper.</b> The original story by Dudley Murphy was about two construction workers working on a <b>skyscraper</b> who are rivals for a woman's love. Rand rewrote it, transforming the rivals into architects. One of them, Howard Kane, was an idealist dedicated to erecting the <b>skyscraper</b> despite enormous obstacles. The film would have ended with Kane standing atop the completed <b>skyscraper.</b> DeMille rejected Rand's script, and the completed film followed Murphy's original idea. Rand's version contained elements she would use in The Fountainhead.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the effects of <b>skyscrapers</b> on the flow and dispersion characteristics in metropolitan area. For this, a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model with the renormalization group (RNG) k-ε turbulence model is employed. To examine the <b>skyscrapers</b> effects, two building configurations (with/without <b>skyscrapers)</b> are considered. For each configuration, three cases with different ambient wind directions (westerly, southwesterly and southerly) are examined. In the absence of the <b>skyscrapers,</b> monotonous wind patterns are shown. The results show that the <b>skyscrapers</b> affected the variation of flow field nearby significantly. Within the <b>skyscrapers,</b> wind speed increased compared with that in the case without the <b>skyscrapers.</b> The increase in wind speed, channeling effect, is caused to satisfy the mass continuity. On the other hand, at the downwind region, wind speed decreased compared with that in the case without the <b>skyscrapers</b> due to the drag effect of the <b>skyscrapers.</b> The results of the dispersion model assuming the line sources with the constant emission rate showed that increased at the downwind region after construction of the <b>skyscrapers...</b>|$|R

25|$|One common {{feature of}} <b>skyscrapers</b> is a steel {{framework}} from which curtain walls are suspended, rather than load-bearing walls of conventional construction. Most <b>skyscrapers</b> have a steel frame that {{enables them to}} be built taller than typical load-bearing walls of reinforced concrete. <b>Skyscrapers</b> usually have a particularly small surface area of what are conventionally thought of as walls. Because the walls are not load-bearing most <b>skyscrapers</b> are characterized by surface areas of windows made possible by the concept of steel frame and curtain wall. However, <b>skyscrapers</b> can also have curtain walls that mimick conventional walls and have a small surface area of windows.|$|R

50|$|World {{economies and}} major {{construction}} companies are driven {{in part by}} building megaprojects, the most prominent component of which is one or more <b>skyscrapers.</b> Planetizen has opened up the debate on <b>skyscrapers</b> more than once. A city has to balance the drive to build high, using high-tech, with the theoretical objections that <b>skyscrapers</b> drain the resources and energy from the region {{in which they are}} implanted. New <b>skyscrapers</b> are claimed to be ecosustainable, but those claims have as many critics as they have proponents. Again, {{there is a need for}} a broad debate, and Planetizen contains many different and dissenting viewpoints on the question of <b>skyscrapers</b> as a viable building typology.|$|R

5|$|<b>Skyscraper</b> {{development}} paused {{during the}} years of the Second World War. Once development began again in the 1950s and 1960s, the <b>skyscraper</b> entered a different phase of development, usually called the international or modern period. Some experimental designs in this style had been built in the U.S. using European architectural concepts in the early 1930s, most notably the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society and McGraw-Hill Buildings. Post-war, their modernist themes were used in a new generation of skyscrapers. These stood alone on individual plots in the fashion of the Rockefeller Centre's RCA building, rather than as part of a row of buildings, forming huge slabs and towers featuring huge glass façades, breaking with earlier <b>skyscraper</b> traditions. Inside, new technologies such as fluorescent lighting and widespread air-conditioning meant that many older architectural features such as light courts and operable windows were unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|The Master Apartments, officially {{known as}} the Master Building, is a {{landmark}} 27-story Art Deco <b>skyscraper</b> at 310 Riverside Drive, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York City. It sits on {{the northeast corner of}} Riverside Drive and West 103rd Street. The Master Apartments is one of the city's first mixed-use structures as well as the tallest building on Riverside Drive. It was the first <b>skyscraper</b> in New York City to feature corner windows and the first to employ brick in varying colors for its entire exterior.|$|E

25|$|Modern skyscrapers' {{walls are}} not load-bearing, and most <b>skyscrapers</b> are {{characterized}} by large surface areas of windows made possible by steel frames and curtain walls. However, <b>skyscrapers</b> can have curtain walls that mimic conventional walls with a small surface area of windows. Modern <b>skyscrapers</b> often have a tubular structure, and are designed {{to act like a}} hollow cylinder to resist wind, seismic, and other lateral loads. To appear more slender, allow less wind exposure, and transmit more daylight to the ground, many <b>skyscrapers</b> have a design with setbacks, which are sometimes also structurally required.|$|R

However, since the 10-story building did not surpass the steeple of the Fort Street Presbyterian Church, it never became a city record holder. The first <b>skyscraper</b> to have {{the distinction of being}} Detroit's tallest building was the Ford Building, completed in 1909.|$|E

40|$|<b>Skyscrapers</b> are, literally, {{prominent}} features of many cities. They are increasingly dominating urban skylines around the world. <b>Skyscrapers</b> are advantageous for certain constituents, architects and builders who design and construct {{them and the}} politicians and corporate tenants who believe that large, upwardly thrusting symbols have promotional and competitive benefits. However, {{in the context of}} tourism, except for the very few that are distinctively tall, <b>skyscrapers</b> are not merely ineffective as attractions, they create unpleasant contexts for urban tourism, eroding the quality of leisure, the foundation of recreational and cultural experiences at the core of tourism. Thus, attempts to promote tourism with images of skylines dominated by tall buildings might be counter-productive in the end analysis. This implies that Asian cities where most of the world 2 ̆ 7 s <b>skyscrapers</b> are being constructed should re-examine the role of <b>skyscrapers</b> in promoting tourism, especially, considering that many European cities that have sustained popularity as tourist destinations lack <b>skyscrapers...</b>|$|R

5|$|Bellevue's {{history of}} skyscrapers {{began with the}} {{completion}} of the Paccar Tower in 1970; this structure is regarded as the city's first high-rise. High-rise building construction remained slow until 1982, when the city's first <b>skyscraper</b> building boom took shape. Eight of the city's 24 tallest buildings were completed within the next seven years, including City Center Bellevue, which was the tallest building in Bellevue for almost two decades. The <b>skyscraper</b> construction boom ended in 1989, and subsequently only one high-rise which ranked among the city's tallest structures was completed in the 1990s. Beginning in 2000, Bellevue entered into a second, much larger building boom that continued to 2010. More than half of Bellevue's twenty tallest buildings were completed after 2000; nine projects were completed in 2008 alone, including Bellevue Towers. Overall, Bellevue's skyline is ranked third in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, after Seattle and Portland.|$|E

25|$|<b>Skyscrapers</b> {{are rarely}} seen in small cities {{and they are}} {{characteristic}} of large cities, because of the critical importance of high land prices {{for the construction of}} <b>skyscrapers.</b> Usually only office, commercial and hotel users can afford the rents in the city center and thus most tenants of <b>skyscrapers</b> are of these classes. Some <b>skyscrapers</b> have been built in areas where the bedrock is near surface, because this makes constructing the foundation cheaper, for example this is the case in Midtown Manhattan and Lower Manhattan, in New York City, but not in-between these two parts of the city.|$|R
