5|$|William McKinley {{was born}} in Niles, Ohio in 1843. He left college {{to work as a}} teacher, and enlisted in the Union Army when the American Civil War broke out in 1861. He served {{throughout}} the war, ending it as a brevet major. Afterwards, he attended Albany Law <b>School</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> state, and was admitted to the bar in Ohio. He settled in Canton, Ohio; after practicing law there, he was elected to Congress in 1876, and except for short periods served there until 1891. In 1890 he was defeated for re-election, but he was elected governor the following year, serving two two-year terms.|$|E
5|$|After the {{war ended}} in 1865, McKinley decided on {{a career in the}} law and began {{studying}} in the office of an attorney in Poland, Ohio. The following year, he continued his studies by attending Albany Law <b>School</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> After studying there for less than a year, McKinley returned home and was admitted to the bar in Warren, Ohio, in March 1867. That same year, he moved to Canton, the county seat of Stark County, and set up a small office. He soon formed a partnership with George W. Belden, an experienced lawyer and former judge. His practice was successful enough for him to buy a block of buildings on Main Street in Canton, which provided him with a small but consistent rental income for decades to come. When his Army friend Rutherford B. Hayes was nominated for governor in 1867, McKinley made speeches on his behalf in Stark County, his first foray into politics. The county was closely divided between Democrats and Republicans, but Hayes carried it that year in his statewide victory. In 1869, McKinley ran for the office of prosecuting attorney of Stark County, an office usually then held by Democrats, and was unexpectedly elected. When McKinley ran for re-election in 1871, the Democrats nominated William A. Lynch, a prominent local lawyer, and McKinley was defeated by 143 votes.|$|E
