40|$|The author Mike Davis has {{labelled}} {{our entire}} globe as a planet of slums. This hesis aims {{to provide some}} insights to the research field of <b>slum</b> <b>rehabilitation,</b> and thus contribution to efforts to make our globe slum free. The United Nations states that security of tenure {{is one of the}} essential preconditions for improvements in slums. The statement comes with support from academic research, which highlights the relation between secure tenure and a slums physical quality. Out of these messages two hypotheses are formulated and tested throughout the thesis; one theoretical, the other empirical. The theoretical section holds that tenure should be studied according to property rights and tenure status, that interventions for <b>slum</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> should support the dwellers efforts of incremental development, that tenure is granted in both the informal and formal land market, and that there are several causalities between secure tenure and the quality of housing and infrastructure. The case study examines 208 informal settlements in terms of their living conditions in the city of Pune, India. The thesis draws on empirical data {{in the form of a}} citywide slum survey that has been made available by the non-governmental organisations, Maharashtra Action League and CHF International, both of which operate in Pune.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of housing quality on {{well-being}} by comparing a sample of low-income women living in two different housing conditions: slum housing and public housing. Interviews, questionnaires and observations were used {{to collect data on}} quality of housing, wellbeing aspects, and demographic factors. T-tests and multiple linear regression models were used to statistically analyze the difference in housing conditions and well-being between the two groups and to understand the effect of housing quality on well-being. Bootstrapping method was also used to examine housing quality as an underlying mechanism in the association between housing site and well-being. Household income, educational attainment and employment status were used as statistical controls. Results {{of this study suggest that}} housing quality and overall well-being were better in women living in public housing in comparison to women in slum housing.

40|$|International audienceUrban {{governance}} {{today is}} characterised by {{the multiplicity of}} actors involved {{in the management of}} local affairs. The questions for inquiry are: who are the individuals and institutions, public and private, who actually plan and manage urban affairs? In what ways do they do so? Whose interests are accommodated, and under what conditions can co-operative action be taken? And more generally, in what ways are interactions between the many actors of urban governance patterned? This volume discusses the governance of Indian metropolises with these questions in mind, and focuses especially on changes brought on by policies of liberalisation and decentralisation over the last 15 years. Governance is here analysed through a series of case studies from Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Hyderabad, focusing on six collective services: primary education, healthcare, subsidised food, <b>slum</b> <b>rehabilitation,</b> water and sanitation, and solid waste management. The book documents the continued appropriation of the state by an enlarged elite (including the vast middle class) and an incomplete democratisation of urban local bodies (evident in the lack of empowerment of municipal councillors), which goes along with a new economic regime as defined by new modes of engagement between the private sector and the state. Also, the concept of governance as it is operationalized in this volume highlights the importance of class in interactions between actors. By disentangling formal elements of governance (legitimised by the state) from informal ones (involving actors who are beyond the recognition of the state) the book ultimately reveals various power equations at play...|$|E
40|$|This essay recounts a {{struggle}} over the demolition of Goli-bar, a slum in Mumbai. Such struggles are not uncommon in contemporary India. Urban space is being reorganized across the country, both {{to meet the needs}} of economic growth and to take advantage of rapidly growing real estate values. The struggle in Golibar situates global capital and state actors in opposition to slum dwellers who occupy land that has suddenly become extremely valuable. The <b>Slum</b> <b>Rehabilitation</b> Act of the state of Maharashtra provides Mumbaikars with better tools than other Indian slum dwellers have to make their voices heard in urban redevelopment. In contrast, for example, Delhi slum dwellers are often simply evicted violently. But the case is not simply interesting as an example of such struggles. Instead, we are interested in the case because it represents a chal-lenge to the way we think about cities and the struggles that take place in them. Today urbanists think about cities not as integrated wholes but as agglomerations of balkanized communities, economies, and ways of life. Among these, the poor are often thought to be characterized by narrow materialistic concerns with few aspirations for the city as a whole. The case of Golibar challenges this thinking and suggests that slum dwell-ers are potential agents for realizing a universalist, liberal, and egalitarian city, an ethos that rests on an aspiration for inclusion in the Global City, not simple economic well- being. It is often assumed that the expanding middle and profes-sional classes will be the agents for realizing such an integrative and cosmopoli...|$|E
40|$|The {{world is}} urbanizing and many cities in {{developing}} countries are unable to accommodate the masses of new city residents. Slums are an immediate response to this process, and in India over 50 % of the urban population lives in slums. Different ideas and methods of slum reduction have been present in India during the 20 th century, which started off {{with a focus on}} slum clearance. As pure slum clearance eventually turned out to be unsuccessful in practise as slum dwellers remained unable to integrate in the formal housing market, but simply rebuilt their huts illegally, clearance in combination with resettling on a new location instead became the prevailing idea. This method is still in practice in India, and pre-fabricated residential buildings (often in form of multi-storey slab blocks) are built by the government all over the country. Through the work of many NGO’s, new ways of handling urban slums are however coming. Slum upgrading where the existing structures are upgraded insitu in collaboration with the slum community is an increasingly used method, although still in very small scale. SPARC, a major actor on the Indian NGO scene, has for example tried to use these methods in a slum upgrading project in Pune where only selected houses of poor quality were demolished and rebuilt, and the rest was upgraded. The problem is that these alternative ideas of <b>slum</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> are still rare, and the dominating methods of pre-fabricated, multi-storey projects are generally unsuccessful. On the wide-ranging level, one could say that they are unsustainable; socially (because they alter the slum dwellers’ social networks), economically (because they are not adapted to slum dwellers’ economic situation and income-generating strategies) and environmentally (because they don’t take existing structures and materials in consideration). In Bangalore in Karnataka, southern India, the number of slum dweller is lower than the national average, but still high enough to involve around two million people. Bangalore is a segregated city with remains of separation from colonial times. Gated communities and secure shopping malls arise next to small slum pockets. As the “high-tech” capital of India, it is rapidly expanding, and a new metro line is under construction. 1, 200 of Bangalore’s slum dwellers live in Leprosy Colony, an old leprosy slum close to the central railway station. The settlement is old and overcrowded and lacks sanitary facilities and clean water. However, the slum also displays some fine qualities in terms of variation, flexibility, human scale, street life and social capital, as well as 40 % stable, permanent buildings which could be upgraded rather than demolished. The aim of the thesis is to gain a greater understanding of the use, functions and potential improvements of slum settlements, with the focus on Leprosy Colony. It intends to look at <b>slum</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> issues from a planner’s perspective, of public space and of the role and layout of a ‘non-planned’ settlement. The project have been carried out through a differentiated methodological approach of literature analysis; observation; documentation; interviews and proposal work, where the literature analysis and proposal work were performed mainly in Sweden, and observation, documentation and interviews were carried out mainly in India. The proposal work resulted in a slum upgrading proposal for Leprosy Colony, IN_SITU, built up by six conceptual strategies; Improved connectivity; rail and road bridging structures; reinforced network of public realm; a flexible anti-flood system; incremental housing; framework for neighborhood expansion. These form a proposal of a flexible character, which takes its departure in the existing conditions and possibilities of the slum...|$|E
