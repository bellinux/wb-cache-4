Two acid dyes with different molecular sizes were used, namely Acid Yellow 117 (AY 117) and Acid Blue 25 (AB 25).

A higher adsorption of phenanthrene was observed with all sorbents, which {{is related to}} the better accessibility of smaller molecules to micropores in the molecular sieve sorbents. In addition, pyrene sorption in binary-solute systems with a constant initial concentration of phenanthrene (0. 1 μmol L(- 1) or 2 μmol L(- 1)) was studied. A 0. 1 μmol L(- 1) concentration of phenanthrene causes no competitive effect on the pyrene sorption. A 2 μmol L(- 1) concentration of phenanthrene significantly suppresses the sorption of pyrene, especially in the low concentration range; nonlinearity of the pyrene sorption isotherms thus decreases.

40|$|Abstract—The {{retrieval}} of plant biophysical and biochemical properties from high spectral resolution data represents an active {{area of research}} within the remote sensing field. Scientific studies {{in this area are}} usually supported by computational simulations of light attenuation processes within foliar tissues. In heterogeneous organic materials, like plant leaves, sieve and detour effects can affect these processes and ultimately change the light gradients within these tissues and their spectral signatures. Although these effects have been extensively examined for applications involving the interactions of visible radiation with plant leaves, little is known about their role in the infrared domain. In this paper, we describe the procedural basis for their incorporation in the model-ing of infrared-radiation transport (in the range of 750 – 2500 nm) within plant leaves. We also assess their impact on the predict-ability of simulation solutions relating the directionality of the incident radiation and the internal arrangement of the tissues to changes on foliar spectral signatures in this domain.

In this thesis, a ray optics framework is proposed to estimate the sieve factor for blood samples using a first principles approach. It consists in applying ray-casting techniques to determine the probability that light can traverse a blood sample without encountering any of the pigment (hemoglobin) containing cells. The thickness of the samples as well as the distribution, orientation and shape of the red blood cells are taken into account by the simulation algorithm employed in this framework. The predictive capabilities of the proposed approach are demonstrated through a series of in silico experiments.

Eight of 19 (42 %) placebo recipients were productively infected by more than 1 virus (range 1 – 5, median 1, mean 1. 7). This frequency of multiple virus transmission was greater than reported for heterosexual co-horts (19 %, P =. 03) but not statistically different from vaccine recipients (22. 6 %, P>. 05), where the range was 1 – 3, median 1, and mean 1. 3 (P>. 05 for all comparisons).

In HIV- 1 vaccine development efforts to date only a single HIV- 1 vaccine trial has shown any efficacy by either of these measures. Despite this lack of success, we hope to inform future vaccine design by analyzing vaccine effects in HIV- 1 vaccine trials. We expect to detect these effects through one of three measures: 1) differential vaccine-elicited responses among cases and controls in an immune correlates of risk analysis, 2) differential host genetics by treatment assignment among infected trial participants, or 3) differential viral genetics of breakthrough infecting strains by treatment assignment of the host (known as a <b>sieve</b> <b>effect).</b> In this thesis we begin by developing methods for aggregating biomarkers for use in an immune correlates of risk analysis via antigenic maps. We show that antigenic maps {{can be used as}} a bridge to understand connections between immune correlates of risk analysis results, differential host genetics and local effects in a sieve analysis. Next, we discuss the critical step of identifying panels of antigens for use in bioassays that can be used to generate antigenic maps and compare immune response outcomes between HIV- 1 vaccine trials. The last part of this thesis develops sieve analysis methods that focus on epitopes, the underlying unit of the adaptive immune system response...|$|E
40|$|The most {{relevant}} endpoint in therapeutic HIV vaccination is {{the assessment of}} time to viral rebound or duration of sustained control of low-level viremia upon cART treatment cessation. Structured treatment interruptions (STI) are however not without risk to the patient and reliable predictors of viral rebound/control after therapeutic HIV- 1 vaccination are urgently needed to ensure patient safety and guide therapeutic vaccine development. Here, we integrated immunological and virological parameters together with viral rebound dynamics after STI in a phase I therapeutic vaccine trial of a polyvalent MVA-B vaccine candidate to define predictors of viral control. Clinical parameters, proviral DNA, host HLA genetics and measures of humoral and cellular immunity were evaluated. A <b>sieve</b> <b>effect</b> analysis was conducted comparing pre-treatment viral sequences to breakthrough viruses after STI. Our results show that a reduced proviral HIV- 1 DNA at study entry was independently associated with two virological parameters, delayed HIV- 1 RNA rebound (p = 0. 029) and lower peak viremia after treatment cessation (p = 0. 019). Reduced peak viremia was also positively correlated with a decreased number of HLA class I allele associated polymorphisms in Gag sequences in the rebounding virus population (p = 0. 012). Our findings suggest that proviral DNA levels {{and the number of}} HLA-associated Gag polymorphisms may {{have an impact on the}} clinical outcome of STI. Incorporation of these parameters in future therapeutic vaccine trials may guide refined immunogen design and help conduct safer STI approaches...|$|E

Extensive studies of the quantum sieving have been focused on nanoporous materials due to their potential applications in separating hydrogen (H 2) isotopes. This article reviews state-of-the-art research activities in the field of separation, discussing the feasibility of separating H 2   isotopes by quantum sieving in nanoporous materials including zeolites, carbons and organic framework materials. The overall results indicate that an effective separation of H 2   isotopes is possible   via combining the equilibrium and kinetic selectivity of adsorption induced by a quantum <b>sieving</b> <b>effect.</b> A fundamental understanding of the factors that affect the quantum molecular sieving is discussed. We hope to outline a clear insight into the perspectives and challenges on this novel separation technique for H 2   isotopes in the subsequent course of researches.

40|$|Oxygen binding {{properties}} {{of a recent}} class of porphyrin-based porous organic polymers (POPs) were investigated. POPs containing iron (Fe-POP) and cobalt (Co-POP) were synthesized, characterized and evaluated. Adsorption studies under ambient and cryogenic conditions (91 - 303 K) were studied. Interestingly, these POPs showed selective adsorption of O 2 over N 2 of up to 1. 3 at 273 K, and most significantly, the oxygen uptake {{was found to be}} stable and reversible over the range of temperatures studied. Furthermore, the polymers also exhibited a molecular <b>sieving</b> <b>effect,</b> which showed increasing nitrogen exclusion between 110 K and 160 K and led to an extraordinary O 2 :N 2 selectivity of up to 14. 7 at 91 K. The high oxygen loading (13 wt% at 1 atm) together with the high selectivity suggests great potential for use of these materials in hybrid adsorption-cryogenic air separation systems...|$|R
40|$|Small-angle neutron {{scattering}} (SANS) has been performed on fresh and deactivated {{fluid catalytic cracking}} (FCC) equilibrium catalysts. The catalysts were coked using a vacuum gas oil feed and stripped for varying periods of time in standard microactivity test (MAT) and fluidized-bed reactors. BET surface areas and contrast-matching SANS were measured on these samples to elucidate the influence of coke on the catalyst porosity. It was found that significant contrast matching could be obtained by mixing the catalyst with deuterated methanol, and there was good agreement between the gas adsorption and SANS results {{in terms of the}} mesoporosity. SANS indicated that the level of closed porosity is negligible in the fresh catalyst but significant in the deactivated catalysts and that the level decreases as the total coke content is reduced during stripping. Furthermore, the use of d-dodecane demonstrated that SANS can also provide information about <b>sieving</b> <b>effects</b> caused by the catalyst structure...|$|R
