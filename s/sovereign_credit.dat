25|$|<b>Sovereign</b> <b>credit</b> ratings {{represent}} an assessment by a rating agency of a sovereign's ability {{and willingness to}} repay its debt. The rating methodologies used to assess <b>sovereign</b> <b>credit</b> ratings are broadly {{similar to those used}} for corporate credit ratings, although the borrower's willingness to repay receives extra emphasis since national governments may be eligible for debt immunity under international law, thus complicating repayment obligations. In addition, credit assessments reflect not only the long-term perceived default risk, but also short- or immediate-term political and economic developments. Differences in sovereign ratings between agencies may reflect varying qualitative evaluations of the investment environment.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the process of {{economic}} globalisation is to remain partial, because of its continued reliance upon the national institutions in charge of the definition and enforcement of private property rights. Emerging economies often face critical enforcement problems, but the experience of the European Single Market also suggests that, in this respect, institutional convergence remains extremely slow. Second, the globalisation process since 1990 has seen a sharp growth in private inter-temporal contracts, exemplified by private financial transactions and by contracting on intellectual property rights; both are much more vulnerable to local institutional failures than trade in tangible goods and <b>sovereign</b> <b>credits,</b> which were the hallmark of previous phases of international liberalisation. Thus the 'frontier' of globalisation now makes markets more exposed to the underlying fragmentation of national property institution than before. This suggests that multilateral negotiation, as an instrument for the coordination of State institutions, will remain the backbone of international economic integration...|$|R

Moreover, we find that deviations from this equilibrium relationship are adjusted through the banking sector. Finally, impulse response functions show that it is possible to distinguish between a permanent sovereign shock and a transitory banking shock...|$|R
25|$|On 1 August 2012, France {{introduced}} a financial transaction tax in French tax regulation pursuant to Article 5 of the French Amended Finance Bill of 14 March 2012. Two other taxes applicable to financial transactions were also introduced, including {{a tax on}} high-frequency trading, (Article 235 ter ZD bis of the FTC); and a tax on naked <b>sovereign</b> <b>credit</b> default swaps (Article 235 ter ZD ter of the FTC). The FTT levies a 0.2% tax on stock purchases of French publicly traded companies with a market value over €1 billion. The scheme does not include debt securities, except convertible and exchangeable bonds, which are included but benefit from a dedicated exemption to the FTT. According to French president Francois Hollande the tax will generate €170 million in additional revenue for 2012 and another €500 million in 2013. France is the first European country to impose a transaction tax on share purchases. From 2 January 2017 settlement date the rate increased to 0.3%.|$|E

40|$|The recent European sovereign-debt {{crisis has}} made it clear that {{exposures}} towards <b>sovereigns</b> contain <b>credit</b> risk. However, according to the Basel frame-work’s standardized approach banks are not required to hold any regulatory cap-ital for highly rated sovereigns. In response, this thesis develops a shadow rating approach model for sovereign probability of default estimation, subsequently determining economic capital for sovereign exposures within a foundation in-ternal ratings-based framework. Furthermore, the empirical Bayes estimator is utilized for low-default portfolio probability of default calibration. The model is tested on five homogeneous sub-segments in addition to the entire dataset at hand. Empirical findings suggest that the full dataset performs adequately overall. Nonetheless, model performance is superior for accurately constructed sub-segments.

40|$|At {{the end of}} 2009, {{countries}} in the Eurozone (euro area) began to experience a sudden divergence of bond yields as the market perception of sovereign default risk increased. The theory of complete markets suggests that <b>sovereign</b> debt and <b>credit</b> default swap (CDS) credit spreads should track each other closely. In addition, liquidity risk should be priced into both instruments {{in such a way}} that buying exposure to the same default risk is identically priced. We use a time-varying vector autoregression framework to establish the credit and liquidity spread interactions over the 2009 - 2010 crisis period. We find substantial variation in the patterns of the transmission effect between maturities and across countries. Our major result is that, for several countries, including Greece, Ireland and Portugal the liquidity of the sovereign CDS market has a substantial time varying influence on <b>sovereign</b> bond <b>credit</b> spreads.

While emerging economies often face critical enforcement problems, the experience the European Single Market suggests that, in this domain, the convergence between nations remains very slow and difficult.

Thus the “frontier ” of globalisation now makes markets more exposed to the underlying fragmentation of the world economy. The parallel example of the bankruptcy law and framework for the re-negotiation of sovereign debts are discussed in some details. The conclusion is that “sub-legal ” or jurisprudential strategies – such as the Dispute Settlement Mechanism at the WTO –clearly respond to some pressing issues, but that they only perform well if they rest on the strong guarantee offered by the agreement between sovereigns. This is why globalisation will remain partial for some times...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{employs a}} {{time-varying}} parameter state space model {{to explore the}} impact of the crisis on bank retail rates in the euro area. We show that s-convergence in interest rates has been adversely affected by the crisis and quantify the role of <b>sovereign</b> and <b>credit</b> risk as two alternative explanations for the increase in financial fragmentation. A key finding is that the heterogeneity in sovereign risk across member states accounts for a sizable part of the increase in the cross-sectional dispersion of various lending and deposit rates. In contrast, {{the impact of the}} increased heterogeneity in credit risk on bank retail rates is negligible. Our results suggest that efforts to reduce sovereign tensions – as exemplified by the ECB's OMT program - may help to reduce financial fragmentation. We compare the impact of <b>sovereign</b> and <b>credit</b> risk measures on bank retail rates in the euro area during the crisis. To this end we use a time-varying parameter state space model.

40|$|Conventional wisdom says that, in {{the absence}} of su ¢ cient default penalties, <b>sovereign</b> risk {{constraints}} <b>credit</b> and lowers welfare. We show that this conventional wisdom rests on one implicit assumption: that assets cannot be retraded in secondary markets. Once this assumption is relaxed, there is always an equilibrium in which sovereign risk is stripped of its conventional e¤ects. In such an equilibrium, foreigners hold domestic debts and resell them to domestic residents before enforcement. In the presence of (even arbitrarily small) default penalties, this equilibrium is shown to be unique. As a result, sovereign risk neither constrains welfare nor lowers credit. At most, it creates some additional trade in secondary markets. The results presented here suggest a change in perspective regarding the origins of sovereign risk and its remedies. To argue that <b>sovereign</b> risk constrains <b>credit,</b> one must show both the insu ¢ ciency of default penalties and the imperfect workings of secondary markets. To relax credit constraints created by sovereign risk, one can either increase default penalties or improve the workings of secondary markets...|$|R
