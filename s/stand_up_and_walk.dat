5|$|Sheila {{was found}} {{on the floor of the}} master bedroom with her mother. She was in her nightdress, her feet were bare, and she had two bullet wounds under her chin, one of them on her throat. The pathologist, Dr Peter Vanezis, said that the lower of the {{injuries}} had occurred from three inches (76mm) away, and that the higher one was a contact injury. The higher of the two would have killed her immediately. The lower injury would have killed her too, he said, but not necessarily straight away. Vanezis testified that it would be possible for a person with such an injury to <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> around, but the lack of blood on her nightdress suggested to him that she had not done this. He believed that the lower of her injuries had happened first, because it had caused bleeding inside the neck; the court heard that if the immediately fatal wound had happened first, the bleeding would not have occurred to the same extent. Vanesiz said that the pattern of bloodstains on her nightdress suggested she had been sitting up when she received both injuries.|$|E

500|$|An inter-title {{confirms}} Helen's {{death by}} announcing {{the parents have}} gone on [...] "a visit to their lost darling". The scene cuts to a grassy cemetery with lines of tombstones separated by a loose line of two trees. Helen's parents approach her grave, marked {{by a group of}} flowers and a temporary marker at the head. Shep follows behind and pauses by a tree as Helen's parents kneel and pause to grieve. The camera cuts to Shep, who appears sad with his eyes only half open. After the parents finish grieving, they <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> to the stage left. Shep stays under the tree for a moment before approaching the grave. Through an overheard split, Shep is shown to be reminiscing about the party. The next scene shows Shep back home, lying on his side in apparent despair. His master tries to get Shep to eat some food, but the Collie refuses and turns on his side. His master pets him, confused as to what has his pet troubled so, but he gives up and departs.|$|E

60|$|Thus it was, I suppose, that I came {{to inherit}} a roving disposition. Soon after I was born, my father, being old, retired from a {{seafaring}} life, purchased a small cottage in a fishing {{village on the}} west coast of England, and settled down to spend the evening of his life on the shores of that sea which had for so many years been his home. It was not long after this that I began to show the roving spirit that dwelt within me. For some time past my infant legs had been gaining strength, so that I came to be dissatisfied with rubbing the skin off my chubby knees by walking on them, and made many attempts to <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> like a man--all of which attempts, however, resulted in my sitting down violently and in sudden surprise. One day I took advantage of my dear mother's absence to make another effort; and, to my joy, I actually succeeded in reaching the doorstep, over which I tumbled into a pool of muddy water that lay before my father's cottage door. Ah, how vividly I remember the horror of my poor mother when she found me sweltering in the mud amongst a group of cackling ducks, and the tenderness with which she stripped off my dripping clothes and washed my dirty little body! From this time forth my rambles became more frequent and, as I grew older, more distant, until at last I had wandered far and near on the shore and in the woods around our humble dwelling, and did not rest content until my father bound me apprentice to a coasting-vessel and let me go to sea.|$|E

25|$|According to Simplicius, Diogenes the Cynic {{said nothing}} upon hearing Zeno's arguments, but <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked,</b> {{in order to}} {{demonstrate}} the falsity of Zeno's conclusions. To fully solve any of the paradoxes, however, one needs to show {{what is wrong with}} the argument, not just the conclusions. Through history, several solutions have been proposed, among the earliest recorded being those of Aristotle and Archimedes.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "stand up" [...] finish is for {{the more}} debonair player who wishes to finish in style. When {{requiring}} a number to finish that is possible from one dice throw, the player can state [...] "stand up finish", throw his dice, <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> {{away from the game}} without looking at the resulting throw {{in the hope that the}} correct number has appeared and he has won.

The police arrive, and as they rush over to apprehend Liu, Ma—or his hallucination—is shown to suddenly <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> away with his recovered gun, apparently unhurt and laughing (or perhaps crying) at finding his lost weapon. The film ends with a freeze frame.|$|E

50|$|This {{novel was}} dramatized for {{television}} in 1954 for the anthology series Climax!, with Dick Powell playing Marlowe, {{as he had}} a decade earlier in the film Murder, My Sweet.

50|$|The body {{painting}} {{is in full}} course. Jennifer poses second and Joanne is very respectful and kind and creates an atmosphere so the girls forget they have nothing on except color on their body. Jennifer gets really cold and her feet and legs go numb. After the shoot she can barely <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walk,</b> that's how bad her legs hurt. Bruce has to hold her so she can stand. Nobody noticed this during the shoot and Heidi is absolutely impressed and praises Jennifer for being so professional and not complaining at all. While Joanne is applying color to Yvonne's body, Lena arrives at the Studio. She took all night to make her decision and eventually agrees to do it. Heidi respects Lena for not taking her clothes off immediately, but thinking it through {{and making sure that}} she feels comfortable with the people on the set.|$|E

5000|$|I had polio, and I {{was totally}} paralyzed, and the {{inflammation}} {{was so great}} that I had a sensory paralysis too. I could move my eyes and my hearing was undisturbed. I got very lonesome lying in bed, unable to move anything except my eyeballs. I was quarantined on the farm with seven sisters, one brother, two parents, and a practical nurse. And how could I entertain myself? I started watching people and my environment. I soon learned that my sisters could say [...] "no" [...] when they meant [...] "yes." [...] And they could say [...] "yes" [...] and mean [...] "no" [...] at the same time. They could offer another sister an apple and hold it back. And I began studying nonverbal language and body language.I had a baby sister who had begun to learn to creep.

50|$|The {{song was}} never {{performed}} on television. It was performed during the 2009 tour Mylène Farmer en tournée, as sixteenth {{song of the}} show.

The song {{was accompanied by a}} choreography: Farmer appeared standing on a cockroach-shaped chair, while the dancers performed a dynamic modern choreography; she then <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> to a platform which then raised in the airs.|$|R

50|$|Sheila {{was found}} {{on the floor of the}} master bedroom with her mother. She was in her nightdress, her feet were bare, and she had two bullet wounds under her chin, one of them on her throat.

5000|$|The playing {{styles and}} {{techniques}} that work {{best on the}} Zendrum are quite {{different from those of}} a traditional acoustic drum. Traditional drumming (especially for a drum kit) requires a certain amount of [...] "limb independence," [...] whereas the Zendrum requires more [...] "finger independence." [...] Also, traditional drumming is more than just triggering sounds; a drummer playing a physical kit gets important feedback in the way his or her sticks bounce and react from the surfaces of the drums and cymbals. Depending on the technology and style of the MIDI drum kit, a player has varying levels of feedback similar to a traditional drum kit. The Zendrum (with the exception of the Mallet pro series) requires a playing technique similar to tapping one's fingers on a table, except that the Zendrum triggers are sensitive to velocity. The majority of the Zendrum models are designed to be worn like a guitar, allowing the player to <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> around using either wired or wireless MIDI connections. Where a traditional drum kit can is typically played with 2 hands and 2 feet, the Zendrum can be triggered with all ten fingers and the palms of both hands much like a conga or other hand percussion instrument.|$|E
5000|$|The {{observed}} {{phenomena of}} lifelike qualities after {{death is not}} a new concept. In René Descartes' Discourse on the Methods he notes that decapitated animals move and display characteristics of a living body a few seconds after decapitation which was published in 1637. This continued into the French Revolution where it was observed that people who had been beheaded showed movements in facial muscles and hearts could continue to beat for almost an hour past the time of beheading. The guillotine in some cases did not completely sever head from body. In 1875 an examiner named Pierre Jean Cabanis was assigned the duty of making sure a body was truly dead. There were also stories involving beheadings where the victims would <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> around before falling dead. The ambiguity around brain death and true death has followed it to present day. In an effort to clarify some of these gray areas, the Harvard Medical Committee developed criteria for identifying a body as dead in 1968. These criteria required patients to be completely unaware and unresponsive to external stimuli, have no spontaneous muscle movements, and exhibit no reflexive response even when manipulated. They also required that an electroencephalography (EEG) show no signs of activity. The purpose of this report was to encourage physicians to distinguish brain death and irreversible coma from a persistent vegetative state where the patient still has some awareness and cycles through sleep and wakefulness ...|$|E

The Sergeant at Arms escorted Bennett out of the chamber. Deputy Speaker Edna Madzongwe ejected Nelson Chamisa and Willias Madzimure for their involvement in the fight.|$|R
