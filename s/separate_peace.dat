5|$|Henry's {{complicated}} marital {{situation and}} his high-handed {{dissolution of the}} monasteries angered the Pope and Catholic rulers throughout Europe, which increased England's diplomatic isolation. In 1544 Henry had agreed to attack France together with Emperor CharlesV, and English forces captured Boulogne at great cost in September, but soon England {{was left in the}} lurch after Charles had achieved his objectives and brokered a <b>separate</b> <b>peace.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the Allied {{invasion}} of Sicily (July 1943) and the strategic Soviet {{victory in the}} Battle of Kursk (July–August 1943), Goebbels began {{to recognize that the}} war could no longer be won. Following the Allied {{invasion of}} Italy and the fall of Mussolini in September, he raised with Hitler the possibility of a <b>separate</b> <b>peace,</b> either with the Soviets or with Britain. Hitler rejected both of these proposals.|$|E
50|$|The peasant {{movement}} ultimately failed, with {{cities and}} nobles making <b>separate</b> <b>peaces</b> with the princely armies that restored {{the old order}} in a frequently still-harsher incarnation under the nominal overlordship of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, represented in German affairs by his younger brother Ferdinand.|$|R
50|$|The French Revolutionary Wars {{continued}} from 1795, {{with the}} French {{in an increasingly}} strong position {{as members of the}} First Coalition made <b>separate</b> <b>peaces.</b> Austria and Great Britain were the main remaining members of the coalition.

50|$|The {{war with}} Głogów began again in 1321. This time, however, Henry wasn't {{convinced}} {{as to the}} appropriateness of it, and in 1322 he signed a <b>separated</b> <b>peace</b> with the Głogów Dukes, receiving in return Smogorzew. The agreement was reinforced with the marriage of Henry's eldest daughter Elisabeth to Duke Konrad I of Oleśnica.|$|R
5|$|Against this {{background}} the negotiations for the Treaty of Amiens started in October 1801. The minor {{participants in the}} negotiations between Great Britain and France (the Batavian Republic and Spain) were immediately presented with faits accomplis: the preliminary agreement ceded Ceylon, and guaranteed free English shipping to the Cape of Good Hope, without the Dutch even being consulted. The Dutch ambassador in France, Schimmelpenninck, who acted as the Dutch plenipotentiary, vainly protested that the Treaty of The Hague had guaranteed the Dutch colonies, and that France had promised {{not to make a}} <b>separate</b> <b>peace.</b> After this <b>separate</b> <b>peace</b> had been concluded, the British were left to negotiate with the minor French allies separately. This did not mean that the Dutch were completely left to their own devices: whenever French interests seemed to be in danger, France decisively intervened on its own behalf, as in the attempt to deduct the value of the Dutch fleet, surrendered in 1799, that the British had purchased from the Stadtholder, from the indemnification of the Prince of Orange.|$|E
5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1917, the War was {{dragging}} on towards its fourth year, and Zita's brother Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma, a serving officer in the Belgian Army, was a main mover behind a plan for Austria-Hungary to make a <b>separate</b> <b>peace</b> with France. Charles initiated contact with Sixtus through contacts in neutral Switzerland, and Zita wrote a letter inviting him to Vienna. Zita's mother Maria Antonia delivered the letter in person.|$|E
5|$|The Greater Poland-Pomerania {{alliance}} {{ended up}} in regaining the fortresses in Gdańsk and the complete expulsion of the Brandenburg forces from Pomerania. Although soon after Mestwin II decided to conclude a <b>separate</b> <b>peace</b> with the Margraviate, the alliance with Greater Poland signed in 1272 remained in force. The continuous threat of Brandenburg and {{the uncertainty of the}} alliance with Mestwin II, caused that Bolesław the Pious began to seek new allies in case of war. For this purpose, Bolesław decided to seek an agreement with Duke Barnim I of Pomerania.|$|E

50|$|The {{entry of}} Burgundy and Bar {{into the war}} began to turn the tide against the rebels. With the aid of Odo III of Burgundy and Count Henry II of Bar, Countess-Regent Blanche rode with her army to Lorraine's capital of Nancy in 1218 and burned the town. Blanche then joined with Emperor Frederick II to besiege the castle of Amance. Duke Theobald I of Lorraine {{surrendered}} Amance {{by the end of}} May 1218, and officially renewed his fidelity to Blanche on June 1, at which point the rebellion largely collapsed and rebel barons started making their own <b>separate</b> <b>peaces.</b>|$|R
5|$|Considering the {{response}} to be unsatisfactory, de Gaulle began constructing an independent defence force for his country. He wanted to give France, {{in the event of}} an East German incursion into West Germany, the option of coming to a <b>separate</b> <b>peace</b> with the Eastern bloc instead of being drawn into a larger NATO–Warsaw Pact war. In February 1959, France withdrew its Mediterranean Fleet from NATO command, and later banned the stationing of foreign nuclear weapons on French soil. This caused the United States to transfer two hundred military aircraft out of France and return control of the air force bases that it had operated in France since 1950 to the French by 1967.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, {{several former}} Seara {{contributors}} silenced their {{criticism of the}} Entente {{throughout the rest of}} the war. Nicolae Petrescu Găină made some contributions to the Entente's propaganda effort during the second half of 1916. He was captured by the Germans in Bucharest, allegedly after being turned over to them by Bogdan-Pitești. Avram Steuerman-Rodion was drafted into the Romanian Land Forces as a medic, earning distinction, but returned to Germanophile journalism after Romania sealed the <b>separate</b> <b>peace</b> of 1918; the victim of clinical depression, he committed suicide in autumn. An Order of the Star of Romania for his work as a military physician, Călin died of typhus in early 1917. Aderca too saw action on the front, and preserved his socialist-inspired neutralism—it later surfaced in his various fiction writings.|$|E
5|$|The French Revolution of 1789, {{in which}} the French monarchy had been overthrown, worried many British landowners. France {{declared}} war on Great Britain in 1793; in the war attempt, George allowed Pitt to increase taxes, raise armies, and suspend the right of habeas corpus. The First Coalition to oppose revolutionary France, which included Austria, Prussia, and Spain, broke up in 1795 when Prussia and Spain made <b>separate</b> <b>peace</b> with France. The Second Coalition, which included Austria, Russia, and the Ottoman Empire, was defeated in 1800. Only Great Britain was left fighting Napoleon Bonaparte, the First Consul of the French Republic.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of potential territorial adjustments, such as Banat, the Hungarian-Romanian border and Italy's claims to French territory, {{was not to}} be dealt with the Act of the Confederation, but was to be issued in <b>separate</b> final <b>peace</b> settlements.|$|R
5000|$|By 1218, {{however, the}} tide had turned, as Blanche secured papal excommunications against the rebel lords, and gained {{the support of}} the {{neighboring}} duke of Burgundy and count of Bar. Further, Blanche allied with Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II to counterbalance Duke Theobald I of Lorraine. By May 1218 Blanche and her army rode with Frederick II's forces to Lorraine's capital of Nancy and burned it to the ground. By June 1218, the rebellion had largely collapsed and individual lords began to make their own <b>separate</b> <b>peaces.</b> Erard and Philippa established a truce agreement in July 1218, which ultimately lasted the rest of Blanche's regency until 1222, during which time other rebel lords continued to haggle for better peace terms.|$|R

5|$|The neutral trading {{powers were}} {{still trying to}} arrange a peace. At Elateia, Philip had met with the same would-be peacemakers from Egypt and Rhodes who {{had been at the}} meeting in Heraclea, and again in the spring of 207 BC, but to no avail. Representatives of Egypt, Rhodes, Byzantium, Chios, Mytilene and perhaps Athens also met again with the Aetolians that spring. The war was going Philip's way, but the Aetolians, {{although}} now abandoned by both Pergamon and Rome, were not yet ready to make peace on Philip's terms. However, after another season's fighting, they finally relented. In 206 BC, the Aetolians, without Rome's consent, sued for a <b>separate</b> <b>peace</b> on conditions imposed by Philip.|$|E
5|$|The {{occupation}} of Bačka and Baranja lasted until 1944. Fearing that Hungary might conclude a <b>separate</b> <b>peace</b> with the Allies, Hitler launched Operation Margarethe I on 15 March 1944, and ordered German troops to occupy Hungary. In the meantime, {{some of those}} that had escaped prosecution for the 1942 massacres had joined various German military and police organisations. Feketehalmy-Czeydner had become the highest-ranking foreign officer in the Allgemeine SS, being promoted to SS-Obergruppenführer (lieutenant general). Grassy became a SS-Gruppenführer und Generalleutnant der Waffen-SS (major general) and was appointed to command the 25th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Hunyadi (1st Hungarian), and Zöldi joined the Gestapo. The case against them was re-opened after the German occupation, and in this second trial they were all found not guilty.|$|E
5|$|The war, the {{pre-eminent}} {{episode of}} Sultan Selim II's reign, {{began with the}} Ottoman invasion of the Venetian-held island of Cyprus. The capital Nicosia and several other towns fell quickly to the considerably superior Ottoman army, leaving only Famagusta in Venetian hands. Christian reinforcements were delayed, and Famagusta eventually fell in August 1571 after a siege of 11 months. Two months later, at the Battle of Lepanto, the united Christian fleet destroyed the Ottoman fleet, {{but was unable to}} take advantage of this victory. The Ottomans quickly rebuilt their naval forces, and Venice was forced to negotiate a <b>separate</b> <b>peace,</b> ceding Cyprus to the Ottomans and paying a tribute of 300,000 ducats.|$|E
50|$|The Rat {{was held}} {{responsible}} for provoking the Iroquois {{to a point where}} it was impossible to appease them, as exemplified by the sacking of Lachine during the summer of 1689. The Iroquois, in retaliation to the French, burned, killed, and sacked plantations which left the Island of Montreal in a state of utmost dismay. However, Kondiaronk continued to prevent a <b>separate</b> French-Iroquois <b>peace</b> by any means possible despite the aggressiveness of the warrior nation, the Iroquois.|$|R
50|$|In 1203, William Malaspina, {{a cousin}} of William of Cagliari, tried to marry the {{daughter}} of Barisone II of Gallura. This attempt to control the Galluran judgeship was nixed by the pope. In 1205, Lamberto Visconti married her. By a treaty confirmed in 1211, Comita allied with Genoa to conquere the whole island and bring under their control. There were to be no <b>separate</b> <b>peaces.</b> Together they invaded Gallura, now ruled by Lamberto. After that, {{with the support of}} Innocent, they invaded Arborea, an invasion which ended in the partition of the realm: half going to Barisone III, son of Peter I, and a quarter each going to Comita and William of Cagliari. The 1212 campaign was interrupted by Pisan repercussions and in 1214, William died. Lamberto and Ubaldo I Visconti took the opportunity that year to launch an offensive at Gallura, Cagliari, and Arborea, but were beaten off by Comita and Genoa. The war continued at sea, but was arrested by the entreaties of Pope Honorius III, who forced Comita {{to come to terms with}} Pisa (1 December 1217). Comita died sometime the next year, when his successor appears first as giudice on 10 November 1218.|$|R
50|$|In 1973, in {{response}} to world-wide aircraft hijacking concerns, a <b>separate</b> organization of <b>peace</b> officers was created, with responsibility to provide armed presence at passenger screening stations.

5|$|In March 1918, as the Bolshevik {{government}} {{concluded a}} <b>separate</b> <b>peace</b> with the Central Powers, the Germans occupied the Donbas and Khrushchev fled to Kalinovka. In late 1918 or early 1919 he was mobilized into the Red Army {{as a political}} commissar. The post of political commissar had recently been introduced as the Bolsheviks came to rely less on worker activists and more on military recruits; its functions included indoctrination of recruits in the tenets of Bolshevism, and promoting troop morale and battle readiness. Beginning as commissar to a construction platoon, Khrushchev rose to become commissar to a construction battalion and was sent from the front for a two-month political course. The young commissar came under fire many times, though many of the war stories he would tell in later life dealt more with his (and his troops') cultural awkwardness, rather than with combat. In 1921, the civil war ended, and Khrushchev was demobilized and assigned as commissar to a labor brigade in the Donbas, {{where he and his}} men lived in poor conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{third group}} {{was made up}} of tribes of the Ohio Country: Delawares (Lenape), Shawnee, Wyandot, and Mingo. These people had {{migrated}} to the Ohio valley earlier in the century from the mid-Atlantic and other eastern areas in order to escape British, French, and Iroquois domination in the New York and Pennsylvania area. Unlike the Great Lakes and Illinois Country tribes, Ohio Native Americans had no great attachment to the French regime. They had fought as French allies in the previous war in an effort to drive away the British. They made a <b>separate</b> <b>peace</b> with the British with the understanding that the British Army would withdraw from the Ohio Country. But after the departure of the French, the British strengthened their forts in the region rather than abandoning them, and so the Ohioans went to war in 1763 in another attempt to drive out the British.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the fall}} of Nicosia, the {{fortress}} of Kyrenia in the north surrendered without resistance, and on 15 September, the Turkish cavalry appeared before the last Venetian stronghold, Famagusta. At this point already, overall Venetian losses (including the local population) were estimated by contemporaries at 56,000 killed or taken prisoner. The Venetian defenders of Famagusta numbered about 8,500 men with 90 artillery pieces and were commanded by Marco Antonio Bragadin. They would hold out for 11 months against a force that would come to number 200,000 men, with 145 guns, providing the time needed by the Pope to cobble together an anti-Ottoman league from the reluctant Christian European states. The Ottomans set up their guns on 1 September. Over the following months, they proceeded to dig a huge network of criss-crossing trenches for a depth of three miles around the fortress, which provided shelter for the Ottoman troops. As the siege trenches neared the fortress and came within artillery range of the walls, ten forts of timber and packed earth and bales of cotton were erected. The Ottomans however lacked the naval strength to completely blockade the city from sea as well, and the Venetians were able to resupply it and bring in reinforcements. After news of such a resupply in January reached the Sultan, he recalled Piyale Pasha and left Lala Mustafa alone {{in charge of the}} siege. At the same time, an initiative by Sokollu Mehmed Pasha to achieve a <b>separate</b> <b>peace</b> with Venice, foundered. The Grand Vizier offered to concede a trading station at Famagusta if the Republic would cede the island, but the Venetians, encouraged by their recent capture of Durazzo in Albania and the ongoing negotiations for the formation of a Christian league (see below), refused. Thus on 12 May 1571, the intensive bombardment of Famagusta's fortifications began, and on 1 August, with ammunition and supplies exhausted, the garrison surrendered the city. The Siege of Famagusta cost the Ottomans some 50,000 casualties. The Ottomans allowed the Christian residents and surviving Venetian soldiers to leave Famagusta peacefully but when Lala Mustafa learned that some Muslim prisoners had been killed during the siege he had Bragadin mutilated and flayed alive, while his companions were executed. Bragadin's skin was then paraded around the island, before being sent to Constantinople.|$|E
50|$|The {{response}} by Israeli {{politicians and the}} general public to high-profile peace attempts give an indication of how these events, and therefore the peace process, have been viewed.

50|$|Since the US Senate {{refused to}} ratify the Treaty of Versailles {{following}} the First World War, the US government found itself outside of the inter-Allied arrangements made with the German government. As a result, the US government began its own process of rapprochment with Berlin. As part of that process, a <b>separate</b> US-German <b>peace</b> treaty was concluded in 1921. Following {{the conclusion of the}} peace treaty, diplomatic relations between the two governments were reestablished, and on December 10, 1921, the new US ambassador, Ellis Loring Dresel, presented his credentials in Berlin.|$|R

50|$|The Treaty of Versailles {{severely}} limited Germany's industrial output. Its army {{was restricted to}} 100,000 men and its military production was greatly reduced. However, the treaty did not diminish Germany's place {{as a leader in}} military innovation, and many industrial firms still retained the machinery and technology to produce military hardware. Therefore, to circumvent the treaty's restrictions, these industrial firms formed partnerships with foreign nations, such as the Soviet Union and Argentina, to legally produce weapons and sell them. As the Chinese government did not sign the Treaty of Versailles, a <b>separate</b> German-Chinese <b>Peace</b> Treaty was concluded in 1921.|$|R
