5|$|The spotted {{sandgrouse}} is a ground-dwelling bird and feeds on seeds and other plant material that it finds among the scrubby vegetation of its dry habitat. During the breeding season it is solitary but {{at other times}} of year it is gregarious. Flocks move into a new feeding ground after a storm has stimulated new green growth. In the Sahara the {{spotted sandgrouse}} are particularly fond of a species of spurge and concentrate on this until the foliage begins to parch, after which the birds return to their normal diet of seeds. These are abundant on the desert floor, remaining in a dormant state until rain occurs. The birds are very wary and easily frightened. Their chief enemy is the lanner falcon which flies rapidly just above the ground and <b>scoops</b> <b>up</b> any unwary bird. The sandgrouse strategy is to have one bird flying high overhead. When it sees an approaching falcon it gives a warning call and the other sandgrouse freeze. So good is their camouflage that the raptor is unable to detect them and flies on. Sandgrouse {{need to make a}} daily journey to a drinking hole, which may be many kilometres from their feeding ground. They land a short distance from the water and maintain a sentinel system here too as, beside the falcons, mammal predators may lurk nearby and nomads may water their herds. When all is safe, another distinctive call from the sentinel bird sends all the others to the pool where their daily water needs are taken up within about fifteen seconds.|$|E

In grain trade, the term {{grain elevator}} also describes a tower containing a bucket elevator or a pneumatic conveyor, which <b>scoops</b> <b>up</b> grain from {{a lower level}} and deposits it in a silo or other storage facility.|$|E
25|$|Ripburger flees in a {{semi-trailer}} truck, but as Ben and Maureen {{ride away}} he reappears and rams them. The Vultures arrive driving their flightless cargo plane, which <b>scoops</b> <b>up</b> the truck along with Ben, Maureen, and Ben's bike. The plane and truck wind up hanging precariously {{over the edge}} of Poyahoga Gorge, and Ripburger falls to his death. Maureen and the Vultures flee the plane while Ben makes it out at the last second by jumping his bike out the back cargo door just as the truck explodes and it and the plane fall into the gorge. Members of the biker gangs attend Malcolm's funeral, at which Father Torque delivers a eulogy. Maureen takes over Corley Motors, and Ben rides away into the sunset.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} {{produced}} by Falk and Yacoub, co-produced by Tuinfort and Ilya, with vocal production being done by Ilya, Kotecha and Yacoub. [...] "One Last Time" [...] is a dance-pop and EDM-light song, with a total length of three minutes and seventeen seconds (3:17). Its instrumentations consist in [...] "pummeling drums and a three-note synth line". [...] "One Last Time" [...] is written in the key of A-flat major, with a moderately fast tempo of 125 beats per minute. Grande's vocals range from F#3 to C6. Lyrically, the song is about asking a former lover to spend one last time with you, although he has already moved on and is with someone new. As noted by Jason Lipshut of Billboard, [...] "the downbeat admission of 'I know/that you got everything/But I got nothing here without you' is the pained sound of a narrator racked with guilt, the chorus sets aside that humiliation and <b>scoops</b> <b>up</b> a sense of hope," [...] with the singer pleading, [...] "One last time/I need {{to be the one}} who takes you home/One more time/I promise after that, I'll let you go". Rob Copsey of The Official Charts Company noted that the song [...] " [...] reminded him of Swedish's recording artist, Loreen's 2012 Eurovision winning song [...] "Euphoria".|$|E
500|$|The {{composition}} of the scene juxtaposes the prim and proper Huguenot man and his immaculately dressed wife and son with these three, as they form their own [...] "family group" [...] across {{the other side of}} the gutter. The head of John the Baptist on a platter is the advertisement for the pie shop, proclaiming [...] "Good eating". Below this sign are the embracing couple, extending the metaphor of good eating beyond a mere plate of food, and still further down the street girl greedily <b>scoops</b> <b>up</b> the pie, carrying the theme to the foot of the picture. I. R. F. Gordon sees the vertical line of toppling plates from the top window downwards as a symbol of the disorder on this side of the street. The man reduced to a head on the sign, in what is assumed to be the woman's fantasy, is mirrored by the [...] "Good Woman" [...] pictured on the board behind who has only a body, her nagging head removed to create the man's ideal of a [...] "good woman". In the top window of the [...] "Good Woman", a woman throws a plate with a leg of meat into the street as she argues, providing a stark contrast to the [...] "good" [...] woman pictured on the sign below. Ronald Paulson sees the kite hanging from the church as part of a trinity of signs; the kite indicating the purpose of the church, an ascent into heaven, just as the other signs for [...] "Good Eating" [...] and the [...] "Good Woman" [...] indicate the predilections of those on that side of the street; but he also notes it as another nod to the pastoral tradition: here instead of soaring above the fields it hangs impotently on the church wall.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{contemporary}} critics {{choose to}} emphasize the strong feminist elements, fast-moving story, curiously contemporary “stalker” theme, and — most of all — the conspicuous lack of domesticity (in contrast with Little Women). The Booklist reviewer declares “Alcott's melodramatic but intriguing tale dramatises the tragic plight of women in her oppressive times“, [...] while Katherine Powers of Forbes, exclaiming over the novel's unexpectedly exuberant violation of norms, recommends the audiobook version as “a real Gothic potboiler by a slumming Louisa May Alcott”. Phoebe-Lou Adams of the Atlantic Monthly, wondering why such an exciting and adjective-rich narrative was originally rejected, speculates “Could the objection have been simply that the heroine, on discovering {{that she has been}} duped into a false marriage with a murderer, fails to collapse and die of shame? Instead she <b>scoops</b> <b>up</b> the available jewels, flees by night through a window, and repudiates any guilt in the affair. Perfectly sensible of herbut perhaps not what readers of Victorian light literature were prepared to approve.” ...|$|E

60|$|Then, {{one bright}} day, a 'Power,' {{watching}} his hands, conceived {{the idea of}} giving him two balls of string, one blue, the other buff, and all that afternoon he stayed up a single tree, and came down with one of his rare sweet smiles and a little net, half blue, half buff, with a handle covered with a twist of Turkey-red twill--such a thing as one <b>scoops</b> <b>up</b> shrimps with. He was paid for it, and his eyes sparkled. You see, he had no money--the 'poilu' seldom has; and money meant drink, and tobacco in his cheek. They gave him more string, and {{for the next few days}} it rained little nets, beautifully if simply made. They thought that his salvation was in sight. It takes an eye to tell salvation from damnation, sometimes.... In any case, he no longer roamed from tree to tree, but sat across a single branch, netting. The 'Powers' began to speak of him as 'rather a dear,' for it is characteristic of human nature to take interest only in that which by some sign of progress makes you feel that you are doing good.|$|E
6000|$|... "What are {{we going}} to see?" [...] "Japanese gir--No, we aren't, by Jove! Catch that Chinaman, quick." [...] The pigtail is trying to double back across a {{courtyard}} into an inner chamber; but a large hand on his shoulder spins him round and puts him in rear of the line of advancing Englishmen, who are, be it observed, making a fair amount of noise with their boots. A second door is thrown open, and the visitors advance into a large, square room blazing with gas. Here thirteen pigtails, deaf and blind to the outer world, are bending over a table. The captured Chinaman dodges uneasily {{in the rear of the}} procession. Five--ten--fifteen seconds pass, the Englishmen standing in the full light less than three paces from the absorbed gang who see nothing. Then the burly Superintendent brings his hand down on his thigh with a crack like a pistol-shot and shouts: [...] "How do, John?" [...] Follows a frantic rush of scared Celestials, almost tumbling over each other in their anxiety to get clear. One pigtail <b>scoops</b> <b>up</b> a pile of copper money, another a chinaware soup-bowl, and only a little mound of accusing cowries remains on the white matting that covers the table. In less than half a minute two facts are forcibly brought home to the visitor. First, that a pigtail is largely composed of silk, and rasps the palm of the hand as it slides through; and secondly, that the forearm of a Chinaman is surprisingly muscular and well-developed. [...] "What's going to be done?" [...] "Nothing. There are only three of us, and all the ringleaders would get away. We've got 'em safe any time we want to catch 'em, if this little visit doesn't make 'em shift their quarters. Hi! John. No pidgin to-night. Show how you makee play. That fat youngster there is our informer." ...|$|E
