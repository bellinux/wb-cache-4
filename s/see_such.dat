5|$|Often feminist economists use country-level {{or smaller}} case studies focused on {{developing}} and often understudied countries or populations. For example, Michael Kevane and Leslie C. Gray examine how gendered social norms {{are central to}} understanding agricultural activities in Burkina Faso. Cristina Carrasco and Arantxa Rodriquez examine the care economy in Spain to suggest that women's entrance into the labor market requires more equitable caregiving responsibilities. Such studies show the importance of local social norms, government policies and cultural situations. Feminist economists <b>see</b> <b>such</b> variation as a crucial factor {{to be included in}} economics.|$|E

5|$|The short fifth {{passage is}} a {{continuation}} of the previous events and relates an exchange of courtesies between court ladies and a monk who had kept night watch telling religious and other stories. Murasaki Shikibu tells him: You cannot <b>see</b> <b>such</b> a lovely thing every day, to which he replies: Indeed! indeed! clapping his hands in joy and neglecting his Buddha. The illustration shows an elderly priest near the left border of the painting pushing open a folding screen beyond which three court ladies are seated.

5|$|In early 2008, he was {{diagnosed}} with malignant melanoma, a severe form of skin cancer. He had fought the disease before, when he had a form of skin cancer removed from his back in 2006. Cooksey suspected his cancer originated from a six-month spell coaching schoolchildren in the searing heat of Las Vegas in the United States. In April 2008, Grays Athletic staged a benefit match for Cooksey. The match consisted of former professional players, as well as current professionals such as Leroy Lita, Nicky Shorey, Aaron McLean, Ray Parlour, Justin Edinburgh, Iain Dowie, Bob Dowie, Clive Allen, Scott Fitzgerald and Paul Merson. He returned to his former club Oldham Athletic in May 2008, where another benefit match was staged for his appeal at Boundary Park, attended by 1,500 fans to <b>see</b> <b>such</b> former players as John Barnes, Luther Blissett and Chris Waddle as well as television actors from Coronation Street.|$|E

Only one Pacer (the modernised 144e) currently meets this requirement, and the remainder will therefore need to be withdrawn by that date unless they receive an extensive refurbishment.

25|$|Selling {{human waste}} {{products}} as fertilizers became much less common after World War II, both for sanitary reasons {{and because of}} the proliferation of chemical fertilizers, and less than 1% is now used for fertilization. Because of this history, Japan had a much higher historical standard of hygiene. For example, in Japan, the orderly disposal of human waste was common, while in Europe, sewage was simply dumped on the streets throughout much of the continent's early modern history.

Arguing that the AKP has a dream for a new Turkey, he claimed that anyone who did not <b>see</b> <b>such</b> a dream should be embarrassed.

25|$|A {{study by}} Peter Kuppens (2008) showed that extraverts and introverts engage in {{different}} behaviors when feeling pleasant, {{which may explain}} underestimation of the frequency and intensity of happiness exhibited by introverts. Specifically, Kuppens (2008) found that arousal and pleasantness are positively correlated for extraverts, which means that pleasant feelings {{are more likely to}} be accompanied by high arousal for extraverts. On the other hand, arousal and pleasantness are negatively correlated for introverts, resulting in introverts exhibiting low arousal when feeling pleasant. In other words, if everything is going well in an extravert's life, which is a source of pleasant feelings, extraverts <b>see</b> <b>such</b> situation as an opportunity to engage in active behavior and goal pursuit, which brings about an active, aroused pleasant state. When everything is going well for introverts, they see it as an opportunity to let down their guard, resulting in them feeling relaxed and content.|$|E

25|$|It was Neil's {{last season}} {{and it was a}} shame that his amazing career should end in an uncharacteristic {{outburst}} of bad temper against Ted Dexter. I never did {{get to the bottom of}} the row but perhaps it was just because he and Ted were total opposites as people. All I know is that his press comments on Ted lost him a lot of friends. These attacks upset the MCC players more than anything else that happened on that tour, and for Neil to retire from the game on this sour note was disappointing for those who had played with an against him, and for the public who had enjoyed his performances. For all this, you couldn't help admiring some of Neil's knocks, including his sixth Test century against England. He was nearly always exciting to watch because he was the sort of batsman who was supremely capable of winning or saving a match. He was also good to bowl to because he gave you a chance; he played shots and he took risks. And his fielding was quite brilliant; in this series, it was easily the best on either side. He stopped some wonderful shots in the covers and took some terrific catches. It was just sad to <b>see</b> <b>such</b> a talented man consumed by such bitterness.|$|E
25|$|The Colonial Route {{is mostly}} in the central {{highlands}} with {{a significant number of}} churches, monasteries and other structures from the colonial period along with some from the 19th century and even into the early 20th. The most important city on this route is San Cristóbal de las Casas, located in the Los Altos region in the Jovel Valley. The historic center of the city is filled with tiled roofs, patios with flowers, balconies, Baroque facades along with Neoclassical and Moorish designs. It is centered on a main plaza surrounded by the cathedral, the municipal palace, the Portales commercial area and the San Nicolás church. In addition, it has museums dedicated to the state’s indigenous cultures, one to amber and one to jade, both of which have been mined in the state. Other attractions along this route include Comitán de Domínguez and Chiapa de Corzo, along with small indigenous communities such as San Juan Chamula. The state capital of Tuxtla Gutiérrez does not have many colonial era structures left, but it lies near the area's most famous natural attraction of the Sumidero Canyon. This canyon is popular with tourists who take boat tours into it on the Grijalva River to <b>see</b> <b>such</b> features such as caves (La Cueva del Hombre, La Cueva del Silencio) and the Christmas Tree, which is a rock and plant formation on the side of one of the canyon walls created by a seasonal waterfall.|$|E
