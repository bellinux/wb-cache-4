50|$|At an {{estimated}} cost Rs 9.85 billion would be launched {{in order to}} meet water <b>supply</b> <b>requirement</b> of Quetta city and adjoining areas. According to sources, the Ministry of Water and Power prepared the PC-1 of the project and referred it to the Ministry of Planning, Development and Reforms. The project envisages: (i) providing about 8.10 MGD for augmenting the existing under stress water requirements of Quetta Town, (ii) shifting the existing trend of extracting underground water by means of tube wells to more sustainable option of constructing the surface water storage reservoirs, (iii) providing un-interrupted drinking water supplies to the inhabitants of Quetta Town by means of Construction of Water Storage Tanks in Quetta Valley, (iv) uplifting the livelihood of inhabitants by providing employment and business opportunities during construction phase of the project, (v) mitigating the impacts of floods D/S of proposed Dam site. According to PC-1 of the project, the federal and Balochistan governments would share the cost of the project equally. The project would be completed within 36 months after its approval.|$|E
5000|$|On 22 February 1942 General MacArthur had {{requested}} direct support from Honolulu rather than Australia {{as it was}} lacking in resources. Within a day {{a very high level}} study of the situation concluded three old ex destroyers converted into fast commercial fruit carriers, now named Masaya, Matagalpa and Teapa, and recently taken over under bare boat charter by the War Department with intentions to use them as inter-island transports would be suited to that <b>supply</b> <b>requirement.</b> Under urgent Presidential orders to support the forces in Bataan and Corregidor the Army began to prepare the ships to run the Japanese blockade of the Philippines. Cargoes were shipped to New Orleans for the three ships. They were originally due to sail on 28 February 1942 but difficulties, including securing naval gun crews [...] to put on the ships, delayed sailing. Masaya sailed on 2 March 1942, Matagalpa on 11 March and Teapa on 18 March. While the situation in the Philippines became desperate the three ships were forced to stop in Los Angeles for repair. On 13 April General MacArthur reported blockade running was [...] "useless," [...] but the War Department decided to make the attempt. The ships were reloaded with Matagalpa loaded for Mindanao and arriving in Honolulu on 8 May 1942, too late to relieve Corregidor. Matagalpa and the other ships intended for supply of the Philippines, were diverted to Australia.|$|E

40|$|Common mode voltage (CMV) {{variations}} in PWM inverter-fed drives generate unwanted shaft and bearing current resulting in early motor failure. Multilevel inverters reduce this problem to some extent, with {{higher number of}} levels.

In this paper a five-level inverter structure is proposed for open-end winding induction motor (IM) drives, by cascading only two conventional two-level and three-level inverters, with the elimination of the common mode voltage over the entire modulation range. The DC link power <b>supply</b> <b>requirement</b> is also optimized by means of DC link capacitor voltage balancing, with PWM control, using only inverter switching state redundancies.

40|$|This {{research}} {{seeks to}} evaluate the economic benefits {{to be gained by}} installing a small-scale wind turbine for a customer with a three-phase electrical <b>supply</b> <b>requirement.</b> The evidence for the claims made in this paper is obtained by using actual data obtained from the installed equipment over a three year period. The objective is to accurately appraise the financial investment using real data. There appears to be limited studies conducted into this type of research, possibly because the renewable energy sector is in the infancy stage in the host country, Ireland. There are some wind energy installations with financial appraisal techniques based on modeled data, which may, or may not, be accurate. The study concludes by claiming that the financial benefits of the wind energy turbine installation had disappointing results when compared to predicted benefits based on modeled data...|$|E
