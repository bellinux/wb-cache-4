5|$|Banksia prionotes is {{susceptible}} {{to a number of}} threatening processes. It is highly {{susceptible to}} Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback; wild populations are harvested commercially by the cut flower industry; and some of its range is subject to land clearing for urban or agricultural purposes. An assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that severe change is likely to lead to a reduction in its range of around 50% by 2080; and even mild change is projected to cause a reduction of 30%; but under mid-severity scenarios the distribution may actually grow, depending on how effectively it can migrate into newly habitable areas. However, this <b>study</b> <b>does</b> not address the potential of climate change to alter fire regimes; these have already been impacted by the arrival of humans, and this change is thought to have led to a decline in the abundance and range of B.prionotes.|$|E
25|$|Molecular phylogenetic {{studies show}} that the Echinodontiaceae belong in the Russuloid clade. Although some studies have {{suggested}} that the Echinodontium genus is closely related to Amylostereum, a more recent <b>study</b> <b>does</b> not support this conclusion.|$|E

25|$|According to Benjamin Sovacool, an {{interdisciplinary}} team from MIT in 2003 estimated {{that given the}} expected growth of nuclear power from 2005 – 2055, at least four serious nuclear accidents would be expected in that period.

25|$|When {{census data}} cannot be collected, statisticians collect data by {{developing}} specific experiment designs and survey samples. Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can reasonably extend {{from the sample}} to {{the population as a}} whole. An experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. In contrast, an observational <b>study</b> <b>does</b> not involve experimental manipulation.|$|E
30|$|For {{migraine}} prevalence, {{a higher}} prevalence {{was reported in}} previous Saudi <b>studies</b> <b>done</b> on university students of King Faisal University (58.4 %) [7] and Taibah University (61.8 %) [19]. The lower prevalence found in our study (32.5 %) {{could be explained by}} the fact that we only describe a 3 -month prevalence. In the same time, lower migraine prevalence was reported from other <b>studies</b> <b>done</b> on university students in other Arab and foreign countries [10, 21], and in a <b>study</b> <b>done</b> in KSA [17].|$|R

25|$|A {{study in}} the genetic marker of the Phoenicians led by Pierre Zalloua, showed that the Phoenician genetic marker was found in 1 out of 17 males in the region {{surrounding}} the Mediterranean and Phoenician trading centers such as the Levant, Tunisia, Morocco, Cyprus, and Malta. The study focused on the male Y-chromosome of a sample of 1,330 males from the Mediterranean. Colin Groves, biological anthropologist of the Australian National University in Canberra says that the <b>study</b> <b>does</b> not suggest that the Phoenicians were restricted to a certain place, but that their DNA still lingers 3,000 years later.|$|E
25|$|Many Lemba are {{adherents of}} Christianity. However, they have {{preserved}} some rituals and customs {{believed to be}} Jewish in origin and {{have been found to}} possess genetic traits in common with other Jewish groups, supporting their claims to ancient Jewish ancestry. Recent DNA testing on the Lemba by the South African Medical Journal (SAMJ) tested both South African Ashkenazi Jews and Lemba for the extended Cohen Model Haplogroup (CMH). Although the 24 individuals, (10 Lemba,14 SA Jews) were identified as having the original Cohen Model Haplogroup, only one South African Jew harboured the extended CMH. However, this <b>study</b> <b>does</b> not support earlier claims of their Jewish genetic heritage.|$|E
25|$|A 2008 {{computer}} {{analysis of the}} Book of Mormon text supports this theory, although the <b>study</b> <b>does</b> not include Joseph Smith in the author sample {{on the ground that}} few pure examples of Smith's writings are extant. Several other significant problems are apparent in the methodology of this {{computer analysis}}, specifically the use of closed set methodology instead of open set methodology. For example, the original methodology, when replicated, also assigns Rigdon as the probable author of The Federalist Papers, which were written five years before his birth. Critics of the Spalding–Rigdon theory point out that there is no record of any meeting between Rigdon and Smith until December 1830, nearly a year after the Book of Mormon was published.|$|E

25|$|In his book, Normal accidents, Charles Perrow {{says that}} {{multiple}} and unexpected failures are built into society's complex and tightly-coupled nuclear reactor systems. Such accidents are unavoidable and cannot be designed around. An interdisciplinary team from MIT {{has estimated that}} given the expected growth of nuclear power from 2005 – 2055, at least four serious nuclear accidents would be expected in that period. However the MIT <b>study</b> <b>does</b> {{not take into account}} improvements in safety since 1970. To date, there have been five serious accidents (core damage) in the world since 1970 (one at Three Mile Island in 1979; one at Chernobyl in 1986; and three at Fukushima-Daiichi in 2011), corresponding {{to the beginning of the}} operation of generation II reactors. This leads to on average one serious accident happening every eight years worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Ornithologists have {{traditionally}} recognized two subspecies of this bird: the American ivory-billed, the more famous of the two, and the Cuban ivory-billed woodpecker. The two look similar despite differences {{in size and}} plumage. Some controversy exists over whether the Cuban ivory-billed woodpecker is more appropriately recognized as a separate species. A recent study compared DNA samples taken from specimens of both ivory-billed birds along with the imperial woodpecker, a larger but otherwise very similar bird. It concluded {{not only that the}} Cuban and American ivory-billed woodpeckers are genetically distinct, but also that they and the imperial form a North American clade within Campephilus that appeared in the mid-Pleistocene. The <b>study</b> <b>does</b> not attempt to define a lineage linking the three birds, though it does imply that the Cuban bird is more closely related to the imperial.|$|E
25|$|Visual acuity, {{or color}} vision loss with {{concurrent}} mucocutaneous lesions or systemic Behçet's disease symptoms should raise suspicion of optic nerve involvement in Behçet's disease and prompt a work-up for Behçet's disease if not previously diagnosed {{in addition to}} an ocular work-up. Diagnosis of Behçet's disease is based on clinical findings including oral and genital ulcers, skin lesions such as erythema nodosum, acne, or folliculitis, ocular inflammatory findings and a pathergy reaction. Inflammatory markers such ESR, and CRP may be elevated. A complete ophthalmic examination may include a slit lamp examination, optical coherence tomography to detect nerve loss, visual field examinations, fundoscopic examination to assess optic disc atrophy and retinal disease, fundoscopic angiography, and visual evoked potentials, which may demonstrate increased latency. Optic nerve enhancement may be identified on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in some patients with acute optic neuropathy. However, a normal <b>study</b> <b>does</b> not rule out optic neuropathy. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis may demonstrate elevated protein level with or without pleocytosis. Imaging including angiography may be indicated to identify dural venous sinus thrombosis as a cause of intracranial hypertension and optic atrophy.|$|E

500|$|Observations {{suggest that}} the black hole in M87 may be {{displaced}} from the galaxy center by {{a distance of about}} [...] The displacement is in the opposite direction from the one-sided jet, which may indicate that the black hole was accelerated away by the jet. Another possibility is that the displacement occurred during the merger of two supermassive black holes. However care must be taken with these findings. The <b>study</b> <b>does</b> not include any spectroscopic discrimination between the stellar and active galactic nucleus components. It is therefore possible that the seeming position of the galaxy center with respect to the black hole is misinterpreted by an optical flare of the jet itself. In 2011, an analysis of M87 did not find any statistically significant displacement.|$|E
500|$|Research and <b>study</b> <b>does</b> {{not apply}} to {{commercial}} research, and does not include infringements of broadcasts, sound recordings or film; it also has only a limited application to software. These exclusions have been criticised as failing [...] "to reflect the increasing importance of non-textual media for both study and research". Research cannot be private, and in a non-academic setting must also not have a future potential commercial purpose. This exception also excludes, under Section 29(3)(b) of the 1988 Act, copying which will result in [...] "copies of substantially the same material being provided {{to more than one}} person at substantially the same time and for substantially the same purpose".

500|$|In 2011, {{graduate}} student Ryan Carney and colleagues performed the first colour study on an Archaeopteryx specimen. Using {{scanning electron microscopy}} technology and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, the team was able to detect the structure of melanosomes in the single-feather specimen described in 1861. The resultant structure was then {{compared to that of}} 87modern bird species and was determined with a highest likelihood to be black. The feather studied was most probably a single covert, which would have partly covered the primary feathers on the wings. The <b>study</b> <b>does</b> not mean that Archaeopteryx was entirely black, but suggests that it had some black colouration which included the coverts. Carney pointed out that this is consistent with what we know of modern flight characteristics, in that black melanosomes have structural properties that strengthen feathers for flight. In a 2013 study published in the Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry, new analyses of Archaeopteryxs feathers revealed that the animal may have had complex light- and dark-coloured plumage, with heavier pigmentation in the distal tips and outer vanes. In a press release, Carney argued against this interpretation, insisting the wing feather was [...] "matte black with a darker tip" [...] and one of his colleagues also brought up the subject in a review paper however, no new evidence was published.|$|E

500|$|Researchers [...] {{from the}} SENSOR-Pesticides program {{published}} an article in 2005 in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) on pesticide poisoning in schools. The article, which included data collected by SENSOR, described illnesses in students and school employees associated with pesticide exposures. [...] The study found that rates of pesticide-related illnesses in children rose significantly from 1998 to 2002 {{and called for a}} reduction in pesticide use to prevent pesticide-related illness on or near school grounds. [...] The article generated media coverage and drew attention to pesticide safety in schools and to safer alternatives to pesticides through integrated pest management (IPM). [...] "he <b>study</b> <b>does</b> provide evidence that using pesticides at schools is not innocuous and that there are better ways to use pesticides," [...] said study co-author Dr. Geoffrey Calvert. [...] Officials in organizations supporting the pesticide industry, such as CropLife America and RISE (Responsible Industry for a Sound Environment, a trade association representing pesticide manufacturers and suppliers), reacted strongly to the report, calling it “alarmist” and “incomplete” in its health reporting. CropLife America president Jay Vroom claimed that the report was “written without context about the proper use of pesticides in schools and [...] not mention the positive public health protections they provide" [...] and stated that pesticide use in schools is [...] "well regulated" [...] and can be managed so that the risk is low. [...] RISE president Allen James faulted the article for relying on unverified reports and said that evidence suggested that such incidents were extremely rare. [...] The increased awareness of pesticide use in schools influenced parents and other stakeholders in numerous states to call for the adoption of integrated pest management programs. [...] According to the National Pest Management Association, three more states passed IPM rules or laws between October 2005 and October 2008.|$|E
