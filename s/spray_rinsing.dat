This process {{involves}} applying a solution (such as a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and water) onto the areas affected by stains, <b>spray</b> <b>rinsing</b> the print in order to rinse off the solution, and then blotting it dry. [...] Many processes for removing stains could be highly detrimental to the paper, the pigment, or both. Water washing techniques such as immersion, floating, or suction table may cause the ink to run. Some organic colorants may even dissolve when exposed to water.|$|E

Dust contamination {{is known to}} be a significant source of such defects. Measurements of dust density were made at SACLAY on well characterized surfaces during various steps of a standard cavity preparation process.

There is no dismounting between steps, and the process is fully automatized, with no human intervention.

40|$|The {{effect of}} various HF-based etching {{processes}} on the laser damage resistance of scratched fused silica surfaces has been investigated. Conventionally polished and subsequently scratched fused silica plates were treated by submerging in various HF-based etchants (HF or NH{sub 4 }F:HF at various ratios and concentrations) under different process conditions (e. g., agitation frequencies, etch times, rinse conditions, and environmental cleanliness). Subsequently, the laser damage resistance (at 351 or 355 nm) of the treated surface was measured. The laser damage resistance {{was found to}} be strongly process dependent and scaled inversely with scratch width. The etching process was optimized to remove or prevent the presence of identified precursors (chemical impurities, fracture surfaces, and silica-based redeposit) known to lead to laser damage initiation. The redeposit precursor was reduced (and hence the damage threshold was increased) by: (1) increasing the SiF{sub 6 }{sup 2 -} solubility through reduction in the NH 4 F concentration and impurity cation impurities, and (2) improving the mass transport of reaction product (SiF{sub 6 }{sup 2 -}) (using high frequency ultrasonic agitation and excessive <b>spray</b> <b>rinsing)</b> away from the etched surface. A 2 D finite element crack-etching and rinsing mass transport model (incorporating diffusion and advection) was used to predict reaction product concentration. The predictions are consistent with the experimentally observed process trends. The laser damage thresholds also increased with etched amount (up to {approx} 30 {micro}m), which has been attributed to: (1) etching through lateral cracks where there is poor acid penetration, and (2) increasing the crack opening resulting in increased mass transport rates. With the optimized etch process, laser damage resistance increased dramatically; the average threshold fluence for damage initiation for 30 {micro}m wide scratches increased from 7 to 41 J/cm{sup 2 }, and the statistical probability of damage initiation at 12 J/cm{sup 2 } of an ensemble of scratches decreased from {approx} 100 mm{sup - 1 } of scratch length to {approx} 0. 001 mm{sup - 1 }...|$|E

40|$|Two {{cleaning}} processes, one aqueous and one nonaqueous, {{were investigated}} as potential replacements for the vapor degreasing process using 1, 1, 1 trichloroethane (TCA) for hybrid microcircuit assemblies. The aqueous process {{was based upon}} saponification chemistry. A 10 % solution of either Kester 5768 or Armakleen 2001, heated to 140 F, was sprayed on the hybrid at 450 psig and a flow rate of 5 gpm through a specially designed nozzle which created microdroplets. The nonaqueous process was based upon dissolution chemistry and used d-limonene as the solvent in an immersion and spray process. The d-limonene solvent was followed by an isopropyl alcohol <b>spray</b> <b>rinse</b> to remove the excess d-limonene. The aqueous microdroplet process {{was found to be}} successful only for solder reflow profiles that did not exceed 210 C. Furthermore, removal of component marking was a problem and the spray pressure had to be reduced to 130 psig to eliminate damage to capacitor end caps. The d-limonene cleaning was found to be successful for solder reflow temperature up to 250 C when using a four-step cleaning process. The four steps included refluxing the hybrid at 80 C, followed by soaking the hybrid in d-limonene which is heated to 80 C, followed by spray cleaning at 80 psig with room temperature d-limonene, followed by spray cleaning at 80 psig with room temperature IPA was developed to remove residual flux from the hybrid microcircuits.

40|$|For {{the vapor}} {{phase of the}} WVN process the 160 to 190 {sup 0 }F {{temperature}} limit is shown to be well within the 145 to 208 {sup 0 }F minimum/maximum range.

The most productive area for improvement would be an increase in the water vapor concentration above the present 5 % level. However, this would require confirmatory testing before approved use. The rinsing process was shown to be mainly controlled by component crevice geometry. Improvements in rinse time may be made by increasing the water temperature, but the concern over the caustic stress corrosion cracking will tend to limit the available increase. Although directed jets or <b>sprays</b> of <b>rinse</b> flows was not recommended, methods were suggested for conserving rinse water.

40|$|Improving the {{efficiency}} of a Pre- <b>Rinse</b> <b>Spray</b> Valve (PRSV) {{is one of the}} most cost effective water conservation methods in the Food Services Industry. A significant contributor to this cost efficiency is the reduction in the energy costs required to provide the mandatory hot water. This research paper estimates the potential quantity and dollar value of the water and energy that can be saved annually in Texas A&M University's dining services with the installation of low flow pre-rinse spray valves. The data collection was obtained from four of Texas A&M University's Dining Services facilities. The annual savings were estimated by contrasting the water consumption of the existing T & S Brass B 0107 -M PRSVs with the latest and most advanced available low flow T and S Brass B 0107 -C PRSV. The annual water consumption of the existing and new PRSVs were predicted by measuring an individual average flow rate for each and observing the number of hours per day the PRSV would be used. The observed and measured values were extrapolated to amount rates to determine cost savings. The dollar value was ascertained using the utility cost data recorded over a semester by the Facilities Coordinator of the Department of Dining Services. The findings of this study show that the water savings from a single PRSV could lead to an estimated annual saving ranging between 46 % and 78 % of the current operation cost. The T & S Brass B 0107 -C PRSV is currently priced between $ 52 - $ 60 per valve resulting in a payback period ranging between 1. 5 - 6 months per valve. If every valve on campus was replaced, the University could reap a savings in the range of $ 5, 400 - $ 22, 590 over the 5 year useful life of the valve, having initially invested less than $ 550...|$|R
