5|$|A {{funeral was}} held on March 11, at the Montreal Forum, the arena where the Canadiens played. Fans were allowed to file past the casket, laid at center ice, and 50,000 people paid their respects. A {{rotating}} guard of honour of four Canadiens <b>stood</b> <b>around</b> the casket which was covered in flowers including a large wreath from Aurèle Joliat that was shaped like the number 7, Morenz's number, and a note from Morenz's three children.

5|$|The Doctor {{comes to}} the end of the {{transcript}} and Sally realises Larry has stopped writing it due to the presence of an Angel in the room. The Doctor, surmising their fate, warns them not even to blink around the Angels. Sally and Larry make their way to the basement of the house and discover more Angels guarding the TARDIS. The Angels attack and Sally and Larry use the Yale key to hide inside the TARDIS. The Angels surround and rock the TARDIS to try to gain entry. Once in the control room, a hologram of the Doctor informs them that they have a control disk with them. Larry takes a now-glowing DVD from his pocket and inserts it into the console. The TARDIS' engines engage and the ship dematerialises, leaving a panicking Sally and Larry behind. With the TARDIS gone, the Angels who were all <b>stood</b> <b>around</b> the TARDIS have been tricked into looking at each other and have become permanently frozen as statues.|$|E

25|$|The direct {{ancestor}} of all modern camels, Procamelus, {{existed in the}} upper Miocene and lower Pliocene. Around 3–5 million years ago, the North American Camelidae spread to South America {{as part of the}} Great American Interchange via the newly formed Isthmus of Panama, where they gave rise to guanacos and related animals, and to Asia via the Bering land bridge. Surprising finds of fossil Paracamelus on Ellesmere Island beginning in 2006 in the high Canadian Arctic indicate the dromedary is descended from a larger, boreal browser whose hump may have evolved as an adaptation in a cold climate.

25|$|Beginning January 1902, American General J.

According to the description given, Malvar was of dark complexion and <b>stood</b> <b>around</b> 5 feet 3 inches. He weighed about 145 pounds and wore a 5 or 6 size of shoes.

25|$|For {{five and}} a half years during the Second World War, Wilson's was {{evacuated}} to a Camp School at Itchingfield near Horsham, Sussex, and for the only period in its history became a boarding school. The whole compound <b>stood</b> <b>around</b> a broad elliptical area, set in large part to grass and the remainder, an asphalt quadrangle. Radiating from this central area, in spoke-like fashion, was a series of large cedarwood huts. These were the dormitories, ablution blocks and classrooms. Two larger buildings stood adjacent to the asphalted space, one the dining hall and the other the assembly hall which also functioned as the gym, cinema and church. The whole establishment catered for four hundred plus boys forming six houses, all named after past headmasters of the school, Nairn, Macdowell, Wilson, Kelly, Whiteley and Jephson. The Head Master of Christ's Hospital was kind enough to allow Wilson's the use of the school's cricket pitches, swimming bath and other facilities, including the Great Hall for Speech Day.|$|E

William Holmes, the Chief Whip, then called Huskisson to one side. He suggested that, with the Duke of Wellington in a particularly good mood owing to the cheering crowds which had lined the route, it might be a good time for Huskisson and the Duke to meet and try to arrange a reconciliation.|$|E
500|$|Today {{the pyramid}} is heavily ruined, its outer casing of fine white {{limestone}} long gone, and it stands only [...] tall. While graffiti {{left by the}} builders indicate that the construction of this pyramid dates to the later part of Nyuserre's reign and took place {{under the direction of}} vizier Ptahshepses, the name of the queen for whom the pyramid was intended is lost. Reptynub has been cited as a likely candidate. In the burial chamber, which is reached via a straight north-south passageway, the broken up mummy of a young woman was discovered. She <b>stood</b> <b>around</b> [...] tall and died between 21 and 23 years of age. It is unclear whether the mummy is that of the original owner of the pyramid or dates to a later period as the mummification method employed could suggest. Excavations of the burial chamber yielded fragments of a pink granite sarcophagus as well as pieces of large calcite canopic jars and smaller funerary equipment.|$|E
500|$|The playing surface sloped {{downwards}} and {{was initially}} {{known for being}} exceptionally muddy, but in 1880 the club's committee spent £100 improving the drainage. [...] Facilities were minimal and most spectators simply <b>stood</b> <b>around</b> {{the perimeter of the}} pitch, as was the case at most football grounds at the time. [...] A grandstand was erected behind one goal in 1881, but it was severely damaged in a storm in 1884 and was replaced by a more elaborate structure along one of the long sides of the playing area. [...] At the same time several other shelters were erected to give spectators in other areas cover from the elements. [...] The largest crowd registered at Hole-i'-th'-Wall was approximately 10,000 for a match against Preston North End in November 1884, but crowds of between 1,000 and 2,000 spectators were the norm at Olympic matches. [...] After the club's demise the pitch was taken over by the Blackburn Railway Clerks Club. [...] It is now the site of St. Mary's College.|$|E

500|$|The final was {{preceded by}} chaotic scenes as vast crowds surged into the stadium, far {{exceeding}} its official capacity of approximately 125,000. [...] A crowd estimated at up to 300,000 gained entrance and the terraces overflowed, {{with the result that}} spectators found their way into the area around the pitch and even onto the playing area itself. [...] Mounted policemen, including one on a light-coloured horse which became the defining image of the day, had to be brought in to clear the crowds from the pitch and allow the match to take place. [...] The match began 45 minutes late as crowds <b>stood</b> <b>around</b> the perimeter of the pitch. [...] Although West Ham started strongly, Bolton proved the dominant team for most of the match and won 2–0. David Jack scored a goal two minutes after the start of the match and Jack Smith added a controversial second goal during the second half. [...] The pre-match events prompted discussion in the House of Commons and led to the introduction of safety measures for future finals. [...] The match {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "White Horse Final" [...] and is commemorated by the White Horse Bridge at the new Wembley Stadium.|$|E

Beneath the World Trade Center complex was an underground shopping mall, which in turn had connections to various mass transit facilities including the New York City Subway system and the Port Authority's own PATH trains connecting Manhattan to New Jersey.|$|E
