5|$|The Firth is an {{important}} area for nature conservation and has a range of habitats including extensive mudflats, shingle shorelines and saltmarsh. The last named, which is well developed on Alloa Inch, is typically dominated by saltmarsh rush, sea club-rush, sea aster and common saltmarsh-grass. The inner Firth is important for nationally and internationally important numbers of wintering wildfowl and wading birds and hosts populations of shelduck, knot, redshank, great crested grebe, teal and goldeneye. The outer islands support significant numbers of nesting seabirds. The Bass Rock has more than 150,000 nesting northern gannets and is the largest single rock gannetry in the world. When viewed from the mainland much of the rock looks white due to {{the sheer number of}} birds (and their droppings, which give off 152 tonnes of ammonia per year). The scientific names for this gannet, Sula bassana and Morus bassanus, are derived from the rock. The bird was traditionally known locally as the <b>solan</b> goose, and its eggs and meat were considered delicacies. It is estimated that in 1850 almost 2000 birds were harvested from the rock. Other bird species on the rock include guillemot, razorbill, cormorant, puffin, eider duck and numerous gulls.|$|E

30|$|The role of siderophores in {{biocontrol}} has extensively {{been studied}} previously (<b>Solans</b> et al. 2016).

It has also been stated that colonization of the rhizosphere, production of antibiotics, and their antagonistic activity of P. aeruginosa are presumably due to the production of the siderophores (Sulochana et al. 2014). Hydroxamate siderophores are common among the bacterial community (Yeole et al. 2001 and Dharni et al. 2012); however, carboxylate siderophores have not been reported very often. Tian et al.
