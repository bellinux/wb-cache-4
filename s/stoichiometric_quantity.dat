50|$|In many supramolecular {{catalytic}} systems {{designed to}} work with bimolecular addition reactions like the Diels-Alder, {{the product of the}} reaction binds more strongly to the supramolecular host than the two substrates do, consequently leading to inhibition by the product.

50|$|Direct acylations of {{alcohols}} with carboxylic acids {{is preferred}} over acylations with anhydrides (poor atom economy) or acid chlorides (moisture sensitive). The main disadvantage of direct acylation is the unfavorable chemical equilibrium {{that must be}} remedied (e.g. by a large excess {{of one of the}} reagents), or by the removal of water (e.g. by using Dean-Stark distillation, anhydrous salts, molecular sieves, or by using a <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>quantity</b> of acid catalyst).|$|E
50|$|The {{reaction}} mechanism of carboxylic acid activation by HATU and subsequent N-acylation is summarised {{in the figure}} below. The mechanism is shown using the more commonly encountered and commercially available iminium isomer; a similar mechanism, however, is likely {{to apply to the}} uronium form. In the first step, the carboxylate anion (formed by deprotonation by an organic base shown) attacks HATU to form the unstable O-acyl(tetramethyl)isouronium salt. The OAt anion rapidly attacks the isouronium salt, affording the OAt-active ester and liberating a <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>quantity</b> of tetramethylurea. Addition of a nucleophile, such as an amine, to the OAt-active ester results in acylation.|$|E
50|$|Ethyl linear alpha olefin {{process is}} {{commonly}} called stoichiometric Ziegler process. It is a two-step process. In the first step, a <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>quantity</b> of triethyl aluminium in olefin diluent is reacted with excess ethylene at high pressure (above 1000 psig) and relatively low temperature (below 400 °F). On the average, nine moles of ethylene are added per mole of triethyl aluminium, resulting in, on average, a tri-octyl aluminium. The distribution of alkyl chains on the aluminium {{is determined by}} statistical bell curve distribution except for some smearing to the light side due to the kinetic phenomena and some smearing to the heavy side due to some incorporation of heavier olefins into the chain. Excess ethylene and olefin diluent are flashed off. The heavy aluminium tri-alkyls are reacted with ethylene again in a displacement or a tranalkylation reaction, but at high temperature (over 400 °F) and at low pressure (less than 1000 psig) to recover triethyl aluminium and a statistical distribution of linear alpha olefins, which serve as the olefin diluent in the chain-growth step.|$|E
