5|$|Thermoremanent {{magnetization}} is {{the main}} source of the magnetic anomalies around ocean ridges. As the <b>seafloor</b> spreads, magma wells up from the mantle, cools to form new basaltic crust {{on both sides of the}} ridge, and is carried away from it by <b>seafloor</b> spreading. As it cools, it records the direction of the Earth's field. When the Earth's field reverses, new basalt records the reversed direction. The result is a series of stripes that are symmetric about the ridge. A ship towing a magnetometer on the surface of the ocean can detect these stripes and infer the age of the ocean floor below. This provides information on the rate at which <b>seafloor</b> has spread in the past.|$|E
5|$|During {{the day the}} crossback stingaree {{is usually}} {{inactive}} {{and can be found}} partially or completely buried in sand on the sea floor.

5|$|Eight {{commercial}} {{contractors are}} currently {{licensed by the}} International Seabed Authority (an intergovernmental organization established to organize and control all mineral-related activities in the international seabed area {{beyond the limits of}} national jurisdiction) to explore nodule resources and to test mining techniques in eight claim areas, each covering 150,000km². When mining ultimately begins, each mining operation is projected to directly disrupt 300–800km² of <b>seafloor</b> per year and disturb the benthic fauna over an area 5–10 times that size due to redeposition of suspended sediments. Thus, over the 15-year projected duration of a single mining operation, nodule mining might severely damage abyssal <b>seafloor</b> communities over areas of 20,000 to 45,000km² (a zone at least the size of Massachusetts).|$|E

5|$|The {{creation}} of the abyssal plain {{is the result of}} the spreading of the <b>seafloor</b> (plate tectonics) and the melting of the lower oceanic crust. Magma rises from above the asthenosphere (a layer of the upper mantle), and as this basaltic material reaches the surface at mid-ocean ridges, it forms new oceanic crust, which is constantly pulled sideways by spreading of the <b>seafloor.</b> Abyssal plains result from the blanketing of an originally uneven surface of oceanic crust by fine-grained sediments, mainly clay and silt. Much of this sediment is deposited by turbidity currents that have been channelled from the continental margins along submarine canyons into deeper water. The rest is composed chiefly of pelagic sediments. Metallic nodules are common in some areas of the plains, with varying concentrations of metals, including manganese, iron, nickel, cobalt, and copper.|$|E
50|$|Zeugopterus regius {{is found}} over rocky substrates, less {{frequently}} on sandy <b>seafloors.</b> It feeds on invertebrates and small fish.

5|$|Though {{the plains}} were once {{assumed to be}} vast, desert-like habitats, {{research}} {{over the past decade}} or so shows that they teem with a wide variety of microbial life. However, ecosystem structure and function at the deep <b>seafloor</b> have historically been very poorly studied because of the size and remoteness of the abyss. Recent oceanographic expeditions conducted by an international group of scientists from the Census of Diversity of Abyssal Marine Life (CeDAMar) have found an extremely high level of biodiversity on abyssal plains, with up to 2000 species of bacteria, 250 species of protozoans, and 500 species of invertebrates (worms, crustaceans and molluscs), typically found at single abyssal sites. New species make up more than 80% of the thousands of <b>seafloor</b> invertebrate species collected at any abyssal station, highlighting our heretofore poor understanding of abyssal diversity and evolution. Richer biodiversity is associated with areas of known phytodetritus input and higher organic carbon flux.|$|E

40|$|Porto Pozzo is a NE-SW {{oriented}} “ria”, {{which is}} 4 km long and 350 m wide. It is located of river west of Liscia river mouth (NE Sardinia), between P. ta Falcone, westwards, and the peninsula of Culuccia, eastward. The southern coastal {{part of the}} bay is characterized by wide wetland settings (ponds and lagoons) communicating with the sea. Moreover, they present a particular environmental value in relation with their noterworthy floral and faunal biodiversity. Two oceanographic cruises (PALEOCLIGE 2000 and PALEOCLIGE 2001) have been realized in Porto Pozzo bay, in order to perform an interdisciplinary study concerning the geomorphological, sedimentological and palaeontological aspects of the <b>seafloors.</b> Through the Side Scan Sonar, Edgetech DF- 1000, a geomorphological map of Porto Pozzo bay (1 : 10000) has been obtained, highlighting the following geomorphological units: intramatte channel, intramatte depression, muddy sand bottom, Posidonia oceanica meadow and submerged beach. The <b>seafloors</b> of Porto Pozzo show a shallow depth, rarely exceeding 10 m. From the sedimentological point of view, sandy <b>seafloors</b> corresponding to delta-fronts mostly occur along the coastal platform between 0 and 5 m. The deeper <b>seafloors</b> show sandy pelites and, then, very sands pelites. These <b>seafloors</b> are also characterized by Posidonia oceanica meadow. In particular, this study focuses {{on the distribution of}} selected environmental markers (ostracods) to evidence the different environmental conditions of these <b>seafloors.</b> In Porto Pozzo bay 49 ostracod species belonging to 24 genera have been identified. 13 of them have been maintained in open nomenclature. The ostracods species found can be included in three groups corrisponding to part of the above mentioned geomorphological units. A group characterizes intermediate conditions between the two units. The three groups are descibed below: -Group 1 (Intramatte Channel) - The. species are: Aurila convexa, Loxoconcha rhomboidea, Loxoconcha sp. 1, Procythereideis senescens, Semicytherura rarecostata, Urocythereis sp. 1; -Group 2 (Intramatte Channel-Submergeed beach) - The. species are: Callistocythere cf. C. badia, Loxoconcha affinis, Tenedocythere prava, Xestoleberis communis, Xestoleberis dispar; -Group 3 (Submergeed beach) - The. species are: Aurila fallax, “Barbeitina” sp., Carinocythereis whithei, Hemicytherura videns, Loxoconcha ovulata, Phlyctocythere pellucida, Semicytherura acuticostata, Urocythereis gr. favosa. Through Shannon-Weaver (SW) biotic index, which considers the specific richness and the equitability, it is also possible to highlight the environmental conditions of the sampling stations. The SW index varies from 1, 39 to 2, 22. It is assumed that low values correspond to bad conditions; vice versa, high values indicate good conditions. In the investigated area, two categories have been identified: -CATEGORY 1 where 1 ≤ S. W. 2; The best conditions occur in sampling stations characterized by Intramatte Channel; the worst conditions occur in sampling stations by Submerged Beach. Intermediate conditions occur in sampling stations characterized by geomorfological units Intramatte Channel and Submerged Beach. It is possible to recognize species which are present in only one category and others occurring in both categories. The species exclusive of only one category are: Aurila fallax, Urocythereis gr. favosa, “Barbeitina” sp., Carinocythereis whithei, Hemicytherura videns, Loxoconcha ovulata, Phlyctocythere pellucida, Semicytherura acuticostata (CATEGORY 1), Loxoconcha rhomboidea, Aurila convexa, Urocythereis sp. 1, Loxoconcha sp. 1, Procythereideis senescens, Semicytherura rarecostata (CATEGORY 2). The species occurring in both categories are: Loxoconcha affinis, Callistocythere cf. C. badia, Tenedocythere prava, Xestoleberis communis, Xestoleberis dispar. Thus, taking into account these categories it is also possible to evidence bad-to-good environmental conditions, which are more or less favourable for the benthic life. Species exclusive of category 1 indicate bad environmental conditions. Ostracods exclusive of category 2 may testify favourable conditions for the benthic life. Species present in both categories may indicate a wider tolerance to the environmental changes than the previously mentioned species. These data can evidence that ostracods are good tools for the environmental monitoring.

5|$|Although {{generally}} Earth's {{field is}} approximately dipolar, with an axis that is nearly {{aligned with the}} rotational axis, occasionally the North and South geomagnetic poles trade places. Evidence for these geomagnetic reversals {{can be found in}} basalts, sediment cores taken from the ocean floors, and <b>seafloor</b> magnetic anomalies. Reversals occur nearly randomly in time, with intervals between reversals ranging from less than 0.1 million years to as much as 50 million years. The most recent geomagnetic reversal, called the Brunhes–Matuyama reversal, occurred about 780,000 years ago. A related phenomenon, a geomagnetic excursion, amounts to an incomplete reversal, with no change in polarity. The Laschamp event is an example of an excursion, it having occurred during the last ice age (41,000 years ago).|$|E

The volatile state of the Hawaiian volcanoes and their constant battle with the sea was a major element in Hawaiian mythology, embodied in Pele, the deity of volcanoes. After the arrival of Europeans on the island, in 1880–1881 James Dwight Dana directed the first formal geological study of the hotspot's volcanics, confirming the relationship long observed by the natives. 1912 marked the founding of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory by volcanologist Thomas Jaggar, initiating continuous scientific observation of the islands.

A week after Rusty passed through Pilbara, an algal bloom the size of Tasmania appeared offshore.

40|$|The Miocene Termina Formation of the {{northern}} Apennines (Italy) contains thin marly limestone or marly sandstone bodies rich in macrofauna mainly consisting of large lucinid clams. Modern representatives of this fauna occur in cold seep settings where they house chemosymbiotic bacteria. Moreover, these rocks record a delta 13 C-depletion confirming their origin influenced by a cold seep. The Miocene sections of Sasso delle Streghe and Sarsetta (near Modena) represent classic examples of cold seeps. These sections consist of marls and marly sandstones, respectively, with lucinids (Sasso delle Streghe) or bioclastic sands with lucinids (Sarsetta); both sections are capped by the Sandstones of Montebaranzone. They yield ostracodes that are mainly represented by deep-water filter-feeder species (Platycopa, i. e. Cytherella sp.) and numerous deposit-feeders (Podocopa: i. e. Neonesidea and Krithe), together with species frequently occurring in shallow water environments. These assemblages are able to colonize disaerobic environments such as cold seeps. Although some authors consider the filter-feeders as dominant taxa in disaerobic settings, our data do not provide evidence of {{significant differences in the}} ostracode assemblage composition between the deposits originated in <b>seafloors</b> with or without seepage influence. However, the number of specimens is greater in <b>seafloors</b> devoid of seepage influence...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMapping <b>seafloors</b> is a {{fundamental}} step for managing and/or preserving coastal zones. Various methods {{have been used to}} map <b>seafloors,</b> primarily benthic macrofauna and sediment sampling along regular grids or transects, bathymetry and/or remote sensing. These methods map very different things (e. g. biotic or abiotic features, benthic assemblages, and/or benthic habitats), and {{they do not have the}} same accuracy levels nor do they have the same cost in time and money. Furthermore, such methods often require the competencies of highly skilled scientists. Here, we propose a method called the Naturalist Method (NM), based essentially on direct field observations of specific biotic and abiotic criteria. This method was tested and compared with other classical mapping methods. The results show that our NM is relatively rapid and inexpensive given the highly accurate results obtained. Moreover, NM is particularly suitable for highly-fragmented intertidal landscapes where other methods are often limited. Direct field observation data can be sufficient and suitable to map intertidal habitats in well known coastal areas such as the European coasts. In consequence, the method we developed can be used by non-specialist, like protected-area managers, and because it is an inexpensive and a quick method, long-term monitoring mapping are possible. Furthermore, this method is particularly relevant to map highly fragmented areas...|$|R
