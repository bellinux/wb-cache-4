5|$|Simonovich-Efimova died on 24 February 1948 in Moscow, Soviet Union. Posthumously, she was {{inducted}} into the International Academy of Puppeteers for her innovations in life-sized puppets. The couple are known as the Adam and Eve of Russian puppetry. <b>She</b> <b>left</b> <b>a</b> large legacy, including around 3,000 works, some of which are housed in a memorial workshop at their former home, though art historians mostly ignored her work {{until the end of the}} 20th century. Her works can be seen in the permanent collections of the Russian Museum, Tretyakov Gallery, the Tver Regional Art Gallery, among others. There have been posthumous solo exhibitions of her work in 1959, 1968 and 1975. In 2011, The Museum of Russian Art (TMORA) in Minneapolis, Minnesota included some of her ethnic paintings of women in their native dress. The following year, her 1935 book, Adventures of a Russian Puppet Theatre: Including Its Discoveries in Making and Performing with Hand-Puppets, Rod-Puppets and Shadow-Figures (English version) was reprinted by Martino Publishing.

500|$|Born in 1924 as Maria Limanskaya, {{she joined}} the Red Army in 1942, {{at the height of}} World War II. She was 18. At that time the Soviet Stavka ("high command") {{increasingly}} lacked trained reserves to reinforce the entire [...] front, and as a result began to conscript underage men and women. Almost 800,000 women would eventually serve in the Red Army throughout the war. Little is known about Limanskaya's military career other than several occasions where she was nearly killed.

500|$|Sejanus {{remained}} powerful {{until his}} sudden downfall and summary execution in October 31, the exact reasons for which remain unclear. On 26 October 31, just eight {{days after his}} death, his wife Apicata committed suicide. According to Cassius Dio, <b>she</b> <b>left</b> <b>a</b> message for the emperor: his son had been murdered by his wife Livilla and her lover, Sejanus. The story should be read with caution. Levick says that Sejanus must have murdered Drusus in self-defense because only Tiberius stood between the Praetorian Prefect {{and the end of}} his career at the hands of Drusus. Furthermore, he says it is even less likely that Livilla would have been complicit in the destruction of her family, the key to her children's future. Levick dismisses the accusation of Apicata as the revenge of a woman whose husband left her for another.|$|E

[...] At this time he began working on a philosophical novel, Séraphîta, about a hermaphroditic angel united by the love of a mortal man for a compassionate and sensual woman. Balzac explained that she was his model for the latter. It was clear to all that Hański was in ill health, and Hańska began to think about her future with the French author. In the meantime, she asked Balzac to begin collecting for her autographs of the famous people he spent time with in Paris and elsewhere.|$|E

500|$|By 1808 it {{was still}} {{considered}} unsafe to return to Berlin, and the royal family consequently spent the summer near Königsberg; Louise believed that the hard trials of her children's early lives {{would be good for}} them: [...] "If they had been reared in luxury and prosperity they might think that so it must always be." [...] In the winter of 1808, Tsar Alexander I invited the king and queen to St. Petersburg, where she was treated to sumptuously decorated rooms; [...] "Nothing dazzles me anymore", she exclaimed on her return to Germany. Near the birth of her youngest child Princess Louise in 1809, Louise wrote to her father, [...] "Gladly...the calamities which have befallen us have not forced their way into our wedded and home life, rather have strengthened the same, and made it even more precious to us." [...] Louise was sick for much of that year, but returned with the king to Berlin near the end of it after an absence of three years; the queen arrived in a carriage accompanied by her two daughters Charlotte and Alexandrine and younger son Charles, and was greeted by her father at Charlottenburg Palace– the residence was ransacked however, as Napoleon and his commanders had stripped its rooms of paintings, statues, manuscripts, and antiquities.
