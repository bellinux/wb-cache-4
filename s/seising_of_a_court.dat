40|$|The {{criteria}} of the Council Regulation (EC) No 2201 / 2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the {{recognition and enforcement}} of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility, repealing Regulation (EC) No 1347 / 2000 (hereinafter: Regulation) concerning the jurisdiction in the matters of parental responsibility differ from the criteria adopted in domestic law. First, this applies to situations in which the ancillary matters relating to parental responsibility are connected with the divorce proceedings. The specificities of these proceedings of domestic law are also peaceful resolution mechanisms. The peaceful resolution mechanisms should precede the <b>seising</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>court,</b> which opens {{the question of the}} definition of “seising of a court” in the system of the jurisdiction established by the Regulation. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyse the rules of the (international) jurisdiction for the ancillary proceedings on parental responsibility. The practical issues that arise from the implementation of the Regulation are also discussed. At the time of writing, the Proposal for a recast of the Regulation was published, in which certain interventions in the system of jurisdiction in the matters of parental responsibility are made. The procedural consequences of the revised rules on jurisdiction in the matters of parental responsibility are also analysed in this paper...|$|E
40|$|American judges, <b>seised</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> case {{requiring}} them to appraise, under international law, a foreign government 2 ̆ 7 s acts, have few attractive options. If they routinely agree to decide these cases, the political costs to the Executive of conducting foreign affairs could increase, sometimes critically. If they routinely refuse these cases, plaintiffs are denied judicial protection. If they follow Executive instructions on a case-by-case basis, judicial independence suffers. It is <b>a</b> dilemma for <b>courts</b> and <b>a</b> continuing uncertainty for users and students of international law.

5000|$|Milton {{was held}} with land in Adgestone, of the manor of Appleford {{for the service}} <b>of</b> half <b>a</b> knight's fee. The manor was given by Queen Eleanor in 1280 to John de Weston and Christina his wife. John died <b>seised</b> <b>of</b> it in 1323-4, when his son John succeeded. On his death in 1344 the manor passed to his brother William, a clerk in holy orders. In 1346 Katherine de Weston held the manor, and in 1354 Thomas de Weston died <b>seised</b> <b>of</b> it, leaving as his heirs his {{daughter}} Eleanor wife of Sir John de Rattlesden, his granddaughters Eleanor and Isabel daughters of another daughter Margaret and his grandson Roger, son of another daughter Isabel. The eldest co-heir Eleanor is perhaps {{to be identified with}} Eleanor wife of Sir William Bouchier, kt., who died <b>seised</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> quarter fee in Milton in 1397. Her heir was her son William, but John Haket was holding the estate {{at the end of the}} 14th century, and was returned for aid in 1428 as holding the de Weston half fee with Henry Howles, the latter being succeeded in the joint holding three years later by John Roucle or Rookley.|$|R
50|$|The overlordship of Dibden {{belonged in}} the 12th century to Reynold de St. Valery, {{who died in}} 1166, and his son Bernard de St. Valery, who was killed at the siege of Acon in 1192, was {{probably}} the Bernard who was lord of Dibden in 1167. Descending with his granddaughters to Robert Count of Dreux, it fell, {{with the rest of}} the honour of St. Valery, into the hands of the Crown, when it was given to Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall whose son Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall died in 1300 <b>seised</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fee there which belonged to the honour of St. Valery. Dibden was thereafter held of the Crown. It was thus held in the reign of Henry VII of Arthur, Prince of Wales.|$|R
2500|$|This {{was within}} Peper Harow Park, {{but in the}} parish of Witley, and was early held by Richer de Aquila and {{subsequently}} his grandson heir Gilbert. [...] It {{was included in the}} Dissolution of the Monasteries grant of Waverley Abbey to Sir William Fitz William, with which it descended to Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu who died <b>seised</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> messuage called Oxenford, 9 October 1592. Similarly to the above, Sir George More of Loseley in 1609, Oxenford passed to Bartholomew Hone and heir John Chesterton of St. Giles in the Fields in 1619. In 1667 Antony Covert and his son conveyed their third to John Platt of Westbrook and his heirs; his son Sir John Platt and a John Smith sold it to prominent parliamentarian Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles; the other third was sold by the Fox family to George Brodrick, 4th Viscount Midleton c. 1822; his son employed Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin to build an imitation 13th century farm here.|$|R
