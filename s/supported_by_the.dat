40|$|We empirically analyze whether <b>support</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> parent {{organization}} in the early (nascent and seed) stage speeds up the process of commercialization and helps spin-offs from public research organizations generate first revenues sooner. To identify <b>the</b> impact of <b>support</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{parent organization}}, we apply multivariate regression techniques {{as well as an}} instrumental variable approach. Our results show that support in <b>the</b> early stage <b>by</b> <b>the</b> parent organization can speed up commercialization. Moreover, we identify two distinct channels - the help in developing a business plan and in acquiring external capital - through which <b>support</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> parent organization can enable spin-offs to generate first revenues sooner...|$|R
