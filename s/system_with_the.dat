5|$|In {{the middle}} of August 2015, a strong {{westerly}} wind surge along the equator produced two areas of convection, or thunderstorm activity, near the Marshall Islands in the western Pacific Ocean. The westernmost disturbance became associated with a circulation center near Ujelang Atoll. With low wind shear and favorable sea surface temperatures, tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated further development of both convective systems. The westernmost system developed a banding pattern by August13, indicative of increased organization. At 18:00UTC that day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified it as a tropical depression, centered about 700km (435mi) east-southeast of Guam.
