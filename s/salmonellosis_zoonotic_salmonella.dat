40|$|Pets, {{including}} reptiles, {{have been}} shown to be a source of Salmonella infection in humans. Due to increasing popularity and variety of exotic reptiles as pets in recent years, more human clinical cases of reptile-associated Salmonella infection have been identified. However, limited information is available with regard to serotypes in different reptiles (turtles, snakes, and lizards) and antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella in pet reptiles. The current study was thus conducted to determine the prevalence of Salmonella colonization in pet reptiles. Salmonella organisms were isolated from 30. 9 % of 476 reptiles investigated. The isolation prevalences were 69. 7 % (23 / 33), 62. 8 % (27 / 43), and 24. 3 % (97 / 400) in snakes, lizards, and turtles, respectively. A total of 44 different Salmonella serovars were identified.

In this study, we report the construction of methionine-dependent and growth of Salmonella Typhimurium mutant strains with methionine auxotrophy (ΔmetR and ΔΔmetRmetD) and survival in chicken feed and fecal matrices. The methionine auxotroph mutant ΔΔmetRmetD grew slowly on L-methionine but failed to grow on D-methionine, as expected, and exhibited lower affinity for methionine compared with the isogenic parent strain (ΔmetR single mutant) in whole-cell affinity experiments. Preliminary data conducted as part of a previously published bird challenge study indicated that the methionine auxotroph was less effective at protection in chickens to a challenge with virulent wild-type parent strain but generated greater Salmonella-specific serum IgG. Although the auxotroph could not sustain itself in minimal media it was able to survive when incubated in the presence of chicken and fecal material.

Reporting on actual consumption of antimicrobial agents has been underway since 2010, together with monitoring and reporting of sales of veterinary antimicrobial agents since 2009, by some countries and encompassing most of the EU/EEA in later years. The first integrated report by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) suggesting possible relationships between the consumption of antimicrobial agents and the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance was published in 2015.

40|$|Strains of Salmonella spp. with {{resistance}} to antimicrobial drugs are now widespread in both {{developed and developing}} countries. In developed countries it is now increasingly accepted {{that for the most}} part such strains are zoonotic in origin and acquire their resistance in the food-animal host before onward transmission to humans through the food chain. Of particular importance since the early 1990 s has been a multiresistant strain of Salmonella typhimurium definitive phage type (DT) 104, displaying {{resistance to}} up to six commonly used antimicrobials, with about 15 % of isolates also exhibiting decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. Mutations in the gyrA gene in such isolates have been characterised by a PCR LightCycler-based gyrA mutation assay, and at least four different mutations have been identified. Multiple resistance (to four or more antimicrobials) is also common in the poultry-associated pathogens Salmonella virchow and Salmonella hadar, with an increasing number of strains of these serotypes exhibiting decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. Multiple resistance is also being found in other serotypes in several other European countries, and has been associated with treatment failures. For Salmonella typhi, multiple drug resistance is now the norm in strains originating in the Indian subcontinent and south^east Asia. Such multiresistant strains have been responsible for several epidemics and some of these have been associated with contaminated water supplies. Furthermore, an increasing number of multiresistant strains of S. typhi are now exhibiting decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, with concomitant treatment failures.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{report on}} the {{prevalence}} of isolates with ciprofloxacin resistance in non-typhoidal salmonellas from humans in England and Wales in 1997. MethodsAll non-typhoidal salmonellas referred to the Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens in 1997 were screened for resistance to ciprofloxacin at 0. 125 and 1. 0 mg/L and nalidixic acid at 16 mg/L, and results were compared to those for 1994. Full minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of these antimicrobials were also determined for a selection of isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin at 0. 125 mg/L but sensitive at 1. 0 mg/L, and for all isolates resistant at 1. 0 mg/L. ResultsSince 1994 there have been increases in the occurrence of resistance to ciprofloxacin (MICs: 0. 25 - 1. 0 mg/L) in Salmonella enterica serotypes Enteritidis, Typhimurium, Virchow and Hadar. Of particular importance have been increases in the occurrence of resistance in multiresistant S. Typhimurium DT 104, and also in S. virchow, a serotype with a propensity for causing extraintestinal infections in humans. High-level resistance (MIC≥ 2. 0 mg/L) was uncommon and was identified {{in only a few}} strains, all from patients with a history of recent foreign travel. ConclusionsThere is a strong temporal association between increases in the occurrence of ciprofloxacin resistance in Salmonella serotypes Typhimurium, Virchow and Hadar from humans in England and Wales and with the licensing for use in food animals in the UK of the related fluoroquinolone antibiotic enrofloxacin; in contrast, for S. enteritidis ciprofloxacin resistance was most common in a phage type associated with foreign travel.

40|$|We {{describe}} Salmonella control {{programs of}} broiler chickens, layer hens, and pigs in Denmark. Major {{reductions in the}} incidence of foodborne human salmonellosis have occurred by integrated control of farms and food processing plants. Disease control has been achieved by monitoring the herds and flocks, eliminating infected animals, and diversifying animals (animals and products are processed differently depending on Salmonella status) and animal food products according to the determined risk. In 2001, the Danish society saved U. S. $ 25. 5 million by controlling Salmonella. The total annual Salmonella control costs in year 2001 were U. S. $ 14. 1 million (U. S. $ 0. 075 /kg of pork and U. S. $ 0. 02 /kg of broiler or egg). These costs are paid almost exclusively by the industry. The control principles described are applicable to most industrialized countries with modern intensive farming systems. Salmonellosis {{is one of the most}} common causes of foodborne diarrheal disease worldwide. Most of these infections are zoonotic and are transmitted from healthy carrier animals to humans through contaminated food. The main reservoir of <b>zoonotic</b> <b>Salmonella</b> is food animals, and the main sources of infections in industrialized countries are animal-derived products, notably fresh meat products and eggs. In developing countries, contaminated vegetables, water, and human-to-human transmission are believed to contribute to a comparatively larger proportion of the human cases than those in industrialized countries (1). However, the incidence of human salmonellosis increased in most industrialized countries in the 1980 s and 1990 s. Rapid spread of a limited number of successful Salmonella clones in different sectors of food animal production (swine, broiler chickens, and particularly layer hens) has been suggested as the most important cause of this increase (2).

40|$|Multicopy {{single-stranded}} DNAs (msDNAs) are hybrid RNA-DNA molecules encoded on retroelements called retrons {{and produced}} {{by the action of}} retron reverse transcriptases. Retrons are widespread in bacteria but the natural function of msDNA has remained elusive despite 30 years of study. The major roadblock to elucidation of the function of these unique molecules has been the lack of any identifiable phenotypes for mutants unable to make msDNA. We report that msDNA of the <b>zoonotic</b> pathogen <b>Salmonella</b> Typhimurium is necessary for colonization of the intestine. Similarly, we observed a defect in intestinal persistence in an enteropathogenic E. coli mutant lacking its retron reverse transcriptase. Under anaerobic conditions in the absence of msDNA, proteins of central anaerobic metabolism needed for Salmonella colonization of the intestine are dysregulated. We show that the msDNA-deficient mutant can utilize nitrate, but not other alternate electron acceptors in anaerobic conditions. Consistent with the availability of nitrate in the inflamed gut, a neutrophilic inflammatory response partially rescued the ability of a mutant lacking msDNA to colonize the intestine. These findings together indicate that the mechanistic basis of msDNA function during Salmonella colonization of the intestine is proper production of proteins needed for anaerobic metabolism. We further conclude that a natural function of msDNA is to regulate protein abundance, the first attributable function for any msDNA.

There is an on-going study within our laboratory is investigating the effects of sampling times and sampling methods on the cultural and molecular (via qPCR) quantification of dominant zoonotic pathogens within a poultry processing facility. This presents a unique opportunity to compare the quantification resulted from this emerging, third generation technology to traditional quantification methods currently employed by the poultry industry. The results show that ddPCR detected pathogen-specific genes from more pathogen:sampling time combina-tions than either the qPCR or culturing methods from the final scalder and chiller tanks at three stages of processing (Start, Mid, and End). In fact, both ddPCR and qPCR substantially outperformed culture methods commonly used in poultry processing food safety-related studies, with Salmonella recovered only from the Mid and End sampling time...|$|R
40|$|The {{virulence}} factor PgtE is {{an outer}} membrane protease (omptin) of the <b>zoonotic</b> pathogen <b>Salmonella</b> enterica that causes diseases ranging from gastroenteritis to severe enteric fever. It is surface exposed in bacteria {{that have a}} short-chain, i. e. rough LPS, as observed e. g. in bacteria residing inside macrophages or just emerging from them. We investigated whether PgtE cleaves the complement factors B (B) and H (H), key proteins controlling formation and inactivation of the complement protein C 3 b and thereby {{the activity of the}} complement system. S. enterica serovar Typhimurium or omptin-expressing recombinant E. coli bacteria were incubated with purified human complement proteins or recombinant H fragments. PgtE cleaved both B and H, whereas its close homolog Pla of Yersinia pestis cleaved only H. H was cleaved at both N- and C-termini, while the central region resisted proteolysis. Because of multiple effects of PgtE on complement components (cleavage of C 3, C 3 b, B and H) we assessed its effect on the opsonophagocytosis of Salmonella. In human serum, C 3 cleavage was dependent on proteolytically active PgtE. Human neutrophils interacted less with serum-opsonized FITC-stained S. enterica 14028 R than with the isogenic ΔpgtE strain, as analyzed by flow cytometry. In conclusion, cleavage of B and H by PgtE, together with C 3 cleavage, affects the C 3 -mediated recognition of S. enterica by human neutrophils, thus thwarting the immune protection against Salmonella...|$|R
40|$|For organic pig {{production}} little {{information is available}} about potential food safety problems with respect to <b>zoonotic</b> bacteria like <b>salmonella.</b> The aim {{of the current study}} was to examine the salmonella infection dynamics in organic pigs through an outdoor experimental set-up. Pigs inoculated with Salmonella Typhimurium were grouped with non-infected tracerpigs to determine the transmission of salmonella between animals. The results indicated that the organic pigs were perceptive to infections but that the susceptibility varied considerably between pigs. Furthermore, bacteriological examinations of soil and water samples from the pasture environment showed the ability of salmonella to survive in the non-host environment. Moreover, introduction of salmonella-free pigs into such naturally contaminated pastures caused salmonella-infections in some of the pigs, but mainly where the infection rate had been high previously. Elimination of salmonella-infected animals at an early stage would minimize the build up of high contamination levels and this could probably help to control the spread and persistence of salmonella in outdoor pigs...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{assessed}} {{the presence of}} IS 26 in food-borne ASSuT-type Salmonella enterica isolates. A new genetic region (R 3) was described, that included a C 14 caspase gene between IS 26 elements. R 3 was present in two Salmonella Rissen isolates from a swine carcass and a meat handler, collected at the same abattoir. Furthermore, a new rearrangement of resistance region R 1, harboring the blaTEM- 1 gene flanked by IS 26 elements, was identified in Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella 4,[5], 12 :i:-, from different samples. This study highlights the <b>zoonotic</b> potential of <b>Salmonella</b> spp. isolates and the possible role of IS 26 in the mobilization of resistance genes. V.

40|$|With the {{extensive}} use of antibiotics in livestock production, surveillance revealed an increase in Salmonella resistance to the commonly used antimicrobials in veterinary and public health. This serious threat to health care is further exacerbated by the limited epidemiological information about the common <b>zoonotic</b> agent, <b>Salmonella</b> enteritidis, required to determine antibiotic therapy. The aim was to characterise the antimicrobial resistance patterns of S. enteritidis isolates across different timelines (1972 – 2005) with accompanying genetic changes being investigated. Thirty-seven stored S. enteritidis isolates were collected from the Central Veterinary Laboratory, Harare, with antimicrobial susceptibility determined against eight antibiotics. Plasmids were isolated to analyse any genetic variation. An overall significant increase in resistance (p < 0. 05) to nalidixic acid (0 % – 10 %), ampicillin (14. 3 % – 50 %), tetracycline (14. 3 % – 30 %) and erythromycin (71. 4 % – 100 %) was observed across the timeline. However, {{the highest rates of}} susceptibility were maintained for gentamicin, sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim, kanamycin and chloramphenicol. We report an increase in multidrug resistance (MDR) of 14. 2 % – 50 % with an increase in resistotypes and plasmid profiles across the timeline. Eleven plasmid profiles were obtained in the 37 isolates studied with a minority of isolates (21. 6 %, 8 / 37) harbouring a 54 kb plasmid, commonly serovar-specific. A concerning increase in antimicrobial resistance to commonly administered drugs was observed across the timeline. The surge in MDR is of great concern and implies the need for consistent antimicrobial stewardship. No correlation was observed between the plasmid and antibiotic profiles...|$|R
