25|$|Wanda Rogers, who had {{suffered}} {{from a number of}} personal problems for some time, became unreliable and difficult to work with. Concert scheduling was difficult as she sometimes failed to turn up for performances. In 1970, Rogers recorded songs for a solo album, produced by Smokey Robinson and including covers of earlier Motown recordings, which Motown decided to market as The Return of The Marvelettes. As this album featured no other Marvelettes, original member Katherine Anderson refused to participate in appearing {{on the cover of the}} album due to what she felt was Motown's disrespect towards her and the group. The album was only a modest hit, reaching #50 on the R album charts and featured no charted hit singles. Following this, the group disbanded with Katherine Anderson settling briefly as a <b>staff</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> Motown. After Motown moved to Los Angeles in 1972, Anderson and Rogers left the business altogether returning to Michigan with Anderson settling in her hometown of Inkster while Rogers moved to Southfield, Michigan.
