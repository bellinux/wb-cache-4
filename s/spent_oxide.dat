Additionally, inert materials such as silica sand, as well as more traditional sorbents, such as dolomite and limestone, were tested to serve as reference data. The Phase 1 effort also explored the overall domestic availability of the best performing waste metal oxide sorbents, taking into account their geographic distributions, intrinsic value, etc. to provide the groundwork for a low cost, highly effective sulfur sorbent which can be quickly implemented on a commercial scale for such processes as IGCC and PFBC.

Prior to the {{widespread}} construction of interstate natural gas pipelines in the 1950 s, gas manufactured from coal, petroleum or other hydrocarbon feedstock was produced for lighting and heating purposes by local utilities {{in cities and}} towns across the United States. By-products and wastes generated at these plants were commonly disposed of on site. Major wastes and by-products included tar and oil residues, <b>spent</b> <b>oxides</b> and ash materials. These materials can be a continuing source of pollutants threatening both groundwater and surface water bodies. Pollutants include a complex mixture of hundreds of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), heavy metals and cyanides. A former manufactured gas plant (MGP) is located in downtown Clayville, Georgia, on the south bank of the Indian River. Facility and geographic {{names have been changed}} to protect the privacy of the parties involved. By-products from the plant were estimated at 14, 000 tons of coke and 22, 000 gallons of tar in 1929. Disposal practices at smaller MGP sites typical of the subject facility included landfilling of purifier (oxide) wastes, tar sludge, ammonia recovery wastes, ashes, clinkers, coke wastes, building material wastes, etc. Based upon available data from the public record, and the history of this and other former MGP sites, the mobility, toxicity, and volume of free-phase coal tar in the subsurface has been estimated along with its associated environmental contamination. Results indicated that up to 300, 000 gallons of free-phase liquid coal tar may remain in the subsurface soils and aquifer. The residual tar and other MGP contaminants have resulted in groundwater contamination exceeding the Georgia drinking water standards. Groundwater under the site is hydraulically connected with the adjacent major river with possible movement of contaminants into the local ecology. Sponsored and Organized by: U. S.

The head-end step, termed DEOX for its emphasis on decladding via oxidation, employs high temperatures to promote the oxidation of UO 2 to U 3 O 8 via an oxygen carrier gas. During oxidation, the spent fuel experiences a 30 % increase in lattice structure volume resulting in the separation of fuel from cladding. An added benefit of the head-end step is the removal of fission products, either via direct release from the broken fuel structure or via oxidation and volatilization by the high temperature process. The DEOX program at the Idaho National Laboratory has progressed from an initial exploratory phase, where the objective was the optimization of particle size and fuel-clad separation [1], to a phase more applicable to current flowsheet development, i. e. the removal and collection of targeted fission products [2]. The behavior of fission products has been investigated via testing with irradiated spent fuel {{to determine the effects of}} temperature, pressure, oxidative gas, and cladding on the removal efficiencies of targeted fission products. In addition, a preliminary design for the retention of fission products in an off-gas treatment system has been initiated as part of a collaborative effort with Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute through an International Nuclear Energy Research Initiative (I-NERI). RECENT PROGRESS Using a set low temperature oxidation cycle near 500 oC, additional conditions have been applied to distinguish their effects on the removal of targeted fission products. Both oxygen and air have been utilized during the oxidation portion followed by vacuum conditions to temperatures as high as 1050 oC. In addition, the effects of cladding on fission product removal have also been investigated with released fuel to temperatures greater than 500 oC. Results from these experiments as well as those from on-going tests will be presented. Shown in Fig. 1 is the conceptual design for a vertical split tube furnace which includes four separately controlled heating zones. The lowest zone contains the <b>spent</b> <b>oxide</b> fuel while the upper three zones are for the collection of specific off-gassed fission products.

However, these calculations suggest that Nuclear Resonance Fluorescence is not sufficiently sensitive for low plutonium- 239 concentrations, < 1 % atom percent, which is the concentration present in spent pressurized water reactor fuel. Investigation into the lack of sensitivity was inconclusive. A more in-depth analysis of COG?s capabilities in this area should be conducted...|$|R
40|$|A {{process of}} {{separating}} transuranium actinide values from uranium values present in <b>spent</b> nuclear <b>oxide</b> fuels containing rare earth and noble metal fission products {{as well as}} other fission products is disclosed. The oxide fuel is reduced with Ca metal in the presence of Ca chloride and a U-Fe alloy which is liquid at about 800 {degrees}C to dissolve uranium metal and the noble metal fission product metals and transuranium actinide metals and rare earth fission product metals leaving Ca chloride having CaO and fission products of alkali metals and the alkali earth metals and iodine dissolved therein. The Ca chloride and CaO and the fission products contained therein are separated from the U-Fe alloy and the metal values dissolved therein. The U-Fe alloy having dissolved therein reduced metals from the spent nuclear fuel is contacted with a mixture of one or more alkali metal or alkaline earth metal halides selected from the class consisting of alkali metal or alkaline earth metal and Fe or U halide or a combination thereof to transfer transuranium actinide metals and rare earth metals to the halide salt leaving the uranium and some noble metal fission products in the U-Fe alloy and thereafter separating the halide salt and the transuranium metals dissolved therein from the U-Fe alloy and the metals dissolved therein...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFluoride Volatility Method is {{regarded}} to be a promising advanced pyrochemical reprocessing technology, {{which can be}} used for reprocessing mainly of <b>oxide</b> <b>spent</b> fuels coming from current LWRs or future GEN IV fast reactors. The technology should be chiefly suitable for the reprocessing of advanced oxide fuels with inert matrixes of very high burn-up and short cooling time, which can be hardly reprocessed by hydrometallurgical technologies. Fluoride Volatility Method is based on direct fluorination of powdered spent fuel with fluorine gas in a flame fluorination reactor, where the volatile fluorides (mostly UF 6) are separated from the non-volatile ones (trivalent minor actinides and majority of fission products). The subsequent operations necessary for partitioning of volatile fluorides are condensation and evaporation of volatile fluorides, thermal decomposition of PuF 6 and finally distillation and sorption used for the purification of uranium product...|$|R
