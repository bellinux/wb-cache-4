30|$|Moisture {{absorbed by}} {{concrete}} expands and contracts with temperature {{changes and the}} resulting mechanical action can cause cracks, fractures, and spalling. Airborne compounds, such as carbon dioxide, can also cause adverse chemical reactions {{which can lead to}} surface deterioration (Freeman et al. 1999). When a concrete structure is often exposed to deicing <b>salts,</b> <b>salt</b> <b>splashes,</b> <b>salt</b> spray, or seawater, chloride ions from these will slowly penetrate into the concrete. The chloride ions eventually reach the steel and then accumulate beyond a certain concentration level. The protective passivity is destroyed and the steel begins to corrode, since oxygen and moisture are present at the steel–concrete interface. Cracking and spalling may occur in the concrete due to the formation of voluminous corrosion products, which are up to six times the volume of the original steel. Corrosion of the reinforcing steel and prestressing strands {{at the end of the}} girder is the most destructive deterioration mechanism for reinforced concrete bridges in the United States (Weyers et al. 1993).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Hodder Avenue {{underpass}} – {{recipient of}} the Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute (PCI) ’s Harry H. Edwards Industry Advancement Award – is a new highway bridge near Thunder Bay, Canada that utilized a modular construction approach facilitated by the extensive use of ultra-high performance fibre-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) to expedite construction, elevate aesthetic value and enhance quality and durability. Almost all structural components were precast in facilities and assembled on site using UHPFRC joints, which have compact geometries with less complexity, superior durability and strength. The precast elements include a unique UHPFRC pier cap and pier column shells, high performance concrete (HPC) box girders, sidewalks/parapet walls, abutment caps, ballast walls, slope paving panels and approach slabs. Aesthetically, the structure achieved a slender and open form {{with the use of}} shallow precast box girders and a unique pier cap visually and structurally integral with the superstructure. The cap beam was prestressed and precast fully with UHPFRC to overcome design challenges such as geometrical limitations and complex loading. The pier cap and girders were made composite using field-cast UHPFRC joints reinforced with stainless steel bars and threaded bolts. The pier columns also utilized a unique design with precast UHPFRC shells serving as an aesthetic stay-in-place form as well as a protective layer for the <b>salt</b> <b>splashes</b> during Thunder Bay’s harsh winter seasons...|$|R
50|$|Between 1983 and {{the early}} 2000s {{a broad range of}} compact cameras were made by Nikon. Nikon first started by naming the cameras with a series name (like the L35/L135-series, the RF/RD-series, the W35-series, the EF or the AW-series). In later {{production}} cycles, the cameras were double branded with a series-name on the one and a sales name on the other hand. Sales names were for example Zoom-Touch for cameras with a wide zoom range, Lite-Touch for ultra compact models, Fun-Touch for easy to use cameras and Sport-Touch for <b>splash</b> water <b>resistance.</b> After the late 1990s, Nikon dropped the series names and continued only with the sales name. Nikon's APS-cameras were all named Nuvis.|$|R

40|$|Before World War II, {{an ocean}} floor cable was laid between Nemuro city and kunashiri Island in Japanese {{northern}} territory. Then a reinforced concrete structure was {{built as a}} communication system in Nemuro City. The structure is located near the beach line of about 12 m. The external deterioration is very severe in the cold sea environment due to the penetration of the <b>salt</b> at the <b>splash</b> zone and the many cycles of freezing and thawing over many years.

40|$|Design for {{durability}} of road infrastructures {{is becoming increasingly}} important in view of its large impact on economics. Reinforcement corrosion {{is the most common}} cause of concrete deterioration of bridge structures in Latvia. The ingress of chlorides is often considered to be the major threat to {{durability of}} concrete structures. During the winter season de-icing salts are spread out on roads to avoid formation of ice and ensure the anti-sliding properties of the road surface. The melting water mixes with de-icing <b>salt</b> and is <b>splashed</b> and sprayed on reinforced concrete pier structures by passing vehicles. Absorbed water with chloride ions initiates and accelerates the reinforcement corrosion process. This paper highlights the results of investing accumulation of chlorides in reinforced concrete bridge piers located near high-intensity roads in Latvia. The chloride contents were determined on different surfaces of reinforced concrete piers. Environmental conditions were analysed and prediction of remaining service life for chloride induced reinforcement corrosion was performed...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{structures}} are built {{according to the}} valid codes {{at that time and}} reaching their design life time. The traffic loads and traffic intensity has also increased. In addition, the existing reinforced concrete {{structures are}} exposed to degradation mechanisms, like chlorides and carbonation during their lifetime. Existing concrete road infrastructure can have the need to restore the structural performance or the durability. Advanced Ce-mentitious Materials (ACM’s) has the potential for retrofitting due to the increased strength properties and durability. High Performance Concrete (HPC) and especially Ultra-High Performance Fibre Reinforced Concrete (UHPFRC) have increased strength properties and a dense matrix, which prevents the ingress of detrimental substances. Strain Hardening Cementitious Composites (SHCC) has a high tensile strain capacity, whereby the crack widths are limited. The strengthening effect of SHCC retrofitting is negligible. The biggest potential for retrofitting of existing infrastructure with ACM’s is in retrofitting of durability problems. The structural shear strength problems are less severe than originally thought and traditional structural retrofit solutions like FRP lamellas and external prestressing seems to be more feasible and more economic solutions compared to an ACM layer retrofit system. On the other hand, the reinforcement corrosion of concrete structures is expected to increase. Moreover, HPC and UHPFRC both have a dense matrix to prevent the ingress of detrimental substances. SHCC exhibits a large tensile strain capacity and limited crack widths. A specific durability ACM retrofit solution is used in a numerical model (see Figure 1). The durability retrofitting is based on a cast in situ ACM layer on a vertical existing surface, where the time-dependent development of the ACM properties and the interface between the ACM layer and old concrete determine the structural behav-iour. The mechanical properties develop due to the on-going hydration. Shrinkage is the cause of the main stresses in the model and the stresses are partly relaxed by the tensile creep behaviour of the ACM layer. The basic failure modes are debonding of the ACM layer at the free ends and transverse cracking in the ACM layer. A vertical existing surface is used, because vertical surfaces of road infrastructure structures can exhibit dura-bility problems due to de-icing <b>salts</b> in <b>splash</b> water and also tidal zones of marine structures. A parameter study is performed to enhance the understanding of the structural behaviour due to the time-dependent behaviour of the new ACM layer. A thicker ACM layer causes more debonding and transverse crack-ing behaviour, because the total shrinkage displacement is higher which causes higher stresses. A larger shrink-age strain causes higher stresses and more cracking. The creep in the ACM layer causes a stress relaxation. Increased creep compliance results in less severe cracking. The influence of the thickness of the old concrete structure and the length of the ACM retrofitting is limited. A decreased tensile strength and fracture energy of the debonding interface causes a more severe debonding of the ACM layer, because the interface is made weaker. A new ACM layer thickness of 50 mm can be applied without excessive debonding and transverse cracks based on the parameter study of the numerical model. UHPFRC is advised to use for durability retrofitting. It has limited cracking behaviour and a layer of 10 mm is sufficient to prevent the ingress of detrimental substances. The numerical model exhibits in general the expected behaviour. The model has to be improved for a detailed analysis of an ACM retrofit solution. Further research is necessary to the debonding behaviour in the debonding interface. In addition, an experimental program would be necessary to investigate the development of the time-dependent properties of a specific ACM.
