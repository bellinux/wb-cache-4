We {{focus on the}} mobility (<b>sliding</b> <b>vs.</b> fixed), compliance (soft vs. hard), and identity of objects in the environment, as this information could be useful for efficient manipulation and search. By using the large surface area of the forearm, a robot could potentially search and map a cluttered volume more efficiently, and be informed by incidental contact during other manipulation tasks. Our approach tracks a contact region on the forearm over {{time in order to}} generate time series of select features, such as the maximum force, contact area, and contact motion. We then process and reduce the dimensionality of these time series to generate a feature vector to characterize the contact. Finally, we use the k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN) to classify a new feature vector based on a set of previously collected feature vectors. Our results show a high cross-validation accuracy in both classification of mechanical properties and object recognition.

The second section of this paper describes advances in research and theory on the nature of how relationships form, and how aspects of relationship formation may be linked to increased risk for adverse outcomes.

40|$|A model {{describing}} the frictional force produced when a polymer gel is sliding on a solid surface {{has been proposed}} {{from the viewpoint of}} solvated polymer repulsion and adsorption theory at a solid surface. General relations for the frictional force f expressed as functions of the normal loading P, <b>sliding</b> velocity <b>v,</b> the polymer volume fraction Φ, or the elastic modulus E of the gel, etc., have been derived by applying scaling relations to the model. For the repulsive case, f is ascribed to the viscous flow of solvent at the interface and f is theoretically demonstrated to be proportional to the <b>sliding</b> velocity <b>v</b> and the normal pressure P when the pressure is smaller than the elastic modulus of the gel. For the attractive case, in addition to the hydrodynamic friction, the force to detach the adsorbing chain from the substrate appears as friction. When v is not very large, f α v. At an intermediate velocity, f has a velocity dependence less than linear, depending on the strength of adsorption. At a higher sliding velocity, f α v again since the hydrodynamic friction becomes predominant at this stage.

The sensorless control scheme {{is based on a}} high-order sliding mode (HOSM) observer to estimate the DFIG rotational speed. Indeed, high-order sliding mode observers provide theoretically finite time exact state observation and estimation of absolutely continuous unknown inputs. The proposed global control strategy combines an MPPT using a high-order sliding mode speed observer and a high-order sliding mode for the DFIG control. This strategy presents attractive features such as chattering-free behavior, finite reaching time, robustness and unmodeled dynamics (generator and turbine). Simulations using the wind turbine simulator FAST on a 1. 5 -MW three-blade wind turbine are carried out for the validation of the proposed sensorless control strategy.

40|$|Introduction: Cholangiocarcinoma (CC) is a {{malignancy}} of the biliary tract. It has {{a dismal}} prognosis and complete surgical resection offers {{the only chance}} of cure. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify prognostic DNA/microRNA signatures, and to identify key targets and pathways in CC to improve treatment. Methods: We performed a retrospective study to assess the role of surgery and adjuvant therapy on the survival outcomes of patients with CC based on the experience of two institutions. We investigated the molecular pathogenesis of CC assessing DNA copy number alterations and differential miRNA expression. We used array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) (1 Mb BAC array-CGH, and 180 K Oligonucleotide array-CGH) on 71 UK and 24 Thai cases CC. We performed microRNA-arrays (Agilent Human miRNA <b>slides</b> <b>V</b> 3) on 34 CC and 10 normal cholangiocyte samples. Results: Survival analysis showed a statistically significant difference in survival between those resected and those receiving medical management only. Thai CC cases exhibited a lower proportion of CNA compared to UK cases. A common UK alteration was seen at 17 q 12, the region encoding ErbB- 2. The copy number gain at 17 q 12 was validated using CISH and IHC for ErbB- 2 expression, revealing heterogeneous expression. Copy number gain of chromosome 8 q 24. 21 - 24. 3 was significantly related to survival. Median survival was 14. 4 months vs 28. 3 months with and without the gain (p = 0. 016). Thirty-eight miRNAs showed significantly different expression, including several microRNAs implicated in other malignancies, with predicted gene targets including the p 53 signaling pathway and the TGF-beta signaling pathway. We identified a 4 -microRNA signature that correlated with overall survival. With a median survival of 15. 7 months vs 35. 6 months: p = 0. 00016. Conclusion: This study illustrates the genetic variability of CC, highlights several potential therapeutic targets, and identified a DNA and miRNA signature that correlated with prognosis.

One fundamental {{question is how}} these friction effects depend on the local environment and in particular {{on the presence of}} water. In this model study, we use fully atomistic MD simulations with explicit water to obtain friction forces as a single polyglycine peptide chain is pulled out of a bundle of k adhering parallel polyglycine peptide chains. The whole system is periodically replicated along the peptide axes, so a stationary state at prescribed mean <b>sliding</b> velocity <b>V</b> is achieved. The aggregation number is varied between k = 2 (two peptide chains adhering to each other with plenty of water present at the adhesion sites) and k = 7 (one peptide chain pulled out from a close-packed cylindrical array of six neighboring peptide chains with no water inside the bundle). The friction coefficient per hydrogen bond, extrapolated to the viscous limit of vanishing pulling velocity V → 0, exhibits an increase by five orders of magnitude when going from k = 2 to k = 7. This dramatic confinement-induced friction enhancement we argue to be due to a combination of water depletion and increased hydrogen-bond cooperativity...|$|R

In addition, concepts of triggers and long-runout mechanisms of mass movements are loosely applied without rigor. These problems have enormous implications for studies in process sedimentology, sequence stratigraphy, palaeogeography, petroleum geology, and engineering geology. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} critical review is to identify key problems and to provide conceptual clarity and possible solutions. Specific issues are the following: (1) According to “limit equilibrium analyses” in soil mechanics, sediment failure with a sliding motion is initiated over a shear surface when the factor of safety for slope stability (F) is less than 1. However, the term landslide is not meaningful for debris flows with a flowing motion. (2) Sliding motion can be measured in oriented core and outcrop, but such measurement is not practical on seismic profiles or radar images. (3) Although 79 MTD types exist in the geological and engineering literature, only slides, slumps, and debrites are viable depositional facies for interpreting ancient stratigraphic records. (4) The {{use of the}} term landslide for highvelocity debris avalanches is inappropriate because velocities of mass-transport processes cannot be determined in the rock record. (5) Of the 21 potential triggering mechanisms of sediment failures, frequent short-term events that last for only a few minutes to several hours or days (e. g., earthquakes, meteorite impacts, tsunamis, tropical cyclones, etc.) are more relevant in controlling deposition of deep-water sands than sporadic long-term events that last for thousands to millions of years (e. g., sea-level lowstands). (6) The comparison of H/L (fall height/runout distance) ratios of MTD in subaerial environments with H/L ratios of MTD in submarine and extraterrestrial environments is incongruous because of differences in data sources (e. g., outcrop vs. seismic or radar images). (7) Slides represent the pre-transport disposition of strata and their reservoir quality (i. e., porosity and permeability) of the provenance region, whereas debrites reflect post-transport depositional texture and reservoir quality. However, both sandy slides and sandy debrites could generate blocky wireline (gamma-ray) log motifs. Therefore, reservoir characterization of deep-water strata must be based on direct examination of the rocks and related process-specific facies interpretations, not on wireline logs or on seismic profiles and related process-vague facies interpretations. A solution to these problems is to apply the term “landslide” solely to cases in which a sliding motion can be empirically determined. Otherwise, a general term MTD is appropriate. This decree is not just a quibble over semantics; {{it is a matter of}} portraying the physics of mass movements accurately. A precise interpretation of a depositional facies (e. g., sandy <b>slide</b> <b>vs.</b> sandy debrite) is vital not only for maintaining conceptual clarity but also for characterizing petroleum reservoirs...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT [...] A novel dynamic {{friction}} experiment using the Kolsky bar concept was developed. The technique is com-plementary {{to the plate}} impact and other macroscopic friction experiments {{in the sense that}} sliding velocities and pressures not attainable otherwise can be investigated. The experimen-tal results reported in this article show that the technique pro-vides accurate and repeatable measurement of time-resolved friction. The apparatus is simpler and easier to operate than the plate impact facility. However, it cannot achieve the same level of contact pressure. Several material pairs have been investigated. In particular, the kinetic friction coefficient of Ti- 6 AI- 4 <b>V</b> <b>sliding</b> against WC/Co (cerrmet) and 4340 steel sliding against WC/Co were measured and compared with the val-ues reported by Prakash and Clifton in 1993. Atomic force microscopy is used to characterize the surface topography before and after the friction tests. KEY WORDS [...] Kolsky bar, {{dynamic friction}}, manufacturing, wea...|$|R
