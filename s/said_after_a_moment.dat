6000|$|... "I {{can see him}} so plainly," [...] she <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> [...] "Such eyes as he had: big, dark eyes! And such an {{expression}} in them--{{an expression}}!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{been waiting}} for you," [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> [...] "the rest of that lot didn't come in this morning. I've telephoned to the freight agent." ...|$|E
6000|$|She was dressed, and {{had been}} sitting long in quiet meditation. Mrs. Davilow was startled, but <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> reflection-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' he <b>said</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> reflection. 'That's <b>a</b> fine {{idea in the}} abstract; but I {{doubt of}} its {{happiness}} in the long-run.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This," [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> gloomy silence, [...] "is, I believe, {{the young}} gentleman who gained the prize at the {{shooting}} match." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I ought to, sir," [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> with {{pregnant}} gravity. And as we {{were passing}} one of the colleges, [...] "That {{used to be my}} place," [...] he added.|$|E
6000|$|If it {{appeared}} other {{or more than}} this to Mrs. Pasmer, she did not say. She merely <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> [...] "Well, it was certainly devoted, Alice," [...] and let her go.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if you can--?" [...] Mitchy at last broke in. [...] "I don't think, you know," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> [...] "you'll find {{it easy to}} {{make your}} two ends meet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had hoped}} you would wait on some {{chance of being}} able to help us set Archie free," [...] I <b>said</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> hesitation.|$|R
6000|$|... "However," [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> consideration, [...] "why don't {{you take}} a holiday? Some of the other ladies might look <b>after</b> her <b>a</b> while." ...|$|R
6000|$|Bella's voice faltered as she <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> pause, [...] "Dear Elsie never {{recovered}} the shock. She joined {{her husband in}} heaven two months afterwards." ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{she made}} no answer. She <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> [...] "Why have you not been to see me?" [...] He said nothing, and then she went on, [...] "Why don't you answer me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Clementina did {{not look}} {{altogether}} convinced, whether it was Miss Milray's logic or her morality that failed to convince her. She <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> [...] "I should like to see Mr. Gregory again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's made in Germany," [...] Larry <b>said.</b> <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> he added, [...] "Carl got {{it for me}} wholesale. He knows {{some guy}} in the clock business. Otherwise I wouldn't have--" [...] He stopped.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} be {{expected}} to give her up," [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> hesitation: it was not a case for any pretence of generosity.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{that is your}} opinion," [...] Brooks <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> hesitation, [...] "I {{will take}} the steps you suggest, and set myself right at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what may}} that need be?" [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> pause. In his heart he was tempted by the hinted {{opportunity}} of applying his invention.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is an object," [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> [...] "which will by-and-by {{force me}} to leave England for some time--for some years. I have {{purposes}} which will {{take me to the}} East." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Corey did {{not reply}} directly. [...] "Bromfield," [...] she <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of troubled silence, [...] "I have been {{thinking}} over your plan, and I don't see why it isn't the right thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{were only}} just in time," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> or two. [...] "There was snow across the crack and it broke under me. Couldn't crawl out, with my pack {{dragging}} me down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> pause, [...] "whether I {{might say}} {{something}} to you, whether you would listen {{to me for a}} few minutes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Message no use," [...] {{the chief}} <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> thought; [...] "better take him with us, {{may be useful}} by-and-by; may want to send to settlement." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am so very sorry," [...] she <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> startled silence. [...] "I {{am afraid}} that I asked a tactless question, but how could I know?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sorry," [...] she <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> [...] "I--I can't {{make you}} understand. I guess I'm not {{like anybody else}} I'm queer--I can't help it. You must let me go, I only make you unhappy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This will be {{a sudden}} bridal feast!" [...] she <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of pause. [...] "'Tis well that few are invited, or its savor might be spoiled by the Three Hundred! To what convent art thou sent?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Allan hesitated. [...] "I may as {{well tell}} you," [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> [...] "It's {{nothing to be ashamed}} of; I only wonder you haven't noticed it before! There's a woman in it, as usual--I'm in love." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See here, Druse," [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> silence, [...] "it's no use {{making a}} mystery. I order you to report. Was there {{anybody on the}} horse?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Dickory," [...] she <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> silence, [...] "it {{is terrible}} {{about my father}} and Ben Greenway. Why don't they come back? What's the matter with them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “That vessel {{will soon}} be passing us,” I <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment’s</b> pause. “As she is going in the {{opposite}} direction, she is very probably bound for San Francisco.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm glad," [...] Mrs. Kenton <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> [...] "that it isn't Ellen he's after; {{it almost}} reconciles {{me to his}} being with Lottie so much. I only wonder he doesn't take to Ellen, he's so much like that--" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{young girl}} glanced {{over the front}} of her dress and {{smoothed}} out a knot or two of ribbon. Then she rested her eyes upon the prospect again. [...] "Well, I guess you had better leave it somewhere," [...] she <b>said</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... “Would I? Come {{and sit on}} {{the couch}} all the same,” she <b>said</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of hesitation. Then, as I did not move at once, she added with indifference: “You may sit as far away as you like, it’s big enough, {{goodness}} knows.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have three}} uncles," [...] she <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> hesitation,--"Maurice, Ferdinand, and Nicholas. Nicholas lives {{all the time}} in South America. Maurice and Ferdinand are often in Paris." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will turn}} west," [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> thought, [...] "and keep along near {{the foot of}} the hills till we come to another road {{crossing}} them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No!" [...] De Brensault <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> hesitation. [...] "I {{would like}} to delay nothing. I {{would like to}} marry Mademoiselle Jeanne at once, {{if it can be}} arranged." ...|$|R
