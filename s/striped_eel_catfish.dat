50|$|Plotosus lineatus, {{common name}} <b>striped</b> <b>eel</b> <b>catfish,</b> is {{a species of}} eeltail {{catfishes}} belonging to the family Plotosidae.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Striped</b> <b>eel</b> <b>catfish</b> is an oviparous fish; {{this species}} has {{demersal}} eggs and planktonic larvae. This species has evolved long ampullary canals in its electrosensory organs (originally termed [...] "ampullae of Lorenzini").|$|E
50|$|The <b>eel</b> <b>catfish</b> hunts {{both in and}} out of the water, {{having a}} {{different}} method for each. In water, C. apus sucks water and food into its mouth. To catch food on land, the <b>eel</b> <b>catfish</b> lifts the front of its body up, and bends its mouth down on the prey. Its specially adapted spine allows it to do so without weight-bearing pectoral fins.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aquatic fauna}} {{reported}} from the streams consist of 16 species; {{some of these}} species are <b>eel,</b> <b>catfish,</b> gobies, sleepers and snakeheads.|$|R
5000|$|Airbreathing catfish (Clariidae): Amphibious {{species of}} this family may venture onto land in wet weather, such as the <b>eel</b> <b>catfish</b> (Channallabes apus), which lives in swamps in Africa, and is known to hunt beetles on land.|$|R
40|$|The <b>striped</b> <b>eel</b> <b>catfish,</b> Plotosus lineatus (Thunberg, 1787), is {{recorded}} {{for the first}} time from the eastern Mediterranean coast of Israel. Seventeen specimens of this highly-venomous fish were caught by a commercial trawler at depths of 20 m. This species´ occurrence in the Mediterranean is the result of migration from the Red Sea via the Suez Canal (Lessepsian migration) ...|$|E
40|$|Three {{specimens}} of <b>striped</b> <b>eel</b> <b>catfish,</b> Plotosus lineatus (Thunberg, 1787) were caught by a spear gun at depths of 20 m on 4 April 2016 from Iskenderun Bay (Çevlik harbour), Northeastern Mediterranean coast of Turkey. With the present study, P. lineatus {{is the first}} time reported from Turkish marine waters, in the Iskenderun Bay, the Northeastern Mediterranean and also this is the first Plotosid species recorded from Turkish Seas...|$|E
40|$|The Striped Catfish can be {{recognized}} by its striped coloration, barbels around the mouth, and its body shape which tapers to a point posteriorly. Small juveniles are black and large adults may be less distinctly striped. Plotosus lineatus can reach a maximum length of 32 cm (13 in) and about 40 cm in Persian Gulf. The body is brown with cream colored or white longitudinal bands. The most striking feature of this species is in the fins; in fact the second dorsal, caudal and anal are fused together as in eels. In {{the rest of the}} body is quite similar to a freshwater catfish: the mouth is surrounded by four pairs of barbells, four on the upper jaw and four on the lower jaw. The first dorsal and each of the pectoral fins have a highly venomous spine. They may even be fatal. Juveniles of P. lineatus form dense ball-shaped schools of about 100 fish, while adults are solitary or occur in smaller groups of around 20 and are known to hide under ledges during the day. Adult P. lineatus search and stir the sand incessantly for crustaceans, mollusks, worms, and sometimes fish. <b>Striped</b> <b>eel</b> <b>catfish</b> is an oviparous fish; this species has demersal eggs and planktonic larvae. This species has evolved long ampullary canals in its electrosensory organs. Food: Plotosus lineatus eats mainly benthic invertebrates and algae with larger individuals sometimes eating small fishes. Habitat: Plotosus lineatus is an inshore species, inhabiting a variety of habitats, such as lagoons, sandy substrate and coral reefs so Iran (Persian Gulf, Kish Island). It is known as an euryhaline species entering estuaries and even fresh water. P. lineatus occurs in the Indian Ocean, in the western Pacific Ocean and sometimes enters freshwaters in East Africa and Madagascar. The species now also occurs in the Mediterranean, having invaded as a Lessepsian migrant through the Suez Canal...|$|E
50|$|The <b>eel</b> <b>catfish,</b> Channallabes apus, is an airbreathing catfish {{found in}} the muddy swamps of the tropics of western Africa. The fish grows to 32.7 cm long TL (12.9 inches) and is notable for the ability to propel itself {{out of the water}} to catch prey.|$|R
50|$|Gymnallabes nops, {{popularly known}} as the blind <b>eel</b> <b>catfish,</b> is a species of airbreathing catfish found in the lower Congo River basin in the {{countries}} of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo. It is blind, non-pigmented and grows to a length of 5.7 cm SL.|$|R
50|$|The <b>stripe</b> <b>eel,</b> Aprognathodon platyventris, is {{a species}} of eel in the family Ophichthidae. It is {{the only member of}} its genus. It is found in the western Atlantic Ocean from the Florida Keys through the Caribbean islands to Venezuela in reef environments.|$|R
50|$|Within the reserve, {{there are}} 7 species of {{reptiles}} and 8 species of amphibians. The common viper, serpent, and copperhead, along with viviparous lizards {{such as the}} crested newt, all live in the reserve. There are 15 species of fish in the reserve reservoirs. In Lake White <b>eels,</b> <b>catfish,</b> and other species typical of Polissya live. Overall, the fauna portion of the reserve has 221 species of vertebrates.|$|R
40|$|This {{incorporates}} a fresh {{account of the}} latest scientific names and widely used popular and local names of fishes, crustaceans and molluscs commonly occurring in the Maharashtra and Gujarat regions. The 28 different groups includes elasmobranchs, <b>eels,</b> <b>catfishes,</b> clupeoids, bombay duck,lizard fishes, half beaks & fullbeaks, flying fishes, perches, goatfishes, threadfins, croakers, ribbonfishes carangids, silverbellies, big-jawed jumper, pomfrets, mackerels, seer fishes, tunnies, billfishes, barracuda, mullets, unicorn cod, flatfishes, gobies and mudskippers, crustaceans, mollusks...|$|R
50|$|The thin eel-shaped body of C. apus {{is black}} or dark brown, with widely spaced spines. A suprabranchial organ, formed by tree-like {{structures}} {{from the second}} and fourth gill arches, allows the <b>eel</b> <b>catfish</b> to take in oxygen directly from the air for short periods. Its eyes are small and hidden, and it lacks pectoral fins entirely. Like many anguilliform clariids, its jaw muscles are hypertrophic, a modification that {{has been linked to}} increased bite force.|$|R
50|$|The Raystown Branch of the Juniata River is {{accessed}} {{from the}} park for fishing and boating. The river is home to smallmouth and rock bass, carp, sucker, <b>eel,</b> <b>catfish,</b> walleye, and muskellunge. The waters of the river are usually too shallow for motorboating during the summer months, but Raystown Branch is ideal for canoes, rafts and other small boats. All boats must have a current registration with any state. Backflow from the river has created a fresh water swamp that provides habitat for wood ducks, river otter and mallards.|$|R
50|$|The lake {{is popular}} with local anglers, {{containing}} {{a wide variety}} of fresh water fish, such as carp, perch, roach, <b>eel</b> and <b>catfish.</b> Part of the lake has been reserved for the exclusive use of wildlife.|$|R
50|$|The {{reservoir}} is {{stocked with}} Mary River cod, bass, yellowbelly, saratoga and snub nosed gar with endemic populations of tandans (<b>eel</b> tailed <b>catfish)</b> and the introduced spangled perch. A stocked impoundment permit {{is required to}} fish in the dam.|$|R
50|$|The fish {{population}} is primarily {{influenced by the}} angling clubs that lease fishing rights and stock the ponds with fish. Only native species of fish are desired, although <b>eel</b> and <b>catfish</b> are excluded due to their incompatibility with the cray{{fish population}}s.|$|R
50|$|The lake is {{stocked with}} brown trout and rainbow trout, {{but there is}} a large head of coarse fish {{populated}} by water pumped in from the River Welland and River Nene, species include roach, bream, pike, zander, perch, <b>eel,</b> wels <b>catfish</b> and carp.|$|R
50|$|A {{total of}} 27 {{species of fish}} {{have been found in}} the river, {{including}} the glassfish, Pacific Short-finned <b>Eel,</b> blue <b>catfish,</b> milkfish, Fly-specked hardyhead, mouth almighty, Empire gudgeon, barred grunter, barramundi, oxeye herring, mangrove jack, eastern rainbowfish, Bony bream, Freshwater Longtom and Seven-spot Archerfish.|$|R

40|$|In 2002, great flood {{occurred}} in the Římov reservoir. Fish stock of the reservoir was sampled {{before and after the}} flood by night beach seinings, pelagic and benthic gillnets, traps and electrofishing of spawning shoals of common bream. The fluctuations of most species (roach, bream and their hybrid, perch, ruffe, bleak, white bream, asp, pikeperch, <b>eel,</b> <b>catfish)</b> were random and can be attributed to interhabitat migrations rather to the effect of flooding. The share of certain species (carp, tench, goldfish, trout, dace, gudgeon) increased as they were flushed from ponds and fishing grounds in the catchment. Increased share of these species was detected in the spring 2003, while during August, the share of flooded fish decreased near to the usual level. The ‘climax’ cyprinid dominated fish stock proved itself to be very resistant to the extreme flood...|$|R
50|$|In {{the waters}} of Biebrza, there are {{approximately}} 36 species of fish such as pike, Wels <b>catfish,</b> <b>eel,</b> and also typical of the foothills of chub and barbel.|$|R
5000|$|Spawning for the <b>striped</b> cusk <b>eel</b> {{begins in}} the summer. Courting and {{spawning}} rituals include the creation of sound and close, synchronized movements from a breeding pair. Females can release small containers of eggs nightly {{for up to two}} months after the breeding process has finished.|$|R
50|$|The term usually {{refers to}} the {{electric}}ity-generating ability in some aquatic creatures, such as the electric <b>eel,</b> electric <b>catfish,</b> {{and to a lesser}} extent the black ghost knifefish. Fish exhibiting such bioelectrogenesis often also possess electroreceptive abilities (which are more widespread) as part of an integrated electric system. Electrogenesis may be utilized for electrolocation, self-defense, electrocommunication and sometimes the stunning of prey.|$|R
40|$|This study aims {{to compare}} the {{development}} of iguana production systems in Panama {{with the development of}} other new production systems involving non-traditional animal species. Experts on new production systems using pacas, grasscutters, deer, <b>eel,</b> <b>catfish</b> and ostrich were interviewed about their experiences with the development of these systems. The study revealed six key factors for the introduction and development of new production systems. These factors are identified in conditions that are needed to start a new production system, ie the biology of the species, institutional support and the market; and in limitations that can impede the development of new production systems, such as information, social conditions and legislation. Comparing the key factors among production systems, therefore, enables the authors to explore the development of production systems and their prospects and constraints. All key factors were negative for iguana production. If the conditions for iguana production do not change, its development will reach a plateau or even declin...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to obtain the different characteristics of haemoglobin molecules in subjects under hypoxic condition, namely <b>eel,</b> <b>catfish,</b> suckermouth fish, green sea turtle using an electrophoresis technique. We used human umbilical cord blood and thalassemia patient blood, as well as a normal adult-human blood as controls. The proteins obtained after electrophoresis process were stained with two different colouring techniques, each based on different principles. Both staining techniques gave practically identical results. Subject that live in hypoxic condition has a different haemoglobin in comparison to the one found in adult human live in normal oxygen condition (normoxia). These hypoxia-adapted or -needed hemoglobin migrate slower than adult human hemoglobin from normoxia. This observation suggests that hemoglobin which is needed to live in hypoxic condition or environment is a different molecule. Whether this hemoglobin from hypoxic condition has a higher affinity to oxygen is not yet known. Further study is needed to clarify this issue...|$|R
50|$|The <b>striped</b> cusk <b>eel</b> occurs {{from the}} {{northern}} Atlantic waters off the United States, ranging from New England to northeastern Florida. Larvae occupy the continental shelf of the United States, while a mixture of larvae and juveniles {{have been reported to}} occur in estuaries from Barnegat to Chesapeake Bay.|$|R
5000|$|The high {{mountains}} in Kosovo make it ideal for many animals to live in. In {{the rivers and}} lakes there are salmon, trout, scuba, <b>eel,</b> gudgeon, <b>catfish,</b> carp, torpedo and small herring.The southern part, especially the Dragashi municipality has its own dog breed called the Qeni i Sharrit which is kept {{by the majority of}} people living in the country, Western part of the Republic of Macedonia and Albania.|$|R
50|$|<b>Striped</b> {{bass and}} <b>eels</b> also surge {{up the river}} from Raritan Bay and {{encountered}} during Rahway River fishing. Large and very powerful carp appear as well.|$|R
50|$|Vibrio anguillarum is a Gram-negative, curved-rod {{bacterium}} {{with one}} polar flagellum. It {{is an important}} pathogen of cultured salmonid fish, and causes the disease known as vibriosis or red pest of eels. The disease has been observed in salmon, bream, <b>eel,</b> mullet, <b>catfish,</b> and tilapia, amongst others. The organism is most prevalent in late summer in salt or brackish water and transmission is mainly horizontal by direct contact. It is widely distributed across the world.|$|R
50|$|This pelican feeds {{almost entirely}} on fish. Preferred prey species can include common carp (Cyprinus carpio), European perch (Perca fluviatilis), common rudd (Scardinius erythropthalmus), <b>eels,</b> <b>catfish</b> (especially silurids during winter), mullet and {{northern}} pike (Esox lucius), the latter having measured up to 50 cm when taken. In the largest remnant colony, located in Greece, the preferred prey is reportedly the native Alburnus belvica. The Dalmatian pelican requires around 1200 g of fish per day and can take locally abundant smaller fish such as gobies, but usually ignore them in lieu of slightly larger fish. It usually forages alone or in groups of only two or three. It normally swims along, placidly and slowly, until it quickly dunks its head underwater and scoops the fish out, along with great masses of water. The water is dumped out of {{the sides of the}} pouch and the fish is swallowed. Occasionally it may feed cooperatively with other pelicans by corralling fish into shallow waters and may even cooperate similarly while fishing alongside cormorants in Greece. Occasionally, the pelican may not immediately eat the fish contained in its gular pouch, so it can save the prey for later consumption. Other small wetlands-dwellers may supplement the diet, including crustaceans, worms, beetles and small water birds, usually nestlings and eggs.|$|R
5000|$|The fishing villages {{located in}} and around Ennore have for many years {{depended}} on the Creek {{as a source of}} livelihood and sustenance. Owing to the excessive industrial takeover in the region for many years now the number of fish in the creek declined significantly due to the leakage of toxic waste water from factories and the dumping of toxic fly ash. A study by the Aquaculture Foundation of India and three institutions including Anna University, found high concentrations of heavy metals in the water and marine organisms {{in and around}} Ennore creek due to pollution from industries and domestic sources. This study found high levels of heavy metals such as mercury, cadmium and chromium. Species such as flathead grey mullet, a widely eaten fish had levels that hovered close to dangerous limits. Over the years, several commercially valuable fish - including tiger prawn, mud crab, striped crab, sand whiting, silver biddy, cat fish, mackerel, grey <b>eel</b> <b>catfish,</b> croaker and white prawn - have disappeared from the creek. [...] In some areas the depth of the river has become so low, that is it impossible for a small fishing boat to move on it. Fishermen have lost their primary source of income and their lives been reduced to poverty.|$|R
