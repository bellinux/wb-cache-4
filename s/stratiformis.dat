5|$|A {{stratocumulus}} cloud {{is another}} type of a cumuliform or stratocumuliform cloud. Like cumulus clouds, they form at low levels and via convection. However, unlike cumulus clouds, their growth is almost completely retarded by a strong inversion. As a result, they flatten out like stratus clouds, giving them a layered appearance. These clouds are extremely common, covering on average around twenty-three percent of the earth's oceans and twelve percent of the earth's continents. They are less common in tropical areas and commonly form after cold fronts. Additionally, stratocumulus clouds reflect {{a large amount of}} the incoming sunlight, producing a net cooling effect. Stratocumulus clouds can produce drizzle, which stabilizes the cloud by warming it and reducing turbulent mixing. Being a cloud of limited convection, stratocumulus is divided into three species; <b>stratiformis,</b> lenticularis, and castellanus, that are common to the higher stratocumuliform genus-types.|$|E
5|$|Cirrocumulus clouds form in {{patches and}} cannot cast shadows. They {{commonly}} appear in regular, rippling patterns or in rows of clouds with clear areas between. Cirrocumulus are, like {{other members of}} the cumuliform and stratocumuliform categories, formed via convective processes. Significant growth of these patches indicates high-altitude instability and can signal the approach of poorer weather. The ice crystals in the bottoms of cirrocumulus clouds tend to be in the form of hexagonal cylinders. They are not solid, but instead tend to have stepped funnels coming in from the ends. Towards the top of the cloud, these crystals have a tendency to clump together. These clouds do not last long, and they tend to change into cirrus because as the water vapor continues to deposit on the ice crystals, they eventually begin to fall, destroying the upward convection. The cloud then dissipates into cirrus. Cirrocumulus clouds come in four species which are common to all three genus-types that have limited-convective or stratocumuliform characteristics: <b>stratiformis,</b> lenticularis, castellanus, and floccus. They are iridescent when the constituent supercooled water droplets are all about the same size.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} for some species to show combined varieties at one time, especially if one variety is opacity-based {{and the other is}} pattern-based. An example of this would be a layer of altocumulus <b>stratiformis</b> arranged in seemingly converging rows separated by small breaks. The full technical name of a cloud in this configuration would be altocumulus <b>stratiformis</b> radiatus perlucidus, which would identify respectively its genus, species, and two combined varieties.|$|E
2500|$|Another variety, {{duplicatus}} (closely spaced {{layers of}} the same type, one above the other), is sometimes found with cirrus of both the fibratus and uncinus species, and with altocumulus and stratocumulus of the species <b>stratiformis</b> and lenticularis. [...] The variety undulatus (having a wavy undulating base) can occur with any clouds of the species <b>stratiformis</b> or lenticularis, and with altostratus. [...] It is only rarely observed with stratus nebulosus. The variety lacunosus is caused by localized downdrafts that create circular holes {{in the form of}} a honeycomb or net. [...] It is occasionally seen with cirrocumulus and altocumulus of the species <b>stratiformis,</b> castellanus, and floccus, and with stratocumulus of the species <b>stratiformis</b> and castellanus.|$|E
2500|$|Stratocumuliform genus-types (cirrocumulus, altocumulus, and stratocumulus) {{that appear}} in mostly stable air have two species each. [...] The <b>stratiformis</b> species {{normally}} occur in extensive sheets or in smaller patches where there is only minimal convective activity. Clouds of the lenticularis species tend to have lens-like shapes tapered at the ends. They are most commonly seen as orographic mountain-wave clouds, but can occur anywhere in the troposphere where there is strong wind shear combined with sufficient airmass stability to maintain a generally flat cloud structure. [...] These two species {{can be found in}} the high, middle, or low level of the troposphere depending on the stratocumuliform genus or genera present at any given time.|$|E
2500|$|All cloud {{varieties}} {{fall into}} one of two main groups. [...] One group identifies the opacities of particular low and mid-level cloud structures and comprises the varieties translucidus (thin translucent), perlucidus (thick opaque with translucent or very small clear breaks), and opacus (thick opaque). [...] These varieties are always identifiable for cloud genera and species with variable opacity. [...] All three are associated with the <b>stratiformis</b> species of altocumulus and stratocumulus. [...] However, only two varieties are seen with altostratus and stratus nebulosus whose uniform structures prevent the formation of a perlucidus variety. [...] Opacity-based varieties are not applied to high clouds because they are always translucent, {{or in the case of}} cirrus spissatus, always opaque. [...] Similarly, these varieties are also not associated with moderate and towering vertical clouds because they are always opaque.|$|E
2500|$|A {{second group}} {{describes}} the occasional arrangements of cloud structures into particular patterns that are discernible by a surface-based observer (cloud fields usually being visible {{only from a}} significant altitude above the formations). These varieties are not always present with the genera and species {{with which they are}} otherwise associated, but only appear when atmospheric conditions favor their formation. Intortus and vertebratus varieties occur on occasion with cirrus fibratus. [...] They are respectively filaments twisted into irregular shapes, and those that are arranged in fishbone patterns, usually by uneven wind currents that favor the formation of these varieties. [...] The variety radiatus is associated with cloud rows of a particular type that appear to converge at the horizon. [...] It is sometimes seen with the fibratus and uncinus species of cirrus, the <b>stratiformis</b> species of altocumulus and stratocumulus, the mediocris and sometimes humilis species of cumulus, and with the genus altostratus.|$|E
5000|$|Pattern-based varieties: Radiatus (arranged in {{parallel}} bands) is sometimes {{seen with the}} stratformis and castellanus species. Altocumulus <b>stratiformis</b> radiatus of any opacity is coded CM5 if it is increasing in amount. The duplicatus or undulatus varieties are occasionally seen with the <b>stratiformis</b> and lenticularis species. [...] Altocumulus <b>stratiformis</b> duplicatus is coded CM7 {{if it is not}} overridden by another coding of higher importance. Lacunosus is very occasionally associated with altocumulus of the species <b>stratiformis,</b> castellanus, or floccus.|$|E
5000|$|Cirrocumulus <b>stratiformis</b> {{is a type}} of {{cirrocumulus}} cloud. The name cirrocumulus <b>stratiformis</b> {{is derived}} from Latin, meaning [...] "stretched out". Cirrocumulus <b>stratiformis</b> occurs as very small cirrocumulus clouds that cover {{a large part of the}} sky. This type of cloud always occurs in thin layers.

50|$|Hand {{labor is}} a key theme in <b>Stratiformis.</b> The {{salvaged}} knitting machines bear traces of wear by their operators, and the artist left bits of stray yarn and thread connected {{to some of the}} machine parts to evoke a sense of warmth associated with knit goods. The steel is hand-welded to assure longevity. The galvanized and copper wires were hand-wrapped and then hand-filed. A sealant is applied by hand at regular intervals to prevent excessive rust. <b>Stratiformis</b> is related to Kim's larger body of work, which references memory, cultural identity, and healing.|$|E
50|$|Opacity-based varieties: Altocumulus <b>stratiformis</b> {{has three}} opacity-based varieties; Translucidus (CM3), {{perlucidus}} (CM3 or 7 depending on predominant opacity), and opacus (CM7). Varieties based on opacity are not commonly associatied with the species lenticularis, castellanus, or floccus.|$|E
50|$|Genitus Mother clouds: Altocumulus <b>stratiformis</b> cumulogenitus or cumulonimbogenitus {{can form}} when the middle or {{upper part of}} a towering free {{convective}} cloud begins to spread horizontally due {{to a loss of}} convective lift. It is coded CM6.|$|E
50|$|Mother clouds: This genus type has no {{recognized}} genitus mother clouds. However cirrocumulus <b>stratiformis</b> cirromutatus or cirrostratomutatus {{can result}} from sheets or filaments of high cloud taking on a stratocumuliform structure {{as a result of}} high altitude convection. A high layer of white or light grey altocumulus of a particular species can thin out into pure white cirrocumulus altocumulomutatus of the same species.|$|E

Local art critics have derided the sculpture as a “jerry-rigged contraption," [...] a “brown smudge," [...] and “Stratiformless." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Stratiformis</b> is {{a public}} artwork by Korean-born artist Jin Soo Kim located in Catalano Square, which is south of {{downtown}} in the Historic Third Ward of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States. The large sculpture combines disassembled knitting machines culled from a local apparel manufacturer in a grid of rusted rebar, all hand-wrapped with galvanized and copper wire. It was installed in 2006.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Stratiformis</b> is {{responding}} to the local labor history of the Historic Third Ward. Reliable Knitting Works was a knitting company that created wool hats, gloves and hockey stockings. It was the last company to create these goods in the United States. The company and its president, Isabelle Prolacheck, were instrumental in creating the characteristics of The Historic Third Ward, {{as we know it}} today. It was once at risk of becoming a red light district. Prolacheck donated old knitting machines for this project.|$|E
5000|$|Species: Cirrocumulus <b>stratiformis</b> (Cc str) {{is one of}} four {{species and}} appears in the form of {{relatively}} flat stratocumuliform sheets or patches. The species lenticularis (Cc len) takes its name from the lens-shaped structure of this cloud which is tapered at each end. Cirrocumulus castellanus (Cc cas) has cumuliform buildups that give the cloud a partly or mainly turreted appearance. When the cumuliform parts have more of a tufted appearance, it is given the species name floccus (Cc flo). [...] Cirrocumulus with castellanus buildups can show some vertical extent, but are not usually classified as vertical or multi-étage clouds.|$|E

5000|$|To create <b>Stratiformis,</b> Kim led {{processes}} {{related to}} research, fabrication, and installation. She {{took up residence}} and a studio in Milwaukee and collaborated extensively. Students from MIAD assisted with research on the local community and area businesses of the present and past. They also worked with Kim in the studio. According to Kim, the collaboration of MIAD students as an “integral {{part of the original}} process." [...] During the weeks prior to the dedication, Kim and several students moved their studio practice out to the sculpture’s site. According to Kim, “People were puzzled and fascinated that it was literally being tied together by hand." [...] The sculpture was dedicated on May 3, 2006.|$|E
