40|$|The current {{laboratory}} {{methods for}} assessing the vibration attenuation performance of seats involve repetitive trials {{with a number of}} human occupants, and raise certain ethical concerns. Moreover, the measurements with human subjects yield considerable variability in the data. Alternatively, several anthropodynamic manikins have been developed for effective assessments of the coupled seat occupant system [1]. The effectiveness of a manikin in predicting the response of a coupled seat-occupant system lies in its ability to reproduce the biodynamic response of the seated human body in terms of force-motion relationship at the body-seat interface, such as apparent mass (APMS). A number of prototype manikins have thus been developed on the basis of biodynamic characteristics of vertical vibration-exposed seated occupants of different body masses in the vicinity of 5 th, 50 th and 95 th percentile male population. This study concerns with the analysis of a passive prototype manikin to enhance its ability to reproduce the idealized APMS response characteristics of the vibration-exposed seated human subjects defined in ISO- 5982 [2] for mean body masses of 55, 75 and 98 kg. Methods The APMS responses of a prototype anthropodynamic passive manikin were thoroughly characterized in the laboratory under different excitations and body mass configurations. The manikin was designed with sufficient flexibility to configure mechanical-equivalent models corresponding to seated body masses of 55, 75 and 98 kg, by adding/removing specified masses and springs (Fig. 1). The manikin, configured for a specific body mass, was positioned on a rigid seat without a backrest, which was fixed to the force platform of a whole-body vertical vibration simulator. The simulator was programmed to synthesize random vertical vibration with flat acceleration power spectrum in the 0. 4 - 20 Hz frequency range with two different magnitudes: 1 and 2 m/s 2 overall rms acceleration. The total static and dynamic forces of the manikin to and the seat were measured using the force platform, while a single axis accelerometer was installed on the seat pan to measure acceleration due to vertical excitation. The measured data was appropriately corrected for the rigid <b>seat</b> <b>inertia</b> <b>force,</b> and the apparent mass [...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{investigated}} {{whether a}} lack of <b>inertia</b> <b>force</b> of late systolic aortic flow and/or apical asynergy provoke early diastolic dysfunction in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). BackgroundLeft ventricular (LV) isolated diastolic dysfunction is a well-recognized cause of heart failure. MethodsWe evaluated LV apical wall motion and obtained left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by left ventriculography in 101 patients who underwent cardiac catheterization to assess CAD. We also computed the LV relaxation time constant (Tp) and the <b>inertia</b> <b>force</b> of late systolic aortic flow from the LV pressure (P) –first derivative of left ventricular pressure (dP/dt) relation. Using color Doppler echocardiography, we measured the propagation velocity of LV early diastolic filling flow (Vp). Patients with LVEF ≥ 50 % (preserved systolic function [PSF], n = 83) were divided into 2 subgroups: patients with <b>inertia</b> <b>force</b> (n = 53) and without <b>inertia</b> <b>force</b> (n = 30). No patient with systolic dysfunction (SDF) (LVEF < 50 %) had <b>inertia</b> <b>force</b> (n = 18). ResultsThe Tp was significantly longer in patients with SDF (85. 7 ± 21. 0 ms) and with PSF without <b>inertia</b> <b>force</b> (81. 1 ± 23. 6 ms) than in those with PSF with <b>inertia</b> <b>force</b> (66. 3 ± 12. 8 ms) (p< 0. 001). The Vp was significantly less in the former 2 groups than in the last group. In patients with PSF, LV apical wall motion abnormality was less frequently observed in those with <b>inertia</b> <b>force</b> than in those without (p < 0. 0001). ConclusionsAn absence of <b>inertia</b> <b>force</b> in patients with PSF {{is one of the}} causes of isolated diastolic dysfunction in patients with CAD. Normal LV apical wall motion is substantial enough to give inertia to late systolic aortic flow...|$|R

40|$|Ten years ago, an {{original}} semi-recursive formulation for the dynamic simulation of large-scale multibody systems was presented by García de Jalón et al. By {{taking advantage of}} the cut-joint and rod-removal techniques through a double-step velocity transformation, this formulation proved to be remarkably efficient. The rod-removal technique was employed, primarily, {{to reduce the number of}} differential and constraint equations. As a result, <b>inertia</b> and external <b>forces</b> were applied to neighboring bodies. Those <b>inertia</b> <b>forces</b> depended on unknown accelerations, a fact that contributed to the complexity of the system inertia matrix. In search of performance improvement, this paper presents an approximation of rod-related <b>inertia</b> <b>forces</b> by using accelerations from previous time-steps.
