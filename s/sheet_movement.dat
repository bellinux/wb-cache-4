Molecular mechanisms that regulate this <b>sheet</b> <b>movement</b> have been largely unknown, although cell locomotion or movement mechanisms for individual cells, such as for fibroblastic cells, have been extensively studied [3 – 5]. Here, we show that, during wound healing, sheets of MDCK {{epithelial cell}}s migrate coordinately as a unit, and wound-induced activation of ERK MAP kinase (ERK 1 / 2) propagates in cell sheets {{in accordance with the}} cell <b>sheet</b> <b>movement.</b> Inhibition of ERK 1 / 2 activation by specific MEK inhibitors or by expressing dominant-negative ERK 2 results in marked inhibition of the <b>sheet</b> <b>movement</b> during wound healing, and inhibition of the cell <b>sheet</b> <b>movement</b> by disrupting actin cytoskeleton suppresses propagation of ERK 1 / 2 activation. These results indicate that cell movement and ERK 1 / 2 activation form a positive feedback loop, which facilitates cell sheet migration. Moreover, we find that Src family kinase inhibitors suppress both cell migration and propagation of ERK 1 / 2 activation, suggesting that Src family kinase may participate in this feedback loop. Interestingly, neither cell sheet migration as a unit nor migration-dependent propagation of ERK 1 / 2 activation occurs during wound healing in fibroblastic 3 Y 1 cells. Thus, our results identify specific requirements of ERK 1 / 2 MAP kinase for epithelial cell <b>sheet</b> <b>movement...</b>|$|E

Further, hep is required for expression in the dorsal epithelium edges of another dorsal closure gene, puckered.

Dorsal closure is characterized by complex cell <b>sheet</b> <b>movements,</b> driven by multiple tissue specific forces, which are coordinated in space, synchronized in time, and resilient to UV-laser perturbations. The mechanisms responsible for these attributes are not fully understood. We measured spatial, kinematic, and dynamic antero-posterior asymmetries to biophysically characterize both resiliency to laser perturbations and failure of closure in mutant embryos and compared them to natural asymmetries in unperturbed, wild-type closure. We quantified and mathematically modeled two processes that are upregulated to provide resiliency—contractility of the amnioserosa and formation of a seam between advancing epidermal sheets, i. e., zipping. Both processes are spatially removed from the laser-targeted site, indicating {{they are not a}} local response to laser-induced wounding and suggesting mechanosensitive and/or chemosensitive mechanisms for upregulation. In mutant embryos, tissue junctions initially fail at the anterior end indicating inhomogeneous mechanical stresses attributable to head involution, another developmental process that occurs concomitant with the end stages of closure. Asymmetries in these mutants are reversed compared to wild-type, and inhomogeneous stresses may cause asymmetries in wild-type closure...|$|R
40|$|Superficial injury {{involving}} the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract heals {{by a process}} termed restitution that involves epithelial <b>sheet</b> <b>movement</b> into the damaged area. The forces that drive epithelial <b>sheet</b> <b>movement</b> are only partially understood, although it is known to involve changes in the morphology of cells bordering the damage, such as the formation of large, flat, cytoplasmic extensions termed lamellae. We investigated the mechanism of epithelial <b>sheet</b> <b>movement</b> by following {{the response of the}} actin cytoskeleton and specific integrins (alpha 6 beta 4, alpha 6 beta 1, and alpha 3 beta 1) to wounding. To model this event in vitro, monolayers of T 84 cells, well-differentiated colon carcinoma cells, were damaged by aspiration and the ensuing response was analyzed by a combination of time-lapse video microscopy, fluorescence confocal microscopy and antibody inhibition assays. We show that wound healing begins with retraction of the monolayer. alpha 6 beta 4 integrin is localized on the basal surface in structures referred to as type II hemidesmosomes that persist throughout this early stage. We hypothesize that these structures adhere to the substrate and function to retard retraction. Once retraction ceases, the wound is contracted initially by actin purse strings and then lamellae. Purse strings and lamellae produce a pulling force on surrounding cells, inducing them to flatten into the wound. In the case of lamellae, we detected actin suspension cables that appear to transduce this pulling force. As marginal cells produce lamellae, their basal type II hemidesmosomes disappear and the alpha 6 integrins appear evenly distributed over lamellae surfaces. Antibodies directed against the alpha 6 subunit inhibit lamellae formation, indicating that redistribution of the alpha 6 integrins may contribute to the protrusion of these structures. Antibodies directed against the alpha 3 beta 1 integrin also reduce the size and number of lamellae. This integrin 2 ̆ 7 s contribution to lamellae extension is most likely related to its localization at the leading edge of emerging protrusions. In summary, wounds in epithelial sheets initially retract, and then are contracted by first an actin purse string and then lamellae, both of which serve to pull the surrounding cells into the denuded area. The alpha 6 integrins, particularly alpha 6 beta 4, help contain retraction and both the alpha 6 integrins and alpha 3 beta 1 integrin contribute to lamellae formation...|$|E

We have also investigated how CKA acts. This unique molecule forms a complex with HEP (DJNKK), BSK (DJNK), DJUN, and DFOS. Complex formation activates BSK kinase, which in turn phosphorylates and activates DJUN and DFOS.

Such embryos show defects in the elongation of the dorsal-most epidermal cells as well as in the actomyosin cable assembly at the leading edge.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the genes that {{interact}} with Ras signaling pathways to regulate morphogenesis. The synthesis of dorsal eggshell structures in Drosophila melanogaster requires multiple rounds of Ras signaling followed by dramatic epithelial <b>sheet</b> <b>movements.</b> We took advantage of this process to identify genes that link patterning and morphogenesis; we screened lethal mutations on the second chromosome for those that could enhance a weak Ras 1 eggshell phenotype. Of 1618 lethal P-element mutations tested, 13 showed significant enhancement, resulting in forked and fused dorsal appendages. Our genetic and molecular analyses together with information from the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project reveal that 11 of these lines carry mutations in previously characterized genes. Three mutations disrupt the known Ras 1 cell signaling components Star, Egfr, and Blistered, while one mutation disrupts Sec 61 beta, implicated in ligand secretion. Seven lines represent cell signaling and cytoskeletal components that are new to the Ras 1 pathway; these are Chickadee (Profilin), Tec 29, Dreadlocks, POSH, Peanut, Smt 3, and MESK 2, a suppressor of dominant-negative Ksr. A twelfth insertion disrupts two genes, Nrk, a "neurospecific" receptor tyrosine kinase, and Tpp, which encodes a neuropeptidase. These results suggest that Ras 1 signaling during oogenesis involves novel components that may be intimately associated with additional signaling processes and with the reorganization of the cytoskeleton. To determine whether these Ras 1 Enhancers function upstream or downstream of the Egf receptor, four mutations were tested for their ability to suppress an activated Egfr construct (lambdatop) expressed in oogenesis exclusively in the follicle cells. Mutations in Star and l(2) 43 Bb had no significant effect upon the lambdatop eggshell defect whereas smt 3 and dock alleles significantly suppressed the lambdatop phenotype...|$|R
40|$|The major {{cellular}} {{function of}} ROCK 1 is to regulate cell morphology, largely through {{the regulation of}} actin–myosin and intermediate filaments. As a result, ROCK 1 directly influences several cellular activities, such as contraction, cytokinesis, adhesion, motility, endothelial barrier function, and membrane blebbing; it also indirectly influences processes such as gene transcription, proliferation, cell size, and survival. The wide range of processes influenced by ROCK 1 means that it is involved in many physiological functions (such as neuronal morphogenesis, smooth muscle contraction, immune cell chemotaxis, and epithelial <b>sheet</b> <b>movements)</b> and in pathophysiological conditions (such as tumor cell metastasis, hypertension, vasospasm, bronchial asthma, and glaucoma). ROCK 1 has a paralog in ROCK 2, which has 65 % identity overall with the highest degree of similarity in their kinase domains with 92 % identity. Although prokaryotes have two ROCK paralogs, eukaryotes such as Drosophila melanogaster (DRok) and Caenorhabditis elegans (LET- 502) have only a ROCK 2 homolog, suggesting {{that it is the}} ancestral form. Interestingly, genetic evidence from these organisms indicates that these ancestral versions are involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeletal structures, cell morphology and motility. Much of the research that has been undertaken to identify ROCK substrates has made use of ROCK 2; it has been generally assumed that the same proteins are also ROCK 1 substrates. It has been determined that ROCK 1, but not ROCK 2, is negatively regulated by Rnd 3 /RhoE and Gem, and to be caspase-cleaved and activated during apoptosis. Functionally, ROCK 1 might have a more significant function in regulating the actin–myosin cytoskeleton and phagocytosis, possibly as a result of differences in phosphatidylinositol lipid binding and subcellular localization.
