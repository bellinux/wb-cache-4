40|$|The African Sahel {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{vulnerable}} regions to climate variability at different time scales. It is an arid to semi-arid region with limited water resources. The summer rainfall {{is one of the}}se sources, but it exhibits pronounced interannual variability. This thesis presents several aspects of Sahelian Sudan rainfall. Sudan is located at the eastern fringe of the Sahel and its least studied part. We have examined the impact of tropical deforestation on the rainfall, the moisture sources of the region and the temporal characteristics of the observed and modeled rainfall. In a sensitivity study we performed three simulations, one control simulation and then setting the surface condition of South <b>Sudan</b> to either <b>grass</b> or desert conditions. The rainfall was reduced by 0. 1 − 0. 9 in the grass scenario and by 0. 1 − 2. 1 mm day− 1 (hereafter mm d− 1) in the desert scenario. These changes also propagated northward into Sahelian Sudan, indicating a remote impact. The total moisture convergence into Sahelian Sudan was reduced by 11. 5 % and 21. 9 % for grass and desert conditions, respectively. The change in moisture convergence into the region motivated a comprehensive analysis of the moisture sources for the region. Two different modeling approaches, Lagrangian and Eulerian, were applied to identify the moisture sources and quantify their contributions to the total annual rainfall budget. The analysis shows that atmospheric flows associated with the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), e. g. from Guinea Coast, Central African and Western Sahel, brings about 40 % − 50 % of the annual moisture supply, while local evaporation adds about 20 %. The rest of the moisture comes from the Mediterranean, Arabian Peninsula and the Southern part of the Indian Ocean. While there were differences in the details between the results from the two modeling approaches, they agree on the larger scale results. In an attempt to characterize the temporal character of the rainfall, observed and modeled daily rainfall from different regional climate models was classified into five categories: weak (0. 1 − 1. 0), moderate (> 1. 0 − 10. 0), moderately strong (> 10. 0 − 20. 0), strong (> 20. 0 − 30. 0), and very strong (> 30. 0) mm d− 1. We found that most rain-days were in the weak to moderate rainfall categories, accounting for 60 % − 75 %. Days that have strong rainfall represent about 6 % of the total rain-days, yet they represent about 28 % − 48 % of the total amount of the annual rainfall. Regional climate models fail to produce the strong rainfall, instead most of the modeled rain-days are in the moderate category and consequently the models overestimated the number of rain-days per year.

The spreader, Dane Lindemeir, remembers objecting to the spreading {{of what he was}} told was a mix of fertilizer, atrazine, and trifluralin, because it didn't look healthy and it didn't make sense to apply both atrazine, which kills beans, and trifluralin, which kills corn, together (28). Later that year, Cenex salesman Nerpel, a friend of DeYoung, tells DeYoung that he should check into the fertilizer. The corn planted hardly grew, and what was grown was sold as animal feed. DeYoung, worried about the liability of the toxic waste, tries to get Cenex to take over the land, which they reluctantly do. Cenex plants <b>Sudan</b> <b>grass,</b> known for soaking up heavy metals, but the [...] "extremely rank stand" [...] of <b>Sudan</b> <b>grass</b> only covers 22 percent of the land (41). Although Cenex claims it will not sell the grass, its Quincy manager John Williams sells it to a neighbor for her horses. Several of the horses die. Meanwhile, DeYoung hires lawyers, but does not make much headway against Cenex, which has the state government on its side (53). Another farmer purchasing from Cenex, Tom Witte, finds that his fields yielded substantially less, and his cows begin getting cancer. His field man gets muscular dystrophy, and in 1991 he files for bankruptcy.|$|E
50|$|Peronosclerospora sorghi has a broad host range, {{particularly}} {{plants in}} the sorghum family. These host plants include Sorghum bicolor, or sorghum, Sorghum sudanense, or <b>Sudan</b> <b>grass,</b> and Sorghum palepense, or Johnsongrass. Its hosts also include Pinnisetum glaucum, or pearl millet, and Zea mays, or maize. When maize plants are infected as seedlings, the first symptom to appear is chlorosis of the leaves. As the plant grows, it often shows stunting, and necrotic lesions begin to form on the leaves. As the leaves continue to grow, a white, downy growth may develop in the necrotic lesions, especially {{on the underside of}} the leaves. This downy growth is the result of the production of conidia and conidiophores under the proper environmental conditions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{approach}} {{relies on}} a combination of companion crops to be planted around and among maize or sorghum. Both domestic and wild grasses can help to protect the crops by attracting and trapping the stemborers. The grasses are planted in the border around the maize and sorghum fields where invading adult moths become attracted to chemicals emitted by the grasses themselves. Instead of landing on the maize or sorghum plants, the insects head for {{what appears to be a}} tastier meal. These grasses provide the [...] "pull" [...] in the [...] "push-pull" [...] strategy. They also serve as a haven for the borers' natural enemies. Good trap crops include well-known grasses such as Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) and <b>Sudan</b> <b>grass</b> (Sorghum vulgare sudanense). Napier grass has a particularly effective way of defending itself against the pests: once attacked by a borer larva, it secretes a sticky substance which physically traps the pest and limits its damage.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundIn recent years, several {{plant species}} {{have been used as}} bioindicators to {{evaluate}} the toxicity of environmental contaminants on vegetal organisms. In this study, Egyptian clover and <b>Sudan</b> <b>grass</b> seedlings were grown in four cadmium (Cd) concentration levels (0. 0, 25, 50 and 100 µM) in MS media to analyze growth responses, Cd accumulation in the shoots and roots of plantlets, proline contents, chlorophylls content and MDA levels of both plantlets. As well as RAPD analysis and leaves ultrastructure were detected. ResultsThe results showed that there was a significant decrease in root and shoot lengths, Chl a, Chl b, total Chl and carotenoids contents for both Egyptian clover and <b>Sudan</b> <b>grass.</b> However, there was a significant increase in Cd accumulation, proline and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels.

The treatments used were pure stand, a mixture of Clitoria, lablab and <b>Sudan</b> <b>grass,</b> phosphorus fertilizer and Rhizobium inoculation. They were laid out in a completely randomized block design with three replications. Growth attributes, number of nodules, weight of nodules and prussic acid (HCN) were measured. Results showed that stem thickness was significantly affected by intercropping and addition of phosphorus. Sole crops produced forage with thicker stems during the growth of the first crop, while intercropped plants treated with phosphorus developed thicker stems during the second cut (ratoon). The plant cover was significantly higher for Clitoria than the other species. Intercropping and addition of phosphorus increased plant height of <b>Sudan</b> <b>grass.</b> The leaf area of Clitoria was increased with the addition of phosphorus and intercropping in the first crop, but sole Clitoria scored higher leaf area during the second cut.

Although sweet sorghum and <b>sudan</b> <b>grass</b> obviously behaved as chilling‐sensitive plants, a considerable variation for chilling susceptibility was observed among the different genotypes tested. Some sweet sorghum varieties, such as ‘Dale’ and ‘Keller’, and most of the <b>sudan</b> <b>grass</b> varieties appeared to possess a certain degree of resistance towards low temperature stress, indicating the existence of useful germplasms in Sorghum for improving stress tolerance.

A total of 80, 686 unigenes were obtained via de novo assembly of the clean reads including 45, 065 unigenes (55. 9 %) that were identified as coding sequences (CDSs). According to Gene Ontology analysis, 31, 444 unigenes were annotated, 11, 778 unigenes were identified to 25 categories in the clusters of orthologous groups of proteins (KOG) classification, and 11, 223 unigenes were assigned to 280 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Additionally, there were 2, 329 DEGs under a short-term of 25 % polyethylene glycol (PEG) treatment, while 5, 101 DEGs were identified under the long-term of 25 % PEG treatment. DEGs were enriched in pathways of carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms and plant hormone signal transduction which {{played a leading role}} in short-term of drought stress.

40|$|This {{research}} {{studied the}} phenotypic correlation coefficients between three Sorghum species, namely forage sorghum S. bicolor Moench. (c. NS-Džin), <b>Sudan</b> <b>grass</b> S. sudanense L. (c. Zora) and interspecies hybrid S. bicolor x S. sudanense (c. Siloking). The {{analyses were performed}} on plant material samples taken from the first cutting, when plants were in the beginning phase of tasseling. The following morphologic traits were studied: plant height, number of leaves per plant, stem leaf weight and mean stem weight. Additionally, their direct and indirect effect on dependent variable green biomass yield was analyzed, for which path coefficients were calculated. This method enables more quality and full insight into relations existing among the studied traits, more precise establishment of cause-effect connections among them, {{as well as to}} separate direct from indirect effects of any particular trait on dependent variable, being biomass yield in this case. The analysis of phenotypic coefficients revealed differences in direct and indirect effect of certain traits on dependent variable. <b>Sudan</b> <b>grass</b> had the highest stem (2. 281 m) and most leaves per plant (7. 917). Forage sorghum had the largest leaf weight per plant (49. 05 g), while interspecies hybrid had the highest mean stem weight (80. 798 g). Variations of these morphologic traits among species were found to be significant and very significant. Morphologic traits - stem height and weight significantly affected sorghum green biomass yield. Leaf number and leaf portion in total biomass were negatively correlated with yield. Cultivars differed significantly regarding morphologic and productive traits. <b>Sudan</b> <b>grass</b> had the lowest green biomass yield, while forage sorghum and interspecies hybrid had significant yield increase...|$|E

The object {{of this study was}} a two-year trial (2009 and 2010) regarding variability of morphological {{characteristics of}} species belonging to Sorghum genus, more specifically interspecies hybrid between sorghum and <b>Sudan</b> <b>grass</b> Siloking as affected by different applications of nitrogen. The following morphological characteristics were analysed: plant height, number of leaves, leaf ratio, stem ratio, and number of shoots. Samples were taken from the first cut when the effect of the applied nitrogen doses was the strongest. The results showed that increasing nitrogen quantities significantly affected the tested morphological characteristics, especially the intensity of tillering (increased number of secondary stems), number of the formed leaves, and ratio of leaf weight in the total above-ground biomass. The effect of applied nitrogen depended on the weather conditions, i. e. distribution of precipitation, so that plants reached maximum height when 105 kg N ha- 1 was applied in the dry year and 180 kg N ha- 1 in the wet year...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of ash from the Dobrotvir {{thermal power plant}} dumps and potassium humate "STB- 45 " on the phytotoxicity of the rock dumps substrate of coal mines in Chervonograd mining region has been researched. <b>Sudan</b> <b>grass</b> Sorghum bicolor subsp. drummondii (Nees ex Steud.) {{has been used as}} a biotester. The increase of the stem height, leaf area, length and mass of roots under the {{influence of}} the addition of ash dumps to the substrate has been discovered. Application of the humate only has increased just the leaf area and the mass of roots. Adding ash with humate significantly increased the value of all the studied morphometric parameters and the influence on the mass of roots was more effective than under the use of the ash only. It has been found out that adding humate increases chlorophyll a in leaves. Adding ash and humate with ash demonstrated increasing chlorophyll a together with the simultaneous reduction of feofityn a. Increased values of morphometric parameters of the <b>Sudan</b> <b>grass,</b> increase of chlorophyll content, combined with the reduction of feofityn, indicates the reduction of stress for plants, caused by phytotoxicity. It has been discovered that the use of coal ash from thermal power plants together with potassium Gumat "STB- 45 " for reducing phytotoxicity of dumps is more effective than the use of just one of the meliorants...|$|E

The aim of this research was to study the effect of organic mulches on sesame productivity and in situ moisture conservation. This experiment was carried out in Humera Agricultural Research Center, Western Tigray, during 2015 growing season. The experimental design was Randomized Complete Block Design with three replications. There were four types of organic mulches; rice straw, sorghum straw, sesame straw, and <b>Sudan</b> <b>grass</b> were compared with control. Sesame, variety Setit- 1 was used in the experiment. The organic mulching rate of application was 10 ton ha− 1 and this was applied evenly to the soil immediately after germination.
