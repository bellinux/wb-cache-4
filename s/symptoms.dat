5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} {{should be}} suspected {{if any of}} the <b>symptoms</b> associated with the condition occurs following a drop in pressure, in particular, within 24 hours of diving. In 1995, 95% of all cases reported to Divers Alert Network had shown <b>symptoms</b> within 24 hours. An alternative diagnosis should be suspected if severe <b>symptoms</b> begin more than six hours following decompression without an altitude exposure or if any symptom occurs more than 24 hours after surfacing. The diagnosis is confirmed if the <b>symptoms</b> are relieved by recompression. Although MRI or CT can frequently identify bubbles in DCS, they are not as good at determining the diagnosis as a proper history of the event and description of the <b>symptoms.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dependent stage – At this stage, <b>symptoms</b> {{build up}} gradually. Hangover <b>symptoms</b> from {{excessive}} drinking may {{be confused with}} withdrawal <b>symptoms.</b> Many addicts will maintain their drinking to avoid withdrawal sickness, drinking small amounts frequently. They will try to hide their drinking problem from others and will avoid gross intoxication.|$|E
5|$|Discontinuation of benzodiazepines or abrupt {{reduction}} of the dose, even after a relatively short course of treatment (three to four weeks), may result in two groups of symptoms—rebound and withdrawal. Rebound <b>symptoms</b> are {{the return of the}} <b>symptoms</b> for which the patient was treated but worse than before. Withdrawal <b>symptoms</b> are the new <b>symptoms</b> that occur when the benzodiazepine is stopped. They are the main sign of physical dependence.|$|E

50|$|Some less {{complicated}} {{but often}} used interventions in SFT would be, prescribing the <b>symptom,</b> relabeling, and paradoxical interventions. Prescribing the <b>symptom</b> {{would be when}} the therapist attempts to exaggerate a specific <b>symptom</b> within the family to help the family understand how damaging that <b>symptom</b> is to the family. The relabeling intervention is done within the session by the therapist to change the connotation of one <b>symptom</b> from negative to positive. In this way the family can view the <b>symptom</b> in a new context or have a new conceptual understanding of the <b>symptom.</b>|$|R
5|$|If {{signs of}} {{disturbance}} are present {{for more than}} a month but less than six months, the diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder is applied. Psychotic <b>symptoms</b> lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, and various conditions may be classed as psychotic disorder not otherwise specified, while schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if <b>symptoms</b> of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic <b>symptoms.</b> If the psychotic <b>symptoms</b> are the direct physiological result of a general medical condition or a substance, then the diagnosis is one of a psychosis secondary to that condition. Schizophrenia is not diagnosed if <b>symptoms</b> of pervasive developmental disorder are present unless prominent delusions or hallucinations are also present.|$|E

5|$|Many of the <b>symptoms</b> of {{lung cancer}} (poor appetite, weight loss, fever, fatigue) are not specific. In many people, the cancer has already spread beyond the {{original}} site {{by the time they}} have <b>symptoms</b> and seek medical attention. <b>Symptoms</b> that suggest the presence of metastatic disease include weight loss, bone pain and neurological <b>symptoms</b> (headaches, fainting, convulsions, or limb weakness). Common sites of spread include the brain, bone, adrenal glands, opposite lung, liver, pericardium, and kidneys. About 10% of people with lung cancer do not have <b>symptoms</b> at diagnosis; these cancers are incidentally found on routine chest radiography.|$|E
40|$|<b>Symptom</b> {{experience}} (occurrence {{and perceived}} distress) associated with {{side effects of}} immunosuppressive medications in organ transplant patients may well be associated with poorer {{quality of life and}} medication non-compliance. The aims of this study were: first, to assess <b>symptom</b> experience in clinically stable adult patients during long-term follow-up after liver transplantation; and second, to study the relationship between <b>symptom</b> experience and medication non-compliance. This cross-sectional study included 123 liver transplant patients. <b>Symptom</b> experience was assessed using the "Modified Transplant <b>Symptom</b> Occurrence and <b>Symptom</b> Distress Scale" (29 -item version) at the annual evaluation. According to the duration of follow-up, patients were divided into a short-term (1 - 4 yr) and a long-term (5 - 18 yr) cohort. Medication non-compliance was measured using electronic monitoring. Results showed that increased hair growth was the most frequent <b>symptom</b> in both sexes. <b>Symptom</b> distress was more serious in women than in men. The most distressing <b>symptom</b> in women was excessive and/or painful periods, while in men this was impotence. Clear differences were revealed at item level between <b>symptom</b> occurrence and <b>symptom</b> distress in relationship with the two time cohorts and between sexes.

40|$|Purpose/Objectives: To derive <b>symptom</b> {{clusters}} and their clinical meanings in Chinese patients with primary liver cancer (PLC), {{to examine the}} factors related to the identified <b>symptom</b> clusters, and to validate {{the impact of the}} identified <b>symptom</b> clusters on patients' quality of life (QOL). Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Inpatient departments at a medical center for hepatobiliary disease in China. Sample: 277 patients with PLC, aged 18 - 77 years. Methods: Data were collected from a number of measures, including demographic and disease characteristics, the MD Anderson <b>Symptom</b> Inventory, six additional <b>symptom</b> items specific to PLC, and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Hepatobiliary questionnaire. Factor analysis was used to derive <b>symptom</b> clusters, independent-samples t test or one-way analysis of variance was performed to identify the factors related to each <b>symptom</b> cluster, and multivariate regression models were applied to examine the predictive impact of the identified <b>symptom</b> clusters on PLC. Main Research Variables: Demographic and medical variables, <b>symptom</b> clusters, and QOL. Findings: Three <b>symptom</b> clusters were identified: gastrointestinal sickness, neuropsychological, and liver dysfunction. Patients who received liver protection treatment, received more than one kind of treatment, and had poorer physical performance, worse liver function, and more advanced cancer scored higher in severity across all three <b>symptom</b> clusters. All of the <b>symptom</b> clusters explained 48 % of the QOL variance, and the liver dysfunction <b>symptom</b> cluster (adjusted R 2 = 0. 425) showed a superior influence. Conclusions: The liver dysfunction <b>symptom</b> cluster may be unique to Chinese patients with PLC. Patients with certain demographic and disease characteristics could be at risk for experiencing severe <b>symptom</b> clusters. In addition, a differential impact of the <b>symptom</b> clusters on QOL was noted in these patients. Implications for Nursing: The factors related to severity should be considered when managing <b>symptom</b> clusters. Because the predictive impacts of the three individual <b>symptom</b> clusters on QOL were varied and ordered in magnitude, healthcare providers should first alleviate the primary <b>symptom</b> cluster. This approach could be cost-effective and improve QOL...|$|R

Because of this, diagnosis of Wilson's disease is rarely made when only psychiatric <b>symptoms</b> are present.|$|E
5|$|<b>Symptoms</b> of Huntington's disease most {{commonly}} become noticeable {{between the ages}} of 35 and 44years, but they can begin at any age from infancy to old age. In the early stages, there are subtle changes in personality, cognition, and physical skills. The physical <b>symptoms</b> are usually the first to be noticed, as cognitive and behavioral <b>symptoms</b> are generally not severe enough to be recognized on their own at the earlier stages. Almost everyone with Huntington's disease eventually exhibits similar physical <b>symptoms,</b> but the onset, progression and extent of cognitive and behavioral <b>symptoms</b> vary significantly between individuals.|$|E
5|$|The most {{recognizable}} <b>symptoms</b> in Parkinson's disease are movement ("motor") related.

How does a <b>symptom</b> achieve to say something? And even more, why does a subject enjoy his/her <b>symptom?</b> Approaching an answer allows us to take a position on the clinic of the <b>symptom</b> to think about its orientation...|$|R

5|$|The {{signs and}} <b>symptoms</b> of {{paracetamol}} toxicity occur in three phases. The first phase begins {{within hours of}} overdose, and consists of nausea, vomiting, a pale appearance, and sweating. However, patients often have no specific <b>symptoms</b> or only mild <b>symptoms</b> in the first 24hours of poisoning. Rarely, after massive overdoses, patients may develop <b>symptoms</b> of metabolic acidosis and coma early {{in the course of}} poisoning.|$|E
5|$|The <b>symptoms</b> of {{poisoning}} {{are typically}} gastrointestinal and neurological. <b>Symptoms</b> occur within 6–12hours of consumption, although cases of more severe poisoning may present sooner—as little as 2 hours after ingestion. Initial <b>symptoms</b> are gastrointestinal, with sudden onset of nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea {{which may be}} bloodstained. Dehydration may develop if the vomiting or diarrhea is severe. Dizziness, lethargy, vertigo, tremor, ataxia, nystagmus, and headaches develop soon after; fever often occurs, a distinctive feature which does not develop after poisoning by other types of mushrooms. In most cases of poisoning, <b>symptoms</b> do not progress from these initial <b>symptoms,</b> and patients recover after 2–6 days of illness.|$|E
5|$|Typically, people {{infected}} with dengue virus are asymptomatic (80%) or have only mild <b>symptoms</b> {{such as an}} uncomplicated fever. Others have more severe illness (5%), and in a small proportion it is life-threatening. The incubation period (time between exposure and onset of <b>symptoms)</b> ranges from 3 to 14 days, but most often it is 4 to 7 days. Therefore, travelers returning from endemic areas are unlikely to have dengue if fever or other <b>symptoms</b> start more than 14days after arriving home. Children often experience <b>symptoms</b> {{similar to those of}} the common cold and gastroenteritis (vomiting and diarrhea) and have a greater risk of severe complications, though initial <b>symptoms</b> are generally mild but include high fever.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify <b>symptom</b> clusters and their effect on quality of life (QOL) of adults with chronic leg ulcers of mixed venous and arterial aetiology. A secondary analysis of data from four existing prospective longitudinal studies conducted by a wound healing research group in Australia was undertaken. A total of 110 patients who met the inclusion criteria were selected for this study. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to identify <b>symptom</b> clusters and correlational analyses to examine relationships between the identified <b>symptom</b> clusters and QOL. The EFA identified two distinct <b>symptom</b> clusters: a 'systemic <b>symptom</b> cluster' consisting of pain, fatigue and depressive symptoms; and a 'localised-leg <b>symptom</b> cluster' including pain, fatigue, oedema, lower limb inflammation and exudate. Physical QOL correlated significantly with the systemic <b>symptom</b> cluster (r = - 0 · 055, P < 0 · 0001) and the localised-leg <b>symptom</b> cluster (r = - 0 · 054, P < 0 · 0001), whereas mental QOL was associated only with the systemic <b>symptom</b> cluster (r = - 0 · 038, P = 0 · 01). The results suggest that appropriate intervention strategies targeting specific <b>symptom</b> clusters should be developed. Targeting patients with <b>symptom</b> clusters is particularly important because they are at high risk and the most vulnerable for reduced QOL...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the therapeutic efficacy and safety of the Shi-cha capsule, a Chinese herbal formula, in the treatment of patients with wind-cold type common cold. In our multi-center, prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial, patients with wind-cold type common cold received 0. 6 [*]g of Shi-cha capsule plus 0. 6 [*]g placebo (group A), 1. 2 [*]g of Shi-cha capsule (group B), or 1. 2 [*]g placebo (group C), three times daily for 3 days and followed up to 10 days. The primary end point was all <b>symptom</b> duration. The secondary end points were main <b>symptom</b> duration, minor <b>symptom</b> duration, the changes in cumulative <b>symptom</b> score, main <b>symptom</b> score, and minor <b>symptom</b> score 4 days after the treatment, as well as adverse events. A total of 377 patients were recruited and 360 met the inclusive criteria; 120 patients constituted each treatment group. Compared with patients in group C, patients in groups A and B had significant improvement in the all <b>symptom</b> duration, main <b>symptom</b> duration, minor <b>symptom</b> duration, as well as change from baseline of cumulative <b>symptom</b> score, main <b>symptom</b> score, and minor <b>symptom</b> score at day 4. The <b>symptom</b> durations and scores showed slight superiority of group B over group A, although these differences were not statistically significant. There were no differences in adverse events.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVETo {{analyze the}} {{distribution}} and combined regulation of elements of <b>symptom</b> patterns in the diagnosis of insomnia with Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). METHODSThe samples were collected from the patients, diagnosed with insomnia, of Henan Province Hospital of TCM between June 2011 and September 2013. The <b>symptom</b> patterns in insomnia were extracted. Next, <b>symptom</b> differentiation, characteristics of polysomnography (PSG), distribution and combined regulation of these <b>symptom</b> patterns were conducted by tests. RESULTSIn total, 286 eligible patients were recruited. The main locations of the disease <b>symptom</b> elements were the brain and heart, and the main characteristics of the disease <b>symptom</b> elements were phlegm-heat, Yin-deficiency and Qi-stagnation. The elements from two or three <b>symptom</b> patterns were commonly manifested in patients with insomnia, especially from three <b>symptom</b> patterns. We also found that all TCM <b>symptom</b> patterns {{had an effect on}} polysomnographic indicators in PSG tests. CONCLUSIONSThe elements of <b>symptom</b> patterns in insomnia were identified as mainly fire-heat and phlegm-heat. The most common patterns of excess were pathogenic fire derived from stagnation of liver-Qi, and mental disturbance due to phlegm-heat, while the most common patterns of deficiency in both the heart and the spleen.

5|$|Bites {{in which}} {{envenomation}} does occur are usually painless {{and may not}} even be noticed when contact is made. Teeth may remain in the wound. Usually, little or no swelling occurs, and rarely are any nearby lymph nodes affected. The most important <b>symptoms</b> are rhabdomyolysis (rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) and paralysis. Early <b>symptoms</b> include headache, a thick-feeling tongue, thirst, sweating, and vomiting. <b>Symptoms</b> that can occur 30minutes to several hours after the bite include generalized aching, stiffness, and tenderness of muscles all over the body. Passive stretching of the muscles is also painful, and trismus, which is similar to tetanus, is common. This is followed later on by <b>symptoms</b> typical of other elapid envenomations: a progressive flaccid paralysis, starting with ptosis and paralysis of voluntary muscles.
