40|$|A {{negative}} {{aspect of}} <b>serial</b> <b>flow</b> production systems is {{its lack of}} flexibility. Other production systems like the flexing flow and the shopping system are more flexible {{as the number of}} workers can be easily adjusted to temporal demands. But how efficient are these flexible systems? In a laboratory experiment we studied the worker’s productivity and the workload in a <b>serial</b> <b>flow,</b> flexing flow and shopping system. It appeared that the time for ‘walking across workstations’ in the flexible systems was similar to the time for ‘waiting’ in the <b>serial</b> <b>flow</b> line. In the flexible systems however, the working time per product was higher, which could be attributed to a ‘starting-up effect’ after each workstation switch. The subjects generally did prefer the flexible systems above the <b>serial</b> <b>flow</b> system. It is argued that in practical situations, where the cycle times are (much) higher, the variation in work pace is higher and the variation in work content is higher as compared to our experimental situation, the flexing flow and shopping systems may provide a productive alternative for <b>serial</b> <b>flow</b> systems...|$|E
40|$|This article {{demonstrates}} {{an approach}} to integrating human factors (HF) into a discrete event simulation (DES) study of semi-parallelised production strategies. Operationalised HF included operators’ autonomy at work, a known workplace health factor; and reduced operator capability, a factor for new or injured operators. These HF were tested in scenarios of <b>serial</b> <b>flow</b> and two degrees of semi-parallelised flow. The parallel production systems demonstrated better productivity than <b>serial</b> <b>flow</b> in all conditions tested and were less affected by either of the HF tested. It is concluded that HF can be integrated into DES which facilitates early consideration of operator risk and system vulnerabilities. Parallel production approaches, although less common in practice, appear to have advantages over <b>serial</b> <b>flow</b> in terms of productivity, injury risk and the accommodation of operators with temporarily reduced capacity. Further research should expand the range and test the validity of HF integrated into DES modelling procedures...|$|E

Flexible flow lines use flexible entities to generate multiple product variants using the same serial routing. Evaluative analytical models for the throughput rate of asynchronous <b>serial</b> <b>flow</b> lines were mainly developed for the Markovian case where processing times, arrival rates, failure rates and setup times follow deterministic, exponential or phase-type distributions. Models for non-Markovian processes are non-standalone and were obtained by extending the exponential case. This limits the suitability of existing models for real-world human-dependent flow lines, which are typically represented by a normal distribution. We exploit data mining and simulation modelling to derive a standalone closed-form formula for the throughput rate of normally distributed asynchronous human-dependent <b>serial</b> <b>flow</b> lines.

The objective is to investigate inventory policy, raw material ordering policy, production planning and scheduling policy, in the face of demand uncertainty, raw material arrival uncertainty and in-process failure. The tactics being explored include segmenting the <b>serial</b> <b>flow</b> line with decoupling buffers to protect against demand and raw material arrival uncertainty, and production smoothing to reduce production-related costs and the variance in upstream processes. Key policies for each segment include a work release policy from the decoupling buffer before the segment, and a production control policy to manage work-in-process inventory level within the segment and to meet inventory targets in each downstream decoupling buffer. We also explore raw material ordering policy with fixed ordering times, long lead-times and staggered deliveries in a make-to-order setting. A tactical model has been developed to capture the key uncertainties and to determine the operating tactics through analysis and optimization. This study also includes extensive numerical tests to validate the output of the tactical model as well as {{to gain a better understanding}} of how the tactical model reacts to different parameter variations. by Bin Huang.

More specifically, a recursive algorithm that generates the transition matrix for any value of the intermediate buffer capacity is developed and all possible transition equations are derived and solved analytically. Once the transition equations are solved the performance measures of the model under consideration can be easily evaluated.

Methods: Twenty aortic valve allograft recipients were investigated for donor-specific antibody and T-cell–mediated responses with <b>serial</b> <b>flow</b> cytometric and microlymphocytotoxic crossmatch assays and one-way mixed lymphocyte cultures. Results: Donor-specific immunoglobulin G antibodies to class I and II human leukocyte antigens were first detected in the serum of all aortic valve allograft recipients at 30 days after implantation and persisted in substantial amounts {{in all but one}} of the recipients at day 365. Recipient T-cell alloreactivity toward donor lymphocytes was significantly increased at day 30 compared with levels before and 10 days after operation. Conclusions: Cryopreserved aortic valve allografts elicit a substantial allogeneic response in recipients.
