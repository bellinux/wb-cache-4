50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was scheduled to}} ferry 13 empty cargo pallets to be filled at Jeddah then returned to Kano. The flight was nearly canceled because only five pallets were loaded onto the aircraft, and the employee who had keys to the cargo pallet storage area did not report for work that day. The captain nearly cancelled the flight until arrangements were made for seven more cargo pallets to be added. The aircraft took at approximately 17:00 UTC and arrived in Jeddah a few minutes past 22:00 UTC. The turnaround time would have normally taken {{an hour and a}} half, but it took {{two and a half hours}} since the cargo pallets had to be loaded after arrival in Jeddah. The {{aircraft was}} ready for takeoff at 00:30 UTC, but during the engine <b>start</b> <b>up</b> <b>procedure</b> engine number 4 would not start. Engine number 4 was repaired and the flight took off at 13:48 UTC en route to Kano and was expected at Kano at 18:19 UTC. The captain was not warned about any classified or hazardous material aboard. The flight engineer sensed a strange odor in the cockpit at flight level 35 as the aircraft approached N'Djamena, at about 17:00 UTC. The rest of the crew as well as the ground engineer and the load-master confirmed the smell had persisted for a while. The two passengers traced to odor to pallet 11 and which appeared to be misty. After being handed a fire extinguisher the applied it to the pallet and when they returned they were breathing heavily. Afterwards the smoke evacuation procedure was followed and the smell temporarily ceased. The flight was cleared to descend at 18:00 UTC. Shortly afterwards the master warning followed a minute later by a fire warning sounded. With smoke entering the cabin, the flight went into a descent of nearly 3000 feet per minute. Control of the pitch trims was lost. The flight engineer started a radio transmission to the airline at 1804:57 UTC that ended suddenly at 1805:04, the same time the cockpit voice recordings stopped. The two survivors both reported that the first explosion tripped the autopilot and the aircraft rocked sharply. The aircraft descended slowly in the grasses but rolled upon contact with the water.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Efficient and {{sustainable}} {{production of energy}} from biomass {{is one of the}} key factors in achieving the objectives set out in the Climate and Energy package of the European Commission. In the last decade, European and national research programs have focused both on local planning of biomass-to-energy pathways and on the improvement of the overall efficiency of energy conversion. Biomass-fired small-scale CHP systems can play an important role for the distributed cogeneration and the sustainable usage of local resources, but research is still required to improve the overall efficiency and reduce emissions. The state of the art for wood-fired CHP plants up to 3 MWe is represented by Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) (Turboden, 2013; Obenberger and Thek, 2008, Dong et al., 2009).

40|$|A window target {{unit for}} a LBE cooled primary core {{is one of}} the basic options {{considered}} in the framework of the Preliminary Design Study of eXperimental Accelerator Driven System (PDS-XADS). In the present work, thermal hydraulic analysis has been performed for this option focusing on the window cooling. At first system analysis has been performed for the entire target unit using the one-dimensional system code, HERETA. Then Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis has been carried out for lower part of the target to study the cooling capability of the window. The CFX 5. 6 code has been applied using an advanced turbulence model, called Sheer Stress Transport (SST) model, combined with the advanced wall treatment available in the new CFX 5 version. The results of the HERETA calculations show that a stable natural circulation flow, with a steady state flow rate of 192 kg/s, is established. No temperature peak is observed by a <b>start</b> <b>up</b> <b>procedure</b> with beam ramp having a period of 200 s. It is found, however, a <b>start</b> <b>up</b> <b>procedure</b> with beam jump has to be avoided to prevent the overheating of the window. Based on the results of CFX 5. 6 calculations, the window thickness is reduced to 2 mm in the center from the initial proposal of 3 mm in order to satisfy the thermal design limit. The maximum temperature change rate of the window under beam trips is predicted as high as 412 C/s after 0. 1 s of the beam interrupt. It is judged that beam trips with a beam interrupt duration less than 1 s could also be crucial to the integrity of the window. Finally, three postulated accidents (i. e., beam focusing, loss of heat sink, and unexpected beam jump) have been analyzed to find out the time for the beam to be switched off in order to avoid window failure. The present results show that window failure occurs in 0. 1 #propor to# 0. 8 second after the start of the beam focusing and in about 200 seconds after loss of heat sink. However, window failure is not expected for a beam jump scenario during normal operation period with full reactor power. (orig.)

40|$|Whole milk fouling of {{surfaces}} within {{dairy products}} processing plants, especially that which occurs on heat treatment equipment, {{is an important}} operating problem, threatening the quality of product and reducing thermal and mechanical efficiency of equipment. A fouling monitoring system was developed using a commercial heat flux probe and temperature sensor. The fouling monitor was installed in two unit operations of a custom built milk powder pilot plant. The unit operations replicated heat treatments found in plate heat exchangers and falling film evaporators. The research plate heat exchanger consisted of six miniature plate heat exchangers or modules in series. Individual modules could be isolated at any point during a run allowing access to the fouling deposit. The research falling film evaporator was a flat plate attached to a steam chamber and milk weir box. The onset and build-up of whole milk fouling on the evaporator plate was viewed through a sight window installed in the evaporator casing. Trials conducted with the research plate heat exchanger showed that the monitoring system could detect whole milk fouling {{in terms of a}} reduction in the overall heat transfer coefficient. This reduction was shown to directly correspond to an increase in fouling deposit thickness. For the same bulk milk temperature, the fouling rate decreased significantly when the surface was unheated compared with heated surfaces. This observation lead to a set of experiments that manipulated the <b>start</b> <b>up</b> <b>procedure</b> on both the milk and heating medium side of the research plate heat exchanger. More fouling was observed on plates after air start up (on the milk side) than on plates after water start up. Similarly, Surface Conditioning by Operational Protocol (SCOP) extended the fouling induction period. The SCOP trials compared steady state heating with unsteady state heating during start-up. Similar amounts of fouling were observed on plates removed from the steady state heated modules after 30 minutes and on plates removed from the unsteady state modules after 9 hours. These results indicate that the state of the stainless steel surface when the. milk first makes contact has an important effect on the subsequent rate of fouling. It is recommended that future work aims to identify which milk components deposit first onto the surface and what influence they have on inhibiting or facilitating fouling. The fouling monitoring system successfully estimated the extent of fouling for all of the trials. Industry trials for the fouling monitoring system, particularly on heated surfaces are recommended. The system will allow local areas of intense fouling to be mapped within the processing plants. A number of recommendations are presented concerning future work associated with <b>start</b> <b>up</b> <b>procedure</b> manipulation, evaporator trials and seasonal variation trials...|$|E

The thesis is concerned with serial data transmission at 9600 bit/sec over a voiceband channel, where the main impairments are additive noise and intersymbol interference, and the latter varles slowly with time. The thesis includes {{a brief description of}} the ionospheric propagation medium and presents an equivalent baseband model of the HF channel, suitable for computer simulation of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) systems. A study of 16 -point QAM signals transmitted over voiceband HF channels is then carr-iod out usj-ng the given channel model. Several cost effective near-maximum-likelihood detection processes have been developed for HF modems. Each detector is here preceded by an adaptive linear filter that is adjusted to make the sampled impulse response of the channel and filter minimum phase. These detectors require an accurate knowledge of the sampled impulse response of the channel, if their full potential is to be achieved. The results of computer-simulation tests on the near-maximum-likelihood detectors are given, where these tests assume that other receiver operations such as channel estimation and adaptive linear filtering, together with element timing synchronisation and Doppler shift correction, are carried out perfectly. A recently developed HF channel estimator employing a simple feedforward transversal-filter and requiring knowledge of the number of skywaves is next investigated and a <b>starting</b> <b>up</b> <b>procedure</b> is developed for such an estimator. The technique is then made fully adaptive in the sense that it continues to operate correctly when the number of skywaves changes.

Finally modem synchronisation is studied and various techniques of element timing and carrier frequency synchronisation are proposed...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Before {{a patient}} can be {{connected}} to a mechanical ventilator, the controls of the apparatus need {{to be set up}} appropriately. Today, this is done by the intensive care professional. With the advent of closed loop controlled mechanical ventilation, methods will be needed to select appropriate start up settings automatically. The objective of our study was to test such a computerized method which could eventually be used as a start-up procedure (first 5 - 10 minutes of ventilation) for closed-loop controlled ventilation. DESIGN: Prospective Study. SETTINGS: ICU's in two adult and one children's hospital. PATIENTS: 25 critically ill adult patients (age > or = 15 y) and 17 critically ill children selected at random were studied. INTERVENTIONS: To stimulate 'initial connection', the patients were disconnected from their ventilator and transiently connected to a modified Hamilton AMADEUS ventilator for maximally one minute. During that time they were ventilated with a fixed and standardized breath pattern (Test Breaths) based on pressure controlled synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (PCSIMV). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Measurements of airway flow, airway pressure and instantaneous CO 2 concentration using a mainstream CO 2 analyzer were made at the mouth during application of the Test-Breaths. Test-Breaths were analyzed in terms of tidal volume, expiratory time constant and series dead space. Using this data an initial ventilation pattern consisting of respiratory frequency and tidal volume was calculated. This ventilation pattern was compared to the one measured prior to the onset of the study using a two-tailed paired t-test. Additionally, it was compared to a conventional method for setting up ventilators. The computer-proposed ventilation pattern did not differ significantly from the actual pattern (p > 0. 05), while the conventional method did. However the scatter was large and in 6 cases deviations in the minute ventilation of more than 50 % were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of standardized Test Breaths allows automatic determination of an initial ventilation pattern for intubated ICU patients. While this pattern {{does not seem to be}} superior to the one chosen by the conventional method, it is derived fully automatically and without need for manual patient data entry such as weight or height. This makes the method potentially useful as a <b>start</b> <b>up</b> <b>procedure</b> for closed-loop controlled ventilation...|$|E
40|$|Thermophilic {{anaerobic}} digestion offers certain advantages over mesophilic {{anaerobic digestion}} {{such as a}} higher rate of biogas production and significant pathogen reduction. Despite such advantages, there remain some key hurdles preventing the wider adoption of thermophilic digestion, one of them being that of a difficult <b>start</b> <b>up</b> <b>procedure.</b> To overcome this limitation, this thesis aims to determine suitable start-up conditions and inoculum sources suitable for thermophilic anaerobic digestion. Cow manure, a well-known source of methanogens, was compared to municipal solid waste (MSW) as seeds for of thermophilic anaerobic digestion start-up. Results indicated that in contrast to cow manure, MSW (collected from the metropolitan area of Perth, Western Australia) has a higher potential to be a thermophilic anaerobic seed as compared to cow manure. After incubating of MSW at 55 ˚C, methane was produced within 3 days with an initial methane production rate of 0. 7 L*L- 1 *day- 1. In an attempt to narrow down the source of thermophilic methanogens in a typical MSW, components of a typical MSW (vacuum cleaner dust, banana peel, kitchen waste, and garden waste), which might contain the thermophilic methanogens, were tested as inoculum for thermophilic methanogenesis with acetate as the substrate. Results singled out grass turf as the key source of thermophilic acetoclastic methanogens. Within 4 days of anaerobic incubation at 55 oC, anaerobically incubated grass turf samples produced methane accompanied by acetate degradation enabling the successful start-up of thermophilic anaerobic digestion. This indicates that turf has the ability to act as an alternative seed for the start-up of thermophilic anaerobic digestion. Theoretically, methanogens could be divided into two main groups: hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogens. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens generate methane from the reduction of carbon dioxide by utilizing hydrogen as an electron donor while acetoclastic methanogens cleave acetate to form methane and carbon dioxide. Therefore, investigation of both groups of methanogens in each fraction of turf was addressed in the current study. Characterization of the incubated turf sample identified the main hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogens present in turf to be Methanoculleus sp. and Methanosarcina sp. respectively. The current study also investigated the effects of co-digestion of grass leaves in anaerobic digestion on sodium toxicity. It was motivated by results of observations that with appropriate addition of sodium bicarbonate (330 mM), to tackle the early build-up of volatile fatty acids, successful start-up of MSW and grass leaves were established. A study was conducted to evaluate to what extent grass leave) could help in overcome the sensitivity of methanogenic populations to high sodium content. Results demonstrated the complete failure of the start-up of thermophilic anaerobic digestion at sodium concentration of 7. 8 g Na+/L. Grass leaves addition could, however, reduce the effects of sodium toxicity in both mesophilic and thermophilic digestion. Moreover, in an attempt to narrow down the component of grass leaves which is responsible for elevating sodium toxicity, different likely compounds present in grass leaves such as potassium and betaine were tested. Results revealed that addition of betaine (GB) (1, 5, 10 mM) was observed to be effective in increasing methane production in the presence of high sodium. To correlate the effect of GB to the effect caused by grass leaves, the GB content in the turf grass was determined. Results of betaine analysis showed that there was 3. 9 mg of GB present per g of fresh grass leaves, resulting in final expected GB concentration of 3. 3 mM. This implies that GB is one of the organic compounds contained in grass leaves, which {{plays an important role in}} the antagonistic effect of grass leaves toward sodium toxicity during thermophilic anaerobic digestion...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHighly {{increased}} {{fuel prices}} {{and the need for}} greenhouse emissions reduction from diesel engines used in marine and stationary applications make diesel engine exhaust gas heat recovery technologies attractive. Such technologies are of special importance for the large two stroke diesel engines due to their large absolute fuel consumption and long operating periods. In this type of engines despite their relatively low exhaust gas temperature there still exists a good potential to recover energy from the exhaust gas. While the use of Rankine cycle is already a well-established technology for energy production with increasing application base, it is still relatively new especially in the marine sector market. This technology offers advantages since it presents relatively high thermodynamic cycle efficiency at both part and full load operation, relatively simple <b>start</b> <b>up</b> <b>procedures,</b> automatic and continuous operation without operator intervention, simple maintenance procedures and long lifecycles. In the present paper, a theoretical study is conducted on a two stroke marine diesel engine equipped with a Rankine cycle to evaluate the potential benefits for fuel consumption. The results with some constraints are also valid for stationary engines used for power generation. A simulation model of the Rankine cycle was developed and employed to estimate the operating parameters of the system. The bottoming cycle considered exploits heat from the exhaust gas stream and the charge air cooler. A comparative evaluation is made for the increase of overall efficiency when using either steam or organic as working medium of Rankine cycle. The analysis reveals that specific fuel consumption is improved for the entire operating range of the installation. Considering the absolute fuel consumption of such engine, {{it appears to be a}} promising solution especially if fuel prices remain at the present levels or rise and towards the direction of CO 2 emissions reduction...|$|R

The immobilized cell reactor is operated at different dilution rates and the advantages of using an internal pH adjustment system are discussed. the fermentation system proved to be fairly stable over periods of up to six weeks of continuous operation.

The two highlighted grey sections are specific for the client version of the game and their counterparts are specifically for the server version of the game. The end users can control the avatar and toggle main menu for different tasks in the server and clients.|$|R

40|$|Under a {{constant}} applied load, {{the operation of}} a typical elastohydrodynamic lubrication involves three stages, namely the <b>start</b> <b>up</b> stage, the normal steady state operation stage and the shut down stage. Previous works focused on the second normal steady state operation stage, in which a continuous lubricant film is separating the contacting surfaces. This dissertation numerically and analytically studies the lubrication behavior in the <b>start</b> <b>up</b> and shut down stages of elastohydrodynamic lubrication operations. ^ A mixed phase lubricated-solid contact model is developed to study the <b>start</b> <b>up</b> stage and demonstrates {{the transition from the}} initial solid to solid contact, to the mixed lubricated-solid contact, and finally to the fully lubricated contact. A surface temperature model is developed to calculate the surface temperature rise in the <b>start</b> <b>up</b> process of circular contact in sliding conditions. Because of the solid contact occurring during this process, significant frictional heat is generated and the surface temperature rise is very high. ^ The shut down process of elastohydrodynamic lubrication operation is studied and the numerical results are compared with the experimental results. Because of the characteristics of EHL flow, analytical expressions are derived to predict the pressure and film thickness changes during the shut down process and these predictions agree well with the numerical results. ^ Surface pocket effects in line contact <b>start</b> <b>up</b> condition are then examined in an effort to achieve beneficial tribological performance through surface modification. In the initial static contact situation, lubricant trapped inside the pocket generates hydrostatic pressure and reduces the pressure spikes and subsurface stresses, compared with the dry contact situation. When the surfaces start to move, this hydrostatic pressure enables a pocket lubricant film build up in addition to the inlet lubricant film build <b>up.</b> Essentially the <b>start</b> <b>up</b> process is divided into two parallel micro-EHL <b>start</b> <b>ups.</b> The <b>start</b> <b>up</b> time is reduced and the solid contact vanishes faster than the smooth surface <b>start</b> <b>up.</b> As a result, the frictional heat in the <b>start</b> <b>up</b> process would be much smaller and subsequently the surface temperature rise would be much reduced, compared with the smooth surface <b>start</b> <b>up</b> condition. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{automobile}} manufacturers aspire {{to improve the}} engine design and enhance its life apart from optimizing the energy usage in the actual engine operation. A major concern {{at the time of}} the initial <b>start</b> <b>up</b> at the low loads and speed conditions is the wear of an engine. A significant proportion of the engine life gets compromised due to the adhesive engine <b>start</b> <b>up</b> wear. The <b>start</b> <b>up</b> wear does not exist during the normal engine operation due to the fully established elastohydrodynamic lubricating (EHL) film between the interacting surfaces of the piston assembly and the cylinder liner at the high loads, speeds and the optimum piston-to-bore radial clearances. Such arrangements do not exist in a few initial engine <b>start</b> <b>up</b> cycles. Resultantly, the piston skirts and the 1 st compression ring establish a physical contact with the liner and adhesive wear occurs. This PhD research work numerically models the lubrication of the piston skirts and the 1 st compression ring in the initial engine <b>start</b> <b>up.</b> The 2 -D hydrodynamic and EHL models of the piston skirts are developed in the initial engine <b>start</b> <b>up</b> conditions. The initial engine <b>start</b> <b>up</b> conditions cover the secondary transverse piston displacements and the different <b>start</b> <b>up</b> speeds, radial clearances & viscosity-grades of an engine lubricant. The realistic aspects include the isothermal & adiabatic conditions, the steady-state and transient conditions, the Newtonian and non-Newtonian engine lubricant behavior, the surface roughness factors of the piston skirts and the liner. These aspects are modeled, studied and analyzed separately as part of the hydrodynamic and EHL models of the skirts. The 1 -D and the 2 -D steady-state isothermal Newtonian lubrication models of 1 st compression ring are developed as applicable to the initial engine <b>start</b> <b>up</b> conditions. The simulation analysis are studied to optimize the different realistic aspects/characteristics in an effort to reduce the engine <b>start</b> <b>up</b> wea...|$|R
