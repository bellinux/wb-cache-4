25|$|In her teens, Addams had big dreams—to do <b>something</b> <b>useful</b> in the world. Long {{interested}} in the poor from her reading of Dickens and inspired by her mother's kindness to the Cedarville poor, she {{decided to become a}} doctor so that she could live and work among the poor. It was a vague idea, nurtured by literary fiction. She was a voracious reader.|$|E
25|$|Swiss {{electrical}} engineer George de Mestral invented his first touch fastener when, in 1941, {{he went for}} a walk in the woods and wondered why Burdock seeds cling to his coat and dog. He discovered it could be turned into <b>something</b> <b>useful.</b> He patented it in 1955 and subsequently refined and developed its practical manufacture until its commercial introduction in the late 1950s.|$|E
25|$|The {{materials}} for baskets were sedge root, willow shoots and roots, bulrush or blackroot, redbud shoots, sometimes bracken fern {{and a variety}} of colorful bird feathers, abalone and other types of shells, magnesite beads and sometimes glass beads. Redbud shoots, used for the darker reddish colors in basket designs are gathered in October. Good redbud is hard to obtain around Ukiah, so it is usually found at Clear Lake. All these materials are gathered with a thankful heart and the gatherers talk continuously to the plants. They were, after all, living things that were giving themselves for <b>something</b> <b>useful</b> and beautiful. In order to preserve the soil and creek banks, sedge gathering was done with care. The commonly held decision would be leaving behind about half of what was found. Dyeing of the bulrush root takes about three to six months in a concoction of black walnuts, rusty metal and ashes in water.|$|E

500|$|Signalling {{systems are}} shaped by mutual {{interests}} between signallers and receivers. [...] An alert bird such as a Eurasian jay warning off a stalking predator is communicating <b>something</b> <b>useful</b> to the predator: {{that it has been}} detected by the prey; it might as well quit wasting its time stalking this alerted prey, which it is unlikely to catch. [...] When the predator gives up, the signaller can get back to other tasks such as feeding. [...] Once the stalking predator is detected, the signalling prey and receiving predator thus have a mutual interest in terminating the hunt.|$|E
500|$|Musson {{received}} an enthusiastic call in late February from a past member of Plastic Little {{telling him that}} his voice was sampled on [...] "Harlem Shake". Musson {{did not have a}} problem with Baauer using the sample without his permission and found the song's production [...] "phenomenal". He subsequently called Baauer to thank him for [...] "doing <b>something</b> <b>useful</b> with our annoying music". However, he felt that the allusion to the dance was [...] "peculiar" [...] and outdated: [...] "I was like, Who the fuck is rapping about the Harlem Shake in 2012?" [...] Musson {{said in an interview in}} March that he was negotiating with Mad Decent over compensation and that, although no agreement had been reached, the label had been [...] "more than cooperative during this".|$|E
2500|$|Daniel Dennett {{says that}} prayer may relieve {{a person of}} the need to take active {{measures}} to address issues around them, [...] stating: Surely it does the world no harm if those who can honestly do so pray for me! No, I'm not at all sure about that. For one thing, if they really wanted to do <b>something</b> <b>useful,</b> they could devote their prayer time and energy to some pressing project that they can do something about.|$|E

6000|$|... "Because {{it is so}} new, so busy, so healthy, so {{thoroughly}} practical.

60|$|Thus far, {{my father}} had no worse anxieties about him than those occasioned by his high spirits and his heavy debts.
