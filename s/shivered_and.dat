At over three hours in length (including intermissions), {{the film was}} {{ground-breaking}} in its production value, budget and ambition. At the time, the film was unlike anything the American audiences had ever seen before. The Los Angeles Times in a review called The Birth of a Nation [...] "the greatest picture ever made and the greatest drama ever filmed", going on to say [...] "it was beyond doubt the most extraordinary picture that has ever been seen". The Reverend Charles Henry Parkhurst defended the film against the charge of racism by saying the film [...] "was exactly true to history" [...] by depicting freedmen as they were, and therefore the film was a [...] "compliment to the black man" [...] by showing how far black people had [...] "advanced" [...] since Reconstruction. The critic Dolly Dalrymple reported about an audience in Alabama [...] "when I saw it, {{it was far from}} silent...incessant murmurs of approval, roars of laughter, grasps of anxiety, and outbursts of applause greeted every new picture on the screen".. One man viewing the film was so moved by the scene where Flora Cameron flees Gus to avoid to being raped that he took out his handgun and began firing at the screen in an effort to help her. The American author Katherine DuPre Lumpkin in her 1947 autobiography The Making of a Southerner recalled watching the film as a 18-year old in 1915: [...] "Here was the black figure—and the fear of the white girl—though the scene blanked out just in time. Here were the sinister men the South scorned and the noble men the South revered. And through it all the Klan rode. All around me people sighed and <b>shivered,</b> <b>and</b> now and then shouted or wept, in their intensity." [...] Dixon himself was well pleased with the reaction of white audiences to the film. In a letter sent on May 1, 1915, to Joseph P. Tumulty, the press secretary to President Wilson, Dixon wrote: [...] "The real purpose of my film was to revolutionize Northern sentiments by a presentation of history that would transform every man in the audience into a good Democrat...Every man who comes out of the theater is a Southern partisan for life!". In letter to President Wilson sent on September 5, 1915, Dixon boasted: [...] "This play is transforming the entire population of the North and the West into sympathetic Southern voters. There will never be an issue of your segregation policy". Dixon was alluding to the fact that Wilson upon becoming president in 1913 had imposed segregation on federal workplaces in Washington D.C. while reducing the number of black employees through demotion or dismissal.|$|E
