50|$|Melt {{filtration}} {{is typically}} used to remove contaminants from polymer melts during the extrusion process. There is a mechanical {{separation of the}} contaminants within a machine called a ‘screen changer’. A typical system will consist of a steel housing with the filtration medium contained in moveable pistons or slide plates that enable the processor to remove the screens from the extruder flow without stopping production. The contaminants are usually collected on woven wire screens which are supported on a stainless steel plate called a ‘breaker plate’ -- a strong circular piece of steel drilled with large holes to allow {{the flow of the}} polymer melt. For the recycling of polyester it is typical to integrate a <b>screen</b> <b>changer</b> into the extrusion line. This can be in a pelletizing, sheet extrusion or strapping tape extrusion line.|$|E
40|$|With {{the growing}} trend of using {{reclaimed}} synthetic fiber {{waste in the}} manufacturing of carpet fibers, manufacturers are recognizing the importance of effective filtration in their polymer extrusion processes. Selecting the optimum filter media for the <b>screen</b> <b>changer</b> and spin pack requires a comprehensive analysis of the application and users performance objectives. Users have {{a wide variety of}} filter media to choose from and each has unique characteristics that determine its suitability for a particular application. A review of currently available filter media and the process for selecting the optimum media for each application are discussed...|$|E
