40|$|Electrodeposition of zinc {{at current}} densities {{close to the}} mass {{transport}} limit produces needle-like dendrites. Suppressing dendrites is of technological interest to applications in <b>sacrificial</b> <b>corrosion</b> protection coatings and flow batteries. In the present work, we report the use of polyethylene glycol (PEG, M. W. = 200) as an effective electrolyte additive to suppress dendrites during zinc electrodeposition from halide-based electrolytes. Dendrite growth rate is measured {{as a function of}} the PEG concentration using in situ optical microscopy, which shows that the dendrite suppression efficacy due to PEG increases with PEG concentration. Polarization experiments on a rotating disk electrode provide system parameters, i. e., the exchange current density and the cathodic transfer coefficient, which confirm that PEG suppresses the zinc electrodeposition kinetics. The kinetic parameters are incorporated into a simple electrochemical model for activation-controlled dendrite propagation. The model predicts an order of magnitude reduction in the zinc dendrite growth rates in the presence of high concentration of PEG (10000 ppm), consistent with experimental findings...|$|E

However, Cd is banned due to its toxic nature and strict environmental regulations. In this study, the coating morphology and corrosion resistance of alternative, electrodeposited Zinc-cobalt (Zn-Co) and Zinc-cobalt-iron (Zn-Co-Fe) alloys have been investigated. Coatings with relatively high amounts of Co {{are very difficult to}} achieve due to anomalism associated with their deposition and are therefore not much reported so far. In this research Zn-Co and Zn-Co-Fe alloys with varying amount of Co (2 to 4 wt-%) and Fe (up to 1 wt-%) are electrodeposited. The deposition characteristics and microstructure of the Zn-Co alloys changed significantly with the variation in deposition parameter settings and corresponding Co content in the deposits. The <b>sacrificial</b> <b>corrosion</b> protection provided by Zn-Co and Zn-Co-Fe coatings was also studied.

40|$|Friction surface {{cladding}} is a {{newly developed}} solid state cladding process to manufacture thin metallic layers on a substrate. In this study {{the influence of}} process conditions on the clad layer appearance and the mechanical properties of both the clad layer and the substrate were investigated. Thin layers of commercially pure aluminum (approximately 0. 2 mm thick and 20 mm wide) could be successfully deposited {{on top of an}} AA 2024 -T 351 substrate within a range of process conditions. The quality of the deposited layers was shown to be highly dependent on the process temperature. Homogeneous, well bonded and defect free layers could be deposited within a 300 – 420 °C temperature range. At lower process temperatures no continuous layers were deposited, whereas at higher process temperatures mixing of the clad material with the substrate took place. Thermal simulations confirmed the relation between the process conditions and the amount of heat generated. An analytical model was developed to predict the occurrence of mixing. Additional bending and corrosion experiments demonstrated the high bonding quality and proper intrinsic and <b>sacrificial</b> <b>corrosion</b> performance of the manufactured layers...|$|E
40|$|Durability of {{reinforced}} concrete infrastructure is severely affected by corrosion of reinforcing steel. Conventional patch repair techniques {{are unable to}} stop this corrosion due to electrochemical incompatibility between the "repaired" concrete and the original "chloride-infested" concrete. This research was undertaken to compare the performance of different patch repair strategies of corroded concrete bridge deck slabs, proposed by different industrial partners, {{with respect to the}} conventional patch repair. The results show that the potential difference between the "repaired-patch" concrete and the "existing" concrete accelerates local corrosion around the patch, and gradually progresses towards the repaired zone. Beneficial effect of <b>sacrificial</b> anodes and <b>corrosion</b> inhibitors in a KCl and a NaCl environment, are evaluated {{at the beginning of the}} repair, however, their effectiveness decreases with time. Corrosion penetration rate obtained from Tafel Test, overestimated the actual rebar mass loss, indicating the need for more research in this area. It is recommended that for new construction, concrete must have low diffusivity to avoid premature deterioration, and for repair, electrochemical protection systems such as cathodic protection, embedded <b>sacrificial</b> anode, <b>corrosion</b> inhibitor, and chloride extraction should be considered to increase the service life of the repaired system. Surface coatings such as zinc, epoxy, sealer or membrane can be used as additional line of defence. In addition, the existing cracks must be treated, and the bridge deck drainage system and expansion joints must be designed properly to avoid ingress of chloride-contaminated water into the concrete...|$|R

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of global {{sustainability}} the long life of structures is essential and the durability performance of reinforced concrete structures {{is one of the}} key issues to be resolved. This paper reports the results of a series of long term corrosion tests on fiber reinforced cementitious composites containing polyethylene (PE) alone and hybrid steel cord (SC) and PE fibers. The results are also compared with ordinary mortar. The specimens are subjected to accelerated corrosion for one year by applying external potential to the steel bar anode and a cathode made out of a steel wire mesh placed outside the concrete. Durability performances of the specimens are examined through regular monitoring of the time to initiate corrosion, the corrosion area ratio, corrosion depth, and the amount of steel loss. Results show that the hybrid fiber reinforced cementitious composites (HFRCC) containing hybrid SC and PE fibers exhibited excellent performance compared to mortar and fiber reinforced cementitious composites (FRCC) containing PE fiber. The order of the durability performance is HFRCC, FRCC, and Mortar. It is observed that the <b>sacrificial</b> <b>corrosion</b> of some of the SC fibers in the HFRCC specimen played an important role in the significant reduction of steel bar corrosion in the specimen...|$|E
40|$|Cadmium (Cd) {{has been}} {{extensively}} used as an excellent corrosion protective coating for steel components in aerospace, automotive, electrical and fasteners industries. However, Cd is banned due to its toxic nature and strict environmental regulations. In this study, the electrodeposition mechanism and kinetics, coating morphology and corrosion resistance of alternative, electrodeposited Zinc-Cobalt (Zn-Co) and Zinc-Cobalt-Iron (Zn- Co-Fe) alloys have been investigated. Coatings with relatively high amounts of Co {{are very difficult to}} achieve due to anomalism associated with their deposition and are therefore not much reported so far. In this research Zn-Co and Zn-Co-Fe alloys with varying amount of Co (2 to 40 wt-%) and Fe (up to 1 wt-%) are electrodeposited and the effects of variation of process parameter settings (i. e. cathodic polarization, current density, temperature and electrolyte composition) on the electrodeposition mechanism and kinetics are investigated. The microstructure of the alloy coatings changed significantly with the variation in Co content in the deposits. The barrier and <b>sacrificial</b> <b>corrosion</b> protection provided by the coatings were investigated with a variety of electrochemical techniques and industrial accelerated tests. It was found that the sacrificial properties and the protection range decreases with increasing Co content in the alloy. For the highest Co content in the alloy, the coating may become more noble to steel and loses its sacrificial protection. The barrier resistance of the coatings increases with the increase of Co content in the alloy coating. Both Zn-Co and Zn-Co-Fe alloys with high Co content (> 32 wt-% Co) showed excellent barrier properties. An intermediate region of compositions can be distinguished in which the coatings would provide a good combination of sacrificial and barrier resistance properties and also a reasonable protection range. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Cadmium coatings are currently applied to steel fasteners used in aerospace applications. At present there are growing concerns, based on cadmium's toxicity and carcinogenicity, which may lead to its eventual banning. The aim of this research, therefore, {{was to find a}} possible replacement to electrodeposited cadmium for use on aerospace fasteners. Any replacement coating system should have all of the relevant properties that make cadmium so attractive, but without its obvious shortcomings. These beneficial properties include excellent corrosion resistance in chloride containing media (such as seawater), the ability to offer sacrificial protection to steel, excellent galvanic compatibility with most aluminium alloys and an inherent lubricity. Alternatives proposed and produced in this research are electrodeposited composite coatings containing PTFE particles, based on zinc or zinc alloys. Extensive analysis was carried out in order to characterise the coatings. Composition was determined by a number of methods; gravimetric analysis was used to determine the percentage of codeposited PTFE, while X-ray and X-ray wavelength energy dispersive analysis were used to determine the percentage of alloy element present in these coatings. Coating morphology was investigated by scanning electron microscopy. The <b>sacrificial</b> <b>corrosion</b> performance of each coating in relation to steel was studied using neutral salt-spray tests, while linear polarisation resistance tests gave an indication of their barrier corrosion properties. Galvanic compatibility of the coatings with aerospace grade aluminium alloys was investigated using a zero resistance ammeter. Two different tribological tests, an inclined plane test and a reciprocating wear test, were used to determine the coefficient of friction for the coatings. Finally, linear sweep voltammetry was used to compare the kinetics of electrodeposition from dilute solutions and corrosion in aqueous media for each of the coating systems. The composite coatings were found to offer either similar or slightly reduced corrosion performance to conventional zinc and zinc alloy coatings, but were inferior to commercially electrodeposited cadmium. However, the tribological properties of these coatings demonstrated a marked improvement over cadmium...|$|E
50|$|Colombia's Pacific coastline, where muddy rivers loop {{into the}} ocean, {{has long been}} a smugglers' paradise. Behind the jagged cliffs that jut into the ocean is a vast jungle, laced with mangrove-fringed coves and {{virtually}} thousands of kilometres of waterways, apt for clandestine shipyards. A Colombian Navy Commander stated that it is most striking to notice the logistical capacity required of these criminals in order to take all the material {{into the heart of the}} jungle, including heavy equipment such as propulsion gear and generators. Sometimes they are put together in pieces and then reassembled in other locations under the jungle canopy, in camps outfitted with sleeping quarters for workers. The narco-submarines can cost about $2 million USD and take upward of a year to build. Despite the costs, some of the craft are intended for one-time use, being abandoned at sea after a successful delivery. After all, their cargoes carry a street value of up to $400 million. On other seized craft however, officials found zinc bars used as <b>sacrificial</b> anodes, reducing <b>corrosion</b> on metal parts exposed to seawater. As corrosion would not be a concern on a single trip but is a factor influencing long-term durability, this is a clear indication that multiple use was intended. This, in turn, opens up the question of any illicit return cargo, like weapons, that they might carry back to Colombia.|$|R
40|$|Hot-dip {{galvanizing}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} used methods to apply zinc-based coatings on steels in order to provide <b>sacrificial</b> protection against <b>corrosion</b> over all the steel surface. The efficiency of the protection is affected by the coating mechanical response to loading: cracking and coatings delamination during forming and/or during service could decrease the corrosion resistance and could allow the contact between the environment and the substrate (the steel). The aim of this work is the analysis of the hot dip zinc coated steel plates mechanical properties by means of a non-standardized bending test performed minimizing both the bending moment differences along the bending axis and the interactions between the clamping system and the specimen coating. Bending tests are performed both on non-coated and on hot dip zinc coated plates, correlating the measured variables (applied load and crosshead displacement) with the bending moment and the specimen bending angle. Tests are characterised by a good repeatability. Results show that the main damaging mechanisms depend on the different mechanical behaviour of the intermetallic phases and on their thickness. For all the investigated coating conditions, radial cracks are observed. They initiate corresponding to the Γ phase and propagate up to the ζ−η interface. The coating thickness increase implies both an increase of the importance of the cracks in δ and ζ phases and the presence of cracks at ζ−δ interfaces. As a consequence, the increase of coating thickness implies an increase of the susceptibility to a coating-steel debounding damage mechanism, with a consequent loose of the coating adhesion and a decreasing of the capability of the zinc coating to improve the steel corrosion resistance. ...|$|R

The <b>corrosion</b> resistance varies with the phosphorus content of the deposit: relatively high for a high-phosphorus electroless nickel deposit but low for a low-phosphorus electroless nickel deposit. In the present investigation ternary Nix 2013;Wx 2013;P alloy films were prepared using alkaline citrate-based bath. Quaternary Nix 2013;Wx 2013;Cux 2013;P films were deposited {{by the addition of}} 3 mM copper ions in ternary Nix 2013;Wx 2013;P bath. X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies indicated that all the deposits were nanocrystalline, i. e. 1. 2, 2. 1 and 13; 6. 0 nm, respectively, for binary, ternary and quaternary alloys. Corrosion resistance of the films was evaluated in 3. 5 % sodium chloride solution in non-deaerated and deaerated conditions by potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance (EIS) methods. Lower corrosion current density values were obtained for the coatings tested in deaerated condition. EIS studies showed that higher charge transfer resistance values were obtained for binary Nix 2013;P coatings compared to ternary or quaternary coatings. For all the coatings a gradual increase in the anodic current density had been observed beyond 740 mV. In deaerated condition all the reported coatings exhibited a narrow passive region and all the values of Ep, Etp and ipass were very close showing no major changes in the electrochemical behavior. In the non-deaerated conditions no passivation behavior had been observed for all these coatings. 13; xA 9; 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Preferential weld {{corrosion}} (PWC) {{remains a}} major operational challenge that jeopardizes {{the integrity of}} oil and gas production facilities. It is the selective dissolution of metal associated with welds, such that the weld metal (WM) and / or the adjacent heat-affected zone (HAZ) corrode rather than the parent metal (PM). Corrosion inhibition is conventionally used to mitigate this problem however several indications suggest that some corrosion inhibitors may increase PWC. Furthermore, {{it is not possible to}} detect systems that are susceptible to PWC and or to understand the apparent ineffectiveness of some corrosion inhibitors at high flow rates. Consequently, the aim of this research is to assess the suitability of submerged jet impingement method to study flow accelerated preferential weld corrosion, which is critical to safe and economic operations of offshore oil and gas facilities. In this research, a submerged jet-impingement flow loop was used to investigate corrosion control of X 65 steel weldment in flowing brine, saturated with carbon dioxide at 1 bar, and containing a typical oilfield corrosion inhibitor. A novel jet-impingement target was constructed from samples of parent material, heat affected zone and weld metal, and subjected to flowing brine at velocities up to 10 ms- 1, to give a range of hydrodynamic conditions from stagnation to high turbulence. The galvanic currents between the electrodes in each hydrodynamic zone were recorded using zero-resistance ammeters and their self-corrosion rates were measured using the linear polarisation technique. At low flow rates, the galvanic currents were small and in some cases the weld metal and heat affected zone were partially protected by the <b>sacrificial</b> <b>corrosion</b> of the parent material. However, at higher flow rates the galvanic currents increased but some current reversals were observed, leading to accelerated corrosion of the weld region. The most severe corrosion occurred when oxygen was deliberately admitted into the flow loop to simulate typical oilfield conditions. The results are explained in terms of the selective removal of the inhibitor film from different regions of the weldment at high flow rates and the corrosion mechanism in the presence of oxygen is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Sheet steels {{intended}} for atmospheric exposure invariably require a <b>sacrificial</b> <b>corrosion</b> protective coating. Such coatings are commonly applied by either hot-dip galvanising or electrodeposition using large scale continuous processes. Armed {{with the desire}} to produce new products with improved performance, there has been considerable industrial interest in the use of physical vapour deposition (PVD) for the coating of sheet steels, and practical experience extends over the last three decades. Only in the last few years, however, have the most attractive aspects of P V D been investigated with some vigour: the preparation of novel alloy and multilayer coatings. In recognition of this climate, the research presented in this thesis was commenced with the intention of evaluating the microstructures of a range of alloy coatings prepared by magnetron sputtering. The investigation considered the impact of ion assistance on coating composition and microstructure, by using an unbalanced magnetron design and varying the bias voltage of the substrates, while maintaining a substrate temperature of 50 °C. The coating compositions targeted for study were based on the Al-Mg-Zn ternary system, with emphasis on the binary alloys. The study was mainly concerned with the investigation of supersaturated solid solubility and other metastable crystalline or amorphous phases. Coating characterisation was achieved by energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Bragg- Brentano X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the Crystallite Group Method (CGM). This latter technique is particularly effective for evaluation of the residual stress and strainfree lattice parameters for strongly fibre textured coatings. CGM was used for the first time for coatings with a close-packed hexagonal (cph) crystal structure. Elemental coatings of Zn, Al and Mg all developed strong fibre textures with the close-packed planes oriented parallel to the substrate surface. Ion assistance enhanced the texture of Zn and Al coatings while disrupting the preferred orientation of Mg coatings. Compressive residual stress was developed in ion assisted Al and Mg coatings due to the atomic peening mechanism. Energetic bombardment of Zn coatings resulted in tensile stress despite a dense, columnar structure which typically indicates compressive stress. This was explained by constrained shrinkage of the Zn coatings during dynamic recrystallisation. Zn and M g coatings were subject to very high proportions of entrapped Ar which was correlated to the residual stress, but was not causative. Al coatings did not retain detectable amounts of Ar. Binary Al-Zn alloy coatings possessed a dual phase structure with discrete (Al) and (Zn) grains. Supersaturation of the (Al) phase was apparent but there was some indication that it declined by spinodal decomposition or precipitation after ageing at room temperature. The surface appearance of Al-Zn coatings was influenced by the Zn content and substrate temperature, such that smooth reflective coatings with high Zn content (textured structure at lower substrate bias than was necessary for elemental Al coatings, probably because of a sputter yield amplification effect. The (Zn) phase in the alloy coatings also retained high proportions of Ar. Coatings of Al-Mg alloys were characterised by single-phase supersaturated (Al) solid solutions with up to about 38 at. %Mg, or a combination of supersaturated (Mg) and an amorphous phase for coatings with between 40 and 90 at. %Mg. The amorphous phase was thought to possess a composition of about 39 at. %Mg. The use of ion assistance resulted in preferential resputtering of M g from the coatings, due to the differences in surface binding energy. The consequential modification in stoichiometry was sufficient to produce different phases in the coatings, and also caused a sharp reduction in the supersaturation of (Al) and (Mg) solid solutions. Coatings containing the (Mg) phase were susceptible to the entrapment of exceptionally high proportions of Ar (The microstructure of binary Zn-Mg alloy coatings was also dependent on the composition. Coatings with between 15 and 40 at. %Mg were entirely amorphous due to slow growth kinetics of complex intermetallic phases within this composition range. Higher and lower Mg content typically provided coatings with a combination of terminal solid solutions and the amorphous phase. The solid solubility of (Zn) and (Mg) phases was considered to be within the equilibrium limits. Several intermetallic phases were detected in Zn-rich coatings, and some of these phases could not be identified. Ion assistance resulted in the preferential resputtering of Mg from the alloy coatings, which is opposite to the trend anticipated from elemental sputtering yields. This effect was attributed to sputter yield amplification, and was confirmed by Monte Carlo simulation of the ion assisted deposition process using the T-DYN code. All of the Zn-Mg coatings were susceptible to the retention of high proportions of Ar, particularly for the Mg-rich compositions. As for the Al-Mg coatings, the entrapped Ar appeared to favour amorphisation of the (Mg) phase. Coatings with high Ar content were sensitive to heavy oxidation with ageing. The ternary Al-Mg-Zn alloy coatings produced were based on Al-rich compositions. Ion assistance had a dramatic effect on the coating stoichiometry and microstructure. Increasing the ion energy resulted in the preferential resputtering of Mg, followed by Zn at higher energy. Coatings deposited with low bias were found to be amorphous, while those with virtually identical composition but prepared with high bias were found to contain (Al) phase with a strongfibre texture. Relatively high proportions of Ar were also present in coatings deposited with elevated bias, but did not interrupt the growth of (Al) phase, suggesting that it was associated with an undetected amorphous phase. The electrochemical performance of a range of the sputtered coatings was examined using a dilute chloride aqueous solution. The data was interpreted with the aim of pinpointing a coating with an optimum combination of both barrier and sacrificial properties which would ensure long term corrosion protection for a sheet steel substrate. All alloy coatings were found to exhibit passive regions. The results were interpreted to indicate that Al- 41 at. %Zn and Al- 13 at. %Mg- 20 at. %Zn coatings would provide an ideal combination of good barrier protection and acceptable sacrificial protection of sheet steel. Coatings consisting of Zn- 20 at. %Mg offered improvements in sacrificial protection relative to pure Zn coatings, while possibly having greater barrier protection properties...|$|E
