25|$|Gladys Pugh (Ruth Madoc) Chief Yellowcoat/Sports Organiser/Radio Maplin Announcer â€“ Gladys {{was born}} in 1933 in Pontypridd, and spent her youth in the Rhondda Valley. She joined Maplins holiday camp in 1955 and rose through the ranks to become sports {{organiser}} and later chief Yellowcoat. She won the competition for the most popular girl Yellowcoat every year between when she joined and 1959, when she was beaten by Sylvia Garnsey. Upon Jeffrey Fairbrother's arrival at the camp {{at the start of}} the 1959 season, she fell passionately in love with him, although he did not reciprocate this. On one occasion, she found herself in a situation where Jeffrey had unintentionally become drunk, and she helped him back to his chalet. The following morning he awoke naked with no memory of the previous night, and found Gladys' bra in his bed. What actually happened was left ambiguous. Gladys disliked all the other female Yellowcoats, in particular Sylvia Garnsey, whom she saw as competition in her fight for Jeffrey's affections. Like Jeffrey, she also disapproved of Ted's schemes to scam the campers, even though she secretly had her own scheme selling reconditioned tennis balls. In the 1960 season, Spike Dixon fell in love with her, although <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> this and it never amounted to anything. Gladys was left heartbroken when Jeffrey departed for Wisconsin without telling anyone at the end of the season, but she quickly recovered upon meeting Squadron Leader Clive Dempster, who arrived to take over Fairbrother's job. She immediately became attracted to Clive, and the two had an on-off relationship throughout the 1960 season. She eventually married Clive and moved to Australia with him at the end of the season.|$|E

She took his surname {{and over the next}} few years she grew up quickly, helping to care for the growing family as her stepfather's Air Force career moved them from Connecticut to New Mexico to Maine. In her own words, she {{described}} herself during this period as [...] "a shy, pretty little girl unhappily accustomed to moving from base to base every two or three years".
