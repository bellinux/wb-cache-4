40|$|AbstractSolar {{energy has}} become one of the most {{promising}} renewable energies being the most widespread used nowadays. In order to achieve an optimum performance, both photovoltaic and solar thermal applications require the use of some kind of <b>solar</b> <b>tracking</b> <b>technique.</b> Every solar concentration system has to constantly reposition itself according to the Sun's position changes throughout the day. This movement must be done in the most effective way as possible to avoid a high negative impact on the system efficiency. The present paper attempts to describe in detail the design process of a state-of-the-art semi-passive solar tracking concentrator (SPSTC) in which, in order to track the sun, two independent arrays of acrylic prisms are implemented to refract sunlight by rotating said prisms, thus being able to redirect solar radiation as desired. The first set of PMMA prisms is responsible of eliminating one of the directional components of the solar radiation; the task is achieved by rotating the prisms within the array at a specific angle. The second set of “refractive heliostats” deals with another of the sunlight's directional components, transforming its direction into a completely perpendicular pattern to the array. Having downward vertical radiations makes possible to implement a stationary Fresnel lens to concentrate the solar radiation for any application desired. The system is designed and validated using simulation software to prove the feasibility of the concept...|$|E

40|$|Meeting the ever-growing global {{energy demand}} while {{reducing}} carbon emissions {{is one of}} the most prominent challenges of our era. In this context, efficient control of an operation, service or production process is a key tool to achieve this goal. While there are many opportunities for efficient control within the energy sustainability agenda, this work focuses on domestic space heating systems and intermittent energy resources. This is because in many countries, such as the UK and the US, the domestic sector accounts for more than 20 % of the total energy consumption and over 40 % of this share is related to space heating. In addition, in recent years, an increasing number of intermittent energy resources, such as photovoltaic systems and wind turbine generators are being integrated into the grid. As such, efficient control of domestic space heating systems and intermittent energy resources can lead to a major reduction in energy consumption and the corresponding CO 2 emission. In more detail, domestic space heating automation systems (DHASs) aim to optimize the control process of domestic space heating systems with minimum user-input. Moreover, in the case of electricity-based heating, such systems can also incorporate economic control to exploit the energy buffer that heating loads provide in order to shift the heating consumption according to financial incentives, such as variable electricity import tariffs and/or the availability of cheap electricity coming from house-integrated intermittent energy resources. In the latter case, the financial benefits of economic control can be further amplified in domestic coalitions where a number of houses share their energy generation to minimize the collective energy imported from the grid. Against this background, the first main strand of work in this thesis is to develop a new DHAS, AdaHeat, that overcomes limitations of previous approaches regarding: (i) their efficiency in dealing with the thermal dynamics of houses, (ii) their efficiency in dealing with the inherent uncertainty of the occupancy schedule in domestic settings, (iii) their usability and effectiveness in meeting the user preferences, (iv) their ability to work in conjunction with a diverse range of heating systems, and (v) their ability to efficiently consider economic control in the case of electricity-based heating, exploiting also, for the first time, the aforementioned coalition potential. The backbone of AdaHeat is an adaptive model predictive control approach along with a new general heating schedule planning algorithm based on dynamic programming. In the case of economic control in the presence of house-integrated intermittent energy resources, our planning approach relies on stochastic predictions of the shared intermittent energy resource power output. To this end, we also develop a new adaptive site-specific calibration technique to improve such predictions based on Gaussian process modeling. We present thorough evaluation of the proposed system, and show its effectiveness in terms of Pareto efficiency and usability criteria against state-of-the-art DHASs. We also show that collective economic control, in the presence of house-integrated IERs, can improve heating cost-efficiency by up to 60 %, compared to independent economic control, and even more when compared to no economic control. The second strand of work is concerned with increasing the efficiency of intermittent energy resources themselves, through efficient control. In particular, specifically for photovoltaic systems, <b>solar</b> <b>tracking</b> can be used to orient the system towards the greatest possible levels of incoming solar irradiance. This can increase the power output of a photovoltaic system by up to 100 %. However, current <b>solar</b> <b>tracking</b> <b>techniques</b> suffer from several drawbacks: (i) they usually do not consider the forecasted or prevailing weather conditions; even when they do, they (ii) rely on complex closed-loop controllers and sophisticated instruments; and (iii) typically, they do not take the energy consumption of the trackers into account. As such, in this work, we propose PreST; a novel, low-cost and generic <b>solar</b> <b>tracking</b> approach that overcomes the above limitations, utilizing optimal control (proposed for the first time for <b>solar</b> <b>tracking).</b> In particular, our approach is able to calculate appropriate trajectories for efficient and effective day-ahead (predictive) <b>solar</b> <b>tracking,</b> based on available weather forecasts (that can come from on-line providers for free). To this end, we propose a new approximating policy iteration algorithm, suitable for large Markov decision processes, and a novel and generic <b>solar</b> <b>tracking</b> consumption model. Our simulations show that our approach can increase the power output of a photovoltaic system considerably, when compared to standard <b>solar</b> <b>tracking</b> <b>techniques,</b> that can lead to significant monetary gains. As outlined above, apart from their great share in contemporary economies, both domestic space heating systems and intermittent energy resources provide considerable opportunities for energy efficient improvements through efficient control. In this work we exploit this potential and propose respective systems that improve their independent, as well as their interaction, efficiency. This can considerably reduce the respective energy consumption and the corresponding CO 2 emission towards fulfilling our goal for an energy sustainable future...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{optimism}} of some molecular biologists, natural selection among the wild ancestors of crops {{is unlikely to}} have missed simple genetic improvements that would consistently have enhanced individual fitness. Tradeoff-free opportunities for further improvement of crop traits like photosynthetic efficiency or drought tolerance may therefore be elusive. Opportunities linked to acceptable tradeoffs may be abundant, however. Tradeoffs between individual competitiveness and the collective productivity of plant communities (e. g. those linked to height) have been key to past increases in yield potential. <b>Solar</b> <b>tracking</b> by leaves could involve such tradeoffs, if photosynthetic benefits to tracking leaves are outweighed by increased shading of leaves lower in the canopy. This hypothesis was tested using rotation in the horizontal plane to disrupt <b>solar</b> <b>tracking</b> in alfalfa. In sparse canopies, <b>solar</b> <b>tracking</b> increased net canopy photosynthesis, but rarely by more than 3 %. As leaf area increased, <b>solar</b> <b>tracking</b> tended to decrease net canopy photosynthesis, despite edge effects in our 1 -m 2 artificial communities, which probably exaggerated net photosynthetic benefits of tracking.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of an energy efficient <b>solar</b> <b>tracking</b> system from a normal mechanical single axis to a hybrid dual axis. For optimizing the <b>solar</b> <b>tracking</b> mechanism electromechanical systems were evolved through implementation of different evolutional algorithms and methodologies. To present the tracker, a hybrid dual-axis <b>solar</b> <b>tracking</b> system is designed, built, and tested based on both the solar map and light sensor based continuous tracking mechanism. These light sensors also compare the darkness and cloudy and sunny conditions assisting daily tracking. The designed tracker can track sun’s apparent position at different months and seasons; thereby the electrical controlling device requires a real time clock device for guiding the tracking system in seeking solar position for the seasonal motion. So the combination of both of these tracking mechanisms made the designed tracker a hybrid one. The power gain and system power consumption are compared with a static and continuous dual axis <b>solar</b> <b>tracking</b> system. It is found that power gain of hybrid dual axis <b>solar</b> <b>tracking</b> system is almost equal to continuous dual axis <b>solar</b> <b>tracking</b> system, whereas the power saved in system operation by the hybrid tracker is 44. 44 % compared to the continuous tracking system...|$|R

We compare <b>solar</b> <b>tracking,</b> leaf temperatures, photosynthetic rates and leaf longevity in two co-occurring species with contrasting leaf morphologies: Pelargonium lobatum has a large, shallowly lobed leaf and P. triste has a highly dissected leaf composed of many small leaflets. Pelargonium triste tracked the sun more closely than P. lobatum, although P. lobatum intercepted more direct light at midday despite less <b>solar</b> <b>tracking.</b> Leaf temperatures for the two species were more similar than predicted based on leaf energy budgets. Photosynthetic rates declined more in P. lobatum than P. triste {{at the end of}} the growing season and P. triste leaves were estimated to live 20 % longer. Leaf three-dimensionality has thermal effects beyond that predicted from a traditional energy budget equation. By moving, P. triste leaves heat up quickly in the morning yet experience little direct light at midday from self-shading leaflets. Pelargonium lobatum leaves warm more slowly but reach the same maximum temperature as P. triste. We hypothesize that the one-month longer life span of P. triste leaves is in part due to the avoidance of lethal leaf temperatures as summer approaches.
