40|$|AbstractIn the {{underwater}} vehicle launching process, some {{air in the}} launch tube {{will be involved in}} the low-pressure cavity formed at the <b>shoulder</b> <b>part</b> of the vehicle. This cavity mixed with air will collapse during water exit, causing dramatic change of flow field, which has a certain impact on the load environment. Based on homogeneous multiphase flow model, numerical simulation of the collapse of the cavity filled with vapor and involved air has been conducted. The results show that the nose shape with stronger cavitation ability is much easier to make the air in the launching tube involved in the low-pressure cavity. When air is mixed with vapor in the cavity, the rebound phenomenon will occur in the cavity collapse process. And there will also be multiple peaks of surface pressure...|$|R

Dislocations generate and accumulate at the <b>shoulder</b> <b>part</b> of the device area and bottom corners of the trench. Dislocations are categorized into two groups. In one group, dislocation lines are mostly straight and parallel to the trench direction, and in the other group, dislocations make half loop type structure.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a hybrid coding scheme suitable for coding of facial (videophone) image sequences at bit rates around 10 Kbits/s. The human head and <b>shoulder</b> <b>part</b> are parameterized by a wireframe model called Candide. The synthesized images {{are produced by}} a set of 18 parameters. Although the synthetic images generated by this model have subjectively better image quality than, for instance, those produced by traditional video coders (H. 261 / 263), the geometric distortions caused by the model analysis, the motion estimation, and the texture mapping errors may be annoying. This problem is partially solved by extracting the visually important information from the prediction error image and coding them efficiently by a subband coder. Our simulation results show that the hybrid coding scheme provides an improved quality in the decoded image sequence as compared to the model based scheme [1]. 1.

30|$|Liability {{rules have}} proven—particularly under {{uncertain}} conditions—a serviceable tool in enabling {{the development of}} potentially dangerous technology {{while at the same}} time having the profiteer <b>shoulder</b> <b>part</b> of the negative effects that might ensue. A liability system of this nature for the use of service robots represents an important instrument of control, especially considering the difficulties of attribution in partly autonomous systems. Such a liability system should not—similarly to genetic technology and nuclear law—be based solely on strict liability, but should rather incorporate a principle of fault. Otherwise, one might face the danger of excessive regulation that would compromise development in this field, especially in the private sector. One could, however, consider the introduction of mandatory liability insurance so as to absorb the damages sustained by third parties. In order to be able to establish standards for negligence, certain basic safety rules must be in place in private and freely accessible public space which the operators of service robots have to comply with. The problem of formulating such standards does not differ from standard-setting in other areas with highly dynamic development.|$|R

India, however, refers to its limited capacity and wide-spread energy poverty. Is India hiding behind its poor? While others examined the distribution of emissions within the country to answer this question, we study domestic policy making at the examples of energy subsidies and access to clean energy. Evidence {{from a combination of}} interviews and secondary sources suggests that domestic policy making is not generally inconsistent with the pro-poor arguments advanced at the international level. Given their large number and the country’s democratic system, the poor do have some weight in Indian politics. However, inconsistencies can be identified within India’s international discourse that simultaneously tries to project an image of a strong emerging economy, and of a poor developing country in need of special treatment. We show that this branding strategy is problematic both for the progress of international climate negotiations and for India’s poor...|$|R

As a backdrop of support, the user has to accept the increased base load of the technical components and the restriction of the freedom of movement. With a new biomimetic approach the transfer of musculoskeletal structures to the “Stuttgart Exo-Jacket” significantly augments the user's freedom of movement and reduces the weight of the exoskeleton. The lightweight spine module, made from 3 D printed plastic and the joint chain on the <b>shoulder</b> <b>parts,</b> which is leaned against the human spine and muscle parts, allows for most natural shoulders and back movements. Through the chain of artificial vertebral body modules and tensile rubber cables, the unhealthy flexion of the human spine during lifting can be effectively restricted.

The results show stress concentrations at the <b>shoulder</b> <b>part</b> of the device area and the bottom corners of the trench for the device isolation, and high stresses at these area cause plastic slip and dislocation accumulation.

50|$|An aventail or camail is a {{flexible}} curtain of mail {{attached to the}} skull of a helmet that extends to cover the throat, neck and <b>shoulders.</b> <b>Part</b> {{or all of the}} face, with spaces to allow vision, could also be covered. The earliest camails were riveted directly {{to the edge of the}} helmet, however, beginning in the 1320s in Western Europe a detachable version replaced this type. The detachable aventail was attached to a leather band, which was in turn attached to the lower border of the helmet by a series of pierced rivets, called vervelles. Holes in the leather band were passed over the vervelles, and a waxed cord was passed through the holes in the vervelles to secure it. Aventails were most commonly seen on bascinets in the 14th century and served as a replacement for a complete mail hood (coif). Some aventails were decorated with edging in brass or bronze links (sometimes gilded), or with a zig-zag lower edge (vandyked). By the mid 14th century, the aventail had replaced the mail coif completely.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the seizure of pressing process, we adopted a draw bending method to use pure titanium sheets of 1. 0 mm in thickness (JIS TP 340, ASTM Grade 2). The draw bending method was simulated under the conditions of die wall for pressing the glasses frame. The titanium sheet was dragged into the clearance between upper punch and die by the fall motion of the upper punch. The seizure occurred at the <b>shoulder</b> <b>part</b> and side wall part of die. The working conditions changed within the bending radius of die, the lubricating condition and punch speed. The surface roughness of titanium sheets and die surface were measured by the surface measuring instrument using PGI (Phase Grating Interferometry) system (Taylor Hobson Form Talysurf 1200). The surface roughness and the punch load increased intensely within a 10 mm of sliding distance under the non-lubricant condition, and increased gradually within a range of 10 to 50 mm in every die radius. The load of draw bending process {{was related to the}} variation of surface roughness. The seizure of the pressing process, occurring between the surfaces of specimen and die, was estimated by measuring the arithmetic mean roughness...|$|R
