5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle hunts mainly aquatic animals, such as fish, turtles and sea snakes, but {{it takes}} birds, such as little penguins, Eurasian coots and shearwaters, and mammals (including flying foxes) as well. In the Bismarck Archipelago it has been {{reported}} feeding on two species of possum, the northern common cuscus and common <b>spotted</b> <b>cuscus.</b> It is a skilled hunter, and will attack prey up {{to the size of a}} swan. They also feed on carrion such as dead sheep, birds and fish found along the waterline, as well as raiding fishing nets and following cane harvesters.|$|E
25|$|The cuscus, family Phalangeridae, are {{a family}} of {{marsupials}} {{closely related to the}} possums of Australia. The cuscus have evolved in New Guinea, and are found throughout the island. Most species are dark brown or black, however two species, the common <b>spotted</b> <b>cuscus</b> (Spilocuscus maculatus) and black <b>spotted</b> <b>cuscus</b> (Spilocuscus rufoniger), are black, orange and yellow.|$|E
50|$|The common <b>spotted</b> <b>cuscus</b> has an unspecialised dentition, {{allowing}} it to eat {{a wide variety of}} plant products. It eats the leaves of ficus, alstonia, and slonea plants, nectar, and the fruits of ficus, lithocarpus, aglia, and possibly mischocarpus and pometia plants. It is also known to eat flowers, small animals, and occasionally eggs. Predators of the common <b>spotted</b> <b>cuscus</b> include pythons and some birds of prey.|$|E
50|$|Animals {{found on}} Piccaninny Plains include the palm cockatoo, trumpet manucode, yellow-billed kingfisher, {{magnificent}} riflebird and <b>spotted</b> <b>cuscus.</b>|$|E
50|$|The common <b>spotted</b> <b>cuscus</b> is {{hunted for}} its meat and pelt in New Guinea, but {{has very little}} {{economical}} influence. Despite hunting, it is still common in New Guinea and most islands, but it is rarely spotted in Australia, mostly {{because it is a}} very shy creature. It was introduced by humans to Salyer, Mussau, and New Ireland, and has since flourished in these areas. The conservation status of the common <b>spotted</b> <b>cuscus</b> is least concern because of its wide population distribution, ability to flourish in a variety of environments, and lack of dominating predators. However, continued human expansion, an increase in demand for cuscus meat and pelts, and destruction of its natural habitat could lead to a demise in the <b>spotted</b> <b>cuscus</b> predominance.|$|E
50|$|The common <b>spotted</b> <b>cuscus</b> (Spilocuscus maculatus) is a cuscus, a {{marsupial}} {{that lives}} in the Cape York region of Australia, New Guinea, and nearby smaller islands.|$|E
50|$|The common <b>spotted</b> <b>cuscus</b> is {{typically}} very shy, {{so it is}} rarely seen, especially in northern Australia. It is nocturnal, hunting and feeding at night and sleeping during the day on self-made platforms in tree branches. It also has been found resting in tree hollows, under tree roots, or among rocks. It is slow-moving and somewhat sluggish, sometimes mistaken for sloths, other possums, or even monkeys. Unlike its close relatives, the common <b>spotted</b> <b>cuscus</b> has been observed feeding during the day on rare occasions.|$|E
50|$|The blue-eyed <b>spotted</b> <b>cuscus</b> or Biak <b>spotted</b> <b>cuscus</b> (Spilocuscus wilsoni) is {{a species}} of {{marsupial}} in the family Phalangeridae. It is endemic to the islands of Biak and Supiori in the Cenderawasih Bay in West Papua of Indonesia. Only scientifically described in 2004, {{it appears to be}} very rare, likely due to hunting and habitat loss, and has consequently been rated as critically endangered by the IUCN. Recent surveys have failed to find any wild individuals. Unlike all other members of the genus Spilocuscus, this relatively small species has distinct pale blue eyes.|$|E
50|$|Much of {{the river}} is bordered by fig-dominated gallery rainforests which provide habitat for animals such as the white-tailed rat, <b>spotted</b> <b>cuscus</b> and palm cockatoo. Toothless catfish {{are found in the}} river.|$|E
50|$|The common <b>spotted</b> <b>cuscus</b> {{lives in}} rainforests, mangroves, {{hardwood}} and eucalypt forests below 1200 m; {{unlike most of}} its relatives, it is not restricted to rainforest environments. Because it lives in dense wooded habitats, it is not easily seen, especially in Australia.|$|E
50|$|The curled, prehensile tail is a {{distinctive}} {{characteristic of the}} common <b>spotted</b> <b>cuscus.</b> The {{upper part of the}} tail closest to the body is covered in fur, while the lower half is covered in rough scales on the inside surface to grip branches.|$|E
50|$|The YUS area {{provides}} {{habitat for}} 268 species of bird, 44 species of mammal and 26 species of frog. Birds include the palm cockatoo, dwarf cassowary, Pesquet's parrot, emperor bird-of-paradise, Wahnes's parotia and Huon astrapia. Mammals include the common <b>spotted</b> <b>cuscus,</b> striped possum, small dorcopsis, Brown's pademelon and mountain cuscus.|$|E
50|$|The Admiralty Island cuscus or Manus Island <b>spotted</b> <b>cuscus</b> (Spilocuscus kraemeri) is {{a species}} of {{marsupial}} in the family Phalangeridae. It is endemic to the Admiralty Islands of Papua New Guinea. It is the smallest member of the genus Spilocuscus, and the female has a black back, while the male has blackish spots on a white background. Both genders have rufous heads.|$|E
50|$|The Waigeou cuscus or Waigeou <b>spotted</b> <b>cuscus</b> (Spilocuscus papuensis) is {{a species}} of {{marsupial}} in the family Phalangeridae. It is endemic to the island of Waigeo in Indonesia, and consequently the spelling Waigeo cuscus is often used instead of Waigeou cuscus. Unlike all {{other members of the}} genus Spilocuscus, both genders are whitish with black spots. It remains fairly common, but its small range makes it vulnerable to habitat loss and hunting.|$|E
50|$|It is {{debated whether}} {{cuscuses}} originated in Australia and then migrated to New Guinea, or vice versa. It {{is believed that}} over the past million years there have been waves of migration during periods of low sea levels that exposed seabed across the Torres Strait. Currently the common <b>spotted</b> <b>cuscus</b> resides in Cape York, Queensland, in northeastern Australia, as well as New Guinea and nearby smaller islands. It inhabits areas as far west as Sulawesi and as far east as the Solomon Islands.|$|E
5000|$|With most of {{the range}} being about 450 m , and with a high point of 824 m, just {{north-east}} of Coen. The major peaks are Mount Carter, Mount White, Mount Newberry, and Mount Walsh. The range is largely vegetated {{with a variety of}} rainforest types, forming the southernmost limit of the ranges of many plants and animals characteristic of New Guinea. These include the <b>spotted</b> <b>cuscus,</b> green tree python and palm cockatoo. [...] An endemic species is the McIlwraith leaf-tailed gecko (Orraya occultus).|$|E
50|$|The common <b>spotted</b> <b>cuscus</b> is {{typically}} a solitary creature, feeding and nesting alone. Interactions with others, especially between competing males, can be aggressive and confrontational. Male cuscuses scent mark their territory to warn off other males, emitting a penetrating musk odor both from {{their bodies and}} scent gland excretions. They distribute saliva on branches and twigs of trees to inform others of their territory and mediate social interactions. If they encounter another male in their area, they make barking, snarling, and hissing noises, and stand upright to defend their territories. They are aggressive, and can scratch, bite, and kick potential predators.|$|E

50|$|It has thick, woolly fur {{of varying}} colours {{depending}} on age, sex, and location. Males are typically grey/white or brown/white with splotchy patterns {{on their back}} and a white underbelly. Only males have spots. Females are usually white or grey and unspotted. Some completely white individuals are known in both males and females. As the young grow, they go {{through a series of}} color changes before reaching sexual maturity around one year old. Colouration varies from reds and whites to buffs, browns, light greys, and blacks. Unlike some other species of cuscuses or possums, the common <b>spotted</b> <b>cuscus</b> does not have a dorsal stripe on its fur.|$|E
50|$|Much of {{the river}} is bordered by gallery rainforests which provide habitat for animals such as the white-tailed rat, <b>spotted</b> <b>cuscus</b> and palm cockatoo. During the wet season the river floods, {{replenishing}} the wetlands. With some 48 species, the river contains the highest diversity of freshwater fish of all Australian rivers, {{many of which are}} shared with the rivers of southern New Guinea. They include Buffon's river garfish and fimbriate gudgeon, as well as the freshwater sawfish and more common species such as the sooty grunter, saratoga and barramundi. The river is also home to one of Queensland’s largest breeding populations of the saltwater crocodile.|$|E
50|$|The common <b>spotted</b> <b>cuscus</b> {{is about}} the size of a common house cat, {{weighing}} 1.5 to 6 kg, body size about 35 to 65 cm long, and a tail 32 to 60 cm long. It has a round head, small hidden ears, thick fur, and a prehensile tail to aid in climbing. Its eyes range in colour from yellows and oranges to reds, and are slit much like a snake's. All four of its limbs have five digits and strong, curved claws, except the first digit on each foot. The second and third digits of the hind foot are partly syndactylous: they are united by skin at the top joint, but divide at the claws. These smaller claws can serve as hair combs when cleaning. The first and second digits of the fore foot are opposable to the other three, helping it grip branches while climbing. The undersides of its paws are bare and striated, which also help it grasp trees and food. The first digit on the hind foot is clawless and opposable.|$|E
5000|$|Blue {{eyes are}} rare in mammals; {{one example is}} the {{recently}} discovered marsupial, the blue-eyed <b>spotted</b> <b>cuscus</b> (Spilocuscus wilsoni). The trait is hitherto known only from a single primate other than humans - Sclater's lemur (Eulemur flavifrons) of Madagascar. While some cats and dogs have blue eyes, this is usually due to another mutation that is associated with deafness. But in cats alone, there are four identified gene mutations that produce blue eyes, some of which are associated with congenital neurological disorders. The mutation found in the Siamese cats is associated with strabismus (crossed eyes). The mutation found in blue-eyed solid white cats (where the coat color is caused by the gene for [...] "epistatic white") is linked with deafness. However, there are phenotypically identical, but genotypically different, blue-eyed white cats (where the coat color is caused by the gene for white spotting) where the coat color is not strongly associated with deafness. In the blue-eyed Ojos Azules breed, there may be other neurological defects. Blue-eyed non-white cats of unknown genotype also occur at random in the cat population.|$|E

40|$|THE common <b>spotted</b> <b>cuscus</b> Spilocuscus maculatus is a {{relatively}} large nocturnal arboreal possum with a preference for tropical lowland forests. Its distribution is centred on New Guinea, but extends to some adjacent landmasses, including a number of satellite islands and Cape York Peninsula in Australia (Flannery 1994; Winter and Leung 1995; Heinsohn 2000). It appears to be principally folivorous and partially frugivorous and forages in the canopy, sub-canopy, and understorey of tropical forests, though it may venture to the ground to cross gaps. After a night of foraging, S. maculatus typically rests by day hidden amidst the thick foliage of the canopy, in liana tangles or thickets, {{and appears to be}} less dependent on, or less inclined to use tree hollows than som...|$|E
