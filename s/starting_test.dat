The best Klemm L.25Ia of Theo Osterkamp, with Salmson AD.9 engine, earned 11 points. The British aircraft were handicapped by lack of starters, and the best crews - Miss Spooner and Lady Bailey, got 6 points, while H. Broad got 4 points. On the other hand, F. Morzik and R. Poss got only 7 points. On August 3 there was a fuel consumption trial on a 304 km distance. The best in fuel consumption were light RWD-2s, then German Klemms and BFWs, but 17 aircraft scored maximum of 30 pts and point differences between most of other aircraft were not big. The German Walter Spengler (Klemm L.25) was disqualified for not carrying his spare propeller aboard during this trial. Hubert Broad was still the leader, but F. Morzik was only one point behind.|$|E

40|$|In the CNS, Bcl- 2 is an antiapoptotic gene {{involved}} in the regulation of neuronal death. Transgenic mice overexpressing the human gene Bcl- 2 (Hu-bcl- 2 mice) showed delayed acquisition in two tasks requiring them to find a hidden platform starting from either a random or a constant starting location. The same mice were not deficient in another task requiring them to find a visible platform suggesting that the delay observed was not due to motor, visual or motivational deficits in the water. The delay observed in Hu-bcl- 2 mice was {{more important in the}} random <b>starting</b> <b>test</b> in which the allocentric demand for navigation was stronger. The results suggested that allocentric navigation is particularly sensitive to abnormal CNS maturation following the overexpression of the bcl- 2 gene.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} test case {{selection}} from axiomatic specifications whose axioms are quantiter-free first-order formulæ.

Our selection criteria allows us to select test cases by iteratively unfolding an initial target test purpose, given as a formula. The initial reference test set is iteratively split into successive subsets. Each subset of test cases is defined by constraints which are increasingly introduced by the unfolding procedure to ensure an appropriate matching between the current test purpose under unfolding and specification axioms.

40|$|Abstract: Here we {{consider}} the drawing material from the <b>starting</b> <b>test</b> (autumn 2010) of the Chile – Finland comparative study. Altogether pupils from 10 classes (N = 153) have drawn a picture on mathematics lesson. Thus we tried to reveal third-graders ’ conceptions on mathematics and its teaching from these drawings. In our study, we restrict us in the communication {{to be seen in}} drawings. A typical communication in class seems to be built mainly on three themes: mathematics is nice / easy, mathematics is dull / difficult, and pupils can do mathematics. There is a nine-year comprehensive school in Finland, where all children study in heterogeneous groups, including in mathematics. Teaching in schools is regulated by the national curriculum (NBE 2004). Teaching mathematics in elementary grades is usually concentrated around the use of textbooks (cf. Perkkilä 2002). Details on mathematics teaching in Finland can be found e. g. in the book Pehkonen & al. (2007). Here we aim to clarify third-graders ’ (about ten-year olds) conceptions of mathematics and mathematics teaching through their drawings. PUPILS ’ DRAWINGS AS A RESEARCH OBJEC...|$|E

40|$|Copyright © 2004 SAE International A major {{manufacturer}} of small engines has recently implemented cold and hot <b>start</b> <b>tests</b> {{on the assembly}} lines {{of one of its}} engines. The cold <b>start</b> <b>test</b> refers to the test in which the engine is motored for a short time. Since this is a motored test, with no combustion occurring in the cylinder, the objective of this test is the detection of manufacturing and assembly defects. Next the engine undergoes a hot <b>start</b> <b>test,</b> in which fuel and air are supplied and the engine is started under a predefined load condition. This is a test performed to verify the performance of the engine under the application conditions. In both tests, typically multiple parameters are measured and extracted to assess the mechanical and thermal performance of the engine. Since noise level and sound quality of small engines have become major concerns for application manufacturers and end-users, an investigation was performed to assess the feasibility of including NVH parameters in the test criteria. Furthermore, some of the NVH parameters can be used to improve and refine the detection of mechanical defects in the cold <b>start</b> <b>test</b> and to detect abnormal combustion phenomena (knock, misfire) in the hot <b>start</b> <b>test.</b> This paper will describe the process and the tools used in the investigation along with all testing, signal processing and correlation methods. Conclusions related to the usefulness and feasibility of NVH parameters and to the efficiency of the test stands will also be presented...|$|R
40|$|In a 4 week double masked {{comparative}} study, patients received 2 % nedocromil sodium (48), 2 % {{sodium cromoglycate}} (48), or placebo eye drops (42), four times daily, {{for the treatment}} of vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC). Clinical examinations of eye condition and symptom severity were made before and after a 1 week baseline before <b>starting</b> <b>test</b> treatment, and after 1, 2, and 4 weeks of treatment. Patients kept daily diary card records of symptom severity and concomitant therapy. At the clinic, significant improvements were seen with both active treatments after 2 - 4 weeks. During the final visit, significant benefits over placebo were recorded for five ocular signs with nedocromil sodium and three with sodium cromoglycate, bulbar and lower tarsal chemosis being better controlled by nedocromil sodium (p < 0. 05 v sodium cromoglycate). Diary card trends showed improvement with all three treatments, which was greatest with nedocromil sodium and least with placebo. Compared with placebo, both the active drugs produced statistically significant improvements in general eye condition during weeks 1 - 2, and nedocromil sodium significantly reduced itching within the first week. Overall, nedocromil sodium had the greatest effect on symptoms, although diary card data revealed no statistically {{significant differences between the two}} active drugs. In conclusion, both 2 % nedocromil sodium and 2 % sodium cromoglycate were effective in controlling VKC when administered four times daily into the eyes, while the marked anti-inflammatory activity of nedocromil sodium was apparent in its more pronounced overall therapeutic effect...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} to determine the problems involved in an emergency method of guiding a gliding vehicle from high altitudes to a high key position (initial position) above a landing field. A jet airplane in a simulated flameout condition, conventional ground-tracking radar, and a scaled wire for guidance programming on the radar plotting board {{were used in the}} tests. <b>Starting</b> <b>test</b> altitudes varied from 30, 000 feet to 46, 500 feet, and starting positions ranged 8. 4 to 67 nautical miles from the high key. Specified altitudes of the high key were 12, 000, 10, 000 or 4, 000 feet. Lift-drag ratios of the aircraft of either 17, 16, or 6 were held constant during any given flight; however, for a few flights the lift-drag ratio was varied from 11 to 6. Indicated airspeeds were held constant at either 160 or 250 knots. Results from these tests indicate that a gliding vehicle having a lift-drag ratio of 16 and an indicated approach speed of 160 knots can be guided to within 800 feet vertically and 2, 400 feet laterally of a high key position. When the lift-drag ratio of the vehicle is reduced to 6 and the indicated approach speed is raised to 250 knots, the radar controller was able to guide the vehicle to within 2, 400 feet vertically and au feet laterally of the high key. It was also found that radar stations which give only azimuth-distance information could control the glide path of a gliding vehicle as well as stations that receive azimuth-distance-altitude information, provided that altitude information is supplied by the pilot...|$|E

Flight tests will be conducted by NASA Dryden Flight Research Center {{off the coast of}} California over water in the Pacific Test Range. The NASA/USAF/industry project is a natural extension of the Hyper-X Program (X- 43 A), which will demonstrate short duration (approximately 10 seconds) gaseous hydrogen-fueled scramjet powered flight at Mach 7 and Mach 10 using a heavy-weight, largely heat sink construction, experimental engine. The X- 43 C Project will demonstrate sustained accelerating flight from Mach 5 to Mach 7 (approximately 4 minutes) using a flight-weight, fuel-cooled, scramjet engine powered by much denser liquid hydrocarbon fuel. The X- 43 C DV design flows from integrating USAF HyTech developed engine technologies with a NASA Air-Breathing Launch Vehicle accelerator-class configuration and Hyper-X heritage vehicle systems designs.
