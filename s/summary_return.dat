Nontechnical <b>Summary</b> <b>Returns</b> to Education: Evidence from UK Twins A particularly robust correlation in economics is that more educated people have higher earnings. Does this mean that a randomly selected person who invests in more education will earn higher wages? Two opposing interpretations have been proposed: a) That the relation is causal: education raises productivity and higher productivity raises wages. b) That the relation is spurious: more able people (higher ability, more favourable family background) are more productive and get a higher wage, but such people acquire more education to signal their high ability and/or because it is easier for them. It is therefore not clear whether a simple relation between earnings and education can be interpreted as a return to education for a randomly selected person. To make such an interpretation, one must convincingly control for factors such as ability and famil...|$|R

Manageable and portable <b>summaries</b> <b>return</b> interactive response times in exploratory data analysis. Obtaining the best estimates for smaller response times and storage needs is the objective of simple data reduction techniques that usually produce coarse approximations. But because the user is exposed to the approximation returned, it is important to determine which queries would not be approximated satisfactorily, in which case either the base data is accessed (if available) or the user is warned. In this paper the accuracy of approximations is determined experimentally for simple data reduction algorithms and several data sets. We show that data cube density and distribution skew are important parameters and large range queries are approximated much more accurately then point or small range queries. We quantify this and other results that should be taken into consideration when incorporating the data reduction techniques into the design. 1...|$|R

40|$|In <b>summary,</b> the <b>returns</b> to {{investment}} in education in Singapore tend to increase {{with years of}} schooling, with the returns to tertiary education generally higher than those for non-tertiary education.

As the structure of Singapore’s economy shifts towards higher value-added and knowledge activities, there will continue to be an increase in the demand for skilled and educated human capital. We can thus expect the demand for workers with tertiary education to increase, which implies that the rate of returns to tertiary education is likely to remain high and above those for secondary and below education. Education will hence continue to be an attractive investment for individuals. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The research was concerned with the relationships that exist between those who distribute and those who receive grants in theatre markets. The aim was to consider questions such as: (i) What is the distribution of grants across repertory theatres {{from each of the}} various sources (Arts Council, local authority, other) ? (ii) What effect does one donor's policy have upon other donors' decisions? (iii) In what way do recipients respond to variations in grant allocation? In the absence of any suitable published statistics, the data set was specially compiled to provide an empirical perspective on these questions. Main Topics : Variables The survey derives from a 'total' (or census) sample of English provincial repertory theatres for the financial years 1977 - 78 to 1980 - 81. From theatres' audited Income and Expenditure Accounts and weekly <b>summary</b> production <b>returns</b> (both sources held by the Arts Council), an extensive set of variables was derived for both theatre activities (production, performances, attendance, etc.) and finances (grants, box-office revenue, other trading revenue, production and other costs, etc.) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} maintaining aggregates over re-cent elements of a massive data stream. Motivated by applications in-volving network data, we consider asynchronous data streams, where the observed order of data may be dierent from {{the order in which}} the data was generated. The set of recent elements is modeled as a sliding times-tamp window of the stream, whose elements are changing continuously with time. We present the rst deterministic algorithms for maintaining a small space summary of elements in a sliding timestamp window of an asynchronous data stream. The <b>summary</b> can <b>return</b> approximate an-swers for the following fundamental aggregates: basic count, the number of elements within the sliding window, and sum, the sum of all element values within the sliding window. For basic counting, the space taken by our summary is O(log W log B (log W + log B) =) bits, where B is an upper bound on the value of the basic count, W is an upper bound on the width of the timestamp window, and is the desired relative error. Our algorithms are based on a novel data structure called splittable his-togram. Prior to this work, randomized algorithms were known for this problem, which provide weaker guarantees than those provided by our deterministic algorithms. ...|$|R
40|$|It is {{straightforward}} to fit multivariate linear models in R with the lm function: Simply specify the lefthand {{side of the}} linear-model formula as a matrix of responses. R also has facilities for testing multivariate linear models via the anova function (as described in Dalgaard, 2007). Although the anova function is very flexible, applied to a multivariate linear model it calculates sequential (often termed “type I”) tests, which rarely are of interest, and performing other common tests, especially for repeated-measures designs, is relatively inconvenient. In contrast, the Anova function in the car package (associated with Fox and Weisberg, 2011) can perform partial tests for the terms in a multivariate linear model, either obeying the principle of marginality (“type II ” tests) or violating it (“type III ” tests), including simply specified multivariate and univariate tests for repeated-measures models. In addition, the linearHypothesis function in the car package can test arbitrary linear hypothesis for multivariate linear models, including models for repeated measures. Both the Anova and linearHypothesis functions and their associated <b>summary</b> methods <b>return</b> a variety of information useful in further computation on multivariate linear models, such as the graphical display of hypothesis tests (see, e. g., Fox et al., 2009).

40|$|Abstract Background The Integrated Management of Childhood Illness Strategy (IMCI) is {{effective}} in improving management of sick children, and thus child survival. It is currently recommended that in-service IMCI case management training (ICMT) occur over 11 -days; that the participant: facilitator ratio should be ≤ 4 : 1 and that at least 30 % of ICMT time be spent on clinical practice. In 2006 – 2007, approximately ten years after IMCI implementation, we conducted a multi-country exploratory questionnaire survey to document country experiences with ICMT, and to determine the acceptability of shortening duration of ICMT. Methods Questionnaires (QA) were sent to national IMCI focal persons in 27 purposively-selected countries. To probe further, questionnaires (QB and QC respectively) were also sent to course-directors or facilitators and IMCI trainees, selected using snowball sampling after applying pre-defined criteria, in these countries. Questionnaires gathered quantitative and qualitative data. Results Thirty-three QA, 163 QB, 272 QC and two <b>summaries</b> were <b>returned</b> from 24 countries. All countries continued to adapt course content to local disease burden. All countries offer shorter ICMT courses, ranging from 3 – 10 days (commonest being 5 – 8 days). The shorter ICMT courses offer fewer exercises, more homework, less individual feedback and reduced clinical practice (Conclusion Whilst the 11 -day ICMT course is still recommended, as efforts intensify to increase access to quality care and meet MDG 4, standardized shorter ICMT courses, that include participatory methodologies and adequate clinical practice, could be acceptable globally. </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{changes in}} {{quality of life}} (QOL) following orthognathic surgery in patients with dentofacial deformity, using generic health, generic oral health, and condition-specific QOL approaches. Materials and Methods: Thirty-six patients were evaluated at baseline presurgical (T 0), 6 weeks postoperatively (T 1), and 6 months postoperatively (T 2). Generic health-related QOL was assessed using the 36 -item Short Form Health Survey (SF- 36), generic oral health-related QOL was assessed by the 14 -item Short Form Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP- 14), and condition-specific QOL was assessed by the 22 -item Orthognathic Quality of Life Questionnaire (OQLQ). Results: There was a significant reduction (deterioration) in SF- 36 summary physical (P <. 01) and mental health scores (P <. 001) at 6 weeks after surgery but no significant change in overall OHIP- 14 or OQLQ scores. At 6 months after surgery, SF- 36 <b>summary</b> scores <b>returned</b> to baseline levels and significant reduction (improvements) in OHIP- 14 (P <. 001) and OQLQ mean scores (P <. 001) were observed. Conclusions: Significant changes in QOL occurred following orthognathic surgery.

Oral Health & Quality of Life: {{abstract}} no. 2453 Oral complications following conventional radiotherapy to {{the head}} and neck are substantial and seriously affect patient quality of life. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is considered to yield fewer complications and thus may be less deleterious to oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL). Objective: To assess the impact of IMRT on the OHRQoL of southern Chinese with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Method: 58 newly diagnosed southern Chinese NPC patients (41 males, 17 females; mean age 47 ± 10 years; Tumour stage T 1 or 2) took part in a prospective study. Evaluation points were before IMRT, then 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after treatment. At each session, participants completed the OHIP- 49 questionnaire. Repeated measures ANOVA test was used to compare changes over time. Results: At 2 months, there were significant increases across all mean OHIP subscale and summary scores (P< 0. 01). At 6 months, physical pain, psychological discomfort and social disability scores returned to baseline.

40|$|Background: Indigenous Australians have poorer {{outcomes}} {{from cancer}} {{for a variety}} of reasons including poorer participation in screening programs, later diagnosis, higher rates of cancer with poor prognosis and poorer uptake and completion of treatment. Cancer prevention and support for people with cancer is part of the core business of the State and Territory Cancer Councils. To support sharing of lessons learned, this paper reports an environmental scan undertaken in 2010 in cancer councils (CCs) nationwide that aimed to support Indigenous cancer control. Methods: The methods replicated the approach used in a 2006 environmental scan of Indigenous related activity in CCs. The Chief Executive Officer of each CC nominated individuals for interview. Interviews explored staffing, projects, programs and activities to progress cancer control issues for Indigenous Australians, through phone or face-to-face interviews. Reported initiatives were tabulated using predetermined categories of activity and <b>summaries</b> were <b>returned</b> to interviewees, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Subcommittee and Chief Executive Officers for verification. Results: All CCs participated and modest increases in activity had occurred in most states since 2006 through different means. Indigenous staff numbers were low and no Indigenous person had yet been employed in smaller CCs; no CC had an Indigenous Board member and efforts at capacity building were often directed outside of the organisation. Developing partnerships with Indigenous organisations were ongoing. Acknowledgement and specific mention of Indigenous people in policy was increasing. Momentum increased following the establishment of a national subcommittee which increased the profile of Indigenous issues and provided collegial and practical support for those committed to reducing Indigenous cancer disparities. Government funding of “Closing the Gap” and research in the larger CCs have been other avenues for increasing knowledge and activity in Indigenous cancer control. Conclusions: This environmental scan measured progress, allowed sharing of information and provided critical assessment of progress across areas of importance for increasing Indigenous cancer control. Structured examination of policies, institutional support systems, programs and interventions is a useful means of highlighting opportunities for progress with minority groups relevant for many organisations. Progress has occurred with momentum likely to increase in the future and benefit from commitment to long-term monitoring and sharing of achievements...|$|R
40|$|For decades, New Zealand’s charity {{sector has}} been able to operate, {{unfettered}} by regulation and with low levels of accountability. For this reason, gaining any information from charities about the work they do has been historically difficult, because charities have not been required to provide any reports. The New Zealand government sought to increase the accountability from the charity sector with the introduction of the Charities Act (2005) and basic reporting requirements, but ultimately, the accountability from the sector continues to be an issue. With limited charity disclosure literature in the New Zealand context, and no information disclosure practice model to guide New Zealand’s charities, the current provision {{and the quality of the}} information disclosures from charities are low, leaving the information needs of charity stakeholders unmet. The overall aim of this investigation is to improve the accountability from New Zealand’s charities by developing a charity information disclosure practice model from a charity stakeholder perspective. This was achieved by three main objectives: 1. 	To develop a qualitative disclosure index from the perspective of charity stakeholders 2. 	To assess the extent and quality of the information disclosure made by thirty registered charities 3. 	To make recommendations to improve the accountability by New Zealand’s charity sector To achieve this purpose, a disclosure index, which contained 136 information items was created with the assistance of 86 charity stakeholders. The index was then applied to three publications from thirty charities that were randomly selected from the Charity register. The three publications used in this investigation are the Charity register, the charity’s website and the charity’s annual report/annual review. The collected data was then quantified and analysed to determine the extent and the quality of the information disclosures from the charities. The investigation findings indicated that the current level of charity disclosures was poor both in extent and quality and that there was an information gap between the expectations of charity stakeholders and the actual disclosure practices of the charities. It was found that the top-performing information items were the mandated and the best-practice information items were either missing or inadequately disclosed. No charity within the sample managed to achieve an index score of 50 %. The annual <b>return</b> <b>summary</b> found on the Charity register was the best disclosure document for both financial and non-financial information items from a charity stakeholder perspective. However, this document, along with the other publications still lacked sufficient detail to be useful for a charity stakeholder. To improve the accountability of the New Zealand’s sector, it is recommended that the New Zealand Parliament look at expanding the current annual <b>return</b> <b>summary</b> to include information items more relevant to charity stakeholders.

Techniques for Telecommunications database visualization for network optimization, Semiconductor design and testing, and methods for high quality scalar field visualization using surface reduction and texture mapping are described. The common theme in these applications {{is the use of}} a visual user interface (VUI). Visual User Interfaces Understanding complexity, involving the conversion of appropriate data to relevant information, is a critical role for visualization. To improve understanding requires maintaining a high level of human involvement and participation in the processing and analysis of data through visual interaction. While noninteractive techniques such as statistical analysis and static graphs can uncover relationships and patterns in large data sources, visual tools incorporates the power of an additional analysis tool; the human eye. By interacting with visual images, the user is able to “explore ” data and achieve a greater understanding of complexity. Direct-manipulation visual user interface tools provide intuitive and interactive user interfaces that maximize information content. Users not only view data, but also explore what they see. Picking, drilling, or roaming inside data spaces are used to <b>return</b> <b>summary</b> information, launch additional queries into the data store, and propagate the applications interface components with particular information, thus promoting the process of discovery. With a visual user interface, the on-screen image becomes concrete, immediate, and primary. The onscreen data object is “live ” [...] the object itself includes underlying data structures and properties, not merely a reporting window. The sense of immediacy and “speed-of-thought ” interaction provides a superior interface for users...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if there was an association between current level of conflict between divorced parents and their attendance or nonattendance at the divorce education pilot program. A telephone interview was used to examine current level of postdivorce conflict. The first portion of the telephone interview used questions that were taken from the Family of Origin Scale (FOS). Questions were selected as they related to various stages of divorce. The second portion of the questionnaire obtained sociodemographic data. as well as information regarding relitigation. The telephone interview was administered to 160 individuals who participated in the divorce education pilot program and to 59 individuals who did not participate. Hypothesis one stated that attendance at the divorce education program will not be associated with the current level of postdivorce conflict. This hypothesis was rejected as a statistically significant association between postdivorce conflict and class attendance was demonstrated. Both males and females in the nonattendance group had higher mean conflict scores than the attendance group. Also, females in both groups had higher mean conflict scores than their male counterparts. Hypothesis two stated that attendance at the divorce education program will not be associated with the number of custody and visitation legal issues since the initial custody arrangement. Hypothesis two was also rejected as attendance at the divorce education class was found to be weakly associated with whether a subject will return to court or not. A demographic <b>summary</b> for subjects <b>returning</b> to court was also created. The need for continued research on postdivorce conflict was addressed. The theoretical implications of the study were highlighted. as well as other recommendations concerning the role of marriage and family therapists who work with families experiencing divorce...|$|R
40|$|This article takes a {{critical}} look at the equity premium puzzle—the inability of standard intertemporal economic models to rationalize the statistics that have characterized U. S. financial markets over the past century. A <b>summary</b> of historical <b>returns</b> for the United States and other industrialized countries and {{an overview of the}} economic construct itself are provided. The intuition behind the discrepancy between model prediction and empirical data is explained. After detailing the research efforts to enhance the model’s ability to replicate the empirical data, I argue that the proposed resolutions fail along crucial dimensions. lmost two decades ago, Edward Prescott and I (see Mehra and Prescott 1985) challenged the profession with a poser: The historical U. S. equity premium (the return earned by a risky security in excess of that earned by a relatively risk free U. S. T-bill) is an order of magnitude greater than can be rationalized {{in the context of the}} standard neoclassical paradigm of financial economics. This regularity, dubbed “the equity premium puzzle, ” has spawned a plethora of research efforts to explain it away. In this article, I take a retrospective look at the puzzle and critically evaluate the various attempts to solve it. 1 A Empirical Facts Historical data provide a wealth of evidence documenting that for more than a century, U. S. stock returns have been considerably higher than returns for T-bills. As Table 1 shows, the average annual real return (that is, the inflation-adjusted return) on the U. S. stock market for the past 110 years has been about 7. 9 percent. In the same period, the real return on a relatively riskless security was a paltry 1. 0 percent. The difference between these two returns, 6. 9 percentage points (pps), is the equity premium. This statistical difference has been even more pronounced in the post-World War II period. Siegel’s (1998) data on U. S. stock and bond returns going back to 1802 reveal a similar, although somewhat smaller, premium for the past 200 years.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} ADRN {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Register of Charities collects information regarding all registered charities in England and Wales since 1963, and electronic records are available from 1993. All charities with an annual income of more than £ 5, 000 in England and Wales must register with the Charity Commission. There are approximately 180, 000 diverse registered charities in England and Wales. A charity is any organisation with aims and objectives which are wholly for the public benefit and of charitable purpose. There are around 13 different categories of charitable classification covering areas such as poverty, education, religion, health, and community development. There are numerous benefits for an organisation to be of charitable status, including {{the ability to be}} able to obtain grants and apply for funding more easily, certain tax relief and reduced business rates for premises. The Charity Commission regulate charities under the framework set down by the Charities Act 2006. Local branches of a charity would only register with the Charity Commission if they are independent and control their own funds. The Charity Commission was established in 1853 and the Charities Act 1960 established the register of charities. There have been several amendments to this Act and the latest revision was in 2006. The Charity Commission manages the use of the Charity Register data for research purposes. Registered charities must supply the Charity Commission with an Annual Return and make available accounts and reports for inspection each year. The information submitted by a charity in their Return is dependent on the level of financial income it receives. It can include detailed information on income and expenditure, employee numbers, purpose of charity, the client group and geographical areas of operation. More specifically, each charity has a period of ten months following their own financial year end to file their Return with the Charity Commission. The Charity Commission can make available monthly extracts of the Register for research purposes. All charities must keep their Register entry up to date and notify the Commission of any changes. Charities with an income greater than £ 10, 000 must submit an Annual Return which includes information about income and expenditure details, contact details, purpose, beneficiaries, how and where it operates, current activities and volunteer numbers. Charities with an annual income greater than £ 500, 000 must provide a more detailed breakdown of their income and expenditure, their assets and liabilities, and employee numbers. Charities with an annual income greater than £ 1, 000, 000 must also submit a <b>Summary</b> Information <b>Return</b> (SIR) which provides qualitative and quantitative data on a charity’s strategy, achievements, income and expenditure. All charities with an annual income greater than £ 25, 000 must also submit a complete set of financial accounts. Copies of these accounts and Trustee Annual Reports are made as part of a charity’s entry on the Register. Where necessary, charities must also submit a Serious Incident Report when there is a significant loss of funds or risks to a charity’s beneficiaries, resources or reputation. The Charities Commission hold records on registered charities from 1963. Computerised records are available from 1993. However some electronic historical data may also be available. At present the Charity Commission only displays information on its website for each registered charity relating to its latest financial year. Historical records are kept on the Charity Commission’s historic database but are not currently publicly available on the website. The Charity Commission regulates charities in England and Wales only. Scottish charities are regulated by the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR). The Charity Commission for Northern Ireland (CCNI) regulates charities in Northern Ireland. The information available on the Register of Charities, and as an extract, is provided directly by charities in their Annual Return or Update. Annual Returns made by charities to the Charity Commission is governed by the Charities Act 2006 and is therefore of a high standard. A small number of data fields in the current Annual Return, such as volunteer numbers and overseas spending outside England & Wales, are optional fields for charities to complete. The Charity Commission usually adopts this approach for the first couple of years when introducing new data fields to the Annual Return. &# 160; The Charities Act 2006 stipulates that all charities with an income of £ 5, 000 or greater must register with the Charity Commission. Prior to this time all charities with an annual income of £ 1, 000 or greater had to register. Charities with an income less than £ 5, 000 do not need to register with the Charity Commission but note they will still benefit from charitable status. From 1 st April 2008, there are thirteen different categories of charitable purpose. Charities registered prior to this registered under four categories, which continue to be charitable and are detailed as follows&# 58; The relief of hardship The advancement of education The advancement of religion Certain other purposes {{for the benefit of the}} community. Certain types of charities do not have to register with the Charity Commission but are still regulated by them. These are known as ‘excepted’ charities and cover churches and chapels of some Christian denomination, charitable service funds of the armed forces and Scout and Guide groups. There are some exempt charities that do not need to register with the Charity Commission because they are supervised by another regulator. This includes most universities in England, charities set up as Industrial and Provident Societies, many national museums and galleries and voluntary and foundation schools. There are no financial penalties for a charity not being registered with the Charity Commission and so some charities may take longer than others to register. Charities have ten months following their financial year end to submit their annual return to the Charities Commission. A charity must be based in England or Wales to register with the Charity Commission but its area of operation is not limited to these boundaries. The latest annual return of a charity published on the Charity Commission’s website may belong to a previous year because of the cyclical nature of reporting. If you are considering using the Charity Commission Register for research purposes then it might be helpful to read through the charity registration process. Full details are available from the Charity Commission’s website. Research Usage and Linkage The Charity Commission Register can be used for a wide range of research purposes including identifying patterns in charity purpose across different geographical areas, the distribution of grants and incomes, the growth and decline in types of charities and assessing the impact of charities objectives (using income and expenditure data). Both the Third Sector Research Centre and the National Council for Voluntary Organisations make extensive use of the Charity Commission Register of Charities data. Recent topics include trends in the concentration of income among charities and the assessment of whether big charities are becoming increasingly dominant. Furthermore, the Charity Commission Register data has also been employed in the publications of New Philanthropy Capital, which is an organisation dedicated to help funders and charities to achieve a greater impact. One example is their 2007 report on child abuse which aims to increase people’s understanding of the issues that can lead to child abuse and to show donors how they can help stop it. At present there is no known research that has linked the Charity Commission Register with other datasets, but some initial efforts are under way in TSRC and CGAP (e. g. linking survey data on voluntary activity and charitable giving to data on the distribution of charities). It may also be possible to use the Charity Commission Register with the Office for National Statistics Inter-departmental Business Register (which contains a ‘non-profit’ flag) to provide a regional perspective on the distribution of charitable activities. </div...|$|R
