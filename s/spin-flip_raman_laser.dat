The Raman cavity was separated from the VECSEL resonator by a tilted dichroic mirror, which steers the Raman beam to an output coupler external to the VECSEL. The spectral emission of the VECSEL, and consequently of the <b>Raman</b> <b>laser,</b> was set by a 4 -mm-thick quartz birefringent filter in the VECSEL cavity. The KGW <b>Raman</b> <b>laser</b> was capable of emitting 2. 5 W at 1315 nm, with M 2 ~ 2. 7 and > 4 % diode-to-Stokes conversion efficiency. The <b>Raman</b> <b>laser</b> emission was tunable from 1295 - 1340 nm, limited by the free spectral range of the birefringent filter. Spectral broadening of the fundamental emission was observed during Raman conversion. At the maximum <b>Raman</b> <b>laser</b> output power, the total linewidth of the VECSEL spectrum was ~ 0 : 7 nm FWHM.
