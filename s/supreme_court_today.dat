50|$|Capron {{was always}} {{concerned}} {{with having a}} good school system. In 1894 a small but enterprising group of Driftwood Township citizens provided {{for the establishment of}} the first Capron Public Schools. The school consisted of grades 1 - 8 and consisted of a two-room frame building located south and east of the present south Coop Grain Elevator. This building proved adequate until 1909 when a new two-story brick building was built in the north end of town {{at the site of the}} present school building. The cost of the 1909 building was $8,500.00. In 1929 residents approved the building of a new one-story building with a large gymnasium and auditorium attached. The old two-story building was torn down to make way for this modern facility. This building was destroyed in the 1939 tornado and a new building, auditorium and gymnasium were built in 1940. At the time, this facility was considered to be one of the best schools in northwest Oklahoma. Additions to the present building were made: in 1952, vocational agriculture building; 1956, additional classrooms and music room; and 1964, when a new cafeteria was added to the school. The high school was first accredited in 1912. In 1968 the high school was closed due to falling enrollment. There were no families in the school district on public assistance in 1968, and the patrons of the district never voted down a tax increase for their school; they wanted the very best for their children. The Elementary School, grades K - 8 were closed in 1976 by a vote of the patrons which carried by only one vote. The vote was contested. This decision was taken to court and eventually upheld by the Oklahoma <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court.</b> <b>Today</b> Capron has two large concrete grain elevators, a rural water district office, United Methodist Church, garage, filling station, and American Legion Post. The Post Office closed in 1994 after 100 years of service to the citizens of the area.|$|E

40|$|Lawyers {{and judges}} {{speak to each}} other in a {{language}} of precedents—decisions from cases that have come before. The most persuasive precedent to cite, of course, is an on-point decision of the U. S. <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court.</b> But <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> opinions are changing. They contain more factual claims about the world than ever before, and those claims are now rich with empirical data. This <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> factfinding is also highly accessible; fast digital research leads directly to factual language in old cases that is perfect for arguments in new ones. An unacknowledged consequence of all this is the rise of what I call “factual precedents”: the tendency of lower <b>courts</b> to cite <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> cases as authorities on factual subjects, as evidence that the factual claims are indeed true. Rather than citing, for example, evidence from the record to establish that carpal tunnel syndrome regularly resolves without surgery, lower courts instead cite language from a <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> opinion for that point.

40|$|In the Supreme Court’s {{most closely}} divided cases, one pivotal justice can {{determine}} the outcome. Given this fact, judicial scholars have paid substantial attention to the swing justice. This article makes two theoretical contributions {{to the study of}} the swing justice and this justice’s resulting influence on case outcomes. First, we show that in a substantial number of cases, the justice that casts the pivotal vote is not the median justice on the Court. Second, we argue that the swing justice will typically rely less on attitudinal considerations and more on strategic and legal considerations than the other justices on the Court. The analysis suggests that even among the Court’s most closely divided decisions, which are typically thought to reflect the Court’s most ideologically driven outcomes, the pivotal swing vote is significantly less likely to reflect attitudinal predispositions and more likely to reflect strategic considerations, such as the public’s preferences, and case-specific considerations such as the position advocated by the Solicitor General. The theory and findings suggest that a failure to consider the unique behavior of a pivotal actor—whether on the Supreme Court or any other decision-making body—can lead to incorrect conclusions about the determinants of policy outputs.

40|$|Within the academia, {{two very}} {{different}} groups of legal scholars have devoted {{a great deal of}} attention to Flood v. Kuhn. Those specializing in sports law have either attached Flood as a ridiculous decision that improperly distinguished between baseball and other professional sports, or have praised it for waging guerrilla warfare on the idea that Section 1 of the Sherman Act should apply to intra-league arrangements by owners of the professional sports teams. Those viewing Flood through the lens of statutory interpretation perceive the decision as adhering rigidly to the principle of stare decisis; this rigidity has been both praised and criticized, and Flood has also been attacked for unjustifiably relying on legislative inaction to infer congressional support for earlier precedents. In this Article, an alternative theory is sketched. Although Justice Blackmun 2 ̆ 7 s majority opinion in Flood was eminently sensible in 1972, as a matter of both judge-created sports law doctrine and the legisprudential application of stare decisis, this is no longer the case. In 1972, Justice Blackmun and his colleagues in the majority were justifiably concerned that applying the Sherman Act to professional baseball might ruin our 2 ̆ 2 National Pastime. 2 ̆ 2 However, a brief look at subsequent developments in baseball and in antitrust law clearly demonstrates that the situation has changed. Read in its full context, rather than mechanically, the majority opinion in Flood applies a fact-based legisprudential standard to questions of stare decisis, not the formalistic approach that some have attributed to it. Flood represents neither an unthinking invocation of the dead weight of precedent, nor an unsophisticated and unwarranted deference to a congressional failure to overturn the Court 2 ̆ 7 s prior decisions. Rather, its holding is much more limited. Flood reveals that the Court will adhere to a precedent where it perceives that reliance interests are strong and that the public interest is better served by preserving the precedent. Under this reconsidered view of Flood, the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>today</b> should reach the opposite result and subject baseball to antitrust scrutiny...|$|E
40|$|This Article uncovers the {{forgotten}} complex {{of relationships between}} the U. S. Constitution, citizenship {{and the laws of}} war. The <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>today</b> believes that both noncitizens and citizens who are military enemies in a congressionally-authorized war are entitled to judicially-enforceable rights under the Constitution. The older view was that the U. S. government’s military actions against noncitizen enemies were not limited by the Constitution, but only by the international laws of war. On the other hand, in the antebellum period, the prevailing view was U. S. citizenship should carry with it protection from ever being treated as a military enemy under the laws of war. This Article documents how this antebellum understanding about the protection of U. S. citizenship was challenged and overthrown during {{the first years of the}} Civil War. As articulated by Union statesmen, members of Congress, lawyers, soldiers and publicists, the rebels by seceding and seeking to throw off their allegiance to the United States and its Constitution, had forfeited their right to be protected by the Constitution. Henceforth, all military actions against them would be governed only by the loose standards of the international laws of war - the standards always applicable to foreign enemies. But if, at its option, the United States chose at times to deal with the rebels not as military enemies but as wayward citizens committing civil crimes like treason, then these citizens retained their pre-war constitutional entitlements. Thus the way the United States choose to respond to the rebels determined the applicable legal regime - whether the Constitution and other municipal protections would apply, or only the harsh laws of war. Starting in 1863 in the Prize Cases, and continuing until the end of the century, the Supreme Court decided over 300 cases arising out of the war. The Court adopted and articulated the theories about the relationship between the Constitution, citizenship, and the international laws of war that had been first developed out of the court in the early years of the war. These legal doctrines and understandings prevailed into the mid-twentieth century, until developments like the civil rights revolution and the increasing sense of judicial supremacy began to set the stage for today’s judicial management of the U. S. government’s relationship with military enemies under the aegis of the Constitution...|$|E

By the Queen's Remembrancer Act 1859 that office ceased to exist separately, and the monarch's remembrancer was required to be a master of the court of exchequer.

40|$|Scholars, politicians, {{and legal}} {{commentators}} {{from across the}} ideological spectrum seem {{to agree that the}} U. S. <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> confirmation process is broken and needs to be fixed. Reform proposals vary, but share a common assumption that if we do not do something the legitimacy of the Court will be at risk. This Article presents an alternative view, arguing that the confirmation process is in fact functioning just fine. The way we confirm <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> nominees <b>today</b> is not perfect, but nor is it all that bad. If there is a crisis facing the high <b>Court</b> <b>today,</b> it lies not in the rigors of the confirmation process, but in the growing gap between how scholars understand the role of the Constitution and the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court,</b> and the rhetoric that defines that role during confirmation hearings. Closing that gap, rather than changing the confirmation process, may {{be the best way to}} preserve support for judicial independence in an increasingly diverse and-at the moment-sharply divided nation. We argue that the current confirmation process does three important and underappreciated things, each of which could, if better understood, contribute to a deeper understanding of the role the process plays in our governing system: it provides democratic validation of previously contested constitutional choices made by the Supreme Court; it provides a public forum in which electorally accountable actors argue about what should and should not be considered part of our constitutional consensus; and it provides an opportunity for dialogue between the Court, the Senate, and the public. Each of these features of the current system work to ensure that the long-term constitutional preferences of the people are, over time, embraced by the Court as part of our core constitutional understanding. Moreover, each does so in ways that are distinct from ordinary politics. A better understanding of these features may thus help nudge confirmation discourse past the stale dichotomy of 2 ̆ 2 umpires 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 activists 2 ̆ 2 and toward a better understanding of the value of the Court and the Constitution we actually have...|$|R
