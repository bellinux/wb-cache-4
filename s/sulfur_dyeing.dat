50|$|The most {{important}} {{member of the}} class is Sulfur Black 1. It is produced by the reaction of 2,4-dinitrophenol and sodium sulfide in hot water. Like many <b>sulfur</b> <b>dyes,</b> details on the chemical reactions are poorly understood. It is accepted that the sulfide reduces the nitro groups to aniline derivatives, which are thought to form indophenol-containing intermediates that are further crosslinked by reaction with sulfur. The result are insoluble, high molecular weight species. Sulfur Black 1 is imperfectly understood, and the material is probably heterogeneous. It is speculated to be a polymer consisting of thianthrene and phenothiazine subunits. The so-called <b>sulfur</b> bake <b>dyes</b> are produced from 1,4-diaminobenzene and diaminotoluene derivatives. These dyes are proposed to consist of polymers with benzothiazole subunits.

40|$|Iron-triethonolamine {{complexes}} {{are well}} suited for the indirect reduction of dispersed dyestuffs, e. g., finely dispersed indigo in a dyebath. Experiments to develop basic data for the scale-up of an electrochemical cell usable for the indirect reduction of indigo, vat <b>dyes,</b> and <b>sulfur</b> <b>dyes</b> are described. Planar electrodes show that the current density at the cath-ode is limited by diffusion controlled transport phenomena in the mediator system. The characterization of the iron tn-ethanolamine mediator system is performed by reduction experiments in a divided flow cell with parallel geometry. An optimization of this cell type was achieved with three-dimensional flow through electrodes, leading to high specific elec-trode areas and a good space/time yield with the investigated electrochemical system.

50|$|This {{compound}} is a water-soluble salt, {{and can be}} used as a {{reducing agent}} in aqueous solutions. It is used as such in some industrial dyeing processes, primarily those involving <b>sulfur</b> <b>dyes</b> and vat dyes, where an otherwise water-insoluble dye can be reduced into a water-soluble alkali metal salt (e.g. indigo dye). The reduction properties of sodium dithionite also eliminate excess dye, residual oxide, and unintended pigments, thereby improving overall colour quality.|$|R

40|$|Background & Aims of the Study: water {{pollution}} by synthetic organic dyes is mainly regarded as environmental and ecological critical issues worldwide. In this research, magnetite iron oxide/silica gel nanocomposite (termed as Fe 3 O 4 /SG) was synthesized chemically and then {{used as an}} effective adsorbent for removal of <b>sulfur</b> <b>dyes</b> from aqueous solution. 			Materials and Methods: The various parameters such as pH, sorbent dosage, initial dye concentration, contact time and dye solution temperature were investigated in a batch system. The equilibrium data were analyzed by Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. 			Results: The experimental data fit well with pseudo-second-order kinetic model (R 2 â¥ 0. 998) and conformed better to Langmuir isotherm model (R 2 â¥ 0. 997). The maximum adsorption capacity for Fe 3 O 4 /SG obtained from the Langmuir model was 11. 1 mg/g. Evaluation of thermodynamic parameters proved that the adsorption process was normally feasible, spontaneous and exothermic.

40|$|The liquid-phase {{oxidation}} {{of sodium}} sulfide catalyzed by various {{materials such as}} 4 <b>sulfur</b> <b>dyes,</b> 6 vat dyes, CuSO_ 4, MnSO_ 4, CoSO_ 4, FeSO_ 4, pyrocatechol, and sulfate lignin have been studied, and catalyst activity and selectivity for this oxidation of the employed catalysts have been investigated. Measurement of time-course of concentration of liquid compounds was carried out with a stirred vessel under aeration, while that of a absorption rate of oxygen was performed in a batchwise operation. Oxidation products were Na_ 2 S_ 2, Na_ 2 SO_ 3, and mainly Na_ 2 S_ 20 _ 3. At first, Na_ 2 S_ 2, Na_ 2 SO_ 3 and Na_ 2 S_ 20 _ 3 were formed by oxidation of Na_ 2 S simultaneously, and Na_ 2 S_ 20 _ 3 was also formed by the reaction of Na_ 2 S_ 2 with Na_ 2 S 0 _ 3 subsequently. In general, catalyst activity of <b>sulfur</b> <b>dyes</b> was {{higher than that of}} vat dyes, and that of metal sulfates such as MnSO_ 4, CuSO_ 4, and CoSO_ 4 was particularly high.

50|$|The {{most common}} example is in {{applying}} <b>sulfur</b> <b>dyes</b> and vat dyes; with indigo being a classic case. This is characteristically purple {{but is also}} completely insoluble in water, meaning that it {{cannot be applied to}} clothes directly. It is instead reduced to indigo white (sometimes Leucoindigo), which is water-soluble but colorless. When a submerged fabric is removed from a dyebath of white indigo the dye quickly combines with oxygen in the air and reverts to the insoluble, intensely colored indigo. The reduction step is typically achieved with sodium dithionite, hydroxyacetone and hydrogen, or by electrochemical methods.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sulfur</b> <b>dyes</b> are water-insoluble. In the {{presence}} of a reducing agent and at alkali pH's at elevated temperature of around 80 Â°C, the dye particles disintegrate, which then becomes water-soluble and hence can be absorbed by the fabric. Sodium sulfide or sodium hydrosulfide are suitable reducing agents. Common salt facilitates the absorption. After the fabric is removed from the dye solution, it is allowed to stand in air whereupon the dye is regenerated by oxidation. The regenerated parent dye is insoluble in water. Oxidation can also be effected in air or by hydrogen peroxide or sodium bromate in a mildly acidic solution.|$|R
50|$|It is used {{in water}} {{treatment}} as an oxygen scavenger agent and also as a metals precipitant, in chemical photography for toning black and white photographs, in textile industry as a bleaching, and as a desulfurising and as a dechlorinating agent and in leather trade for the sulfitisation of tanning extracts. It {{is used in}} chemical manufacturing as a sulfonation and sulfomethylation agent. It {{is used in the}} production of rubber chemicals, <b>sulfur</b> <b>dyes</b> and other chemical compounds. It is used in other applications including ore flotation, oil recovery, making dyes, and detergent. It is also used for leather processing in liming operation as unhairing agent.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "direct dye application" [...] {{stems from}} some {{dyestuff}} {{having to be}} either fermented {{as in the case}} of some natural dye or chemically reduced {{as in the case of}} synthetic vat and <b>sulfur</b> <b>dyes</b> before being applied. This renders the dye soluble so that it can be absorbed by the fiber since the insoluble dye has very little substantivity to the fiber. Direct dyes, a class of dyes largely for dyeing cotton, are water-soluble and can be applied directly to the fiber from an aqueous solution. Most other classes of synthetic dye, other than vat and surface dyes, are also applied in this way.|$|R
30|$|More than 0.7 {{million tons}} of organic dyes are {{produced}} each year globally. It is noted that there are over 10, 000 commercially accessible dyes that are classified by their utilization fields, namely acid, reactive, disperse, vat, metal complex, mordant, direct, basic and <b>sulfur</b> <b>dyes.</b> Reactive dyes {{have been identified as}} the most environmentally problematic compounds in textile dye effluents for several reasons. First, reactive dyes are intensively used due to their preferable performance and their increasing market share. Second, they are very soluble and approximately 10 â 15 % of the weight of applied reactive dyes is discharged from the dye houses. Third, conventional wastewater treatment units, which reliance on sorption and aerobic biodegradation, have a low removal output for reactive and other anionic soluble dyes. Consequently, they cause to be colored water channels and public complaints, and the pollutants are being transferred to another phase and not being eliminated (Dojcinovic et al. 2012).|$|R
30|$|A {{previous}} study (Ku and Mun, 2008) revealed that hot water extracts of Bokbunja pulp contained neutral sugars (69.9 %) such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose {{as well as}} anthocyanin (5.2 %). Considering total sugar content, it was speculated that the Bokbunja sludge extract prepared in this study also contained reducing sugars and so, {{it can be used}} as a reducing agent in indigo dyeing. Reducing sugars have been used for reduction processes as possible benign alternative reducing agents for indigo (Meksi et al., 2012) and <b>sulfur</b> <b>dyes</b> (Blackburn and Harvey, 2004). Their reducing effect is associated with an electron-rich intermediate (Vuorema et al. 2009). Employment of food by-products as a source of reducing sugars has the advantage that harmful environmental effects can be avoided.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Using {{ultrafine}} {{carbon black}} (CB) dispersions to dye cotton fabrics back is feasible through an exhaustion procedure. The effects of CB particle size, {{the type of}} dispersants, electrolyte concentration and cationic modification of cotton on the colour yields of CB dyed cotton fabrics have been investigated. CB particle size ranging from 130 nm to 200 nm is appropriate to achieve a deep black shade in cotton fabrics. Cationic dispersant improves the K/S values and wash fastness of the CB dyed cotton fabrics. However, caution should be exercised in adding electrolytes to CB dispersions. Cationic modification of cotton is an effective method to achieve higher K/S values of CB dyed fabrics.

40|$|Colors {{surround}} us and accompany {{us every}} day and everyday steps. However, the concept of color is not as self-evident as we think. The appearance of color is associated with light and is a physical phenomenon. The color is a substance that colored other materials with special techniques. We know natural and synthetic dyes. The first is obtained from natural sources, the other is synthetically derived. Natural dyes are divided into isoprene, pyrrole, pyrimidine, pyran and quinone derivatives, synthesized on azo <b>dyes,</b> <b>sulfur</b> <b>dyes,</b> indigoid dyes, anthracycline and triphenylmethane dyes. Chromatography {{is the process of}} separating substances from the mixture. Different chromatographic divisions are known, depending on the interaction (absorption, distribution, ion - exchange and exclusion), looking at the mobile phase (gas, liquid) depending on the stationary phase apparatus (columnar, planar). This leads to several types of chromatography. Of which the best known are paper chromatography, thin-layer, gas and gel. As simple as a very demanding and complex process, it provides quick and effective results of the separation of the mixture. Due to the simple practical implementation, it can be used as an experiment in primary and secondary schools. With the term chromatography students meet in the 7 th grade of elementary school. Research shows that learning through research is much more interesting for students and knowledge that they get more profound and lasting.
