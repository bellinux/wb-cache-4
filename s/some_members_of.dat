There were also claims that <b>some</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the Ngapa clan were among those who had signed a petition opposing the facility. Political scientist Rebecca Stringer criticised the federal government's approach to the siting of the waste facility, arguing that it undermined the Indigenous owners' sovereignty and {{control of their own}} lands.

5|$|American Cocker Spaniels are {{susceptible}} {{to a variety of}} illnesses, particularly infections affecting their ears and, in some cases, their eyes. Although the number or percent of afflicted dogs is not known, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), glaucoma, and cataracts have been identified in <b>some</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the breed. The American Spaniel Club recommends annual eye exams by a veterinary ophthalmologist for all dogs that are to be used for breeding. Autoimmune problems in Cockers have also been identified in an unknown number or percent of the breed, including autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Ear inflammations are common in drop-eared breeds of dog, including the American Cocker, and luxating patellas and hip dysplasia have been identified in <b>some</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the breed.|$|E

5|$|The {{physical}} characteristics {{seen in the}} breed are currently in flux, so {{there is not a}} single breed phenotype, though many members of the breed closely resemble the Mérens. Enthusiasts are breeding for a rustic mountain horse, of medium size, with good gaits and good temperament. <b>Some</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the breed closely resemble Iberian horses such as the Andalusian horse. The official breed standard calls for a moderately long neck and long, sloped shoulder, broad back, rounded croup and muscular legs. <b>Some</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the breed are branded on the left hindquarter. Because of its relative rarity and physical similarities, the Castillonnais is commonly confused with the Mérens.|$|E

5|$|A natural bobtail can {{be found}} in <b>some</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the breed, which is not a {{mutation}} of the T-box gene, and so is allowed under conformation show rules. Health-related research on the breed has been limited, with no major studies conducted in Britain. However, it has been included in studies outside the UK, including by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) in the United States. The King Charles Spaniel has a number of eye and respiratory system disorders common to brachycephalic dogs, and endocrine and metabolic diseases common to small breeds, as well as specific breed-associated health conditions. The average lifespan is 10 to 12 years, and the breed should be able to reproduce naturally.|$|E
