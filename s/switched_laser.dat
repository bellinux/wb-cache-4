Its first devices were heavily based on hot metal machinery, with glass pictures of characters which would be reproduced on photographic paper replacing the matrices used to cast metal type. While this reduced the need for retraining, the resulting devices often set type slowly compared to legacy-free next-generation devices from providers such as Photon and Compugraphic, and were often more expensive. Its devices were slow to incorporate use of electronics, and while its type library was of high quality, changing tastes {{and the development of}} other companies’ libraries competed with this. Its type library was also easily pirated, since fonts have only limited copyright protection. The company was eventually split into three divisions: Monotype International, which manufactured spinning mirror <b>switched</b> <b>laser</b> beam phototypesetters; Monotype Limited, which continued the hot metal machines; and Monotype Typography, which designed and sold typefaces. A research and development department was set up in Cambridge to isolate it from day to day production issues.|$|E

In the late 80 s, Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifiers were commercialised and became widely used in the telecommunications industry. Yb-doped silica fiber is particularly attractive as its broad gain bandwidth and high optical efficiency make it a preferred choice for both pulsed and c. w. high power fiber laser and amplifier applications. With the advent of cladding pump technology, low cost, high power broad-stripe semiconductor laser diodes with multimoded radiation could be efficiently used to produce high power Yb-doped silica fiber lasers with either single (~ 1 kW) or multimode (~ 10 kW) emission. Finally, the development and demonstration of a novel gain <b>switched</b> <b>laser</b> diode operating at 1 µm is reported. Using this gain <b>switched</b> <b>laser</b> diode as a seed source; the output gain switched pulses were compressed to 20 ps using a fiber compressor and thereafter amplified to achieve an output average power of 11. 1 W at 1 GHz repetition rate using an YDFA cascade.
