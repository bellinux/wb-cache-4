50|$|The {{appearance}} of D1 is also quite distinct from Q1. The facades of D1, designed by Innovarchi (directors Ken McBryde and Stephanie Smith) enhance {{the form of}} the tower and emphasize the sheer nature of the layered glass curtain wall. The primary facades are conceived as a series of layers to protect against the harsh environment. The timber canopy around the base, is inspired by the craft of Dhow trading boat construction that used to occur on the <b>site.</b> <b>Installation</b> of the canopy is expected from September 2012. The undulating timber structure provides a shaded threshold between the air conditioned internal spaces, bright and hot exterior. It also acts as a moderator between three surrounding scales: the High Speed Freeway / Urban Landmark Scale; the Precinct Scale and the Human Scale.|$|E
50|$|With {{the success}} of such projects, {{participating}} scientists began to explore {{the idea of creating}} a global network of sensor sites {{that could be used to}} integrate their data and provide access for the members of the academic community and general public. At a meeting in La Thuile, Italy during 1995, contributing scientists began to discuss the feasibility of such a network. With the successful conclusion of this meeting, there was an increase in the rate of sensor <b>site</b> <b>installation</b> and the growth of regional networks. Eventually, the Euroflux network took hold in 1996 and was soon followed by the AmeriFlux network in 1997. When NASA saw the enthusiasm from the scientific community for these two networks as well as the possibility to integrate trace gas data from the ground with data from the Earth Observatory Satellite, it finally funded the Fluxnet project as a whole in 1998.|$|E
