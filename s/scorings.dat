6000|$|No known agent, save ice, {{can have}} {{produced}} those rounded, and polished, and scored, and fluted rochers moutonnes [...] "sheep-backed rocks"--so {{common in the}} Lake district; so common, too, in Snowdon, especially between the two lakes of Llanberis; common in Kerry; to be seen anywhere, as far as I have ascertained, around the Scotch Highlands, where the turf is cleared away from an unweathered surface of the rock, in {{the direction in which}} a glacier would have pressed against it had one been there. Where these polishings and <b>scorings</b> are found in narrow glens, it is, no doubt, an open question whether some of them may not be the work of water. But nothing but the action of ice can have produced what I have seen in land-locked and quiet fords in Kerry--ice-flutings in polished rocks below high-water mark, so large that I could lie down in one of them. Nothing but the action of ice could produce what may be seen in any of our mountains- -whole sheets of rock ground down into rounded flats, irrespective of the lie of the beds, not in valleys, but on the brows and summits of mountains, often ending abruptly at the edge of some sudden cliff, where the true work of water, in the shape of rain and frost, is actually destroying the previous work of ice, and fulfilling the rule laid down (I think by Professor Geikie in his delightful book on Scotch scenery as influenced by its geology), that ice planes down into flats, while water saws out into crags and gullies; and that the rain and frost are even now restoring Scotch scenery to something of that ruggedness and picturesqueness which it must have lost when it lay, like Greenland, under the indiscriminating grinding of a heavy sheet of ice.|$|E

RESULTS: No signifiCANt difference IN VGA <b>scorINg</b> appeared for CTDIvol as low as 3 mGy IN children under 10 years old (≤ 35 kg), whereas a signifiCANt loss of image quality was noticed when lowerINg the CTDIvol from 10 TO 3 mGy for children IN the 10 TO 16 years groUP (> 35 kg).

40|$|Predictive {{modeling}} {{tools such}} as SAS ® Enterprise Miner ™ generate score code {{that can be applied}} in business applications to produce recommendations. This paper describes a programming interface for scoring clients to invoke scoring services through message queues. The interface is applicable to both "real-time single-observation " scoring and "high-data-volume table-based batch " scoring. Readers learn how to invoke message queue–based scoring services from various scoring clients written in different programming languages such as C++, Java, and the SAS DATA step. Topics discussed include model identification, input data format, output data format, and error handling. The intended audience is data mining practitioners and IT professionals who are responsible for predictive model scoring in operational and business intelligence applications. The SAS DATA step, SAS SCL, and Java languages are used in code snippets; however, familiarity with those languages is not needed in order to grasp the intended points. MODEL BUILDING The focus of this paper is on the scoring programming interface (SPI.) We assume that the score code is available when needed. A plethora of tools, such as SAS Enterprise Miner®, SAS/STAT ® software, and Base SAS can be used to create score code. Score code can exist in many different formats, such as the SAS DATA step, C, C++, Java, and PMML (Predictive Model Markup Language), depending on the needs of scoring execution environments. However, the SPI remains the same regardless of the underlying scoring configurations. ON-DEMAND <b>SCORING</b> There is no standard definition of on-demand scoring, but generally speaking, on-demand scoring is about returning recommendations upon request. On-demand typically means a sub-second for a single-record scoring, while it could also mean a few hours on a multimillion-record-scoring task. In this paper, we focus on one-record scoring in which the scoring client provides complete predictor information. The scoring server can use the key to look up, for example, a database for missing predictor information. On-demand scoring tasks include data mining functions, such as classification, prediction, association, and clustering. This paper will focus on classification and recommendation...|$|R
