The first two numbers come from the unit vector that specifies a rotation axis. The third number designates the angle of rotation of the grain. The final two numbers specify the plane of the grain boundary (or a unit vector that is normal to this plane).|$|E

Natalie's actions make Roman realise that [...] "they're just not suited to each other". However, Coleby said that he hoped there was a future for the characters, but felt it was better that they [...] "move apart for a while".|$|E

Although {{they were killed}} off in the episode, writer Robert Kirkman wanted to evoke a reaction that the characters would recur throughout the series. [...] "With the casting of those two guys and everything involving that scene we were really {{trying to convince the}} audience {{that they were going to}} be new regulars, so the end would be that much more shocking." [...] Kirkman felt that Tony and Dave represent new threats and anxieties for the group. [...] "I think this was a particularly good episode coming back because the two guys in the bar represent new threats and they are really just the tip of the iceberg," [...] he stated. [...] "It's really good to come back and be off of the farm and <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> more dangerous things out there than the zombies.

2500|$|Dennett makes a {{distinction}} between the presence of representation, and the representation of presence. The example he gives regarding this distinction is this: if you were to walk into a room covered in identical portraits of Marilyn Monroe, you would <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> many of them, but you would not really be seeing them all at once. There would be no detailed representation of each individual portrait just the knowledge that they are present. Dennet's theory raises two relevant questions: 1) How does the visual system detect change in the environment? 2) How much information is retained in each saccade? The proposed answer to these questions lies in several mechanisms that support a high sensitivity to change in each visual fixation. These mechanisms are: retinal adaptation, [...] "pop-out" [...] systems, and motion detectors. The implication of this view is that little information is needed to be retained between each saccade.|$|E
2500|$|The {{debate of}} Indian {{involvement}} in this war {{has been a source}} of tension and underlying conflict between India and Bangladesh since the emergence of the war itself. This section examines the role of India in this war by exploring the ways in which India largely contributed to the war and to what extent this aided the Bangladeshis. In exploring the latter, one can <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> several ways in which India aided Bangladesh. For one, India was largely responsible for building the Mukti Bahini from a group of inexperienced rebel fighters to an army formidable enough to fight against the Pakistani army. When the war first broke out it in 1971, the initial state of the Bengali rebels can be understood from the remark of one Bengali rebel officer, who complained that [...] "No one in the Bangladesh cabinet knows anything about war". [...] This construed the dire situation of the army before India’s intervention. The Mukti Bahini was recounted as being “Without any supplies or assistance”. If a weapon became unserviceable the soldier carrying that weapon became useless, since he could not be given another weapon. There was a complete dearth of a “Modern communication system to be in constant touch with troops in different battle locations”. This is evidenced in that the Mukti Bahini’s position was threatened at Kumira, but the army had received the message three hours late because of the poor communication system.|$|E
