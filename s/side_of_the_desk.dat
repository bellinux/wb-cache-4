25|$|An {{ergonomic}} {{feature of}} the Wang PC was the monitor arm that clamped to the desk and held the monitor above and a system clamp that attached to the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> and held the rather large computer box. By using these, there was nothing on the desktop except the keyboard.|$|E
25|$|AMC also {{produced}} a one-off Sportabout for Gucci's personal use. The car was {{powered by a}} 5-litre V8 engine and had a three-speed automatic transmission. The interior featured leather was door panels, cargo area {{as well as the}} front and rear centre arm rests. The doors and custom-designed bucket seats received red and green striped inserts. The instrument panel was given a centrally located, pull-out writing desk, graced with a scribbler and a sterling silver bamboo pen. A map {{light at the end of}} a flexible arm extended from the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk,</b> the left carried a vanity mirror, also on a flex stem. The back of the front seats popped open. The one on the passenger's side served as a snack table or provided a flat surface for playing games. The compartment behind the driver concealed a miniature liquor cabinet, complete with four sterling silver tumbles and two decanters—all decorated with red and green enamel stripes.|$|E
60|$|But the Honourable Hilary {{pointed to}} a chair on the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk.</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{wall behind}} the target {{material}} and the desktop with the monitor arm stand were covered with white canvas. And white canvas curtains were hung {{to the right and}} <b>the</b> left <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk.</b> Besides <b>the</b> visual target material, the only object within <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> vision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subjects was the white canvas.|$|R
50|$|A bureau à gradin is {{an antique}} desk form {{resembling}} a writing table with, in addition, one or several tiers of small drawers and pigeonholes built on part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> desktop surface. Usually the drawers and pigeonholes directly face the user, {{but they can}} also surround three <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk,</b> as is <b>the</b> case for <b>the</b> Carlton house <b>desk</b> form. A small, portable version is a bonheur du jour.|$|R
50|$|Bill Dwyre (born April 7, 1944, in Sheboygan, Wisconsin) is a sportswriter {{and former}} {{newspaper}} sports editor. Notable for his long tenure as sports editor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Los Angeles Times beginning in June 1981, {{he moved to}} the writing ranks full-time in June 2006. But for virtually his whole career he has worked both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk,</b> as an editor and writer, and today writes several weekly columns for the Times.|$|R
60|$|The rector {{held his}} hand across the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> where the skull was and Stephen, placing his hand in it for a moment, felt a cool moist palm.|$|E
60|$|This {{question}} {{was addressed to}} his youngest clerk, who sat on the opposite <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> staring at Mr Jollyboy with that open impudence of expression peculiar to young puppy-dogs whose masters are unusually indulgent.|$|E
60|$|I strolled {{away for}} a few minutes to look into the cafe, where the waiters were {{preparing}} for luncheon. There was no sign of Louis. When I returned, Ashley leaned forward to me from the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk.</b>|$|E
40|$|Photograph of Nevada County Views, showing Doris Foley Library front desk, Nevada City, CA, ca. 1910. In the {{foreground}} at left, {{a small table}} is visible stacked with papers. Three wooden chairs are positioned around the table. Similar tables and chairs {{can be seen in}} the background to the right. At center, a decorative tile floor can be seen leading to the semicircular wooden front desk. Two large columns can be seen on <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk.</b> Behind <b>the</b> <b>desk,</b> at least five large bookcases lined with books can be seen...|$|R
40|$|Photograph of an {{interior}} view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conference room <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Los Angeles County Jail, located on <b>the</b> tenth floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hall <b>of</b> justice, ca. 1940 - 1949. Three rows <b>of</b> <b>desks</b> sit in <b>the</b> rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room, while another desk and a card-file cabinet bearing a sign "Files {{for use of}} officers only" {{sit in the front}} left. <b>The</b> surfaces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rear <b>desks</b> are bisected by low dividers; stools sit on the concrete floor on each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desks.</b> Two panels <b>of</b> barred walls sit at <b>the</b> far end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room. This conference room was used for prisoners and their attorneys...|$|R
50|$|A {{rolltop desk}} is a 19th-century {{reworking}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pedestal <b>desk</b> with, in addition, {{a series of}} stacked compartments, shelves, drawers and nooks in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> user, much like the bureau à gradin or <b>the</b> Carlton House <b>desk.</b> In contrast to these the compartments and <b>the</b> desktop surface <b>of</b> a rolltop desk can be covered {{by means of a}} tambour consisting of linked wooden slats that roll or slide through slots in <b>the</b> raised <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk.</b> In that, it is a descendant in function, and partly in form, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cylinder <b>desk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 18th century. It is a relative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tambour <b>desk</b> whose slats retract horizontally rather than vertically.|$|R
60|$|Tommy lived expecting her. She {{came one}} night when Tommy was alone, working late in the office. Tommy knew her the moment she entered the door, a {{handsome}} woman, with snake-like, rustling skirts. She {{closed the door behind}} her, and drawing forward a chair, seated herself the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk,</b> and the two looked long and anxiously at one another.|$|E
60|$|In his castle at Lustadt, Leopold of Lutha paced nervously {{back and}} forth between his great desk and the window that {{overlooked}} the royal gardens. Upon the opposite <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> stood an old man--a tall, straight, old man with the bearing of a soldier and the head of a lion. His keen, gray eyes were upon the king, and sorrow was written upon his face. He was Ludwig von der Tann, chancellor of the kingdom of Lutha.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Wadham, Senior, was an {{excellent}} replica of his son, a little fatter, a little rosier {{and a little more}} verbose. He rose from behind his desk and bowed twice as his distinguished client entered. The Marquis indicated to Mr. Wadham, Junior, the chair upon which he proposed to sit, and waited while it was wheeled up to the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk.</b> Then he withdrew his gloves in leisurely fashion and extended his hand to the older man, who clasped it reverently.|$|E
60|$|Bob had {{hitherto}} {{avoided the}} counting house. He had occasionally, on previous visits, slipped {{down to his}} friend the foreman; and had wandered through the great cellars, and watched the men at work bottling, and gazed in surprise at <b>the</b> long tiers <b>of</b> casks stacked up to <b>the</b> roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cellar, and the countless bottles stowed away in the bins. Once or twice he had gone down into the counting house, with his uncle; and waited there a few minutes, until the foreman was disengaged. He had noticed Mr. Medlin at work at his high desk, in one corner--keeping, as it seemed to him, his eye upon two young clerks, who sat on high stools at opposite <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk,</b> on <b>the</b> other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> office.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> action <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drama {{had just}} brought that {{emotional}} lady on left centre {{and had taken}} her across to <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> which stood on <b>the</b> other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stage. <b>The</b> <b>desk</b> was an important feature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> play, for it symbolized the absorption in business which, exhibited by her husband, was rapidly breaking Miss Hobson's heart. He loved his desk better than his young wife, that was what it amounted to, and no wife can stand that sort of thing.|$|R
60|$|A man {{of my own}} height, {{complexion}} {{and general}} appearance was standing by <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Magg's <b>desk.</b> <b>The</b> latter looked backwards and forwards rapidly from me to my double.|$|R
60|$|He {{took out}} a drawer on the right--took it out bodily--then {{introduced}} his hand into the opening, running it along the inner <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> until, no doubt, he touched a spring; for suddenly a small trap was opened. From this cavity he fished out two documents--one the flimsy tissue on which King James' later was penned; the other on heavier material Lord Ostermore's reply. He spread the latter before him, {{and handed it to}} Mr. Caryll, who ran an eye over it.|$|E
60|$|The boy {{slipped out}} of the room. Mr. Carey was unused to work, and he turned to his {{correspondence}} with resentment. On one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> was a bundle of bills, and these filled him with irritation. One especially seemed preposterous. Immediately after Mrs. Carey's death Emma had ordered from the florist masses of white flowers for the room in which the dead woman lay. It was sheer waste of money. Emma took far too much upon herself. Even if there had been no financial necessity, he would have dismissed her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{got to help}} you!" [...] {{she said}} to his desk, to his bag of Bull Durham, to his alarm-clock--even to a rather {{shocking}} collection of pictures of chorus-girls and diaphanously-clad dancers which was pasted inside the double drawer on the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk.</b> In her great surge of emotion, she noticed these posturing hussies far less than she did a little volume of Rosetti, or the overshoes whose worn toes suddenly revealed to her that Walter Babson, the editor, was not rich--was not, perhaps, so very much better paid than herself.|$|E
40|$|Interview by Ami Allain with Tina Copeland {{at about}} two o'clock. Originally I was {{supposed}} to interview another person, but {{because she had a}} sudden meeting come up <b>the</b> day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interview Tina Copeland stepped in to be interviewed instead. The interview took place in a little office that was located behind <b>the</b> reception <b>desk</b> on <b>the</b> long term patient care <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hospital. <b>The</b> <b>desk</b> was piled with papers and there was someone else sitting at the computer right next to <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> while <b>the</b> interview went on. At a couple times dur-ing the interview Tina consults her on some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> answers that she is unsure of. Tina is a RN at the hospital...|$|R
50|$|Inside {{the chapel}} is a wooden {{panelled}} reading desk on a moulded plinth with an ogee cornice. On each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reading <b>desk</b> is {{a flight of}} three steps with balusters and newels. The reredos is also panelled, the central panel being wider than the outer panels, and with a semicircular head. The reredos is decorated with motifs including garlands and roses. Also in the chapel are a communion table with communion rails, and a treadle organ.|$|R

Two men work at {{opposite}} <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same <b>desk</b> at center with many documents before them. A man in a lightly-colored suit uses the phone at <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> while a man stands behind him in work clothes and a hat.

60|$|Racked {{by these}} {{conflicting}} impulses of self-preservation {{on the one}} hand and what seemed self-realization on the other, she started when, toward the middle of the afternoon, she heard Ditmar's voice summoning her to take his letters; and went palpitating, leaving the door open behind her, seating herself on the far <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk,</b> her head bent over her book. Her neck, where her hair grew in wisps behind her ear, seemed to burn: Ditmar's glance was focussed there. Her hands were cold as she wrote.... Then, like a deliverer, she saw young Caldwell coming in from the outer office, holding a card in his hand which he gave to Ditmar, who sat staring at it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Joe," [...] {{said the}} clergyman slowly, motioning {{him into a}} chair at the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk,</b> [...] "I know that after this trial Churnside will not be a {{pleasant}} place to hold you. All your neighbours believe, in spite of the verdict, that you killed the vicar. I feel sure, however, that you did not commit this murder. Therefore, as some compensation for the suffering of mind to which you have been put, I think it well to send you and your wife and family to Australia or Canada, whichever you like best. I propose also to make you a present of a hundred pounds, to set you up in your new home." ...|$|E
6000|$|Turning {{her eyes}} from this, Jill became aware that {{something}} was going on at the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk,</b> and she perceived that a second young man, the longest and thinnest she had ever seen, was in the act of rising to his feet, length upon length like an unfolding snake. At the moment of her entry he had been lying back in an office-chair, so that only a merely nominal section of his upper structure was visible. Now he reared his impressive length until his head came within measurable distance of the ceiling. He had a hatchet face and a receding chin, and he gazed at Jill through what she assumed were the [...] "tortoise-shell cheaters" [...] referred to by her recent acquaintance, Mr. Brown.|$|E
50|$|On its own {{elevated}} platform {{in the south}} transept sits an attractive organ made by George Verschueren of Tongeren, Belgium, built in 1988. Drawstops were arranged on each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> key <b>desk</b> and wind was activated from {{a stop on the}} left <b>side.</b> Manuals are <b>of</b> four octaves and the flat pedal board <b>of</b> two-and-a-half octaves. <b>The</b> organ loft railing and organ casework reflect <b>the</b> gothic nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cathedral and all timbers are stained to match <b>the</b> existing woodwork <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church. Pipes are presented in flats with a large central tower and two f1anking small towers in the left and right extremities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case.|$|R
50|$|There {{was also}} {{a change in the}} BBC News 24 set. Upon re-launch in 1999, the {{newsroom}} feel was retained but smartened up with beige and red walls. To either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long <b>desk</b> were two flat screen televisions for linking into sport, weather and to partake in interviews; a large curved half wall went around <b>the</b> rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> separating it from the newsroom. The newsroom featured numerous televisions embedded into the far back wall and attached to a circular display behind <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> suspended from <b>the</b> ceiling. Weather was now presented from the main weather studio used by the terrestrial bulletins and Sport was now presented from its own studio featuring a small desk against a background of ten small televisions embedded into the wall.|$|R
2500|$|Any member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House can {{introduce}} a bill at any time, while the House is in session, by placing (or most likely having a page place) a signed copy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{bill in the}} [...] "hopper" [...] at <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Clerk's <b>desk</b> on <b>the</b> Rostrum. Other members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House may co-sponsor any bill to be introduced in the House by a member. These co-sponsors {{are not required to}} sign the bill and are considered under House Rules to be [...] "original co-sponsors" [...] and [...] "additional co-sponsors" [...] depending on whether they co-sponsored the bill {{at the time it was}} introduced or added their names to the bill after its introduction.|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} hurried away. Duge was still stooping down, {{with his arm}} around Virginia's waist. Gradually she began to recover herself. She looked all round the room, as though in search of some one. Her uncle asked her no questions. He {{saw that she was}} rapidly regaining consciousness, and he waited. Smedley {{returned}} with the brandy. Together they forced a little between her lips, and watched the colour coming back into her cheeks. Then Phineas Duge withdrew his arm and walked to the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk.</b> On the floor were the broken fragments of Virginia's locket. The carpet had been torn up. The steel coffer, with the keys still in it, was there half open. He slid back the lid, and taking out a few of the topmost papers, ran them through his fingers. There was no doubt about it. The document was missing. He returned to the chair to which he had carried Virginia.|$|E
60|$|So Rollo, {{taking out}} half a paul from his pocket,--that being {{the price of}} {{admission}} to the reading room for a single day,--and giving it to the clerk at the desk, opened a door by the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk,</b> and passed into the reading room. Instead of being only one reading room, however, he found that there were two, with an open door leading from one to the other. There were a great number of very comfortable sofas and arm chairs all about these rooms, and great tables in the middle of them covered with newspapers and magazines. The walls of both rooms were completely covered with paintings of all sizes, most of which had been left there for sale. There were a great many gentlemen sitting around the tables and upon the sofas, reading. Among them Rollo soon found Mr. George. He had established himself in a comfortable arm chair, near a great window that looked out upon the square. But he was obliged to keep the curtain down, on account of the beggars outside, that gave him no peace as long as they could see him.|$|E
6000|$|Hunting was over, and {{the east}} wind was still blowing, and a great portion of the London world {{was out of town}} taking its Easter holiday, when, on an {{unpleasant}} morning, Ferdinand Lopez travelled into the city by the Metropolitan railway from Westminster Bridge. It was his custom to go thither when he did go,--not daily like a man of business, but as chance might require, like a capitalist or a man of pleasure,--in his own brougham. But on this occasion he walked down to the river side, and then walked from the Mansion House into a dingy little court called Little Tankard Yard, near the Bank of England, and going through a narrow dark long passage got into a little office at the back of a building, in which there sat at a desk a greasy gentleman with a new hat on one side of his head, who might perhaps be about forty years old. The place was very dark, and the man was turning over the leaves of a ledger. A stranger to city ways might probably have said that he was idle, but he was no doubt filling his mind with that erudition which would enable him to earn his bread. On the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> there was a little boy copying letters. These were Mr. Sextus Parker,--commonly called Sexty Parker,--and his clerk. Mr. Parker was a gentleman very well known and at the present moment favourably esteemed on the Stock Exchange. [...] "What, Lopez!" [...] said he. [...] "Uncommon glad to see you. What can I do for you?" ...|$|E
50|$|The TouchLight {{can both}} record and project simultaneously, {{and due to}} its 3D {{capabilities}} can be used almost as a mirror. This same principle {{could be applied to}} link two TouchLights together allowing two people anywhere in the world {{to communicate with each other}} as if they were sitting on opposite <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same <b>desk.</b> It can capture a high definition image of anything placed up against the screen. This image is then displayed in 2D. <b>The</b> user <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TouchLight can manipulate the size, position and orientation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image by performing the corresponding action with his or her hands. The screen has a microphone built in that can detect vibration, thus allowing the user to change setting simply by tapping the screen.|$|R
50|$|The model 102 {{telephone}} consisted <b>of</b> <b>the</b> handset mounting typically {{placed on}} <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> {{top and a}} physically separate desk set box or subscriber set. This box was typically {{mounted on a wall}} near the phone or on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a <b>desk.</b> <b>The</b> <b>desk</b> set contained only the dial, a handset cradle with hook switch, and the handset positioned in the cradle, while the subscriber set contained the ringer and the electrical components to interface the unit with the telephone network.|$|R
