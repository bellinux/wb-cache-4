5000|$|Drop <b>shotting</b> {{is a high}} finesse {{technique}} for fishing plastic baits like Senko's, and consist of a small thin-wire hook with a weight attached to the tag {{end of the line}} about 12-18". This is in contrast to the more traditional Texas Rig, where the weight slides inline, resting on the nose of the bait, or the Carolina Rig, where the weight is fixed above the bait. The drop shot rig provides the ability to slack the line and twitch the rod, giving it an enticing wiggle on the way down. This simple, but versatile technique has endless combinations with the different hooks, soft plastics and weights that can be used.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{ascertain}} the behaviour of Net fishing gear submerged in the water as well as that of the fish schools against the gear, by means of diving and camera snap <b>shotting.</b> Basing on the 12 times repeated experiments on board the training ship of our Faculty, named NANSEI MARU (83 ton, 400 P. S) the present study was carried out in October, 1984 and in May, 1985 at the sea-front which is 38 ~ 62 m deep and situated on the ocean lying west of Tane island. The behaviours of Net fishing gear under the trawling condition and those of the fish schools on the point of entering the gear were snapped by the low illumination diving television cameras attatched both at the otter board and at the Net mouth. The results obtained were as follow : (1) The figure of the otter board at the commencement of the towing, showed a slight slanting one, turned a little inwardly at the horizontal view and ackwardly at the vertical view, being influenced by the drawing force coming from the upward and insidely directed workings of the towing line; the Net trawling velocity being 2 knots, without any amount of wavering motion, being stable as thoroughly as possible. Net mouth was kept open regularly, wavering was reduced to almost zero. The hanging chains attatched the fishing line became detatched 5 ~ 10 cm from the sea bottom, showing the figure expected to appear on the design. A big amount of smoking mud was brought up out of the hanging chains, the iron balls attatched both at the fishing line and otter board, which prevented the fish schools from escaping out of the net-mouth, thus promoting the catching effect of the trawl net. (2) In the experiments carried out in May of 1985, the number of the fish observed was nine near the otter board, and fifty in the vicinity of the net mouth, respectively. Almost all the fish kept themselves swimming 30 ~ 50 cm in front of the fishing line of the net mouth, showing the same direction as that of the Net, for a long time. Of these fish, such big sized ones with fork length about 70 cm as Thick lip bream Plectorhynchus pictus and Rock bream Oplegnathus fasciatus made tumbling motions just above the fishing line of the net mouth, and then transferred themselves into the Net while the small sized fish were threatened by the tail movements of the big sized ones to be induced into the interior of the Net. 1984 年 10 月と 1985 年 5 月,種子島西方海域の水深 38 ~ 62 mの海域において,本学練習船南星丸(83 トン, 400 P. S) により計 12 回の曳網実験を行った。実験方法は低照度用水中テレビカメラをオッターボード及び網口付近に装着し,曳網中における漁具の動態と魚群行動を撮影した。その結果は次の通りである。(1) オッターボードの姿勢は,曳網速力 2 ノットで内方と後方に傾斜し,動揺も少なく最も安定した状態となる。網口は正常に拡網しほとんど動揺しない。沈子綱に装着した垂下用チェーンは約 10 cm離底し,設計通りの値を示した。オッターボード,鉄球及び垂下用チェーンからは大量の砂煙が発生し,魚群の網口からの逸出を防止し,その入網効果を発揮している。(2) 1985 年 5 月の実験において観察出来た魚群は,オッターボード付近で 9 尾,網口付近で約 50 尾であった。ほとんどの魚群は網口の沈子綱の前方 30 ~ 50 cm付近において網と同方向に長時間に亘って遊泳する。このうち体長 70 cmのコロダイとイシダイは網口の沈子綱の直上において反転入網する。また小型魚は前方を泳ぐ中型魚の尾部の動きに威嚇され入網した...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} PhD Thesis was {{to study}} the species {{spectrum}} of the chrysomelid genus Oulema in Brno environment. On observed fields the following species of the genus Oulema were found: O. melanopus, O. rufocyanea and O. gallaeciana. O. rufocyanea was recorded from in field conditions in the Czech Republic for the first time. The most numerous was O. gallaeciana, followed by O. melanopus and O. rufocyanea. The sex ratio was in favour of males, only in one case the sex ratio was equal. The beginning of insect invasion into the growths of winter wheat corresponded to TS 6 = 110 oC. The maximum occurence of Oulema-species was included in TS 6 = 149 - 250 oC. This results show that in optimal weather conditions the maximal abundance can occur earlier than is cited in the literature (TS 6 = 200 - 250 oC). On the contrary, the limit TS 6 = 400 oC for monitoring of larvae was verified. The occurence of each species of the genus Oulema was evaluated by means of analysis of variance, while the Tukey {{test was used to}} asses group homogenity. The statistically significant difference (p < 0, 01) were proved for feeding plant, species of leaf beetles and the date of sweeping and next for all interactions. Only the interaction of species of leaf beetle x the date of sweeping, was found significantly different (p < 0, 05). During the three years period the females of O. melanopus with mature eggs were observed in winter wheat for 16 to 48 days, the females of O. gallaeciana for 40 to 52 days and the females of O. rufocyanea for 14 - 23 days. The same characteristics were observed in the growths of spring barley - the females of O. melanopus for 21 to 37 days, the females of O. gallaeciana for 30 to 47 days and the females of O. rufocyanea for 1 - 25 days. In the first sampling event which corresponded with the first infestation of Oulema species in winter wheat, the females with mature eggs were not found. On the other hand, in growths of spring barley, where the sampling started at the beginning of <b>shotting</b> stage, the females were in the third and the fourth stages of oogenesis. Distinguishing O. melanopus and O. rufocyanea according to external morphological characteristics is considered as uncertain. Totally 469 specimens of O. melanopus and 114 specimens of O. rufocyanea were measured. The ratio of some characteristics was studied: ratio of body length to elytra length, ratio of body length to pronotum length, ratio of elytra length to elytra width, ratio of body length to length of antennae, ratio of pronotum length to pronotum width and ratio of the second to the third antennomeres. Only the ratio of body length to length of antennae and the ratio of the second to the third antennomeres were found to be statistically significantly differenct for both sexes. To separate these two species, the shape of male and female genitalia showed to be the most reliable identification characteristicAvailable from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|E
