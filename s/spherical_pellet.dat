40|$|A common way to {{formulate}} controlled-release (CR) pharmaceuticals is to coat pellets of active substance with a polymer film, decrease {{the size of}} the pellets and distribute them as multiple-unit dosages in capsules. To increase the understanding of the release mechanism, the pellet shape and surface structure of pellets, before and after release in microtitre plates, have been studied by scanning electron microscope and X-ray energy-dispersive spectrometry. By performing these studies we associate release profiles during the first few hours to the microscopic structure. Pellets were divided into three classes (<b>spherical</b> <b>pellets,</b> dumbbell shaped pellets and twin-pellets) according to pellet form. Cases of burst release occurred for all three shape classes due to "open-window-defects" at the surface. Areas of thinner polymer film in the neck-region of dumbbell shaped pellets broaden the range of intermediate release rates for this pellet shape. The surface of twin pellets and dumbbell shaped pellets showed more defects, which increases the release rates in comparison to <b>spherical</b> <b>pellets.</b> All pellets with high release rates revealed ruptures in the polymer film, whereas only small cracks could be traced for pellets with slow release rates.

40|$|An inhaler adapter {{has been}} {{designed}} for the characterization of the aerosol clouds from medical aerosol generators such as nebulizers, dry powder inhalers (dpis) and metered dose inhalers (mdis) with laser diffraction technology. The adapter has a pre-separator, for separation of large particles (i. e. carrier crystals) from the aerosol cloud before it is exposed to the laser beam. It also has a fine particle collector for measuring the emitted mass fraction of fines by chemical detection methods after laser diffraction sizing. The closed system enables flow control through the aerosol generators and all test conditions, including ambient temperature and relative humidity, are automatically recorded. Counter flows minimize particle deposition onto the two windows for the laser beam, which make successive measurements without cleaning of these windows possible. The adapter has successfully been tested for nebulizers, mdis and dpis. In a comparative study with ten nebulizers {{it was found that}} these devices, differ considerably in droplet size (distribution) of the aerosol cloud for the same 10 % aqueous tobramycin solution (volume median diameters ranging from 1. 25 to 3. 25 mum) when they are used under the conditions recommended by the manufacturers. The droplet size distribution generated by the Sidestream (with PortaNeb compressor) is very constant during nebulization until dry running of the device. Comparative testing of dpis containing <b>spherical</b> <b>pellet</b> type of formulations for the drug (e. g. the AstraZeneca Turbuhaler) with the adapter is fast and simple. But also formulations containing larger carrier material could successfully be measured. Disintegration efficiency of a test inhaler with carrier retainment (acting as a pre-separator) could be measured quite accurately both for a colistin sulfate formulation with 16. 7 % of a lactose fraction 106 - 150 mum and for a budesonide formulation with a carrier mixture of Pharmatose 325 and 150 M. Therefore, it is concluded that, with this special adapter, laser diffraction may be a valuable tool for comparative inhaler evaluation, device development, powder formulation and quality control. Compared to cascade impactor analysis, laser diffraction is much faster. In addition to that, more detailed and also different information about the aerosol cloud is obtained.

40|$|The {{continuous}} {{increase in}} the global demand for a cleaner energy source has instigated much interest in converting natural gas to ultra-clean fuels and value-added chemicals. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) is a key technology for converting syngas, produced from coal, biomass or natural gas, {{into a variety of}} hydrocarbon products. Although this technology has been around for decades, commercial development remains relatively slow and limited to use of few reactor configurations (e. g. fixed-bed reactor and slurry-bubble column reactor). On the lab-scale, supercritical solvents were utilized in FTS as a reaction media since they have the advantages of both the gas-phase reaction (fixed-bed reactor) and the liquid-phase reaction (slurry-bubble column reactor), while simultaneously overcoming their limitations. This work focuses on modeling the behavior in the reactor bed (?macro-scale? assessment) and then zooming into the catalyst pellet itself (?micro-scale? assessment). The aim of this research is to simulate the heat and mass transfer behavior inside the reactor bed, identify typical conditions that look at the existence and absence of both mass and heat transfer limitations, and to quantify the role of the main controlling parameters on the overall behavior of the reactor bed and on the catalyst effectiveness factor. An often used mathematical model of the fixed-bed reactor was applied to simulate the concentration and temperature profile simultaneously based on the appropriate mass and heat balances at both scales. A second-order ordinary differential equation was used for a <b>spherical</b> <b>pellet</b> in the radial coordinate for both mass and heat balances, while a one-dimensional steady state pseudo heterogeneous model was used for the reactor bed modeling in the axial direction. In addition, in both models the mass balance equation was expressed in terms of fugacity to account for the non-ideal behavior of the reaction mixture in the SCF-FTS. The thermodynamic properties of the mixture were estimated using the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state (SRK-EOS). The simulation results of this study showed a high temperature rise in the gas- phase FTS relative to that in the SCF-FTS under a comparable reaction conditions.

40|$|Iron ore pellets are {{a highly}} refined product {{supplied}} to the steel making industry {{for use in}} blast furnaces or direct reduction processes. The use of pellets offers many advantages such as customer adopted products, transportability and mechanical strength yet the production is time and energy consuming. Being such, {{there is a natural}} driving force to enhance the pelletization in order to optimize production and improve quality. The aim with this thesis is to develop numerical models with which the drying zone of an induration furnace can be examined and optimized. To start with, a continuous model of velocity and temperature distribution in the up-draught drying zone, without regard to moisture transport, is developed with aid of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The results show a rapid cooling of air due to the high specific surface area in the porous material. With the global model an overall understanding of heat transfer is gained, but the heat and moisture transport should also be investigated on a smaller scale in order to account for small scale phenomena such as turbulence and dispersion. Drying of a bed of iron ore pellets is therefore considered by modeling a two-dimensional discrete system of round pellets. The system is divided by modified Voronoi diagrams and the convective heat transfer of hot fluid flow through the system including dispersion due to random configuration of the pellets is modeled. The results show that the temperature front advances much faster in the gaps between pellets than in the interior of the pellets even if all the heat energy of the air goes in heating of the pellets initially. Decrease of temperature is possible for low dew points of the input air due to evaporation. If the dew point temperature is higher than the temperature of the pellets on the other hand, there is slight condensation of the steam {{at the beginning of the}} process and the temperature increases faster than it would for pure thermal heating. An uneven distribution in temperature and moisture content between pellets is furthermore displayed in the discrete system. This phenomenon is related to the natural dispersion occurring in random system of pellets. To further investigate drying of individual pellets, forced convective heating of a cylindrical porous pellet with surrounding flow field taken into account is first examined. A model with properties similar to that of an iron ore pellet is numerically investigated and with interface heat transfer condition provided by CFD, the simulations show an increased heating rate for the porous cylinder when compared to a solid. The most plausible explanation to this is that there is less solid to heat up for the porous medium since the porous cylinder behaves as if it was impermeable from a fluid flow point of view. With diffusive liquid transport inside the two-dimensional pellet and corresponding evaporation at the surface, simulations of drying show an initial warm up phase with a succeeding constant rate drying phase. Constant drying rate will only be achieved if the surface temperature is constant, i. e. if it has reached the wet bulb temperature. The falling rate period will subsequently start at the forward stagnation point when the local moisture content approaches zero, while other parts of the surface still provide enough moisture to allow surface evaporation. The phases will thus coexist for a period of time. Experiments are carried out in order to examine the drying behavior of a single iron ore pellet with main goal to retrieve data for validation of the computational drying models. The experiments are performed with two inlet temperatures and one pellet from the experiments is scanned by an optical scanning equipment. In order to investigate the influence of surface irregularities and overall geometry on drying, simulations of the first drying period are compared for: 1) a scanned pellet 2) an oval pellet resembling the experimental one with equivalent volume 3) a <b>spherical</b> <b>pellet</b> with equivalent volume. The results show that the local moisture content at the surface is influenced by both surface irregularities and overall geometry. A smooth surface will decrease the local variation of moisture while a spherical geometry will, compared to an oval, increase the difference. A diffusive model taking into account capillary flow of liquid moisture and internal evaporation is developed to account for the whole drying process and simulations of the scanned pellet are validated with good agreement. The result clearly shows four stages of drying; i) evaporation of liquid moisture at the pellet surface, ii) surface evaporation coexisting with internal drying as the surface is locally dry, iii) internal evaporation with completely dry surface and iv) internal evaporation at boiling temperatures. A moisture front moving towards the core of the pellet will start to develop at the second drying stage and the results show that the front will have a non-symmetrical form arising from the surrounding fluid flow. With the developed drying model, simulations are then carried out on a <b>spherical</b> <b>pellet</b> with aim to investigate how the inlet air humidity affects drying. The results indicates that the effect of air dew point arise from the start of the first drying period, i. e the surface evaporation period, while the difference is reduced at the end of the period due to a prolonged stage of constant rate drying attained at high dew points. The wet-bulb temperature is increased with humidity and condensation will occur if the pellet surface temperature is below the dew point. Furthermore it is found that the moisture gradients at the surface and inside the pellet are increased with drying rate.

The goals for the quarter include: (1) Conduct experiments using a trickle bed reactor to determine the effect of reactor type on the product distribution. (2) Use <b>spherical</b> <b>pellets</b> of silica as a support for zirconia for the purpose of increasing surface, area and performance of the catalysts. (3) Conduct exploratory experiments to determine the effect of super critical drying of the catalyst on the catalyst surface area and performance. (4) Prepare a ceria/zirconia catalyst by the precipitation method...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims to {{find out}} the {{effective}} diffusivity (Deff) of a porous material – γ-alumina, using an unsteady state method with two inert gases at ambient condition with no reactions. For porous materials, Deff is important because it determines the amount of reactants that transfers to the surface of pores. When Deff is known, the apparent tortuosity factor of γ-alumina is calculated using the parallel pore model. The apparent tortuosity factor is important because: (a) {{it can be used to}} back-calculate Deff at reacting conditions; (b) once Deff with reactions is known, the Thiele modulus can be calculated and hence the global reaction rate can be found; (c) apparent tortuosity factor is also important for modelling purposes (e. g. modelling a packed-bed column or a catalytic combustion reactor packed with porous γ-alumina in various shapes and monoliths). Experimental measurements were performed to determine the effective diffusivity of a binary pair of non-reacting gases (He in N 2, and N 2 in He) in <b>spherical</b> γ-alumina <b>pellets</b> (1 mm diameter), and in γ-alumina washcoated monoliths (washcoat thickness 20 to 60 µm, on 400 cpsi (cells per square inch) cordierite support). The method used is based on the chromatographic technique, where a gas flows through a tube, which is packed with the sample to be tested. A pulse of tracer gas is injected (e. g. using sample loops: 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 5 ml) and by using an on-line mass spectrometer the response in the outlet of the packed bed is monitored over time. For the <b>spherical</b> <b>pellets,</b> the tube i. d. = 13. 8 mm and the packed bed depths were 200 and 400 mm. For monoliths the tube i. d. = 7 mm and the packed lengths were 500 and 1000 mm. When the chromatographic technique was applied to the monoliths, it was observed that experimental errors can be significant, and it is very difficult to interpret the data. However, the technique worked well with the <b>spherical</b> <b>pellets,</b> and the effective diffusivity of He in N 2 was 0. 75 – 1. 38 × 10 - 7 m 2 s- 1, and for N 2 in He was 1. 81 – 3. 10 × 10 - 7 m 2 s- 1. Using the parallel pore model to back-calculate the apparent tortuosity factor, then a value between 5 to 9. 5 was found for the pellets...|$|R
