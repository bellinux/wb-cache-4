5|$|On 28 January 2014, the DA {{announced}} that Mamphela Ramphele had accepted {{an invitation to}} <b>stand</b> <b>as</b> its presidential candidate in the 2014 general election, and the DA and Agang South Africa were set to merge. On the 31st, Ramphele stated {{that she would not}} take up DA party membership and would remain the leader of Agang South Africa, resulting in confusion. On 2 February, Helen Zille stated that Ramphele had reneged on her agreement to <b>stand</b> <b>as</b> the DA's presidential candidate. Ramphele subsequently apologised for the reversal of her decision, saying that the timing was not right as the reaction to it had shown people were unable to overcome race-based party politics.|$|E

5|$|As a {{prominent}} {{member of his}} local community, Bruxner became involved in emerging movements to have a political force for regional areas and joined and was convinced by friends to <b>stand</b> <b>as</b> a Progressive Party candidate in the 1920 New South Wales state election. Bruxner was elected under proportional representation with 23% as the second member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly district of Northern Tablelands alongside his friend David Drummond.|$|E
5|$|As {{there is}} no {{definitive}} date of when Dyer turned professional and many fights in the early 20th century were poorly recorded, the boxing record associated with Dyer is incomplete. His total bouts and results presently <b>stand,</b> <b>as</b> listed by Boxrec, as 72 fights, of which 44 were wins (14 by knockout), 20 loses (4 by knockout), 6 draws and 2 'no contests'. It is accepted that this list is incomplete and more bouts could be added in future, or changed.|$|E
5|$|By 1996, various {{prominent}} {{public figures}} were arguing {{for the implementation}} of directly-elected mayors for large UK cities like London. The idea of a London mayor of a Greater London Authority had been included in Labour's 1997 election manifesto, and after their election a referendum was scheduled for May 1998, in which there was a 72% yes vote with a 34% turnout. With the first mayoral election scheduled for May 2000, in March 1998 Livingstone stated his intention to <b>stand</b> <b>as</b> a potential Labour candidate for the position.|$|E

5|$|During {{its first}} day of wide release, Wolverine took in an {{estimated}} $35million, with almost $5million of that from midnight showings. The earnings placed the film as the 16th highest-grossing opening day ever (22nd with ticket-price inflation). It went on to be number one film {{at the box office}} with a total of $85million. Among summer kick-offs, it ranked fifth behind Spider-Man, X2, Spider-Man 3, and Iron Man and it was in the top ten of comic book adaptations. The opening was lower than the last film in the franchise, X-Men: The Last <b>Stand,</b> <b>as</b> well as X2, but higher than X-Men, the first film in the series.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{formation}} of the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government on 11 May 2010, Gordon Brown resigned as Prime Minister and Leader of the Labour Party with immediate effect. Deputy Leader Harriet Harman took over as Acting Leader and became Leader of the Opposition. On 14 May, Miliband announced that he would <b>stand</b> <b>as</b> a candidate in the forthcoming leadership election. He launched his campaign during a speech given at a Fabian Society conference and was nominated by 62 fellow Labour MPs. The other candidates were left-wing backbencher Diane Abbott, Shadow Education Secretary Ed Balls, Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham and Miliband's elder brother, Shadow Foreign Secretary David Miliband.|$|E
5|$|Harding, as a {{politician}} respected by both Republicans and Progressives, was asked to be temporary chairman of the 1916 Republican National Convention and to deliver the keynote address. He urged delegates to <b>stand</b> <b>as</b> a united party. The convention nominated Justice Charles Evans Hughes. Harding reached out to Roosevelt once the former president declined the 1916 Progressive nomination, a refusal that effectively scuttled that party. In the November 1916 presidential election, despite increasing Republican unity, Hughes was narrowly defeated by Wilson.|$|E
50|$|Gibson <b>stood</b> <b>as</b> SNP {{candidate}} for the Inverness seat in the United Kingdom general election, February 1974. He <b>stood</b> <b>as</b> a {{candidate for}} Ross, Cromarty and Skye in 1987 and again in 1992.|$|R

5|$|Hesketh was {{appointed}} High Sheriff of Lancashire in 1830. In 1831 {{he was invited}} to <b>stand</b> <b>as</b> a Tory Party candidate for the constituency of Preston. He had similar views to Tory statesman Robert Peel and readily agreed to stand. Hesketh-Fleetwood opposed monopolies, slavery and capital punishment and was in favour of reforming the Corn Laws. At the 1832 general election, he was elected—along with his friend, Henry Stanley—Member of Parliament for Preston, in the first parliament following the Reform Act. He made his maiden speech to parliament in 1834.|$|E
5|$|Martin McGuinness of Sinn Féin and Ian Pearson of the Northern Ireland Office {{were at the}} match, as {{were eight}} family members of victims of the Omagh bombing, who sat in the Hogan <b>Stand</b> <b>as</b> guests of the GAA. Donegal singer Mickey Joe Harte sang Ireland's {{national}} anthem, Amhrán na bhFiann, before the match. In the All-Ireland Minor Football Championship Final, held just before the senior game, Laois and Dublin drew, each side scoring 111 (14 points).|$|E
5|$|One of Gheorghe Tătărescu's last {{appearances}} in public was his <b>stand</b> <b>as</b> {{one of the}} prosecution's witnesses in the 1954 trial of Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu, when he claimed that the defendant had been infiltrated into the PCR during {{the time when he}} had been premier (Pătrășcanu was posthumously cleared of all charges). Released in 1955, Tătărescu died in Bucharest, less than two years later. According to Sanda Tătărescu Negropontes, this came as a result of tuberculosis contracted while in detention.|$|E
5000|$|Duray's {{starts from}} 1925 thru 1929 <b>stood</b> <b>as</b> the best five race {{starting}} streak from 1929 until 1990, when his record was bested by Rick Mears. His streak currently <b>stands</b> <b>as</b> 3rd best in [...] "500" [...] history.|$|R
50|$|At the 1935 General Election, {{just one}} {{candidate}} <b>stood</b> <b>as</b> an Independent Progressive, {{and that was}} Gerald Bailey at Aldershot. Bailey, a Quaker, had <b>stood</b> <b>as</b> a Liberal in 1929 and since 1930 had run the National Peace Council.|$|R
50|$|Del Prado Chávez <b>stood</b> <b>as</b> a {{candidate}} in several elections. In 1962 he <b>stood</b> <b>as</b> a National Liberation Front (FLN) candidate.

In 1985 he <b>stood</b> <b>as</b> a United Left candidate, obtaining 183,022 votes. In 1990 he again contested on behalf of IU.|$|R
5|$|Products of volcano-ice {{interactions}} <b>stand</b> <b>as</b> various structures, whose {{shape is}} dependent on complex eruptive and environmental interactions. Glacial volcanism is a good indicator of past ice distribution, making it an important climatic marker. Since they are imbedded in ice, as ice retracts worldwide there are concerns that tuyas and other structures may destabalize, resulting in mass landslides. Evidence of volcanic-glacial interactions are evident in Iceland and parts of British Columbia, and it is even possible that they {{play a role in}} deglaciation.|$|E
5|$|The Second and Third of May 1808 {{are thought}} to have been {{intended}} as parts of a larger series. Written commentary and circumstantial evidence suggest that Goya painted four large canvases memorializing the rebellion of May 1808. In his memoirs of the Royal Academy in 1867, José Caveda wrote of four paintings by Goya of the second of May, and Cristóbal Ferriz—an artist and a collector of Goya—mentioned two other paintings on the theme: a revolt at the royal palace and a defense of artillery barracks. Contemporary prints <b>stand</b> <b>as</b> precedents for such a series. The disappearance of two paintings may indicate official displeasure with the depiction of popular insurrection.|$|E
5|$|The five Gefion {{passages}} seem {{to highlight}} the championing of a new order antagonistic to goddess worship. In light of {{what appears to be}} an elaborate thematic statement about patrilineage in the poem, the new order may also have entailed a change in kinship systems. Grendel and his mother may <b>stand</b> <b>as</b> types of earlier, matrilineal tribes. Further the hall which is the object of struggle between Beowulf and the first two monsters may symbolize the consolidation of new hierarchical social organization among the northern Germanic peoples.|$|E
50|$|In the 2006 London {{borough council}} elections, Malvin Brown <b>stood</b> <b>as</b> a {{candidate}} in the South Hornchurch ward and received 186 votes. He also <b>stood</b> <b>as</b> a candidate at a by-election in that ward on 3 July 2008 and received 17 votes.|$|R

She also stood four times for parliament; for Wokingham in 1964 and 1966, at the Walthamstow West by-election, 1967 and for Chippenham in 1970.|$|R
5|$|The strict {{requirements}} {{have been}} justified {{on the basis}} that the President should be a person of integrity and moral standing, with the ability to monitor the financial affairs {{of the state and the}} management of the public service sector. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has argued that this stringent screening process is necessary as the President does not <b>stand</b> <b>as</b> a political party nominee. He is thus not subjected to the internal screening mechanism of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP).|$|E
5|$|This {{first became}} {{evident in the}} great {{campaign}} to re-elect Gladstone. Known today as the Midlothian campaign, it was masterminded by the Roseberys. Rosebery used his influence to have Gladstone invited to <b>stand</b> <b>as</b> parliamentary candidate for Midlothian, near to Rosebery's Dalmeny estate. Gladstone had nominally retired from politics after losing his Greenwich seat in 1874, when Disraeli had been swept to power. The campaign was based at Dalmeny where Lady Rosebery hosted a series of large political house parties throughout the long campaign. The Tories were later to claim that Rosebery had paid for Gladstone's campaign. Rosebery later admitted to spending £50,000.|$|E
5|$|This formula was {{powerful}} enough to <b>stand</b> <b>as</b> the basis for all subsequent descriptions of motion within the solar system until the 20th century. During that time, sophisticated methods of perturbation analysis were invented to calculate the deviations of orbits due {{to the influence of}} multiple bodies on a planet, moon, comet, or asteroid. The formalism was exact enough to allow mathematicians to predict the existence of the planet Neptune before it was observed.|$|E
50|$|Cook {{held the}} UK National records for 100m, 200m and 400m for over 25 years. Her 100m best of 11.10 secs, <b>stood</b> <b>as</b> the UK record from 1981-2008. Her 200m best of 22.10 secs, <b>stood</b> <b>as</b> the UK record from 1984-2015. She had first broken the 200m record in 1979. Her 400m best of 49.43, <b>stood</b> <b>as</b> the UK record from 1984-2013. She had first broken the 400m record in 1982. In the sprint relay, along with Heather Hunte, Bev Goddard and Sonia Lannaman, {{she set the}} UK record with 42.43 at the 1980 Moscow Olympics, which <b>stood</b> <b>as</b> the UK record until 2014. She is also a former holder of the World Best for 300m, running 35.46 in 1984.|$|R
50|$|Mohamed Ali <b>stood</b> <b>as</b> the Communist Party {{candidate}} in Mutur at the 1947 parliamentary election but {{was defeated by}} the United National Party candidate A. R. A. M.
