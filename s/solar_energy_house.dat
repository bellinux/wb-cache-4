40|$|Solar Decathlon Europe is an {{international}} competition among universities which promotes interdisciplinary learning in engineering and architecture. Students from different disciplines participate in teams guided by several professors during a 29 month preparation period plus five weeks of on-site contest. The educational project involves designing, building and testing a <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> <b>house</b> connected to the electrical grid with the strategy of maximizing self-consumption, supported by bioclimatic technologies and maintaining a low environmental footprint. It culminates in a on-site contest in which teams must assembly the house themselves, test it with ordinary real life tasks and finally disassembly it. The event has also a divulgative aim, trying to make students and visitors get interested in discovering the problems presented by real engineering and architecture applications. In addition, SDE covers R&D aspects in {{different fields such as}} energy efficiency, solar energy and bioclimatic architecture. This article presents the methodology followed during the SDE 2012 edition, in which more than 850 students participated. The obtained results show that the educational competition was a success according to the technical and professional ambitions of the students, most of them considering that their knowledge had increased in areas related to technical and multidisciplinary aspects...|$|E

Fossil fuels that providing three quarters of world's basic energy needs cause global warming with greenhouse gases becomes progressively smaller as well. Energy consumption is constantly increasing in parallel with population growth in the world, urbanization, industrialization and expansion of technology. While fossil fuels are quickly running out, energy demand is increasing rapidly. It is assumed that Petroleum is getting run out 2050 years. Natural gas and coal will have reserve until 2050 and 2150. In addition, the uses of fossil fuels have many negative effects to our environment. Cities are covered with black exhalations and sometimes it is hard to breathe because of air pollution. The Ozone layer has pierced and has became unable to fulfill the task of filtering.

The use of solar thermal in connection with district heating is far behind (relatively only one tenth of) the use of solar thermal in individual houses - even though it is in most cases much cheaper to supply <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> centrally to a district heating network, than to supply <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> to individual <b>houses.</b> In Denmark right now “an explosion” in numbers of large scale solar district heating systems is seen.

40|$|Receiving some of {{the highest}} levels of solar {{irradiance}} in the world, Australia is an ideal location for widespread implementation of <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> technologies and smart buildings, designed {{to take advantage of the}} excellent solar resource. This thesis explores the concept of achieving a zero energy residential dwelling in the Sydney climate through energy efficient and passive solar design coupled with a photovoltaic/thermal (PVT) system. A simple house was modelled to determine the optimal values of the key design variables that would result in a low space energy consumption and low life cycle cost. The optimised low <b>energy</b> <b>house</b> resulted in an annual space energy consumption of 252 kWh, representing a 94 % reduction compared with the NSW BASIX standard and requiring only minimal heating and cooling. Results for the best performing low <b>energy</b> <b>house</b> models are shown to have a lower life cycle cost compared with a conventional brick veneer house model designed to meet the NSW BASIX building requirements. A PVT air system was investigated as an option for transforming the low <b>energy</b> <b>house</b> into a zero <b>energy</b> <b>house</b> with an emphasis on the winter performance. A holistic system design approach was used to design an experimental PVT air system that would maximise the thermal and electrical energy outputs and minimise the required fan energy. Simple and detailed theoretical models were presented as a physically meaningful representation of the PVT collector and provide a good match with experimental results. The optimum air flow rate range was determined to be 0. 04 - 0. 06 kg/s. m 2 which produced a temperature rise of 5 - 8 °C at midday for a typical sunny winter's day in Sydney. A unique result was achieved whereby the additional PV energy generated due to ventilation is in excess of the fan energy requirement. This was made possible through energy efficient hydraulic design using large ducts to minimise the pressure loss and selection of a fan that would produce high air flow rates at a low input power. The PVT system also demonstrated good potential for night purge ventilation cooling in summer. An affordable zero <b>energy</b> <b>house</b> in Sydney is therefore a very achievable goal with currently available building materials, energy efficiency measures and <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> technologies...|$|R
