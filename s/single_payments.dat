In line with the Commission proposals within the Multi-Annual Financial Framework, the national envelopes for direct payments will be adjusted so that those that receive less than 90% of the EU average payment per hectare will receive more. The gap between the amounts currently foreseen and 90% of the EU-27 average is reduced by one-third.|$|E

5000|$|A Green Paper {{published}} in June 1985 [...] proposed a new Social Fund {{to be administered}} by the Department for Health and Social Services (DHSS) on a discretionary basis to give more flexible help to those in need. The new policy was also prompted {{by the fact that}} in recent years there had been spiralling expenditure incurred by claims for <b>single</b> <b>payments.</b> The original policy in the Green Paper was to provide a budget-limited Fund to help in four areas of need: community care needs; budgeting expenses; maternity and funeral expenses; and expenses arising from financial crises. A White Paper followed in December 1985. The White Paper proposed a set Social Fund grant to meet maternity needs (replacing the pre-existing £25 maternity grant along with <b>single</b> <b>payments</b> provision for maternity needs). Similarly, there would be a set Social Fund grant to meet funeral needs (replacing the £30 death grant, and these payments would be contingent on three new 'income-related' benefits, i.e. Income Support, Family Credit or Housing Benefit. Social Fund grants for maternity and funeral needs would be based on clear, objective, criteria and payments would not be constrained by the budget; they would be paid automatically on satisfying the qualifying conditions. In addition, it proposed Social Fund loans to meet 'intermittent expenses'. These would be determined on a discretionary basis of what was reasonable in all the circumstances and the likelihood of recovery of the loan. It also proposed a loans scheme to cover financial crises, for example, where money/benefits had been lost or stolen, or where there was an urgent need for funds following flood or fire. As regards this form of loan the White Paper confirmed these would not be restricted to those receiving Income Support.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{a simple}} {{graphical}} model we analyze {{the effects of the}} single payment scheme (SPS), introduced in the EU in 2003 on land prices and the distribution of rents. In par-ticular, we are interested in if the <b>single</b> <b>payments</b> are capitalized into agricultural land values. All three different ways to implement the SPS are discussed: the historical model, the regional model and the hybrid model. We show that the outcome crucially depends on the proportion of eligible agricultural area to entitlements and which model is in place.

30|$|The second {{category}} contains policy variables, belonging to both CAP pillar I and II.

The first pillar policy can negatively affect the HNV farmland score due to maintenance support and the introduction of commodity crops.
