A <b>surface</b> <b>diagram</b> is a cube {{equipped with a}} stratification of regions, walls, seams, and nodes. We label the strata with morphisms in a strict 3 -category C by codimension. Away from nodes, horizontal slice stratified squares are string diagrams representing compositions of 2 -morphisms. In particular, a <b>surface</b> <b>diagram</b> has source and target string diagrams on its bottom and top faces, respectively. We may evaluate a <b>surface</b> <b>diagram</b> to give a 3 -morphism in C. The domain and codomain are given by {{the evaluation of the}} source and target string diagrams.

In Sd(G), diagrams are taken up to an isotopy-like relation called evolution. This relation destroys the braiding that we expect to have in a tricategory. We wish to capture braiding without working in the fully weak setting of a tricategory. We instead choose to work with in the semi-strict setting of Gray- categories. We define Gray surface diagrams to be those with certain good projection properties.

This can reduce the redundancy of the models and therefore it decreases the number of model dimensions. Such models can be optimized with stochastic methods. Evolutionary and genetic algorithms are suitable to handle high dimensional problems. Because of their good convergence and minimal requirements to the fitnes function they are interesting for an application to the inversion. The investigations verify of our expectations. Stochastic methods of optimization seem to be applicable for the inversion of seismic data. (orig.)

40|$|Several new {{combinatorial}} {{descriptions of}} closed 4 -manifolds {{have recently been}} introduced {{in the study of}} smooth maps from 4 -manifolds to surfaces. These descriptions consist of simple closed curves in a closed, orientable surface and these curves appear as so called vanishing sets of corresponding maps. In the present paper we focus on homotopies canceling pairs of cusps so called cusp merges. We first discuss the classification problem of such homotopies, showing that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of homotopy classes of cusp merges canceling a given pair of cusps and the set of homotopy classes of suitably decorated curves between the cusps. Using our classification, we further give a complete description of the behavior of vanishing sets under cusp merges in terms of mapping class groups of surfaces.
