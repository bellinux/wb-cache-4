30|$|The {{problem is}} that the {{structure}} of 79 a leads to the interpretation that he became anxious. This interpretation results from the <b>systematic</b> default <b>interpretation</b> of a resultative de-part with an overt NP. This <b>systematic</b> default <b>interpretation,</b> in turn, results from one constructional constraint of the V-DE construction mentioned above, namely that, when the de-part is resultative and has an overt NP between -de and the predicate of the de-clause, the AP or VP of the de-part generally needs to be predicated of one of the overt NPs in the de-part.|$|R

In places, Boole talks of terms being interpreted by sets, but he also recognises terms that cannot always be so interpreted, such as the term 2AB, which arises in equational manipulations. Such terms he classes uninterpretable terms; although elsewhere he has some instances of such terms being interpreted by integers.|$|E

Boodin's work preserved the tradition of philosophical idealism within the framework of contemporary science. Boodin also focused on the social nature of human behavior believing an understanding required an appreciation of individual participation in social life and interpersonal relationship.|$|E

Ashlag’s system focused on the transformation of human consciousness from the [...] "desire to receive" [...] to the [...] "desire to give," [...] i.e., from egocentricity to altruism. This path of transformation is described in Lurianic Kabbalah.|$|E

For example, researchers perception, language, and founding assumptions also transfer systematically to managers through <b>systematic</b> <b>interpretation</b> biases (Starbuck and Mezias, 1996b). “Rationality that we apply to our theories is an ideal-type, distilled by thousands of years of analyses and debates among mathematicians, philosophers, and scientists. This idealized rationality leaves no room for maneuver; it reduces all conditions to binary states (…) it appeals to our esthetics, but violates our own rules, distorts our observations, and extrapolates our incomplete knowledge to ridiculous extremes” (1988b, p. 71).|$|E
5000|$|... ===Qualitative methods=== Feldman’s {{contributions}} to qualitative research stem from her experience doing empirical ethnographic research. She has developed ways of analyzing data that promote <b>systematic</b> <b>interpretation.</b> Her book, Strategies for Interpreting Qualitative Data (Sage, 1995) shows {{how to use}} theories of ethnomethodology, semiotics, dramaturgy and deconstruction as meta-theories to organize and examine rich ethnographic data. Later she (with co-authors Kaj Sköldberg, Ruth Nicole Brown, Debra Horner) developed a rhetorical approach to narrative analysis (Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, 2004) and (with co-author Brian Pentland) developed a narrative network approach to analyzing organizational routines (Organization Science, 2007).|$|E
50|$|Blake used symbols {{extensively}} in the illustrations; most notable {{is the use of}} right and left limbs in the figures. The right limb represents the spiritual and the good; the left, the material and evil. In plate six, Satan smites Job with boils using his left hand, and in plate 15 God indicates Behemoth and Leviathan with his left hand. Contrarily, God banishes Satan with his right hand in plate sixteen and speaks to Job from the whirlwind in plate fourteen with his right foot extended forward. Some scholars, however, have asserted that this <b>systematic</b> <b>interpretation</b> fails to account for inconsistencies in such symbolism and is excessively subjective.|$|E
40|$|The {{counterpart}} theorist has a problem: {{there is}} no obvious way to understand talk about actuality in terms of counterparts. Fara and Williamson have charged that this obstacle cannot be overcome. Here I defend the counterpart theorist by offering <b>systematic</b> <b>interpretations</b> of a quantified modal language that includes an actuality operator. Centrally, I disentangle the counterpart relation from a related notion, a 'representation relation'. The relation of possible things to the actual things they represent is variable, and an adequate account of modal language must {{keep track of the}} way it is systematically shifted by modal operators. I apply my account to resolve several puzzles about counterparts and actuality. In technical appendices, I prove some important logical results about this 'representational' counterpart system and its relationship to other modal systems. © 2013 Russell...|$|R
40|$|Using an ethnographic {{analysis}} of the social interfa-ces between state agents and Cape Verdean students in Portugal, observed through participant observa-tion in medical appointments, social work, immi-gration services and legal support to immigrants, this article aims to examine disciplinary state practices and the negotiations and power struggles that take place. The ethnographic cases discussed demonstrate how {{the idea of a}} fair and neutral state is simultaneously reproduced and denied in practice, thus elucidating the state as a symbol of union of an effective disunity. The ethnographic examples also indicate other dimensions of state practice, besides micro-disciplinary powers, which create room for flexibility and adaptation. And it is in this sense that ethnographies of interfaces between state and citizen offer a more relative pers-pective of excessively <b>systematic</b> <b>interpretations</b> of governmentality, illustrating how the effects of contradictory state practices are as unpredictable as human action itself...|$|R
5000|$|Many historians {{agree with}} this claim but think {{historical}} evidence should also include oral traditions as well as written history, a former criterion for a society having left [...] "prehistory". Critics of Trevor-Roper’s claim have questioned the validity of <b>systematic</b> <b>interpretations</b> of the African past, whether by materialist, Annalist or the traditional historical methods used by Trevor-Roper. Some say approaches which compare Africa with Europe or directly integrate it into European history cannot be accurate descriptions of African societies. Virtually all scholars now agree that Africa has a [...] "history" [...] {{and it is possible}} that Trevor-Roper's statements played an indirect and unintentional but important {{role in the development of}} post-colonial African studies, by motivating discussions about Africa’s role in the present and historical world. Despite controversies over historical accuracy in oral records, as in Alex Haley's [...] "Roots" [...] book and popular TV mini-series, African griots, or oral memoirists, provided a historical oral record.|$|R
50|$|Stewart's first book, {{entitled}} The Unity of Hegel’s Phenomenology of Spirit: A <b>Systematic</b> <b>Interpretation</b> (Evanston, Illinois: Northwestern University Press) {{appeared in}} 2000. The {{subject of the}} book is a traditional problem in Hegel studies, concerning the unity of Hegel's book The Phenomenology of Spirit. The long-term trend in Hegel studies has been to regard Hegel’s remarks about the systematic nature of his philosophy as simply indefensible. In contrast to this Stewart argues that this view tends to obscure a good deal with respect to different analyses of Hegel's work and thought, since it takes them out of their larger context from which they ultimately derive their meaning and in which they were intended to be understood. In this way Stewart aims to understand the Phenomenology {{as a part of a}} larger philosophical system and as a coherent and unified philosophical work in its own right.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was one of}} {{the early}} cases in which the Court {{had to deal with the}} {{question}} of the legal nature of the Constitution. By making the remark in the manner of obiter dictum concerning the Annex IV (the Constitution) and the rest of the peace agreement, the Court actually [...] "established the ground for legal unity" [...] of the entire peace agreement, which further implied that all of the annexes are in the hierarchical equality. In later decisions the Court confirmed that by using other annexes of the peace agreement as a direct base for the analysis, not only in the context of <b>systematic</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the Annex IV. However, since the Court rejected the presented request of the appellants, it did not go into details concerning the controversial questions of the legality of the process in which the new Constitution (Annex IV) came to power and replaced the former Constitution of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Court used the same reasoning to dismiss the similar claim in a later case.|$|E
5000|$|A sacred king, {{according}} to the <b>systematic</b> <b>interpretation</b> of mythology developed by Frazer in The Golden Bough (published 1890), was a king who represented a solar deity in a periodically re-enacted fertility rite. Frazer seized upon {{the notion of a}} substitute king and made him the keystone of his theory of a universal, pan-European, and indeed worldwide fertility myth, in which a consort for the Goddess was annually replaced. According to Frazer, the sacred king represented the spirit of vegetation, a divine John Barleycorn. He came into being in the spring, reigned during the summer, and ritually died at harvest time, only to be reborn at the winter solstice to wax and rule again. The spirit of vegetation was therefore a [...] "dying and reviving god". Osiris, Adonis, Dionysus, Attis and many other familiar figures from Greek mythology and classical antiquity were re-interpreted in this mold. The sacred king, the human embodiment of the dying and reviving vegetation god, was supposed to have originally been an individual chosen to rule for a time, but whose fate was to suffer as a sacrifice, to be offered back to the earth so that a new king could rule for a time in his stead.|$|E
40|$|Immunological assays {{are highly}} favoured {{for their ability}} to readily {{discriminate}} subtle structural differences in complex biopolymers, such as proteins and polysaccharides. Immunological reactions previously reported with extracts from biominerals at least 70 Myr old have fuelled hopes that such biopolymeric structures can survive the process of fossilization. We have raised antibodies against biopolymers from a range of Recent brachiopod shells to reconstruct a fine-grained pattern of phylogenetic relationships. Using the same antibodies, the phylogenetic affinities of fossil relatives were tested. Immunological reaction patterns for Plio-Pleistocene shells were essentially identical to the patterns of modern shells (although the breadth of reactivity was narrowed) and entirely consistent with current <b>systematic</b> <b>interpretations.</b> Older samples (> 4 – 21 Myr) were immunologically reactive, but failed to satisfy the criterion of systematic specificity. Our results provide an unequivocal demonstration that original macromolecular structures capable of yielding systematic information are preserved and accessible for immunological analysis for at least two million years. Non-specific reactions observed with the older material may relate in part to formation of mineral-induced diagenetic determinants (MIDDs...|$|R

40|$|For {{interpreting}} past {{changes on}} a regional or global scale, the timings of proxy-inferred events are usually aligned {{with data from}} other locations. However, too often chronological uncertainties are ignored in proxy diagrams and multisite comparisons, {{making it possible for}} researchers to fall into the trap of sucking separate events into one illusionary event (or vice versa). Here we largely solve this ‘suck in and smear syndrome’ for radiocarbon (14 C) dated sequences. In a Bayesian framework, millions of plausible age-models are constructed to quantify the chronological uncertainties within and between proxy archives. We test the technique on replicated high-resolution 14 C-dated peat cores deposited during the ‘Little Ice Age’ (c. AD 1400 - 1900), a period characterized by abrupt climate changes and severe 14 C calibration problems. Owing to internal variability in proxy data and uncertainties in age-models, these (and possibly many more) archives are not consistent in recording decadal climate change. Through explicit statistical tests of palaeoenvironmental hypotheses, we can move forward to <b>systematic</b> <b>interpretations</b> of proxy data. However, chronological uncertainties of non-annually resolved palaeoclimate records are too large for answering decadal timescale questions. ...|$|R

His book Identity of England (2002) received significant critical acclaim. His most recent book, George Orwell: English Rebel, was published by Oxford University Press in 2013.

5000|$|The {{classical}} scholar Jane Ellen Harrison called Totem and Taboo one of {{the most}} important works in her intellectual life. Harrison's work Themis: A Study of the Social Origins of Greek Religion (1912) has been compared to Totem and Taboo, since Harrison and Freud both attempted to find a universal mechanism that would account for the origins of religion. The novelist Thomas Mann wrote that Totem and Taboo had made a stronger impression on him than any of Freud's other works, and that of all Freud's works it had the greatest artistic merit. The feminist Simone de Beauvoir criticized Totem and Taboo in The Second Sex (1949), writing that Freud is forced to [...] "invent strange fictions" [...] to explain the passage from [...] "the individual to the society"; she saw the inability to explain this transition as a failing of psychoanalysis. Author Georges Bataille argued that Freud was misled by the [...] "superficial knowledge of ethnographical data" [...] typical of his time into concluding in Totem and Taboo that the taboo on touching corpses generally countered a desire to touch them. The classical scholar Norman O. Brown criticized the work in Life Against Death (1959), writing that Freud correlates psycho-sexual stages of development with stages of history, thereby seeing history as a [...] "process of growing up". Brown saw this view as a [...] "residue of eighteenth-century optimism and rationalism", and found it inadequate as both history and psychoanalysis. The mythologist Joseph Campbell considered Freud's Totem and Taboo and Jung's Psychology of the Unconscious (1912) the two key works that initiated the <b>systematic</b> <b>interpretation</b> of ethnological materials through insights gained through the study of neurotic individuals.|$|E

40|$|Validation {{provides}} {{quality assurance}} that {{a hearing aid}} wearer’s needs are being met—that the solution meets not only their technical requirements (i. e., verification) but also their requirements for everyday communication. In the past 50 years, there have been repeated calls for better measures of hearing aid performance, with a general shift in validation toward the self-report of hearing, communication, and well-being through questionnaires. This chapter looks at these measures, examining the domains of hearing aid validation and how despite the growth in number of questions—a {{total of more than}} 1, 000 questions on hearing aids—the domains have evolved only slightly. The chapter then considers the ways in which a fundamental domain, “benefit,” is calculated. A large data set shows how different forms of benefit can lead to different <b>systematic</b> <b>interpretations.</b> While most objective measures for hearing aids are by definition verifications, the chapter discusses those objective measurements that approach validation by attempting to mimic aspects of everyday communication. The issues raised by these myriad forms of validation suggest that a viable measure of hearing aid benefit must incorporate measures of expectations and burdens for listener-specific conditions...|$|R
40|$|The Ediacaran Doushantuo biota {{has yielded}} fossils {{that include the}} oldest widely {{accepted}} record of the animal evolutionary lineage, as well as specimens with alleged bilaterian affinity. However, these <b>systematic</b> <b>interpretations</b> are contingent {{on the presence of}} key biological structures that have been reinterpreted by some workers as artefacts of diagenetic mineralization. On the basis of chemistry and crystallographic fabric, we characterize and discriminate phases of mineralization that reflect: (i) replication of original biological structure, and (ii) void-filling diagenetic mineralization. The results indicate that all fossils from the Doushantuo assemblage preserve a complex me´lange of mineral phases, even where subcellular anatomy appears to be preserved. The findings allow these phases to be distinguished in more controversial fossils, facilitating a critical re-evaluation of the Doushantuo fossil assemblage and its implications as an archive of Ediacaran animal diversity. We find that putative subcellular structures exhibit fabrics consistent with preservation of original morphology. Cells in later developmental stages are not in original configuration and are therefore uninformative concerning gastrulation. Key structures used to identify Doushantuo bilaterians can be dismissed as late diagenetic artefacts. Therefore, when diagenetic mineralization is considered, there is no convincing evidence for bilaterians in the Doushantuo assemblage...|$|R
