40|$|Interaction between {{seals and}} {{fisheries}} along the Swedish coast has serious {{environmental and economic}} consequences. This thesis describes the conflict as it affects four different small-scale coastal fisheries; the eel fisheries on the west coast, the herring fisheries and salmon fisheries in the northern Baltic and the cod fisheries in the central Baltic. Knowledge gained through studies {{of the interaction between}} seals and fisheries has been instrumental for the development of alternative seal-safe fishing gear and mitigation methods. For some fisheries the improved understanding has led to a resolution of certain parts of the conflict. Certain coastal fisheries in the Baltic, such as the herring gillnet fishery, are at the point of collapse because of this conflict. Damage caused by grey seals to this fishery {{has been shown to be}} much more extensive than previously recognised. When <b>seals</b> raid <b>nets,</b> a significant part of the catch is lost without trace. Seals remove fish from nets without leaving any remains. This represents a hidden loss. Another hidden loss is caused by the presence of seals around fishing gear, which scares away fish from the area. The result is often a total loss of catch. Hidden losses are also evident in the gillnet fishery for cod in the central Baltic sea. In recent years damage by seals in the cod gillnet fishery has increased significantly. Due to the high value of cod the cod fishery is currently one of the fisheries that suffer the highest economic loss by seal damage. Seal-safe fishing gear is at present the only long lasting solution which would meet the needs of both seals and fishermen. Mitigation of damage to catch and fishing gear as well as the prevention of accidental by-catch are two sides of the same problem; a solution to one is also a solution to the other. However, development of new fishing gear is challenging and time-consuming. It requires better knowledge of both fish and seal behaviour. At present suitable alternative fishing gear is not available for the herring fisheries carried out through the whole season. However, a herring trap has been developed as an alternative fishing gear for catching spawning herring in spring time. In the cod gillnet fishery, promising results have been achieved in trials of an alternative fishing gear - the two-chamber pot. Another coastal fishery in the Baltic subjected to damage by grey seals, is the salmon trap net fishery in the North Baltic. A seal-safe salmon trap has been developed and is used by most of the salmon fishermen. This so called pontoon trap prevents the seal from reaching the catch by keeping the fish in an enclosed seal-safe fish chamber. However, in recent years there have been reports of damage by seals also in the pontoon trap. By filming the seals attacking traps it has been possible to identify 10 individual seals hunting in the traps and to determine that these same animals returned to the traps over a long period of time. It is possible therefore, to limit or decrease damage to the fisheries by limiting access for or by culling the individual seals specialized in raiding fishing gear. On the west coast of Sweden the eel fyke net fishery suffers from damage by harbour seals. In order to find a lasting solution to the conflict, seal behaviour has been studied as well as the fyke nets' fishing efficiency. The issue of whether it is the eels or the by-caught species which motivate harbour seals to attack fyke nets was studied. It was shown that harbour <b>seals</b> raiding fyke <b>nets</b> have a preference for eel. Certain harbour seals that specialise in foraging at fyke nets, have developed different feeding preferences compared to those of most <b>seals.</b> Seal-safe fyke <b>nets,</b> which resisted attacks while still being efficient in terms of yield, have been developed. They are already in use in commercial fishery along the west coast...|$|R

It is distributed all around Greenland with the main distribution north of 69 °N on the west coast and north of 66 °N on the east coast. During 1974 - 76, studies were conducted in the most important ringed seal catching area,. Upernavik, Northwest Greenland, and a total of 7, 089 ringed seals were sampled. The methods used for catching ringed seals were categorised into five different groups. The most common hunt-ing method used in the municipality of Upernavik during 1974 - 76 was netting under the ice, ac-counting for almost half of the total annual catch.

That increase is having a dramatic effect on the wildlife, environment and culture of the high Arctic. In an interview for the Arctic I.C.C.E. Project, Savissavik hunter Simon Eliason said hunters are spending more time in the fjords (rather than on the sea ice) because there is less sea ice on which to hunt seal, walrus and polar bear. He also said that hunters who <b>net</b> <b>seals</b> under the ice in winter must pull in those nets within hours after an animal is caught.

40|$|The {{conflicts}} between seals and fisheries along the Swedish west coast have intensified {{during the last}} decades, concurrently {{with the increase in}} the harbour seal population size. This study presents published information about interactions between harbour seals and fisheries in the Kattegat-Skagerrak, in addition to new information on the seal by-catch rate and an overview of fisheries suffering from seal damage. Several fisheries have reported interactions with seals, principally fisheries with fyke nets, gill nets and static gear. Development of mitigation measures has been focused on the eel fishery with fyke nets, in which the use of stronger net material has significantly decreased the damage frequency from seals and has yet maintained the catches at satisfactory levels. Under-water filming at fyke nets together with studies of the prey preferences of seals has shown individual specializations in certain foraging techniques.

The increasing seal stocks cause notable damage to fisheries in the Baltic Sea, with {{an unknown number}} of seals drowning in fishing gear every year. Thus, sustainable seal management requires updated knowledge of the by-catch of seals [...] the number of specimens that die in fishing gear. We analyse the by-catch of grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) in Finland, Sweden, and Estonia in 2012. We collect data with interviews (35 in Finland, 54 in Sweden, and 72 in Estonia) and analyse them with a hierarchical Bayesian model. The model accounts for variability in seal abundance, seal mortality and fishing effort in different sub-areas of the Baltic Sea and allows us to predict the by-catch in areas where interview data was not available. We provide {{a detailed description of the}} survey design and interview methods, and discuss different factors affecting fishermen's motivation to report by-catch and how this may affect the results.

To develop efficient interventions to minimize {{the negative impact of}} seals on fisheries, it is essential to understand the behaviour of seals in the fishery area, such as where and when they occur. The present study characterizes an instance of human–seal conflict, using acoustic telemetry to examine patterns in the occurrence of three Kuril harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) around a small fixed set-net in Akkeshi Bay, eastern Hokkaido, Japan, in late spring in 2009. To examine the environmental variables affecting the occurrence of Kuril <b>seals</b> around the <b>net,</b> 3 Kuril <b>seals</b> were captured and tracked using an acoustic monitoring system. Two of the tracked individuals (a male and a female) usually came to the net in the evening, and at high tide, but the seals were never present at times when fishing occurred (04 : 00 – 07 : 00 h), which indicates that they actively avoided human activity in the coastal fishery. Seals did not appear in the net after the fishery season (April), a behavioural characteristic that suggests that these seals were adults that used a nearby haul-out site during the breeding season (May–June). A third individual, an adult male, never occurred near the net. These observations demonstrate the extent to which individual seals vary in their interactions with human activities. Given the current selective removal of seals in the fishery area by controlled killing or driving away, these findings have the potential to inform targeted management intervention to minimize conflict between economic and conservation interests...|$|R

The Penguins failed to close out the Eastern Conference Finals with a sweep of the Flyers in Game 4, losing 4–2. The Flyers jumped out to a 3–0 lead in the first period. The Penguins fought back getting two goals from Jordan Staal in the third period, but Joffrey Lupul's second goal on an empty <b>net</b> <b>sealed</b> the win for the Flyers. The series returned to Pittsburgh for Game 5, where the Penguins won their eighth consecutive home game by a final score of 6–0, the Prince of Wales Trophy, and a trip to the Stanley Cup Final.|$|R
40|$|The {{ringed seal}} (Phoca hispida) {{is the most}} {{important}} game for the Inuit hunters of Greenland, providing many of the basic needs in the original culture. It is distributed all around Greenland with the main distribution north of 69 °N on the west coast and north of 66 °N on the east coast.   During 1974 - 76, studies were conducted in the most important ringed seal catching area, Upernavik, Northwest Greenland, and a total of 7, 089 ringed seals were sampled. The methods used for catching ringed seals were categorised into five different groups. The most common hunting method used in the municipality of Upernavik during 1974 - 76 was netting under the ice, accounting for almost half of the total annual catch. Seals shot on the ice and seals shot at the ice edge accounted for one fifth and one tenth of the annual catch, respectively. In this region seals shot in open water made up about one fifth of the annual catch of ringed <b>seals,</b> while <b>netting</b> in open water contributed only a few percent. Of the seals sampled in Upernavik in 1974 - 76, 60 % were males and 40 % were females. In the ringed seal samples collected all around Greenland in the 1980 s and 1990 s the males comprised  56 % and the females 44 % (n= 923). Similar ratios were found for all age classes and for all hunting methods suggesting either a skewed sex ratio in the ringed seal stock(s) around Greenland or a difference in availability to the hunters of male and female ringed seals. In tagging experiments a higher mobility was found for females than for males, which suggests differences in the behaviour of the two sexes. Catch and trade statistics on ringed seals are reviewed and evaluated for the period of 1954 until  1994, and the seasonal and regional variation is examined. The peak season for ringed seal hunting in Greenland as a whole is from January through May. This is particularly evident for the northern regions, where relatively few ringed seals are taken during the open water season from June to September. In the southern regions, however, the great majority of ringed seals are caught in open water. In all regions, the catch of ringed seals showed great annual and long-term variation. The variations were not identical in all regions, but similar trends were found for Northwest and Central West, and for Southwest and South. From 1954 to 1994 there was a general, significant increase in the reported catches of ringed seals in west Greenland. For Greenland overall, the catch of ringed seals was around 43, 000 per year in the 1950 s, peaked in the late 1970 s at almost 100, 000 per year, but since decreased to about 70, 000 in the early 1990 s...|$|R
40|$|The {{conflict}} between grey seals, Halichoerus grypus, and the Swedish cod fisheries in the Baltic Sea has steadily increased {{during the past}} 10 years. Seals locate the fishermen’s nets, damage the catch and tear holes in the nets. In this study we investigated the damages caused by <b>seals</b> on the <b>net</b> fishery for cod, Gadus morhua, in the central Baltic Sea. Damage includes both the visible damage and the hidden damage i. e. the fish that are taken whole without leaving any visible trace or damages to the nets. To gather the required data an observer joined two professional fishermen {{for a period of}} tree months in 2005. During that period all catch were recorded together with any visible damages. On some experimental links of nets the caught fish were marked without being removed from the net. The net was reset and when retrieved again the number of damaged or lost marked fish was noted. Corrections to the data were made to account for fish that spontaneously fall off. On 101 out of 184 links set out damaged fish were found. Damaged fish was most often found as small remains or with only the head of the fish left. At 20 out of 31 occasions when fish were left in the net, marked fish were missing or found damaged indicating a seal visit. 64. 3 percent of the marked cod were removed from the damaged links without leaving any visible trace, and an additional 10. 1 percent were damaged adding up to a total damage of 74. 4 percent of the catch. There was also a significant difference in catch per effort (cod caught per 100 m* 24 h) between damaged and non-damaged experimental links. Our findings show that the damage to the cod fishery caused by seals is large and that damage can not only be estimated by observing and counting retrieved damaged fish. The hidden damage is significant an...|$|R
