40|$|Nonlocal correlations, {{a longstanding}} {{foundational}} topic in quantum information, have recently found application {{as a resource}} for cryptographic tasks where not all devices are trusted, for example in settings with a highly secure central hub, such as a bank or government department, and less secure satellite stations which are inherently more vulnerable to hardware "hacking" attacks. The asymmetric phenomena of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen <b>steering</b> <b>plays</b> a key role in one-sided device-independent quantum key distribution (1 sDI-QKD) protocols. In the context of continuous-variable (CV) QKD schemes utilizing Gaussian states and measurements, we identify all protocols that can be 1 sDI and their maximum loss tolerance. Surprisingly, this includes a protocol that uses only coherent states. We also establish a direct link between the relevant EPR steering inequality and the secret key rate, further strengthening the relationship between these asymmetric notions of nonlocality and device independence. We experimentally implement both entanglement-based and coherent-state protocols, and measure the correlations necessary for 1 sDI key distribution up to an applied loss equivalent to 7. 5 km and 3. 5 km of optical fiber transmission respectively. We also engage in detailed modelling to understand the limits of our current experiment and the potential for further improvements. The new protocols we uncover apply the cheap and efficient hardware of CVQKD systems in a significantly more secure setting. Comment: Addition of experimental results and (several) new author...|$|R

40|$|Three river basins, i. e., the Yangtze river, the Mississippi {{river and}} the Loire river, were {{presented}} as case studies to explore the association among atmospheric circulations, moisture exports and extreme precipitations in the mid-latitudes. The major moisture source regions in the tropics for the three river basins are first identified using the Tropical Moisture Exports (TMEs) dataset. The space-time characteristics of their respective moisture sources are presented. Then, the trajectory curve clustering analysis {{is applied to the}} TMEs tracks originating from the identified source regions during each basin’s peak TMEs activity and flood seasons. Our results show that the moisture tracks for each basin can be categorized into 3 or 4 clusters with distinct spatial trajectory features. Our further analysis on these clustered trajectories reveals that the contributions of moisture release from different clusters are associated with their trajectory features and travel speeds. In order to understand the role of associated atmospheric steering, daily composites of the geopotential heights anomalies and the vertical integral of moisture flux anomalies from 7 days ahead to the extreme precipitation days (top 5 %) are examined. The evolutions of the atmospheric circulation patterns and the moisture fluxes are both consistent with the TMEs tracks that contribute more moisture releases to the study regions. The findings imply that atmospheric <b>steering</b> <b>plays</b> {{an important role in the}} moisture transport and release, especially for the extreme precipitations. We also find that the association between TMEs moisture release and precipitation is nonlinear.

By introducing a so-called joint-point locus approach, equilibria {{of the system and}} their associated stability properties are given geometrically. With this method, it is discovered that the difference between the front and the rear <b>steering</b> angles <b>plays</b> a key role in vehicle system dynamics and that the topological structure of the phase portrait and the types of bifurcations are different from those published previously. In particular, the vehicle system could still be stabilized even when pushed to work in a certain severely nonlinear region, by applying extremely large steering angles. However, it is worth noticing that the attractive domain of the stable equilibrium is very narrow. These developments might prove to be important in active steering control design.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model and}} its simulation results of an agricultural vehicle electrohydraulic (E/H) steering system. The dynamic characteristics of an E/H <b>steering</b> system <b>plays</b> {{an important role in}} realizing accurate steering control for an automatically guided agricultural vehicle. E/H steering systems are typically nonlinear with large deadband, asymmetric flow gain, time delay, hysteresis, and saturation, which result in difficulties in the system analysis, design, and control. In this paper, a mathematical model has been developed for an E/H steering system. This model has taken the main components of the E/H steering system, including a PWM driver, an E/H proportional directional control valve, steering actuating cylinders, steering linkage, and wheel-ground interactions, into consideration. It was then linearized with assumptions of incompressible fluid, the zero lapped valve, and frictionless. This model has been validated via vehicle steering tests. A third order liner model with considering the deadband, saturation, and time delay could well approximate the dynamic response within the steering angle range of 15 to 15 degrees. The validated model was used to estimate the dynamic behaviors of E/H steering systems in steering controller design. Those parameters are critical for designing high performance steering controller...|$|R

40|$|The {{steering}} {{principle of}} tropical cyclone motion {{has been applied}} to tropical cyclone forecasting and research for nearly 100 years. Two fundamental questions remain unanswered. One is why the <b>steering</b> flow <b>plays</b> a dominant role in tropical cyclone motion, and the other is when tropical cyclone motion deviates considerably from the steering. A high-resolution numerical experiment was conducted with the tropical cyclone in a typical large-scale monsoon trough over the western North Pacific. The simulated tropical cyclone experiences two eyewall replacement processes. Based on the potential vorticity tendency (PVT) diagnostics, this study demonstrates that the conventional steering, which is calculated over a certain radius from the tropical cyclone center in the horizontal and a deep pressure layer in the vertical, plays a dominant role in tropical cyclone motion since the contributions from other processes are largely cancelled out due to the coherent structure of tropical cyclone circulation. Resulting from the asymmetric dynamics of the tropical cyclone inner core, the trochoidal motion around the mean tropical cyclone track cannot be accounted for by the conventional steering. The instantaneous tropical cyclone motion can considerably deviate from the conventional steering that approximately accounts for the combined effect of the contribution of the advection of the symmetric potential vorticity component by the asymmetric flow and the contribution from the advection of the wave-number-one potential vorticity component by the symmetric flow...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Improving {{health care}} quality {{requires}} effective and timely spread of innovations that support evidence-based practices. However, {{there is limited}} rigorous research {{on the process of}} spread, factors influencing spread, and models of spread. It is particularly important to study spread within the home care sector given the aging of the population, expansion of home care services internationally, the high proportion of older adult users of home care services, and the vulnerability of this group who are frail and live with multiple chronic conditions. The {{purpose of this study was}} to understand how best practices related to older adults are spread within home care organizations. Methods Four home care organizations in Ontario, Canada that had implemented best practices related to older adults (falls prevention, pain management, management of venous leg ulcers) participated. Using a qualitative grounded theory design, interviews were conducted with frontline providers, managers, and directors at baseline (n = 44) and 1  year later (n = 40). Open, axial, and selective coding and constant comparison analysis were used. Results A model of the process of spread of best practices within home care organizations was developed. The phases of spread included (1) committing to change, (2) implementing on a small scale, (3) adapting locally, (4) spreading internally to multiple users and sites, and (5) disseminating externally. Factors that facilitated progression through these phases were (1) leading with passion and commitment, (2) sustaining strategies, and (3) seeing the benefits. Project leads, champions, managers, and <b>steering</b> committees <b>played</b> vital roles in leading the spread process. Strategies such as educating/coaching and evaluating and feedback were key to sustaining the change. Spread occurred within the home care context of high staff and manager turnover and time and resource constraints. Conclusions Spread of best practices is optimized through the application of the phases of spread, allocation of resources to support spread, and implementing strategies for ongoing sustainability that address potential barriers. Further research will help to understand how best practices are spread externally to other organizations...|$|R
40|$|Bobsleigh is {{a winter}} sport in which teams make timed runs down narrow, twisting, banked, iced tracks in gravity-powered sleds. To {{win the race}} it is of great {{importance}} to have a sled that is optimized from both the sliding and the aerodynamic point of view. However, also typical vehicle parameters, such as the weight distribution and the inclination of the <b>steering</b> axis, <b>play</b> an important role. In fact, being the friction coefficient between skates and ice very small (approx. 0. 04), an change in the weight acting on the front skates may significantly modify the steering feedback of the driver thus highlighting his/her driving ability. Better trajectories imply less corrections on the steering axis and thus better performances. The inclination of the steering axis, instead, generates a torque similar to the self-aligning torque produced by road vehicle tires thus stabilizing the front skates and requiring less control ac-tions to the sled driver. Up to now, bobsleigh design {{has been carried out}} mainly {{on the basis of the}} feedback of ath-letes. The drawback of this approach is that it leads to small modifications in the bobsleigh design and it does not allow to objectively identify the influence of the applied modifica-tions/innovative solutions on the bobsleigh overall performance. To be able to quantify the influence of certain design changes on the performance of bob-sleighs, it was decided to set up a multi-body model of a two-men sled. To validate the nu-merical model an experimental campaign with an instrumented bobsleigh was carried out at Cesana Pariol Olympic Park. During the tests, the bobsleigh was instrumented with two iner-tial gyroscopic platforms to measure the dynamics of the two frames constituting the bob-sleigh body, sixteen strain gauge channels to measure the ice-skates contact forces, one optical sensor to measure the bobsleigh speed and one potentiometer to measure the steer an-gle imposed by the driver.

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Motivated by {{observations}} of locally enhanced sea level variability near steep topographic slopes in regions of strong time-mean flows, effects of zonal ridge topography on zonal oceanic jet flow are investigated. Unstable wave properties and {{the dynamics of}} eddy-mean flow interaction are evaluated {{as a function of}} topographic geometry using a 2 -layer, quasigeostrophic, nonlinear, finite-difference, numerical model and two-dimensional linear stability analysis. During model spinup, the timing of the transition from nearly laminar to more turbulent flow and properties of developing linearly unstable waves vary with the height and width of the zonal ridge. Mean shear at this transition, and growth rate, phase speed, and wavelength of the most unstable mode depend primarily on topographic slope. The structure of the most unstable mode differs, however, for short and narrow ridges, as compared with tall, wide ridges. This shift affects properties and dynamics of the most unstable mode during the linear phase of wave growth. An evaluation of energy and momentum budgets during the finite-amplitude stage of wave development indicates that effects of topography on mean shear at the onset of turbulence and on the location of wave development control the time-evolution of eddy-mean flow interaction. Results from zonally uniform topography can be generalized to cases with along-stream variations in ridge geometry. The structure of the time-mean flow, distribution of time-dependent eddies and contribution of time-dependent eddies to the maintenance of time-mean energy and vorticity balances are considered as functions of along-stream variations in ridge height and width during the fully turbulent, statistically steady phase of numerical simulations. Along-stream variations in topography steer the time-mean jet, inducing along-stream modulations in ambient potential vorticity gradient at the location of the jet. As a result, the stability of the jet, the distribution of time-dependent eddies, and locations of significant eddy feedbacks on the time-mean flow vary along-stream. Topographic <b>steering</b> may therefore <b>play</b> {{a major role in the}} geographical distribution of sea level variability observed by altimetry...|$|R
3000|$|With the {{technological}} development for unconventional {{oil and natural}} gas productions, the numbers of horizontal and three-dimensional multi-target directional wells have increased significantly (Ozkan et al. 2011; Jia et al. 2014; Orem et al. 2014). Drilling equipment not only needs to meet requirements for desired drilling trajectory, but also needs to work reliably in more complex stratum and harsher operating conditions, which presents significant challenges on the drilling technology (John et al. 2000; Kaiser and Yu 2015; Ikonnikova et al. 2015). In recent decades, rotary steerable systems (RSS) have developed very rapidly, in their capability to provide continuous rotation, constant steering, and smoother boreholes (Weijermans et al. 2001; Drummond et al. 2007; Hakam et al. 2014). RSS ensure steering the borehole when drill string is rotating, and are usually used together with a logging while drilling (LWD) system. Geological parameters are analyzed in real time, and then precise control of the directional trajectory is achieved based on geological conditions (Haugen 1998; Tribe et al. 2001; Torsvoll et al. 2010). So far, Schlumberger’s PowerDrive, Baker Hughes’ AutoTrak, and Halliburton’s Geo-Pilot have been the main representative technologies (Stuart et al. 2000; Tribe et al. 2001; Bian et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2014). RSS can be divided into static bias and dynamic bias according to different bias units and can also be divided into push-the-bit and point-the-bit approaches according to different directing principles. PowerDrive and AutoTrak belong to “push-the-bit,” while Geo-Pilot belongs to “point-the-bit” type. PowerDrive is of dynamic bias, while AutoTrak is of static bias (Schaaf 2000; Fontenot et al. 2005; Wang et al. 2014). This article focuses on three static push-the-bit (RSSTSP) like AutoTrak systems. RSSTSP have three stretching pads, which press against the well bore thereby causing the bit to press on the opposite side resulting in a direction change (Niu et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2014, Marck and Detournay 2016). <b>Steering</b> control algorithm <b>plays</b> an important role in any RSSTSP, and a robust control algorithm is the key factor to achieve the desired control effects (Seifabad and Ehteshami 2013; Hakam et al. 2014; Kremers et al. 2015).Because many of these techniques are not available to the public, the research papers for control algorithm for RSSTSP are very few in the published literature. Zhang and Yu analyzed the configuration and deviation principle of RSSSTP (Zhang 2000). Cheng and Jiang studied control method, using biasing displacement vector (Cheng et al. 2010). Du and Liu studied multi-solution and uncertainty for controlling three pad forces. Models were established with two pads and adapted to adjust and control magnitude and orientation of steering force vector, and another pad extended to wellbore without force (Du et al. 2008). Due to non-unique solutions, Li et al. (2015) proposed to use three pads working at the same time, where one pad force should have a maximum or minimum value determined by relative position of pad and steering forces. The aforementioned papers mainly deal with how to calculate steering force. However, vibrations, stability, and durability were not considered. Therefore, based on the structure and work process of RSSTSP, this work develops mechanical and mathematical models for the steering force and pad force. A new control algorithm is developed considering factors of steerability, stability, durability, “favorable area,” and “unfavorable area.” [...]...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{expenditure}} review initiative (ERI) was {{launched by the}} Department of Finance in May 1997. The intention is to promote systematic analysis {{of what is being}} achieved by government spending. Guidelines issued by the Department of Finance state that areas of expenditure that cut across departmental boundaries {{should be included in the}} review process. The Expenditure Review Central Steering Committee (ERCSC), which oversees the ERI, decided that it would be wise to undertake a small number of pilot cross-departmental reviews with a view towards designing systems for and approaches to such reviews that would be capable of being transferred to other departments and offices. Departments and offices were asked to suggest topics. In May 2002, as part of its general discussion on the {{expenditure review}} process, the government approved the following two topics for review, with nominated lead departments: · Cross-departmental expenditure review of supports for the long-term unemployed (Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment) · Cross-departmental expenditure review of the government’s strategy for road safety 1998 - 2002 (Department of Transport). The CPMR was asked to provide a review of the lessons learned from the pilot exercises and to develop practical guidelines for the future practice of cross-departmental reviews. Findings from the pilot reviews The initial timescale for the pilot cross-departmental reviews envisaged their commencement in October 2002 with a view to their completion in 2003. In practice, the EXECUTIVE SUMMARY reviews were not completed until the end of 2005. In many ways this delay in the production of the reports is the main issue for consideration in terms of progressing crossdepartmental reviews in the future. A number of systemic factors that lead to delays in the carrying out of crossdepartmental expenditure reviews were identified: · The effect of other government priority projects on the conduct of the cross-departmental reviews. The Community Enterprise scheme policy review and other urgent priorities impacted on the Supports for the Long- Term Unemployed review, and the development of a new road safety strategy impacted on the Road Safety review. These other priorities took precedence in terms of resource availability. · The establishment and oversight of steering committees. In some instances, other departments were slow to respond to invitations to participate in the steering committee for the review. · The absence of agreed, dedicated resources (both personnel and financial) from the start of the review process led to lengthy discussion as to how to resource the cross-departmental expenditure reviews. Changes occurred in the personnel dedicated to the reviews which of themselves increased the delays, with new people needing to familiarise themselves with the issues. With regard to the main findings from the review reports that were finally produced, a number of key points emerge: · One of the main strengths and benefits of the pilot cross-departmental reviews is that they manage to pull together information on expenditure for the areas under scrutiny that had not been available before in a comprehensive manner. · Both review reports attempt to assess the performance of programmes and measures. Data deficiencies caused difficulties with this exercise. But, despite these difficulties, both pilot review reports provide useful analysis and comments about performance. A significant potential contribution of the pilot crossdepartmental expenditure reviews is that they point towards the development of new performance indicators to allow a more comprehensive assessment of performance in the future. Both reports are strong in this regard. · Synthesis and overview of the findings - how well the various programmes examined work together - occurred but is probably the weakest aspect of the pilot crossdepartmental reviews. Lessons learned In terms of learning lessons from the pilot exercise, a number of key lessons emerge as being important for the conduct of future cross-departmental reviews. The prioritisation of cross-departmental expenditure reviews In terms of thinking how cross-departmental expenditure reviews might receive higher priority in the future, approaches to ensuring reviews which receive priority include: · Formal notification of priority. In this context, the listing of participation in cross-departmental reviews in the statements of strategy and business plans of all participating departments is important (as suggested for reviews generally by the ERCSC [in Department of Finance, 2004]). · Sign-off on terms of reference and resourcing. The secretaries general of all departments concerned should be asked to sign-off on the terms of reference and on the resources they intend to make available to the review. In addition, secretaries general could be asked to signoff at key stages in the review. · Report sign-off by all participants. Currently, the secretary general of the lead department signs off each cross-departmental review report. Consideration should be given to having cross-departmental reviews signed off by the secretaries general of all participating departments. · Political oversight. The choice of topics for crossdepartmental reviews should be a matter for specific government decision. Copies of completed review reports should be forwarded to the relevant Oireachtas committees when completed. Resourcing cross-departmental expenditure reviews If resourcing of the cross-departmental reviews is not to continue to be an issue into the future, consideration needs to be given to ensuring that there is clarity from the initiation of an individual review as to how it is to be staffed and financed. A number of options are possible: · The lead department for the cross-departmental review can take sole responsibility for staffing and financing the review, with other departments on the <b>steering</b> committee simply <b>playing</b> an oversight role. This may or may not involve contracting out of the conduct of the review analysis to consultants. The danger here is that such an arrangement does not solve the type of problems encountered in the pilot cross-departmental reviews. · Participating departments in the steering committee can pool resources (both personnel and financial) to jointly resource the cross-departmental review. Again, analysis may be done either through consultants or staff assigned to the review from participating departments. Experience from the pilot projects indicates that such commitments will need to be clearly established at the start of the process, with sign-off by the secretaries general of the participating departments. · A central pool of resources could be made available to provide support for cross-departmental reviews. With regard to this option, it should be noted that the ERCSC welcomed the decision by the Department of Finance to bring about a gradual integration of the NDP/CSF evaluation unit into the ERI (Department of Finance, 2004). The NDP/CSF evaluation unit has experience in carrying out and commissioning evaluations of a crosscutting nature. Whichever option is chosen, what is important is that all the key stakeholders in the cross-departmental review are aware from the start of their resource commitments and are willing to ensure that these commitments are adhered to. Some mixture of the options is also possible, with either of the first two options being facilitated by a central resource that could be brought in to provide expertise at a particular stage or to conduct a particular piece of analysis for the cross-departmental review. Terms of reference for cross-departmental expenditure reviews While each individual cross-departmental review will have its own specific terms of reference, there are common issues that most cross-departmental reviews would be expected to address. Just as there are generic terms of reference provided by the Department of Finance as a guide for departmental expenditure reviews, it is helpful to have generic terms of reference for cross-departmental reviews. Items to be considered for inclusion in generic terms of reference are: · identify common agreed objectives, results and strategies · map the existing expenditure levels and trends in expenditure · outline the structures and processes used to manage and report on expenditure · assess the efficiency and effectiveness of contributory programmes and the extent to which information is being used to track and improve performance · make recommendations as to the development of future performance indicators and information requirements · make recommendations as to absolute and relative shifts in expenditure in order to achieve desired outcomes. Methodological issues associated with conducting cross-departmental reviews The evaluation of cross-departmental expenditure poses particular methodological problems. Often, the building block for review of cross-departmental programmes and strategies is the evaluation of individual measures. But separate evaluations of individual measures, which by their nature are likely to be distinct and different from each other, in practice often tells us very little about how crossdepartmental programmes and strategies as a whole are working. This was issue encountered by the two pilot cross-departmental reviews. In this context, it is important that the methodologies used in carrying out crossdepartmental reviews includes an element of synthesis across measures and programmes to allow an overview of resource allocation and potential reallocation decisions to be considered. Given these methodological issues, cross-departmental reviews are often likely to need specialist expertise that may not be available in line divisions in departments. In terms of the resourcing issue, departments may need to access particular expertise either centrally held (for example within planning units or the Department of Finance) or externally contracted. Such expertise should be seen as complementary to, and not a substitute for, the involvement of local management in reviews. Progressing recommendations As the pilot review reports had only been recently completed at the time of this study, it is not possible to comment on the implementation of recommendations. However, it is likely that cross-departmental reviews will pose particular challenges in terms of tracking the implementation of recommendations. For standard expenditure reviews, departments are required to put in place systems to ensure that the response to recommendations by their organisations is tracked and reported on regularly to their management advisory committee. This action should also apply to crossdepartmental review recommendations. In addition, when reporting on progress, copies of reports should be sent to the lead department with responsibility for the crossdepartmental review, to enable it to provide an overview of progress with regard to the implementation of recommendations. Also, relevant Oireachtas committees should be sent copies of completed cross-departmental expenditure review reports, and be facilitated if they request subsequent information on progress with regard to the implementation of recommendations. Consideration should also be given to means of ensuring a more direct link between the crossdepartmental reviews and expenditure decisions arising from the budgetary process...|$|R
