50|$|Repeated consanguineous marriages {{within a}} group are more problematic. After {{repeated}} generations of cousin marriage the actual genetic relationship {{between two people}} is closer than the most immediate relationship would suggest. In Pakistan, {{where there has been}} cousin marriage for generations and the current rate may exceed 50%, one study estimated infant mortality at 12.7 percent for married double first cousins, 7.9 percent for first cousins, 9.2 percent for first <b>cousins</b> once removed/double <b>second</b> <b>cousins,</b> 6.9 percent for <b>second</b> <b>cousins,</b> and 5.1 percent among nonconsanguineous progeny. Among double first cousin progeny, 41.2 percent of prereproductive deaths were associated with the expression of detrimental recessive genes, with equivalent values of 26.0, 14.9, and 8.1 percent for first cousins, first <b>cousins</b> once removed/double <b>second</b> <b>cousins,</b> and <b>second</b> <b>cousins</b> respectively.|$|R
