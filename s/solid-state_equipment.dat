5000|$|PM-3A: 1.75 MW electric, plus {{heating and}} desalinization. McMurdo Station, Antarctica. Owned by the Navy. Initial {{criticality}} March 3, 1962, decommissioned 1972. The PM-3A, located at McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, {{was designed by}} the Martin Company to provide electric power and steam heating to the Naval Air Facility at McMurdo Sound. PM-3A operated at a uranium-235 enrichment of 93 percent.The PM-3A (Portable, Medium-power, 3rd generation) was a plant installed to provide power for the McMurdo Base in Antarctica. During 1970-1971, it achieved a world-record power run. It {{was one of the}} first shore-based power plants to use <b>solid-state</b> <b>equipment.</b> The PM-3A was not operated by the Army, but was under the NAVFAC (Naval Facilities Engineering Command [...] "Sea Bees"), shore-based power division of the US Navy. Although the majority of the personnel were Navy, the PM-3A was a tri-service stationing. For 1970-1971, there was an Army Sergeant and an Air Force Sergeant stationed with the crew. The plant was air-cooled with the condensers and fan units running glycol. Waste heat was also used for desalination using vacuum flash distillation. The reactor was located in buried tanks in the ground. After decommissioning, the plant was cut into pieces and transported to the US for burial. The soil surrounding the tanks had become radioactive, so it was also removed and transported to Port Hueneme Naval Base, California, where it was incorporated into asphalt pavement.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the factors}} bassists {{keep in mind when}} {{selecting}} a combo amp or an amp head is the amount of [...] "headroom" [...] that the amplifier will provide them, given their intended performance venue and music genre. [...] "Headroom" [...] refers to the amount by which the signal-handling capabilities of an audio system exceed a designated nominal level. Headroom {{can be thought of as}} a safety zone allowing transient audio peaks to exceed the nominal level without damaging the system or the audio signal, e.g., via clipping. In loud music genres and in genres where bassists seek a clean, clear bass tone, bassists seek to avoid power amplifier clipping, so they typically choose amplifiers which provide enough headroom to avoid power amp clipping. Headroom has been defined as a [...] "...safety zone or wiggle room"."Having enough headroom is essential for <b>solid-state</b> <b>equipment</b> like bass amplifiers and power amplifiers. If you lack this, you can expect a harsh mid range tone, a lack of dynamics and possibly blown speakers". Having enough headroom is also important for bassists seeking to retain a [...] "clean" [...] sound even in loud, high-volume performance settings.Bassists pairing an amplifier [...] "head" [...] of a certain wattage and a speaker cabinet (or speaker cabinets) with a certain wattage power-handling capacity may require advice from music store amplifier expert or an audio engineer. One of the reasons that many beginning bassists choose combo amps when they are starting is because with a combo amp, the manufacturer has ensured that the speaker and power amp are compatible from a power handling and impedance perspective. While there is a widespread belief that an amplifier with a rated wattage that is higher than the rated wattage on a speaker cabinet will harm the speaker, in fact, a clean, un-clipped power amplifier signal can be above the rated wattage of a speaker without damaging the speaker, as long as the power amp is sending out a clean, unclipped signal. There is a much higher risk of damaging a speaker when a clipped (unintentionally distorted) power amplifier signal is sent through it, even if the wattage is far below the rated wattage of a speaker. For example, a bassist could use a 700 watt power amp which is running with zero power amp clipping through a speaker cabinet rated at 500 watts without damaging the speaker; however, if a 100 watt power amp that is heavily clipping is plugged into the speaker cab, this could blow the speaker.|$|E
40|$|Power {{electronic}} loads {{resulting from}} the <b>solid-state</b> <b>equipment</b> are constantly increasing in distribution systems. It {{has been estimated that}} after 2000 static power converters will be process 60 % of the total electric power. The non-linear nature of switching devices such as thyristors give rise to harmonic current flows in power transmission lines, thus causing considerable losses and voltage distortion, electronic equipment failure, and inefficient use of electric energy. Active power filters have become a promising alternative for controlling harmonic levels in industrial and commercial facilities. However, many different filter configurations can be employed. There is no standard method for rating them. This paper describes an implementation of active power filters aimed at correcting poor power factors of a hydro power plant excitation system.

30|$|Computer and {{telecommunication}} {{facilities in}} that era were moving from electro-mechanical <b>equipment</b> to <b>solid-state</b> electronics. Increasing <b>equipment</b> densities and power consumption were leading to higher airflows being needed for cooling. Len Gibson and John Petersen at the Australian Post-Master Generals’ Department (PMG) were finding that ceiling mounted smoke detectors were failing to detect fires early enough, particularly smouldering fires, before significant damage occurred to more sensitive electronic equipment. Often this led to serious service interruptions and major business and community impacts. Longer-term, insidious damage was often caused by corrosion from the HCl vapours being emitted from overheated PVC cable insulation.|$|R

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this project was the design, {{installation}} and refinement of a fully-automated, six-slide projector, multi-image, multi-media presentation system for the electronic response (ER) instructional component of the general studies biology course (Biology 100) at Ball State University. Secondary emphasis was on the development, production and evaluation of three software programs that would utilize and test {{the capabilities of the}} hardware system. Modular design was used in the fabrication of the multi-image system. Major electronic components used were: one custom-modified Sony Quadradial Stereo Tapecorder Model 854 - 4, one Dynaco Stereo Preamplifier PAT- 4 A, one Dynaco Stereo Amplifier Model 120 A, two Acoustic Research Speakers Mcdel AR- 3 a, one Tandburg Tape-Slide Synchronizer Model 3, one custom-modified Motiva Twelve-Channel Programmer, three custom-modified Kodak Carousel Dissolve Controls Model 2, and six Kodak Ektagraphic Slide Projectors Model E- 2. The system was installed in a custom-designed multi-media cabinet which was located for forward projection onto a custom-built twelvefoot wide screen. Special features of the system included: (1) remote start, (2) control of room lights, (3) independent control of projector lamps within piggyback groups, (4) control of projectors via dissolve controls, (5) integration of half-screen with full-screen visuals, (6) fast recycle of slide projectors at program end, and (7) automatic tape recorder stop and rewind at program end. The software developed for use with the multi-image system consisted of three, group-paced, linear, student response programs titled: Aggression, Territoriality and Survival; Time, Adaptation and Change; and Man, Communication and Behavior. Major steps in the software development process were: (1) program narrative writing and editing; (2) program question writing and editing; (3) identification of visuals, music, and special effects; (4) chartographic and photographic production of visuals; (5) synchronization flowsheet preparation; (6) preparation of paper synchronization tape; (7) preparation of narrative tape with musical background; and (8) synchronizatior of narrative tape with visuals for automated presentation and recycle. Evaluation of the multi-image system involved five, regularlyscheduled sections of Biology 100 classes (approximately 120 students) during Autumn Quarter 1975. A fifteen question, multiple-choice pretest was administered prior to interaction with each student response program; and an identical post-test was administered immediately following each program. Hence, student immediate short-term learning vas measured. Results were computer tabulated and t ratios for non independent means of the pre- and post-tests were determined. The frequency and percentage of students selecting the preferred responses on the preand post-tests, and the percentage increase or decrease were also determined. Analysis of data indicated that there were significant gains in short-term cognitive learning as demonstrated by the results of the t values for the non independent means of the pre- and post-tests which were: 23. 949 for Aggression, Territoriality and Survival; 23. 064 for Time, Adaptation and Change; and 22. 194 for Man, Communication and Behavior. These t values were significant at beyond the. 001 level. Gains in percentage increase resulted on forty-four of the forty-five post-test questions. These results indicate that a well-designed and properly functioning multi-image projection system in conjunction with well-designed software and an independent student response system can be used as an effective instructional tool. Rapid advances in the electronics equipment field preclude the exact duplication of this multi-image system. However, the <b>solid-state</b> <b>equipment</b> currently available will probably circumvent certain equipment shortcomings identified {{during the course of this}} project. More in-depth research studies are recommended to identify those factors within multi-image presentations which cause or reinforce student learning. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{identify}} a candidate material for spin-triplet superconductivity with a two-component order parameter. This unconventional superconducting state is thought to allow for exotic quantum states such as Majorana fermions. A wide survey was taken into potential candidate materials, and UAu 2 was chosen for in-depth investigation. This little-studied hexagonal heavy fermion compound's unusual resistivity behaviour, combined {{with a series of}} interesting features in magnetisation and heat capacity, make it an extremely interesting material to study. The phase diagram of UAu 2 was determined with measurements of heat capacity, resistivity, magnetisation and magnetoresistance on the first single crystalline samples of this material. No superconductivity was detected. Instead, a range of magnetic phase transitions were observed, which were further investigated with muon-spin relaxation experiments and time-of- ight neutron powder diffraction. UAu 2 was found to undergo a transition to an incommensurate antiferromagnetic state (q 1 = (1 = 3; 1 = 3; δ)) below TN = 43 : 5 K, but then develops signatures of weak ferromagnetism below T = 20 K. The ferromagnetism coincides with a 2 q magnetic structure, with a coexistence of q 1 and q 2 =(1 / 3, 1 / 3, 0). The magnetic structures of both phases were found to be most likely amplitude-modulated, with moments aligned along the crystallographic c-axis. A transition to a ferromagnetic state was observed in magnetic fields applied parallel to the c-axis. TN was found to remain almost constant in applied magnetic fields up to 9 T, while hydrostatic pressures of up to 6 kbar weakly suppress the antiferromagnetic transition temperature. The field-induced transition was found to be strongly pressure-dependent, shifting to higher applied fields with increasing pressure. The residual resistivity of UAu 2 samples prepared by both the Czochralski method and quenching from the melt is relatively large, which may inhibit Cooper pairing and hence may be the reason for the absence of superconductivity in the samples investigated. <b>Solid-state</b> electrotransport (SSE) <b>equipment</b> was developed, which can induce the motion of a crystal's constituents and thereby lead to vastly improved sample quality. Refinement of UAu 2 samples with SSE could be a further step in the search for spin-triplet superconductivity in this material...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) spectroscopy {{has emerged as}} one of the most important methods for the solid-state characterisation of polymers. The popularity of NMR is due to the fact that many molecular level features can be measured from the NMR spectra, including the polymer chain conformation, the morphology and the dynamics. The spectral features and relaxation times are affected by local interactions, so they provide information about the structure of polymers on a length scale (2 - 200 A) that is difficult to measure by other methods. In favourable cases, the NMR experiments provide a molecular-level explanation for the transitions observed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and other methods, and the NMR properties can often be related to the bulk properties. Solid-state NMR has long been of interest in polymer science, and the first solid-state NMR studies of polymers were reported approximately a year after the discovery of nuclear resonance in bulk matter. It was reported in this initial study that the proton line width for natural rubber at room temperature is more like that of a mobile liquid than of a solid, but that the resonance broadens near the glass transition temperature (T_g). This was recognised as being related to a change in chain dynamics above and below the T_g. NMR methods developed rapidly after these initial observations, first for polymers in solution and, more recently, for polymers in the solid-state. Solid-state NMR studies of polymers were developed more slowly than their solution-state counterparts because solid-state NMR requires more specialised <b>equipment.</b> <b>Solid-state</b> NMR is now such an important tool that most modern spectrometers are capable of performing these studies. The interest in the NMR of solid polymers is due in part to the fact that most polymers are used in the solid state, and in many cases the NMR properties can be directly related to the macroscopic properties. Polymers have restricted mobility in solids, for example, and the chemical shifts can be directly related to the chain conformation. Solid-state NMR is also an efficient way to monitor the reactivity of polymers, since chemical changes often result in large spectral changes. The relaxation times in solids depend not only on the chain dynamics, but also on the morphology over a length scale of 20 - 200 A. NMR has been extensively used to measure the length scale of mixing in blends and multiphase polymers, and the domain sizes in semicrystalline polymers. Solid-state NMR methods have been greatly expanded with the introduction of multi-dimensional NMR. These studies have led to a molecular level understanding of the dynamics traditionally observed by dielectric and dynamic-mechanical spectroscopy, and a better understanding of the relationship between polymer morphology and macroscopic propertiesSIGLEAvailable from British Library Document Supply Centre-DSC: 7291. 760 (vol 11 no 8 (128)) / BLDSC - British Library Document Supply CentreGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
