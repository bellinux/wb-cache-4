40|$|Modern {{economic}} growth involves {{the flow of}} capital and labor between the agricultural and nonagricultural sectors. The terms of trade between the agricultural and nonagricultural sectors affect that flow. To find {{the role of the}} terms of trade in economic development, I have analyzed its effect on the transfer of capital between agriculture and nonagriculture and factors affecting changes in the terms of trade, from the perspective of economic development in Japan and Taiwan. When the terms of trade are favorable to the agriculture sector, it attracts more capital investment, its production shifts upwards, and labor productivity increases. This expansion of production increases the marketable <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> and turns the terms of trade against the sector. Any actual deterioration in the terms of trade induces investors to allocate a larger share of investment to the other sector; but that in time leads to relative overproduction and consequent deterioration of that sector's terms of trade. Such investment behavior, responsive to changes in market conditions throughout the economy, has therefore caused relatively faster growth of one sector in one period, and of the other in next. In both Japan and Taiwan the movement in the terms of trade correlates well with the relative growth rates of the two sectors. Agriculture's terms of trade improved when the sector's growth was relatively slow compared to nonagriculture and declined when growth was relatively fast. As the terms of trade turned in favor of the agricultural sector, it attracted more capital investment...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{will be an}} {{exploration}} of the issues of building in the Egyptian landscape. Human inhabitation of the Egyptian landscape has for many thousands of years been centred within the zone of the Nile River valley. In the past, this ribbon of arable land was able to support the food requirements of the population and produce a <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> for export. Today, Egypt's population of 54 million exists on 30, 000 km. 2 of habitable area concentrated in the Nile River valley out of a total area of approximately one million sq. km. The population is growing rapidly, and in fact, in areas of urban growth, illegal building is occurring on scarce arable land. In the 1970 's, in an effort to divert such growth, strategies for newtowns situated in the interior of the desert were planned, and several were executed. However, I propose to put forward an attitude of growth that would run North-South, to build on the desert edge, above and parallel to the Nile valley where existing arable land meets desert and to extend arable zones into the desert. In the course of this project, I will examine a) -as preface -the Nile valley in context to the historic development of an irrigation society: trace the domestication of the Nile. b) -as observation of the desert - formal and spatial inhabitations in the regional landscape and from other similar landscapes c) - as projection of the possible-an agricultural research centre which by its raison d'etre will maintain a distinction of what landscape is built and what remains free for new cultivation. The building will include work spaces, labs, sleeping and living facilities for both permanent and short term staff. by Perihan S. Boutros-Ghali. Thesis (M. Arch.)

30|$|Since primary {{education}} became free and compulsory in Kenya in 2003, formal education {{has become more}} accessible to Pokot children. This has led {{to changes in the}} household economy, caused by the connected schooling costs and other monetary requirements- because, even if {{primary education}} has officially been provided free of charge since 2003 in Kenya, several monetary needs arise when sending a child to school, such as for books, uniforms and other expenses. Several female respondents saw the increase in primary schooling as a contributing factor to why women have become increasingly involved in the monetary economy, as they are present in the household and therefore often the ones the young children turn to for small monetary needs. These petty household needs are not ranked as necessitating the sale of sheep and goats by the male household head. Consequently, women have to plan, prepare and invest adequately for these expenses. It is therefore not surprising to find women parading roasted maize, bananas, avocadoes, mangoes and sugarcane for sale on the Kapenguria-Kainuk roadside in Chepareria. The same applies to milk at dusk and in the early mornings. The <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> these <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> has only been readily available locally since the people of Chepareria started enclosing their land, which led to an increase in the growing of fruits and vegetables, as well as to increased milk production, as there was pasture available all year round. In connection to this, the nutritional variety and the number of meals per day have also increased with time (Awino Ochieng and Karmebäck 2014 a, b).|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the main modalities and solutions by which agriculture and rural development can represent factors of economic-financial crisis shock attenuation and resuming economic growth. It is without {{doubt that the}} main modality to increase agriculture contribution to the general economic growth is the capital injection into economic factors (investments that create jobs, increase production and productivity on the agricultural holdings, develop infrastructure in the rural areas), {{the best use of}} financial resources by funding systems adequate to the present situation whose effects should stop the economic decline and subsequently generate economic growth. Romania, a EU Member State since 2007, must “get in line” with the funding systems used in agriculture and rural development in the European Union. However, a main remark should be made. All the CAP funding systems, adopted by the EU, from its establishment up to the present moment (except for the first system, in use in the immediate period after the Common Market was established), have been funding systems designed and implemented under strong general economic and agricultural growth conditions, for the equilibration of the agricultural market (in most cases with <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>products),</b> family farm consolidation and environment and landscape protection conditions, animal welfare, etc. Taking into consideration the period of generalized economic and financial crisis, in the paper it is specified that none of the funding systems of agriculture and rural development in the EU has been designed for periods of generalized economic-financial crisis or economic recession, so that certain points of view presented below, with regard to the modalities to attenuate the crisis in agriculture and to increase this sector contribution to economic growth relaunching, might be in (relative) disagreement with the present CAP funding system, adopted by the EU. agriculture and rural development; economic-financial crisis; recession; CAP; investments;...|$|E
40|$|If ACP {{countries}} are {{to improve their}} agricultural productivity they must do so through their rural people. And, if full employment, food self-sufficiency and an exportable <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> are to be achieved, rural people must tee motivated. Owner ship of land is a powerful incentive, especially among young people who see no future for themselves as hired labour but who arewilling to work atbuilding up their own family holding. In the majority of Caribbean countries, widespread land ownership is very recent but, in several countries where land reform and re-distribution has begun, the benefits are already evident. For much of their modern history most Caribbean countries were developed as plantation economies, where {{the mass of the}} population worked as labour on monoculture estates owned by a minority of landowners or foreign-based companies. However, many foreign-based companies, and even some large local landowners, found the combination of poor prices for the main plantation crops (banana, citrus, cocoa, coconut and sugar) and rising labour costs and unrest in the 1970 s too problematic, and either sold up or abandoned their estates. As a result, governments gained possession and were provided with the opportunity to offer the land in small blocks to previously landless people. Privatization in Grenada In Grenada, by 1983 a succession of governments had acquired 36 estates, ranging from 17 - 105 hectares (40 - 250 acres). In 1986 it was decided by the Government to 'divest' these estates: to divide them into economically viable units and to offer them for private ownership. In common with the majority of islands in the Caribbean, Grenada has a very steep terrain so at divestment, farmers were encouraged to continue to grow one of the major crops - banana, cocoa and nutmeg but to diversify by growing other crops for food and for sale. In order to do this without encouraging erosion, a programme of soil and water conservation was started in which the farmers were involved. With FAO technical assistance, settlers were helped to build bench terraces, of eyebrow terraces, access roads and dams. A wide range of fruit trees was planted, while leucaena and Honduran Pine were planted on the steepest land as conservation forest The idea was to provide improved income, long-term security and to involve the new settlers in sustainable production techniques. Considerable progress has been made: people in Grenada are increasingly aware of the need for food self-sufficiency and import-substitution; more locally produced foods are available in markets and for the thriving tourist industry; and surplus fruit is processed for jams, jellies and confectionery. There has been a deliberate policy to choose young people as new settlers and {{there is no shortage of}} applicants: there are 30 - 40 applicants for each farm that becomes available, of whom 80 %- 90 % are in the 25 - 30 age group. Dominica diversifies Similar success has been achieved in Dominica, where the main plantation crops were banana and limes. Again, these remain the major crops on the small farms that have been carved from the big estates. Where banana still offers a good return, some far' mers continue to specialize in the crop, but others have diversified into vegetables and tubers for the local market, ginger for export and also flowers such as ginger lily. In the drier south of the island limes were and remain the major crop but, because of the depressed price over several years, farmers settled here have diversified and grow passion fruit, Aloe vera and forage grasses for feeding to one or two milk cows and 10 - 15 sheep and goats. Some farmers are also keeping one or two breeding pigs. However, land redistribution is seldom sufficient when carried out in isolation, so in Grenada and Dominica, new farmers have been provided with technical advice and assistance with marketing their crops. In Dominica the marketing of new crops has been well developed through the Dominican Export and Import Agency, DEXIA (See Spore N 20). There is a processing facility for limes on the island and a factory for coconut products, such as oil and soap. Aloe vera, a low-growing, succulent plant that thrives on dry, porous soils, is purchased by the Windward Island Aloe Company and is used in a wide range of cosmetics and body-care products. All these marketing intitiatives have resulted in firm markets, increased local employment and added value to products, to the benefit of farmers and the national economy. Integrated development Credit has also played an important role in developing the small-farmer economy in Dominica, as has the construction of feeder roads into previously inaccesible parts of the island. The United Nations lnternational Fund for Agricultural Development has assisted by providing funds for credit while IFAD and the European Development Fund have financed access roads. It is clearly evident that without an integrated approach of technical advice, credit, availability of inputs, access roads and marketing, land redistribution alone would not have had the desired impact and might even have resulted in stagnant production, frustration and a decline in standards of soil and water conservation. If ACP {{countries are}} to improve their agricultural productivity they must do so through their rural people.

The Americans and Diem feared a communist electoral victory and national polls never took place. In October, Diem proclaimed himself {{the president of the}} newly formed Republic of Vietnam after he won a fraudulent referendum, and the aid continued as the US wanted to build a strong and stable anti-communist state in Southeast Asia. When the program was first introduced, it generated turbulence for merchant importers in Vietnam. As {{a large proportion of the}} imports up to that point had been from France, traders who were dependent on selling French products found themselves in difficulties as their wares would now be more expensive than those of import licenseholders who now had access to cheaper American alternatives. The suppliers of French goods threatened to organize a strike, but this never materialized. At the time, South Vietnam was also suffering from a lack of foreign currency reserves and the CIP was seen as an urgent mechanism of remedying this. The introduction of the CIP brought an unprecedented new level of economic liberalism and capitalism, and at first, the entrepreneurial class struggled to meet the challenges of a deregulated market, leading to a series of significant shortages and <b>surpluses</b> <b>of</b> various goods due to their inexperience in judging market forces and resultant imbalances in the economy. Initially 25,000 applications for import licenses were received, many from speculators.

Firstly, consumers feel unfair in their minds in the process of negotiation; secondly, the purchase decision rule tends to be simplified in the â€œlemon marketâ€ <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> products; thirdly, the consumers tend to follow the masses in the â€œlemon marketâ€ <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>products.</b> The economics significance of the impact of â€œlemon dilemmaâ€ <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> on consumers is analyzed. The causes of the impact are analyzed from two aspects the uncertainty of collecting the information <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> information and the uncertainty <b>of</b> using the <b>agricultural</b> information. The suggestions and countermeasures are put forward in order to solve the â€œlemonâ€ problems in agricultural market. In the first place, the excellent mechanism for producing the information <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> should be constructed; in the second place, the government should encourage the multi-channel, multi-form and multi- level operation mode <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>products,</b> to promote the optimization of market functions; in the third place, the government should widen the channel of information dissemination for <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> and establish the high efficiency feedback path; in the fourth place, the traditional thought pattern of consumers should be changed, so as to promote the healthy, orderly and benign development <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> market. <b>Agricultural</b> <b>products</b> market, Lemon dilemma, Consumer, Market risk, China, Agribusiness,...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – Economies in East Asia are at {{different}} development stages. Economic development {{has an impact}} on factor endowments and the intensities, then on the mode <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> trade. To examine the trade modes of these seven East Asian countries' <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> will give us some hints to understand the question how economic development impacts the changing patterns in comparative advantage (CA) <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>products.</b> Therefore, this paper aims to test the question by using a four-quadrant method. Design/methodology/approach – Trade specialization coefficient is used to analyze the agricultural CA among aggregated <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> and two typical kinds of products: labor- and land-intensive <b>agricultural</b> <b>products.</b> Then a four-quadrant method is applied in this study, where trade specialization <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> consists <b>of</b> 2 D: labor-intensive and land-intensive. The study intends to test the changing routes <b>of</b> CA <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> under the background of economic development and changing situation of factor endowments. Findings – The analysis result supports that economic development has impact on the trade mode <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>products.</b> Originality/value – The four-quadrant method is firstly applied to analyze the changing pattern <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> in East Asian countries. This study shows that the changing routes <b>of</b> CA <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> will not limit to only one mode as found by current studies. Agriculture, Far East, Trade...|$|R
