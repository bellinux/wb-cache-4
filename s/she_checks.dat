500|$|The gestational {{period is}} of {{seven to eight}} months, after which a single calf is born. A female about to give birth {{isolates}} herself from her group, and remains alone for some days afterward. The newborn calf weighs [...] Around 50% of the calves die within {{the first six months}} of birth, and only 25% can survive after three years. In a study at Basle Zoo (Switzerland), where 43% of the offspring from captive breeding died before reaching the age of six months, the major causes of high juvenile mortality were found to be the spread of white muscle disease and deficiency of vitamin E and selenium in diets. The herd size, sex, interbreeding, and season did not play any role in juvenile mortality. The mother hides her calf while she goes out to feed, and returns mainly in the evening to suckle her young. <b>She</b> <b>checks</b> the calf's identity by sniffing its rump or neck. In the first month, suckling may occur for eight minutes. The mother and calf communicate with low bleats. She licks her offspring, particularly in the perineal region, and may consume its excreta.|$|E

2500|$|In American and Canadian {{metropolitan}} areas, XM and its Canadian licensee [...] "Canadian Satellite Radio" [...] (CSR) {{and operating}} as Sirius XM Canada, {{owned and operated}} a network of approximately 900 terrestrial repeater stations, meant to compensate for satellite signal blockage by buildings, tunnels, and bridges. In the United States XM owned and operated approximately 800 repeater sites covering 60 markets; in Canada CSR was installing approximately 80 to 100 repeaters that was planned to be {{owned and operated by}} CSR in the 16 largest Canadian cities. The actual number of repeater sites varies as the signal is regularly tested and monitored for optimal performance. The actual number of sites in the United States has dropped from the original 1,000 installed when the service first launched in 2001. The repeaters transmit in the same frequency band as the satellites. A typical city contains 20 or more terrestrial stations. Typically, the receiver owner is unaware when a terrestrial station is being used, unless he or <b>she</b> <b>checks</b> antenna information from the receiver being used. Due to a FCC filing in October 2006, the latest list of XM's US terrestrial repeater network was made available to the public.|$|E

60|$|Truly Mr Pecksniff is blessed in his children--in one of them, at any rate. The prudent Cherry--staff and scrip, and {{treasure}} of her doting father--there she sits, {{at a little}} table white as driven snow, before the kitchen fire, making up accounts!

The very onions dangling from the beam, mantle and shine like cherubs' cheeks. Something {{of the influence of}} those vegetables sinks into Mr Pecksniff's nature. He weeps.|$|E
