5|$|Justice John Marshall Harlan concurred in the judgment, {{but did not}} author a <b>separate</b> <b>opinion.</b>|$|E
5|$|The four Democratic judges concurred on the {{majority}} opinion. Two Republican judges, in a <b>separate</b> <b>opinion,</b> concurred with {{the majority}} opinion, but declared that Taylor and Marshall had been done an irreparable injustice. The lone dissent, authored by the court's third Republican, held that the contest board had acted outside its legal authority. Republicans turned to the Supreme Court of the United States as their final option.|$|E
25|$|Justice Douglas, in a <b>separate</b> <b>opinion,</b> with {{emphasis}} somewhat {{different from the}} court's, joined in the court's opinion.|$|E

50|$|Justices Brennan and Stevens wrote <b>separate</b> <b>opinions</b> {{that were}} dissenting.|$|R
5000|$|Bonello {{has been}} {{considered}} a [...] "liberal" [...] judge. He has probably been the only judge whose <b>separate</b> <b>opinions</b> were published during his tenure. Judge (later Court President) Nicolas Bratza and leading authority on Human Rights Law Michael O'Boyle published them with Wolf Legal Publishers of the Netherlands. His <b>separate</b> <b>opinions</b> were also collected in the book When Judges Dissent, published in 2008.|$|R
25|$|In {{reaching}} its conclusion, {{each of the}} seven Justices issued a <b>separate</b> <b>opinion.</b> Combining this with {{the fact that there is}} little case law referencing section 117, there remains significant debate over the nature and extent of the right contained within it.|$|E
25|$|On August 19, 2007, a three-member {{condemnation}} panel set {{the value}} of the land at $23.8 million by a vote of 2 to 1. The next day, a <b>separate</b> <b>opinion</b> valuing the land at $33.2 million was filed by the dissenting judge. The landowners immediately announced that they would appeal the condemnation ruling, and a court date was set for November.|$|E
25|$|Ellsworth's chief legacy as Chief Justice, however, is his discouragement of the {{previous}} practice of seriatim opinion writing, in which each Justice wrote a <b>separate</b> <b>opinion</b> {{in the case and}} delivered that opinion from the bench. Ellsworth instead encouraged the consensus of the Court to be represented in a single written opinion, a practice which continues to the present day.|$|E
50|$|Justices Kennedy and Thomas wrote <b>separate</b> <b>opinions</b> concurring in judgment, but disagreeing {{that the}} {{residual}} clause of ACCA is unconstitutionally vague.|$|R
40|$|A {{quantitative}} and qualitative analysis of the <b>separate</b> <b>opinions</b> in the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights (n= 106, from November 1998 until September 2006) reveals the following patterns: a) judges elected in respect of the new member States of Central and Eastern Europe deliver significantly less <b>separate</b> <b>opinions</b> than judges elected in respect of the old member States; b) national bias {{in the sense that}} the judges take a more benevolent position when their home country is the respondent State does in fact occur, and more so among ad hoc judges than among elected judges; and c) the lawyer‐statesmanʹs perspective seems to prevail in the majority judgment while human rights activism finds an outlet in <b>separate</b> <b>opinions.</b> Interviews with (19) judges enrich these data with insights into the social and institutional context of judicial decision making in the Grand Chamber...|$|R
50|$|The European Court of Human Rights {{uses the}} term concurring opinion and calls both concurring and dissenting <b>opinions</b> <b>separate</b> <b>opinions.</b> Judges very rarely add {{declarations}} to the judgment.|$|R
25|$|Aside from Roe v. Wade, notable {{majority}} opinions {{written by}} Blackmun include Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, Bigelow v. Commonwealth of Virginia, and Stanton v. Stanton. He joined part of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's opinion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey but also filed a <b>separate</b> <b>opinion,</b> warning that Roe was in jeopardy. He wrote dissenting opinions in notable {{cases such as}} Furman v. Georgia, Bowers v. Hardwick, and DeShaney v. Winnebago County.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{lawsuit was}} {{filed in the}} District Court for the Northern District of California in San Francisco in 1999. The parties agreed in the district court to limit their initial arguments {{to the question of}} whether the case constituted a political question. The district judge dismissed the case in 2003 on the grounds that it constituted a political question. In a <b>separate</b> <b>opinion,</b> the district court dismissed the claims against the Croatian Liberation Movement on the grounds of lack of personal jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., 497 U.S. 1 (1990), was a United States Supreme Court {{case that}} {{rejected}} {{the argument that}} a <b>separate</b> <b>opinion</b> privilege existed against libel. It was seen by legal commentators {{as the end of}} an era that began with New York Times Co. v. Sullivan and continued with Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., in which the court clarified and greatly expanded the range and scope of what could be said in the press without fear of litigation.|$|E
50|$|Judges may deliver joint {{judgments}} or {{give their}} own <b>separate</b> <b>opinions.</b> Decisions and Advisory Opinions are by majority, and, {{in the event}} of an equal division, the President's vote becomes decisive, which occurred in the Legality of the Use by a State of Nuclear Weapons in Armed Conflict (Opinion requested by WHO), 1996 ICJ Reports 66. Judges may also deliver <b>separate</b> dissenting <b>opinions.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Supreme Court {{decided the}} case in a 5-4 {{majority}} opinion delivered by Lewis Franklin Powell, Jr., with a separate concurrence by Harry Blackmun. All four dissenting justices filed <b>separate</b> <b>opinions.</b>|$|R

25|$|Near {{the end of}} its term, in June 1987, the Court {{announced}} its decision. By a 5–4 margin it ruled for Shearson, holding that Wilko did not cover claims under the 1934 Act and that the RICO claims, too, were to be arbitrated. Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the majority. Harry Blackmun wrote an opinion that concurred with the RICO holding but dissented from the 1934 Act holding, joined by William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, who had written for the Court in Byrd. John Paul Stevens wrote a <b>separate</b> <b>opinion</b> along the same lines.|$|E
25|$|Soon after {{becoming}} Chief Justice, Marshall changed {{the manner in}} which the Supreme Court announced its decisions. Previously, each Justice would author a <b>separate</b> <b>opinion</b> (known as a seriatim opinion) as was done in the Virginia Supreme Court of his day and is still done today in the United Kingdom and Australia. Under Marshall, however, the Supreme Court adopted the practice of handing down a single opinion of the Court, allowing it to present a clear rule. As Marshall was almost always the author of this opinion, he essentially became the Court's sole spokesman in important cases. Marshall also got rid of the tradition that U.S. Supreme Court justices had inherited from the British of wearing ornate powdered wigs and red robes with ermine trim.|$|E
25|$|Justice Stevens {{joined the}} Court's decision. He stated, though, that {{he issued a}} <b>separate</b> <b>opinion</b> only to clarify his belief that there was the {{possibility}} of further debate on the constitutional limitations of a state's ability to punish assisted suicide. As the second-most senior Justice on the Court (after Chief Justice Rehnquist), {{it is likely that}} Stevens' would have written the opinion himself had Rehnquist not elected to do so. This much is suggested by the length of Stevens' concurrence which runs several pages (official format) longer than Rehnquist's opinion. It is possible that the Chief Justice was in part persuaded to exercise this ability by the fact that Stevens' concurrence offers a less concrete view of the state's ability to regulate euthanasia than the majority of the Justices seem to support.|$|E
40|$|This {{collection}} contains {{the most important}} <b>separate</b> <b>opinions</b> of Judge Loukis Loucaides, member of the European Court of Human Rights from 1998 until 2008. It collates a decade of disagreement with the Court's judgments by a judge with strong moral convictions about {{the interpretation of the}} Convention. His opinions were largely inspired by the legal principles he was dedicated to serving. <b>Separate</b> <b>opinions</b> offer valuable insight into different trends and schools of thought that inevitably influence the development of the Court’s case-law. Always eager, as he liked to say, “to call a spade a spade”. Judge Loucaides' opinions reflect his unfettered commitment to human rights and make for interesting reading...|$|R
50|$|The IMT {{spent six}} months {{reaching}} judgment and drafting its 1,781-page opinion. The {{reading of the judgment}} and the sentences lasted from December 4 to 12, 1948. Five of the eleven justices released <b>separate</b> <b>opinions</b> outside the court.|$|R
5000|$|The Court {{unanimously}} {{agreed that}} exercise of personal jurisdiction over Dennis Burnham based on [...] "transient jurisdiction" [...] through {{service of process}} was proper. However, the Justices could not agree on a rationale for the result, producing four <b>separate</b> <b>opinions.</b>|$|R
25|$|A {{little less}} than two decades earlier, in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445 (1976), the Court had held that Congress can {{abrogate}} state sovereign immunity pursuant to its powers under the Fourteenth Amendment, which clearly contemplates limiting {{the power of the}} states. In Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U.S. 1 (1989), the Court had held that Congress could also abrogate sovereign immunity under the Commerce Clause - but there was no majority in that decision. Justice Brennan was joined by three other justices in asserting that the Eleventh Amendment {{was nothing more than a}} reflection of common law sovereignty that could be swept aside by Congress; Justice Scalia was also joined by three other justices in taking the opposite view; and Justice Byron White wrote a <b>separate</b> <b>opinion</b> holding that Congress had such power, but stating his disagreement with Brennan's opinion (but not his own rationale).|$|E
25|$|Marshall ran a congenial court; {{there was}} seldom any bickering. The Court met in Washington {{only two months}} a year, from the first Monday in February through {{the second or third}} week in March. Six months of the year the justices were doing circuit duty in the various states. Marshall was {{therefore}} based in Richmond, his hometown, for most of the year. When the Court was in session in Washington, the justices boarded together in the same rooming house, avoided outside socializing, and discussed each case intently among themselves. Decisions were quickly made usually in a matter of days. Marshall wrote nearly half the decisions during his 34 years in office. Lawyers appearing before the court, including the most brilliant in the United States, typically gave oral arguments and often did not present written briefs. The justices did not have clerks, so they listened closely to the oral arguments, and decided among themselves what the decision should be. The court issued only one decision; the occasional dissenter usually did not issue a <b>separate</b> <b>opinion.</b>|$|E
500|$|Two Supreme Court {{decisions}} after Perez {{called into}} question the principle that loss of citizenship could occur even without the affected individual's intent. [...] In Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez (1963), the Court struck down a law revoking citizenship for remaining outside the United States {{in order to avoid}} conscription into the armed forces. [...] Associate Justice William J. Brennan (who had been in the majority in Perez) wrote a <b>separate</b> <b>opinion</b> concurring with the majority in Mendoza-Martinez and expressing reservations about Perez. [...] In Schneider v. Rusk (1964), where the Court invalidated a provision revoking the citizenship of naturalized citizens who returned to live permanently in their countries of origin, Brennan recused himself and did not participate in the decision of the case.|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} this paper is the legal {{institute}} of separate (dissenting and concurring) opinion of a judge who disagrees with the majority decision of a court chamber. Even though this institute has traditionally been considered a common law feature, most civil law countries recognise it, especially in constitutional matters. The paper deals with this institute not only from historical and comparative perspectives, but also from the legal and theoretical one. The author points to the reasons in favour of <b>separate</b> <b>opinions</b> such as freedom of speech and judicial independence, {{as well as to the}} reasons against it, e. g., legal certainty, clarity and persuasiveness of court judgements and also to their impact on integrity and reputation of courts. In the Croatian legal system <b>separate</b> <b>opinions</b> are in principle allowed at the level of regular courts, but it is not permitted to make them public. At the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Croatia <b>separate</b> <b>opinions</b> and presentation of the reasons for voting contrary to the majority as well as their publication are fully permitted. However, the Constitutional Court’s practice shows considerable reluctance of Constitutional Court judges to use these institutes...|$|R
5000|$|In a 3-2 decision, {{the appeal}} was dismissed, as no wrong was {{committed}} that {{was known to}} the law. <b>Separate</b> <b>opinions</b> were issued by all justices [...] Latham CJ, Dixon and McTiernan JJ for the majority, and Rich and Evatt JJ in dissent.|$|R
5000|$|The Court did {{not produce}} a {{majority}} opinion. Eight Justices authored <b>separate</b> <b>opinions,</b> and the respective stances on various issues did not always align with other Justices in their concurring or dissenting bloc. The issues addressed in various opinions included the following: ...|$|R
500|$|On May 19, 2005, the Kentucky Supreme Court {{issued a}} 4–3 {{decision}} {{stating that the}} General Assembly had acted unconstitutionally by not passing a budget and that Fletcher had acted outside his constitutional authority by spending money not specifically appropriated by the legislature. The majority opinion rejected the lower court's exception for [...] "specific essential services", saying [...] "If the legislative department fails to appropriate funds deemed sufficient to operate the executive department at a desired level of services, the executive department must serve the citizenry as best it can with what it is given. If the citizenry deems those services insufficient, it will exercise its own constitutional power — the ballot." [...] Chief Justice Joseph Lambert dissented, claiming the executive spending plan was necessary. Two other justices, in a <b>separate</b> <b>opinion,</b> disagreed with the majority that federal and state constitutional mandates should still be funded {{in the absence of}} a budget. In their dissent, they argued that the threat of a government shutdown would act as an impetus for the General Assembly to engage in timely budget-making. The decision took no retroactive steps to change the actions it ruled unconstitutional, but it served as a precedent for any future cases of budgetary gridlock.|$|E
2500|$|In a <b>separate</b> <b>opinion,</b> Justice Ginsburg further {{elaborated}} on why {{she thought}} qualified immunity was inappropriate in this case: ...|$|E
2500|$|Justice Thomas, {{siding with}} Alito, Roberts and Kennedy, in a <b>separate</b> <b>opinion,</b> held that, [...] "Salinas' Fifth Amendment {{privilege}} {{would not have}} been applicable even if invoked because the prosecutor's testimony regarding his silence did not compel Salinas to give self-incriminating testimony." [...] Justice Antonin Scalia joined Thomas' opinion." ...|$|E
50|$|The Court {{held that}} there were no {{violations}} of the Charter. L'Heureux-Dube J. wrote the majority, with La Forest, Sopinka, Gonthier, and Major JJ. concurring.

50|$|The Court {{upheld the}} Act as valid under the {{criminal}} law power but found that sections 4, 8, and 9 of the Act violated freedom of expression {{and could not be}} saved under section 1 of the Charter. There were four <b>separate</b> <b>opinions</b> given.|$|R
50|$|Six of {{the nine}} justices of the Supreme Court {{rejected}} Miller's challenge to the law, in three <b>separate</b> <b>opinions</b> that denied her citizenship claim for different reasons. Three justices dissented, agreeing with Miller that the law in question was impermissibly discriminatory {{and should have been}} struck down.|$|R
