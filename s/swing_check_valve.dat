50|$|A <b>swing</b> <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> or tilting disc {{check valve}} is {{a check valve}} in which the disc, the movable part to block the flow, swings on a hinge or trunnion, either onto the seat to block reverse flow or off the seat to allow forward flow. The seat opening {{cross-section}} may be perpendicular to the centerline between the two ports or at an angle. Although swing check valves can come in various sizes, large check valves are often swing check valves. The flapper valve in a flush-toilet mechanism {{is an example of}} this type of valve. Tank pressure holding it closed is overcome by manual lift of the flapper. It then remains open until the tank drains and the flapper falls due to gravity. Another variation of this mechanism is the clapper valve, used in applications such firefighting and fire life safety systems. A hinged gate only remains open in the inflowing direction. The clapper valve often also has a spring that keeps the gate shut when there is no forward pressure. Another example is the backwater valve (for sanitary drainage system) that protects against flooding caused by return flow of sewage waters. Such risk occurs most often in sanitary drainage systems connected to combined sewerage systems and in rainwater drainage systems. It may be caused by intense rainfall, thaw or flood.|$|E

40|$|The use of <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> in {{the nuclear}} {{industry}} is of great importance from a safety precaution point ofview (McElhaney, 1995). Choosing <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> for these high-pressurized systems comes with agreat challenge. The valves causes what is called <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> slams when closing, leading to a hugepressure wave traveling through the system. To prevent this from happening calculations have to bedone {{to see what kind}} of forces are generated during a <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> slam. When the forces are known itis easier designing systems that will endure these slams. A commonly used software {{in the nuclear}}industry is RELAP 5 (Reactor Excursion and Leak Analysis Program), its main purpose is to calculatetransients in piping systems.

By doing an experiment measuring pressures created by <b>swing</b> <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> during slams, the codewas compared to real data and analyzed to decide what was of importance when modeling for thesetypes of simulations. The RELAP 5 code was not initially designed to calculate transients during a <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> slam.

40|$|This master’s {{thesis is}} made to {{increase}} {{the understanding of the}} dynamic characteristics of a typical large <b>swing</b> <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> used in a system that transports pressurized water to a reactor tank. 3 D FSI-simulations are performed for a number of transients in order to study the dynamic characteristics their dependence of the deceleration rate. The purpose is to find information about the dynamics {{that could be used in}} a future improvement of a 1 D-model. Steady state simulations are performed for angles in the whole spectrum. Seven transient FSI-simulations with different constantly decelerating flows from 630 kg/s 2 (6. 7 m/s 2) to 40 320 kg/s 2 (430 m/s 2) have been performed. The pressure on the disc caused by the hydraulic torque is integrated and the corresponding torque contribution, together with the weight torque, is used in the second law of motion to calculate the movement of the disc throughout the transients. Steady state simulations yield the pressure drop over the valve, which could be compared with field measurements in order to validate the CFD-simulations. Comparison of the pressure distribution on the disc for the steady state and transient simulations shows the importance of taking the disc angular velocity into account when modelling in 1 D. Correlations between the angle, angular velocity, torque and mass flow are obtained from the transient FSI-simulations. Torque coefficients according to (Li & Liou, Vol. 125) are also brought out from the simulated transients, but in order to create a model in line with this approach further simulations have to be performed. A prediction of the pressure rise that occurs when a <b>swing</b> <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> closes in backward flow according to the Joukowsky equation is brought out and gives an idea of the loadings that the system has to be able to handle...|$|E
40|$|Simulations {{of water}} hammer {{transients}} are important e. g. regarding structural analysis of piping systems {{in a nuclear}} power plant. This project aims to validate TRACE with respect to analysis of such transients. Validation is performed against RELAP 5 and also, when available, against experimental data. RELAP 5 is currently used for such analyses at Ringhals nuclear power plant, and is approved by the authorities for this purpose. Since this system code {{is about to be}} phased out in a couple of years, it is of interest to determine whether TRACE may be a suitable successor. Five main cases are studied, including e. g steam collapse in horizontal and vertical pipes, closing of inertial <b>swing</b> <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> and other valves, as well as some pump modelling. The parameters of interest for this project are mainly process-related ones such as pressures, void fractions and mass ows. In some cases forces on the piping systems are considered. All simulations are carried out in both codes, and the results from TRACE are compared mostly to the corresponding ones from RELAP 5. Efforts are then made in TRACE to improve the results to be more similar to RELAP 5, e. g. by modifying the interfacial heat transfer coefficients. It is concluded that TRACE in general works as well as RELAP 5 for this type of analysis. There are some differences between the codes though, when it comes to certain modelling techniques and correlations. Further, a number of bugs and other problems exist in the software which need to be fixed. Also, both codes are rather poor at handling steam collapse. This may be due to a too small predicted interfacial area at the moments just before the last steam is about to collapse. In case the interfacial heat transfer is increased in TRACE, the modelling of steam collapse is slightly better in this code than in RELAP 5. However, further improvements are required in order to fully capture cavitation water hammers. Finally, it is noted that neither RELAP 5 nor TRACE is originally intended for use in analysing this kind of fast pressure transients...|$|R

Although it had been recognized by component experts that the two most significant factors in determining <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> performance were valve design (i. e., type) and operating conditions, no industry data was available relative to the former. In cooperation with the Nuclear Industry <b>Check</b> <b>Valve</b> Group (NIC), ORNL has reviewed and analyzed <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> failures from the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations` (INPOs`) Nuclear Plant Reliability Database System (NPRDS) according to several parameters,including valve type.

A series of flow tests using water and a water/gas mixture was conducted to identify the flow phenomenon which produced the cyclic wear. A Plexiglas outlet housing was utilized to view the flapper behavior under different flow conditions and to aid in high speed photography. The tests revealed that flow instabilities induced two oscillatory flapper responses: a rocking mode and a chattering mode. Initially, attempts were made to reduce the spring-flapper oscillations. However, the final solution to the problem was a springless configuration which satisfied the valve's design requirements and eliminated the oscillations.

40|$|A semi-empirical {{method is}} {{developed}} {{to describe the}} dynamic behaviour of <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> in pipeline systems. The method is based on parameterized valve models and dimensionless valve characteristics, which may be obtained from experiments. The <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> is considered as a black box with certain input and output characteristics. The <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> closure and associated pressure surges are the dominant phenomena. Undamped <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> may {{be considered as a}} special case of damped <b>check</b> <b>valves.</b> Much attention is paid to the description of the hydrodynamic (fluid) forces on the internal, moving valve elements. These elements may be considered as translating or rotating bodies with (at least) one plane of symmetry. The equations of motion for the constrained, unsteady motion of such a body in an unconfined, unsteady fluid flow are based on the dynamical theory of Kirchhoff, extended to an unsteady fluid flow. The equivalent equations for a body in a confined fluid are based on Lagrange's method of generalized coordinates. A general (dimensionless) valve equation of motion is developed, which is valid for most of the existing <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> types. Basic differential equations are derived for the transient flow in a pipe with constant initial flow deceleration. The equations are applied to describe the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> closure under reflection free and reflecting boundary conditions in the form of dimensionless, analytical equations. The theory is based on conventional waterhammer theory. The pipe and valve equations are coupled via the integral form of the momentum equation. The uncoupled and coupled, (dimensionless) pipe and valve equations show formally which (dimensionless) variables and valve, system and fluid parameters are relevant to the dynamic behaviour of <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> in pipeline systems. In that sense they are used in a dimensional analysis to develop (dimensionless) valve characteristics and dynamic scale laws. Based on the dimensionless valve characteristics, models for undamped and damped <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> are developed and implemented in the waterhammer computer code CVWP (<b>Check</b> <b>Valve</b> Waterhammer Program). Experiments are performed in the test facility at Delft Hydraulics to measure several valve characteristics of weakly and strongly damped <b>check</b> <b>valves.</b> The dynamic scale laws are validated by means of numerical simulations.

The effectiveness of the surge protection is shown to depend on hydraulics and topology of the line (particularly the position of the high point), on the position of the <b>check</b> <b>valve,</b> and on both the hydraulic and mechanical properties of the <b>check</b> <b>valve.</b> Although the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> only protects the lower (normally upstream) portion of the line from the return surge, the transient response of the remainder of the line can sometimes be improved through installing either a bypass around the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> or by perforating the <b>check</b> <b>valve’s</b> working element. The role and function of any pressure-relieving function at the valve is also numerically investigated and is shown to be a compromise between upstream and downstream protection. Bryan W.
