40|$|For a {{physical}} field theory, the tree-level amplitudes should possess only <b>single</b> <b>poles.</b> However, when computing amplitudes with Cachazo-He-Yuan (CHY) formulation, individual {{terms in the}} intermediate steps will contribute higher-order poles. In this paper, we investigate the cancelation of higher-order poles in CHY formula with Pfaffian as the building block. We develop a diagrammatic rule for expanding the reduced Pfaffian. Then by organizing diagrams in appropriate groups and applying the cross-ratio identities, we show that all potential contributions to higher-order poles in the reduced Pfaffian are canceled out, i. e., only <b>single</b> <b>poles</b> survive in Yang-Mills theory and gravity. Furthermore, we show the cancelations of higher-order poles in other field theories by introducing appropriate truncations, based on the <b>single</b> <b>pole</b> structure of Pfaffian.
