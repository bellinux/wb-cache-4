40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to study the effects of <b>social</b> {{instability}} (<b>regrouping)</b> during the second trimester (7 weeks) of pregnancy on aggression, cortisol concentrations and growth in goats and its consequences for survival, growth and some aspects of behavioural development in the kids. Six weeks after mating, 32 goats were distributed into eight groups. In four of the groups, randomly chosen pairs of goats were rotated between groups every Monday morning (around 08 : 30 h) for 7 weeks (unstable groups), starting 6 weeks into gestation (second trimester). The remaining four groups were kept stable throughout the entire pregnancy (stable groups). The adult goats were video recorded for 6 h twice a week for the first, second, fourth and seventh regrouping and for the 2 last weeks before expected birth. Blood samples of the adult goats were collected in a period from I week before the start of the first regrouping and until I week before expected birth. Blood samples from a maximum of two kids from each litter were collected at 3 weeks of age. Two kids from each litter were subjected to two types of behavioural tests: a 'social test' at the age of 1 and 7 weeks and a 'novel object test' at the age of 5 weeks. Except for the higher aggression level in the unstable groups, social instability did not have any other significant effects on factors such as growth, cortisol level or kid production in the goats. There were only minor effects on the behavioural development in the goat kids. However, kids from the unstable groups showed more escape attempts in the first trial of a,social test', spent more time in contact with a novel object and unfamiliar kids, and showed less fear (escape attempts) after they were given one exposure to the social test situation. Furthermore, kids from unstable groups had a lower basal cortisol level than kids from stable groups. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|After {{more than}} two decades of ongoing violent conflict, armed groups—however {{fleeting}} their existence—have become an integral feature of the eastern Congo’s social-political order. They are not a temporary aberration in what is otherwise a normal society. They {{are at the heart of}} the way power is exercised and experienced. Moreover, armed groups do not stand apart from either society or the state apparatus. They are deeply embedded in <b>social</b> networks that <b>regroup</b> state and non-state actors and that stretch from the very local to the national and sometimes the sub-regional (Great Lakes area) and international levels. This report analyses the stability, inclusivity and levels of violence of both the political settlement of the Congo as a whole and of political settlements in the conflict-ridden east. It shows that in each of these political arenas, armed groups and violence play a different role, and examines how these arenas mutually influence each other. The relative importance of armed groups as either resources or threats to the power of the presidential patronage network shapes its policies towards the east, such as initiatives for military operations or negotiations. These policies influence the role that armed groups play locally. This role, in turn, shapes to what extent and how national politicians engage with armed groups; for instance, whether they support their mobilization or demobilization...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} early {{handling}} on play behaviour, faecal corticosteroid metabolite concentrations and <b>social</b> interactions during <b>regrouping</b> was studied in 40 Holstein Friesian group housed dairy calves. Calves {{were exposed to}} either positive (handler speaking quietly and using pats, n= 20) or negative (pushing the animals and using harsh voices, n= 20) handling for five minutes, twice a day, for five weeks (1 - 5 weeks of age). Fresh faecal samples were collected daily from each group for corticosteroid metabolite analysis. Play behaviour was video recorded for 30 minutes, once a week, for five weeks. There were no differences {{in the frequency of}} any play behaviour between the positive and negative treatments (mean values; positive: 2. 5 events/animal/ 30 minutes, negative: 3. 1 events/animal/ 30 minutes, P {{greater than or equal to}} 0. 122). Play running increased by 12 seconds between weeks one and two (SED: 2. 0, P= 0. 000) and decreased by 11 seconds between weeks four and five (SED: 2. 0, P= 0. 022) when treatment groups were combined. The negative groups tended to have higher maximum concentrations of corticosteroid metabolites (positive: 77 ng/g, negative: 148 ng/g, SED: 18. 8, P= 0. 064) during the first week of handling than the positives (two groups/treatment). In a follow up study conducted at nine months of age, the initial 40 animals and 20 control animals (i. e. animals that received normal on-farm handling) of the same age were assessed on their fearfulness of humans (avoidance test, and latency to approach a food container with and without a handler present), and their <b>social</b> behaviour during <b>regrouping,</b> focussing on aggression. There were no treatment differences in the latency to approach the food container (latency to approach container with and without handler, positive: 21 seconds, negative: 22 seconds, control: 23 seconds, SED: 4. 0, P= 0. 365) and avoidance test scores (positive: 1. 3, negative: 1. 2, control: 0. 9, SED: 0. 26, P= 0. 528); nor were there any differences in behaviours exhibited during regrouping (eating: 11, 10, 10 No/animal/ 15 minutes, SED : 1. 3, P= 0. 680, head to head duration greater than 1 second: 0. 7, 0. 6, 0. 3 No/animal/ 15 minutes SED: 0. 14, P= 0. 630, agonistic behaviours: 1. 4, 1. 6, 2. 2 No/animal/ 15 minutes, SED: 0. 42, P= 0. 290, for positive, negative and control, respectively). Unfamiliar animals performed more head to head behaviours (duration greater than 1 second; familiar: 0. 44 No/animal/ 15 minutes, unfamiliar: 0. 94 No/animal/ 15 minutes, SED: 0. 18, P= 0. 049) than familiar animals (positive, negative and control). In conclusion, early handling had no effect on play behaviour in dairy calves; however negatively handled calves tended to have higher faecal corticosteroid metabolites. Also there were no detectable differences in calves‟ fearfulness of humans or social behaviours at nine months of age; however positively and negatively handled animals showed less avoidance behaviours and performed fewer aggressions compared to animals that received minimal handling (control and unfamiliar: trend only). These results could have been influenced by the animals habituating to the negative handling or the length of time between handling application (one to five weeks of age) and social behaviour testing (nine months of age). However, further research is needed to determine how the amount of handling received at an early age influences fearfulness, play and social interactions in calves...|$|R
40|$|Background: Like other farm animals, {{domestic}} goats may react adversely to unfamiliar individuals, {{and aggression}} can be minimized by avoiding {{the introduction of}} new individuals into established groups. In modern dairy herds, regrouping according to age, nutrient requirements, lactation period and milk yield level is a common management practice to enhance productivity. However, as a result of vigorous fighting associated with the establishment of a new social hierarchy, this practice may temporally disturb the social structure of the herd. High levels of chasing, ghting and displacement from resources may indicate social stress in a group of animals. Possible consequences are a lower access to food, water and attractive resting areas and reduced resting time. This might result in a lower feed intake and a lower growth, suppressed immune response, reduced milk yield and lower reproductive success. The aim {{of the present study was}} to examine the effects of <b>social</b> instability (<b>regrouping)</b> and its consequences in the milk production of Saanen goats. Materials, Methods & Results: In a confined dairy system production, 12 lactating Saanen goats were previously kept together for three weeks in a stable social group. Three female animals were randomly chosen and kept out from the group and put together with three other females, thus creating an unstable social group. Within eight hours from the time when the goats were regrouped, the goats were observed at intervals of ten minutes with regard to agonistic behavior (nuzzling/exploring other goats; frontal clashing or headbutting, or headbutting the shoulders of another goat; headbutting towards other parts of the its body; chasing another goat which tries to escape; threatening behavior; avoidance; withdrawal; active displacement; passive displacement). This observation was repeated one week later. The evening production of milk was measured in the same period. It was observed that the activities of aggression decreased (to 28. 1 % from 25 %) and indifference increased (to 52. 7 % from 66. 8 %) day by day; nevertheless milk production presented a continued decrease (53. 3 %) over the observation period. Discussion: Having knowledge of animal behavior is beneficial, because it can improve the production activity in which the animals will be used. Temperament is positively associated with some characteristics of production. Regrouping is a factor that causes high levels of aggression and decreased production due to a reduction in food consumption. The level of aggression is enhanced and much higher in unstable groups. Similarly to what has been documented in previous studies both on goats and cattle, the animals do not seem to adapt to regrouping, as the aggression level remains almost constant at every regrouping. Therefore, meeting new group members will most certainly be associated with an increased aggression level. It has been documented in several animal species that the intensive aggressive interactions that occur between unfamiliar individuals will affect access to important resources, reduce food intake and growth, lower the immune response, reduce milk yield and lower the reproductive success. Nonetheless, some authors found negative effects on the milk yield of goats which were regrouped for the rst time, but milk yield was no longer affected at the second and third regrouping. This may suggest that somehow goats become adapted to a situation of social stress, at least until the production level is no longer inuenced. In this study, the mixing of dairy goats in the same group caused disorder in the social balance of the same, which was reflected in milk production...|$|R
40|$|Former {{experiments}} {{have shown that}} social experience during nursing in either a group housing system with straw or a very spacious farrowing/nursing pen with straw, increases social skills of growing pigs considerably. Based on experiences in Taiwan, it was postulated that such skills could also be acquired in the period between being taken from flatdecks at 10 weeks of age {{and the age of}} 5 months. In an ‘arena’, copied from the one used for introducing new pigs (gilts) in a group housing system, agonistic behaviour and number and severity of lesions of the integument of 384 experimental GY x DUROC hybrid gilts were studied and compared with data of an equal number of control gilts in three different treatments (repeated once). The experimental animals were born in individual farrowing crates with slatted floors. They were weaned at 30 days and kept in flatdeck cages with two other litters, until 10 weeks. At that time they were kept in groups of eight on fully slatted floors and treated with regrouping and repenning several times until the final testing at an age of 5 months. In sequential experiments, this treatment was given twice, three times or four times and effects on social (agonistic) behaviour were studied. The control animals were born in a group farrowing house with straw, where they stayed 30 days (some days after weaning). As for the experimental pigs, two litters were grouped in flatdeck cages. At 10 weeks of age they were moved to pens with fully slatted floors, where they remained in groups of eight undisturbed until final testing at 5 months. At an age of five months, eight unfamiliar experimental animals were grouped in a so-called arena for 24 h. So were 8 control pigs in the same week. Time-lapse video observations during these 24 h (2 frames/s) revealed that the pigs were fighting for social dominance during this period. Experimental pigs that had been regrouped four times only showed 57 % of bilateral agonistic actions and 82 % of total fighting time, in comparison with control pigs. Three times regrouping still showed a statistically significant lower amount of fighting, but twice regrouping did not. After 24 h in the arena, the number of lesions of the integument was significantly smaller in groups that had experienced regrouping 3 or 4 times. These results proved that <b>social</b> experience by <b>regrouping</b> and repenning prepared gilts for agonistic encounters, by improving their social skills...|$|R
