The energy carried by a single electron - its self-energy - is not simply the bare value, but also includes the energy contained in its electromagnetic field, its attendant cloud of photons. The energy in a field of a <b>spherical</b> <b>source</b> diverges in both classical and quantum mechanics, but as discovered by Weisskopf with help from Furry, in quantum mechanics the divergence is much milder, going only as the logarithm of the radius of the sphere.|$|E

30|$|Our GNSS {{analysis}} {{detected the}} inflation {{of a deep}} <b>spherical</b> <b>source</b> in late March 2015, well {{before the onset of}} the seismic swarm activity in late April. It {{is interesting to note that}} a deep low-frequency event (DLF) began at approximately the same time as the inflation (Yukutake and Abe 2018; Mannen et al. 2018). However, the DLF occurred at 15 – 30  km depth, much deeper than the deep <b>spherical</b> <b>source</b> at 5 – 6  km depth (see Fig.  3). Yukutake and Abe (2018) hypothesized that the DLF event may be due to an increase in magmatic fluid pressure. This suggests that such fluid may have migrated to shallower depths, potentially generating inflation of the deep <b>spherical</b> <b>source</b> discussed here.|$|E

In contrast, MRI and JMA (2007) and Ishikawa (2008) used data including near-field observations for their modeling.

40|$|Abstract Background The bioluminescent enzyme firefly {{luciferase}} (Luc) or {{variants of}} {{green fluorescent protein}} (GFP) in transformed cells can be effectively used to reveal molecular and cellular features of neoplasia in vivo. Tumor cell growth and regression in response to various therapies can be evaluated by using bioluminescent imaging. In bioluminescent imaging, light propagates in highly scattering tissue, and the diffusion approximation is sufficiently accurate to predict the imaging signal around the biological tissue. The numerical solutions to the diffusion equation take large amounts of computational time, and the studies for its analytic solutions have attracted more attention in biomedical engineering applications. Methods Biological tissue is a turbid medium that both scatters and absorbs photons. An accurate model for the propagation of photons through tissue can be adopted from transport theory, and its diffusion approximation is applied to predict the imaging signal around the biological tissue. The solution to the diffusion equation is formulated by the convolution between its Green's function and source term. The formulation of photon diffusion from <b>spherical</b> bioluminescent <b>sources</b> in an infinite homogeneous medium can be obtained to accelerate the forward simulation of bioluminescent phenomena. Results The closed form solutions have been derived for the time-dependent diffusion equation and the steady-state diffusion equation with solid and hollow <b>spherical</b> <b>sources</b> in a homogeneous medium, respectively. Meanwhile, the relationship between solutions with a solid sphere source and ones with a surface sphere source is obtained. Conclusion We have formulated solutions for the diffusion equation with solid and hollow <b>spherical</b> <b>sources</b> in an infinite homogeneous medium. These solutions have been verified by Monte Carlo simulation for use in biomedical optical imaging studies. The closed form solution is highly accurate and more computationally efficient in biomedical engineering applications. By using our analytic solutions for <b>spherical</b> <b>sources,</b> we can better predict bioluminescent signals and better understand both the potential for, and the limitations of, bioluminescent tomography in an idealized case. The formulas are particularly valuable for furthering the development of bioluminescent tomography. </p...|$|R

Excellent agreement (less than 0. 7 % difference) was achieved when comparing reference solutions with PENTRAN scalar fluxes {{in the case of}} planar, shell and solid sphere sources.

40|$|The dynamic {{response}} of an elastic half-space {{due to a}} buried <b>spherical</b> <b>source</b> is investigated for points {{on the surface of}} the half-space. An analytical model for the <b>spherical</b> <b>source</b> is obtained by modifying the point source theory of de Hoop for a source pressure function of the form P(t) = pot " exp (-at). However, since any point source cannot involve reflections from the source itself, our model is only an approximation to the real case which must involve reflections from the boundary of the <b>spherical</b> <b>source</b> itself. The present treatment is also cast in a scale-independent form in order to generalize the application. A comparison of our analytical model with the results of dynamic finite-element modelling (DFEM) shows excellent agreement for deep sources. However, for near-surface sources the tails of the waveforms are quite different, although the agreement for the peak amplitudes is good. This waveform discrepancy is due to reflection from the boundary of the <b>spherical</b> <b>source</b> itself; this boundary is naturally present in the DFEM solution. Furthermore, if reflections from the source boundary are neglected, the displace-ment directly above a near-surface source is, to a good approximation, directly proportional to the source pressure function. On the other hand, the displacement directly above a deep source is, to a good approximation, directly proportional to the first derivative of the source pressure function.

Assuming a <b>spherical</b> heat <b>source</b> at a depth of 240 m with a volume of 1. 15 × 107 m 3 and a temperature step 103 K, the predicted rate of post-eruptive ground movement agrees with the observed rate within observational errors.

In the Shinmoe-dake eruptions, the suitable procedure for source determination described above and the fact that tilt change trends recorded by each station and the ratio of absolute tilt value changes between stations were approximately constant throughout the eruptive events (Ueda et al.

On Sakurajima Island, Japan, uplift was detected on Sakurajima volcano, while around the Aira Caldera, deformation {{in the center of}} the caldera can be explained by the inflation of a <b>spherical</b> <b>source</b> (Yamamoto et al. 2013). Yamamoto et al. (2013) used this data to suggest the imminent potential of new and intensive eruptive activity at Sakurajima volcano. In the Campi Flegrei caldera, Italy, the geometry and density of a deformation source has been estimated from leveling, electronic distance measurement (EDM), and gravity surveys. The estimated density of the source was considered to be almost the same as that of water, unambiguously suggesting the presence of geothermal fluid (Battaglia et al. 2006). At the Tatun Volcano Group, Taiwan, a shallow <b>spherical</b> <b>source</b> was proposed as a plausible model to explain small uplift in a fumarolic area, and the imminent potential of phreatic activity was also suggested (Murase et al. 2014).|$|E

The deformation pattern for the August 2015 event, however, is not suitable for applying the Mogi model. The horizontal displacements do not indicate a radial expansion, but a WNW–ESE extension, which is approximated by a nearly vertical dike with a NNE–SSW strike.
