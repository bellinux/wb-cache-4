40|$|We {{study the}} {{stability}} of conductance oscillations in monatomic <b>sodium</b> <b>wires</b> with respect to structural variations. The geometry, the electronic structure and the electronic potential of <b>sodium</b> <b>wires</b> suspended between two sodium electrodes are obtained from self-consistent density functional theory calculations. The conductance is calculated {{within the framework of}} the Landauer-Bütttiker formalism, using the mode-matching technique as formulated recently in a real-space finite-difference scheme [Phys. Rev. B 70, 195402 (2004) ]. We find a regular even-odd conductance oscillation as a function of the wire length, where wires comprising an odd number of atoms have a conductance close to the quantum unit G_ 0 =e^ 2 /πħ, and even-numbered wires have a lower conductance. The conductance of odd-numbered wires is stable with respect to geometry changes in the wire or in the contacts between the wire and the electrodes; the conductance of even-numbered wires is more sensitive. Geometry changes affect the spacing and widths of the wire resonances. In the case of odd-numbered wires the transmission is on-resonance, and hardly affected by the resonance shapes, whereas for even-numbered wires the transmission is off-resonance and sensitive to the resonance shapes. Predicting the amplitude of the conductance oscillation requires a first-principles calculation based upon a realistic structure of the wire and the leads. A simple tight-binding model is introduced to clarify these results. Comment: 16 pages, 20 figure...|$|R

50|$|A very {{effective}} way to remove any traces of water from THF is by reflux with <b>sodium</b> <b>wire</b> {{in the presence of}} a small amount of benzophenone. Benzophenone is reduced to the ketyl radical anion by sodium which gives the THF solution an intense blue color. However, any trace of water in THF will further reduce the ketyl to the colourless alcohol. In this way, the color of the THF signals the dryness and the distilled THF contains less than 10 ppm of water. This treatment also effectively removes any peroxides in the THF. Radical anions of this type are also involved in the Acyloin condensation.|$|R

Size-evolutionary {{patterns}} of mechanical and electronic transport properties in junctions are discussed, showing formation of nanowires upon narrowing, regard-less {{of the initial}} dimensions of the junctions.

This thesis "Electronic transport through nanowires: a real-space ¯nite-difference approach" aims at a general theoretical treatment of coherent electronic transport in mesoscopic and mi- croscopic systems by means of Green's function and mode-matching techniques. A general method has been developed for conductance calculations {{on the basis of}} the mode-matching technique within the real-space high-order ¯nite-difference scheme for representing a single electron equation. Testing of this real-space ¯nite-di®erence approach for model systems has been done. This approach in combination with the density-functional formalism has been applied to the conductance calculations in nanowires. The stability of even-odd conductance oscillations in monatomic <b>sodium</b> <b>wires</b> with respect to structural variations has been investigated...|$|R
40|$|RCM is a {{maintenance}} method, {{which comes from}} the airline industry, in the late 1970 's. The method is used to control the maintenance, prevent possible failures and make the maintenance done in an appropriate frequency. To achieve the RCM analysis a RCM team must be created. When implement the RCM method in other customer operational conditions, the method must {{be the same for}} fulfil the SAE maintenance standard. Instead must the implementation process be modificated. This thesis work has been performed at Metso Paper, Service Inc., in Sundsvall. Metso Paper is interested in the RCM process and how it could be used in other customer operational conditions. The purpose with this thesis report was to define what the RCM method is, try to find suggestions of how to implement the RCM method into other customer operational conditions. There was also pilot project done on a twin <b>wire</b> <b>press,</b> to really se how the RCM analysis was performed. The pilot project were limited to five sub-systems of the twin <b>wire</b> <b>press.</b> These sub-system have been gone through a total RCM analysis, {{to the front of the}} audit process. To successfully implement the RCM method into other customer operational conditions and in their maintenance organizations, must a very good understanding about their culture be made. Also must the implementation process be planned clearly, so that the best result will be reached. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

40|$|Background: The laparoscopic {{approach}} to myomectomy has {{raised questions about}} the risk of uterine rupture in patients who become pregnant following surgery. It has been suggested that the rupture outside labor in pregnancies following laparoscopic myomectomy can be due to the difficulty of suturing or to the presence of a hematoma or to the wide use of radiofrequencies. Aim: To assess the outcome of pregnancy following laparoscopic myomectomy. Methods: A literature search performed using engine Google, High <b>wire</b> <b>press,</b> Springer link, and Yahoo. Selected papers screened for other related reports. Results: There were no incidents of uterine scar rupture in any of these studies. Conclusions: Uterine rupture during pregnancies following laparoscopic myomectomy is rare.
