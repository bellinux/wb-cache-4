40|$|The {{organizations}} maintain excessive inventories {{as a way}} {{to anticipate}} the customer's need, taking, this way, competitive advantage. On the other hand, the lack of stocks can <b>stop</b> <b>assembly</b> lines; change the production schedule; increase costs and harm the marketing planning. However, there are costs in relation to these inventories;therefore, set an appropriate policy stock management is a critical factor for the success of a company, in addition to obtaining sustainable competitive advantage in the long term. Considered by many as the basis for managing the supply chain, inventory management depends on clear definitions for the following questions: how much to ask, when to ask, how much to keep in stock and where to find the stock. Therefore, there must be a balance in relation to demand and stock supply. Increased market competitiveness forces companies to lower their stock costs and may result in loss of orders due to lack of product. This paper describes the process of forecasting demand, and the methods of analysis forecasting as a tool to reduce costs by simulating the methods of demand forecasting in order to improve the level of stock. Thus, a case study was elaborated in the ABC Company, which acts in the imported PPE business for analyzing the process and simulating the techniques of demand forecasting. The results presented in the case study were satisfactory actually observed divergence between the process applied before the company and applied studies directly on demand obtained with this assertiveness in the forecast. ...|$|E

40|$|We used {{a series}} of COOH-terminally deleted {{recombinant}} myosin molecules to map precisely the binding sites of 22 monoclonal antibodies along the tail of Acanthamoeba myosin-II. These antibodies bind to 14 distinguishable epitopes, some separated by less than 10 amino acids. The positions of the binding sites visualized by electron microscopy agree only approximately with the physical positions of these sites on the alpha-helical coiled-coil tail. On the other hand, the epitope map agrees precisely with competitive binding studies: all antibodies that share an epitope {{compete with each other}} for binding to myosin. Antibodies with adjacent epitopes can compete with each other at linear distances up to 5 or 6 nm, and many antibodies that bind 3 - 7 - nm apart can enhance the binding of each other to myosin. Most of the antibodies that bind to the distal 37 nm of the tail disrupt assembly of octameric minifilaments and, depending upon the exact location of the binding site, <b>stop</b> <b>assembly</b> at specific steps yielding, for example, monomers, antiparallel dimers, parallel dimers or antiparallel tetramers. The effects of these antibodies on assembly identify sites on the tail that are required for individual steps in minifilament assembly. Experiments on the assembly of truncated myosin-II tails have revealed a complementary group of sites that participate in the assembly reactions (Sinard, J. H., D. L. Rimm, and T. D. Pollard. 1990. J. Cell Biol. 111 : 2417 - 2426). Antibodies that bind to the distal tail but do not affect assembly appear to have a low affinity for myosin-II. Antibodies that bind to the proximal 50 nm of the tail do not inhibit the assembly of minifilaments. Many antibodies that bind to the tail of myosin-II, even some that have no obvious effect on minifilament assembly, can inhibit the actomyosin ATPase activity and the contraction of an actin gel formed in crude extracts. An antibody that binds between amino acids 1447 and 1467 inhibits the phosphorylation of serine residues distal to residue 1483...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{envelope}} of immature vaccinia virions {{consists of a}} lipoprotein bilayer upon which a precise curvature is imposed by acquisition of an external scaffold of spicules. Self-assembly of this tegument was examined employing our ts 6757 mutant, which induces accumulation of immature envelopes at the restrictive temperature. With ts 6757 the envelope bilayers were also assembled into an alternative membrane configuration {{in the form of}} flexible cylinders or tubes of uniform width, lacking the spicule coat. Such tubes became extensions of or were continuous with the spherical virion envelopes. The ∼ 65 kDa spicule protein, L 65, product of gene D 13 L on theHindIII map, generally designated as a late protein, was expressed as an early function in presence of hydroxyurea, an inhibitor which entirely blocked vaccinia DNA synthesis without <b>stopping</b> <b>assembly</b> of immature envelopes. Labeling of thin sections by immunogold for electron microscopy demonstrated that L 65 is present at the surface of immature virions, consistent with the position of spicules on envelopes. Transiency of the spicule scaffold was documented by (a) absence of L 65 from intracellular mature virions (IMV) and (b) rapid turnover of L 65 during ts 6757 virus replication at the permissive temperature but conservation of this protein at restrictive temperature, as demonstrated in pulse–chase experiments. Time-related decrease in MW of L 65 to a smaller polypeptide is interpreted as evidence suggesting that the spicules attached to the envelope are assembled from a higher MW precursor...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} tunicamycin (TM) on the {{development}} of the cell wall in Oocystis solitaria has been investigated. It was found that 10 micromolar TM completely <b>stops</b> the <b>assembly</b> of new microfibrils as observed at the ultrastructural level. During cell wall formation, freeze fracture replicas of the E-face of the plasma membrane reveal two major substructures: the terminal complexes (TC), paired and unpaired, and the microfibril imprints extending from unpaired TCs. In cells treated for 3 hours or longer with TM, the TCs are no longer visible, whereas microfibril imprints are still present. Because of the reported highly selective mode of action of TM, our results implicate a role for lipid-intermediates in cellulose synthesis in O. solitaria. It is assumed that TM prevents the formation of a glycoprotein which probably is a fundamental part of the TCs and may act as a primer for the assembly of the microfibrils...|$|R
