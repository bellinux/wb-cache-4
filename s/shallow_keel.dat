50|$|The Nordland boat has a clinker, or lapstrake hull {{design and}} has its rudder on the sternpost. Its length varies from the {{smallest}} of fourteen feet to well over forty and usually has a length-beam ratio of 3-1 to 4-1. It has a high prow, stern, <b>shallow</b> <b>keel,</b> v-hull and has an inboard gunwale, {{which can be used}} to drain off the fishing nets when they are drawn on board. Some of the larger Nordlanders have a detachable cabin that is used for shelter, often having a wood burning stove inside.|$|E
5000|$|Australia is a {{conventional}} design {{and has been}} described as a [...] "Courageous-style boat". It has v-shaped mid-ship sections, a low freeboard, large bustle and a low aft run finishing in a wide U-shaped transom. Its fore overhang is very narrow and round shaped in its lowest part. The cockpits are <b>shallow,</b> <b>keel</b> is thin and the ballast is placed very low. The elliptical mast is made in extruded aluminium. Australia was approximately 1500 kg lighter than Courageous and it was hoped that by lowering the freeboard and taking a penalty on length, Australia would prove faster than the US boat.|$|E
5000|$|Original Bermuda Dinghies were roundbottomed {{and fitted}} with long, <b>shallow</b> <b>keels</b> {{so they would}} be easy to beach or could run over reefs without damage. During the first {{recorded}} race, held in St. George's Harbour in 1853, the existing boats were fitted with deep keel extensions fastened in place temporarily to give them the bite to sail better to windward. These metal keels (called fans) differentiated these racing boats from the [...] "unfitted" [...] working dinghies and gave the class its name.|$|R

5000|$|... #Caption: Reconstruction of a Roman fluvial boat of the classis germanica (Rhine flotilla). It {{is based}} on the {{remarkable}} discovery of the remains of five Roman boats at Mainz in the early 1980s. The boat above, denoted Mainz Type A, was designed as a rapid intervention launch, with long, narrow shape and <b>shallow</b> <b>keel.</b> It would be rowed by the troops themselves (32 oars, 16 on each side). Note the mounted shields to protect the oarsmen from missiles shot from the riverbanks. At the time of Civilis' revolt (69 AD), most such boats were manned by Batavi crews. 4th century.

50|$|The Manuel Primary was {{a wooden}} {{aircraft}} built around an open, vertical, tapered girder with a horizontal upper member {{and a lower}} one shaped at the front into a <b>shallow</b> <b>keel.</b> The girder was strengthened {{with a series of}} vertical and diagonal cross-pieces. The keel projected forward of the foremost vertical member and carried the pilot's seat on its upper edge. The thick-profile wing was attached to {{the upper part of the}} girder and was straight edged with constant chord apart from the angled tips of the ailerons. Extensions of two of the forward girder cross-pieces formed a triangular structure over the wing which acted as a king post for a pair of landing wires. Flying wires from the keel and the upper member about half way to the rear of the girder carried the lifting loads on the wing. There were also bracing wires from wing to the rear of the aircraft to restrain horizontal bending of the girder. The rectangular tailplane was likewise fixed to the top of the girder and carried elevators with a cut-out in which the all-moving rectangular rudder, which extended to the lower girder, could operate.|$|E
50|$|The {{efficiency}} of a centreboard improves with increasing aspect ratio. A long narrow centreboard produces less drag than a short, wide {{one for a}} given amount of lift, resulting in a faster boat that can point closer into the wind. A fore and aft, pivoting centreboard {{can also be used}} to move the centre of lateral resistance aft to match a change in sail plan, such as furling or dropping the jib. A retracting centreboard is more complex than a fixed keel, and most take up space inside the hull of the boat that could otherwise be used for passenger accommodation. Other types feature a casing under the boat, which does not take up space but instead has the problem of increased drag. For this reason, it is not uncommon to find boats with a combination of <b>shallow</b> <b>keel</b> and centreboard (e.g. Randmeer). The keel provides the housing for the centreboard, moving it out of the hull, but adds only a small amount of draft to the boat. The centreboard can then be lowered in deeper waters to increase the amount of lift. Ballast is usually provided in the keel, keeping the centreboard lighter and easier to handle.|$|E
50|$|The DS-16 {{is a small}} {{recreational}} keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, {{with wood}} trim. It has a fractional sloop rig, a transom-hung rudder and a fixed <b>shallow</b> draft <b>keel</b> or optionally a centreboard. It displaces 500 lb and carries 135 lb of ballast.|$|R
50|$|Hyphalosaurus {{was covered}} mostly in small, irregularly {{patterned}} polygonal scales, though these varied across the body. The {{scales of the}} hind legs were smaller, finer and more irregular {{than those of the}} torso, while the scales of the tail were nearly square and arranged in more regular rows. In addition to the small scales, two rows of large, round scutes with <b>shallow</b> <b>keels</b> ran along the animals sides. One row ran directly along the flank, with the other either slightly higher or lower and composed of scutes only 1/4 the size of the flank scutes. The flank row of larger scutes extended {{all the way to the}} base of the tail, and remained uniform in size across the entire row.|$|R

5000|$|The caravel was {{developed}} in about 1451, based on existing fishing boats under the sponsorship of Henry the Navigator of Portugal, and soon became the preferred vessel for Portuguese explorers like Diogo Cão, Bartolomeu Dias or Gaspar and Miguel Corte-Real, and by Christopher Columbus. Its name may derive from an ancient boat type known as carabus in Latin and [...] in Greek, later adopted into Arabic as qārib, indicating some continuity of its carvel build through the ages. They were agile and easier to navigate than the barca and barinel, with a tonnage of 50 to 160 tons and 1 to 3 masts, with lateen triangular sails allowing beating.Being smaller and having a <b>shallow</b> <b>keel,</b> the caravel could sail upriver in shallow coastal waters. With the lateen sails attached, it was highly maneuverable and could sail much nearer the shore, while with the square Atlantic-type sails attached, it was very fast. Its economy, speed, agility, and power made it esteemed as the best sailing vessel of its time. The limited capacity for cargo and crew were their main drawbacks, but did not hinder its success.|$|E
50|$|The design had {{a choice}} of keels. There was an option of a {{standard}} keel with a draft of 6.50 ft and 6000 lb of lead ballast, a <b>shallow</b> draft <b>keel</b> with a draft of 6.00 ft and 6200 lb of lead ballast and a deep keel with a draft of 8.00 ft and 5500 lb of lead ballast.|$|R
50|$|A keelboat is a {{riverine}} cargo-capable working boat, or a small- to mid-sized recreational sailing yacht. The {{boats in}} the first category have <b>shallow</b> structural <b>keels,</b> and are nearly flat-bottomed and often used leeboards if forced in open water, while modern recreational keelboats have prominent fixed fin keels, and considerable draft. The two terms may draw from cognate words with different final meaning.|$|R
5000|$|Epidendrum alpicolum is a {{sympodial}} epiphyte with slender, flattened stems, to 0.6 m tall. The stems {{are covered}} by tubular sheathes, which bear leaves on {{the upper part of}} the stem. The distichous linear-lanceolate leaves are often bilobulate at the apex. [...] The cylindrical, racemose, many-flowered inflorescence erupts from a solitary spathe (sometimes twin spathes) at the apex of the stem, as is typical of the subgenus E. subg. Spathium [...] The lanceolate-acuminate sepals are wedge shaped at the base: the dorsal 7-12 mm long by as little as 2 mm wide; the laeral sepals slightly larger and asymmetrical at the base. The linear petals are much shorter than the petals. The trilobulate lip is adnate to the column to its apex: cordate at the base, with minute crenulations on the lateral lobes, two calosities at the base, and three or more <b>shallow</b> <b>keels</b> running down the midlobe from near the column apex.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} ice keels {{on the upper}} ocean are {{examined}} {{using a combination of}} turbulence measurements and output from a large-eddy simulation (LES) model. Two cases are examined, one during the winter when the under-ice boundary layer is relatively deep (20 m) and near the freezing point and a second during the summer when the ice is melting and the boundary layer consists of a shallow (0. 5 m), highly stratified fresh layer. In the winter case, measurements show that flow disruption by a 10 -m-deep keel causes enhanced vertical mixing, increasing the heat flux from a background value of 5 W m^(- 2) to values averaging 25 W m^(- 2). Simulations using the LES model are in good agreement with the measurements and indicate that the keel generates a turbulent wake region extending hundreds of meters downstream from the keel. Elevated heat fluxes in the wake region are generated by increased entrainment of warmer water from beneath the mixed layer. Simulations of summer cases demonstrate that <b>shallow</b> <b>keels</b> (0. 5 m) generate strong turbulence that is able to rapidly mix the fresh layer in the lee of keels. However, this effect decreases quickly as the fresh layer accelerates to match the ice velocity. Deeper keels (1 m) follow a similar pattern but generate more mixing as the fresh layer is forced under the keel. Simulated ice melt heat fluxes are similar to estimates made from ice balance measurements taken during the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean summer field program...|$|R

40|$|The present thesis {{explored}} sea ice ridges in the Fram Strait {{from data}} collected at 79 degrees N, 65 degrees W in 2006 / 2007 by an Upward Looking Sonar instrument, IPS 4, and used extreme value analysis {{to provide an}} estimate of how deep sea ice ridges could be in this area, and its return period. Ice in the Fram Strait originate from different regions in the Arctic Ocean and is therefore representative of the ice ridge distribution in the Arctic. Ice ridges were identified using the Rayleigh method, choosing a threshold value of 2. 5 m and a minimum draft value of 5 m. The mean keel draft value {{was found to be}} 7. 7 m. The <b>shallowest</b> <b>keel</b> observed had a draft of 5. 0 m, while the deepest keel was 24. 97 m deep. Extreme value analysis was performed on the data collected to find estimates of extreme values of ice ridge keel draft, and its 100 -year return level. The shape parameter in the Generalized Pareto distribution was estimated to be close to zero, which qualified for a reduction to the Exponential distribution. The 100 -year return level was estimated to be in the range of 37 &# 150; 45 m with the Generalized Pareto distribution and the Exponential distribution. The Weibull distribution was also used in the same analysis, but gave a much lower result with a 100 -year return level of 29 m. The fraction of ice observed defined as ice ridges was 3 %. The probability of encountering ice ridges deeper than 20 m was 0. 15 m, corresponding to previous results from similar analysis. </p...|$|R

50|$|From an {{offshore}} engineering and naval perspective, {{there are three}} reasons why pressure ridges are a subject of investigation. Firstly, because the highest loads applied on offshore structures operating in cold oceans by drift ice are associated with these features. Secondly, when pressure ridges drift into <b>shallower</b> areas, their <b>keel</b> may {{come into contact with}} the seabed, thereby representing a risk for subsea pipelines (see Seabed gouging by ice) and other seabed installations. Thirdly, they {{have a significant impact on}} navigation. In the Arctic, ridged ice makes up about 40% of the overall mass of sea ice.|$|R
5|$|Apart {{from the}} skull, the {{skeleton}} of Istiodactylus was {{similar to those of}} other ornithocheiroid pterosaurs. The vertebral column, forelimb, and trunk bones were pneumatised by air sacs. The neural arches of the vertebrae had tall, sloping laminae. The notarium (a structure consisting of fused vertebrae in the shoulder-region of some pterosaurs and birds) consisted of six fused trunk vertebrae, with their neural spines fused into a plate, on which the shoulder blades articulated with a depression on each side. The main part of the sternum was very deep, with a bowed front edge and a <b>shallow,</b> triangular <b>keel.</b> The facets of the sternum that contacted with the coracoids were saddle-shaped and arranged asymmetrically. The humerus (upper arm bone) was stout and had a sharply curved deltopectoral crest. The forelimbs of istiodactylids were large, up to 4.5 times longer than their legs. The long wing-finger may have occupied 50 percent of the wing-skeleton. The hindlimbs were short compared to the forelimbs, and the feet were as long as the small third finger.|$|R
50|$|Bilge keels {{are often}} fitted to smaller sailing yachts. Bilge keels {{minimise}} {{the draft of}} the vessel compared to a single fin keel thus enabling it to negotiate <b>shallower</b> water. Bilge <b>keels</b> on sailing yachts extend below the lowest point of the hull extending slightly outwards. Such an arrangement also enables the vessel to stand upright on firm sand or mud at drying moorings {{without the need for}} detachable legs, and is simpler than retractable fin keels while giving the hull greater protection. Bilge keels are not as effective as central fin keels in preventing leeway (sideways slippage) caused by crosswinds but are preferred by many small craft owners due to their other advantages.|$|R
50|$|In sailboats, keels use {{the forward}} {{motion of the}} boat to {{generate}} lift to counteract the leeward force of the wind. The rudimentary purpose of the keel is to convert the sideways motion of the wind when it is abeam into forward motion. A secondary purpose of the keel is to provide ballast.Keels are different from centreboards {{and other types of}} foils in that keels are made of heavy materials to provide ballast to stabilize the boat. Keels may be fixed, or non-movable, or they may retract to allow sailing in <b>shallower</b> waters. Retracting <b>keels</b> may pivot (a swing keel) or slide upwards to retract, and are usually retracted with a winch due to the weight of the ballast. Since the keel provides far more stability when lowered than when retracted (due to the greater moment arm involved), the amount of sail carried is generally reduced when sailing with the keel retracted.|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{developed}} for predicting the forces and moments {{acting on a}} vessel due to the hydrodynamic interactions between Vessels in a passing situation. The lateral separation between the vessels is assumed large so that the vessels are in each other's far field. The speed of the interacting vessels is small so that the free surface effects are neglected. The water depth is assumed small so that the ship {{is close to the}} bottom. Two cases are investigated, namely, the case when the ship touches the bottom (two dimensional problem), and the case when there is a slight gap beneath the <b>keel</b> (<b>shallow</b> water problem. &&The general problem is solved using the method of matched asymptotic expansions. In the far field, the body and vorticity in the unsteady wake region are represented by a distribution of sources and vortices. As typical of slender body theories, the source strength can be directly related to the body geometry. The vorticity must be determined by the solution of a pair of coupled singular integral equations. The integral equations are solved by a successive approximation scheme. The side forces and yaw moments are calculated using the source and Vortex strengths. &&Numerical results are presented. Due to the lack of experimental data, comparison with experimental results are made for the two dimensional problem only. Qualitative agreements between the numerical and experimental results are indicated...|$|R
