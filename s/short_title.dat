5|$|The above {{procedures}} {{are not sufficient}} to cause an Act of Tynwald to come into full force of law. By ancient custom, an Act did not come into force until it had been promulgated at an open-air sitting of the Tynwald, historically held on Tynwald Hill at St John's on St John's Day (24 June), but, since {{the adoption of the}} Gregorian calendar in 1753, on 5 July (or on the following Monday if 5 July is a Saturday or Sunday). Promulgation originally consisted of the reading of the Act in English and Manx; but after 1865 the reading of the title of the Act and a summary of each section was sufficient. This was reduced in 1895 to the titles and a memorandum of the object and purport of the Act, and since 1988 only the <b>short</b> <b>title</b> and a summary of the long title have been read.|$|E

25|$|Oroonoko {{was not a}} very {{substantial}} success at first. The stand-alone edition, according to the English <b>Short</b> <b>Title</b> Catalog online, was not followed by a new edition until 1696. Behn, who had hoped to recoup a significant amount of money from the book, was disappointed. Sales picked up in the second year after her death, and the novel then went through three printings. The story was used by Thomas Southerne for a tragedy entitled Oroonoko: A Tragedy. Southerne's play was staged in 1695 and published in 1696, with a foreword in which Southerne expresses his gratitude to Behn and praises her work. The play was a great success. After the play was staged, a new edition of the novel appeared, and it was never out of print in the 18th century afterward. The adaptation is generally faithful to the novel, with one significant exception: it makes Imoinda white instead of black (see Macdonald), and therefore, like Othello, the male lead would perform in blackface to a white heroine. As the taste of the 1690s demanded, Southerne emphasises scenes of pathos, especially those involving the tragic heroine, such as the scene where Oroonoko kills Imoinda. At the same time, in standard Restoration theatre rollercoaster manner, the play intersperses these scenes with a comic and sexually explicit subplot. The subplot was soon cut from stage representations with the changing taste of the 18th century, but the tragic tale of Oroonoko and Imoinda remained popular on the stage.|$|E

40|$|Many {{of those}} close to the Congressional {{legislative}} process seem to view the <b>short</b> <b>titles</b> of bills as “branding” rather than official legal instruments. In fact, this {{may be one of}} the reasons that some <b>short</b> <b>titles</b> for bills and laws have become tendentious and overly aspirational. This is problematic for such titles, as they are formally recognized by their inscription into federal law, and thus transcend their “branding” purposes, thereby putting the legal status of <b>short</b> <b>titles</b> in an awkward juxtaposition. By stripping away all of the current legal barriers that would technically negate such a prospect, this Article considers whether contemporary <b>short</b> bills <b>titles</b> would pass the U. S. Federal Trade Commission’s (“FTC”) deceptive practice scrutiny. Relying on three main pieces of evidence (the FTC Policy Statement on Deception, the FTC Enforcement Policy Statement on Food Advertising, and the landmark Kraft, Inc. v.

Notable parody inspirations included Masterchef, Wife Swap, Come Dine with Me and The Apprentice.

500|$|So is Gabriel's first non-eponymous album. Gabriel {{has noted}} his dislike for titling albums, mainly because it distracts from the sleeve design. In an {{interview}} for Rolling Stone, he explained that his American label Geffen Records refused to release Peter Gabriel IV until it was retitled Security. He elaborated that for So [...] " [...] {{decided to go for}} the anti-title... It can be more a piece of graphic, if you like, as opposed to something with meaning and intention. And that's what I've done ever since". When the album was profiled in the Classic Albums documentary series, Gabriel quipped that its <b>short</b> <b>title</b> meant it could be enlarged and useful when marketing it. Before the album was eventually named So, {{it was meant to be}} entitled Good. The sleeve design is a portrait of Gabriel photographed by Trevor Key, who was then most famous for capturing the bell artwork for Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells (1973). It was then designed by Peter Saville and Brett Wickens; Saville was most known for designing several sleeves for Factory Records artists. Saville was paid £20,000 for his design. Gabriel has since commented: [...] "the only compromise I made was to go with Peter Saville's idea for a retro-style portrait. I was told my usual obscure LP sleeves alienated women." ...|$|E
