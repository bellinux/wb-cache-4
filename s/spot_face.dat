5000|$|The {{title is}} a single-player {{platformer}} {{in which the}} player controls Cool Spot. Cool Spot can jump and can attack by throwing soda bubbles in any direction. Cool Spot can also cling to and climb various things by jumping {{up in front of}} them. In each level the player must rescue other cool spots, who look exactly alike, from their cages. In order to do so, the player is required to collect a certain number of [...] "spots" [...] that changes (usually increasing) as the game progresses. [...] "Spots" [...] are placed around the level in large quantities. The player's health is monitored by a humorous Cool <b>Spot</b> <b>face</b> that gradually bends forward and eventually falls from its position as damage occurs. Damage is taken by touching enemies and their projectiles and certain other obstacles. There is also a time limit for each level. The game has no save feature but does include checkpoints in the form of flagpoles.|$|E
5000|$|A {{spotface}} or <b>spot</b> <b>face</b> is a machined {{feature in}} which a certain region of the workpiece (a spot) is faced, providing a smooth, flat, accurately located surface. This is especially relevant on workpieces cast or forged, where the spotface's smooth, flat, accurately located surface stands in distinction to the surrounding surface whose roughness, flatness, and location are subject to wider tolerances and thus not assured with a machining level of precision. The most common application of spotfacing (spot facing) is facing the area around a bolt hole where the bolt's head will sit, which is often done by cutting a shallow counterbore, just deep enough [...] "to clean up"—that is, only enough material is removed to get down past any irregularity and thus make the surface flat. Other common applications of spotfacing involve facing a pad onto a boss, creating planar surfaces in known locations that can orient a casting or forging into position in the assembly; allow part marking such as stamping or nameplate riveting; or offer machine-finish visual appeal in spots, {{without the need for}} finishing all over (FAO).|$|E
5000|$|The high {{nickel content}} block had a thicker deck, and a taller intake {{manifold}} {{due to the}} heads. It also had a distinct harmonic balancer, crankcase windage tray, bigger diameter alternator pulley (from the 289HIPO), and bigger diameter power steering pulley all to accommodate the higher RPM capabilities of the engine vs a standard 302. The engine also came with an engine RPM limiter (to protect the owner's warranty options but was often {{one of the first}} things removed). The Boss 302 has eight valve cover bolts; in '69 they were chrome and in '70 cast aluminum, while the standard 302 has six. The connecting rods are the same as used in the 289 HIPO, and have an engineering number of C3AE-D on them. They are capable of higher RPMs than standard 302 rods (up to ~8k RPM), aided by a <b>spot</b> <b>face</b> for 3/8 inch bolts with a unique football-shaped head (vs 5/16 for standard small blocks), and beefier cap. The crankshaft is cross drilled (this was changed in 1970 for better reliability) high strength steel forging. The cam and lifters are high lift, solid mechanical units. The cam featured 290 degrees duration and [...]477 inches of lift.|$|E

5000|$|Backspotfacing (back <b>spot</b> <b>facing)</b> is {{analogous}} to backboring, meaning that the tool manages to reach {{to the far side}} of the workpiece (away from the spindle side) and cut back toward the spindle. Such operations can be done with boring bars reaching through a hole while shifted off-center, then shifting onto center for the cut, or with back-deburring style tools whose cutting edges open and close in umbrella-like or check-valve-like fashion.|$|R

50|$|A {{self-aligning}} nut, {{also known}} as a spherical nut or leveling nut, is a type of nut that is used in applications where the fastener is not perpendicular to the surface the nut anchors to. It achieves this action by using a flanged nut inside a specially shaped dished-out washer. They are commonly used in the aerospace industry. If this nut were not used the object would have to be <b>spot</b> <b>faced</b> perpendicular to the fastener.|$|R

Two mighty blows and the chains yielded, and the drawbridge fell with a crash across the moat.|$|R
