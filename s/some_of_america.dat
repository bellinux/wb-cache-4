40|$|Excerpt] Recently {{a number}} of books and {{articles}} have appeared which should persuade historians to reconsider <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>America</b> 2 ̆ 7 s activities during World War II. One work, British Intelligence in the Second World War (1981), now in its second volume, reveals how much more British Intelligence knew about German affairs than many officials at the time acknowledged and than historians had imagined. Other studies, based on state and private archives in England, France, Germany, Israel, and the United States, have presented new details and insights to officialdoms in Western democracies, ranging from those in military command to bureaucrats in Vichy, France to public servants in Palestine. Two books written for the general public as much as for the profession, Martin Gilbert 2 ̆ 7 s Auschwitz and the Allies and Lucy S. Dawidowicz 2 ̆ 7 s The Holocaust and the Historians, provoke important questions about the behavior of Americans when they encountered Germany 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 Final Solution, 2 ̆ 2 during the war and in the historical records afterwards...|$|E

Several thousand people from all over the country participated in what has traditionally been the purview of major corporations and institutions, including 1120 individuals who signed the Micro Radio Empowerment Coalition comments.

Among these groups were <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>America</b> 2 ̆ 7 s largest labor unions-even though the decision applies equally to unions and for-profit corporations. The reason is clear: there exist both practical and structural impediments that will prevent unions from benefitting from Citizens United {{to the same extent}} as corporations. Therefore, Citizens United stands to unleash a torrent of corporate electioneering that could drown out the countervailing voice of organized labor. This article, however, takes a broader view of Citizens United to explore a possible silver lining for labor. It posits that, in articulating a wide-ranging vision of associations 2 ̆ 7 free speech rights, the Court undermined the intellectual basis of a lengthy string of cases that has limited the First Amendment protection applicable to labor related speech in other contexts, such as picketing, boycotting, and striking. Additionally, by discounting the First Amendment interests of dissenting shareholders, Citizens United calls into question the validity of restrictions on unions 2 ̆ 7 use of lawfully collected dues and fees for political speech and new organizing. Accordingly, this article concludes that Citizens United has the potential to impact significantly unions 2 ̆ 7 First Amendment rights outside of the campaign finance arena...|$|E
40|$|During {{the first}} half of the nineteenth century, travel {{accounts}} about America were one of the most popular forms of American literature. Those authored by American males are well-documented, but present-day scholars have virtually ignored the fact that American females also wrote accounts of their native land. ^ This study compares how male and female travel writers described four dominant antebellum American concerns: religion, nature, the status of slaves and Indians, and the role of women. It seeks to establish, within the context of opportunities open to the sexes at the time, what if any role gender played in shaping travelers 2 ̆ 7 responses and what if any implications this has for a twentieth-century understanding of that culture. ^ The study concludes that while gender sometimes played a role in influencing travel writers 2 ̆ 7 descriptions of America, any differences of viewpoint are more often than not differences of emphasis, not of basic belief, differences linked to females 2 ̆ 7 varying opportunities for contact with whom or what they described. Critics who ignore female travel accounts, however, obscure an important part of American literary history. Not only were female writers among the most widely-read authors of the era, but as practitioners of the travel writing genre, they also influenced the development of <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>America</b> 2 ̆ 7 s finest romantic fiction. Moreover, since the native American travel account constituted a genre not only different from European accounts of America but unique to much of antebellum American literature as well, critics who ignore female travel accounts deny the major role female travel writers played in the development of a uniquely American literature. ...|$|E
40|$|This Feature is an {{adaptation}} of chapter 3 of a forthcoming book, America 2 ̆ 7 s Unwritten Constitution, {{which in turn is}} a sequel to a 2005 book, America 2 ̆ 7 s Constitution: A Biography. The 2005 book explores America 2 ̆ 7 s written Constitution in considerable detail, taking readers on a journey that begins with the Preamble and proceeds through the document, Article by Article and Amendment by Amendment. The sequel invites readers to venture beyond the written Constitution by exploring aspects of America 2 ̆ 7 s constitutional order that are not expressly enumerated within the four corners of the document. The unifying theme of America 2 ̆ 7 s Unwritten Constitution is that there exist various approaches to American constitutionalism that supplement the terse text without supplanting it - nontextual interpretive methods and techniques that harmonize with the text itself. Chapter 3 of this forthcoming book -the foundation of this Feature - explores the domain of unenumerated rights. Although such rights are by definition not expressly listed in the terse text, the written Constitution signals their existence and provides broad guidance about where and how to find these rights. One of the most obvious places where these rights are to be discovered is in the lived practices and beliefs of the American people themselves. Another source of these 2 ̆ 2 lived 2 ̆ 2 rights is where Americans live: their homes. While privacy rights embody <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>America</b> 2 ̆ 7 s most notable examples of 2 ̆ 2 lived 2 ̆ 2 constitutional entitlements, this Feature places privacy examples alongside case studies drawn from criminal procedure and property law to illustrate the range, power, and limits of one general way of thinking about unenumerated rights. Whether the underlying (and underspecified) constitutional text is the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, Ninth, or Fourteenth Amendment, or some combination thereof, faithful constitutional interpreters properly attend to the expectations and practices of ordinary Americans who claim certain basic rights even though the terse text does not explicitly list these rights...|$|E

40|$|<b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>America</b> 2 ̆ 7 s most {{important}} judges have emphasized or embodied {{the practice of}} judicial statesmanship. Yet from the examples they set, it is not particularly clear what judicial statesmanship is or why it matters. In this Article, I conceptualize the elusive phenomenon of judicial statesmanship, and I defend statesmanship as a core, if underappreciated, dimension of judicial role. I argue that judicial statesmanship defines a virtue {{in the role of}} a judge. Statesmanship charges judges with approaching cases so as to facilitate the capacity of the legal system to legitimate itself¿over the long run and with respect to the nation as a whole¿by accomplishing two paradoxically related preconditions and purposes of law: expressing social values as social circumstances change and sustaining social solidarity amidst reasonable, irreconcilable disagreement. I derive judicial statesmanship from an understanding of the preconditions of law 2 ̆ 7 s public legitimation and from an understanding of the purposes of the institution of law. I demonstrate that statesmanship is a necessary, although not sufficient, component of judicial role. I argue that judicial statesmanship is not sufficient to legitimate the legal system because there are other major purposes of law with which statesmanship can be in tension, especially those advanced by maintaining fidelity to such rule-of-law values as consistency and transparency. But I also argue that statesmanship is necessary if law is to fulfill all of its functions and to take account of the conditions of its own legitimation. The rule of law depends for its practical realization on political trust {{between the government and the}} governed. In circumstances in which trust is strained, the virtue of statesmanship is especially valuable and produces leadership. I illustrate the present importance of judicial statesmanship by engaging some instances of its existence or absence during the U. S. Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s October 2006 Term. I argue that Justice Kennedy 2 ̆ 7 s controlling opinion in Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1 seems in important ways to exhibit the practice of judicial statesmanship but that his majority opinion in Gonzales v. Carhart will in most respects likely prove a failure of statesmanship...|$|E
40|$|The {{occupation}} of Wounded Knee, South Dakota, in 1973 {{by members of}} the American Indian Movement (AIM) and Lakota supporters and their seventy-one day standoff against the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Pine Ridge Reservation police provides a rich medium to study social movements, tribal politics, and federal policy. Its complexity, controversial nature, and relative temporal proximity have contributed to the 2 ̆ 2 second Wounded Knee 2 ̆ 2 receiving less attention than it deserves. In Wounded Knee II, Rolland Dewing has provided a serviceable foray into the event’s complexities. Dewing, Professor of History at Chadron State College in Nebraska, long-time resident of the Pine Ridge area, and founder of the Great Plains Network, draws heavily upon his earlier work, Wounded Knee: The Meaning and Significance of the Second Incident, for this new volume. He also relies extensively on some twenty-five thousand pages of FBI file material obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, as well as interviews with participants, and newspaper reports. Dewing begins with a sweeping survey of Lakota history from the eighteenth century through the early 1970 s in the first chapter. He devotes the next seven chapters to examining AIM 2 ̆ 7 s foundations, events that led to the Wounded Knee occupation, the occupation itself, and its resolution. These chapters are the book 2 ̆ 7 s heart and soul, providing an extraordinarily detailed account of the standoff. In the closing chapter-the best-written in the book-Dewing follows the careers of principal players through the 1980 s and concludes that although AIM 2 ̆ 7 s future looks dim, it {{played a significant role in}} promoting positive change for <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>America</b> 2 ̆ 7 s indigenous peoples. Readers familiar with Dewing 2 ̆ 7 s first outing will find helpful additions in his new work. Maps of the Pine Ridge Reservation and the Wounded Knee community help the reader understand the events, and the author has included an extensive and helpful bibliography. Overall, however, Wounded Knee II rates low on readability. The book lacks a strong thesis and Dewing 2 ̆ 7 s dense prose and love of minutiae frequently hinder the reader. Poor editing has also left many errors, sometimes several to a page. Those studying the 1973 occupation will find Dewing 2 ̆ 7 s diligent research valuable and should consult this book for his sympathetic take on the federal position. Those with a casual interest will find greater rewards elsewhere...|$|E
40|$|The {{restaurant}} industry now takes in over 500 billion a year, but recent courts have been {{skeptical of the}} notion that one of its most valuable assets, original recipes, are subject to copyright protection. With more litigation looming and the contours of the debate insufficiently mapped out, this article establishes the appropriate groundwork for analyzing the copyrightability of recipes. I show that, contrary to recent appellate court opinions, recipes meet the statutory requirements for copyrightability. I argue, by analogizing to musical compositions, that written recipes work to satisfy the fixation requirement of copyright law just as musical notation does for compositions. Accordingly, the 2 ̆ 2 dish 2 ̆ 2 is the final work of authorship, the recipe is the fixation medium, and the various cooking techniques - braising, grilling, sous vide - are the potentially patentable processes. In order to meet copyright law 2 ̆ 7 s requirement of originality, though, the work must be deemed expressive. To determine whether and how recipes are expressive, I interviewed <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>America</b> 2 ̆ 7 s best chefs, each of whom claimed to use recipes to express various ideas and emotions. Since there are no doctrinal limitations to recipes 2 ̆ 7 copyrightability, in Part II, I offer reasons for the late recognition as protectable works. First, I consider the marginalized status of the sense of taste in the history of Western aesthetic philosophy. For many philosophers, only objects that presented themselves to the eyes and ears, such as music, painting, and literature, could be truly beautiful. Partly out of the fear that fancy foods can lead to gluttony, Western, and more specifically Anglo-American writers have often tried to limit cuisine to its fundamentally nutritive components, further isolating it from the realm of creative expression. Furthermore, the producers of cuisine have been treated no better than their products. Throughout history cooking has been the province of lowly household servants and housewives, with only a select few chefs rising to the status of artisan. Chefs rose from the ranks of obscurity far more slowly than did writers, painters, and musicians. Finally, chefs {{have a long history of}} directly copying recipes and dishes from their predecessors, suggesting that the norms of Romantic original authorship formed much later in cuisine than in other arts. In Part III, I return to the law to consider whether the copyright monopoly should be extended to culinary creations. Chefs are not likely to take serious advantage of copyrights, as the time and money necessary for suit would rarely be worth the benefit. The chefs I interviewed were uncomfortable with the idea of owning their recipes, and they all approved of others using their recipes, subject to certain limits. Increased innovation is also unlikely as a more robust intellectual property regime would likely inhibit chefs 2 ̆ 7 willingness to experiment with other chefs 2 ̆ 7 dishes. Furthermore, the public domain would not see any meaningful increase, because few chefs who currently keep their recipes secret will be persuaded to publish them to obtain the limited benefits of copyright. The article concludes by arguing that formal copyright protection is not necessary for culinary creation, because a vibrant system of social norms already exists to sanction plagiarism, encourage attribution, and reward innovation. Thus, although recipes meet the formal doctrinal requirements of copyright law, an extension of the monopoly is neither necessary nor appropriate at this time...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the moral convictions, or the lack of same, in the {{personal}} character of Arthur Miller and Elia Kazan and to show how those convictions affected not only their work and personal friendship but society as well. They first met in 1946 when Harold Clurman of the Group Theater passed to Kazan a Miller play that he had read entitled All My Sons. With the success of the play, the two became fast friends and collaborators in profession and ideology. Each had in common the Great Depression, problem fathers, marital instability and Communism. For a short period during the 1930 s, both men belonged to the Communist Party. Kazan was deeply committed to the cause, whereas Miller preferred to watch from a distance and take notes that may eventually become the basis for a future play. Miller 2 ̆ 7 s was a more intellectual approach to Communism while Kazan was a pro-active member of the rank and file. They disdained capitalism and considered the business world, in Kazan 2 ̆ 7 s word, 2 ̆ 2 antihuman 2 ̆ 2. They worked well together and in 1949 did Death of a Salesman. Its theme could be interpreted as the anti-American dream. For both men, Miller 2 ̆ 7 s plays served as a sounding board for what they considered to be a social injustice. On stage and in the movies they confronted the mores of the time. Eventually what they wrote and produced would come under the scrutiny of the federal government. The House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) investigated them. Senator Joseph McCarthy had predicated his senate investigation on the subversive anti-American, anti-Christian immorality and atheism of Communism that he thought was intent on overthrowing America. He attacked the theater and entertainment industry in an effort to rid it and America of what became known as 2 ̆ 2 slanted writing 2 ̆ 2 [...] plays and movies that contained hints of Communist doctrine. McCarthy accused <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>America</b> 2 ̆ 7 s finest artists of subversion and demanded they confess their Communist connections and name the names of their comrades or 2 ̆ 2 fellow travelers 2 ̆ 2 as they came to be known. Though their short three-year friendship was strong and binding, it would not, and could not, survive this attack. It could not survive because Kazan had violated Miller 2 ̆ 7 s personal values. When the HUAC asked Miller to give them the names of his fellow travelers, he refused and was convicted of contempt of Congress. However, Kazan named names; including Miller 2 ̆ 7 s. It would be almost 10 years before they would speak again. In the interim, they spoke to each other and the world through their work, specifically Miller 2 ̆ 7 s The Crucible and Kazan 2 ̆ 7 s On the Waterfront. Proctor, the adulterous protagonist of The Crucible, would rather be hanged than betray himself by confessing to something he didn 2 ̆ 7 t do. Terry Malloy, the stool pigeon of Waterfront becomes a state witness for the prosecution in the conviction of corrupt union bosses on the docks. In their own way, and in their best style, Miller and Kazan tried to explain and justify their actions. Each thought what they did was the morally right thing to do. This paper will explore how the character convictions of Arthur Miller and Elia Kazan determined their HUAC testimony and how what they said and did affected the American culture and the world in general...|$|E
