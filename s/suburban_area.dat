5|$|The {{house is}} architecturally {{significant}} as a well-designed and well-preserved late 19th century suburban residence, with excellent interior detail and a matching carriagehouse. The {{area in which}} it is located was situated in an upper-class <b>suburban</b> <b>area,</b> but since the late 19th-century commercial and industrial buildings have entered the area. The property was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{official}} papers on the line's construction, when the line first opened for trains between Sydney and Sutherland construction was not quite complete, so excursion services initially ran on weekends only until the entire line was handed over. The first official train ran within the modern-day <b>suburban</b> <b>area</b> on 9 December 1885, although the line was closed once again between December 1885 and January 1886 to permit testing on the new bridge over the Georges River.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Many {{bumblebee}} {{species are}} declining {{at a rapid}} rate in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. This is commonly attributed to the decline in floral resources that has resulted from an intensification in farming practices. Here we assess growth of nests of the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, in habitats providing different levels of floral resources. Experimental nests were placed out in conventional farmland, in farmland with flower-rich conservation measures and in <b>suburban</b> <b>areas.</b> Nests gained weight more quickly and attained a larger final size in <b>suburban</b> <b>areas</b> compared to elsewhere. The diversity of pollens gathered by bees was highest in <b>suburban</b> <b>areas,</b> and lowest in conventional farmland. Nests in <b>suburban</b> <b>areas</b> were also more prone to attack by the specialist bumblebee parasite Aphomia sociella, suggestin...|$|R

5|$|According to the 2010 Malaysian census, {{the town}} of Sibu (excluding <b>suburban</b> <b>area)</b> has total {{population}} of 162,676. Chinese (62.1%, 101,019) is the largest ethnic group in the town, followed by indigenous people (35.01%, 56,949), non-Malaysians (1.99%, 3,236), and Indians (0.37%, 598).

He served on the County Council from 1970 to 1972 while continuing his private law practice. Among issues he addressed on the council was his opposition to large highway projects that might disrupt Wilmington neighborhoods, including those related to Interstate 95.|$|E

5|$|Round Hill (sometimes spelt Roundhill) is {{an inner}} <b>suburban</b> <b>area</b> of Brighton, {{part of the}} coastal city of Brighton and Hove in England. The area {{contains}} a mix of privately owned and privately rented terraced housing, much {{of which has been}} converted for multiple occupancy, and small-scale commercial development. It was developed mostly in the late 19th century on an area of high land overlooking central Brighton, and with good views in all directions, the area became a desirable middle-class suburb—particularly the large terraced houses of Roundhill Crescent and Richmond Road, and the exclusive Park Crescent—and within a few decades the whole of the hill had been built up with smaller terraces and some large villas.|$|E
5|$|East of Middletown, US40Alternate {{passes through}} a <b>suburban</b> <b>area</b> then begins to ascend Braddock Mountain. The highway gains a {{climbing}} lane eastbound {{to the top of}} the mountain, which contains the community of Braddock Heights. On the descent of Braddock Mountain, US40Alternate expands to a four-lane road, with one lane eastbound, two lanes westbound, and a center turn lane. At the base of the mountain, the alternate route temporarily expands to a four-lane divided highway through its half-diamond interchange with I-70, which has ramps to and from the direction of Frederick. East of I-70, US40Alternate reduces to two lanes and passes the Highland Lodge. The alternate route reaches its eastern terminus at a partial intersection with US40 (Patrick Street) at the western edge of Frederick and the Frederick Golden Mile, a heavily commercialized area east to US15 (Frederick Freeway). There is no direct access from eastbound US40Alternate to westbound US40 or from eastbound US40 to the westbound alternate route; those movements are made by using Old Camp Road.|$|E
5|$|Highgrove House, {{also known}} as High Grove House or High Grove, is a Grade II listed mansion in the <b>suburban</b> <b>area</b> of Ruislip, within the London Borough of Hillingdon. Originally built in 1750 by the Reverend John Lidgould, the house was rebuilt in 1881 by Sir Hugh Hume-Campbell {{following}} a catastrophic fire. Along with Haydon Hall and Eastcote House, Highgrove {{was one of the}} three main houses of Eastcote and eventually became a residential hostel for homeless families, run by the local council from the 1960s until 2007. An area of the estate was sold to the local council in 1935 by the then-owner Eleanor Warrender to become what is now Warrender Park. In 1975, the house was granted Grade II listed status on account of its special architectural character.|$|E

5|$|MD32 {{continues}} {{north as}} a two-lane road to Sykesville. Just {{south of the}} town, the state highway intersects West Friendship Road, the old alignment of MD32 that is now unsigned MD851. MD32 veers northeast and crosses the Patapsco River and CSX's Old Main Line Subdivision into Carroll County; immediately {{to the east of}} MD32's crossing is the highway's old aluminum bridge. The state highway passes to the west of Springfield Hospital Center, whose original buildings are preserved as the Warfield Complex, Hubner, and T Buildings. MD32 temporarily expands to a four-lane divided highway at its intersection with Springfield Avenue, which is the northern end of MD851, and continues north into the suburban community of Eldersburg. The state highway expands to a four-lane divided highway at Piney Ridge Parkway and maintains that form through its intersection with MD26 (Liberty Road). MD32 continues through the <b>suburban</b> <b>area</b> as a four-lane undivided highway with two lanes northbound, one lane southbound, and a center turn lane. The state highway passes to the east of Liberty High School and reduces to two lanes north of Bennett Road.|$|E
