40|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} methods for production of peroxide cross-linked poly-ethylene {{in the form of}} pipe, cable, sheet, etc. In this study <b>shear</b> <b>head</b> as a newapproach method was applied for continuous cross-linking of low density poly-ethylene. The <b>shear</b> <b>head</b> was designed and constructed and coupled with a modu-lar single screw extruder. The screws of <b>shear</b> <b>head</b> were Maddock, Egan and Troester with 0. 4 mm gap. The highest increment in temperature of compound was around 30 C in <b>shear</b> <b>head</b> for Maddock screw. Cross-linking was confirmed by gel fraction and mechanical tests. The highest gel fraction was related to 2 wt % of dicumyl peroxide (DCP) and Maddock screw. With increasing of DCP the tensile strength and elongation-at-break increased. The highest increment in tensile strength belonged to samples with above 70 % gel fraction (2 wt % DCP and Maddock screw). Due to stretching and chain orientation of polymer compound in <b>shear</b> <b>head</b> (by high speed rotation of screw in short die land) these properties increased continuously to high gel fraction (90 %). If this method is coupled with other commercialized methods, the efficiency of cross-linking reaction of low density polyethylene and the quality of product would improve. In such case the energy consumption would also be lowered and the length of the production lines would be considerably shortened from the cur-rent methods.

40|$|For {{laboratory}} use, {{the authors}} constructed a 2 ̆ 2 High Speed Annuler Shear Device KS- 12 ̆ 2 which could vary the annulus speed {{with respect to}} soil from 3 to 150 cm/sec and tried to see {{the effect of the}} speed and annulus materials on the soil-to-annulus friction, finding that the existing method of determining shear strength was unsuitable, principally because of no consideration of the speed. Besides, transient phenomenon of <b>shear</b> <b>head</b> was also analyzed theoretically. The most important conclusions of this investigation are as follows: 1. The relation between external frictional stress F and normal stress σ, so called F-σ curve, was found non-linear unlike Coulomb 2 ̆ 7 s theory. So, the authors deduced the reason as follows: The condition of frictional plane might change as σ increased, then internal friction began to be seen, whereas real external friction was seen when σ was small. 2. The relation between internal frictional stress S and normal stress σ, so called S-σ curve, was found non-linear unlike Coulomb 2 ̆ 7 s theory. So, the authors deduced that some shear failure around annulus rim due to vertical loading might occur in the soil prior to shear test. 3. In case of determining cohesion c and coefficient of internal friction tanϕ, therefore, it must be fully noted that the loading will be subjected to restriction. For the soil used, the upper limit of σ was around 0. 7 Kg/cm^ 2. 4. For high fidelity measuring by strain gauge method, it is required to design <b>shear</b> <b>head</b> so as to get its natural frequency high. 5. At high speed friction, damped oscillations were seen on the chart. Therefore, the mean value of the oscillations must be read up for the data. 6. The shear stress was described by the equation S = c+K_vV^n + σtanϕ in which K_v, and n are the new soil values. 7. Effect of annulus materials on the internal frictional stress was quite observed. annulusと土の相対すべり速度を 3 ～ 150 cm/secに変化できる室内実験用のannular土壌常数測定機KS- 1 型を試作し,摩擦抵抗に及ぼすすべり速度の影響と,外部摩擦抵抗に及ぼすannulus材質の影響を調べ,急速せん断時のせん断部の過渡現象の解析をも合わせ行ない以下の結論を得た. 1) 外部摩擦応力Fと垂直応力σの関係は,クーロンの式に反し非直線(F-σ曲線) とみなされる. これは,σが小のとき外部摩擦が観察されたものが,σ→大で摩擦面の状態が変わり,内部摩擦が観察されるようになつたためと推論した. 2) KS- 1 型による測定では,内部摩擦応力Sと垂直応力σの関係も,σが比較的大のときは非直線(S-σ曲線) とみなされる. これは,載荷重によるannulus周辺の土のせん断破壊が試験に先だつて起るためと推論した. 3) 凝集力cと内部摩擦係数tanφの測定に際しては, σの上限設定について充分に注意を払うべきことを提言した. なお,本験に用いた試判ではσの上限は 0. 7 kg/cm^ 2 程度であつた. 4) 急速摩擦時の土の抵抗をストレーンゲージ法で忠実に測定するには,せん断部の固有振動数をできるだけ高く設計すべきである. 5) 急速摩擦時はせん断部の減衰固有振動が記録紙上に現れる. したがつて,この振動曲線の平均を読み取りデータとすべきである. 6) 内部摩擦抵抗は,Vの関数項を含む式S = c+K_v・V^n + σtanφで表わせる. ここで,K_vとnは新しい土壌常数である. 7) Fに及ぼすannulus材質の影響がかなり認められた...|$|R

40|$|Steel and {{concrete}} composite systems are generally used as major structural components in multi-storey buildings. Composite construction in buildings is more popular with profiled steel sheeting (steel decking) since {{it serves as}} a working platform to support the construction loads and also as permanent formwork for concrete. To achieve large column free spans (in the range of 8 m- 12 m), as often demanded for multi-storey office buildings, "steel {{and concrete}} composite floor trusses" may form economical solutions since they provide the facility to accommodate various service ducts within the structural zone. The concept of introducing a concrete filled steel tube (CFST), instead of the conventional open flanged steel section, as the top chord of these floor trusses has been discussed. However, the viability of this new concept should be ensured by experimental evidence on the longitudinal shear transfer capacity at the composite stage.

40|$|Terminating {{action is}} a {{remedial}} repair which entails the replacement of <b>shear</b> <b>head</b> countersunk rivets with universal head rivets which have a larger shank diameter. The procedure was developed to eliminate the risk of widespread fatigue damage (WFD) in the upper rivet row of a fuselage lap joint. A test and evaluation program has been conducted by Foster-Miller, Inc. (FMI) to evaluate the terminating action repair of the upper rivet row of a commercial aircraft fuselage lap splice. Two full scale fatigue tests were conducted on fuselage panels using the growth of fatigue cracks in the lap joint. The second test was performed {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of the terminating action repair. In both tests, cyclic pressurization loading was applied to the panels while crack propagation was recorded at all rivet locations at regular intervals to generate detailed data on conditions of fatigue crack initiation, ligament link-up, and fuselage fracture. This program demonstrated that the terminating action repair substantially increases the fatigue life of a fuselage panel structure and effectively eliminates the occurrence of cracking in the upper rivet row of the lap joint. While high cycle crack growth was recorded in the middle rivet row during the second test, failure was not imminent when the test was terminated after cycling to well beyond the service life. The program also demonstrated that the initiation, propagation, and linkup of WFD in full-scale fuselage structures can be simulated and quantitatively studied in the laboratory. This paper presents an overview of the testing program and provides a detailed discussion of the data analysis and results. Crack distribution and propagation rates and directions as well as frequency of cracking are presented for both tests.

This is done through a proposed power law failure function, whose coefficients are taken from ring <b>shear</b> and conical <b>head</b> tensile data for plating/substrate combinations and whose exponent is determined from one set of plated-joint data. Experimental results are presented for Al-Ni-Al (7075 -T 6) and AM 3 fi 3 -Ni-AM 363 joints, and the failure function is used to predict joint strengths for Al-Ni-Al (2024 -T 6), UTi-Ni-UTi, and Be-Ti-Be...|$|R
40|$|Accelerated bridge {{construction}} (ABC) {{relies heavily on}} prefabricated reinforced concrete members. One method to connect prefabricated columns to footings or cap beams is {{through the use of}} mechanical bar splices commonly referred to as couplers. Even though current seismic codes prohibit application of couplers in the plastic hinge area of columns located in moderate and high seismic zones, recent studies have revealed the feasibility of precast columns utilizing couplers in the plastic hinge zones helping expand ABC in this zones. Several types of mechanical bar splices each with a unique performance and anchoring mechanism are available in the U. S. market. Five of these were included in this study: <b>shear</b> screw, <b>headed</b> bar, grouted, threaded, and swaged couplers. A state-of-the-art literature search was conducted to compile and interpret data on the seismic performance of these coupler types as well as columns incorporating these couplers in the plastic hinge zones. Findings were summarized and tabulated. Subsequently, coupler acceptance criteria for seismic applications and acceptance criteria for ductile column...|$|R
