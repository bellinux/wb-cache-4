5000|$|Many names, {{some of them}} trademarked, {{have been}} used for {{marginal}} punched-card systems:edge-notched cards, <b>slotted</b> <b>cards,</b> E-Z Sort, Zatocards, McBee, McBee Keysort, Flexisort, Velom, Rocket, etc.The center of each card held the relevant information—typically the name and author of a book, research paper, or journal article on a nearby shelf; and a list of subjects and keywords.Some sets of cards contained all the information required by the user on the card itself, handwritten, typewritten, or on microfilm (aperture card).Every card in a stack had the same set of pre-punched holes.The user would find the particular cards relevant to a search by aligning the holes in the set of cards (using a card holder or card tray), inserting one or more knitting-needle-like rods {{all the way through the}} stack, so the desired cards (which had been notched or cut open) fell out from the irrelevant cards in the collection (left un-notched), which remain on the needle(s).A user could repeat this selection many times to form a complex Boolean searching query.A card that was relevant to 2 or more subjects would have the slot(s) for each of those subjects cut out, so that card would drop out when either one or the other or both subjects was selected [...]The [...] "superimposed code" [...] coding systems, such as Zatocoding, saved space by entering several or all subjects in the same field; such a [...] "superimposed code" [...] stores much more information in less space, but at the cost of occasional [...] "false" [...] selections.|$|E

40|$|The compact {{spinning}} {{systems are}} mostly used for spinning of combed yarns. However, many {{attempts have been}} made to use the compact system for spinning carded yarns. Recently SUESSEN has introduced D–Type slot compact system for producing carded compact yarn. In this research work, an attempt has been made to analyze the migration properties of D–Type <b>slot</b> <b>carded</b> compact yarn. Three different twist factors have been selected and compared with regular carded compact yarn and regular carded ring yarn. In this work, the migration parameters such as Mean Fiber Position, Root Mean Squared (RMS) Deviation, Migration Intensity and Yarn Diameter have been measured using the Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) camera attached on a projection microscope. D–Type <b>slot</b> <b>carded</b> compact yarn, regular compact and regular ring yarn structures have been critically analyzed using Scanning Electron Microscope. The test results clearly indicate that the fiber migration in D–Type slot compact yarn is far better than both regular compact and regular ring yarns...|$|R

There is a constraint that must be satisfied to generate all possible states. Each card can be used only once. For example, {{it is impossible to}} create the state 131, which means that the first card is used twice, in the first slot and the third slot.

5000|$|Riser {{cards are}} used in rack-mount server and {{industrial}} computer applications. In 1U and 2U rack-mount computer systems, riser cards are integrated into the system to allow the addition of feature cards in a horizontal position (instead of a standard vertical position).
