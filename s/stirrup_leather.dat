25|$|Side-saddle stirrups: {{usually have}} a {{slightly}} larger eye to accommodate the thicker <b>stirrup</b> <b>leather</b> on a sidesaddle.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two basic}} methods of using stirrups, a shorter stirrup to allow more {{mobility}} and a longer stirrup to allow greater control. The stirrup itself is similar, but {{the length of the}} <b>stirrup</b> <b>leather</b> is different. In each case, the stirrup length allows the rider to remain over the center of balance of the horse for the average speed characteristic of the discipline; the faster the horse travels, the more forward the rider must be positioned, and hence the shorter the stirrup.|$|E
25|$|A stirrup {{is a light}} frame or {{ring that}} holds {{the foot of a}} rider, {{attached}} to the saddle by a strap, often called a <b>stirrup</b> <b>leather.</b> Stirrups are usually paired and are used to aid in mounting and as a support while using a riding animal (usually a horse or other equine, such as a mule). They greatly increase the rider's ability to stay in the saddle and control the mount, increasing the animal's usefulness to humans in areas such as communication, transportation and warfare.|$|E

2500|$|Because a rider {{must be able}} to {{move his}} or her legs while riding, {{stirrups}} cannot be attached on the body of the saddle itself, but rather must be attached in a manner that allows the rider's leg a full range of motion. [...] Therefore, stirrups are attached to a saddle by means of adjustable straps, called <b>stirrup</b> <b>leathers.</b> Depending on the design of a saddle, <b>stirrup</b> <b>leathers</b> may be attached to a [...] "stirrup bar," [...] a small forged steel bar embedded into the saddle tree, or may be wrapped around the bars of the tree itself. [...] Because different riders are of different heights, and stirrups also may need to be adjusted up or down to accommodate different types of activity, <b>stirrup</b> <b>leathers</b> have buckles and holes that allow length to be adjusted.|$|R
5000|$|The jumping {{position}} is a position used by equestrians when jumping over an obstacle. It usually involves {{what is known}} as the [...] "forward seat" [...] or [...] "2 point" [...] because the rider's legs provide two points over which the rider's weight is balanced on the horse. It was first developed by Captain Federico Caprilli. This involves the rider centered over his or her feet, with the <b>stirrup</b> <b>leathers</b> perpendicular to the ground. Continuing a line upwards from the <b>stirrup</b> <b>leathers,</b> the head and shoulders fall in front of the line, as do the knees, the hips fall behind it.|$|R
25|$|Cleaning is an {{important}} part of caring for tack. Tack that is not cleaned will start to build up sweat and dirt, which will cause uncomfortable rubbing on the horse. Sweat and dirt also tend to cause cracking in leather, which may result in breaking. This not only decreases the value of the saddle, but can be very dangerous if critical equipment, such as a <b>stirrup</b> <b>leather,</b> breaks mid-ride. Proper care and conditioning of the saddle will not only increase its useful life, but will also help to retain its value.|$|E
25|$|While an inexperienced rider {{may feel}} more secure with a {{slightly}} too-short stirrup, in reality, it is actually easier to be thrown from the horse because the rider's legs act as a stabilizing agent, much {{in the same way}} the long pole of a tightrope walker balances the acrobat. Obviously, a <b>stirrup</b> <b>leather</b> so long that a rider cannot reach it is useless, and a stirrup length that does not allow a rider with a properly positioned leg to keep the heel lower than the toe is also easily lost. However, shortening the stirrup until the rider feels they will not lose the stirrup is counterproductive; the goal of correct equestrianism is to make maximum use of the leg. Lengthening the leg creates a more secure seat, while shortening the stirrup is done only to accommodate the needs of the horse to perform athletic movement. Thus correct stirrup length creates a balance between control and mobility that fits the discipline performed.|$|E
2500|$|The stirrup of {{a western}} saddle is more {{difficult}} to remove or replace than the English stirrup and therefore, unless damaged or a different style is desired, the same stirrups usually are kept on {{for the life of the}} saddle itself. [...] The tread is mostly flat, but may be curved at the sides to some degree. [...] The branches are wide at the bottom and narrow at the top, where they are joined by a heavy dowel of wood, or rod of metal. [...] The <b>stirrup</b> <b>leather</b> loops under the rod and a [...] "keeper," [...] a strap with a buckle that wraps around the front and back of the <b>stirrup</b> <b>leather,</b> keeps the stirrup in place. [...] Western stirrups are generally made of leather-covered wood, others of steel, aluminum, or even very strong fiber-reinforced plastic.|$|E

6000|$|... (I {{have tried}} several plans, {{and find that}} which is shown in Fig. 1 to be {{thoroughly}} comfortable and secure. A stick forms the seat' {{at either end of}} it is a short stirrup; garters secure the <b>stirrup</b> <b>leathers</b> to the knees; there is a belt under the arms.) ...|$|R
2500|$|Modern English saddles are {{designed}} with a stirrup bar that allows the <b>stirrup</b> <b>leathers</b> to fall from the saddle if the rider starts to be dragged. [...] Some English stirrups are also designed with breakaway sides or non-standard designs intended {{to make it easier}} for the foot to come out of the stirrup when necessary.|$|R
2500|$|A saddle {{is often}} worn when a horse is longeing. In these circumstances, it is {{important}} that the stirrups do not bang against the horse's side. On an English saddle, the stirrups are [...] "run up." [...] To do this, run up the stirrups as they are kept when the saddle is off the horse, then bring the loop of <b>stirrup</b> <b>leather</b> around the stirrup iron before bringing it under the back branch and attaching looping the end of the leather (with the holes in it) through the <b>stirrup</b> <b>leather</b> keeper. [...] Stirrups on a western saddle cannot be run up, so they are usually tied together under the belly of the horse with a piece of twine or rope, though for a very skittish young horse they also can be thrown up over the top of the saddle and tied down in that fashion.|$|E
2500|$|As the rider's whole weight must {{be carried}} {{at one side}} when mounting, on an English saddle, one <b>stirrup</b> <b>leather</b> often becomes {{stretched}} longer than the other, usually the left one, because most mounting occurs on that side. [...] While a simple adjustment of the leather can even up the stirrups, to preserve the integrity and longevity of the leathers, they should be switched to the opposite sides from time to time. [...] On a western saddle, with a heavier, permanently installed fender and <b>stirrup</b> <b>leather</b> that cannot be switched, stretching is slower and less extreme, though it also occurs {{in this type of}} saddle. [...] Any unevenness in the leathers can be managed by adjusting the stirrup length, and if necessary, by adding extra holes in the leathers to allow them to be buckled at an intermediate point between the existing prepunched holes provided by the saddle manufacturer.|$|E
2500|$|Stirrup fit varies greatly between disciplines, {{from the}} very short stirrup of the horse racing jockey to the long stirrup of the {{dressage}} or reining competitor. [...] However, in all cases, the <b>stirrup</b> <b>leather</b> must be properly placed so that the rider remains in balance over the saddle and is not thrown ahead or behind {{the motion of the}} horse when putting weight in the stirrups.|$|E
60|$|Then Hugh swung {{himself to}} the saddle of which Grey Dick had already tested the girths and <b>stirrup</b> <b>leathers.</b> In another minute the six of them were {{clattering}} over the stones of Middlegate Street, while the burgesses of Dunwich peeped from their window places, wondering what knight with armed men rode through their town thus early.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nay, it cannot be,' {{the taller}} said. 'Corporal, {{do you take}} him down. Henderson will go with you. Take from him that plate and sword, which his mother would wear with as good a grace. And hark ye, corporal, a few touches of thy <b>stirrup</b> <b>leathers</b> across his fat {{shoulders}} might not be amiss, as helping him to remember the King's dragoons.' ...|$|R
60|$|Winston swung {{himself into}} the saddle, a trifle awkwardly, for Courthorne rode with longer <b>stirrup</b> <b>leathers</b> than he was {{accustomed}} to, then he raised one hand, and the other man laughed a little as he watched him sink {{into the darkness of}} the shadowy prairie. When the drumming of hoofs was lost in the moaning of the wind he strode towards the stable, and taking up the lantern surveyed Winston's horse thoughtfully.|$|R
2500|$|Half chaps, {{also known}} as chapettes, are a popular style of equestrian gaiters that extend from the ankle to just below the knee. [...] When worn over a short paddock boot they give the {{protection}} {{and some of the}} appearance of a tall riding boot, but at lower cost. [...] They are widely worn by children in horse shows and by trail riders. Half chaps usually are made of leather, and have a zipper or hook and loop closure on the outside. [...] They provide grip for the rider, and protection from sweat and the <b>stirrup</b> <b>leather.</b> They are commonly used over the paddock boots of English-style riders in place of tall boots. [...] While not true chaps, some Western-style riders use half chaps, particularly in hot weather, but gaiter-style half chaps are not traditional cowboy gear.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson had a poor {{reputation}} as a horseman. One of his soldiers, Georgia volunteer William Andrews, wrote that Jackson was [...] "a very ordinary looking man of medium size, his uniform badly soiled {{as though it had}} seen hard service. He wore a cap pulled down nearly to his nose and was riding a rawboned horse that did not look much like a charger, unless it would be on hay or clover. He certainly made a poor figure on a horseback, with his <b>stirrup</b> <b>leather</b> six inches too short, putting his knees nearly level with his horse's back, and his heels turned out with his toes sticking behind his horse's foreshoulder. A sorry description of our most famous general, but a correct one." [...] His horse was named [...] "Little Sorrel" [...] (also known as [...] "Old Sorrel"), a small chestnut gelding which ironically was a captured Union horse from a Connecticut farm. He rode Little Sorrel throughout the war, and was riding him when he was shot at Chancellorsville. Little Sorrel died at age 36 and is buried near a statue of Jackson on the parade grounds of VMI. (His mounted hide is on display in the VMI Museum.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Strap {{parts of}} the saddle, such as the <b>stirrup</b> <b>leathers,</b> billets (on an English saddle) and latigo (on a western saddle) also need conditioning, but it varies by climate. [...] In a dry climate, failure to oil straps may result in {{cracking}} and weakening of the leather, and they can snap or break. [...] In a more humid climate, too much oil may weaken the leather. [...] Properly conditioned leather is neither brittle nor floppy in texture and flexibility.|$|R
2500|$|On an English saddle, leathers {{are quite}} thin, {{only about one}} inch wide. [...] On a western saddle, they are very heavy, three to four inches wide on the side closest to the horse, and even wider, {{expanded}} into a decorative [...] "fender" [...] on the outside (which also protects the rider's legs from the sweat of the horse). [...] <b>Stirrup</b> <b>leathers</b> on other saddle designs fall in between the extremes represented by the English and western saddles.|$|R
50|$|During the 19th century gaiters for riding {{typically}} {{were known}} as riding gaiters, distinguishing them from the other gaiters that were in general use. Today, half chaps are a type of gaiter worn by equestrians. Most forms fit over the calf. These are intended to protect the rider's leg from wear by the <b>stirrup</b> <b>leathers</b> and other saddle parts. Modern styles usually have a zipper or hook and loop fasteners {{on the outside of}} the leg.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come nearer!' he hissed. 'Nearer still! Now {{dismount}} {{and pretend}} to be mending the <b>stirrup</b> <b>leather.</b> Spies may be watching us, and it means death to me if I am seen helping you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If so, I think Spaniards {{took them}} there, for I am {{sure they were}} not English in that craft," [...] said Thomas, as he ran {{by the side of}} Castell's horse, holding to the <b>stirrup</b> <b>leather.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "You well {{deserve to}} be hanged, if only because you have brought this woman, who is fair and gentle-spoken, to such a life," [...] said Nigel. [...] "Let us tie him by the wrist to my <b>stirrup</b> <b>leather,</b> Aylward, and we will lead him into Guildford." ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{horse is}} best mounted using a {{mounting}} block {{because it is}} easier for the rider to mount the horse, it puts less strain on the <b>stirrup</b> <b>leathers</b> when mounting and it decreases the chances of the saddle slipping to one side when mounting, thereby reducing the chances of a fall and possible injury to the rider. A horse or pony is most frequently mounted from the [...] "near" [...] side, that is the horse's left side.|$|R
50|$|Strap {{parts of}} the saddle, such as the <b>stirrup</b> <b>leathers,</b> billets (on an English saddle) and latigo (on a western saddle) also need conditioning, but it varies by climate.

60|$|Baynes {{checked in}} his stride, and swung round writhing, his face ashen. As a {{consequence}} he was jerked from his feet by the rope that attached {{him to the}} <b>stirrup</b> <b>leather,</b> and he was dragged helplessly a yard or two before the trooper reined in, cursing him foully, and striking him {{with the flat of}} his sword.|$|E
6000|$|... "'He didn't {{appreciate}} it,' said Tomassov, looking {{even more}} troubled than before. 'He came along holding to my <b>stirrup</b> <b>leather.</b> That's {{what made me}} so late. He {{told me he was}} a staff officer; and then talking in a voice such, I suppose, as the damned alone use, a croaking of rage and pain, he said he had a favour to beg of me. A supreme favour. Did I understand him, he asked in a sort of fiendish whisper.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{look that}} none of the links find their way to the wine house ere the monk touches them; for if it so chance, thou shalt taste of saddle girth and <b>stirrup</b> <b>leather</b> till thou art as raw as Saint Bartholomew [he was flayed alive.

60|$|So far, {{they had}} {{spread on the}} ground the robes found in the car. The men now added their coats, and Wemple, for {{additional}} traction, unsaddled the roan, and spread the cinches, <b>stirrup</b> <b>leathers,</b> saddle blanket, and bridle {{in the way of}} the wheels. The car took the treacherous slope in a rush, with churning wheels biting into the woven fabrics; and, with no more than a hint of hesitation, it cleared the crest and swung into the road.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Stirrup</b> <b>leathers</b> {{are usually}} {{manufactured}} {{so that the}} smooth side of the leather faces the wearing surface, as the smooth side wears less quickly than the rough side. There are also modern alternatives to leather, including nylon, plastic covered nylon (biothane being one example) or leather over a nylon reinforced core. These new [...] "leathers" [...] may last longer and also resist stretching. On the other hand, they may chafe and rub the leg, and poorly made products may break more easily than leather.|$|R
