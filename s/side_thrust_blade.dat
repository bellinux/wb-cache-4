50|$|On 30 March 1800, a General Order {{required}} cadets {{to wear a}} sword with a cut and <b>thrust</b> <b>blade</b> between 28 and 32 {{inches long}} and with a gilt hilt.|$|R
50|$|In 1801, {{a set of}} {{regulations}} was published stating that cadet swords {{should be the same}} as platoon officers' swords, 28-inch cut and <b>thrust</b> <b>blade</b> mounted according to the branch of service.|$|R
5000|$|It had a large, basket-shaped hilt {{mounting}} a straight, double-edged, <b>thrusting</b> <b>blade</b> {{designed for use}} by light cavalry. Although officially designated a saber, it lacks the curved edge typical of many models of saber.|$|R
50|$|On 22 September 1800, the Superintendent of Military Stores, Samuel Hodgdon, {{wrote to}} John Harris, a {{military}} storekeeper, that cadet and noncommissioned officers' swords should be brass mounted with cut and <b>thrust</b> <b>blade</b> 30 inches long.|$|R
5000|$|Little or no bore contact/piston <b>side</b> <b>thrust,</b> {{which reduces}} wear on {{cylinder}} bore.|$|R
50|$|The Model 1913 saber {{features}} a large, basket-shaped hilt mounting a straight, double-edged, <b>thrusting</b> <b>blade</b> {{designed for use}} by heavy cavalry. It was designed in accordance with Patton's system of swordsmanship, which was published by the War Department as the 1914 Saber Exercise manual, and which emphasized {{the use of the}} point over the edge.|$|R
50|$|Further {{issues are}} the {{foundations}} for the bridge. Arch bridges generate large <b>side</b> <b>thrusts</b> on their footings and so may require a solid bedrock foundation. Flattening the arch shape to avoid the humpback problem, such as for Brunel's Maidenhead bridge, increases this <b>side</b> <b>thrust.</b> It is often impossible to achieve a flat enough arch, simply owing to {{the limitations of the}} foundations - particularly in flat country. Historically, such bridges often became viaducts of multiple small arches.|$|R
40|$|Considering the {{equilibrium}} of forces due to the direction change of an eletric locomotive (two trucks articulated together) when it runs on curved track, the auther analized <b>side</b> <b>thrust</b> given to the rail by the leading and main trucks, dividing it into statical load and dynamical load caused by vibration, and concluded, by calculation using {{the data obtained by}} experiments on EE 15 type electric locomotives, that when main truck restoring force is large; electric locomotives now in operation show good running stability as rail <b>side</b> <b>thrust</b> is distributed uniformly on each driving axis...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} tests was {{conducted}} with a Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) wheel operating at yaw angles ranging from - 5 to + 90 deg. The load was varied from 42 to 82 lb (187 to 365 N), and the speed was varied from 3. 5 to 10. 0 ft/sec (1. 07 to 3. 05 m/sec). It was noted that speed {{had an effect on}} <b>side</b> <b>thrust</b> and rut depth. <b>Side</b> <b>thrust,</b> rut depth, and skid generally increased as the yaw angle increased. For the range of loads used, the effect of load on performance was not significant...|$|R

50|$|The 1845 sword {{enjoyed a}} long service life {{and was used}} {{successfully}} in colonial wars all over the world, often winning the praise of British soldiers who used it to defend their lives. However, in 1892 proponents of the theory that thrust should be used exclusively over cutting for swords prevailed and the cut and <b>thrust</b> <b>blade</b> {{was replaced by a}} straight dedicated <b>thrusting</b> <b>blade</b> with a thick, fullered, dumbbell section and a sharp spear point. A stronger sword, unburdened by the design compromises of a requirement to cut well, this was a triumph of academic theory over real world experience, although good soldiers can make the best of whatever equipment is available (Robson reports on its good performance against the Dervishes in the Sudan. It was during the Sudan campaign when a young Winston Churchill sheathed his sword before the charge and used his then shockingly modern Mauser Broomhandle semiautomatic pistol). Ironically the infantry were finally being given a new weapon as rifled and repeating firearms had rendered them almost entirely obsolete so there has not been any reason to replace the model 1897 sword with its poor cutting ability since it has been used almost exclusively for ceremonial purposes almost from the time it was adopted.|$|R
40|$|Secondary {{air flow}} is {{provided}} for a ducted fan having a reverse flow turbine engine core driving a fan blisk. The fan blisk incorporates {{a set of}} <b>thrust</b> fan <b>blades</b> extending from an outer hub {{and a set of}} integral secondary flow blades extending intermediate an inner hub and the outer hub. A nacelle provides an outer flow duct for the <b>thrust</b> fan <b>blades</b> and a secondary flow duct carries flow from the integral secondary flow blades as cooling air for components of the reverse flow turbine engine...|$|R

6000|$|But the sonorous {{voice of}} Torquil thundered out, [...] "Far eil air son Eachin!" [...] (Another for Hector!) {{and the two}} brethren who flanked their chief on each <b>side</b> <b>thrust</b> forward upon Henry, and, {{striking}} both at once, compelled him to keep the defensive.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} modelling and {{simulation of}} an underwater vehicle {{equipped with a}} collective and cyclic propeller (CCPP). A CCPP has been applied in helicopters and it generates both axial and <b>side</b> <b>thrusts</b> that move a helicopter in all directions. If axial and <b>side</b> <b>thrusts</b> of the CCPP are controlled as desired {{it is possible to}} apply the CCPP to an underwater vehicle. A new CCPP has been designed and fabricated for a torpedo shaped underwater vehicle. Captive experiments were conducted to quantify the performance of the CCPP. The paper reports recent development of an underwater vehicle equipped with the CCPP including design and fabrication of the experimental facility, conduct of experiments, modeling, performance of the CCPP and simulation of the vehicle propelled by the CCPP...|$|R

These have a rear wheel which usually carries weight and <b>side</b> <b>thrust</b> when plowing and {{sometimes}} {{the weight of the}} rear end of the plow when lifted. The front end of the plow is carried on the tractor lower or draft links.|$|R
50|$|The U.S. Army's Model 1913 cavalry saber had a large, basket-shaped hilt {{mounting}} a straight, double-edged, <b>thrusting</b> <b>blade</b> {{designed for use}} by heavy cavalry. Generally known as the “Patton” saber, after its designer Lieutenant (later General) George S. Patton, {{it may have been}} influenced by the British 1908 and 1912 Patterns. But Patton himself was predominantly influenced by French swordsmanship and French sword theory and design. Following the 1912 Olympics Patton went to France twice to study under French Master Swordsmen. His manual and cavalry sword use theories grew out of his training and experience in France.|$|R

50|$|Piston skirt durability: The piston {{must also}} contact {{the wall for}} cooling {{purposes}} but also must transfer the <b>side</b> <b>thrust</b> of the power stroke. Ports must be designed so that the piston can transfer these forces and heat to the cylinder wall while minimizing flex and shock to the piston.|$|R
25|$|On April 13, 1973, a Sabreliner NA-265-60 {{operated}} by Continental Airlines, N743R, crashed after takeoff at Montrose Airport in Montrose, Colorado following the uncommanded {{deployment of the}} port <b>side</b> <b>thrust</b> reverser. The two pilots, the only occupants of the aircraft, were killed and the aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and a post impact fire.|$|R
40|$|A {{document}} describes {{research into}} the problem of detecting a case breach formation {{at an early stage}} of a rocket flight. An inversion algorithm for case breach allocation is proposed and analyzed. It is shown how the case breach can be allocated at an early stage of its development by using the rocket sensor data and the output data from the control block of the rocket navigation system. The results are simulated with MATLAB/Simulink software. The efficiency of an inversion algorithm for a case breach location is discussed. The research was devoted to the analysis of the ARES-l flight during the first 120 seconds after the launch and early prediction of case breach failure. During this time, the rocket is propelled by its first-stage Solid Rocket Booster (SRB). If a breach appears in SRB case, the gases escaping through it will produce the (<b>side)</b> <b>thrust</b> directed perpendicular to the rocket axis. The <b>side</b> <b>thrust</b> creates torque influencing the rocket attitude. The ARES-l control system will compensate for the <b>side</b> <b>thrust</b> until it reaches some critical value, after which the flight will be uncontrollable. The objective of this work was to obtain the start time of case breach development and its location using the rocket inertial navigation sensors and GNC data. The algorithm was effective for the detection and location of a breach in an SRB field joint at an early stage of its development...|$|R
60|$|Thus having thrown his gauntlet, {{the brave}} Peter stuck {{a pair of}} horse-pistols in his belt, girded an immense powder-horn on his <b>side,</b> <b>thrust</b> his sound leg into a Hessian boot, and {{clapping}} his fierce little war-hat {{on the top of}} his head, paraded up and down in front of his house, determined to defend his beloved city to the last.|$|R
60|$|Denton tried again, but the barking still drowned his voice. The sound had {{a curious}} effect upon his blood. Odd disused {{emotions}} began to stir; his face changed as he shouted. He tried again; the barking seemed to mock him, and one dog danced a pace forward, bristling. Suddenly he turned, and uttering certain {{words in the}} dialect of the underways, words incomprehensible to Elizabeth, he made for the dogs. There was a sudden cessation of the barking, a growl and a snapping. Elizabeth saw the snarling head of the foremost dog, its white teeth and retracted ears, and the flash of the <b>thrust</b> <b>blade.</b> The brute leapt {{into the air and}} was flung back.|$|R
40|$|The {{rotational}} noise of model helicopter rotors in forward flight was studied in an anechoic wind tunnel. The parameters under study were the rotor <b>thrust</b> (<b>blade</b> loading), blade number and advance ratio. The separate effects of each parameter were {{identified with the}} other parameters being held constant. The directivity of the noise was also measured. Twelve sets of data for {{rotational noise}} {{as a function of}} frequency were compared with the theory of Lowson and Ollerhead. In general, the agreement is reasonably good, except for the cases of (1) low and high disk loadings, (2) the four bladed rotor, and (3) low advance ratios. The theory always under-estimates the rotational noise at high harmonics...|$|R

50|$|A tandem attack {{where two}} wrestlers {{stand in front}} of an {{opponent}} and hit him/her in the face/head with a high, <b>side</b> <b>thrust</b> kick, known as a superkick. The name can also refer to what is known as stereo superkicks when two wrestlers both perform superkicks to two different opponents at the same time. This move is used by The Young Bucks and The Usos.|$|R
