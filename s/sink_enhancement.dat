For the geologic and ocean storage options, CO 2 capture costs from another project were added to the costs of CO 2 storage estimated in this project to provide combined costs of CO 2 capture and storage. Combined costs of CO 2 capture and storage were compared with CO 2 <b>sink</b> <b>enhancement</b> costs on a life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) avoided basis. The CO 2 storage and <b>sink</b> <b>enhancement</b> options compared in this project differ greatly in the timing and permanence of CO 2 sequestration. In addressing the timing and permanence issue, a 100 -year planning horizon was assumed and the net present value of both costs and revenues was considered. The methods for comparing the economics of diverse CO 2 storage and <b>sink</b> <b>enhancement</b> options are overviewed and representative base-case costs of storage and <b>sink</b> <b>enhancement</b> options are compared...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present some {{numerical}} simulations with the MacGEM model {{to evaluate the}} consequences of the recent Marrakesh agreements and the defection of the USA for the Kyoto Protocol. MacGEM is a global marginal abatement cost model for carbon emissions from fossil fuel use based on the GEM-E 3 -World general equilibrium.

Carbon <b>sinks</b> <b>enhancement</b> activities enable Parties to fulfil their reduction commitment at lower compliance costs and cause the equilibrium permit price to decrease by 40 %.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present some {{numerical}} simulations with the MacGEM model {{to evaluate the}} consequences for the Kyoto Protocol on the reduction of greenhouse gases of the recent Bonn agreement and the nonratification by the USA. MacGEM is a global marginal abatement cost model for carbon emissions from fossil fuel use. Marginal abatement cost functions are estimated on data generated with the GEM-E 3 -World general equilibrium model {{under the assumption that}} abatement is produced in a cost efficient way in every individual country/region of the model. Nonparticipation of the USA causes the equilibrium carbon price in Annex B countries to fall by approximately 50 % since an important share of permit demand falls out and the global abatement objective is substantially eroded. With respect to the Bonn agreement, we focus on the Commitment Period Reserve (CPR) and carbon sinks. The CPR is a compliance mechanism requiring all Parties to maintain some fixed number of permits on their permit account. It entails a binding permit export ceiling for the former Soviet Union and central European countries. It raises the equilibrium carbon permit price by approximately 30 % and generates substantial monopoly rents for permit exporters. Finally, carbon <b>sinks</b> <b>enhancement</b> activities are accounted for by assuming that they represent free abatement options. These activities enable Parties to fulfil their reduction commitment at lower compliance costs and cause the equilibrium permit price to decreases even further. We conclude that the Bonn agreement has indeed eroded completely the Kyoto Protocol's emission targets but that it has the merit to have saved the international climate change negotiation framework. environmental economics; climate change; permit trade; Kyoto Protocol; carbon sinks...|$|R

40|$|The basic heat {{transfer}} characteristics of simulated microelectronic chips were investigated with direct immersion cooling in Freon-TF (R- 113). The basic heater was 4. 5 mm x 4. 5 mm electrically heated foil. The studies of plain heaters included natural convection, nucleate boiling, and critical heat flux. Water was {{included as a}} working fluid for natural convection. Ultrasonic agitation and heat sinks were studied as enhanced cooling methods;The height effect for single flush heaters agrees qualitatively with the conventional theory of natural convection, however, even the widest heaters have coefficients higher than predicted due to leading edge effects. The {{heat transfer}} coefficient increases with decreasing width. Correlations were developed for this effect which was as much as 150 %. The protruding heaters have about 15 % higher coefficients than the flush heaters;Data for natural convection were also obtained for in-line and staggered arrays of flush heaters with varying distance between heaters. Heat transfer coefficients for the upper heaters are below those for the lower heaters, with the differences diminishing as the vertical or horizontal spacings increase. For the protruding heaters, the upper heaters have higher coefficients than the lower heaters;There were negligible effects of width and protruding for fully developed boiling, as expected. Boiling inception occurred earlier with the top heaters than with the bottom heaters;The effects of heater height for critical heat fluxes agree generally with reported data. Critical heat flux increases with decreasing width. Correlations {{for the effects of}} height and width were developed;Turning to enhancement, ultrasonics was effective at low heat fluxes. Established boiling and critical heat flux were less affected;Small holes or small fins were machined in brass bars and copper studs (detachable) which were used as boiling heat <b>sinks.</b> <b>Enhancement</b> of the brass heat sinks was lower than that of the copper heat sinks due to the lower thermal conductivity.

40|$|Clean, {{safe and}} {{economical}} nuclear energy requires new materials capable of withstanding severe radiation damage. One strategy of imparting radiation resistance to solids is to incorporate into them a high density of solid-phase interfaces capable of absorbing and annihilating radiation-induced defects. Here {{we show that}} elastic interactions between point defects and semicoherent interfaces lead to a marked <b>enhancement</b> in interface <b>sink</b> strength. Our conclusions stem from simulations that integrate first principles, object kinetic Monte Carlo and anisotropic elasticity calculations. Surprisingly, the <b>enhancement</b> in <b>sink</b> strength is not due primarily to increased thermodynamic driving forces, but rather to reduced defect migration barriers, which induce a preferential drift of defects towards interfaces. The <b>sink</b> strength <b>enhancement</b> is highly sensitive to the detailed character of interfacial stresses, suggesting that ‘super-sink’ interfaces may be designed by optimizing interface stress fields.

40|$|Mitigation {{priorities}} {{in the forest}} sector should observe following sequence: REDD 2, <b>sink</b> <b>enhancement,</b> substitution of fossil fuel, and HWP 3. If accounting for HWP is not done properly, the risk for an incentive for deforestation is real. To curb the disadvantages of HWP, some debiting of non-sustainable forest management as currently achieved through Article 3. 4 of the Kyoto Protocol appears a necessity. Until effective REDD activities are implemented that provide true disincentives to deforestation, HWP may continue to create some risk of furthering deforestations in developing countries that are not constrained by the Kyoto Protocol. On the other hand, if HWP accounting is done properly {{as part of a}} LULUCF 4 scheme that minimizes risks of promoting deforestation and non-sustainable harvesting, HWP is to be welcomed as a means to help promoting the utilization of the climate-friendly, renewable natural resource wood.

40|$|The {{impacts of}} climate change and {{increasing}} atmospheric CO 2 concentration on the terrestrial uptake of carbon dioxide since 1860 in the Canadian province of British Columbia are estimated using the process-based Canadian Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (CTEM). Model simulations show that these two factors yield an enhanced carbon uptake of around 44 gC m − 2 yr − 1 (or equivalently 63 gC m − 2 yr − 1 over the province's forested area), during the 1980 s and 1990 s, and continuing into the 2000 s. About three-quarters of the simulated <b>sink</b> <b>enhancement</b> in our study compared to pre-industrial conditions is attributed to changing climate, {{and the rest is}} attributed to increase in CO 2 concentration.

40|$|The {{details on}} rules and {{modalities}} {{for the inclusion}} of forestry projects in the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) are one of the last non resolved implementation issues of the Kyoto Protocol. We examine in detail the implications of different policy decisions concerning the inclusion of CDM forestry <b>sink</b> <b>enhancement</b> projects in the first commitment period of the climate regime (2008 - 2012). Our analysis is based on the development of marginal forestry cost curves which are implemented into the carbon market model CERT. The latter is a partial equilibrium model of the international market for emissions permits under the Kyoto Protocol. The scenario analysis sheds light on the role of CDM forestry sinks in the climate regime, the effect of different policy scenarios on the carbon market price as well as the distribution of benefits and losses between countries. The results suggest, that the role of forestry projects in CDM in the first commitment period will be rather small. The countries mainly benefiting from the introduction of forestry in the CDM are the Annex B and the Latin American and African countries while China and the hot air holding countries will lose as compared to a purely energy based CDM...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a combined experimental and numerical investigation of single-phase water flow and heat transfer in serpentine rectangular microchannels {{embedded in a}} heated copper block. The performance of four different microchannel heat sink (MCHS) configurations are investigated experimentally, the first having an array of straight rectangular microchannels (SRMs), while the other have single (SPSMs), double (DPSMs) and triple path multi-serpentine rectangular microchannels (TPSMs). Three-dimensional conjugate heat transfer models are developed for both laminar and turbulent single-phase water flows {{in each of these}} MCHSs and the governing flow and energy equations solved numerically using finite elements. The numerical predictions of pressure drop (∆P) and average Nusselt number (〖Nu〗_avg) are in good agreement with experimental data, and indicated that the single path serpentine microchannel (SPSM) leads to a 35 % enhancement of the 〖Nu〗_avg at a volumetric flow rate of 0. 5 l/min and a 19 % reduction in total thermal resistance (R_th) compared to the conventional SRM heat <b>sink.</b> However, this <b>enhancement</b> is at the expense of a large (up to ten-fold) increase in ∆P compared to the SRM heat sink, so that a suitable compromise must be struck between heat transfer and pressure drop in practical MCHS designs...|$|R
40|$|The mixing effectiveness, i. e., the {{enhancement}} of molecular diffusion, of a flow can be quantified {{in terms of the}} suppression of concentration variance of a passive scalar sustained by steady sources and <b>sinks.</b> The mixing <b>enhancement</b> defined this way is the ratio of the RMS fluctuations of the scalar mixed by molecular diffusion alone to the (statistically steady-state) RMS fluctuations of the scalar density in the presence of stirring. This measure of the effectiveness of the stirring is naturally related to {{the enhancement}} factor of the equivalent eddy diffusivity over molecular diffusion, and depends on the Peclet number. It was recently noted that the maximum possible mixing enhancement at a given Peclet number depends as well on the structure of the sources and sinks. That is, the mixing efficiency, the effective diffusivity, or the eddy diffusion of a flow generally depends on the sources and sinks of whatever is being stirred. Here we present the results of particle-based simulations quantitatively confirming the source-sink dependence of the mixing enhancement as a function of Peclet number for a model flow.

40|$|Fullerenes {{and carbon}} {{nanotubes}} {{are the most}} important and promising nanomaterials to date. In order to obtain purified C 60 and C 70 from the soot of mixed fullerenes, an ordered mesoporous carbon, CMK- 3, was synthesized, characterized and used as adsorbent. It was found that the adsorption capacity of CMK- 3 was four times higher than that of activated carbon (AC). The reversibility of fullerene adsorption on CMK- 3 was also studied. In addition, another carbon nanomaterial with a specific nanostructure, aligned multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), were grown on both sides of a metallic or metal-coated substrate by water vapor-assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD). By manipulating various operating factors, the morphology and thickness of these carbon nanotube films could be adjusted. This technique was used to fabricate a thermal interface material, made up of a thin copper foil covered with Cr-Au-MWCNT on both sides. The Hot Disk® method was applied to measure the thermal conductivity of these CNT-TIMs. Results showed that a thicker copper foil substrate or CNT layer led to a lower overall thermal resistance. The laser flash method was used to study the performance of the bilayer aligned CNT-TIMs using two copper plates as heat source and <b>sink.</b> An <b>enhancement</b> in thermal conductivity of more than 290 % could be obtained under an applied contact pressure of 0. 01 MPa, as compared with two copper plates in direct contact. Meanwhile, the tribological properties of aligned CNT/fullerene-epoxy nanocomposites were also studied by nanoscratch, nanowear, and nano-indentation tests. Compared with neat epoxy, aligned CNT and fullerene-epoxy nanocomposites showed lower friction coefficient in scratch tests, a reduction of 38. 1 % and 26. 2 %, respectively. Finally, a method for fast forming of polymer/dispersed MWCNT nanocomposite hollow cylinders with microwave irradiation of polymer/MWCNT nanocomposite particles with a core-shell structure was achieved.

In our analysis we assess the impact of various accounting methods applied to large-scale <b>sink</b> <b>enhancement</b> projects, taking into account the partly temporary storage characteristics arising from such projects. We apply the various accounting methods to hypothetical large-scale Southern Ocean iron fertilization projects for different durations. From an economic perspective, issuing temporary carbon credits would provide the largest number of carbon credits at an early stage. This is equivalent to the existing tCER regulation under the Kyoto Protocol. Issuing temporary carbon credits for short-term ocean iron fertilization would also benefit the environment, as all credits would have to be replaced in the next commitment period. As some carbon will be stored permanently, this reduces atmospheric carbon concentration. Climate change Ocean iron fertilization Permanence Carbon accounting...|$|E

The inventory approach is a realistic method for estimating the organic carbon pool in China’s wetlands at the national scale. An updated data and inventory approach were used to estimate the amount of organic carbon stored in China’s wetlands. Primary results are as follows: (1) the organic carbon pool of China’s wetlands is between 5. 39 and 7. 25 Pg, accounting for 1. 3 %– 3. 5 % of the global level; (2) the estimated values and percentages of the organic carbon contained in the soil, water and vegetation pools in China’s wetlands are 5. 04 – 6. 19 Pg and 85. 4 %– 93. 5 %, 0. 22 – 0. 56 Pg and 4. 1 %– 7. 7 %, 0. 13 – 0. 50 Pg and 2. 4 %– 6. 9 %, respectively. The soil organic carbon pool of China’s wetlands is greater than our previous estimate of 3. 67 Pg, but is lower than other previous estimates of 12. 20 and 8 – 10 Pg.

40|$|To {{stay within}} the 2 °C {{temperature}} increase target for climate change calls for ambitious emission reduction targets already for the 2012 - 2020 compliance period. Cost-efficiency is a crucial criterion for the enforcement of such ambitious targets, requiring analyses of all possible abatement options. Among others, enhancing the oceanic carbon sink by ocean iron fertilization (OIF) could be such an option but is currently not seriously considered due to its potentially adverse side effects. In our analysis we consider short-term large-scale OIF modeling experiments for a Post-Kyoto compliance problem to assess the economic prospects of OIF. Our analysis reveals that the critical unit costs per net ton of CO 2 sequestered by OIF are {{in a range of}} 21. 9 to 27. 7 USD (price level 2000) assuming that the current limitations regarding the use of carbon credits generated in low cost countries and from forestation is completely relaxed. The critical unit costs are defined as those that would make an emitter indifferent between various abatement options. We are also able to show that already seven years of OIF in the area of 30 ° south provide the same amount of credits equivalent to a global forestation project for the duration of 20 years. Over all, our results indicate that OIF should be considered as an abatement option, but, further research, especially on adverse side effects, is neededclimate change, <b>sink</b> <b>enhancement,</b> ocean iron fertilization, CO 2 market, emission trading...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions scenarios that form the analytical backbone for other contributions to this Special Issue. We first describe the motivation behind this scenario exercise and introduce the main scenario features and characteristics, in both qualitative and quantitative terms. Altogether, we analyze three baseline scenarios of different socio-economic and technological developments that are assumed not to include any explicit climate policies. We then impose a range of climate stabilization targets on these baseline scenarios and analyze in detail the feasibility, costs and uncertainties of meeting a range of different climate stabilization targets in accordance with Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The scenarios were developed by the IIASA Integrated Assessment Modeling Framework that encompasses detailed representations of the principal GHG-emitting sectors - energy, industry, agriculture, and forestry. The main analytical findings from our analysis focus on the implications of salient uncertainties (associated with scenario baselines and stabilization targets), on feasibility and costs of climate stabilization efforts, and on the choice of appropriate portfolios of emissions abatement measures. We further analyze individual technological options with regards to their aggregated cumulative contribution toward emissions mitigation during the 21 st century as well as their deployment over time. Our results illustrate that the energy sector will remain by far the largest source of GHG emissions and hence remain the prime target of emissions reduction. Ultimately, this may lead to a complete restructuring of the global energy system. Climate mitigation could also significantly change the relative economics of traditional versus new, more climate friendly products and services. This is especially the case within the energy system, which accounts for the largest share of emissions reductions, but it is also the case in the agriculture and forestry sectors, where emissions reduction and <b>sink</b> <b>enhancement</b> measures are relatively more modest...|$|E
40|$|The {{agriculture}} sector {{dominates the}} economies of most sub-Saharan countries, contributing {{about one-third of the}} region’s GDP, accounting for forty percent of the export, and employing about two-thirds of the economically active population. Moreover, some soils in sub-Saharan Africa could, by providing sinks for carbon sequestration, {{play an important role in}} managing global climate change. Improvements in agricultural techniques and land use practices could lead to higher agricultural productivity and accumulate soil carbon. Hence, soil carbon sequestration could produce local economic income as well as social and other benefits in Africa. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) established in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol is designed to give developed countries with high domestic abatement cost access to low-cost greenhouse gas abatement projects in developing countries, and to benefit developing countries selling projects to investors in developed countries. It is presently unclear whether the CDM will provide credit for <b>sink</b> <b>enhancement</b> and permit broader sink activities. Unfortunately, few cost estimates of soil carbon sequestration strategies presently exist. While these costs are uncertain and all input costs have not been estimated, manure-based projects in small-holdings in Kenya could increase maize yield significantly and sequester one ton of soil carbon for a net cost of - US$ 806. Clearly, such projects would be very attractive economically. There is presently an urgent need to launch useful long-term (> 10 years) field experiments and demonstration projects in Africa. Existing data are not readily comparable, it is uncertain how large amounts of carbon could be sequestered, findings are site-specific, and it is unclear how well the sites represent wider areas. To develop CDM projects, it is important that experimental trials generate reliable and comparable data.

40|$|Although the U. N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) {{has been}} signed and {{ratified}} by 168 countries, global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have increased substantially since the 1992 Rio Summit. In both developing countries (DCs) and industrialized countries (ICs), {{there has been}} a need to find mechanisms to facilitate environmentally sound mitigation strategies. This need {{led to the formation of}} Activities Implemented Jointly (AIJ) at the first Conference-of the Parties (COP) in 1995. In Article 4 A, para 2 D, the COP established an AIJ pilot phase in which Annex I (IC) countries would enter into agreements to implement activities jointly with non-Annex I parties. DCs would engage in AIJ on a purely voluntary basis and all AIJ projects should be compatible with and supportive of national environment and development goals. AIJ does not imply GHG reduction commitments by DCs. Neither do all projects undertaken during the pilot phase qualify as a fulfillment of current commitment s of Annex I parties under the COP. The current pilot phase for AIJ ends in the year 2000, a date which may be extended. Current AIJ activities are largely focused on the energy sector. The Nordic countries, for example, feel that the most important potential areas for cooperation in AIJ are fuel conversion, more effective energy production, increased energy efficiency, and reforms in energy-intensive industry (Nordic Council of Ministers, 1995). Denmark does not want to include non-energy sector projects such as carbon <b>sink</b> <b>enhancement</b> projects in the pilot phase (Nordic Council of Ministers, 1995). However, other countries, including the US, have already funded a number of forestry sector projects (Development Alternatives, 1997). Moreover, energy-sector projects involving high technology or capital-intensive technology are often a source of controversy between DCs and ICs regarding the kind of technology transferred and sharing of costs and benefits. Further, the pilot phase provide s an opportunity for capacity-building and learning about methods of planning, implementation, and monitoring of GHG abatement in land-based non-energy sector projects...|$|E
