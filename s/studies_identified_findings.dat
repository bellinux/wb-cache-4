The current <b>study</b> <b>identified</b> similar <b>findings,</b> specifically challenges between oneself and the organization, oneself and the cultural context in the HC, and internally within oneself. All of these experiences shared a core of personal conflict. The struggle {{was a result of}} the individual’s conception of their ethics interacting with the complex institutional, cultural, and personal environments in HCs. Studies have shown that HCPs who have encountered ethical dilemmas experienced symptoms of anxiety, distress, uncertainty, and remorse (Hunt et al. 2011; Nilsson et al. 2011). The findings in this study are strikingly similar. Participants elaborated on a variety of emotional suffering.

Background: Use of complementary and alternative medicine during pregnancy is a crucial healthcare issue. Recent discussion has identified {{the need to develop}} an integrated approach to maternity care. However, {{there is a lack of}} understanding of attitudes and behaviours of maternity care professionals towards these treatments. Data sources: A database search was conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL, Health Source, AMED and Maternity and Infant Care for the period 1999 – 2009. Review methods: An integrative review method was employed. Studies were selected if they reported results from primary data collection on professional practice/referral or knowledge/attitude towards complementary and alternative medicine by obstetricians, midwives and allied maternity care providers.

A single review of psychological morbidity was identified with significant limitations in reporting the search process (White & Hunt, 1997). Search criteria were systematically applied to electronic databases. After consideration of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 11 relevant <b>studies</b> were <b>identified.</b> <b>Findings</b> indicated psychological morbidity is present, although has not been compared to the general population so conclusions must be interpreted with caution. Psychological morbidity was not a primary focus of the studies and the psychometric adequacy of the measures used has been drawn into question.

The aim of this systematic review was to determine whether OT interventions improve outcome for children with {{cerebral palsy}} (CP). METHODS: An extensive search in MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, AMED and SCISEARCH was performed. Studies with controlled and uncontrolled designs were included. Six intervention categories were distinguished and individually analysed using a best-evidence synthesis. This synthesis is based on the type of design, the methodological quality, the type of outcome measures and the statistical significance of the findings. RESULTS: Seventeen studies were included in this review, seven of which were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). One RCT had a high methodological quality. The analyses resulted in insufficient evidence of the efficacy of occupational therapy in all intervention categories, due to the low methodological quality of studies presenting statistically nonsignificant results.

Environmental hardship has led to a decline in agricultural production and food insecurity, political quagmire by countries over carbon emissions, as well as threats to lives in forms of skin diseases and respiratory problems. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and carbon dioxide (CO 2) are associated to unclean energy usage worldwide, contributing to environmental damage and climate change. Again, South Africa is faced with electricity crises for nearly a decade. To surmount the twin challenges of environmental sustainability and energy security, this Southern Africa country adopted a green economy strategy, of which green (renewable) energy is the thrust of the approach. It has proposed a green energy policy, which has generated controversy and contestations from the members of the public and stakeholders alike. The controversy generated by the policy is inextricable linked to lack of participation by the relevant stakeholders in crafting the proposed clean energy policy. The purpose of this research is to investigate factors leading to lack of inclusivity and participation in the proposed implementation of a green energy strategy in South Africa. Following literature review, background studies, as well analyses of qualitative in-depth interviews, the <b>study</b> <b>identified</b> key <b>findings</b> that speak to the reasons for lack of inclusivity and participation in the governance of the green energy in South Africa.

40|$|Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is {{commonly}} used for agricultural and domestic applications, and its contamination is widely detected in environmental media, and in {{a broad spectrum of}} field crops, fruits and vegetables. CPF exposure causes many adverse effects on human health including hepatoxicity, neurotoxicity and endocrine disruption. However, few studies have been conducted thus far to investigate the potential influence of CPF exposure on iron metabolism at concentrations that do not trigger significant cell death. Iron metabolism is concertedly governed by the hepcidin-ferroportin axis, where hepcidin is the central hormone involved in the regulation of iron absorption and release, while ferroportin is the only known iron exporter that functions by iron egress from cells. In the present study, we demonstrated that CPF treatment at a non-toxic concentration greatly enhanced ferroportin gene transcription in human macrophage THP- 1 cells. CPF significantly inhibited hepcidin expression in human hepatocyte HepG 2 cells. As a result, the intracellular labile iron pool (LIP) was largely reduced in THP- 1 and HepG 2 cells. The combined data of this <b>study</b> <b>identified</b> a novel <b>finding</b> of CPF that disrupts iron homeostasis by altering ferroportin and hepcidin expression. These findings would be useful in understanding the biological effects of CPF exposure, especially under relatively low and non-toxic doses...|$|R
40|$|This article reports {{research}} from a descriptive <b>study,</b> <b>identifying</b> parents' and teachers' views of young children's social behaviour. This {{study was conducted}} in Singapore with 26 respondents, 13 early year's teachers and 13 parents, five from an international school and 21 from a Catholic school. Using qualitative thematic analysis, the researcher revealed three key themes influencing the development of young children's social behaviour: differences across generations, quality of relationships and mechanisms of socialisation. The intention of this study was not to compare the settings but to record the perceptions of respondents as they reflected on factors influencing young children's social behaviour in Singapore. Implications of the findings are discussed with future research <b>identified.</b> <b>Findings</b> will inform a larger study examining the implementation of social learning curriculums across three early years' schools in Singapore...|$|R
