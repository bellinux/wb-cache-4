This 20 mile (32 km) section {{from the end of}} the Llanfairpwll bypass to Holyhead Harbour was constructed as Private Finance Initiative scheme where the builders, a Carillion / John Laing joint venture, earn a <b>shadow</b> <b>toll</b> based on usage and lane availability. They also have to maintain the road for the extended period of their <b>shadow</b> <b>toll</b> agreement. When travelling eastbound along this section there are fine views of Snowdonia.

50|$|First {{proposed}} by the UK Government in 1993, <b>shadow</b> <b>tolls</b> {{have been widely used}} in the UK and also to a more limited extent in other countries, including Belgium, Canada, Finland, Netherlands, Spain and the United States. Portugal introduced schemes in 1999 but replaced these with the public tolls in 2004.|$|R
5000|$|Most of the Portuguese {{motorways}} are tolled, {{although there}} are also some non-tolled highways, mostly in urban areas, like those of Greater Lisbon and Greater Oporto. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Government of Portugal created seven <b>shadow</b> <b>toll</b> concessions, the SCUT toll ( [...] , no costs for the user). In those concessions it were included more than 900 km of motorways and highways, some of them already built, others which were built in the following years. However, due to economical and political reasons, the <b>shadow</b> <b>toll</b> concept was abolished between 2010 and 2011, with electronic toll equipment being installed in these motorways, to charge their users. Having only electronic tolls, former SCUT motorways can now only be used by vehicles equipped with electronic payment devices or vehicles registered in the system.|$|E

It runs at an average distance of 13.5 km from the Puerta del Sol. It is managed by the central government. Its construction was financed using a <b>shadow</b> <b>toll</b> system.|$|E
50|$|The use of <b>shadow</b> <b>tolls</b> in the UK {{has reduced}} over time with PFI funded project {{payments}} being made {{based primarily on}} the availability of the road, and not on the number of vehicles using it.

50|$|In {{the first}} six months the overdue toll fees of {{unregistered}} road users accrued to R1 billion, and the Gauteng government acknowledged the dissatisfaction of motorists. Its transport MEC, Ismail Vadi, however clarified that e-tolling in the province will remain, though a provincial fuel levy, provincial tax or <b>shadow</b> <b>tolling</b> may be considered as alternatives for future upgrade projects. Gauteng relied on significant fuel levy increases up to 2014.|$|R
30|$|Recently, a {{new trend}} is {{emerging}} based {{on the use of}} video processing. The use of vision systems is becoming an alternative to the mentioned technologies. Their main advantage, as well as radar and laser systems one, is that their cost is much lower than ILDs, while its ability to count and classify is potentially the same. Moreover, as it only implies image processing, no radiation is emitted to the road, so they can be considered completely non-intrusive. Nevertheless, vision-based systems should still be considered as in a prototype stage until they are able to achieve correct detection and classification rates high enough for real implementation in free <b>tolling</b> or <b>shadow</b> <b>tolling</b> systems. In this article, a new vision-based system is introduced, which represents a real alternative to traditional intrusive sensing systems for <b>shadow</b> <b>tolling</b> applications, since it provides the required levels of accuracy and robustness to the detection and classification tasks. It uses a single camera and a processor that captures images and processes them to generate estimates of the vehicles circulating on a road stretch.|$|R
50|$|A <b>shadow</b> <b>toll</b> is a {{contractual}} {{payment made}} by a government per driver using a road to a private company that operates a road built or maintained using private finance initiative funding. Payments are based, at least in part, {{on the number of}} vehicles using a section of road, often over a 20- to 30-year period. The shadow tolls or per vehicle fees are paid directly to the company without intervention or direct payment from the users.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, EISER took a {{stake in}} two Spanish {{transport}} interchange projects called Concesiones de Intercambiadores de Transporte.

At this time EISER also purchased {{a stake in}} two long-term <b>shadow</b> <b>toll</b> road concessions in Spain, collectively known as Autovías de Peaje en Sombra. The first, Autovía del Noroeste, is a 62 km highway in the Murcia region, while Autovía del Turia is a 52.9 km highway in the Valencia region.|$|E
50|$|The use of <b>shadow</b> <b>toll</b> as a {{means of}} funding has been controversial. The group of United Left in the Assembly of Madrid argues that is a {{significant}} increase for public spending. According to a report carried out, the cost in 25 years of the work of the highway would amount to 1,838 million euros , while direct execution had not exceeded 600 million. The responsible Ministry, ruled by the Popular Party , defended the system and said that the own Ministry of Public Works planned to use it.|$|E
30|$|This type {{of systems}} must meet {{a set of}} {{requirements}} for its implementation. Namely, on the one hand, they must operate real time, i.e. they must acquire the information (through its corresponding sensing platform), process it, {{and send it to}} a control center in time to acquire, process, and submit new events. On the other hand, these systems must have a high reliability in all situations (day, night, adverse weather conditions). Finally, if we focus on <b>shadow</b> <b>tolling</b> systems, then the system is considered to be working if it is not only capable of counting vehicles, but also classifying them according to their dimensions or weight.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{empirical evidence}} on the economic and budgetary effects of the recent investments in toll-free highways in Portugal, the so-called SCUTS, {{in an effort to}} bring some clarity to the current policy debate on these highways. This debate is centered {{on the issue of the}} financial sustainability of these highways for the public sector and is derived from the fact that their financing through public-private partnerships and <b>shadow</b> <b>tolls</b> involves regular payments from the public budget to the private firms operating them. In this context, the introduction of tolls has been suggested as a mechanism to alleviate possible budgetary pressures. Our first main conclusion is that investments in SCUTS have positive economic effects in all regions of the country. Furthermore, we find that regional spillovers account for about threequarters of the total effects of these investments. A paradigmatic case is Lisbon, a region that captures the greatest share of these effects without any investments having actually occurred in the region itself. Our second main conclusion is that investments in SCUTS do not seem to generate problems of financial sustainability for the public budget. We estimate that for all SCUTS, the equilibrium tax rate, i. e., the rate that would balance the tax revenues induced by these highways and the <b>shadow</b> <b>tolls</b> the government has to pay, is lower than the effective tax rate for the economy. As a corollary and from a policy standpoint our results suggest that the introduction of tolls is questionable from a conceptual perspective due to the magnitude of spillovers and seems to be unnecessary from a financial perspective. road infrastructures, regional spillovers, financial sustainability, SCUTS, Portugal. ...|$|R
50|$|Although {{generally}} state-owned and financed, {{there are}} some autovías which are actually built and maintained by private companies, such as Pamplona-Logroño A-12. The company assumes the building costs and the Autonomous Community where they are located (in the given example, Navarre) pays a yearly per-vehicle fee to the company based upon usage statistics. This fee is called a <b>shadow</b> <b>toll</b> (peaje en la sombra). The system {{can be regarded as}} a way for the Government to finance the construction of new roads without any initial outlay of money. Also, since payment starts after the road is finished, there are fewer construction delays in comparison with regular state-owned construction.|$|E

The June 7, 2012, the Regional President Esperanza Aguirre announced before the end of 2012 this highway would become direct toll due to high maintenance costs as well as due to economic problems of the regional government. The cost to the Madrid government is 8 cents per kilometer and car, and 2.64 euros for each vehicle passing through all the way.|$|E
50|$|The section between Honiton and Exeter in East Devon was {{upgraded}} in 1999 to dual carriageway, giving quicker {{access to}} Exeter International Airport.

Archaeological investigations during the work found a Roman cavalry garrison and later settlement at Pomeroy Wood. There were several protests by environmentalists during construction and the particular nature of the DBFO scheme, with a long-lasting occupation of sites on the planned route, focused around Fairmile.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the returns to the investors and the state in private finance of road infrastructure. It uses an empirical case of the E 4 Helsinki-Lahti road, which was built in 1995 - 1999 in Finland as the first real PPP-project. Design/methodology/approach – The analysis adopts an approach based on cash flow modelling of the project and the analyses show how the cash flows are formed and divided between the various stakeholders. The pure cash flow based approach to compare the economics of PPP vs traditional procurement of road infrastructure projects produced results that pose challenges to the logic, and pros and cons of <b>shadow</b> <b>toll</b> PPPs. Findings – The analysis shows that potential win-win situations are hard to find in <b>shadow</b> <b>toll</b> arrangements. This is largely due to the different discount rates used by investors and state. It is argued that the state does not include all the true costs in its appraisal of projects. Private investors, in principle and as a rule, price all of the relevant risks and uncertainties of which they are cognisant. Originality/value – The paper presents an analytical cash flow model that can be applied a wider range of PPP projects than simply to <b>shadow</b> <b>toll</b> roads. The paper contributes to the discussion on the viability of PPPs in different contexts...|$|E

30|$|This article {{introduces}} a 3 D vehicle tracking {{system in a}} traffic surveillance environment devised for <b>shadow</b> <b>tolling</b> applications. It has been specially designed to operate in real time with high correct detection and classification rates. The system is capable of providing accurate and robust results in challenging road scenarios, with rain, traffic jams, casted shadows in sunny days at sunrise and sunset times, etc. A Bayesian inference method {{has been designed to}} generate estimates of multiple variable objects entering and exiting the scene. This framework allows easily mixing different nature information, gathering in a single step observation models, calibration, motion priors and interaction models. The inference of results is carried out with a novel optimization procedure that generates estimates of the maxima of the posterior distribution combining concepts from Gibbs and slice sampling. Experimental tests have shown excellent results for traffic-flow video surveillance applications {{that can be used to}} classify vehicles according to their length, width, and height. Therefore, this vision-based system can be seen as a good substitute to existing inductive loop detectors.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to study the {{existence}} of excessive returns in the <b>Shadow</b> <b>tolls</b> Road projects (SCUTs) in Portugal, exploiting the feasibility of renegotiating the contracts providing excessive rents at the government’s benefice. The study analyses evidence on excessive returns by using a profitability assessment methodology, consisting in comparing an accurate profitability measure with a suitable benchmark. For the SCUTs showing evidence on excessive returns, renegotiations scenarios where these returns are readjusted to the “fair” level are constructed and simulated. We find that four of the seven SCUTs in Portugal – Interior Norte, Algarve, Beiras Litoral e Alta and Norte Litoral – show evidence on excessive returns for the period after the new payment model implementation (in 2010). We further estimate that renegotiating the State payments for these SCUTs permits savings of € 837 Million in the aggregate SCUTs payments’ present value. We also find that such levels of cut in the State payments lower the debt service coverage ratio of certain projects below the security level. Imposing renegotiations where {{the capacity of the}} firms to pay the debt is not threaten reduce the value of savings to € 631 Million...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of transport infrastructure {{is critical to}} boost the economic growth in developing countries. However, transport infrastructure is capital-intensive and public funds are limited. In this context, private sector participation {{should be encouraged to}} decrease the burden of the governments in terms of financing. Indonesia is the fourth most populated country in the world and its economy has been steadily growing during the last decade. Nevertheless, the country faces several challenges due to the underdeveloped and irregular distribution of transport infrastructure around the country. The Master Plan for Acceleration and Expansion of Indonesia's Economic Development (MP 3 EI) includes the construction of thousands of kilometers of roads. PPPs are expected {{to play an important role}} in the implementation of this Plan. In this sense, the government holds a proactive approach and as a result, a regulatory framework for PPPs has been established. The main objective of this dissertation is to determine whether toll road projects are economically and financially viable in Indonesia and, consistently define the most suitable financing schemes to be adopted. A Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) has been conducted in order to assess the economic welfare gain, as well as to conclude whether this projects would be commercially feasible. One of the most attractive sections of the Trans Sumatra toll road, in terms of traffic forecast and initial investment, has been analyzed for this purpose. The relevant economic impacts have been identified, monetized, and discounted using a certain social discount rate to determine the economic performance. Moreover, all the financial outflows and inflows have been calculated and discounted using a certain financial discount rate to establish the cash flow streams. The economic and financial indicators obtained show that even toll roads socio-economically desirable are financially unfeasible. Hence, mixed financing schemes have been proposed including public incentives to attract private investors. A Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) agreement between public and private parties is considered the more appropriate model to develop toll roads in Indonesia. It is essential to identify the risks related to the project; paying special attention to which party – the public or the private sector – will be mainly responsible for the planning and implementation of the mitigation measures and the management of such risks. Several financing schemes with different initial investment distributions, responsibilities, and risk allocations have been proposed. The conclusion drawn is that major initial investment covered by the private or public party implies greater financial profitability for the private party and smaller incurred cost for the public party respectively. However, it should be considered that more responsibility and financial risk will be assumed too. Based on the proposed schemes, the {{development of}} toll roads in Indonesia would be commercially viable under BOT financing schemes sharing the initial investment between public and private parties and establishing <b>shadow</b> <b>tolls.</b> An agreement regarding the portion of initial investment covered by each party and the <b>shadow</b> <b>tolls</b> compensation should be clearly defined in the PPP contract...|$|R
