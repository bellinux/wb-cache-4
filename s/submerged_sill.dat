40|$|A {{consolidation}} work, {{which may}} be called a <b>submerged</b> <b>sill,</b> is constructed across a river channelin order to prevent the river bed from being lowered due to a dam construction. The stability of itsfoundation should not be threatened by the local scour downstream of the sill. In this study, char-acteristics of the scouring process downstream of a consolidation work are discussed experimentallyand analytically, using a simplified flow model. The flow downstream of a <b>submerged</b> <b>sill</b> has towpatterns; submerged jet and undular jump. In the state of submerged jet, the main flow is deflecteddownwards and sweeps along the bed with a roller near the water surface. On the other hand, in thestate of undular jump, the main flow is shifted to the water surface and a roller is formed near thescour hole bed. These two flow patterns appear alternately in the scouring process. Modifyingthese two flow patterns under some assumptions based on the experimental facts, the distribution ofthe bed shear stress in the scour hole is estimated and the variation of the scour depth with time andplace is simulated by solving numerically the equation of continuity of the bed sand under the non-equilibrium state of sand discharge...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: As {{one of the}} {{undergraduate}} students chosen for the project, I was given the task of researching a turbulent density-stratified flow over a <b>submerged</b> <b>sill.</b> I found that more mixing at the interface between the two flows was proportional to {{the height of the}} surge-like instabilities that formed at the boundary. I also found that the ratio of the average flow in the upper layer to the average total above the sill was a good indicator of entrainment rate. Unrelated to the research itself, this experience allowed me a great opportunity {{to learn more about the}} Europeans and increased my respect for other students and researchers fro...|$|E
40|$|The <b>submerged</b> <b>Sill</b> in the Messina Strait, {{which is}} located {{at a depth of}} - 81 m m. s. l., {{represents}} the only possibile connection between Calabria and Sicily during the last lowstand, when the sea level was at about - 126 m m. s. l. This multidisciplinary research aim at documenting times and modes the bridge between Calabria and Sicily was emerged, during the last 40 ka BP. The analysis carried out on morphobathymetric, lithological and relative sea level change (both isostatic and tectonic) data allow to hypothesize the continental bridge emerged at least between 21. 5 ka and 20 ka cal BP. Moreover, considering erosion processes due to very strong marine currents, it could be emerged for a longer time span. This hypothesis is supported by anthropological and mammalofauna data, together with 14 C dating on Equus hydruntinus from San Teodoro Cave. © 2012 Società Geologica Italiana, Roma...|$|E
40|$|A recent {{investigation}} of flow through bedrock canyons of the Fraser River revealed that plunging flows occur where the canyons are laterally constrained and have low width-to-depth ratios. An experimental investigation was undertaken {{to reproduce the}} plunging flow fields observed in the Fraser canyons and to {{explore the influence of}} morphological controls on the occurrence and relative strength of plunging flow in bedrock canyons. Observations show that the plunging flow structure can be produced by accelerating the flow at the canyon entrance either over <b>submerged</b> <b>sills</b> or through lateral constrictions {{at the top of a}} scour pool entrance slope. The occurrence and strength of plunging flow into a scour pool can be enhanced by sill height, amount of lateral constriction, pool entrance slope, discharge, and reduced width-to-depth ratio. Plunging flow greatly enhances the potential for incision to occur along the channel bed and is an extreme departure from the assumptions of steady, uniform flow in bedrock incision models, highlighting the need for improved formulations that account for fluid flow...|$|R
40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{problem of}} wave-trapping above a <b>submerged</b> round <b>sill</b> was first analyzed by Longuet-Higgins (1967) {{on the basis}} of a linear shallow-water theory. The large responses predicted by the theory were, however, not well borne out by the experiments of Barnard, Pritchard and Provis (1981) and this has motivated a more detailed study of the problem. A full, linear theory for both inviscid and weakly viscous fluid, without any shallow-water assumptions, is presented here. It reveals important limitations on the use of shallow-water theory and the reasons for them. In particular, while the qualitative features of wave-trapping are similar to those of shallow-water theory, the nearly-resonant frequencies differ significantly, and since the resonances are narrow, the observed amplitudes at a given frequency differ greatly. The geometry is strongly indicative of long waves and the dispersion relation appears quite consistent with that, but the part of the motion at wave numbers that are not small has, despite the small amplitude, a substantial effect on the response to excitation...|$|R
40|$|The {{work has}} been {{supported}} by European Community’s Seventh Framework Programme through the grant to {{the budget of the}} Integrating Activity HYDRALAB IV within the Transnational Access Activities, Contract No. 261520. Results are presented from a series of large-scale experiments investigating the internal and near-bed dynamics of bi-directional stratified flows with a net-barotropic component across a <b>submerged,</b> trapezoidal, <b>sill</b> obstruction. High-resolution velocity and density profiles are obtained {{in the vicinity of the}} obstruction to observe internal-flow dynamics under a range of parametric forcing conditions (i. e. variable saline and fresh water volume fluxes; density differences; sill obstruction submergence depths). Detailed synoptic velocity fields are measured across the sill crest using 2 D particle image velocimetry, while the density structure of the two-layer exchange flows is measured using micro-conductivity probes at several sill locations. These measurements are designed to aid qualitative and quantitative interpretation of the internal-flow processes associated with the lower saline intrusion layer blockage conditions, and indicate that the primary mechanism for this blockage is mass exchange from the saline intrusion layer due to significant interfacial mixing and entrainment under dominant, net-barotropic, flow conditions in the upper freshwater layer. This interfacial mixing is quantified by considering both the isopycnal separation of vertically-sorted density profiles across the sill, as well as calculation of corresponding Thorpe overturning length scales. Analysis of the synoptic velocity fields and density profiles also indicates that the net exchange flow conditions remain subcritical (G < 1) across the sill for all parametric conditions tested. An analytical two-layer exchange flow model is then developed to include frictional and entrainment effects, both of which are needed to account for turbulent stresses and saline entrainment into the upper freshwater layer. The experimental results are used to validate two key model parameters: (1) the internal-flow head loss associated with boundary friction and interfacial shear; and (2) the mass exchange from the lower saline layer into the upper fresh layer due to entrainment.

40|$|International audienceResults are {{presented}} {{from a series}} of experiments investigating the internal and near-bed dynamics of restricted net exchange flows across a <b>submerged</b> <b>sill</b> obstruction. Experimental measurements focused on obtaining high-resolution velocity and density profiles {{in the vicinity of the}} obstruction to observe and quantify both interfacial mixing and boundary layer processes under a range of parametric forcing conditions (i. e. variable saline and fresh water flow rates; density differences; water levels). Detailed synoptic velocity fields were also measured across the obstruction through particle image velocimetry (PIV) to aid qualitative and quantitative interpretation of these internal and near-bed flow processes, with a focus on defining the specific parametric conditions under which saline intrusions could become arrested through erosion of the intrusion nose at the bed boundary by the freshwater outflow layer. In this regard, it is anticipated that the study findings will provide an important step towards achieving improved representation of interfacial mixing and boundary layer processes within semi-enclosed estuaries and fjords, which are often poorly represented in current numerical models...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the discovery of}} eight submerged deltas (- 19 to - 45 m), the first documented submerged boulder barricade, a <b>submerged</b> <b>sill</b> platform and spits {{off the coast of}} Cumberland Peninsula, eastern Baffin Island, NU. The geomorphic characteristics of these features in relation to contemporaneous sea-level are presented and compared with the modern shore-zone. The submerged boulder barricade at Qikiqtarjuaq in the west indicates a - 16 m sea level that isolated Broughton Channel from Baffin Bay to the north, changing the coastal dynamics from those observed at present. A shoreline deeper than - 50 m planed off the fiord-mouth sill in Akpait Fiord and formed spits at - 50 m and - 30 m present depth. These features define a submerged shoreline gradient of 0. 35 m/km to the east across northeastern Cumberland Peninsula. The linear gradient sediment supply requirements for delta formation suggest a synchronous lowstand, bracketed by ice margins and sourced from glacial outwash between 11. 8 - 8. 5 ka. This confirms the submergence trend hypothesized for eastern Cumberland Peninsula (Dyke, 1979) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{time and}} mode of human {{dispersal}} onto Mediterranean islands is a hotly debated question. A multidisciplinary approach combining palaeogeographical reconstructions with biological and archeological evidence is of crucial importance to acquire information on island colonization by Homo sapiens during the Late Pleistocene. New evidence from Sicily and Sardinia demonstrates that, despite being {{present in the}} Italian peninsula at least from 43 ka BP, H. sapiens reached the two largest Mediterranean islands no earlier than the LGM. During the Late Pleistocene, a <b>submerged</b> <b>Sill</b> in the Strait of Messina connected Sicily to Europe. Geological, stratigraphic and oceanographic {{data suggest that the}} bridge emerged for at least 1, 500 years between 21. 5 and 20 ka cal BP. This hypothesis is supported by a radiocarbon date on an Equus hydruntinus specimen from San Teodoro cave 21 ka cal BP and archaeological data suggesting that H. sapiens did not arrive to Sicily much earlier than 17. 5 ka cal BP. The Egadi Islands, off western Sicily, were not colonized before then either by humans or by terrestrial animals with poor swimming ability. The hypothesis of a Mid-Pleistocene dispersal on Sardinia by hominins is questionable. H. sapiens remains have been found in early Holocene deposits at Corbeddu cave and S Omu e S Orku respectively 8. 7 and 8. 5 ka BP, while further evidence is required to support the hypothesis of a presence during the LGM. A study of a human tooth from Dragonara cave, and a reappraisal of the geological-environmental context of this site provide fresh data for debate, confirming the presence of H. sapiens on the island when the minimum distance between Corsica and the mainland coasts of Italy was about 15 km. The palaeogeographic reconstruction allows us to evaluate the navigation exploits of Sardinian settlers, when hunter-gatherers were colonizing Sicily on foot...|$|E
40|$|The <b>submerged</b> <b>sill</b> in the Strait of Messina, {{which is}} located today at a minimum depth of 81 m below sea level (bsl), {{represents}} the only land connection between Sicily and mainland Italy (and thus Europe) during the last lowstand when the sea level locally stood at about 126 m bsl. Today, the sea crossing to Sicily, although it is less than 4 km at the narrowest point, faces hazardous sea conditions, made famous by the myth of Scylla and Charybdis. Through a multidisciplinary research project, we document the timing and mode of emergence of this land connection during the last 40 kyr. The integrated analysis takes into consideration morphobathymetric and lithological data, and relative sea-level change (both isostatic and tectonic), resulting in the hypothesis that a continental land bridge lasted for at least 500 years between 21. 5 and 20 cal ka BP. The emergence may have occurred over an even longer time span if one allows for seafloor erosion by marine currents that have lowered the seabed since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Modelling of palaeotidal velocities shows that sea crossings when sea level was lower than present would have faced even stronger and more hazardous sea currents than today, supporting the hypothesis that earliest human entry into Sicily most probably took place on foot during the period when the sill emerged as dry land. This hypothesis is compared with an analysis of Pleistocene vertebrate faunas in Sicily and mainland Italy, including a new radiocarbon date on bone collagen of an Equus hydruntinus specimen from Grotta di San Teodoro (23 – 21 cal ka BP), the dispersal abilities of the various animal species involved, particularly their swimming abilities, and the Palaeolithic archaeological record, all of which support the hypothesis of a relatively late land-based colonization of Sicily by Homo sapiens...|$|E
