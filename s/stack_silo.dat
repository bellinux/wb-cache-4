40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{investigate}} the temperature at different depths of the <b>stack</b> <b>silo</b> and strata front profile {{before and after the}} removal of silage. Also, the pH values in the upper and lower profile and the silage density of the fresh materials (FM) and dry matter (DM) in pearl millet silages with particle sizes of 5 or 20 mm, with or without inoculant, were assessed, using corn silage as controls. There was an interaction (P< 0. 05) silage × stratum profile and silage × depth profile for the temperatures before the removal of silage, and the pearl millet silages had lower temperatures in the upper stratum compared to corn. The temperature gradient between the silage and environment pearl millet and corn silos were smaller in the lower stratum profile. The temperature gradient after the removal of the silage was less than 50 cm deep at all the pearl millet silos. There were no differences in the densities of the FM and DM of the studied silages. The pH values of the silages before their removal were higher in the upper stratum and lower stratum in the bottom of all the pearl millet silages, in contrast with corn silage. The pearl millet silos had lower pH values in the lower stratum of the silo. Silages with 5 mm particle size provide lower temperatures in the middle portion of the panel before the removal of the silage. The use of bacterial inoculant in this study did not change the characteristics evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Results at Kansas State University {{from over}} 200 laboratory-scale trials and 28 farmscale trials showed that {{bacterial}} inoculants consistently improved preservation efficiency and nutritive {{value of the}} ensiled material. In contrast, anhydrous ammonia or urea adversely affected dry matter recovery and production per ton of crop ensiled. Economic analysis also favored the use of bacterial inoculants over nonprotein-nitrogen additives. Research conducted using corn, sorghum, and alfalfa silages showed that sealing the exposed surface dramatically reduced top spoilage losses in bunker, trench, or <b>stack</b> <b>silos...</b>|$|R
5000|$|In New Zealand and Northern Europe, the silo or [...] "pit" [...] {{is often}} a bunker built {{into the side of}} a bank, usually made out of {{concrete}} or old wooden railroad ties (railway sleepers). The chopped grass can then be dumped in at the top, to be drawn from the bottom in winter. This requires considerable effort to compress the <b>stack</b> in the <b>silo</b> to cure it properly. Again, the pit is covered with plastic sheet and weighed down with tire weights.|$|R

At left, a long wooden dock {{is in the}} foreground, while {{on the far side}} of the water, a big sign advertises "Globe A Flour" near a large <b>silo.</b> <b>Stacks</b> of lumber are visible near the water at left, and several buildings are visible on top of a ridge that runs parallel to the waterfront in the background. At center, several large steam ships are tied up along the waterfront, including a dark-hulled ship slightly to the left of center and a light-hulled ship at center. A tugboat is also at center. There is a large square building with a domed roof overlooking the water at center. At right, a massive dark-hulled ocean liner is spewing smoke from its smokestack. The wooden dock in the foreground continues at right, and several railroad cars are visible along the curved surface. At extreme right is the shore, and the dock intersects it in the distance. Several large warehouse buildings are visible, and many ships can be seen in the water in the background...|$|R
