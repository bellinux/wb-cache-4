5|$|Some science-fiction {{fans have}} speculated that the Quatermass serials in general, and Quatermass II in {{particular}} — with its elements including a conspiracy of <b>silence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> government concerning extraterrestrial life, secret government facilities for alien use, and the silencing of any critic who opposes the government's plans — influenced the successful American series The X-Files (1993–2002). Kneale was invited to write for The X-Files during the 1990s, but declined the offer.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} scenes is {{heightened}} by alternating between objective and subjective perspectives, the warm {{face of the}} Earth and the depths of dark space, the chaos and unpredictability of the debris field, and <b>silence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vacuum of space with the background score giving the desired effect. The film uses very long, uninterrupted shots throughout to draw the audience into the action, but contrasts these with claustrophobic shots within space suits and capsules.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor uses Amy's {{communication}} chip {{to track}} her location, and lands the TARDIS in the Silence's control room five days later. As River and Rory hold the Silence at bay, the Doctor shows them the live {{broadcast of the}} moon landing. As they watch, the Doctor uses his modification of the Apollo command module to insert Canton's recording of the wounded Silent into the footage of the landing. Because of this message, humans will now turn upon the Silence whenever they see them. The group frees Amy and departs in the TARDIS, while River kills all the <b>Silence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control room. Amy reassures Rory that the man he overheard her speaking of loving through the communication chip was him, not the Doctor.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, Nesbitt {{appeared}} in Wall of Silence, a fact-based drama about {{the aftermath of}} the murder of schoolboy Jamie Robe. Nesbitt played Stuart Robe, the boy's father, who tries to break down the wall of <b>silence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> local community to discover exactly what happened to his son. He had only just completed Bloody Sunday when he was offered the part and was unsure whether he wanted to take on such a demanding role so soon after playing Ivan Cooper. He decided to accept the part because he found it interesting. To prepare for the role, Nesbitt met with Robe and spent weeks talking to him in his South London flat, learning about Jamie, and of Robe's fight for his justice. Nesbitt spoke with his natural accent instead of affecting Robe's South London speech, as he did not want the audience to be distracted from the drama. The single-drama was filmed over four weeks and broadcast in January 2004. The role gained Nesbitt an IFTA nomination for Best Actor in a TV Drama later that year.|$|E
5|$|In Salinas, Genevevo Salinas of Houston had voluntarily gone to {{a police}} station when {{officers}} asked him to accompany them {{to talk about the}} murder of two men. Salinas answered most of the officers' questions, but simply remained silent when they asked him whether shotgun casings found {{at the scene of the}} murders would match his gun. He shifted his feet, and otherwise acted nervously, but did not say anything. Later, at his trial, prosecutors told jurors that his <b>silence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face of that question showed that he was guilty, that he knew that the shotgun used to kill the victims was his. Salinas' lawyer wanted the Supreme Court to rule that the simple fact of silence during police questioning, when an individual was not under arrest, could not be used against that person at a criminal trial.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} shot in Spain from September 1964 until April 1965, with a break in filming from late December until late February. Welles's {{limitations}} on the film included a budget of $800,000 and actors Jeanne Moreau and John Gielgud being available for five and ten days respectively, while Margaret Rutherford was only available for four weeks. Welles later joked that during one scene which included seven principal characters, none of the actors were available and stand-ins were used for over-the-shoulder shots of all seven characters. Filming began in Colmenar and included all of John Gielgud's scenes. Welles then traveled to Cardona, where the Royal Court scenes and Marina Vlady's scenes were shot, and to Madrid's Casa de Campo Park, where the Gadshill robbery scene was filmed. Madrid was also {{the location of the}} Boar's Head Tavern set, where Welles shot Moreau's and Rutherford's scenes. The production then traveled to Pedraza for some outdoor street scenes, and then to Soria to shoot in the snow for the opening shots. After shooting some scenes with Justice Shallow and Justice <b>Silence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Basque country, Welles returned to Madrid in December to film the battle scenes in Casa de Campo Park for ten days.|$|E

40|$|The {{endosperm}} is an ephemeral tissue {{surrounding the}} embryo {{that is essential}} for its development. Aside from the embryo nourishing function, the endosperm serves as a battlefield for epigenetic processes that have been hypothesized to reinforce transposable element <b>silencing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> embryo. Specifically, global DNA demethylation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> central cell may serve to produce small RNAs that migrate to egg cell and embryo to induce de novo DNA methylation. The Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC 2) is particularly targeted to DNA hypomethylated regions, possibly alleviating the negative effects associated with loss of DNA methylation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> endosperm. The functional requirement of <b>the</b> PRC 2 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> endosperm can be bypassed by increasing the maternal genome dosage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> endosperm, suggesting a main functional role of the endosperm PRC 2 in reducing sexual conflict. We therefore propose that the functional requirement of an endosperm PRC 2 was coupled {{to the evolution of}} a sexual endosperm and mechanisms enforcing transposon <b>silencing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> embryo. The evolutionary consequences of this scenario for genome expansion will be discussed...|$|R
5|$|The post of a Whip {{normally}} required <b>silence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{chamber of}} the House of Commons, but in February 1976 Dormand {{was involved in a}} difficult situation which required him to give an explanation. The Conservative opposition had called a vote censuring the Secretary of State for Industry Eric Varley by reducing his salary to £1,000. Dormand was appointed as one of the tellers to count the vote, but both he and his Conservative opposite number miscounted and lost the true count. When Mellish announced the confusion to the Speaker, the Speaker agreed to hold another vote. Embarrassingly for Dormand, many Labour MPs had not stayed to hear the result and were no longer present, resulting in the Conservatives winning the vote by a majority of five. The Government decided that the result was not a true indication of the House's opinion and overturned the vote a few days later.|$|E

25|$|The {{silence of}} the sources can be {{examined}} by reference to two main periods: (i) 1531–1556 and (ii) 1556–1606 which, for convenience, may loosely be termed (i) Zumárraga's silence, and (ii) the Franciscan silence. Despite the accumulation of evidence {{by the start of}} the 17th century (including allusions to the apparitions and the miraculous origin of the image), the phenomenon of <b>silence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sources persists well into the second decade of that century, by which time the silence ceases to be prima facie evidence that there was no tradition of the Guadalupe event before the publication of the first narrative account of it in 1648. For example, Bernardo de Balbuena wrote a poem while in Mexico City in 1602 entitled La Grandeza Mexicana in which he mentions all the cults and sanctuaries of any importance in Mexico City except Guadalupe, and Antonio de Remesal published in 1620 a general history of the New World which devoted space to Zumárraga but was silent about Guadalupe.|$|E
40|$|The {{silencing}} of transgene expression at {{the level}} of transcription <b>in</b> <b>the</b> soma of Caenorhabditis elegans through an RNAi-dependent pathway has not been previously characterized. Most gene silencing due to RNAi in C. elegans occurs at the post-transcriptional level. We observed transcriptional silencing when worms containing the elt- 2 ::gfp/LacZ transgene were fed RNA produced from the commonly used L 4440 vector. The transgene and the vector share plasmid backbone sequences. This transgene silencing depends on multiple RNAi pathway genes, including dcr- 1, rde- 1, rde- 4, and rrf- 1. Unlike post-transcriptional gene <b>silencing</b> <b>in</b> worms, elt- 2 ::gfp/LacZ silencing is dependent on the PAZ-PIWI protein Alg- 1 and on the HP 1 homolog Hpl- 2. The latter is a chromatin silencing factor, and expression of the transgene is inhibited {{at the level}} of intron-containing precursor mRNA. This inhibition is accompanied by a decrease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> acetylation of histones associated with the transgene. This transcriptional <b>silencing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> soma can be distinguished from transgene <b>silencing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> germline by its inability to be transmitted across generations and its dependence on the rde- 1 gene. We therefore define this type of silencing as RNAi-induced Transcriptional Gene Silencing (RNAi-TGS). Additional chromatin-modifying components affecting RNAi-TGS were identified in a candidate RNAi screen...|$|R

25|$|The wounded Emery {{suggests}} that Annie {{be killed in}} order to allow everyone to escape, alarming the rest of the group. While in the kitchen, Cathy Kramer is attacked by Mrs. Waterman and is rescued by Nick. The two decide to tie up the deranged woman and leave her in the kitchen. They agree not to inform Emery so that the unstable young man does not become more unbalanced. A ghostly Sukeena appears and drags Mrs. Waterman off into the dark wine cellar. As Nick and Cathy head back toward the main hall, the house changes around them and they become lost. A mysterious shape under the carpet chases them, and they flee. The shape begins to catch up to them, and Nick shoves Cathy into a room and slams the door behind her, turning around {{just in time to see}} a skeletal monster rushing up to him. With <b>silence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hallway, Cathy opens the door again but finds no sign of Nick or the entity in the empty hallway. As the house continues to change around her, Cathy ends up in the attic. Suddenly overcome by the urge to automatically write, she witnesses the murder of John Rimbauer by Ellen and Sukeena. Steve and Rachel, meanwhile, decide to look for Nick and Cathy. They find Cathy in the attic, where she is about to be attacked by a corpse-like creature. Their presence seemingly prevents the house from acting, and the corpse drops lifeless to the floor.

40|$|We have {{identified}} a putative RNA helicase from Dictyostelium that {{is closely related to}} drh- 1, the ‘dicer-related-helicase’ from Caenorhabditis elegans and that also has significant similarity to proteins from vertebrates and plants. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) -tagged HelF protein was localized <b>in</b> speckles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nucleus. Disruption of the helF gene resulted in a mutant morphology in late development. When transformed with RNAi constructs, HelF− cells displayed enhanced RNA interference on four tested genes.

Furthermore, <b>the</b> efficiency of <b>silencing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wild-type was dramatically improved when helF was disrupted in a secondary transformation. Silencing efficiency depended on transcription levels of hairpin RNA and the threshold was dramatically reduced in HelF− cells. However, the amount of siRNA did not depend on hairpin transcription. HelF is thus a natural nuclear suppressor of RNA interference. In contrast, no improvement of gene silencing was observed when mutant cells were challenged with corresponding antisense constructs. This indicates that RNAi and antisense have distinct requirements even though they may share parts of their pathways...|$|R
