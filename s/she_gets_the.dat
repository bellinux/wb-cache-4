500|$|The {{video was}} shot on May 30, 2008 in Los Angeles, California. Unexpectedly, several girls began crying during the shoot; Cyrus {{attributed}} {{this to the}} emotions in the song. Ratner was impressed with Cyrus' instinct and ability to address emotional issues while making them [...] "fun at the same time". Ratner compared her to Madonna, saying, [...] "she can be hanging out and laughing, and then you put the camera on her and it's like, 'Holy shit!'" [...] The effervescence made editing {{more difficult for the}} director. He said, [...] "It was the hardest video I've ever edited because every moment was great. Every moment that she was on camera, she was amazing. She's got an incredible quality about her. <b>She</b> <b>gets</b> <b>the</b> camera, and that's {{what it takes to make}} a great music video."

500|$|Also in 1988, Gaven {{played the}} part of the Russian chess player's wife Svetlana in the {{short-lived}} Broadway production of the musical Chess, for which she was praised by critics. The following year she appeared as Carol Bates in the Broadway musical Welcome to the Club. It revolves around four men who have been put in jail for not paying alimony. The musical shows why they ended up divorcing their wives, one of which is played by Gaven. Both Chess and Welcome to the Club were unsuccessful. John Simon criticized the latter musical in a New York Magazine review but praised Gaven's performance, writing: [...] "The cast ranges from the charmless to the hopeless [...] in this mess. Only Marcia Mitzman manages to stand out from the crowd, and when <b>she</b> <b>gets</b> <b>the</b> right part in the right show, she'll do just fine." [...] Associated Press drama critic Michael Kuchwara also wrote negatively about Welcome to the Club while giving praise to Gaven for projecting [...] "a sympathy [...] that isn't apparent in the book." ...|$|E

Two weeks later, Hurley visits Libby's grave and expresses how much he misses her before leaving a flower.|$|E
500|$|Jay Cocks of TIME {{magazine}} {{offered a}} mixed review, stating [...] "or all its sass, {{there is something}} a little too careful about this album: the rhythms are too studied and studiobound, the sexiness slightly forced. It's as if Jackson, aware that this was her premier effort under a new, $40 million record deal, felt weighed down by the burden of proving herself. When, however, she kicks loose on What'll I Do, a nifty, '60s-style soul stirrer, it's clear that Jackson's got nothing to prove to anyone, including herself." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times compares Jackson to her brother Michael and Madonna, stating [...] "Jackson's real strength, abetted by Jam and Lewis, is the way she tops dance-club rhythms with pop melodies. Less up-to-the-second than Madonna but still effective, the Jackson team has obviously {{been listening to the}} competition. Madonna's 'Justify My Love' echoes in 'That's the Way Love Goes,' and 'If' resembles Michael Jackson's 'Why You Wanna Trip on Me,' starting with screaming guitar and a chanted verse, rising to a sweet melody." [...] He also comments that despite its shortcomings, [...] "he album's not about being real; it's about seamlessness and ingenuity, about giving the public something it can use. For a superstar, Jackson is downright selfless, but <b>she</b> <b>gets</b> <b>the</b> job done." ...|$|E

2500|$|Conversely, {{it may be}} {{advantageous}} to the bondholder for the borrower to prepay if the low-coupon MBS pool was bought at a discount (<100). This {{is due to the}} fact that when the borrower pays back the mortgage, he does so at [...] "par". So if the investor bought a bond at 95 cents on the dollar, as the borrower prepays he or <b>she</b> <b>gets</b> <b>the</b> full dollar back and his or her yield increases. However, this is unlikely to happen, as borrowers with low-coupon mortgages have very little incentive to refinance.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Ballinger {{began to}} make a living by {{performing}} her live one-woman comedy act in character as Miranda. She arranged her own appearances and publicity {{for the first nine months}} but soon decided that she needed a professional manager. She moved to New York City in 2010 to follow performing opportunities, but returned to the West coast in 2012 when she realized that, to maximize her YouTube audience, she needed to collaborate with the community of YouTubers based in Los Angeles. Nevertheless, she says that <b>she</b> <b>gets</b> <b>the</b> most satisfaction from her live performances.

The campus newspaper, The Daily Texan, ran a profile of her in the issue dated July 27, 1962, headlined [...] "She Dares to Be Different." [...] The article began, [...] "She goes barefooted when she feels like it, wears Levis to class because they're more comfortable, and carries her Autoharp with her everywhere she goes so that in case <b>she</b> <b>gets</b> <b>the</b> urge to break into song, it will be handy.

2500|$|Silverstone {{continued}} her theatre work, next appearing in David Mamet's Boston Marriage (2007), a play exploring {{the relationship between}} two upper-class women, where the actress played what was described by Los Angeles Times as the [...] "clueless and hyper-emotional Scottish maid" [...] of one of them. The production {{was presented at the}} Geffen Playhouse theater in Los Angeles, with Variety writing that Silverstone [...] "steals the show [...] Her Scottish accent is good, her comic delivery is fresh, and <b>she</b> <b>gets</b> <b>the</b> maximum laugh value from each wobbly curtsey. Her character is the one thing in the show that Mamet gets absolutely right, although she is used a bit repetitively." [...] In the same year, she starred as a secretary in the theater production Speed-the-Plow, a satire on Hollywood executives and their monetary decisions. The production, presented at Geffen Playhouse, was directed by Randall Arney and penned by David Mamet. The Hollywood Reporter concluded the play was [...] "fueled" [...] by [...] "a spectacular tour de force" [...] from Silverstone.|$|E
2500|$|The Times commented, [...] "there is another, sweeter side to her travails. [...] Miranda loves singing and, despite – {{or perhaps}} because of – the satire, becomes an {{evocation}} of something all humans love to do and have done since before we discovered language. The very act of singing, however dire the sound, makes us feel good." [...] Ballinger noted that the TV show Glee (to which Miranda submitted an [...] "audition" [...] in 2010) is causing a resurgence of interest in singing in schools: [...] "Everyone is talking about Glee and choirs and musical theatre, igniting a flame that has been dimmed for a long time. ... Live performance and musical theatre were almost a lost art ... people need to be reminded that it takes a lot more effort to sing than just watching movies or TV shows." [...] Miranda followed up on this idea, saying: [...] "Since I became so famous ... everyone is watching more music and singing more – because everyone wants to be more like me." [...] As the Miranda character matured, its popularity grew especially with younger audiences of the Glee generation, with most of those attending her concerts being teenagers or in their twenties. Ballinger says that <b>she</b> <b>gets</b> <b>the</b> most satisfaction from her live performances.|$|E
