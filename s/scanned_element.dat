40|$|Many {{millimeter}} and far-infrared imaging {{systems are}} limited in sensitivity and speed because they depend on a single <b>scanned</b> <b>element.</b> Because of recent advances in planar detectors such as Schottky diodes, superconducting tunnel junctions, and microbolometers, an attractive approach to this problem is a planar antenna array with integrated detectors. A planar line antenna array and optical system for imaging has been developed. The significant advances are a 'reverse-microscope' optical configuration and a modified bow-tie antenna design. In the 'reverse-microscope' configuration, a lens {{is attached to the}} bottom of the substrate containing the antennas. Imaging is done through the substrate. This configuration eliminates the troublesome effects of substrate surface waves. The substrate lens has only a single refracting surface, making possible a virtually aplanatic system, with little spherical aberration or coma. The array is characterized by an optical transfer function that is easily measured. An array with 19 dB crosstalk levels between adjacent antennas has been tested and it was found that the array captured 50 percent of the available power. This imaging system was diffraction limited...|$|E

50|$|Any {{impairment}} {{of the electric}} contact between sensor <b>scanning</b> <b>element</b> and workpiece is, {{in the case of}} electric-contact sensors, problematic, e.g. welding spatters at the shielding gas nozzle, scale and rolling skin on the workpiece surface or through a wire electrode end which has molten spheroidally and has adherence of slag.When mechanical-contact sensors are used, the <b>scanning</b> <b>elements</b> must be adapted to the respective groove shapes. Butt welds with a square butt joint preparation must have a groove gap of more than 3 mm; in overlap joints the top plate must have a thickness of more than 3 mm.The sensor must be mounted separately from the welding torch.Thus, the groove scanning is mainly carried out in a leading position in front of the torch. If the welds are mainly straight, this adjustment is no problem. It is also possible to use <b>scanning</b> <b>element</b> arrays (e.g. fork callipers or separated <b>scanning</b> <b>elements</b> for height and lateral scanning which allow scanning in the torch level and thus weld scanning which is almost free from errors. Apart from the torch guidance along a weld groove, mechanical contact sensors can also be applied for detection of the weld start and end of the weld.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{required}} {{distance of the}} acting/break points in one level, transformers which are equipped with micro-switches have a control hysteresis in the working point which has the consequence of a restricted reproducible accuracy. Electric displacement of the working point is not possible. The other, above-mentioned transformer systems (the use of optical systems is probably limited due to design reasons) produce analogous signals {{in proportion to the}} <b>scanning</b> <b>element</b> deflection and allow thus the error-proportional weld head tracking and also the electric working point displacement through the superordinate control, e.g. in multiple layer welding. The output signals of the most commonly used inductive measuring transformer systems are between 0 and 10 V DC, depending on the <b>scanning</b> <b>element</b> deflection (Figure 2).|$|R

40|$|To {{reduce the}} high test time for serial scan designs, {{the use of}} {{multiple}} scan chains has been proposed. In this paper we consider the problem of optimally constructing multiple scan chains so as to minimize overall test time. Rather than follow the traditional practice of using equal length chains, we allow the chains to be of different lengths, and show that this can lead to lower test times. The main idea in our approach is to assign those <b>scan</b> <b>elements</b> that are more frequently accessed to shorter scan chains. Given a design with N <b>scan</b> <b>elements,</b> and given that k scan chains are to be used for applying tests, we present an algorithm of complexity 0 (kN 2) for configuring the chains such that the overall test application time is minimized. By analyzing a range of circuit topologies, we demonstrate test time reductions as large as 40 % over equal length chain configurations...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a procedure for inserting test {{points at the}} outputs of <b>scan</b> <b>elements</b> of a full-scan circuit {{in such a manner}} that the peak power during scan testing is kept below a specified limit while maintaining the original fault coverage. If the power in a clock cycle during scan testing excee& a specified limit (which depen& on the peak power the chip has been designed to supply), a "peak power violation" is said to occur. Given a set of vectors, simulation is used to identify the cycles in which peak power violations occur (called "violating cycles"). For each violating cycle, the reduction in power caused by a control-O and control- 1 test point at each <b>scan</b> <b>element</b> is determined by simulation. The optimization problem then is to select as few test points as possible to eliminate all violating cycles. We present a heuristic procedure for minimizing the number of test points using integer linear programming techniques. The test points are activated and deactivated in a manner such that there is neither any loss in fault coverage nor peak power violations in the capture cycle. Experimental results indicate that the proposed procedure is very effective in controlling peak power during scan testing using a small number of test points...|$|R
