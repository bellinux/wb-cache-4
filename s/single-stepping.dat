40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundSingle-step genomic best linear {{unbiased}} prediction (BLUP) evaluation combines relationship {{information from}} pedigree and genomic marker data. The {{inclusion of the}} genomic information into mixed model equations requires the inverse of the combined relationship matrix HH, which has a dense matrix block for genotyped animals. MethodsTo avoid inversion of dense matrices, <b>single-step</b> genomic BLUP can be transformed to <b>single-step</b> single nucleotide polymorphism BLUP (SNP-BLUP) which have observed and imputed marker coefficients. Simple block LDL type decompositions of the <b>single-step</b> relationship matrix HH were derived to obtain different types of linearly equivalent <b>single-step</b> genomic mixed model equations with different sets of reparametrized random effects. For non-genotyped animals, the imputed marker coefficient terms in the <b>single-step</b> SNP-BLUP were calculated on-the-fly during the iterative solution using sparse matrix decompositions without storing the imputed genotypes. Residual polygenic effects were added to genotyped animals and transmitted to non-genotyped animals using relationship coefficients {{that are similar to}} imputed genotypes. The relationships were further orthogonalized to improve convergence of iterative methods. ResultsAll presented <b>single-step</b> SNP-BLUP models can be solved efficiently using iterative methods that rely on iteration on data and sparse matrix approaches. The efficiency, accuracy and iteration convergence of the derived mixed model equations were tested with a small dataset that included 73, 579 animals of which 2885 were genotyped with 37, 526 SNPs. ConclusionsInversion of the large and dense genomic relationship matrix was avoided in <b>single-step</b> evaluation by using fully orthogonalized <b>single-step</b> SNP-BLUP formulations. The number of iterations until convergence was smaller in <b>single-step</b> SNP-BLUP formulations than in the original <b>single-step</b> GBLUP when heritability was low, but increased above that of the original <b>single-step</b> when heritability was high...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background A <b>single-step</b> {{blending}} approach allows genomic prediction {{using information}} of genotyped and non-genotyped animals simultaneously. However, the combined relationship matrix in a <b>single-step</b> method {{may need to}} be adjusted because marker-based and pedigree-based relationship matrices may not be on the same scale. The same may apply when a GBLUP model includes both genomic breeding values and residual polygenic effects. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare <b>single-step</b> blending methods and GBLUP methods with and without adjustment of the genomic relationship matrix for genomic prediction of 16 traits in the Nordic Holstein population. Methods The data consisted of de-regressed proofs (DRP) for 5 214 genotyped and 9 374 non-genotyped bulls. The bulls were divided into a training and a validation population by birth date, October 1, 2001. Five approaches for genomic prediction were used: 1) a simple GBLUP method, 2) a GBLUP method with a polygenic effect, 3) an adjusted GBLUP method with a polygenic effect, 4) a <b>single-step</b> blending method, and 5) an adjusted <b>single-step</b> blending method. In the adjusted GBLUP and <b>single-step</b> methods, the genomic relationship matrix was adjusted for the difference of scale between the genomic and the pedigree relationship matrices. A set of weights on the pedigree relationship matrix (ranging from 0. 05 to 0. 40) was used to build the combined relationship matrix in the <b>single-step</b> blending method and the GBLUP method with a polygenetic effect. Results Averaged over the 16 traits, reliabilities of genomic breeding values predicted using the GBLUP method with a polygenic effect (relative weight of 0. 20) were 0. 3 % higher than reliabilities from the simple GBLUP method (without a polygenic effect). The adjusted <b>single-step</b> blending and original <b>single-step</b> blending methods (relative weight of 0. 20) had average reliabilities that were 2. 1 % and 1. 8 % higher than the simple GBLUP method, respectively. In addition, the GBLUP method with a polygenic effect led to less bias of genomic predictions than the simple GBLUP method, and both <b>single-step</b> blending methods yielded less bias of predictions than all GBLUP methods. Conclusions The <b>single-step</b> blending method is an appealing approach for practical genomic prediction in dairy cattle. Genomic prediction from the <b>single-step</b> blending method can be improved by adjusting the scale of the genomic relationship matrix. </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCompared {{with the}} {{currently}} widely used multi-step genomic models for genomic evaluation, <b>single-step</b> genomic models can provide more accurate genomic evaluation by jointly analyzing phenotypes and genotypes of all animals and can properly correct {{for the effect}} of genomic preselection on genetic evaluations. The objectives {{of this study were}} to introduce a <b>single-step</b> genomic model, allowing a direct estimation of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects, and to develop efficient computing algorithms for solving equations of the <b>single-step</b> SNP model. We proposed an alternative to the current <b>single-step</b> genomic model based on the genomic relationship matrix by including an additional step for estimating the effects of SNP markers. Our <b>single-step</b> SNP model allowed flexible modeling of SNP effects {{in terms of the number}} and variance of SNP markers. Moreover, our <b>single-step</b> SNP model included a residual polygenic effect with trait-specific variance for reducing inflation in genomic prediction. A kernel calculation of the SNP model involved repeated multiplications of the inverse of the pedigree relationship matrix of genotyped animals with a vector, for which numerical methods such as preconditioned conjugate gradients can be used. For estimating SNP effects, a special updating algorithm was proposed to separate residual polygenic effects from the SNP effects. We extended our <b>single-step</b> SNP model to general multiple-trait cases. By taking advantage of a block-diagonal (co) variance matrix of SNP effects, we showed how to estimate multivariate SNP effects in an efficient way. A general prediction formula was derived for candidates without phenotypes, which can be used for frequent, interim genomic evaluations without running the whole genomic evaluation process. We discussed various issues related to implementation of the <b>single-step</b> SNP model in Holstein populations with an across-country genomic reference population...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe first {{national}} <b>single-step,</b> full-information (phenotype, pedigree, and marker genotype) genetic evaluation {{was developed for}} final score of US Holsteins. Data included final scores recorded from 1955 to 2009 for 6, 232, 548 Holsteins cows. BovineSNP 50 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) genotypes from the Cooperative Dairy DNA Repository (Beltsville, MD) were available for 6, 508 bulls. Three analyses used a repeatability animal model as currently used for the national US evaluation. The first 2 analyses used final scores recorded up to 2004. The first analysis used only a pedigree-based relationship matrix. The second analysis used a relationship matrix based on both pedigree and genomic information (<b>single-step</b> approach). The third analysis used the complete data set and only the pedigree-based relationship matrix. The fourth analysis used predictions from the first analysis (final scores up to 2004 and only a pedigree-based relationship matrix) and prediction using a genomic based matrix to obtain genetic evaluation (multiple-step approach). Different allele frequencies were tested in construction of the genomic relationship matrix. Coefficients of determination between predictions of young bulls from parent average, <b>single-step,</b> and multiple-step approaches and their 2009 daughter deviations were 0. 24, 0. 37 to 0. 41, and 0. 40, respectively. The highest coefficient of determination for a <b>single-step</b> approach was observed when using a genomic relationship matrix with assumed allele frequencies of 0. 5. Coefficients for regression of 2009 daughter deviations on parent-average, <b>single-step,</b> and multiple-step predictions were 0. 76, 0. 68 to 0. 79, and 0. 86, respectively, which indicated some inflation of predictions. The <b>single-step</b> regression coefficient could be increased up to 0. 92 by scaling differences between the genomic and pedigree-based relationship matrices with little loss in accuracy of prediction. One complete evaluation took about 2 h of computing time and 2. 7 gigabytes of memory. Computing times for <b>single-step</b> analyses were slightly longer (2 %) than for pedigree-based analysis. A national <b>single-step</b> genetic evaluation with the pedigree relationship matrix augmented with genomic information provided genomic predictions with accuracy and bias comparable to multiple-step procedures and could account for any population or data structure.

40|$|<b>Single-step</b> {{implementations}} of multi-qubit gates {{are generally}} believed {{to provide a}} simpler design, a faster operation, and a lower decoherence. For coupled three qubits interacting with a photon field, a realizable scheme for a <b>single-step</b> Toffoli gate is investigated. We find that the three qubit system can be described by four effective modified Jaynes-Cummings models in the states of two control qubits. Within the rotating wave approximation, the modified Jaynes-Cummings models are shown to be reduced to the conventional Jaynes-Cummings models with renormalized couplings between qubits and photon fields. A <b>single-step</b> Toffoli gate is shown to be realizable with tuning the four characteristic oscillation periods that satisfy a commensurate condition.

40|$|High quality MSS {{membranes}} were synthesised by a <b>single-step</b> and two-step catalysed hydrolyses employing tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), {{absolute ethanol}} (EtOH), I M nitric acid (HNO 3) and distilled water (H 2 O). The Si- 29 NMR {{results showed that}} the two-step xerogels consistently had more contribution of silanol groups (Q(3) and Q(2)) than the <b>single-step</b> xerogel. According to the fractal theory, high contribution of Q(2) and Q(3) species are responsible for the formation of weakly branched systems leading to low pore volume of microporous dimension. The transport of diffusing gases in these membranes is shown to be activated as the permeance increased with temperature. Albeit the permeance of He for both <b>single-step</b> and two-step membranes are very similar, the two-step membranes permselectivity (ideal separation factor) for He/CO 2 (69 - 319) and He/CH 4 (585 - 958) are one to two orders of magnitude higher than the <b>single-step</b> membranes results of 2 - 7 and 69, respectively. The two-step membranes have high activation energy for He and H- 2 permeance, in excess of 16 kJ mol(- 1). The mobility energy for He permeance is three to six-fold higher for the two-step than the <b>single-step</b> membranes. As the mobility energy is higher for small pores than large pores and coupled with the permselectivity results, the two-step catalysed hydrolysis sol-gel process resulted in the formation of pore sizes in the region of 3 Angstrom while the <b>single-step</b> process tended to produce slightly larger pores.
