40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} {{reproducibility}} of a triaxial seismic accelerometer under controlled conditions and real-life conditions. Methods: Instrumental reproducibility was examined using a <b>shaker</b> <b>device.</b> The accelerometers (DynaPort MiniMod; McRoberts B. V., The Hague, The Netherlands) were shaken at four frequencies (0. 8, 2. 1, 3. 6, and 4. 6 Hz) in x- and y-directions. The magnitude of acceleration ranged from 0 to 1. 277 g. Additionally, reproducibility under real-life conditions was examined in 55 adolescents (12 - 17 yr), with the accelerometer {{attached to the}} lower back. Each subject walked four short walking trials on level ground at preferred speed. To make this setting meet real-life conditions, we detached and reattached the accelerometer between trials 2 and 3. Detachment of accelerometer between trials 2 and 3 was done by either the same researcher or different researchers (four in total). Intra- and interobserver reproducibility were calculated. Results: Intra- and interinstrumental intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were 0. 99 for both x- and y-directions. The intrainstrumental coefficients of variance (CoV) were lower than 1. 13 %. The interinstrumental CoV were lower than 1. 37 %. Intraobserver ICC was 0. 97, and interobserver ICC was 0. 88. Conclusion: The reproducibility of the accelerometer is high under the controlled conditions of a <b>shaker</b> <b>device</b> and in walking at preferred speed. © 2009 The American College of Sports Medicine...|$|E

40|$|The {{structure}} of a cubesat satellite, manufactured in laminated composite material is provided of an accelerometer and a piezoelectric sensor to monitor his structural behaviour and transmit it via wireless radio connection. The aim of this experiment is to sense permanently the state of stress and/or deformation to which a generic space structure is subjected during transportation, assembling, launch or operative life. This capability is achieved by mean {{of a network of}} sensors, wired to a processing unit. Such unit is linked to a remote control station via wireless radio connection to transmit the acquired data, collect and process it.

30|$|The most {{effective}} factors for adsorption process, including contact time (10 – 105  min), pH (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10), adsorbent dose (0.4 – 1.5  g/L) and initial concentration of aniline and phenol (50 – 150  mg/L) were assessed on aniline and phenol removal. The optimum pH {{was determined by}} varying the pH {{in the range of}} 2 – 10 and keeping other variables constant (contact time, adsorbent dose and initial aniline and phenol concentration). The experiments were performed in a 100 -mL beaker with a constant concentration of aniline and phenol. Then, this mixture was shaken with a <b>shaker</b> <b>device</b> of enforcing model with 150  rpm at temperatures between 20 and 25  °C. 0.1  N HCl and NaOH were used to adjust the of the pH solution.

40|$|Vehicle {{vibrations}} {{have raised}} articulate awareness in agricultural industry {{during the last}} years. Especially, the legal basis with the EU directive 2002 / 44 /EC and its implementation into national law with the corresponding ordinance have sensitized the manufacturers concerning the vibration behaviour of their vehicles accompanied with an increasing demand for ride comfort by the customers. Furthermore, vehicle components stress due to vibration and shock is also significantly dependent on the tires vibration characteristics. Only an optimized design and combination of the vehicle components can reduce vibrations and improve ride comfort and endurance strength. In this thesis mechanical vibrations in the ride comfort frequency range between 10 Hz and 80 Hz are regarded. For the investigations a new mechanical <b>shaker</b> <b>device</b> has been developed and single frequency force excitations in the mentioned frequency range {{can be applied to}} a rolling tire. From excitation and response of the system it is possible to identify the vibration modes of the rolling tire. The shaker is designed to be applied both to a flat-belt test stand and a research tractor. Additionally, uniformity and cleat tests have been conducted with the research tractor in order to compare shaker, tire and impact excitations...|$|E

40|$|In this talk, we {{demonstrate}} {{the realization of}} smart sensors and actuators through the exploitation of principles of nonlinear dynamics at the micro scale. Specifically, we demonstrate combining sensing and actuation into a single device through what is called smart switches triggered by the detection of a desirable physical quantity. The concept aims to reduce the complexity of systems that rely on controllers and complex algorithms to realize on-demand trigger actions. In {{the first part of}} the talk, we discuss the category of switches triggered by the detection of gas. Toward this, electrostatically microbeams resonators are fabricated, then coated with highly absorbent polymers (MOFs), and afterward are exposed to gases. Such devices can be useful for instant alarming of toxic gases. In the second part, we demonstrate switches triggered by shock and acceleration. The concept is demonstrated on a millimeter-scale capacitive sensor. The sensor is tested using acceleration generated from <b>shakers.</b> Such <b>devices</b> can be used for the deployment of airbags in automobiles...|$|R
40|$|Target {{areas for}} Ucides cordatus (Linnaeus, 1763) {{restocking}} programs are often located {{far from the}} laboratory where larval rearing is developed. During translocation, the larvae are submitted to highly stressful conditions due to handling, packing, and transport activities. The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess the mortality rates of U. cordatus megalopae caused by different transportation procedures. Megalopae at loading densities of 50, 150, and 300 ind. L- 1 were packed in double polyethylene 12 x 25 cm plastic bags with 200 ml of marine water at salinity 30. The bags were filled with oxygen at a proportion of 1 : 2 parts of water and sealed tightly. The trepidations during transport were simulated by the use of a <b>shaker</b> <b>device</b> (800 vibrations/minute) over periods of three and six hours inside a dark container. The survivorship rates of larvae after simulation were compared to those obtained in control groups, which consisted of plastic vials with megalopae at a loading density of 50 ind. L- 1 maintained at rest. Immediately after the two transport simulations, there was no significant difference in survivorship between the treatments and the control. However, 24 hours after simulation some of the tested densities resulted in significantly lower survivorships. The results demonstrated that U. cordatus megalopae can tolerate six hours of shaking during transportation, at high densities with minimal mortality...|$|E
40|$|LectureLecture 1 : Pre-Salt {{development}} projects {{continue to expand}} offshore Brazil into ever deeper waters year after year. Consequently, the required Discharge Pressures for Re-Injection Compressors aboard FPSO?s are likely to exceed current 550 bar levels, and requirements for design of higher pressure compressors becomes more severe. This paper presents development of super high pressure compressor {{and the results of}} verification tests. Super high pressure compressor can be used as re-injection compressor or injection compressor such as in the CCS plant and FPSO. Rotor stability is the most considerable requirement for super high pressure operation because of the high density flow destabilizing force in the compressor. From {{the point of view of}} rotor dynamics, the short bearing span and high shaft diameter are desirable for the stability of the rotor. On the other hand, from the point of view of aerodynamics performance, that rotor arrangement may decrease the performance. Some parametric study was conducted to optimize the boss ratio of compressor stage to get both high rotor dynamic stability and high aerodynamic performance. Rotating stall can be the cause of sub-synchronous vibrations in super high pressure operating condition and it induces narrow operation range. To prevent such situation, vaned diffuser was applied for developed compressor stage and it can also help to reduce the diffuser radius space. Seal leakage flow have large effects on the rotor stability and aerodynamic performance. For this item, the hybrid construction of hole pattern seal and step labyrinth seal was proposed. Hole pattern seal is well known as damping seal for high pressure compressor. CFD dynamic analysis and dynamic characteristics test for this hybrid hole pattern seal are introduced under the condition of high density by using hydraulic <b>shaker</b> <b>device.</b> The extensive verification test of developed super high pressure compressor were conducted with impeller of optimized boss ratio, vaned diffuser and hybrid honeycomb seal, and has demonstrated the robustness for all field operating condition including molecular weight variation with high aerodynamic performance and small vibration...|$|E
40|$|Experimental modal {{analysis}} (EMA) of bridges and other civil structures {{can be used}} to acquire quantitative data describing their condition, and enhance opportunities for structural health monitoring and related fields. The use of EMA on civil structures has been limited by the high cost of the excitation devices that are required for the best data quality. The objective of the research reported herein is to evaluate a low-cost excitation system for multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) EMA, enabling the production of accurate estimates of the global behavior of in-service bridges. The prototype excitation system is composed of consumer entertainment devices, namely tactile transducers and subwoofer amplifiers, which are capable of providing excitation in the range of 5 Hz to 200 Hz. The use of these devices in vibration testing is unprecedented, and their low cost allows approximately 30 structural degrees-of-freedom to be excited {{for the price of a}} single purpose-built laboratory <b>shaker</b> <b>device.</b> Methods are developed to systematically characterize the operational performance of the devices. Research and testing are also performed to optimize the techniques by which the system can be used for MIMO EMA of bridges. The excitation system is then validated for MIMO EMA by dynamically characterizing a large-scale laboratory structure and comparing the results to those from traditional excitation methods. The system is then deployed on an in-service highway bridge, representing the first time that more than two shakers have been used in MIMO EMA testing of a bridge. The identification results using MIMO EMA are shown to be superior to those found using traditional excitation methods. Finally, the identified modal parameters of the in-service bridge are used in load rating. Direct use of the modal properties of a bridge for load rating is unprecedented, and a relatively simple method to use measured modal flexibility to help determine live load demand is developed herein. The bridge load ratings calculated from the new method are compared to traditional methods. In summary, a low-cost excitation system is optimized and systematically evaluated for MIMO EMA testing of civil structures, and the use of the system is validated in the laboratory and in the field. A new method to improve bridge rating reliability is then developed using the high quality modal parameters found via the optimized testing process...|$|E
