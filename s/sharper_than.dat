5|$|Some jumping spiders' {{visual acuity}} exceeds {{by a factor}} of ten that of dragonflies, which have by far the best vision among insects; in fact the human eye is only about five times <b>sharper</b> <b>than</b> a jumping spider's. They achieve this by a telephoto-like series of lenses, a four-layer retina and the ability to swivel their eyes and {{integrate}} images from different stages in the scan. The downside is that the scanning and integrating processes are relatively slow.|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994 was fortuitously timed for astronomers, coming {{just a few}} months after Servicing Mission 1 had restored Hubble's optical performance. Hubble images of the planet were <b>sharper</b> <b>than</b> any taken since the passage of Voyager 2 in 1979, and were crucial in studying the dynamics of the {{collision of}} a comet with Jupiter, an event believed to occur once every few centuries.|$|E
5|$|Within {{weeks of}} {{the launch of the}} telescope, the {{returned}} images indicated a serious problem with the optical system. Although the first images appeared to be <b>sharper</b> <b>than</b> those of ground-based telescopes, Hubble failed to achieve a final sharp focus and the best image quality obtained was drastically lower than expected. Images of point sources spread out over a radius of more than one arcsecond, instead of having a point spread function (PSF) concentrated within a circle 0.1arcsec in diameter as had been specified in the design criteria.|$|E

5|$|When Tomoyo After was ported to the PlayStation 2 (PS2), {{improvements}} to the game were included. This edition's scenario was expanded by the original staff after {{the removal of the}} adult content consisting of sex scenes. Yūto Tonokawa wrote some of the additional story for Takafumi and Kanako. With the added scenario and visuals combined, the PS2 edition is 1.5 times longer than the Windows edition. In the original version, the entire cast excluding Tomoya Okazaki, had full voice acting; this was not changed for the PlayStation 2 version. Added support was included so as to make the visuals on the television <b>sharper</b> <b>than</b> in the past with visual novels played on a consumer console rather than on a computer screen. The PS2 version also reduced flickering of the picture, reducing eyestrain.|$|E
5|$|The pelagic {{stingray}} {{has a very}} thick, distinctively wedge-shaped pectoral fin disc one-third wider than long, with broadly curved leading margins, rather angular outer corners, and nearly straight trailing margins. The snout is short with a rounded tip. The eyes are minute and, unlike in other stingrays, do not protrude above the body; the spiracles (paired respiratory openings) follow immediate behind. There is a short but broad curtain of skin between the nostrils, with a weakly fringed rear margin. The mouth is small and gently arched, with deep furrows at the corners and a tiny projection {{at the center of}} the upper jaw that fits into an indentation on the lower jaw. There are anywhere from 0 to 15 forked papillae (nipple-like structures) in a row across the floor of the mouth. There are 2534 upper tooth rows and 2531 lower tooth rows; the teeth of both sexes have single, pointed cusps, but those of adult males are longer and <b>sharper</b> <b>than</b> those of adult females. The margins of the pelvic fins are nearly straight in front and become rounded at the tips and in back.|$|E

The Intertoto and UEFA Cup expedition took a lot out of the players – but the team started the season <b>sharper</b> <b>than</b> the others, resulting in a comfortable upper-midtable position by the halfway point of the season. Tiredness, loss of form and a build-up of injuries resulted in a slide downwards towards the end of the season, eventually resulting in a ninth-place finish and a third consecutive year in the top half.|$|E
25|$|Obsidian {{can be used}} to make {{extremely}} sharp knives, and obsidian blades are a type {{of glass}} knife made using naturally occurring obsidian instead of manufactured glass. Obsidian is used by some surgeons for scalpel blades, although this is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use on humans. Well-crafted obsidian blades, as with any glass knife, can have a cutting edge many times <b>sharper</b> <b>than</b> high-quality steel surgical scalpels, the cutting edge of the blade being only about 3 nanometers thick. Even the sharpest metal knife has a jagged, irregular blade when viewed under a strong enough microscope; when examined even under an electron microscope an obsidian blade is still smooth and even. One study found that obsidian incisions produced fewer inflammatory cells and less granulation tissue at seven days, in a group of rats, although no differences were found after 21 days. Don Crabtree produced obsidian blades for surgery and other purposes, and has written articles on the subject. Obsidian scalpels may currently be purchased for surgical use on research animals.|$|E
500|$|The extrema {{are not of}} {{any great}} {{interest}} in themselves, but {{are used in the}} calculation of several more useful parameters. [...] Some of these parameters require the measurement of the exact position of the extremum. [...] Either maxima or minima can equally be used, from a mathematical point of view, but minima are preferred because they are always much <b>sharper</b> <b>than</b> maxima, especially for large reflections, as shown in figure 4.

500|$|Brett Davinger of The California Literary Review called Brian's antics [...] "creepy", {{particularly}} his {{smile at the}} end of the episode. Despite this, Davinger complimented the episode for focusing on one single plot. Nick Campbell of TV.com wrote that [...] "Junior Salesman"—along with [...] "Vandalism"—was [...] "so much <b>sharper</b> <b>than</b> last week's trial in Dullsville". Campbell also complimented the return of Michael Schur as Mose and the performances of Matt L. Jones and Brian Baumgartner.

500|$|A {{line in the}} epistle, [...] "For {{the word}} of God is quick and powerful, and <b>sharper</b> <b>than</b> any two-edged sword" [...] (...) , {{possibly}} prompted {{the choice of the}} hymn. The unknown poet of the cantata text kept stanzas 1, 3, 6 and 7 unchanged, expanding 3 by recitative, and reworded 2, 4 and 5 for the respective movements of the cantata. The topic of the gospel is God's word, as Jesus explains in verse 11, [...] "Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.", which is mentioned in the first line of the hymn, [...] "bei deinem Wort" [...] (close to your word). Instead of relating closely to the parable, the poet concentrates on a general request to God: to keep his people faithful to his word, to protect them from enemies and to provide peace.|$|E

500|$|Steak {{has become}} a popular dish in many places around the world, cooked in {{domestic}} as well as professional kitchens, and is often a primary ingredient in a menu. It is used in small amounts in an hors d'oeuvre, in an entrée dish or more usually, in a larger amount as the main course. A steak knife is a specialized piece of cutlery to make cutting the steak easier. It is <b>sharper</b> <b>than</b> other knives and has a serrated edge. Steak has also been an important breakfast dish, especially for people undertaking hard outdoor work, such as farmers. [...] Diners ordering steak at a restaurant typically advise the chef or waiter of their preferences regarding the degree of cooking, using the terms [...] "rare", [...] "medium-rare", [...] "medium", [...] "medium-well", or [...] "well-done". [...] Print appearances of this use of [...] "rare" [...] are found as early as c. 1615.|$|E

Gabe Graziani of GameSpy thought the graphics were beautiful and also commended {{the design of the}} tracks. Eduardo Zacarias of GameZone stated that Wipeout Pulse was a [...] "very visually pleasing game with some solid visual effects", and also praised the detailed tracks and ships. A reviewer from Game Revolution considered the game's level of detail to the tracks and smooth framerate to be [...] "staggering" [...] on a handheld. The reviewer also praised the [...] "meticulously constructed" [...] backdrops and [...] "incredibly styled" [...] presentation. Guy Cocker of GameSpot said that the visuals were [...] "superb", though he thought that many aspects were similar to its predecessor, Wipeout Pure. A reviewer from Edge described the visuals as [...] "even smoother, brighter, and <b>sharper</b> <b>than</b> Pure's".|$|E
500|$|Like {{almost all}} members of the Felidae, cats have protractable and {{retractable}} claws. In their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with the skin and fur around the paw's toe pads. This keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows the silent stalking of prey. The claws on the fore feet are typically <b>sharper</b> <b>than</b> those on the hind feet. Cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more paws. They may extend their claws in hunting or self-defense, climbing, kneading, or for extra traction on soft surfaces. Most cats have five claws on their front paws, and four on their rear paws. The fifth front claw (the dewclaw) is proximal to the other claws. More proximally is a protrusion which appears to be a sixth [...] "finger". This special feature of the front paws, {{on the inside of the}} wrists, is the carpal pad, also found on the paws of big cats and dogs. It has no function in normal walking, but is thought to be an antiskidding device used while jumping. Some breeds of cats are prone to polydactyly (extra toes and claws). These are particularly common along the northeast coast of North America.|$|E

500|$|Brett Davinger of The California Literary Review called Brian's antics [...] "creepy", and {{wondered}} if the character would begin to emulate {{the characteristics of the}} eighth season character Cathy, who attempted to cheat with Jim. He called the Jim and Darryl story filler, but was more positive about Oscar and Kevin's story, noting that the ending was [...] "a short segment, but well done". Bonnie Stiernberg of Paste magazine wrote that the idea of Brian temporarily dividing Pam and Jim led to [...] "one of the more out-of-the-box episodes" [...] of the series. However, she felt that the writers should have [...] "thought of [...] sometime last season" [...] and that the concept seemed forced. Stiernberg paralleled the quick buildup to Pam and Brian's relationship unfavorably to the slow buildup of Pam and Jim's initial attraction to each other. Nick Campbell of TV.com wrote that [...] "Vandalism"—along with [...] "Junior Salesman"—was [...] "so much <b>sharper</b> <b>than</b> last week's trial in Dullsville". He felt that the episode was [...] "important", because it continued the plot involving Brian. Campbell initially was not pleased with the development, but said that the plot will be [...] "the ultimate test of the show's romantic theory" [...] that [...] "the meek men (the proletariat) constantly and righteously upending the established and neglectful men (the bourgeoisie) in the lives of The Offices womenfolk".|$|E
500|$|... "Do or Die" [...] is 1 {{minute and}} 59 seconds long {{and is in}} the key of A major. The {{instruments}} used on the track are tuned slightly <b>sharper</b> <b>than</b> standard. The song begins with an intro featuring a lead guitar and keyboard melody, which plays twice, accompanied by a rhythm guitar riff alternating between A and D chords, drums and bass. The track breaks down to just rhythm guitar, drums and bass for the first verse which begins after 13 seconds. The first chorus begins after 23 seconds with a distorted guitar playing the chord sequence D5, C5, B5 and A5 twice while Rhys sings [...] "If we do or die we should try, if we don't try I say bye-bye, and if I say bye-bye, I'll wonder why we didn't try to do or die" [...] backed by high harmony backing vocals and occasional keyboard noises. The song breaks down again for a second verse before the second chorus enters at 46 seconds. An instrumental passage follows with the lead guitar and keyboard reprising the melody which plays during the intro. The instrumental leads into a double chorus. At the end of the final chorus the track crescendos, with Rhys singing [...] "yeah, yeah, yeah" [...] and all instruments {{with the exception of the}} keyboard coming to an abrupt silence after 1 minute and 43 seconds. Keyboard noises continue and gradually fade out until the track ends.|$|E
500|$|Matriarch of the Blues {{received}} mixed critical reception. Allmusic's Matthew Robinson {{wrote that}} James [...] "coast" [...] through the album and the backing band lacked [...] "youthful vitality". Robinson thought the album's opening track [...] "Gotta Serve Somebody" [...] came across {{more as a}} [...] "sleepy suggestion". However, he felt the [...] "draggier pace and intermittent woofs" [...] in [...] "Miss You" [...] added sex appeal and complimented the [...] "funkification" [...] of [...] "Born on the Bayou" [...] and [...] "Hound Dog". Associated Press contributor Gene Bright wrote a positive review of the album but was disappointed with James' cover of [...] "Miss You", writing [...] "the song just can't be slowed and manipulated with any success". People magazine contributors felt that the motorcycle sound in the introduction was unnecessary and considered the album to be more [...] "full-throated gospel-rock" [...] than blues. However, they wrote that James sounded [...] "as sexy and full of sass as she did {{nearly half a century}} ago". With James' sons contributing to the album, Bill Milkowski of JazzTimes called the album a [...] "real family affair" [...] and [...] "worthy follow-up" [...] to Heart of a Woman. In his review for Out, Barry Walters complimented Donto and Sametto's rhythm performances. Walters noted that James lacked all of the vocal notes available to her in the 1960s but wrote that her [...] "interpretive abilities are <b>sharper</b> <b>than</b> ever".|$|E
