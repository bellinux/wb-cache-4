5|$|Pericles' {{manner of}} thought and rhetorical {{charisma}} {{may have been in}} part products of Anaxagoras' emphasis on emotional calm in the face of trouble and <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> divine phenomena. His proverbial calmness and self-control are also often regarded as products of Anaxagoras' influence.|$|E
5|$|Cheney's {{views on}} NATO {{reflected}} his <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> prospects for peaceful social {{development in the}} former Eastern Bloc countries, where he saw a high potential for political uncertainty and instability. He felt that the Bush Administration was too optimistic in supporting General Secretary of the CPSU Mikhail Gorbachev and his successor, Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Cheney worked to maintain strong ties between the United States and its European allies.|$|E
5|$|From {{an early}} age, Shoup was molded by the {{progressive}} ideas of Indiana politicians, sympathizing with rural progressives {{fighting against the}} interests of big businesses. He developed an anti-imperialist attitude, and his <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> American foreign policy, influenced by his small-town background, made him an outspoken opponent of the unnecessary use of military force. He felt the use of troops for economic or imperialist consideration was wrong, a viewpoint he would carry for his entire career.|$|E

5|$|Interest in {{the risk}} parity {{approach}} has increased since the late 2000s financial crisis as the risk parity approach fared better than traditionally constructed portfolios, {{as well as many}} hedge funds. Some portfolio managers have expressed <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> the practical application of the concept and its effectiveness in all types of market conditions but others point to its performance during the financial crisis of 2007-2008 as an indication of its potential success.|$|E
5|$|The Sea Dart {{began as}} Convair's entry in a 1948 U.S. Navy contest for a {{supersonic}} interceptor aircraft. During the time, {{there was much}} <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> operating supersonic aircraft from carrier decks. So {{in order to address}} this issue, U.S. Navy ordered many subsonic fighters. The worry had some foundation, since many supersonic designs of the time required long takeoff rolls, had high approach speeds, and were not very stable or easy to control—all factors that were troublesome on a carrier.|$|E
5|$|Beverly Chappell founded The Dougy Center in 1982 {{in tribute}} to Dougy Turno, who died of a brain tumor at age thirteen. In August 1981, Dougy {{wrote a letter to}} {{psychiatrist}} and author Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, a pioneer in near-death studies, on the subject of his own death. This prompted Kübler-Ross to connect Chappell with Dougy and his family, and Chappell to create support groups for grieving children. Despite Kübler-Ross' early influence on the organization, The Dougy Center does not subscribe to the Kübler-Ross model (a series of five emotional stages experienced by survivors of an intimate's death: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance) and has even expressed <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> the model.|$|E

In December 2015, the 35th issue sold an estimated 6,500 copies. According to Dave Carter, a writer for Comics Beat, this is a typical sales pattern for a modern comic. The series concluded with issue 47 in February 2017, which had estimated sales of about 6,300.

5|$|The global {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 led to public <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> {{the free market}} consensus even from some on the economic right. In March 2008, Martin Wolf, chief economics commentator at the Financial Times, announced {{the death of the}} dream of global free-market capitalism. In the same month macroeconomist James K. Galbraith used the 25th Annual Milton Friedman Distinguished Lecture to launch a sweeping attack against the consensus for monetarist economics and argued that Keynesian economics were far more relevant for tackling the emerging crises.|$|E
5|$|After the {{publication}} of Carr's essay, a developing view unfolded in the media as sociological and neurological studies surfaced that were relevant to determining the cognitive impact of regular Internet usage. Challenges to Carr's argument were made frequently. As the two most outspoken detractors of electronic media, Carr and Birkerts were both appealed to by Kevin Kelly to each formulate a more precise definition of the faults they perceived regarding electronic media so that their beliefs could be scientifically verified. While Carr firmly believed that his <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> the Internet's benefits to cognition was warranted, he cautioned in both his essay and his book The Big Switch that long-term psychological and neurological studies were required to definitively ascertain how cognition develops {{under the influence of}} the Internet.|$|E

While InfoVis has become a buzz topic in the digital humanities, <b>skepticism</b> remains <b>about</b> how effectively it integrates into and expands on traditional humanities research approaches. From an InfoVis per-spective, we lack case studies that show the specific design challenges that make literary studies and humanities research at large a unique application area for information visualization.

5|$|In {{addition}} to her law firm work, Sotomayor found visible public service roles. She was not connected to the party bosses that typically picked people for such jobs in New York, and indeed she was registered as an independent. Instead, District Attorney Morgenthau, an influential figure, served as her patron. In 1987, Governor of New York Mario Cuomo appointed Sotomayor {{to the board of}} the State of New York Mortgage Agency, which she served on until 1992. As part of one of the largest urban rebuilding efforts in American history, the agency helped low-income people get home mortgages and to provide insurance coverage for housing and AIDS hospices. Despite being the youngest member of a board composed of strong personalities, she involved herself in the details of the operation and was effective. She was vocal in supporting the right to affordable housing, directing more funds to lower-income home owners, and in her <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> the effects of gentrification, although in the end she voted in favor of most of the projects.|$|E

40|$|This {{retrospective}} {{case study}} of merger efficiencies focuses on the 1996 merger of two large, U. S. rail networks. Information on the public record permits some evaluation of pre-merger efficiency claims, and the weighing of those claims against regulatory and antitrust standards. Access to additional public and non-public information also permits at least a preliminary determination {{that a number of}} the claimed efficiencies were plausibly merger-specific and actually realized post-merger. This is contrary to <b>skepticism</b> expressed <b>about</b> merger efficiency claims, both generally and with respect to this particular rail merger, and thereby illustrates the value of doing retrospective studies of merger outcomes. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{review is}} an attempt to provide an {{integrative}} view for the biological changes triggered by fetal stress through a multidisciplinary approach. Acceleration of brain and lung maturation in certain risk pregnancies was first described clinically and confirmed by biochemical, electrophysiological and experimental data. Moreover, new experimental findings suggest that a fetal clock centrally mediated by fetal nutritional status could determine timing of parturition. However, some <b>skepticism</b> persisted <b>about</b> the usefulness of this body of knowledge for obstetrical management in developed countries. The interest concerning this adaptation to intrauterine stress was later renewed from various sources, as developed in Part II...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} the author {{considers}} three examples of modern constitutional doctrine that show how judges have stolen {{bits and pieces}} from popularized <b>skepticisms</b> <b>about</b> the job of judging and have molded this stolen rhetoric into doctrine. In the first example, she asks whether constitutional law 2 ̆ 7 s recent penchant for doctrinal rules based on 2 ̆ 2 clear law 2 ̆ 2 could have existed without the modern age 2 ̆ 7 s obsession with legal uncertainty. In the second, the author considers whether our contemporary rhetoric of constitutional 2 ̆ 2 interests 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 expectations 2 ̆ 2 reflects modern critiques of doctrine as failing to address social needs. In the third, she asks how an offhand reference to the term 2 ̆ 2 fundamental 2 ̆ 2 could come to describe a legal category defined by courts 2 ̆ 7 own fears of illegitimacy except in an age self-conscious of the judiciary 2 ̆ 7 s institutional weaknesses. If the author is right about these examples, {{it may be that}} what was once said of modern painting 2 ̆ 7 s abstraction [...] that whatever else it was about, it was 2 ̆ 2 about painting 2 ̆ 2 [...] is true of modern doctrine 2 ̆ 7 s abstraction as well: that it is about doctrine and doctrine 2 ̆ 7 s struggle in an age self-conscious of the possibility of doctrinal failure...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} twenty-five years, environmentalists have sought {{recognition}} {{for the right}} to a safe environment (RSE) in national and international fora. As a result, some countries have recognized RSE in their constitutions. Nevertheless, much <b>skepticism</b> exists <b>about</b> whether RSE is a genuine human right, and advocates of RSE still need to persuade critics that this right merits national and international recognition. This paper presents a normative defense of RSE. It argues that a right to a safe environment - defined narrowly - is a genuine human right because it passes appropriate justificatory tests. Part I defends the modest use of the language of rights in expressing environmental norms. Part II offers a narrow account of the scope of RSE. Part III provides a justification for RSE as conceived in part II...|$|R
