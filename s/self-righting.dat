5|$|A {{court of}} enquiry was held the {{following}} month in Liverpool by the Board of Trade, and focused particularly on {{the roles of the}} captains in the tragedy as well as the design of the Liverpool lifeboat. The court found that no-one was to blame for the loss of either Ellen Southard or the Liverpool lifeboat. Captain James Martin and his crew were praised for their gallantry in getting everyone off the ship, and absolved of any blame with respect to the capsizing of the lifeboat. The lifeboat was furthermore found to be of sound design and suitably adapted to her role, but debate continued for many years about the merits of the tubular design vs the <b>self-righting</b> one, as well as the requirement for lifeboats to be powered.|$|E
5|$|All-weather {{lifeboats}} (ALBs) {{are large}} boats with enclosed wheelhouses and survivor spaces below deck, which are <b>self-righting</b> and {{can go out}} in all weather conditions. Some ALBs carry an inflatable Y-class lifeboat or Y-boat for inshore work, launched by mechanical arm. There are six classes of ALB motor life boats, with speeds ranging from 17 to 25 knots. The RNLI's aim {{is to provide a}} 25-knot lifeboat to every all-weather crew, and has begun construction of an All-weather Lifeboat Centre (ALC) in Poole which, when complete, will save £3million a year. The RNLI took over the ALC in 2015 with the expectation of becoming fully operational in 2019, when six Shannon-class lifeboats a year will be built.|$|E
25|$|Motor life {{boats are}} {{designed}} to be <b>self-righting</b> if capsized but most other motorboats are not.|$|E
50|$|Chaos 2 {{immediately}} flipped X-Terminator 2, but XT2 <b>self-righted.</b> X-Terminator 2 then axed Chaos 2 {{and pushed}} them around, but Chaos 2 flipped X-Terminator 2 again {{and now they}} are unable to <b>self-right.</b> Refbot counts X-Terminator out. Winner: Chaos 2.|$|R
50|$|X-Terminator 2 {{was turned}} over, and they couldn't <b>self-right.</b> Refbot {{moved in and}} allowed XT2 to <b>self-right.</b> X-Terminator 2 then {{attacked}} the Refbot for some reason, before attacking Immortalis with its axe. Immortalis was then immobilized and Shunt pushed them into the pit. X-Terminator goes through to the heat semi final.|$|R
50|$|Robots {{are listed}} alphabetically. The weapon {{indicated}} is the weapon used to <b>self-right.</b>|$|R
25|$|Style (original series only): The {{extent to}} which the robot {{demonstrated}} its abilities such as <b>self-righting.</b> For the revived series, the style category was omitted.|$|E
25|$|The Vermilion surfmen’s {{rigorous}} {{training and}} drills with self-bailing and <b>self-righting</b> lifeboats in rolling seas made them so skillful that the United States Life Saving Service chose them {{to demonstrate their}} life saving at the St. Louis World Fair in 1904.|$|E
25|$|The hull {{was divided}} into five {{watertight}} compartments and spaces were filled with buoyant materials which combined with a watertight GRP wheelhouse {{to give it a}} <b>self-righting</b> capability. A survivors' cabin was sited forward of the wheelhouse with eight seats and a stretcher could be carried in the wheelhouse which had seats for the four crew members.|$|E
500|$|Razer's first {{battle was}} against Voltarc. It flipped Razer, but Lewis <b>self-righted</b> and Scott pierced Voltarc's armour. Razer {{was given the}} victory on a crowd's vote. Its next fight was against Agrippa, which Razer {{defeated}} by crushing through its opponent's electrical system. Razer's next adversary, Tazbot, beat it after flipping it onto the arena saws which severed a cable and left Razer unable to <b>self-right.</b>|$|R
50|$|Biohazard was {{the first}} robot to <b>self-right</b> in combat, against Vlad the Impaler in the 1996 tournament, however since the match had ended it made no {{difference}} to who actually won. Terminal Frenzy had attempted to right itself when it earlier came up against Biohazard, but failed to do so. The next year Vlad the Impaler fought Biohazard again, and the former used its special pneumatic lifting arm to <b>self-right</b> numerous times, yet it still lost the judge's decision.|$|R
50|$|RNLB Benjamin Bond Cabbell II (ON 12) was a Cromer non <b>self-righter</b> type {{lifeboat}} {{stationed at}} Cromer Lifeboat Station in the English county of Norfolk from September 1884 until September 1902.|$|R
25|$|The {{lifeboat}} {{is completely}} water-tight {{allowing it to}} self-right with up to 60 people on board. The boat {{has the potential to}} carry a maximum of 120 passengers on board, but without <b>self-righting</b> capability. The Survivors Space has room for 10 sitting and 8 standing. The Survivors Space is accessed either through the Wheelhouse or the fore deck Emergency Escape Hatch.|$|E
25|$|The large {{watertight}} cabin gave it <b>self-righting</b> capability. Two survivor cabins {{are situated}} below decks where first aid and emergency equipment is stowed. The hull {{is divided into}} 26 watertight compartments as protection against sinking should it be holed. There is also a flying bridge above the main cabin with an auxiliary steering position {{which can be used}} when additional height or visibility is required during an operation. The boat won a Design Council award in 1982.|$|E
25|$|A sea kayak's {{primary safety}} device is its paddler. Although some kayakers {{consider}} a well-practised <b>self-righting</b> move {{such as an}} Eskimo roll to be essential in order to safe open-water kayaking, it is the technique of bracing that every well-trained, experienced kayaker practises {{in order to maintain}} an upright position in their kayak. Practice in bracing is often neglected by inexperienced kayakers once they have learned the Eskimo roll. However, the reality is that having to roll really means having to recover from a failed brace. Being in the capsized position in some environments due to missing a brace can put the paddler in danger of colliding with obstacles under the water. Staying upright in surf zones, rocky surf zones (informally known as rock gardens), and rivers is most important and is only accomplished through well-practised and successful bracing.|$|E
50|$|The {{proposal}} {{was to establish}} both a stone boat house and stone slipway, {{and to protect the}} structure to allow safe launching of the lifeboat from the prevailing westerly winds through creation of a protective seawall. After accepting an estimate of £140 for the works, local contractors were engaged. Instead of building a new lifeboat, the RNLI proposed to move and reallocate the existing lifeboat at Sea Palling in Norfolk, England. Built in 1858 as a 30ft x 7ft 6inch, 10-oared <b>self-righter,</b> after sailing to a boatyard in London she was altered and lengthened to a 36ft x 8ft, 12-oared <b>self-righter</b> at a cost of £198.|$|R
50|$|The first {{attempted}} <b>self-right</b> in the UK Robot Wars was by a robot called Chaos, {{during its}} Series 2 heat final. However, it {{was unable to}} do so. Later in the series, Cassius successfully righted itself with its pneumatic flipping arm, after Sir Killalot had flipped it over with his drill during the semi-final pinball trial. Cassius was flipped again in the Grand Final, but it <b>self-righted</b> and flipped Roadblock to win the eliminator. In Series 3, Chaos' successor Chaos 2 used its innovative rear-hinged flipper panel to catapult itself {{through the air and}} then land on its wheels, a technique that later became standard.|$|R
50|$|Panic Attack was {{reverted to}} its chunkier body and caution-striped colour scheme. Its <b>self-righter</b> was {{replaced}} with a hard rubber panel for protection against overhead weapons, and a large skirt was added at the back. It was seeded 8th again.|$|R
25|$|St Ives is an {{historic}} fishing port in west Cornwall {{and offers a}} sheltered harbour for ships in the open waters of the Western Approaches. On 24 December 1838 the schooner Rival was trying to enter the harbour in a gale but came to grief on one of its piers; despite lacking proper rescue boats and equipment five people were saved after much courage and effort by the people ashore. A meeting was held and {{it was decided that}} a proper lifeboat should be built for the town. Francis Adams, a local man, had recently won a prize from the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society for designing a double-ended, <b>self-righting</b> lifeboat and he was commissioned to now build one. The Hope entered service in 1840, assisting the Mary Ann of Poole during a storm on 7 April. Hope had fallen out of use by 1860 so the following year the RNLI opened a new lifeboat station at Porthgwidden beach. It proved to be a difficult site to launch from and so in 1867 it was closed. It has since been used as a store.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the advice}} of the US consul at Liverpool, the United States Congress {{recognised}} the acts of bravery by issuing 27 Gold Lifesaving Medals to the lifeboat men who attempted to save her crew, after a two-year delay during which US law first had to be changed to allow the newly instituted medals to be awarded to non-US citizens. [...] Debate about lifeboat designs continued for many years until a <b>self-righting</b> design was eventually adopted.|$|E
500|$|Razer's {{weapon is}} a {{piercing}} arm which exerts approximately three tonnes of pressure {{per square inch}} (465kg/cm2, [...] ) at its tip. The arm was designed to pierce opponents' armour plating and break their internal components, rendering them impaired or immobile. This weapon {{was inspired by the}} principle of the brake press—a piece of industrial machinery used to bend metal—and maximises damage through the use of hydraulics. The arm is also an integral element of Razer's winged <b>self-righting</b> mechanism, which rolls the robot back onto its wheels if inverted. In later series of Robot Wars, an interchangeable hook was attached to the arm to lift robots immune from being pierced. The popularity of crushing and piercing weaponry in robot combat events is attributed to Razer, which inspired many imitations.|$|E
50|$|They're both at {{each other}} from the beginning, but Firestorm gave X-Terminator 2 a big flip and XT2 couldn't <b>self-right,</b> since they {{suffered}} from weapon problems. Meanwhile, Firestorm 4 had a go at Shunt and flipped him as well. Winner: Firestorm 4.|$|R
5000|$|The {{majority}} of flippers can double as srimechs. However, most flippers are powered by [...] and therefore have limited uses. Some axes {{can also be}} used as srimechs; the first robot to successfully use an axe to <b>self-right</b> was Iron Awe in Robot Wars Series 4.|$|R
50|$|After {{the mine}} is ejected {{from either the}} 'Hades' cluster bomb or JP233 {{dispenser}} a drogue parachute is deployed to slow the mine. The drogue parachute is quickly followed by the main parachute. After impact and a brief delay the mine <b>self-rights</b> and after another delay it arms itself.|$|R
500|$|The wind, tide and sea made it {{impossible}} for the Liverpool lifeboat to link up with the waiting tug for another tow, so the men were forced to start rowing home. [...] About twenty minutes later, as the boat reached the safer waters of the channel, the master elected to raise the foresail to help steady the vessel. [...] People in the lifeboat were still congratulating themselves on their lucky escape, when Captain Martin noticed a huge wave [...] "like a high wall" [...] approaching. He instructed everyone to hold on, fearing that someone might be washed overboard. [...] However rather than breaking over the boat, the wave lifted it and flipped it over. The boat was not <b>self-righting,</b> so the remaining survivors were left clinging desperately to the upturned boat. Rattlers master witnessed the incident, signaled to the New Brighton lifeboat, Willie and Arthur, which promptly turned around to come to the rescue. The men who were on the capsized boat directed the New Brighton lifeboat to first assist three others who were in more danger clinging to bits of wood in the sea. After picking up the survivors and one casualty, the New Brighton lifeboat was taken in tow by Rattler, which brought her back to New Brighton. [...] Six of Ellen Southards crew, the captain and his wife, as well as the pilot and three lifeboat men from Mersey Docks drowned or died of exposure (12 fatalities in total).|$|E
2500|$|... 'ON' is the RNLI's {{sequential}} Official Number. All {{boats were}} of the <b>self-righting</b> type.|$|E
2500|$|If a capsized vessel {{has enough}} {{flotation}} to prevent sinking, it may recover {{on its own}} if the stability is such {{that it is not}} stable inverted. [...] Vessels of this design are called <b>self-righting.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... ==Submunitions== The MW-1 was {{designed}} so that different types of submunitions may be loaded into its 112 tubes. The MIFF, MUSA and MUSPA mines are parachute dropped, and upon reaching the ground <b>self-right</b> and arm. The mines are blast-resistant and are reported to self-destruct within less than forty days from deployment.|$|R
50|$|The 47' MLB is {{designed}} to weather hurricane force winds and heavy seas, capable of surviving winds up to 60 kn, breaking surf up to 6 m and impacts up to three G's. If the boat should capsize, it <b>self-rights</b> in less than ten seconds with all equipment fully functional.|$|R
50|$|Panic Attack turned X-Terminator 2 over, {{and due to}} a spike {{that was}} {{attached}} to the front, it couldn't <b>self-right.</b> Panic Attack pressed the pit button, and rolled X-Terminator back on its wheels. X-Terminator 2 then drove on top of Panic Attack's lifting forks, and Panic Attack slowly pushed X-Terminator into the pit. Winner: Panic Attack.|$|R
2500|$|A vessel may be {{designated}} as [...] "self-righting" [...] {{if it is}} designed to be able to capsize then return to upright without intervention (with or without crew on board). [...] Most small craft intended as lifeboats with rigid (rather than inflatable) hulls designed since about the middle of the twentieth century are <b>self-righting.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Cayley, from Brompton-by-Sawdon, near Scarborough in Yorkshire, {{inherited}} Brompton Hall and Wydale Hall {{and other}} estates {{on the death}} of his father, the 5th baronet. [...] Captured by the optimism of the times, he engaged {{in a wide variety of}} engineering projects. [...] Among the many things that he developed are <b>self-righting</b> lifeboats, tension-spoke wheels, ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his book}} Captain Joshua Slocum, Joshua's son Victor Slocum stated that [...] "the ballast was {{concrete}} cement, stanchioned down securely to ensure it against shifting should the vessel be hove on her beam-ends. There was no outside ballast whatever. The Spray {{could have been}} <b>self-righting</b> if hove on her beam-ends, a fact that was proven, since, by an experiment on an exact duplicate of the original boat and ballasted just like her. The test boat was hove down with mast flat to the water and when released righted herself." ...|$|E
50|$|The first {{organised}} {{rescue service}} at Wells {{was run by}} the Norfolk Shipwreck Association and began in 1830 when an existing lifeboat that had been at Cromer was sent to Wells. The boat had no name but was of the Greathead or North Country non <b>self-righter</b> type. It was a pulling lifeboat and was powered with ten oars.|$|R
5000|$|Panic Attack was seeded 8th {{for this}} series. Its design was vastly changed from {{previous}} years, with a flatter body, no <b>self-righter,</b> and four wheels instead of six. This version was colloquially {{referred to as}} [...] "Panic Attack Gold" [...] or [...] "Panic Attack 24k" [...] because it was painted gold and silver instead of its signature yellow and black. Davies was wholly unsatisfied with this version.|$|R
50|$|Before Typhoon 2 {{was able}} to get its weapon up to speed, Atomic spotted the danger and {{attempted}} to flip it but Typhoon 2 did not turn over. Atomic tried once more to flip Typhoon 2 but it hit the arena grinder instead and flipped itself onto its back, unable to <b>self-right.</b> Typhoon 2 charged up its weapon and attacked Atomic three times causing major damage before Atomic was eventually counted out. Typhoon advanced to Round 6.|$|R
