5|$|The most {{decorated}} room in {{the building}} is the Sala Nobile (Noble Hall) on the first floor, which was originally a courthall, and which is now used as a meeting room. Here the judge and the nominated College of Advocates <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench,</b> which itself was a platform, wearing typical silk gown clothing of the period. The advocates on the bench were nominated and removed {{at the discretion of}} the Grand Master. When Malta was a British colony a similar short lived system was adopted, on 14 August 1832, known as the King's Counsel. The bench consisted of the Advocates of the King, and survived seven years. This room has coats-of-arms of the Castellani depicted on the upper side of the walls. There are 105 coats-of-arms, belonging to the Castellani from 1609 to the last in 1798, after which the position was abolished.|$|E
2500|$|Joanna Rapf, {{writing about}} the filming of The Verdict, states that Lumet gave a lot of {{personal}} attention to his actors, whether listening to them or touching them. She describes how Lumet and star Paul Newman <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> secluded from the main set, where Newman had taken his shoes off, in order to privately discuss an important scene about to be shot[...] [...] [...] The actors walk through their scenes before the camera rolls. This preparation was done because Lumet likes to shoot a scene in one take, two at the most. Newman liked to call him [...] "Speedy Gonzales," [...] adding that Lumet did not shoot more than he had to. [...] "He doesn't give himself any protection. I know I would," [...] Newman said.|$|E
60|$|He <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> and {{the crook}} was made, a stem being given {{him into the}} bargain.|$|E
60|$|Fanny <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> and {{contemplated}} this mendacious stone.|$|R
60|$|They {{passed into}} the dairy, and <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> by the honey-suckled casement.|$|R
60|$|They <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> beneath <b>a</b> tall, ragged pine, and Osborne lighted a cigar.|$|R
60|$|So they <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> until {{a summons}} came to admit them to Mr. Marshall's private office.|$|E
60|$|Burke <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> {{outside the}} door, smoking silently in the dusk. Blanche was {{stirring}} about inside.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{does the}} man say?" [...] said the judge, {{turning his head}} down towards a {{satellite}} who <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> beneath his cushion.|$|E
60|$|Conolly {{followed}} him to a secluded part of the shrubbery, where they <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench.</b>|$|R
60|$|They {{knew what}} she meant, but nobody answered, and Grace <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> by the table.|$|R
60|$|She {{took the}} lute, and <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> beneath the house, {{while the rest}} grouped {{themselves}} round her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Link Merwell!" [...] {{broke in}} Shadow, who <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> near by. [...] "What about that rascal; {{have you heard}} {{something}} further of him?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then Barney {{lay down}} to sleep, and Tom <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> {{outside the door}} and began to make a whistle out of the pig's tail with his pocket-knife.|$|E
60|$|The instant {{that they}} were {{dismissed}} from parade, the boys hurried to their cousin. He was very pale from loss of blood, but was perfectly sensible. His brother <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> beside him, holding his head on his knee.|$|E
60|$|They {{went back}} to the hotel, and Dick <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> in the patio and lighted his pipe.|$|R
50|$|It {{was a nice}} autumn day. We went to the park. We <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> and talked. We had a nice time.|$|R
60|$|Susanna <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench,</b> {{and looked}} down at her feet. After a few moments, she {{tightened}} her lips; rose; and walked away.|$|R
60|$|Both {{boys were}} exhausted, but were too much {{disturbed}} {{to take a}} good sleep. Yet, as they <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench,</b> the eyes of each closed, and he took a series of naps, arousing at every unusual sound that penetrated to the underground cell.|$|E
60|$|I <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> in {{the waist}} of the ship, and {{at my feet}} lay {{the man who had}} been dragged from the sea with me. I thought that this man was dead till the first red rays of dawn lit upon his face, whereon he sat up, and I saw that he was Steinar.|$|E
60|$|And here I am, blazing {{out into}} print {{with the whole}} story just as he told it to me as we <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> by the lagoon before the Palace of Fine Arts with {{the cries of the}} sea gulls in our ears. Well, he should have kept his {{appointment}} with me. But I anticipate.|$|E
60|$|They <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench,</b> {{where the}} green cliff {{stretched}} out before them, over a sea quite clear of haze, far down and very blue.|$|R
6000|$|... "We are {{up against}} it and no mistake," [...] remarked Roger, dolefully, as {{he and the other}} players <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> in the {{boathouse}} to rest.|$|R
50|$|It {{was a nice}} autumn day. We (the two of us) went to the park. We (the two of us still) <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> and talked. We had a nice time.|$|R
60|$|And it {{was this}} day that Allie <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> in the little arbor and watched the {{turbulent}} river. She was sorry for her father, {{but she could not}} help him. Moreover, alien griefs did not greatly touch her. Her own grief was deep and all-enfolding. She was heart-sick, and always yearning--yearning for that she dared not name.|$|E
60|$|This {{struck me}} as being funny. After I had supped I <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> by {{the door of the}} inn and gossiped with two labourers about brickmaking, and motor cars, and the cricket of last year. And in the sky a faint new crescent, blue and vague as a distant Alp, sank westward over the sun.|$|E
6000|$|Some {{fifty yards}} further on he {{suddenly}} stopped and <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> at one side. The boy dropped the suit-case {{and stared at}} him with wondering, shrewd eyes. The young man took out his handkerchief and wiped his brow. It was a good handkerchief, a good brow, and the young man was good to look at. He said to the boy: ...|$|E
60|$|After a {{time they}} went to the Stanley park, where Jake and Mrs. Winter met {{somebody}} they knew. Carrie <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> under <b>a</b> giant fir and Jim lighted a cigarette.|$|R
60|$|That evening, {{as he and}} Gascoyne <b>sat</b> {{together}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> {{under the}} trees in the great quadrangle, Myles told of his adventure of the afternoon, and his friend listened with breathless interest.|$|R
60|$|Waving {{his hand}} to Peterson, {{who was in the}} distance, Dick {{followed}} the lame man and <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> in front of the shanty, the odd individual seating himself <b>on</b> <b>a</b> stool opposite.|$|R
60|$|Flora {{picked up}} the glasses and Wyndham, resting on his elbow, turned his head. The steamer drove on, a feather of foam {{shooting}} up her stem, and Wyndham languidly studied {{the faces of the}} passengers. Then, when she was level with the yacht, he moved abruptly, for a short, thin man with a yellow face <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench,</b> looking at Red Rose.|$|E
60|$|Kenwitz {{unscrewed}} {{a magnifying}} glass from his eye, routed out his parent from a dingy rear room, and abandoned the interior of watches for outdoors. He went with Dan, and they <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> in Washington Square. Dan had not changed much; he was stalwart, and had a dignity that was inclined to relax into a grin. Kenwitz was more serious, more intense, more learned, philosophical and socialistic.|$|E
6000|$|... "No--thanks--that is--I have {{no doubt}} you teach them all that's right, and we are {{exceedingly}} gratified with {{the way in which}} you conduct the school.--I say Val," [...] cried Scoutbush, who could support the part of patron no longer, [...] "what pretty little ducks they are, I wish I had a dozen of them! Come you here!" [...] and down he <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench,</b> and gathered a group round him.|$|E
60|$|We <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> in <b>a</b> retired par t of the Gardens, near {{a little}} fountain. A row of lighted lamps ran round the outer {{rim of the}} basin. I could see her plainly.|$|R
6000|$|We <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> {{that was}} near, and I said, [...] "After so many years, it is strange {{that we should}} thus meet again, Estella, here where our first meeting was! Do you often come back?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Wrenn {{insisted on}} paying for both their high teas at the cheap restaurant, timidly but earnestly. Morton was troubled. <b>As</b> they <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> park <b>bench,</b> smoking those most Anglican cigarettes, [...] "Dainty Bits," [...] Mr. Wrenn begged: ...|$|R
