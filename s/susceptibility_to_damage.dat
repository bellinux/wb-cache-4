BackgroundThe spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) develops {{much less}} renal damage than the stroke-prone strain of SHR (SHRsp) after salt-supplementation, {{and it has}} been proposed that these strains differ in their genetic <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> renal <b>damage.</b> However, radiotelemetric BP measurements have shown that salt-supplementation results in more severe and accelerated hypertension in the SHRsp. Therefore, it is unclear whether the differences in renal <b>damage</b> are due <b>to</b> differences in BP exposure or true differences in intrinsic (genetic) renal <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> hypertensive <b>damage.</b> MethodsKidney cross transplantation was performed between the SHR and SHRsp strains in uninephrectomized recipients to allow an investigation of the <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> renal <b>damage</b> in SHR and SHRsp kidneys maintained in the same host and exposed to the same BP profile and metabolic environment. Following transplantation, BP was radiotelemetrically monitored before and after an 8 % NaCl diet given to accelerate hypertension and renal damage. Then the kidneys were removed and renal damage was assessed histologically. ResultsIn the SHR recipients, the SHRsp donor kidneys exhibited more hypertensive damage than the contralateral native SHR kidneys, but histologic evidence of mild cellular immunologic rejection also was observed that could have facilitated the increased renal damage. However, even in SHRsp recipients, the native SHRsp kidneys exhibited twice the damage seen in the contralateral transplanted SHR kidneys. ConclusionThese data unequivocally demonstrate that the SHRsp kidneys are intrinsically more susceptible than the SHR kidneys <b>to</b> renal <b>damage</b> when exposed <b>to</b> exactly the same BP and metabolic environment...|$|R

Half of these fruit were picked and placed directly into trays, while the remainder were jostled using a standardized procedure to simulate handling during the harvesting process.

40|$|The gene at the Duchenne/Becker muscular {{dystrophy}} locus encodes dystrophin, {{a member of}} a protein superfamily that links the actin cytoskeleton to transmembrane plasmalemmal proteins. In mature skeletal myocytes, the absence of dystrophin is associated with decreased membrane stability, altered kinetics of several calcium channels, and increased intracellular calcium concentration. In the central nervous system, dystrophin is restricted to specific neuronal populations that show heightened <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> excitotoxic <b>damage</b> and is localized in proximal dendrites and the neuronal somata. We report that CA 1 pyramidal neurons in a hippocampal slice preparation from a dystrophin-deficient mouse genetic model of Duchenne {{muscular dystrophy}} (the mdx mouse) exhibit significant increased <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> hypoxia-induced <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> synaptic transmission. This selective vulnerability was substantially ameliorated by pretreatment with diphenylhydantoin, an anticonvulsant that blocks both sodium-dependent action potentials and low-threshold transient calcium conductances.

40|$|Interaction between Rf- 1 and Rf- 4 {{quantitative}} trait loci increases <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> renal <b>damage</b> in double congenic rats. BackgroundFive {{quantitative trait}} loci (QTLs), Rf- 1 to Rf- 5, {{were found in}} Fawn-Hooded hypertensive (FHH) rats influencing <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> renal <b>damage.</b> Previously, we found that single transfer of the Rf- 1 QTL from FHH rats onto the renal-resistant August × Copenhagen Irish (ACI) strain caused a small increase in renal <b>susceptibility.</b> <b>To</b> investigate the separate role of the Rf- 4 QTL and its interaction with Rf- 1, we generated a single congenic strain carrying Rf- 4 and a double congenic carrying both Rf- 1 and Rf- 4. MethodsDifferences in renal susceptibility between ACI, Rf- 1 A, and Rf- 4 single congenics and Rf- 1 A+ 4 double congenics were assessed using four different treatments: control (two-kidney), two-kidney with L-arginine analogue N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) -induced hypertension, unilateral nephrectomy, and unilateral nephrectomy + L-NAME. In separate experiments, renal blood flow (RBF) autoregulation was compared between two-kidney ACI and congenic rats. ResultsCompared to ACI, Rf- 1 A rats developed more renal damage, while Rf- 4 rats did not. The most severe renal damage {{was found in the}} Rf- 1 A+ 4 double congenic rats. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) demonstrated a significant interaction between the Rf- 1 A and Rf- 4 QTLs. The magnitude of the interaction varied with the type and duration of the treatment. The RBF autoregulation was impaired in Rf- 1 A single and Rf- 1 A+ 4 double congenics, while in Rf- 4 single congenics it was similar to that of ACI controls. ConclusionThese findings indicate that the Rf- 1 QTL directly influences renal susceptibility and autoregulation. In contrast, the Rf- 4 QTL shows no direct effects, but significantly increases <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> renal <b>damage</b> via an interaction with Rf- 1...|$|R
