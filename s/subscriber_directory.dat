5000|$|MSISDN (pronounced as /'em es ai es di en/ or misden) is {{a number}} uniquely {{identifying}} a subscription in a GSM or a UMTS mobile network. Simply put, it is the mapping of the telephone number to the SIM card in a mobile/cellular phone. This abbreviation has a several interpretations, the most common one being [...] "Mobile Station International <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Directory</b> Number".|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Today, it’s almost true to {{say that}} we live in a mobile world. There are over 5 billion mobile {{connections}} world-wide, almost 4 connections for every 5 people on globe. When people’s are roam across the world they most important things is to carry is Mobile phone but when they don’t have valid subscription with network operator for roaming, communication with external world is affected. There is two option either he can subscribe for expensive Roaming & other way to buy the local SIM of corresponding roaming location (which may lead to carry multiple SIM). With this White paper we try to solve the issue of National / International Roaming without carrying multiple SIM card. With this concept a single SIM card may contain multiple International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) belongs to unique mobile phone number known as Mobile Station International <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Directory</b> Number (MSISDN) where MNO (or MVNO) are manage the MSISDN mapping with currently used IMSI at server end...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Masters Diploma(Electrical Engineering)) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 1989 {{various types}} of {{electronic}} card test equipment are freely available today for different types of electronic printed circuit boards. A company certainly wants to pick the most suitable tester to suit their needs, and more importantly a tester that will fit into their bUdget. Today a company can easily import in-circuit testers that will cost well in the reglon of six figures. The cheaper the equipment go, the less features one can expect from the equipment. Like all other big decisions in life, this might also be a tough one for a company. Part one of this thesis will consider most of these questions, and will also give more insight on what type of specifications to look for. This section will also explain {{the different types of}} faults that occur, the repair costs involved, different types of card testers available and some of their features. Advanced in-circuit testing techniques will also be explained. Part two of this thesis describes the design and development of the Identif ier Card Tester. The" Program Control and Impulse Sender Card", (referred to as "Identifier Card") is one of the cards used in a system called "Electronic Identifier". The electronic identifier was developed to enable a <b>subscriber</b> <b>directory</b> number, a line or equipment numbers, or in general, the origin of information and classes-of-service to be determined by way of an existing connection within a telephone exchange. The system was designed for the purpose of incorporating it into the existing public exchanges where no identifier wires are available. It operates on the principle of a switching circuit (line) tester. The identification pulses are evaluated with the aid of 6 mm bistable magnetic ring cores according to the current steering principle. The program control and the output circuit uses a transistor, a magnetic core/transistor or a magnetic core/thyristor circuit. The electronic identifier is mostly used with "Routiners" in Electra-mechanical exchanges. The biggest percentage of failures on these systems are caused by the Identifier Card and hence the request {{for the development of a}} "Identifier Card Tester"...|$|E
50|$|The Rome {{facility}} featured {{an extensive}} range of programs, running from 8:00 a.m. to late at night. Programming consisted of news, including stock exchange {{reports and information}} about the Italian Parliament, religious services, time signals, and language courses. Also featured were musical concerts, both from a local studio and via contracted prominent theaters and other establishments. The number of subscribers was 100 in September 1910, growing to 1,100 two years later, and reaching a peak of 1,315 in December 1914. A <b>subscribers</b> <b>directory</b> from 1912 listed numerous prominent individuals, including Italy's Queen Elena, plus a listening station located at the Camera dei Deputati legislative building.|$|R
50|$|The {{choice of}} the main type of memory used in the TXE2 (and the TXE4) was {{particularly}} characteristic of the general design philosophy, that the components used had to be of a technology that had been tested over many years. The choice thus went to the 'Dimond ring' type of memory, named after T. L. Dimond of Bell Laboratories, who invented them in 1945. They were large-diameter magnetic ferrite toroidal rings with solenoid windings, through which are threaded writing and reading wires. This set-up is shown fairly clearly in the picture (above) of the Ambergate Calling Number Generator (CNG) and Class of Service (COS) racks. These racks gave the ability to convert a <b>subscriber's</b> <b>directory</b> number into an equipment location identity. This was a considerable innovation in British exchanges, since in Strowger exchanges the directory and equipment numbers {{had to be the}} same.|$|R
50|$|Available {{in print}} and online after the {{appropriate}} subscription has been taken out (it is free {{for members of the}} ICE), the magazine is aimed at professionals in the civil engineering industry. It contains industry news and analysis, letters from <b>subscribers,</b> a <b>directory</b> of companies, with listings arranged by companies’ areas of work, and an appointments section. It also occasionally has details of university courses and graduate positions.|$|R
50|$|In 1996, SOS Publications {{opened a}} website {{parallel}} to the magazine, digitising all of the print articles since January 1994 and providing additional, supplementary, content including audio and video files. The website grew to include a discussion forum, a <b>subscribers</b> area, a <b>directory</b> of professionals and companies in the music recording and technology sector and a shop through which browsers could purchase back issues of the magazine alongside merchandise, PDF articles and new subscriptions to the print edition.|$|R
40|$|Objective: This poster {{describes}} the methods by which InterNano, the information service and virtual {{home of the}} National Nanomanufacturing Network 1 (NNN), supports the information needs of the nanomanufacturing cohort: multi‐institutional and organizational stakeholders across diverse domains. Methods: InterNano 2 strives to support the nanomanufacturing research and development community through collection, organization, and dissemination {{of information on the}} nanomanufacturing domain. Services include a monthly newsletter and weekly mailer distributed to 4, 500 <b>subscribers,</b> a <b>directory</b> of 600 organizations and experts, a nanomanufacturing process database, expert reviews of topical peerreviewed articles, “highlight” articles that contextualize nanomanufacturing trends and news, an eprints research repository, and an events calendar, among other unique features and content. All content is tagged with terms from an original interactive nanomanufacturing taxonomy. Results: Since the internano. org launch in 2008, the NNN core team has seen an increase of user buy‐in and participation; users create and self‐manage directory entries, submit press releases for dissemination, and self‐subscribe to the newsletter. InterNano site traffic continues to increase as the NNN develops more content. Conclusions: The NNN team is currently refining and developing its services to better serve the diverse nanomanufacturing community, with plans underway to build a dashboard interface to better direct users to relevant information and to develop content across the board with a team of new contributing editors. 1 Funded by the National Science Foundation, CMMI‐ 1025020 2 [URL]...|$|R
