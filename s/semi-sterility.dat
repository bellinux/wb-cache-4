40|$|Abstract Background The sterile insect {{technique}} (SIT) {{has been}} used with success for suppressing or eliminating important insect pests of agricultural or veterinary importance. In order to develop SIT for mosquitoes, female elimination prior to release is essential as they are the disease-transmitting sex. A genetic sexing strain (GSS) of Anopheles arabiensis was created based on resistance to dieldrin, and methods of sex separation at the egg stage were developed. The use of this strain for SIT will require sexually sterile males: useful radiation doses for this purpose were determined for pupae and adults. Methods For {{the creation of the}} sexing strain, dieldrin-resistant males were irradiated with 40 [*]Gy using a 60 Co source and were subsequently crossed to homozygous susceptible virgin females. Individual families were screened for <b>semi-sterility</b> and for male resistance to dieldrin. For sex separation, eggs of a resulting GSS, ANO IPCL 1, were exposed to varying concentrations of dieldrin for different durations. Percent hatch, larval survival, and male and female emergence were recorded. Radiation induced sterility was determined following adult and pupa exposure to gamma rays at 0 – 105 [*]Gy. Mortality induced by dieldrin treatment, and levels of sterility post radiation were investigated. Results ANO IPCL 1 contains a complex chromosome aberration that pseudo-links the male-determining Y chromosome and dieldrin resistance, conferring high natural <b>semi-sterility.</b> Exposure of eggs to 2, 3, and 4 [*]ppm dieldrin solutions resulted in complete female elimination without a significant decrease of male emergence compared to the controls. A dose of 75 [*]Gy reduced the fertility to 3. 8 and 6. 9 % when males were irradiated as pupae or adults respectively, but the proportions of progeny of these males reaching adulthood were 0. 6 and 1. 5 % respectively Conclusion The GSS ANO IPCL 1 was shown to be a suitable strain for further testing for SIT though high <b>semi-sterility</b> is a disadvantage for mass rearing. </p...|$|E

3000|$|Several hybrid {{sterility}} genes/QTL {{have been reported}} in hybrids between O. sativa subsp. japonica and subsp. indica. For F 1 pollen sterility; for example, Sa in chromosome 1, Sb (S 24) in chromosome 5, Sc in chromosome 3, Sd (S 35) in chromosome 1, and Se (S 25) in chromosome 12 were identified through a series of allelic testcrosses (Guo et al. 2016). Pollen grains carrying japonica alleles of Sa, Sb, Sc, Sd or Se are known to cause selective pollen abortion in F 1 heterozygous plants, resulting in the predominant transmission of indica alleles to their progeny. Molecular cloning has been reported for the Sa and Sc genes (Long et al. 2008, Shen et al. 2017). The Sa locus comprises two adjacent genes, SaM and SaF, encoding a small ubiquitin-like modifier E 3 ligase-like protein and an F-box protein, respectively (Long et al. 2008).

40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} to screen different rice sub-species for wide compatibility (WC) and to evaluateF 2 populations of selected crosses to study the genetics of WC. Among the three criteria followed for screening of WCVsviz., pollen fertility per cent of hybrids, spikelet fertility per cent of hybrids and the spikelet fertility per cent of hybrids aswell as tester parents, the third criteria appeared to be effective. Based on spikelet fertility per cent of hybrids as well astester parents, seven out of 15 lines viz., Dular and ASD 16 (indicas); WCR 6, IR 65600 - 32 - 4 - 6 - 1, IR 65601 - 120 - 3 - 5, IR 66158 - 38 - 3 - 2 - 1 and IR 67323 - 46 - 2 - 1 (tropical japonica) were adjudged as WCVs. The F 2 segregation in seven crosses forspikelet fertility and <b>semi-sterility</b> were in agreement with trigenic complementary ratio (45 : 19).

40|$|The {{development}} of a universal soybean (Glycine max [L. ] Merr.) cytogenetic map that associates classical genetic linkage groups, molecular linkage groups, and a sequence-based physical map with the karyotype has been impeded due to the soybean chromosomes themselves, which are small and morphologically homogeneous. To overcome this obstacle, we screened soybean repetitive DNA to develop a cocktail of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) probes that could differentially label mitotic chromosomes in root tip preparations. We used genetically anchored BAC clones both to identify individual chromosomes in metaphase spreads and to complete a FISH-based karyotyping cocktail that permitted simultaneous identification of all 20 chromosome pairs. We applied these karyotyping tools to wild soybean, G. soja Sieb. and Zucc., which represents a large gene pool of potentially agronomically valuable traits. These studies led to the identification and characterization of a reciprocal chromosome translocation between chromosomes 11 and 13 in two accessions of wild soybean. The data confirm that this translocation is widespread in G. soja accessions and likely accounts for the <b>semi-sterility</b> found in some G. soja by G. max crosses...|$|E

40|$|Sterility {{is common}} in hybrids between {{divergent}} populations, such as the indica and japonica subspecies of Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa). Although multiple loci for plant hybrid sterility have been identified, it remains unknown how alleles of the loci interact at the molecular level. Here we show that a locus for indica-japonica hybrid male sterility, Sa, comprises two adjacent genes, SaM and SaF, encoding a small ubiquitin-like modifier E 3 ligase-like protein and an F-box protein, respectively. Most indica cultivars contain a haplotype SaM+SaF+, whereas all japonica cultivars have SaM−SaF− that diverged by nucleotide variations in wild rice. Male <b>semi-sterility</b> in this heterozygous complex locus is caused by abortion of pollen carrying SaM−. This allele-specific gamete elimination results from a selective interaction of SaF+ with SaM−, a truncated protein, but not with SaM+ {{because of the presence}} of an inhibitory domain, although SaM+ is required for this male sterility. Lack of any one of the three alleles in recombinant plants does not produce male sterility. We propose a two-gene/three-component interaction model for this hybrid male sterility system. The findings have implications for overcoming male sterility in inter-subspecific hybrid rice breeding...|$|E

I determined that Hopi Indian corn PI 213733 (variety Komona) displayed the trait and grew well in the U. S. Corn Belt. I crossed PI 213733 to 26 translocation tester stocks in Minnesota inbred A 188 background, backcrossed semi-sterile plants carrying the translocation to A 188 the next generation, and grew the segregating generation planted in trenches 15 cm deep with ridges of dirt 10 cm high one year, in trenches 25 cm deep the other year and also at normal (6 cm) depth. Emerged plants were classified for <b>semi-sterility</b> or for normal pollen. I concluded from multiple testers for each chromosome arm that dominant genes for long first internode are located (chromosome and region) on 3 S, on 6 near the centromere, and on 9 S; spurious associations occurred for two testers. Measurement of cell lengths indicated that PI 213733 had more cells than A 188 both in upper and in lower mesocotyl sections and that lower, older cells elongated sooner.

40|$|In plants, {{the male}} and female gametophytes {{represent}} the haploid generation that alternates with the diploid sporophytic generation. Male and female gametophytes develop from haploid micro- and megaspores, respectively. In flowering plants (angiosperms), the spores themselves arise from the sporophyte through meiotic divisions of sporogenous cells in the reproductive organs of the flower. Male and female gametophytes contain two pairs of gametes that participate in double fertilization, a distinctive feature of angiosperms. In this paper, we describe the employment of a transposon-based gene trap system to identify mutations affecting the gametophytic phase of the plant life cycle. Mutants affecting female gametogenesis were identified in a two-step screen for (i) reduced fertility (seed abortion or undeveloped ovules) and (ii) segregation ratio distortion. Non-functional female gametophytes do not initiate seed development, leading to <b>semi-sterility</b> such that causal or linked alleles are transmitted at reduced frequency to the progeny (non-Mendelian segregation). From a population of 2, 511 transposants, we identified 54 lines with reduced seed set (2 %). Examination of their distorted segregation ratios and seed phenotypes led to the isolation of 12 gametophytic mutants, six of which are described herein. Chromosomal sequences flanking the transposon insertions were identified and physically mapped onto the genome sequence of Arabidopsis thaliana. Surprisingly, the insertion sites were often associated with chromosomal rearrangements, making it difficult to assign the mutant phenotypes to a specific gene.

40|$|The {{southern}} cowpea weevil, Callosobruchus maculatus (F) is {{a severe}} agriculture pest worldwide. In the current work, newly emerged adult males of C.  maculatus have been irradiated {{with a low}} dose of 20 Gy gamma radiation. The inherited deleterious effects on the fecundity, hatchability, adult emergence, and the sterility percent were recorded for the progenies F 1 and F 2 of the irradiated parental males. The fecundity, hatched larvae, the number {{of males and females}} were reduced in both F 1 and F 2. The sterility percent was high in F 1 (70. 8 %) and increased in the F 2 (88. 3 %) generation. Histopathological effects were also documented in the testes of F 1 and F 2 progenies. The spermatids and sperms have exhibited a variety of abnormalities. In the early spermatids, the nebenkern outer cell membrane was ruptured. The spermatid nucleus loses its homogeneous texture and has multiple foci of dense chromatin, as well as, profiles range has little dense material. In some groups, the nucleus had a peculiar ring of chromatin. The sperms had shown a variety of aberrations. The sperms irregularity distributed in lysed cysts by unusual manner. Also, some sperms had remarkably enlarged axoneme and small rounded nucleus. Many of the sperm cells were observed with two axonemes, abnormal mitochondria derivatives, and more than two accessory bodies. These results indicate that the low dose of 20  Gy induces <b>semi-sterility</b> in C.  maculatus through generations.

40|$|Abstract Background The novel {{chimeric}} open {{reading frame}} (orf) resulting from the rearrangement of a mitochondrial genome is generally {{thought to be a}} causal factor in the occurrence of cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS). Both positive and negative correlations have been found between CMS-associated orfs and the occurrence of CMS when CMS-associated orfs were expressed and targeted at mitochondria. Some orfs cause male sterility or <b>semi-sterility,</b> while some do not. Little is currently known about how mitochondrial factor regulates the expression of the nuclear genes involved in male sterility. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the biological function of a candidate CMS-associated orf 220 gene, newly isolated from cytoplasmic male-sterile stem mustard, and show how mitochondrial retrograde regulated nuclear gene expression is related to male sterility. Results It was shown that the ORF 220 protein can be guided to the mitochondria using the mitochondrial-targeting sequence of the β subunit of F 1 -ATPase (atp 2 - 1). Transgenic stem mustard plants expressed the chimeric gene containing the orf 220 gene and a mitochondrial-targeting sequence of the β subunit of F 1 -ATPase (atp 2 - 1). Transgenic plants were male-sterile, most being unable to produce pollen while some could only produce non-vigorous pollen. The transgenic stem mustard plants also showed aberrant floral development identical to that observed in the CMS stem mustard phenotype. Results obtained from oligooarray analysis showed that some genes related to mitochondrial energy metabolism were down-regulated, indicating a weakening of mitochondrial function in transgenic stem mustard. Some genes related to pollen development were shown to be down-regulated in transgenic stem mustard and the expression of some transcription factor genes was also altered. Conclusion The work presented furthers our understanding of how the mitochondrially-targeted expression of CMS-associated orf 220 gene causes male sterility through retrograde regulation of nuclear gene expression in Brassica juncea. </p...|$|E

40|$|Diploid and {{triploid}} {{interspecific hybrid}} male progeny obtained from mating Misgurnus anguillicaudatus with M. mizoleis {{were reported to}} have histologically fertile and sterile testes, respectively. However, their reproductive capacity is still unclear because mating tests have not been examined using mature hybrids. Here, we examined physiological and genetic characteristics of spermatozoa of diploid and triploid hybrids. In diploid hybrid males, 1 n, 2 n and 4 n spermatozoa showing low motility were detected. However, spermatozoa of three diploid hybrid males could generate 2 n larvae. Therefore, only 1 n spermatozoa of diploid hybrid males was fertile to produce larva. The chromosomes of diploid hybrid males were transmitted to spermatozoa by random segregation between the homologous chromosomes because most larvae had one allele derived from both M. anguillicaudatus and M. mizolepis at all loci examined. In triploid hybrid males, spermatozoa could be categorized to three different types based on their ploidy status. Type 1 : In the first and second males, sperm samples mainly comprised 6 n spermatozoa. Motility and fertility were not recorded. Type 2 : The third male gave a large proportion of 6 n spermatozoa as well as a small proportion of 1 n spermatozoa. Although no motility was observed, larvae arose from eggs inseminated with such spermatozoa. Type 3 : In the fourth male, only 1 n spermatozoa were detected and their motility was vigorous. When eggs were fertilized with such 1 n spermatozoa, normal larvae hatched. 1 n spermatozoa of the triploid hybrid male only included the M. anguillicaudatus genome. In Misgurnus fishes, diploid hybrid males exhibited <b>semi-sterility</b> or slight fertility. On the contrary, triploid hybrid males were sometime fertile due to the production of 1 n spermatozoa by a kind of transformation of meiosis like meiotic hybridogenesis...|$|E
