Specifically, {{we focus on}} investment in <b>setup</b> <b>operations,</b> investment in quality improvement, and market dependent products such as substitutes and complements. We examine various impacts of investment and competition on inventory policies and derive managerial insights and economic implications. Throughout this dissertation, deterministic mathematical programming is used as the primary analysis technique and optimal policies are obtained through this technique;For the inventory and investment relationships, we construct and analyze inventory and investment in <b>setup</b> <b>operations</b> policies, inventory and investment in quality improvement policies, and inventory and capital investment allocation policies in setup and quality operations under ROI maximization. The resulting contributions are {{the establishment of an}} ROI model with/without the capital budget constraint and characterization of the unique global optimal solution when there exists an option to invest in <b>setup</b> <b>operations.</b> We also show how the inventory level is reduced when it is optimal to invest additional money in <b>setup</b> <b>operations</b> and/or quality improvement;For the inventory and competition relationships, on the other hand, we design and analyze two duopoly models for two profit maximizing sellers when products are substitutes or complements. The resulting contributions are formulation of inventory and {{pricing policies}} for substitutes and complements. Furthermore, we obtain the closed-form inventory and pricing policies at equilibrium when symmetric demand and cost are assumed...|$|E

40|$|In September 2007, {{a team of}} {{scientists}} and engineers from several NASA centers participated in a field exercise at Meteor Crater, Arizona. The tests in this field exercise utilized recently developed robots of varying scales and capabilities and humans in pressurized space suits. Two examples of operations performed in the field are presented: a surface operations scenario involving suited crew supported by a number of mobile robots and <b>setup</b> <b>operations</b> for accessing a crater. The surface operations scenario simulated the end of a crew sortie and involved the following agents: 1) Suit subjects from Johnson Space Center s (JSC) advanced spacesuit laboratory 2) JSC's unpressurized crewed rover testbed, SCOUT 3) The Jet Propulsion Laboratory s (JPL) rough terrain, payload carrying robot, ATHLETE 4) JSC's Astronaut assist robot, Robonaut 5) Ames Research Center's (ARC) inspection robot, K- 10. Operations began with ATHLETE positioning a pressurized rover compartment (PRC) as two crew members drove the SCOUT unpressurized rover from the field. The crew dismounted SCOUT, walked to the PRC for recharging. Robonaut then removed a sample box from the SCOUT equipment tray. K- 10 then performed a drive around inspection of SCOUT, assembling a mosaic image. Lastly, the SCOUT vehicle was remotely driven to the next site. The <b>setup</b> <b>operations</b> for crater access scenario involved ATHLETE and Robonaut. This scenario began with Robonaut approaching ATHLETE and extracting a tether line.

However, layer-based removal processing from different rotary positions can be inefficient due to double-coverage of certain volumes.

30|$|Third, {{especially}} in process-related industries, {{there is often}} a natural sequence in which the various products are to be produced to minimize total changeover time and to maintain product quality standards. For example, setups are sequenced from products with high to low purity requirements, from the lower taste of a food product to the stronger, or from the brighter colour of a product to the darker (Lütke Entrup et al. 2005). Hence, families of products can be identified which are produced in a given sequence under the same basic equipment setup. In this case, major setups are incurred for changing over between product families while only minor setups are needed for switching to another product within the same family. Hence, lot-sizing models need to reflect the nature of setup drivers and the corresponding hierarchy of <b>setup</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|E
