60|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> him, fascinated, {{and made}} a slight affirmative {{movement}} of the hand.|$|E
60|$|Fortunately {{she seemed}} to expect no answer to this query. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the wall with unseeing eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{came here}} to see you," [...] he said, [...] "--you." [...] <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> him now, in horror. [...] "And if you don't give me what I want, I cal'late to see some one else--in there," [...] said Mr. Hopper.|$|E
50|$|There {{is always}} a charming smile in her face. It really feels like <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> us if we kneel {{in front of her}} to pray.|$|R
60|$|But the fan dropped: {{her arms}} lay limp in her lap; and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> up <b>at</b> me piteously, {{with a world}} of self-reproach in her {{beautiful}} eyes.|$|R
50|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> Juan’s mother. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> wooed into {{marriage}} to Pedro by Sedano {{who said he}} thought of nothing but her all day and night and that her eyes were beautiful. Pedro owed her family the most money {{of all the other}} families, and her sisters had already moved to the city. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> married to annul the debt. Later, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> a buzzard and wishes to be like it so that she could fly to her sister in the city. Pedro gets mad enough and dismisses her for good. They are never officially divorced. Her dying wish is for Juan to go and see his father and “make him pay for all those years he put us out of his mind".|$|R
6000|$|... "Just curious." [...] He studied her. She {{had taken}} off her coat, tossing it over {{the end of the}} cot. She was young, about twenty. Slim. Her long hair {{stretched}} out over the pillow. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> him silently, her eyes dark and large.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am in {{love with}} your sister; but in love, Charlotte--in love!" [...] the young man pursued. Charlotte had laid her work in her lap; her hands were tightly folded on top of it; <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the carpet. [...] "In short, I 'm in love, dear lady," [...] said Felix. [...] "Now I want you to help me." ...|$|E
6000|$|The room {{seemed to}} swim around him. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> him, {{but he could}} see in her vacant eyes that she had no {{conception}} of his secret, nor knew the extent of her revelation. Duffy had not dared to tell all! He burst into a coarse laugh. [...] "What matters Duffy or the silly woman he'd try to steal away from other men." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, they're not so bad," [...] {{was all he}} answered. He {{pretended that}} his hand was the cat and hers the mouse. For {{the first time she}} tolerated him rather than {{encouraged}} him. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> out <b>at</b> Schoenstrom, a hamlet of perhaps a hundred and fifty inhabitants, at which the train was stopping.|$|R
25|$|Thérèse {{was sitting}} in a low chair, {{to the right of the}} fireplace. Chin in hand, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> fixedly <b>at</b> the dancing flames, and did not turn her head when Laurent entered the room. Wearing a lace-edged {{petticoat}} and bed-jacket, she looked particularly pale in the bright firelight. Her jacket had slipped from one shoulder which showed pink through the locks of her black hair.|$|R
6000|$|Even the rooming-house worm {{was making}} small {{worm-like}} sounds that presaged turning. Lee Theresa snapped just in time, [...] "Oh, cut it out, Ma, will you!" [...] <b>She</b> had <b>been</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the worm, {{for he had}} suddenly become interesting and adorable and, incidentally, an heir. [...] "I don't see why Mr. Wrenn ain't giving us all the notice we can expect. He said he mightn't be going for a long time." ...|$|R
60|$|The suddenness and {{completeness}} of {{the discovery}} threw the housekeeper, practiced dissembler as she was, completely off her guard. She started {{at the sight of}} the dress. The instant afterward her eyes turned uneasily toward Mrs. Wragge. Had the start been observed? It had passed entirely unnoticed. Mrs. Wragge's whole attention was fixed on the Alpaca dress: <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> it incomprehensibly, with an expression of the utmost dismay.|$|E
60|$|They stood up; {{he shook}} hands with them; and was {{suddenly}} aware that the door was open, and Noel standing there. He had heard no sound; and how long she had been there he could not tell. There was a singular fixity in her face and attitude. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the girl, who, as she passed, lifted her face, so that the dark eyes and the grey eyes met. The door was shut, and Noel stood there alone with him.|$|E
60|$|Fortunately as {{he peered}} {{cautiously}} round the room, M. le duc {{caught sight of}} his daughter. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> him--wide-eyed, her lips bloodless, her cheeks the colour of ashes. He looked but the ghost now of that proud aristocrat who {{little more than a}} week ago was the centre of a group of courtiers round the person of the heir to the English throne. Starved, emaciated, livid, he was the shadow of his former self, and there was a haunted look in his purple-rimmed eyes which spoke with pathetic eloquence of sleepless nights and of a soul tortured with remorse.|$|E
5000|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> up <b>at</b> me. [...] "He's {{burning up}} a dictionary?""Right. That's nothing. Once he burned up a {{cookbook}} because it said {{to remove the}} hide from a ham end before putting it in the pot with lima beans. Which he loves most, food or words, is a tossup." [...] Archie, explaining Wolfe's reaction to a dictionary that allows the use of [...] "imply" [...] in place of [...] "infer," [...] in Gambit, chapter 1.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look to yourself, Abiram; {{and spare}} your breath, {{if you can}} use it only to frighten the woman and her huddling girls. You have whitened the face of Ellen Wade, already; who looks as pale as if <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> to-day <b>at</b> the very Indians you name, when I was forced to speak to her through the rifle, because I couldn't reach her ears with my tongue. How was it, Nell! you have never given the reason of your deafness?" ...|$|R
60|$|Dea Flavia {{had thrown}} {{herself on the}} couch on her back; her arms were folded behind her head, her fair hair lay in heavy masses on the {{embroidered}} coverlet. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> straight up <b>at</b> the ceiling, her blue eyes wide open, and a puzzled frown across her brow.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked up}} at his wife, and {{whatever}} {{he was going to}} add remained unspoken. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> him with her big, slanting eyes, that seemed to him twice their natural size. The child, its dirty little face pressed to its mother's shoulder, was sleeping peacefully. The deep silence of the house was not broken, but rather accentuated, by the low mutter of the cockatoo, now very still on its perch. As Willems was looking at Joanna her upper lip was drawn up on one side, giving to her melancholy face a vicious expression altogether new to his experience. He stepped back in his surprise.|$|E
60|$|He {{did not say}} anything. He {{waited for}} her to explain why she wanted to see him. The look of the room told him clearly enough that she had gone back to the life from which he had taken her. He {{wondered}} {{what had happened to the}} baby; there was a photograph of it on the chimney-piece, but no sign in the room that a child was ever there. Mildred was holding her handkerchief. She made it into a little ball, and passed it from hand to hand. He saw that she was very nervous. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the fire, and he could look at her without meeting her eyes. She was much thinner than when she had left him; and the skin, yellow and dryish, was drawn more tightly over her cheekbones. She had dyed her hair and it was now flaxen: it altered her a good deal, and made her look more vulgar.|$|E
6000|$|Perry {{spoke to}} him, {{and pulled him}} up in the bed. He woke with a scream. He stared at his trainer in vacant terror, and spoke to his trainer in wild words. [...] "What are your horrid eyes looking at over my shoulder?" [...] he cried out. [...] "Go to the devil--and take your infernal slate with you!" [...] Perry spoke to him once more. [...] "You've been dreaming of somebody, Mr. Delamayn. What's to do about a slate?" [...] Geoffrey looked eagerly round the room, and heaved a heavy breath of relief. [...] "I could have sworn <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> me over the dwarf pear-trees," [...] he said. [...] "All right, I know where I am now." [...] Perry (attributing the dream to nothing more {{important}} than a passing indigestion) administered some brandy and water, and left him to drop off again to sleep. He fretfully forbade the extinguishing of the light. [...] "Afraid of the dark?" [...] said Perry, with a laugh. No. He was afraid of dreaming again of the dumb cook at Windygates House.|$|E
60|$|In {{the center}} of a group of expensive-looking people stood Mother, {{gorgeous}} in a gown like a herald's cloth-of-gold tabard. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> as magnificent as one of the larger chairs in a New York hotel lobby. Her hair <b>was</b> waved. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> coldly <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> Harris through a platinum lorgnon. Round her were the élite of Lipsittsville--the set that wore dinner coats and drove cars. A slim and pretty girl in saffron-colored silk bowed elaborately. A tall man with an imperial chuckled.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{arriving}} <b>at</b> work, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> seen <b>staring</b> flirtatiously <b>at</b> {{her boss}} (played by actor Leon Ockenden), {{who is in}} his room. She stops by her boss's room to hand him the folders he had previously asked her to take care of, and then proceeds to behave provocatively around him.|$|R
50|$|One of the 'True Eleven', {{her power}} is glamour (specifically vanishing, like Barry). However, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{much better than}} Barry at being invisible, as <b>she</b> <b>is</b> less clumsy and can move about quietly. It <b>is</b> {{mentioned}} that <b>she</b> often appears by the elbows of other students and remarks on books which they <b>are</b> reading. <b>She</b> often gets Barry into trouble in lessons, but never gets into trouble as much herself, due {{to the ability to}} look innocent. In the last book, Gideon claims that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> attracted to Dax as <b>she</b> <b>is</b> seen <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> him and blushes whenever he comes nearby.|$|R
6000|$|... "I obey, dear lady," [...] {{said the}} Cavaliere; and with another smile and bow to Rowland he departed, walking very discreetly on his toes. Rowland out-stayed him but a short time, {{for he was}} not fond of Mrs. Light, and he found nothing very inspiring in her frank intimation that if he chose, he might become a favorite. He was disgusted with himself for {{pleasing}} her; he confounded his fatal urbanity. In the court-yard of the palace he overtook the Cavaliere, who had stopped at the porter's lodge {{to say a word}} to his little girl. She was a young lady of very tender years and she wore a very dirty pinafore. He had taken her up in his arms and was singing an infantine rhyme to her, and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> him with big, soft Roman eyes. On seeing Rowland he put her down with a kiss, and stepped forward with a conscious grin, an unresentful admission that he was sensitive both to chubbiness and ridicule. Rowland began to pity him again; he had taken his dismissal from the drawing-room so meekly.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{big eyes}} she has," [...] {{he said to}} himself amazed. No wonder. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> him with all the might of her soul {{awakening}} slowly from a poisoned sleep, in which it could only quiver with pain but could neither expand nor move. He plunged into them breathless and tense, deep, deep, like a mad sailor taking a desperate dive from the masthead into the blue unfathomable sea so many men have execrated and loved at the same time. And his vanity was immense. It had been touched to the quick by that muscular little feminist, Fyne. [...] "I! I! Take advantage of her helplessness. I! Unfair to that creature--that wisp of mist, that white shadow homeless in an ugly dirty world. I could blow her away with a breath," [...] he was saying to himself with horror. [...] "Never!" [...] All the supremely refined delicacy of tenderness, expressed in so many fine lines of verse by Carleon Anthony, grew {{to the size of a}} passion filling with inward sobs the big frame of the man who had never in his life read a single one of those famous sonnets singing of the most highly civilised, chivalrous love, of those sonnets which ... You know there's a volume of them. My edition has the portrait of the author at thirty, and when I showed it to Mr Powell the other day he exclaimed: [...] "Wonderful! One would think this the portrait of Captain Anthony himself if..." [...] I wanted to know what that if was. But Powell could not say. There was something--a difference. No doubt there was--in fineness perhaps. The father, fastidious, cerebral, morbidly shrinking from all contacts, could only sing in harmonious numbers of what the son felt with a dumb and reckless sincerity.|$|E
50|$|When Sam Taylor {{arrived in}} Charnham, looking for Bar work in May 2004, little did Eileen know <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the son {{she had given}} away. It wasn't until an {{argument}} caused by Sam's clumsiness that the truth was revealed. Lucy, who had taken a liking to Sam was disgusted when she found he was her half-brother. Eileen revealed to Sam that Mike was his father.|$|E
5000|$|In an October 22, 2013 Nightwatch Radio interview, Zeena {{explains}} how she incorporated mantras {{as a medium}} and art form for the performance. David Sanderson described the event, [...] "Jingling bells and padded footsteps echoed in the darkness. The curtains silently parted, dramatically revealing an electrified, vermilion environment. Dead center, with hands held in the Mudra position, stood the seemingly twenty-foot tall goddess Zeena. With a painted gong behind her, Bharoocha and Hermund adorned her sides. Bharoocha lit incense that swept through the audience as Zeena’s commanding gaze pierced us all (everyone I talked to after the show swore <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> directly <b>at</b> them)." ...|$|R
50|$|The video {{begins with}} Jepsen spying on her {{attractive}} tattooed neighbour (Holden Nowell) {{as he is}} working on his lawn. As he takes his shirt off and notices <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> him, Jepsen slips on her high heels and falls below her window. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> reading the books Love at First Sight (Men In Uniform) by B.J. Daniels and Skylar's Outlaw by Linda Warren. The scene then cuts to her garage, where <b>she</b> <b>is</b> rehearsing the track with her band. Following the rehearsals, her bandmates push her to go and wash her car, where she tries to gain her neighbour's attention with various provocative poses only to fall from the hood of the car. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> briefly knocked out from the fall, during which she dreams of a romance novel-type encounter with her crush against the backdrop of Peggys Cove. As she comes to, the neighbour then helps her to get up, and watches the band rehearse the track again. After turning and writing down her telephone number, Jepsen sees her neighbour pass one of her male bandmates (Tavish Crowe) his own number, indicating he doesn't like women at all and is gay, where the very end shows that Jepsen is shocked by this. The video received three nominations on the 2012 MuchMusic Video Awards in the categories of UR Fave Video, Pop Video of the Year, and Video of the Year.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was a {{very hot}} day in July, and she fell asleep on a seat under a tree with her glass ball in her lap; <b>she</b> had <b>been</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> it, I suppose. Any way she slept on, till the sun went round and shone full on the ball; and just as he, Mr. Jephson, that is, came into the gate, the glass ball began {{to act like a}} burning glass and her skirt began to smoke. Well, he waited a bit, I think, till the skirt blazed a little, and then he rushed up and threw his coat over her skirt, and put the fire out. And so he saved her from being a Molochaust, like you read about in the bible.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Dylan {{had this}} to say about his girlfriend Suze's mother: [...] "Mary, though, who worked as a {{translator}} for medical journals, wasn't having it. Mary lived on the top floor of an apartment building on Sheridan Square and treated me like I had the clap. If she would have had her way, the cops would have locked me up. Suze's mom was a small feisty woman-volatile with black eyes like twin coals that could burn a hole through you, was very protective. Always make you feel like you did something wrong. She thought I had a nameless way of life and would never be able to support anybody, but I think it went much deeper than that. I think I just came in at a bad time. She glared at me, cigarette in her mouth. She was always trying to goad me into some kind of argument. My presence was so displeasing to her, but it's not like I'd caused any trouble in her life. It wasn't me who was responsible for the loss of Suze's father or anything. Once I said to her that I didn't think she was being fair. She stared squarely into my eyes like <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> some distant, visible object and said to me, 'Do me a favor, don't think when I'm around.' Suze would tell me later that she didn't mean it. She did mean it, though. She did everything in her power to keep us apart, but we went on seeing each other anyway." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Longest Reverse in the World: A {{straight}} 1.0 km lane {{is set up}} {{with various}} obstacles on the sides, including cars, concrete barriers, wooden boxes and foam shapes, getting a little wider with each section. The candidates are given one chance to reverse down the entire course in the 19 ft long 1976 Cadillac Calais. The drivers are each told to take it {{as fast as they}} reasonably can, but to do it safely. Polly quickly starts hitting things, thanks to her over-steering and veering toward the driver's side, something that Andrew and the experts note is unusual given {{that the vast majority of}} bad drivers usually hit on the passenger side. At the end, she admits that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the driver's side obstacles rather than where she wanted to go. Sholom has a similar set of issues, over-steering and looking from side-to-side rather than at the end of the course, and he posts a similarly poor run. Renee does well for most of her run, but gets increasingly flustered, eventually causing her to leave the course altogether and nearly hit the camera car. Jordan has the best run of the day, only hitting two objects late in the course. Jillian starts off well, but her run rapidly falls apart after she hits a parked car early on. Despite the best efforts of Andrew and Mitchell, she becomes overwhelmed with stress, and ends up hitting a lot of things during her run. After this, Andrew decides to send her on a public drive with Tim, and for the most part she proves far less nervous than she did during the previous episode's public drive, even though she gets nervous while handling lane changes.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him steadily. She {{looked at him}} with a sort of queenly woodenness, as if he were behind a camera with a velvet bag over his head and had just told her to moisten the lips with the tip of the tongue. Her aspect {{staggered}} Lord Dawlish. A cursory inspection of his conscience showed nothing but purity and whiteness, but he must have done something, or <b>she</b> would not <b>be</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> him like this.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Single" [...] was {{directed}} by Jake Nava and premiered on 26 March 2004 in the United Kingdom. The video features four sequences. It begins with Bedingfield waking up and {{getting ready to go}} out. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> then shown walking down the street past various shops, stopping at a photo booth to take photographs with a guy she had met on the street. Dressed in jeans and a silver jacket, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> next shown performing a choreographed dance with three female dancers in an underground tunnel. The final sequence of the video features Bedingfield at a party sitting outside on a patio, singing to herself. As the video concludes, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> shown <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the camera as her image gradually fades.|$|R
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Lucky Day" [...] was {{directed}} by Stephen Agnes; it was filmed in New York City, on the East Village. During {{the production of the}} music video, they were not allowed to play music on the streets and so Roberts had to wear an ear piece with the track playing, of which <b>she</b> stated people <b>were</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> jumping around on the set with no music playing so people did not understand what <b>she</b> <b>was</b> doing. Roberts expressed her discomfort with the shoot due to the weather saying; ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{had so far}} {{moved as}} to find the nearest chair, and there <b>she</b> <b>was</b> now seated, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> her uncle with fixed eyes. [...] "Uncle," [...] she said, [...] "what does it mean?" [...] Then he came, and sitting beside her, he explained, as best he could, {{the story of her}} birth, and her kinship with the Scatcherds. [...] "And where is he, uncle?" [...] she said. [...] "Why does he not come to me?" ...|$|R
