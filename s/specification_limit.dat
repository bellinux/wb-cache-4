40|$|Abstract: In 1986 Taguchi {{presented}} the quadratic function for describing {{the loss of}} quality due to deviation from the production value. The objective then is to improve quality by minimizing the quadratic loss function which reflects the loss of both, the producer and the consumer. Subsequently, Kapur et al. (1987, 1988, 1994) addressed the problem of deriving a loss function to be applied for determining the design of <b>specification</b> <b>limits.</b> This article further explores the problem of determining an integrated design of a Type I continuous sampling plan (CSP- 1) and the <b>specification</b> <b>limits.</b> By modifying Kapur and Wang’s (1987) model, we not only obtain economic <b>specification</b> <b>limits,</b> but also obtaib an optimal CSP- 1 plan for inspection.

50|$|Capability studies {{measure the}} number of {{standard}} deviations between the process mean and the nearest <b>specification</b> <b>limit</b> in sigma units, represented by the Greek letter σ (sigma). As process standard deviation goes up, or {{the mean of the}} process moves away {{from the center of the}} tolerance, fewer standard deviations will fit between the mean and the nearest <b>specification</b> <b>limit,</b> decreasing the sigma number and increasing the likelihood of items outside specification. One should also note that calculation of Sigma levels for a process data is independent of the data being normally distributed. In one of the criticisms to Six Sigma, practitioners using this approach spend a lot of time transforming data from non-normal to normal using transformation techniques. It must be said that Sigma levels can be determined for process data that has evidence of non-normality.|$|E
50|$|Experience {{has shown}} that {{processes}} usually do not perform {{as well in the}} long term as they do in the short term. As a result, the number of sigmas that will fit between the process mean and the nearest <b>specification</b> <b>limit</b> may well drop over time, compared to an initial short-term study. To account for this real-life increase in process variation over time, an empirically based 1.5 sigma shift is introduced into the calculation. According to this idea, a process that fits 6 sigma between the process mean and the nearest <b>specification</b> <b>limit</b> in a short-term study will in the long term fit only 4.5 sigma - either because the process mean will move over time, or because the long-term standard deviation of the process will be greater than that observed in the short term, or both.|$|E
