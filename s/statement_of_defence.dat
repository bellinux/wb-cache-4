5000|$|<b>Statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>defence</b> for Scudamore {{came from}} the likes of former FA chief {{executive}} Ian Watmore, who tweeted, [...] "Met loads of misogynists in football, Richard Scudamore not one of them. Helped me unblock opposition to FA Women's Super League." [...] The prominent journalist Martin Samuel also claimed that Greg Dyke and chair of the FA's inclusion advisory board Heather Rabbatts sent private texts of support to Scudamore, before publicly condemning him for political purposes. Karren Brady, West Ham's vice-chair, said she had known Scudamore for 20 years and he was [...] "categorically not sexist".|$|R
50|$|In Hemming v Newton, Hemming sued Newton for libel and {{defamation}} as {{a result}} of a posting and a story on a P2P website which was owned and moderated by Newton. The author of the posting was unknown, but Newton was the author of the story. Newton's <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>defence</b> alleged he was an innocent disseminator as he did not see or authorize the posting before it occurred and removed it in good faith upon receipt of Hemming’s complaint. Hemming asserted that it would be an abuse of process for Newton's <b>defence</b> <b>of</b> innocent dissemination to stand. The judge held that Newton had pleaded sufficient facts to enable Hemming to know why he contends he was an innocent disseminator, and refused to strike out the defence.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>defence,</b> filed February 19, 2016 argues {{the concept}} itself is nothing new, and {{therefore}} the suit should be dismissed: “Interactive, three-dimensional signs bearing {{the name of a}} city are commonplace around the world.

5000|$|Dave Hancock, then Government House Leader, invoked closure, “imposing severe {{limitations}} on debate ... allowing Bill 46 {{to be passed}} extremely quickly,” the statement says. The union also claims in the lawsuit that the bill creates an environment where good-faith bargaining is impossible. “Furthermore, free collective bargaining cannot take place within the long shadow cast by Bill 46,” the statement of claim says. Statements of claim contain allegations that are not proven in court. A <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>defence</b> {{has not yet been}} filed.|$|E
60|$|Captain Willoughby did not object, {{though he}} {{reminded}} Joyce that the desertions had probably put {{the enemy in}} possession <b>of</b> a minute <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> their <b>defences</b> and force, including {{the history of the}} wooden gun. If Joel and his fellow-delinquents had joined the party at the mill, the name, age, character and spirit of every man remaining in the garrison were probably known to its leaders; and neither quakers nor paddies would count for much in opposing an assault.|$|R
500|$|Cibber's {{colourful}} autobiography An Apology for the Life of Colley Cibber, Comedian (1740) was chatty, meandering, anecdotal, vain, {{and occasionally}} inaccurate. At {{the time of}} writing the word [...] "apology" [...] meant an apologia, a <b>statement</b> in <b>defence</b> <b>of</b> one's actions rather than a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> regret for having transgressed.|$|R

50|$|In 2005, Calandra was {{involved}} in a family dispute. In the early 2000s, he had power of attorney to manage his mother's affairs. In a lawsuit filed by his sisters, it was claimed the power of attorney had been revoked by his mother months before her death in August 2005, but Calandra had invoked it for personal gain. In his <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>defence,</b> Calandra said that the charges had been authorized. A document filed on September 8, 2008, the first full day of the 2008 federal election campaign, said that the parties had settled the case out of court.|$|E
5000|$|In response, Ball filed {{a lawsuit}} against Johnson. Johnson's <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>defence</b> was {{provided}} by the Calgary Herald, which stated that Ball [...] "...never had a reputation in the scientific community as a noted climatologist and authority on global warming," [...] and that he [...] "...is viewed as a paid promoter of the agenda of {{the oil and gas industry}} rather than as a practicing scientist." [...] In the ensuing court case, Ball acknowledged that he had only been a professor for eight years, and that his doctorate was not in climatology but rather in geography, and subsequently withdrew the lawsuit on June 8, 2007.|$|E
50|$|On 19 January 2016, Colin Craig donated NZ$36,000 to the Conservative Party. Despite {{his lack}} of {{involvement}} with the leadership, he stated {{that he and his}} wife still wanted to support the Party financially. On 1 March 2016, it was reported that former Conservative board member John Stringer had dropped his defamation suit against Craig and would seek legal advice to ensure that his <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>defence</b> complied with court rules for defamation cases. In early April 2016, Craig tabled legal papers seeking more than $NZ13,000 in legal damages from blogger Cameron Slater for publishing his romantic poem The Two of Me relating to the former Conservative press secretary Rachel MacGregor on his blog Whale Oil the previous year.|$|E
5000|$|... "Sensitive" [...] is {{the second}} single by The Field Mice. It was {{released}} as a 7" [...] vinyl record on Sarah Records in February 1989, and included a fold-out poster depicting a leaf. Sensitive, on which the band's sound verged on shoegazing, {{has been described as}} [...] "an anthemic <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> purpose...a <b>defence</b> <b>of</b> feeling...and a comment on the way sensitivity is criticized, or punished even". The single reached number 12 in the UK Independent Chart in March that year. [...] "Sensitive" [...] was also voted at number 26 in the 1989 Festive 50. Both tracks from the single were later included on the CD reissue of the band's debut mini-album Snowball.|$|R

5000|$|The Fontaine Centre's {{executive}} members initially filed a joint <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>defence</b> {{in response}} to the federal government's civil suit. This unity collapsed in 2005, when Courchene, Lana Daniels and Keith Fontaine submitted that centre director Perry Fontaine and two federal officials had conspired for the deliberate misuse of public monies. Courchene, Daniels and Keith Fontaine sued Perry Fontaine and the federal government, and were in turn sued by Perry Fontaine. [...] In November 2005, the federal government further alleged that Ken Courchene, Steve Courchene, Keith Fontaine and Perry Fontaine were part of a conspiracy to defraud the federal government of $332,000 relating to the lease on a gym they claimed to own.|$|E
50|$|On 19 January 2016, Colin Craig donated NZ$36,000 to the Conservative Party. Despite {{his lack}} of {{involvement}} with the leadership, he stated {{that he and his}} wife still wanted to support the party financially. On 2 February 2016, the party's board validated the decision of the previous board to suspend John Stringer's membership. The suspension was part of an ongoing internal conflict within the party between Stringer and former party leader Craig. On 1 March 2016, it was reported that Stringer had dropped his defamation suit against Craig and was seeking legal advice to ensure that his <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>defence</b> complied with court rules for defamation cases. However, Craig's lawsuit against Stringer and Jordan Williams' lawsuit against Craig remained ongoing.|$|E
5000|$|Ezra Levant was {{successfully}} sued for libel by lawyer Khurrum Awan.According to his {{statement of claim}} and records of court proceedings, Awan claimed that Levant's blog writings had repeatedly described him as being: [...] "Khurrum Awan the liar", [...] "stupid, a [...] "fool", [...] "serial, malicious, money-grubbing liar", [...] "unequivocally implied {{that he was an}} anti-Semite and perjurer". Awan states that Levant also stated that Awan believes it is permissible to lie to further the cause of Islam. Awan claimed that as a result, he has [...] "suffered mental distress, humiliation and loss of professional reputation." [...] In his <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>defence,</b> Levant replied that [...] "any damage to Mr. Awan’s reputation was self-inflicted." [...] Levant declined comment but in an email described Awan as a [...] "master of lawfare" [...] who was engaged in [...] "an exceedingly political lawsuit." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the night}} of the 9 to 10 December, an {{incident}} between French forces and gunmen caused the death of two soldiers of the 8th RPIMa. According to the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> the French <b>Defence</b> Ministry, soon before midnight, a section of the Sangaris Force was attacked at short range by men equipment with light arms, during a patrol in Bangui. The patrol replied in kind. During the exchange of fire, the Privates First Class Nicolas Vokaer and Antoine Le Quinio sustained serious injuries; they were immediately cared for by their comrades and evacuated to the frontline surgical bay <b>of</b> the French <b>Defence</b> Health service at M’Poko Airport, where they died of their injuries.|$|R
50|$|The judges seem to {{have been}} {{dissatisfied}} with the effect of their former rules, for in 1883 they issued a fresh set of consolidated rules, which, with subsequent amendments, are those now in force. By these rules a further attempt was made to prune the exuberance of pleading. Concise forms <b>of</b> <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> claim and <b>defence</b> were given in the appendix for adoption by the pleader. It is true that these forms do not display a high standard of excellence in draftsmanship, and it was said that many of them were undoubtedly demurrable, but that was not of much importance.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{publications}} Kamm {{has contributed}} to include The Jewish Chronicle, for which he writes most months, Prospect magazine, and The Guardian. In Prospect in February 2016, he wrote that he had resigned from the Frontline Club after founder Vaughan Smith had given refuge to Julian Assange at the club. Kamm wrote that [...] "Smith’s <b>statement</b> in <b>defence</b> <b>of</b> his decision tellingly made not a single reference to the women Assange {{is alleged to have}} attacked." ...|$|R
5000|$|There {{was some}} exaggeration in both statements. In {{pursuing}} {{the fusion of}} law and equity which was the dominant legal idea of law reformers of that period, {{the framers of the}} first set of rules devised a system which they thought would meet the defects of both systems, and be appropriate for both the common-law and the chancery divisions. In a normal case, the plaintiff delivered his statement of claim, in which he was to set forth concisely the facts on which he relied, and the relief which he asked. The defendant then delivered his <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>defence,</b> in which he was to say whether he admitted or denied the plaintiff's facts (every averment not traversed being taken to be admitted), and any additional facts and legal defences on which he relied. The plaintiff might then reply, and the defendant rejoin, and so on until the pleaders had exhausted themselves. This system of pleading was not a bad one if accompanied by the right of either party to demur to his opponent's pleading, i.e. to say, [...] "admitting all your averments of fact to be true, you still have no cause of action", or [...] "defence" [...] (as the case may be).|$|E

5000|$|Gibson {{has been}} {{described}} as ‘one of that school of ecclesiastical historians… which {{in the late twentieth century}} has given fresh impetus and vitality to the revisionist view of the eighteenth-century Church...’ (John Guy in Journal of Welsh Religious History, 1997) Gibson’s championing of the ‘optimistic’ view of the eighteenth century Church has drawn criticism from historians. The debate has been most recently aired in Reviews in History (Institute of Historical Research London, http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/paper/snaperesp.html). His biography of Benjamin Hoadly, though generally well received, has been viewed as an overly strong <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> the optimist’s <b>defence</b> <b>of</b> a latitudinarian bishop (“a valuable if perhaps slightly overstated reappraisal of one of the foremost pillars of the Georgian religious establishment” -Robin Eagles ‘The Eighteenth Century’ in Annual Bulletin of Historical Literature, December 2006.) ...|$|R
40|$|Sidney’s <b>Defence</b> <b>of</b> Poesy {{was written}} {{at a time}} when poetry was looked down upon by critics in the English Renaissance. In his attempt to revive poetry as a genre and a mode of teaching, he makes use of many {{arguments}} relying on other scholars and writers to support his <b>statements.</b> The <b>Defence</b> <b>of</b> Poesy is divided into two parts, with the first part focusing on the values of philosophy, history and poetry as a means of deriving knowledge and virtue, while the second part is focused on the reasons for contempt towards poetry in Renaissance England. This essay focuses on the first part, examining Sidney’s arguments for poetry’s supreme purpose and place among other disciplines, paying particular attention to: the <b>defence</b> <b>of</b> poetry as prophecy, the eclectic scope <b>of</b> the <b>defence,</b> and the role of Plato’s and Aristotle’s philosophies in the work...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} paper deals generally {{with the}} linguistic {{research of the}} german language of law and more precisely - the texts written by lawyers. It presents the joint analysis of three successive written statements concerning a civil case - the statement of claim, the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>defence</b> and the replication. The aim is to give a linguistic description {{of this type of}} text including the analysis of the interaction between the parties reflected in the language of these texts. Therefore three levels of texts were taken into consideration - the macrostructure, the midistructure and the microstructure. The main part of the interaction takes place in the complex level of midistructure, on the one hand between the speech acts of each text, on the other hand as a progress of the topical structure, but the remaining levels are also influenced. The joint analysis of the three texts enables to observe similarities between such approach and the analysis of a spoken interaction, ie. a talk, discussion. Thus, it is an example of overcoming the division of the linguistic research into two fields - the linguistic of the spoken and written language...|$|E
