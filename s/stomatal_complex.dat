We have used transgenic plants carrying a 35 SGUS::Ac construct that produces clonal sectors to analyze the possible role of cell lineage during the establishment of stomatal patterning in Arabidopsis leaves. The analysis of sectors ranging from two to eighteen cells supports the conclusion that most <b>stomatal</b> <b>complexes</b> derive from a single and immediate precursor cell through a stereotyped pattern of three unequal cell divisions followed by a final equal one. In addition, it shows that the successive cell divisions take place at a constant angle (approximately 60 °) with respect to the previous one. Interestingly, this angular dimension shifts from 60 ° to 0 ° in the last cell division that gives rise to the stoma. These sectors also reveal the development of both clockwise and counterclockwise patterns of cell divisions during stomatal development in approximately equal numbers. Our clonal analysis indicates that cell divisions involved in the development of <b>stomatal</b> <b>complexes</b> are probably the last ones contributing to epidermal growth and development. Finally, the stereotyped pattern of cell divisions that culminates in the formation of <b>stomatal</b> <b>complexes</b> indicates that cell lineage plays a very important role during stomatal pattern establishment...|$|R
40|$|After {{transient}} {{exposure to}} the gaseous hormone ethylene, dark-grown cucumber (Cucumis sativus) hypocotyls developed unusual features. Upon ethylene’s removal, the developing epidermis showed significant increases in cell division rates, producing an abundance of guard cells and trichomes. These responses to ethylene depended {{on the stage of}} development at the time of ethylene exposure. In the upper region of the hypocotyl, where cells were least differentiated at the onset of ethylene treatment, complex, multicellular protuberances formed. Further down the hypocotyl, where stomata and trichomes were beginning to develop at the onset of ethylene exposure, {{an increase in the number}} of stomata and trichomes was observed. <b>Stomatal</b> <b>complexes</b> developing after the ethylene treatment had a significant increase in the number of stomatal subsidiary cells and the number of cells per trichome increased. Analysis of division patterns in <b>stomatal</b> <b>complexes</b> indicated that exposure to ethylene either suspended or altered cell fate. Ethylene also altered cell division polarity, resulting in aberrant <b>stomatal</b> <b>complexes</b> and branched trichomes. To our knowledge, the results of this study demonstrate for the first time that transient treatment with physiological concentrations of ethylene can alter cell fate and increase the propensity of cells to divide.

5000|$|Transpiration is {{the process}} of water {{movement}} through a plant and its evaporation from aerial parts, such as leaves, stems and flowers. Water is necessary for plants but only a small amount of water taken up by the roots is used for growth and metabolism. The remaining 97-99.5% is lost by transpiration and guttation. Leaf surfaces are dotted with pores called stomata, and in most plants they are more numerous on the undersides of the foliage. The stomata are bordered by guard cells and their stomatal accessory cells (together known as <b>stomatal</b> <b>complex)</b> that open and close the pore. Transpiration occurs through the stomatal apertures, and {{can be thought of as}} a necessary [...] "cost" [...] associated with the opening of the stomata to allow the diffusion of carbon dioxide gas from the air for photosynthesis. Transpiration also cools plants, changes osmotic pressure of cells, and enables mass flow of mineral nutrients and water from roots to shoots. Two major factors influence the rate of water flow from the soil to the roots: the hydraulic conductivity of the soil and the magnitude of the pressure gradient through the soil. Both of these factors influence the rate of bulk flow of water moving from the roots to the stomatal pores in the leaves via the xylem.|$|E
40|$|MicroRNAs have {{important}} {{functions in the}} development of eukaryotes. In plants, highly conserved miRNA families have been shown to regulate morphogenesis and organ identity, primarily by targeting cleavage of mRNAs encoding transcription factors. Cloning identified a 21 nt Arabidopsis miRNA, miR 824, conserved in Brassica species, but not in more distantly related species. miR 824 is encoded at a single genetic locus as a polyadenylated, primary miRNA that is spliced and then processed via a precursor miRNA intermediate. miR 824 mediates cleavage of the AGAMOUS-LIKE 16 (AGL 16) mRNA. AGL 16 {{is a member of the}} MADS-box protein family. The plant-specific MADS-box protein family has many established functions in regulating growth and development. Impairing the miR 824 -mediated repression of AGL 16 leads to leaf abnormalities and growth defects raising the possibility that AGL 16 has pleiotropic function in leaf developmental programs. This study shows that the density and development of <b>stomatal</b> <b>complexes</b> on the epidermis of Arabidopsis leaves depend, in part, on microRNA-mediated regulation of AGL 16 assigning a novel function for the MADSbox protein family. Mutants deficient in AGL 16 and transgenics overexpressing miR 824 show decrease in stomatal density and developed only primary <b>stomatal</b> <b>complexes.</b> Ectopic expression of a miR 824 -resistant AGL 16 mRNA, but not of the wild-type AGL 16 mRNA in transgenic plants, increases the stomatal density and the incidence of higher-order <b>stomatal</b> <b>complexes.</b> These results and the localization of AGL 16 mRNA and miR 824 in mature stomata and satellite meristemoids, respectively, leads to the conclusion that miR 824 /AGL 16 pathway functions in stomatal development.

40|$|Caffeine {{treatment}} of growing wheat tissues {{was used to}} form binucleate or polyploid cells; preprophase microtubules in subsequent division cycles in these and some other abnormal cells were then examined. In root tips, binucleate cells or those with greatly enlarged nuclei usually contained one transverse preprophase band of microtubules; sometimes this was slightly asymmetrical or skew, and less commonly two bands were seen. In coleoptile vascular bundles, there were generally two or more bands in the greatly elongated cells, these sometimes appearing in different planes. During formation of the <b>stomatal</b> <b>complexes,</b> preprophase microtubules were almost invariably found where expected, preceding abnormal development both in untreated and also in caffeine-treated material, regardless of the number, disposition or size of nuclei. This occurred even when wall stumps, formed during a previous abortive division, indicated that that previous division was also asymmetrical. It is concluded that the position(s) of preprophase band(s) of microtubules is not particularly influenced by the nucleus or nuclei, being more susceptible to external morphogenetic influences which can persist for some considerable time.

We show that the density and development of <b>stomatal</b> <b>complexes</b> on the epidermis of Arabidopsis thaliana leaves depend, in part, on the microRNA-mediated regulation of Agamous-like 16 (AGL 16), which {{is a member of}} the MADS box protein family. AGL 16 mRNA is targeted for sequence-specific degradation by miR 824, a recently evolved microRNA conserved in the Brassicaceae and encoded at a single genetic locus.

Expression of a miR 824 -resistant AGL 16 mRNA, but not the wild-type AGL 16 mRNA, in transgenic plants increased the incidence of stomata in higher-order complexes. By contrast, reduced expression of AGL 16 mRNA in the agl 16 - 1 deficiency mutant and in transgenic lines overexpressing miR 824 decreased the incidence of stomata in higher-order complexes.

40|$|Stomata, the {{microscopic}} pores {{on the surface}} of the aerial parts of plants, are bordered by two specialized cells, known as guard cells, which control the stomatal aperture according to endogenous and environmental signals. Like most movements occurring in plants, the opening and closing of stomata are based on hydraulic forces. During opening, the activation of plasma membrane and tonoplast transporters results in solute accumulation in the guard cells. To re-establish the perturbed osmotic equilibrium, water follows the solutes into the cells, leading to their swelling. Numerous studies have contributed to the understanding of the mechanism and regulation of stomatal movements. However, despite the importance of transmembrane water flow during this process, only a few studies have provided evidence for the involvement of water channels, called aquaporins. Here, we microdissected Zea mays <b>stomatal</b> <b>complexes</b> and showed that members of the aquaporin plasma membrane intrinsic protein (PIP) subfamily are expressed in these complexes and that their mRNA expression generally follows a diurnal pattern. The substrate specificity of two of the expressed ZmPIPs, ZmPIP 1; 5 and ZmPIP 1; 6, was investigated by heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes and yeast cells. Our data show that both isoforms facilitate transmembrane water diffusion in the presence of the ZmPIP 2; 1 isoform. In addition, both display CO 2 permeability comparable to that of the CO 2 diffusion facilitator NtAQP 1.

The microtubule cytoskeletal structure of plant cells was visualized concomitantly with a monoclonal antibody specific for [alpha]-tubulin. We found that the cdc 2 protein is localized mainly to the nucleus in plant cells at interphase and early prophase. This finding contrasts markedly with the predominantly cytoplasmic staining obtained using antibody to the PSTAIRE motif, which is common to cdc 2 and numerous cdc 2 -like proteins. In a subpopulation of root cells at early prophase, the p 34 cdc 2 protein is also distributed in a band bisecting the nucleus. Double labeling with the maize p 34 cdc 2 Zm antibody and tubulin antibody revealed that this band colocalizes with the preprophase band (PPB) of microtubules, which predicts the future division site. Root cells in which microtubules had been disrupted with oryzalin did not contain this band of p 34 cdc 2 protein, suggesting that formation of the microtubule PPB is necessary for localization of the p 34 cdc 2 kinase to {{the plane of the}} PPB.

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 In Pisum, the Np gene {{conditions}} two mitotic responses - to bruchid weevil oviposition on the pod and {{to reduced}} UV light. Oviposition by the weevil results in tumorous or neoplastic growth under the egg. Biochemically active compounds, called bruchins, were isolated from two bruchid insects (Doss et al, 2000). Femtomolar concentrations of bruchin result in {{programmed cell death}} (PCD) and neoplasm formation on the pod at the application site. PCD is evident at the application site within four hours and a large (several mg) neoplasm in five to seven days. Low UV light results in growth of neoplasm, termed spontaneous neoplasm (SN), over the entire surface of the pod and, as with bruchin application, appears to begins with PCD followed by mitosis. Genotypes containing np/np do not develop SN and respond only weakly to bruchin. Both responses conditioned by Np initiate at the <b>stomatal</b> <b>complex</b> and are first detected by increased auto-fluorescence. In both cases, this is accompanied by increased peroxide/peroxidase activity first at the stomata, then radiating outward across the epidermal surface and into the mesophyll cells. Nuclei in the epidermis stained strongly for peroxide/peroxidase within 3 h of bruchin application. Nuclei in the mesophyll stained for peroxide/peroxidase by 24 h. Rose Bengal, which generates singlet oxygen, stimulated site-specific neoplasm formation on greenhouse grown pods. Lanthanum, an inhibitor of Ca 2 + influx, inhibited both ROS production and bruchin action. ZnCl 2 inhibited ROS production and bruchin response less effectively than LaCl 3. Epidermal cell death demonstrated hallmarks of apoptosis. TUNEL demonstrated the presence of oligonucleosomal fragmentation, which is associated with PCD. Pods treated with bruchin demonstrated progressive TUNEL staining. The first areas to test positive for endogenous nuclease activity were the subsidiary cells of the <b>stomatal</b> <b>complex.</b> Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) found nuclear blebbing, chromatin condensation, mitochondrial swelling, changes in cytosol density and increased vacuolization.

Dioscorea dumetorum has tetracytic and paractytic stomata, with percentage frequency values of 91. 05 and 8. 95, respectively. Both D. esculenta and D. rotundata have paracytic stomata, with a percentage frequency of 100. The range of variation of stomatal density is from 10 (lowest value) in D. alata and D. dumentorum to 27 (highest value) in D. bulbifera. The stomatal index also varies, from 24 in D. alata to 47 in D. cayenensis. The size of stomata in all species is small, varying in length from 0. 74 µm in D. alata to 1. 79 µm in D. dumentorum. An indented dichotomous key based on stomatal features was constructed to distinguish {{and identify the}} species...|$|E
40|$|Plant {{development}} {{has a significant}} postembryonic phase that is guided heavily by interactions between the plant and the outside environment. This interplay is particularly evident in the development, pattern and function of stomata, epidermal pores on the aerial surfaces of land plants. Stomata {{have been found in}} fossils dating from more than 400 million years ago. Strikingly, the morphology of the individual <b>stomatal</b> <b>complex</b> is largely unchanged, but the sizes, numbers and arrangements of stomata and their surrounding cells have diversified tremendously. In many plants, stomata arise from specialized and transient stem-cell like compartments on the leaf. Studies in the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana have established a basic molecular framework for the acquisition of cell fate and generation of cell polarity in these compartments, as well as describing some of the key signals and receptors required to produce stomata in organized patterns and in environmentally optimized numbers. Here we present parallel analyses of stomatal developmental pathways at morphological and molecular levels and describe the innovations made by particular clades of plants...|$|E

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the leaf blade {{anatomical}} structures of the broad-leaved fescue taxa, natural populations of temperate forage grasses, collected from various habitats in Central Europe. The following anatomical features were examined and quantitatively characterised: the ribs of leaves, type of the mesophyll, number of the sclerenchyma ribs, quantity of sclerenchyma tissue, presence of the colourless cells, number of bulliform cells, <b>stomatal</b> <b>complexes</b> and presence of papilla number. It was concluded that the anatomical structures and the main leaf blade characteristics of broad-leaved fescues show several differences between the taxa of Schenodorus and Drymanthele subgenus. The populations of the Schenodorus subgenus present heterogeneous mesophyll, with radial parenchyma, and colourless cells. Strong correlations exist between the bulliform cells and the quantity of sclerenchyma and papillae. The populations of Drymanthele subgenus also present heterogeneous mesophyll, {{but this is not}} evident for every taxa and populations. The radial parenchyma and the colourless cells are not specific. There is a positive correlation between the bulliform cells and the quantity of sclerenchyma. The comparative leaf anatomical analysis, could contribute to the better understanding of taxonomic and anatomical diversity in this group...|$|R
40|$|The {{movement}} of guard cells in <b>stomatal</b> <b>complexes</b> controls water loss and CO 2 uptake in plants. Examination of the dual-affinity nitrate transporter gene AtNRT 1. 1 (CHL 1) revealed {{that it is}} expressed and functions in Arabidopsis guard cells. CHL 1 promoter–β-glucuronidase and CHL 1 promoter–green fluorescent protein constructs showed strong expression in guard cells, and immunolocalization experiments with anti-CHL 1 antibody confirmed these results. To assess CHL 1 function, chl 1 mutant plants grown {{in the presence of}} nitrate were examined. Compared with wild-type plants, chl 1 mutants had reduced stomatal opening and reduced transpiration rates in the light or when deprived of CO 2 in the dark. These effects result in enhanced drought tolerance in chl 1 mutants. At the cellular level, chl 1 mutants showed reduced nitrate accumulation in guard cells during stomatal opening and failed to show nitrate-induced depolarization of guard cells. In wild-type guard cells, nitrate induced depolarization, and nitrate concentrations increased threefold during stomatal opening. These results identify an anion transporter that functions in stomatal opening and demonstrate that CHL 1 supports stomatal function in the presence of nitrate...|$|R
40|$|Ubiquitous, large {{diameter}} pores {{have not}} previously been adequately demonstrated {{to occur in}} leaf cuticles. Here we show conclusively that such structures occur in Eidothea zoexylocarya, a rainforest tree species of Proteaceae restricted to the Australian Wet Tropics. The pores are abundant, large-diameter apertures (1 um), that extend perpendicularly {{most of the way}} through the cuticle from the inside. They occur {{on both sides of the}} leaf, but are absent from the cuticle associated with <b>stomatal</b> <b>complexes</b> on the abaxial side. No such pores were found in any other species, including the only other species of Eidothea, E. hardeniana from New South Wales, and other species that have previously been purported to possess cuticular pores. To determine whether these pores made the cuticles more leaky to water vapor, we measured astomatous cuticular conductances to water vapor for E. zoexylocarya and seven other Proteaceae species of the Wet Tropics. Cuticular conductance for E. zoexylocarya was relatively low, indicating that the prominent pores do not increase conductance. The function of the pores is currently obscure, but the presence of both pores and an adaxial hypodermis in E. zoexylocarya but not E. hardeniana suggests evolution in response to greater environmental stresses in the tropics...|$|R
