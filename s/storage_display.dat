40|$|Increasing <b>storage</b> and <b>display</b> {{temperature}} {{and time of}} ground beef significantly increased microbial counts but lean level had no effect. Prolonged storage at abusive temperatures (48 °F) caused up to 90 % unacceptable chubs and aerobic bacteria counts as high as 7. 7 log 10 CFU/g, which would render chubs unsatisfactory for further processing, packaging and sale. Thus, ground beef chubs should be stored at 32 °F. and as briefly as possible to minimize pre- and post-display microbial counts. Maintaining both optimal <b>storage</b> and <b>display</b> temperatures is critical because combining abusive <b>storage</b> and <b>display</b> conditions resulted in the greatest microbial growth. Shelf life and wholesomeness benefits from maintaining cold (32 °F) <b>storage</b> and <b>display</b> temperatures are clearly demonstrated...|$|R

50|$|Some refresh vector {{displays}} use {{a normal}} phosphor that fades rapidly and needs constant refreshing 30-40 times per second {{to show a}} stable image. These displays such as the Imlac PDS-1 require some local refresh memory to hold the vector endpoint data. Other <b>storage</b> tube <b>displays</b> such as the popular Tektronix 4010 use a special phosphor that continues glowing for many minutes. <b>Storage</b> <b>displays</b> do not require any local memory. In the 1970s, both types of vector displays were much more affordable than bitmap raster graphics displays when megapixel computer memory was still very expensive. Today, raster displays have replaced nearly all uses of vector displays.|$|R

50|$|After {{graduating from}} Harvard University, Preston Remington (1897-1958) joined The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Department of Decorative Arts in 1923 as an {{assistant}} under curator Joseph Breck. He served {{for the remainder of}} his career as assistant curator (1924-1928), associate curator (1929-1933), curator in the newly formed Department of Renaissance and Modern Art (1934-1950) and its successor Department of Renaissance Art (1950-1957), and research curator there from 1957 to 1958. After Breck's death in 1933, the department was divided into the three separate departments, Medieval art (under James J. Rorimer), Renaissance and Post-Renaissance art (under Remington), and American Art (under Joseph Downs). He later advanced to the Vice-Directorship of the Department of Renaissance and Post-Renaissance Art. Remington chaired the Museum's Committee on Architectural Rearrangement from 1941 to 1943. Composed of Museum curators and administrators, the Committee was tasked with surveying individual departments' existing <b>storage,</b> <b>display,</b> and conservation spaces to assist in future planning for Museum expansion. In the 1950s, Remington worked on the installation of the period rooms of the Museum, opened in 1954. Throughout his career, he published extensively in his Museum's journals on objects in its collection.|$|E
