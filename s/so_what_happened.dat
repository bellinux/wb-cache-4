5000|$|Jones's {{influence}} in Black psychology {{came at a}} time when the Black Power Movement sought Black empowerment and recognition for the Black community. In mainstream psychology, studies often concluded that Black-White differences were due to deficiencies in Black people. In an interview, Jones explains the problem with this framework:Now, the research always has the middle-class black child compared to the lower-class white child. Nobody ever talked about the middle-class blacks or upper middle-class blacks. Everything was lower class, and that’s a problem of methodology. It’s a methodological flaw in the research because you need to have comparable social classes and comparable races to make a valid comparison. That was never done. <b>So,</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened,</b> since the government was pouring tens of millions of dollars into studying the black child in relationship to the middle-class white child—there were hundreds, probably thousands, of research studies—they all concluded that on whatever dimension was studied, practically, the black child was deficient in some way.

50|$|On Nightal 20 of the 1375 DR, Cavatina {{killed the}} demigod Selvetarm (with {{the help of}} the Lady Penitent), using the Crescent Blade that she had {{recovered}} almost intact.

However, Eilistraee emerged from the battle alive, suggesting that Vhaeraun had failed and perished at the hand of his sister. Chaos and despair spread among the followers of the Masked Lord, but some thought that their god was still alive, and that the twins had a plan and agreed to merge and work together against their mother for a time. Others were convinced that Vhaeraun succeeded and masked as Eilistraee. Either way, it was certain that after the event, Eilistraee was changed: she became a deity known as the Masked Lady, holding both the Dark Maiden's and the Masked Lord's portfolios and causing both their followers to cooperate, albeit uneasily.|$|E

In the 27 August issue of Billboard, Winwood's manager, Ron Weisner, said that Winwood granted Michelob use of the song to obtain tour sponsorship. In the 1 December issue of Rolling Stone, Weisner reiterated that the song was written before the deal with Michelob was struck. In a 1990 biography, Winwood explained: [...] "When album was finished, but before it came out, Michelob took the song they wanted, and very quickly shot the commercial. <b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> was the commercial came out before the album.
