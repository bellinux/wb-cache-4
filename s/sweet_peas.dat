25|$|The {{lathyrism}} {{resulting from}} the ingestion of Lathyrus odoratus seeds (<b>sweet</b> <b>peas)</b> {{is often referred to}} as odoratism or osteolathyrism, which is caused by a different toxin (beta-aminopropionitrile) that affects the linking of collagen, a protein of connective tissues.|$|E

50|$|In honour of Henry Eckford {{the town}} of Wem (specifically the Eckford <b>Sweet</b> <b>Pea</b> Society of Wem) holds each year in July a <b>sweet</b> <b>pea</b> show. In this there is a section for old {{fashioned}} varieties, always including many bred by Henry Eckford.|$|R
25|$|In {{clearing}} out the overgrowth, workers {{found that many}} of the original plants were growing where they had been planted – some more than 100 years ago. Numerous heirloom rose hybrids, including a Welsh rose (Bardou Job) that had been believed to be extinct, have been discovered and propagated. Many species of roses, succulents, and geraniums are growing among apple and fig trees, banks of <b>sweet</b> <b>peas,</b> manicured gardens of cutting flowers, and wildly overgrown sections of native grasses with blackberry and honeysuckle.|$|E
2500|$|In 1875, Galton started growing <b>sweet</b> <b>peas</b> and {{addressed}} the Royal Institution on his findings on 9 February 1877. [...] He found that {{each group of}} progeny seeds followed a normal curve, and the curves were equally disperse. Each group was not centered about the parent's weight, but rather at a weight closer to the population average. Galton called this reversion, as every progeny group was distributed at a value that was closer to the population average than the parent. The deviation from the population average {{was in the same}} direction, but the magnitude of the deviation was only one-third as large. In doing so, Galton demonstrated that there was variability among each of the families, yet the families combined to produce a stable, normally distributed population. When Galton addressed the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1885, he said of his investigation of <b>sweet</b> <b>peas,</b> [...] "I was then blind to what I now perceive to be the simple explanation of the phenomenon." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cuttyhunk {{is about}} {{a mile and a}} half long, and three-quarters of a mile wide, with a large natural harbor at the eastern end of the island. Fully half of the main part of the island is set apart as a nature preserve. [...] It is home to a wide variety of birds such as piping plovers, least terns and Massachusetts' American oystercatchers, as well as White-tailed deer, White-footed mice, and Eastern cottontails. It also has a small {{population}} of coyotes. Cuttyhunk has most varieties of New England’s wildflowers, as well as bayberry, <b>sweet</b> <b>peas,</b> and a host of other plant life.|$|E
5000|$|Embryo rescue {{techniques}} {{have been used}} to hybridize it with the <b>sweet</b> <b>pea.</b> This has resulted in new Lathyrus odoratus cultivars like the <b>Sweet</b> <b>Pea</b> [...] "Erewhon", and there is hope that {{it can be used to}} introduce the yellow color into Lathyrus odoratus.|$|R
25|$|Blue overhears Blondie {{relaying}} Babydoll's plan to Gorski, confirming {{his suspicions}} {{that something is}} amiss. He has <b>Sweet</b> <b>Pea</b> locked in a utility closet and confronts the other girls backstage. He shoots Amber and Blondie and attempts to rape Babydoll, but she stabs him with the kitchen knife and steals his master key. Babydoll frees <b>Sweet</b> <b>Pea</b> and starts a fire to keep the orderlies occupied while they look for an exit. They escape into the courtyard, where they find a throng of men blocking their way. Babydoll deduces that the fifth item needed for the escape is in fact her own sacrifice. She concludes that this is actually <b>Sweet</b> <b>Pea's</b> story. Despite <b>Sweet</b> <b>Pea's</b> protests, she insists on revealing herself to the visitors, thus distracting them long enough to allow her friend to slip away unnoticed.|$|R

2500|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the International Health Exhibition, Galton used these data to confirm in humans his theory of linear regression, posed after studying <b>sweet</b> <b>peas.</b> The accumulation of this human data allowed him to observe the correlation between forearm length and height, head width and head breadth, and head length and height. With these observations he was able to write “Co-relations and their Measurements, chiefly from Anthropometric Data". In this publication, Galton defined what co-relation as a phenomenon that occurs when [...] "the variation of the one [...] is accompanied on the average by more or less variation of the other, and in the same direction." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ricci has tattoos {{of a lion}} on {{her right}} {{shoulder}} blade (a reference to The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, a favorite novel of hers as a youngster), an Edward Gorey figure {{on the inside of}} her right wrist, a pair of praying hands on her left hip (this tattoo was originally a bat), the name [...] "Jack" [...] on her right thigh for a deceased pet, a sparrow on her right breast, and a mermaid on her left ankle. She also had the words [...] "Move or Bleed" [...] {{on the left side of}} her rib cage, as well as a bouquet of <b>sweet</b> <b>peas</b> on her lower back.|$|E
2500|$|Galton's {{development}} {{of the law of}} regression to the mean, or reversion, was due to insights from the quincunx and his studies of <b>sweet</b> <b>peas.</b> While Galton had previously invented the quincunx prior to February 1874, the 1877 version of the quincunx had a new feature that helped Galton demonstrate that a normal mixture of normal distributions is also normal. Galton demonstrated this using a new version of quincunx, adding chutes to the apparatus to represent reversion. When the pellets passed through the curved chutes (representing reversion) and then the pins (representing family variability), the result was a stable population. On Friday 19 February 1877 Galton gave a lecture entitled [...] "Typical Laws of Heredity" [...] at the Royal Institution in London. In this lecture, he posed that there must a counteracting force to maintain population stability. However, this model required a much larger degree of intergenerational natural selection than was plausible.|$|E

60|$|Rev. Elliott Sherwood had {{got back}} from his {{pastoral}} visitations, and was training his <b>sweet</b> <b>peas</b> {{in the way they}} should go against the garden fence.

Then {{he went back to his}} <b>sweet</b> <b>peas.</b> He had had his tea, he said, so that Frances did not see him again until she went home. She thought he was a very indifferent young man, and not half so nice as his sister.|$|E

60|$|He had her {{two hands}} imprisoned in his, {{the scent of}} <b>sweet</b> <b>peas</b> {{floating}} gently to his nostrils. As he buried his lips in their fragrant soft palms he was entirely happy. The world had floated away from him. He was in a land of magic with her; in a land where the air {{was filled with the}} fragrance of <b>sweet</b> <b>peas,</b> a land of phantasmagoria, the land of Fata Morgana, which none can enter save those who love. Time sped on, and both had forgotten the world. The fire crackled in the hearth, the clock alone recorded the passing of time. The noise of the great city--so cruel to those who suffer--came but as faint echo through the closely drawn curtains.|$|E
6000|$|The {{tenth of}} July that year was {{as the first}} day of summer. There had been much fine weather, but always easterly or northerly; now, after a broken, rainy fortnight, the sun had come in full summer warmth with a gentle breeze, {{drifting}} here and there scent of the opening lime blossom. In the garden, under the trees at the far end, Betty sewed at a garment, and the baby in her perambulator had her seventh morning sleep. Gyp stood before a bed of pansies and <b>sweet</b> <b>peas.</b> How monkeyish the pansies' faces! The <b>sweet</b> <b>peas,</b> too, were like tiny bright birds fastened to green perches swaying with the wind. And their little green tridents, growing out from the queer, flat stems, resembled the antennae of insects. Each of these bright frail, growing things had life and individuality like herself! ...|$|E
50|$|More recently, the {{association}} between the <b>sweet</b> <b>pea,</b> the Eckfords and Wem has been highlighted again. In the late 1980s, the <b>Sweet</b> <b>Pea</b> Society of Wem started an annual show. Many of the street signs now carry a sweet-pea motif, and {{an area of the}} town is known as Eckford Park. There is also a cultivar 'Dorothy Eckford', named after a family member.|$|R
50|$|Like {{the blue}} rose, the yellow <b>sweet</b> <b>pea</b> remains elusive. Lathyrus belinensis is a related Lathyrus species which has {{red and yellow}} flowers. There are ongoing {{attempts}} to bring the yellow color into Lathyrus odoratus by crossing it with Lathyrus belinensis. Several new <b>sweet</b> <b>pea</b> cultivars have been created as a result, though not any with the yellow flower color so far.|$|R
