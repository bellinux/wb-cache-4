40|$|Some of {{the most}} {{significant}} advances in the practice of medicine have been related to the realization that microorganisms cause disease. These bacteria have certain susceptibilities that allow the practitioner to prescribe appropriate antimicrobial therapy and, with remarkable reliability, participate in the resolution of disease-caused symptoms. Sophisticated microbiologic techniques used in research settings have allowed the characterization of pathogens and their antibiograms. This information has immediate clinical applicability in that recommendations for specific antibiotic therapy can be made. In fact, the information has been considered so helpful that most clinicians considering the diagnosis of infection would culture the appropriate <b>site,</b> <b>check</b> the culture results, and followup with the antibiogram to ensure that resistance is not a problem.

Smallpox Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) - This document, entitled "Smallpox Vaccine: What You Need to Know," contains information about smallpox disease, the benefits and risks of smallpox vaccine, contraindications, vaccination site care instructions, what to do if a reaction occurs after vaccination, and where to get more information. 3. Pre-Event Screening Worksheet for Smallpox Vaccine n 1 ̆ 92 a worksheet with questions to help individuals determine whether or not they should receive smallpox vaccine because of certain medical conditions that would place them at a greater risk for an adverse reaction from the vaccine. Some of these questions are of a personal and sensitive nature. Those implementing smallpox vaccination clinics should be prepared to discuss, but not collect, this sheet. 4. Someone You are Close to May Get Smallpox Vaccine: What You Should Know and Do - a fact sheet that informs close contacts of people considering vaccination about the health conditions that put people at risk if they are in close physical contact with someone who has been vaccinated.
