To evaluate the effects of <b>shared</b> <b>ownership</b> on virtual teams, two studies were performed.

25|$|Thomas Cant died in 1831. Changes in <b>share</b> <b>ownership</b> {{over the}} next few years gave control of the company to a new group of men. The {{principal}} shareholder was George Head Head, a Quaker banker from Carlisle, who owned 18 of the 64 shares by 1835. A new mine agent was appointed in 1832, and mining operations were greatly expanded, with 90 men being employed by 1834. A major investment was needed to access ore beneath the current level of the mine, but this meant driving a new level in barren ground for hundreds of yards. To safeguard their investment the company negotiated a fourteen-year extension to their lease (in 1835), giving them security until 1862.|$|E

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{problematic}} {{nature of the}} label ‘home ownership’ through {{a case study of}} the English model of <b>shared</b> <b>ownership,</b> one of the methods used by the UK government to make home ownership affordable. Adopting a legal and socio-legal analysis, the article considers whether <b>shared</b> <b>ownership</b> is capable of fulfilling the aspirations households have for home ownership. To do so, the article considers the financial and non-financial meanings attached to home ownership and suggests that the core expectation lies in ownership of the value. The article demonstrates that the rights and responsibilities of shared owners are different in many respects from those of traditional home owners, including their rights as regards ownership of the value. By examining home ownership through the lens of <b>shared</b> <b>ownership</b> the article draws out lessons of broader significance to housing studies. In particular, it is argued that <b>shared</b> <b>ownership</b> shows the limitations of two dichotomies commonly used in housing discourse: that between private and social housing; and the classification of tenure between owner-occupiers and renters. The article concludes that a much more nuanced way of referring to home ownership is required, {{and that there is a}} need for a change of expectations amongst consumers as to what <b>sharing</b> <b>ownership</b> means...|$|R

2500|$|Management must {{identify}} the [...] "optimal mix" [...] of financing – the capital structure {{that results in}} maximum firm value, (See Balance sheet, WACC) but must also take other factors into account (see trade-off theory below). Financing a project through debt results in a liability or obligation that must be serviced, thus entailing cash flow implications independent of the project's degree of success. Equity financing is less risky with respect to cash flow commitments, but results in a dilution of <b>share</b> <b>ownership,</b> control and earnings. The cost of equity (see CAPM and APT) is also typically higher {{than the cost of}} debt - which is, additionally, a deductible expense – and so equity financing may result in an increased hurdle rate which may offset any reduction in cash flow risk.|$|E

By 1900, Argentina (16,563 km), Brazil (15,316 km) and Mexico (13,615 km) were the leaders in length of track in service, and Peru, which had been an early leader in railway construction, had stagnated (1,790 km).

2500|$|Increasing {{attention}} and regulation (as under the Swiss referendum [...] "against corporate Rip-offs" [...] of 2013) {{has been brought}} to executive pay levels since the financial crisis of 2007–2008. Research {{on the relationship between}} firm performance and executive compensation does not identify consistent and significant relationships between executives' remuneration and firm performance. Not all firms experience the same levels of agency conflict, and external and internal monitoring devices may be more effective for some than for others. Some researchers have found that the largest CEO performance incentives came from ownership of the firm's shares, while other researchers found that the relationship between <b>share</b> <b>ownership</b> and firm performance was dependent on the level of ownership. The results suggest that increases in ownership above 20% cause management to become more entrenched, and less interested in the welfare of their shareholders.|$|E
