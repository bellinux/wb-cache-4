5|$|Bonaparte's {{position}} as First Consul was {{strengthened by the}} successful outcome of the battle and the preceding campaign. After this victory, Napoleon could breathe a sigh of relief. The generals who had been hostile to him could <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> luck had not abandoned him. Thus, he had surpassed Schérer, Joubert, Championnet, and even Moreau, none {{of whom had been}} able to inflict a decisive blow on the Coalition. Moreau's victory at Hohenlinden, which was the one that in reality had {{put an end to the}} war, was minimised by Bonaparte who, from then on, would pose as a saviour of the fatherland, and even of the Republic. He rejected offers from Louis XVIII, who had considered the Consulate to be a mere transition towards the restoration of the king. Thanks to the victory at Marengo, Napoleon could finally set about reforming France according to his own vision.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, he starred {{alongside}} Melissa Leo in Why Stop Now, a {{drama about}} a drug addict mother (Leo) and her piano prodigy son (Eisenberg), and in the magical realist romantic comedy To Rome with Love, directed by Woody Allen. That same year, he filed a $3million lawsuit against the producers of the 2010 direct-to-DVD film Camp Hell, claiming exploitation. According to the lawsuit, Eisenberg agreed {{to appear in the}} film as a favor to his friends. He was on set for one day of filming in 2007, earned about $3,000, and logged only a few minutes of total screentime. Because of his minimal involvement in the production, he was surprised to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> face was prominently featured {{on the cover of the}} DVD, implying that he starred in the film. His lawsuit asserts various California law causes of action, including claims for unfair business practices and publicity rights.|$|E
5|$|In the South Indian {{kingdom of}} Cholapuram Paalayam {{in the year}} 1771, Raja Mokkaiyappar and his queen, Rajamatha Bhavani Ammaiyar are desperate for a child, as all their {{previous}} twenty-two children have died at birth. Unknown to them, Bhavani's brother, Sangilimayan, {{who is also the}} Rajaguru (High priest), is {{responsible for the death of}} their children. Sangilimayan is shocked to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> sister has given birth to twins. Before informing the king about the birth, he calls the palace astrologer, Chinnavadayaan, who predicts that the elder twin will be incapable of making decisions on his own while the younger one will be smarter. Sangilimayan orders the palace doctor, Kailasakaruppan, to kill the younger one, but Chinnavadayaan tells Sangilimayan that his actions would not be good for the kingdom. Instead, Sangilimayan orders the palace doctor to abandon the child in a nearby river. The elder child is named Pulikecei XXIII. Maragathavalli, Kailasakaruppan's childless wife, rescues the abandoned child from the river, and the couple decides to raise him as their own, naming him Ukraputhan.|$|E

Henry was crowned emperor by his creature, but Robert Guiscard, with whom in the {{meantime}} Gregory had formed an alliance, was already marching on the city. Henry was compelled to flee towards Civita Castellana.|$|E
25|$|As Defense Minister, Lin's {{policies}} {{differed from}} those of his predecessor. Lin attempted to reform China's armed forces based on political criteria: he abolished all signs and privileges of rank, purged members considered sympathetic to the USSR, directed soldiers to work part-time as industrial and agricultural workers, and indoctrinated the armed forces in Mao Zedong Thought. Lin's system of indoctrination made it clear the Party was in command of China's armed forces, and Lin ensured that the army's political commissars enjoyed great power and status in order to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> directives were followed. Lin implemented these reforms in order to please Mao, but privately was concerned that they would weaken the PLA (which they did). Mao strongly approved of these reforms, and conscientiously promoted Lin {{to a series of}} high positions.|$|E

500|$|In his Harrison biography, Here Comes the Sun, Joshua Greene {{notes the}} effect that this time with Dylan and the Band had on Harrison, with regard to his growing dissatisfaction as a Beatle. [...] "Like Dylan, George was {{beginning}} to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> next step needed {{to be away from}} everything he had done up to that moment", Greene writes. [...] "Watching Dylan over Thanksgiving... showed George how happy someone could be following his own direction and making his own rules." [...] In his essay for Mojo magazine covering Harrison's 1970 solo release, All Things Must Pass, John Harris identifies this time in Woodstock as the beginning of Harrison's [...] "journey" [...] to making the album.|$|E
500|$|Tunis' next novel, Go Team Go, set in 1954, {{returns to}} Indiana basketball. Again a coach risks {{the support of}} fans by cutting players, {{including}} the team star. The hero, Tom Williams, comes to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> coach was right, and gets his father's respect – and the girl – by helping the new team move forward. Buddy and the Old Pro is a 1955 novel about Pop Warner football. Tunis disliked organized sports for young children, saying [...] "I've always believed Little League is harmful to the extreme. It's for the parents, and that's what I object to... I don't {{like the idea of}} having little boys playing in front of their parents and friends. Little boys should be playing their sports by themselves." [...] In what Michelle Nolan in Ball Tales calls a [...] "remarkable book", Tunis uses his only non-Dodgers baseball novel to emphasize a favorite theme when the young protagonist admits to his father [...] "it's better to lose, much as it hurts, than to play dirty".|$|E
500|$|Sleeper berth time is {{any amount}} of time spent inside the sleeper berth (e.g., resting or sleeping). FMCSA {{regulation}} §393.76 gives the minimum requirements for a space to be defined as a sleeper berth. The simple definition is an area separate from (usually immediately behind) the driving controls that includes a bed. The rules do not explicitly require that a driver must sleep, only that a driver must take a period of [...] "rest" [...] within the sleeper berth or off-duty (i.e., home). A statement made by the ICC in 1937 gives the reason: [...] "We have no control over the manner in which a driver may spend his time off-duty, although some of his spare time activities may tire him as much as any work would do. We can only emphasize, by this comment, the responsibility which is the driver's own to assure himself of adequate rest and sleep, in the time available for this purpose, to ensure safety of his driving, and likewise the employer's responsibility to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> drivers report for work in fit condition." ...|$|E

500|$|In September 1959 Mao {{replaced}} Peng as Defense Minister with Lin Biao, effectively ending Peng's military career. Peng was {{relocated to}} {{a suburb of}} Beijing, forfeiting his Marshal's uniform and military decorations. Lin reversed Peng's reforms, abolishing all signs and privileges of rank, purging officers considered sympathetic to the USSR, directing soldiers to work part-time as industrial and agricultural labourers, and indoctrinating the armed forces in Mao Zedong Thought. Lin's system of indoctrination {{made it clear that}} the Party was clearly in command of China's armed forces, and Lin ensured that the army's political commissars enjoyed great power and status in order to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> directives were followed. Lin implemented these reforms in order to please Mao, but privately was concerned that they would weaken the PLA. Lin used his position as Minister of Defense to flatter Mao by using the army to promote Mao's personality cult throughout China, devising and running a number of national Maoist propaganda campaigns based on the PLA. The most successful of Lin's efforts to promote Mao's personality cult was the [...] "learn from Lei Feng" [...] campaign, which Lin began in 1963.|$|E

2500|$|The final {{revelation of}} Snape's loyalty in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was viewed {{positively}} by fans and critics alike. Daniel Radcliffe, who portrays Harry Potter {{in the movie}} series, expressed his delight, saying he was pleased to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> theory that Snape would {{end up being a}} sort of tragic hero came through. Elizabeth Hand from The Washington Post wrote, [...] "The much-maligned loner Snape does not come onstage until the latter part of [...] "Deathly Hallows," [...] but when he does the book becomes his: Snape's fate, more than Voldemort's, perhaps more even than Harry's, is the most heartbreaking, surprising and satisfying of all of Rowling's achievements." ...|$|E
2500|$|Having read Westropp, Sir John knew {{perfectly}} well that all the former's Mesolithic implements were surface finds. He used his prestige to quell the concept of Mesolithic as best he could, but the public could <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> methods were not typological. The less prestigious scientists publishing in the smaller journals continued {{to look for a}} Mesolithic. For example, Isaac Taylor in The Origin of the Aryans, 1889, mentions the Mesolithic but briefly, asserting, however, that it formed [...] "a transition between the Palaeolithic and Neolithic Periods." [...] Nevertheless, Sir John fought on, opposing the Mesolithic by name as late as the 1897 edition of his work.|$|E

2500|$|On June 9, 1953, Hunt's 24-year-old son Lester Jr., {{known as}} [...] "Buddy", {{who was a}} student and {{president}} of the student body at the Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was arrested in Washington, D.C., for soliciting prostitution from a male undercover police officer in Lafayette Square, just north of and adjacent to the White House property. It was his first offense, which police normally handled quietly as a matter for the offender's family to address, but the arrest became known to Senate Republicans. [...] According to Drew Pearson's Washington Merry-Go-Round column published after Hunt's death, Senators Styles Bridges and Herman Welker threatened that if Hunt did not immediately retire from the Senate and agree not to seek his seat in the 1954 election, they would <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> son was prosecuted and would widely publicize his son's arrest.|$|E
2500|$|In 1845, it was {{alleged that}} paupers at the Andover Union workhouse {{employed}} in crushing bones were (regardless {{of age or}} state of decay) eating marrow from the bones and gnawing off any shreds of meat still adherent. [...] When reported to the guardians, they had neither intervened, nor informed the Poor Law Commissioners. [...] The Assistant Poor Law Commissioner for the area (a Mr Parker) was sent to investigate, and found the allegations to be largely true, if slightly over-stated. This {{had been going on}} for some time without being detected by the Poor Law Commission's supervisory regime (in the first instance Mr Parker). The Home Secretary had on a number of occasions told the House of Commons that grinding bone was work of too penal a nature to be carried out by workhouse inmates, and the Poor Law Commission would <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> wish that it should cease was acted upon. [...] The crushed bones were mostly sold to the guardians(for use as fertiliser) at a price which did not represent good value for the rate-payer.|$|E
2500|$|Since 1851 {{there has}} been a summit cross on the top of Zugspitze. The driving force behind the {{erection}} of a cross on the summit was the priest, Christoph Ott. He was a keen meteorologist and whilst observing conditions from the Hoher Peißenberg mountain he saw the Zugspitze in the distance and was exercised by the fact that [...] "the greatest prince of the Bavarian mountains raised its head into the blue air towards heaven, bare and unadorned, waiting for the moment when patriotic fervour and courageous determination would <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> head too was crowned with dignity." [...] As a result, he organised an expedition from 11 to 13 August 1851 with the goal of erecting a summit cross on the Zugspitze. Twenty eight bearers were led through the gorge of the Partnachklamm and the Reintal valley under the direction of forester, Karl Kiendl, up to the Zugspitze. The undertaking, which cost 610Gulden and 37Kreuzer, was a success. As a result, a 28-piece, 14foot high, gilded iron cross now stood on the West Summit. Ott himself did not climb the Zugspitze until 1854.|$|E
