5|$|Prokofiev {{had been}} {{considering}} making an opera out of Leo Tolstoy's epic novel War and Peace, when {{news of the}} German invasion of Russia on 22June 1941 made the subject <b>seem</b> <b>all</b> the more timely. Prokofiev took two years to compose his original version of War and Peace. Because of the war he was evacuated together {{with a large number}} of other artists, initially to the Caucasus where he composed his Second String Quartet. By now, his relationship with the 25-year-old writer and librettist Mira Mendelson (1915–1968) had finally led to his separation from his wife Lina, although they never divorced: indeed Prokofiev had tried to persuade Lina and their sons to accompany him as evacuees out of Moscow, but Lina opted to stay.|$|E

The disc received a favorable review from Schwegweb's Vin Cherubino, who noted, [...] "The music has just as much quality as any popular artist in the same genre. Influences from bands such as Tool can be heard, making the music <b>seem</b> <b>all</b> so familiar and palatable." ...|$|E

500|$|Lichtenstein's {{technique}} {{has been characterized}} by Ernst A. Busche as [...] "the enlargement and unification of his source material... {{on the basis of}} strict artistic principles". Extracted from a larger narrative, the resulting stylized image became in some cases a [...] "virtual abstraction". By recreating their minimalistic graphic techniques, Lichtenstein reinforced the artificial nature of comic strips and advertisements. Lichtenstein's magnification of his source material made his impersonally drawn motifs <b>seem</b> <b>all</b> the more empty. Busche also says that although a critique of modern industrial America may be read into these images, Lichtenstein [...] "would appear to accept the environment as revealed by his reference material as part of American capitalist industrial culture".|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Paige made {{a return}} to the West End stage {{for the first time in}} six years, as the Chaperone/Beatrice Stockwell in The Drowsy Chaperone at the Novello Theatre. The {{production}} ran for a disappointing 96 performances, although it had opened to a standing ovation from the audience and a generally optimistic reaction from critics. The Daily Telegraph wrote, [...] "Elaine Paige is a good sport... enduring jokes about her reputation for being 'difficult' with a grin that doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>all</b> that forced.... Only the self-importantly serious and the chronically depressed will fail to enjoy this preposterously entertaining evening". Paul Taylor from The Independent was less impressed and wrote [...] "a miscast Elaine Paige manages to be unfunny to an almost ingenious degree as the heroine's bibulous minder". For her performance, Paige was nominated for a What's On Stage Award in the category of Best Supporting Actress in a Musical. She next collaborated with the duo Secret Garden in recording the song [...] "The Things You Are to Me" [...] for their 2007 album, Inside I'm Singing.|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{performed}} [...] "Teeth" [...] during The Monster Ball Tour. The Riverfront Times {{said her}} January 2010 {{performance of the}} song in St. Louis was [...] "fantastic" [...] and described it as [...] "a fierce Broadway strut full of vamps, vigor and choreographed dancing which recalled Chicago". Gaga performed an [...] "angry version" [...] of the song at Radio City Music Hall a few days later; she [...] "hunched over in an animalistic crouch, surrounded by a predatory-looking pack of dancers" [...] while images of a [...] "ferocious" [...] wolf were displayed. She grabbed her crotch and [...] "snarled" [...] to emphasize the song's lyrics; Dan Aquilante of the New York Post said these actions [...] "didn’t <b>seem</b> <b>all</b> that inappropriate". Gaga performed a [...] "concert version" [...] of the song at Lollapalooza in August 2010, during which a guitar solo was played between each iteration of the line, [...] "Show me your teeth!" [...] During some performances of the song, she told concert attendees she never lip syncs. In his review of Gaga's April 2011 performance in Montreal, Mike Lepage said the reminder was [...] "needless" [...] and wrote, [...] "What idiot would actually have charged this canary-haired dynamo with that? If anything, you can’t shut the Gaga up, and she has both the chops and the pride to deliver it all live." [...] She also performed the song in her setlist for the 2017 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.|$|E

500|$|Several {{publications}} for manga, anime, video games, {{and other}} related media have provided praise and criticism on Kakashi's character. Christopher A. Born regards Kakashi's teaching of Team 7 {{to work as a}} team, even if they have to break the rules, to be reinforcing the Confucian values of the [...] "importance of benevolence and reciprocity". IGN noted the duality of Kakashi's serious persona in combat and his laid back, apathetic countenance when dealing with his students, but accepted that {{he is one of the}} most popular characters in the series. They also commented that Kakashi is one of the more popular characters they have seen cosplayed at anime conventions. Active Anime celebrated Kakashi's abilities, noting that he fell into the overall theme of characters hiding detailed personalities and secrets. T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews derided Kakashi as a stereotypical [...] "Man of Mystery" [...] seen in other shōnen manga, but praised him as being [...] "much more interesting" [...] than the three main characters, and felt that for all intents and purposes, the show could be renamed simply [...] "Kakashi". Mania Entertainment's Dani Moure likes how Kakashi fits into Team 7 because he is a [...] "hilarious character in that sometimes he doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>all</b> that bothered about things and yet is so masterful of his craft." [...] Chris Beveridge from the site stated that Kakashi is his favorite character from the series because of his personality and praised his fight against Pain, and that after its ending, the character gets [...] "a very humanizing moment", making the episode from the battle stand out. Manga author Yoshihiro Togashi found Kakashi's first battle against his students as one of the first series' moments that impressed him due to how the difference in strength between such characters was shown by just making Kakashi read a book during the fight. IGN ranked him as the 15th greatest anime character of all time, saying that [...] "He's a complex character, with an iconic character design and a laid back attitude that just exudes cool." [...] Amy McNulty from Anime News Network highly praised Kakashi's fight against Obito Uchiha due to its animation and the references to the two fighters' childhoods. In 2014, IGN listed him as the best Naruto character when the series ended.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the {{criminal}} trial, the media reported that Cabey had been shot on the fourth shot and then again on the fifth shot, with Goetz saying, [...] "You don't look too bad, here's another," [...] or, [...] "You <b>seem</b> <b>all</b> right, here's another." [...] This sequence of shots was discredited at {{the criminal}} trial when {{it was revealed that}} Cabey was shot once in the left side; however, some media still reported this sequence long after the criminal trial.|$|E

2500|$|A new-look West Indies A {{were close}} to giving Sri Lanka A a fight, but Sri Lanka A still won the match and the [...] "Test" [...] series. Daren Ganga made 109 for West Indies A, lifting them to 324 in total, before Dwayne Washington took three for 31 as Sri Lanka A were all out, twelve runs behind. However, the match {{was running out of}} time, and West Indies A did not <b>seem</b> <b>all</b> that keen on trying to win it. After wicket-keeper Lendl Simmons {{departed}} for 52, a total of 104 runs were hit in 55 overs – Darren Sammy making 40 not out off 166 balls. Yet, a marathon bowling effort from left-arm spinner Sajeewa Weerakoon yielded six wickets for 57 runs, and West Indies A were all out for 205 – setting a target of 218 with around 40 overs remaining. Sri Lanka A went for it positively, hitting at nearly exactly a run a ball, with Avishka Gunawardene top scoring with 49. Despite three quick wickets from Sammy to reduce Sri Lanka A to 186 for 6, that was as close as the Caribbean tourists got, as Dilhara Lokuhettige made 22 not out and guided the hosts to the target.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, in {{response}} to homiletic and practical needs, there appeared, previous to the tenth century, a number of collections of moral sentences and paraenetic fragments, partly from Scripture and partly from the more famous ecclesiastical writers; sometimes one writer (e.g. Gregory of Nazianzus, Basil the Great, especially John Chrysostom whom all the catenae-makers pillage freely) furnishes the material. Such collections are not so numerous as the Scriptural or even the dogmatic catenae. They <b>seem</b> <b>all</b> to depend on an ancient Christian [...] "Florilegium" [...] of the sixth century, that treated, in three books, of God, Man, the Virtues and Vices, and was known as τα ιερά (Sacred Things). Before long its material was recast in strict alphabetical order; took the name of τα ιερά parállela, [...] "Sacra Parallela" [...] (because in the third book a virtue and a vice had been regularly opposed to one another); and was attributed widely to John Damascene, whose authority was defended (against Loofs, Wendland, and Cohn) by K. Holl in the above-mentioned [...] "Fragmente vornikänischer Kirchenväter" [...] (Leipzig, 1899), though the Damascene probably based {{his work on the}} [...] "Capita theologica" [...] of Maximus Confessor. The text of these ancient compilations is often in a dubious state, and the authors of most of them are unknown; one of the principal difficulties in their use is the uncertainty concerning the correctness of the names to which the excerpts are attributed. The carelessness of copyists, the use of [...] "sigla", contractions for proper names, and the frequency of transcription, led naturally to much confusion.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, Burke did not {{condemn the}} French Revolution. In {{a letter of}} 9 August 1789, he wrote: [...] "England gazing with astonishment at a French {{struggle}} for Liberty and not knowing whether to blame or to applaud! The thing indeed, though I thought I saw something like it in progress for several years, has still something in it paradoxical and Mysterious. The spirit it is impossible not to admire; but the old Parisian ferocity has broken out in a shocking manner". The events of 5–6 October 1789, when a crowd of Parisian women marched on Versailles to compel King Louis XVI to return to Paris, turned Burke against it. In {{a letter to his}} son, Richard Burke, dated 10 October he said: [...] "This day I heard from Laurence who has sent me papers confirming the portentous state of France—where the Elements which compose Human Society <b>seem</b> <b>all</b> to be dissolved, and a world of Monsters to be produced in the place of it—where Mirabeau presides as the Grand Anarch; and the late Grand Monarch makes a figure as ridiculous as pitiable". On 4 November Charles-Jean-François Depont wrote to Burke, requesting that he endorse the Revolution. Burke replied that any critical language of it by him should be taken [...] "as no more than the expression of doubt" [...] but he added: [...] "You may have subverted Monarchy, but not recover'd freedom". In the same month he described France as [...] "a country undone". Burke's first public condemnation of the Revolution occurred on the debate in Parliament on the army estimates on 9 February 1790, provoked by praise of the Revolution by Pitt and Fox: ...|$|E
