40|$|Hypersonic {{vehicles}} and propulsion systems pose an extraordinary challenge for structures and materials. Airframes and engines require lightweight, high-temperature materials and structural configurations that can withstand the extreme environment of hypersonic flight. Some {{of the challenges}} posed include very high temperatures, heating of the whole vehicle, steady-state and transient localized heating from shock waves, high aerodynamic loads, high fluctuating pressure loads, potential for severe flutter, vibration, and acoustic loads and erosion. Correspondingly high temperature seals are required to meet these aggressive requirements. This presentation reviews relevant seal technology for both heritage (e. g. Space Shuttle, X- 15, and X- 38) {{vehicles and}} presents several <b>seal</b> <b>case</b> studies aimed at providing lessons learned for future hypersonic vehicle seal development. This presentation also reviews seal technology developed for the National Aerospace Plane propulsion systems and presents several <b>seal</b> <b>case</b> studies aimed at providing lessons learned for future hypersonic propulsion seal development...|$|E

40|$|Relative {{humidity}} {{has been}} recognized as an important environmental factor in many head-tape interface phenomena such as headwear, friction, staining, and tape shed. Accordingly, the relative humidity is usually specified in many applications of tape use, especially when tape recorders are enclosed in hermetically <b>sealed</b> <b>cases.</b> Normally, the relative humidity is believed regulated by humidification of the fill gas to the specification relative humidity. This study demonstrates that the internal relative humidity in a <b>sealed</b> <b>case</b> is completely controlled by the time-dpendence of the hygroscopic properties of the pack of magnetic recording tape. Differences {{are found in the}} hygroscopic properties of the same brand of tape, which apparently result from aging, and which may {{have an effect on the}} long-term humidity-regulating behavior in a <b>sealed</b> <b>case,</b> and on the occurrence of head-tape interface phenomena from the long-term use of the tape.

30|$|A {{high-performance}} dispersing homogenizer instrument (Ultra-Turrax T 50 Basic) {{equipped with}} a variable-speed drive with six different speeds (500 – 10, 000  rpm) was used to prepare the polymer gels and emulsified gels. The droplet size measurement was performed using a Leica DM 2000 microscope and a FRITSCH laser particle-size analyzer (LPSA) to investigate the effect of droplet size on emulsion stability. The LPSA measurement range is 0.01 – 600  µm. GL- 18 high-temperature disposable soda-lime-glass test tubes (18 [*]×[*] 180  mm) with an approximate volume of 32  mL and an operating temperature of 180  °C were used. The high-temperature tubes were sealed with a screw-cap and a rubber <b>seal</b> <b>case</b> to prevent evaporation. The lack of evaporation was confirmed by comparing the initial and final volumes of each sample {{at the end of}} the experiment. A laboratory oven (Fisher Isotemp 350 G series 300, temperature range: ambient to 300  °C) was used to study the emulsion separation—specifically, the separated volume fraction of the phases versus time. A high-pressure cell mounted on the rheometer was used to perform all of the dynamic oscillatory measurements in the temperature range from 120 to 150  °C (248 – 302  °F) and at a pressure of 34.47  bar (500 psi), which is much higher than the water vapor pressure at 150  °C (~[*] 70 psi). Hence, water was in the liquid phase. Pressure was not expected to affect the gels’ strength since the role of pressure was to keep the liquid in solution; the strain used was within the linear viscoelastic range. The dynamic measurements were conducted at a fixed strain of 10 % and a frequency of 1  Hz (Hz); these conditions have been previously demonstrated to be within the linear viscoelastic range for PAM/PEI (El-Karsani et al. 2015 a, b).|$|E

40|$|Animal {{movement}} research {{relies on}} biotelemetry, and telemetry-based locations are increasingly augmented with ancillary information. This presents an underutilized opportunity to enhance movement process models. Given tags designed to record specific behaviors, efforts are increasing to update movement models beyond reliance solely upon horizontal movement information to improve inference of space use and activity budgets. We present two state-space models adapted to incorporate ancillary data to inform three discrete movement states: directed, resident, and an activity state. These were developed for two case studies: (1) a “haulout” model for Weddell seals, and (2) an “activity” model for Antarctic fur seals which intersperse periods of diving activity and inactivity. The methodology is easily implementable with any ancillary data {{that can be}} expressed as a proportion (or binary) indicator. A comparison of the models augmented with ancillary information and unaugmented models confirmed that many behavioral states appeared mischaracterized in the latter. Important changes in subsequent activity budgets occurred. Haulout accounted for 0. 17 of the overall Weddell seal time budget, with the estimated proportion {{of time spent in}} a resident state reduced from a posterior median of 0. 69 (0. 65 – 0. 73; 95 % HPDI) to 0. 54 (0. 50 – 0. 58 HPDI). The drop was more dramatic in the Antarctic fur <b>seal</b> <b>case,</b> from 0. 57 (0. 52 – 0. 63 HPDI) to 0. 22 (0. 20 – 0. 25 HPDI), with 0. 35 (0. 31 – 0. 39 HPDI) of time spent in the inactive (nondiving) state. These findings reinforce previously raised contentions about the drawbacks of behavioral states inferred solely from horizontal movements. Our findings have implications for assessing habitat requirements; estimating energetics and consumption; and management efforts such as mitigating fisheries interactions. Combining multiple sources of information within integrated frameworks should improve inference of relationships between movement decisions and fitness, the interplay between resource and habitat dependencies, and their changes at the population and landscape level. 13 page(s...|$|E
40|$|A time-linearized CFD solver for {{analyzing}} rotordynamics of gas seals is presented offering {{an improvement over}} existing linearized CFD solvers. Previous linearized solvers required structured grids and axisymmetric domains, limiting {{the complexity of the}} geometries of the seals that could be analyzed. A preexisting, full-order, in-house CFD solver was available which operated on fully 3 D and unstructured grids and was well suited for complex seal geometries. A linearized version of the in-house code is developed as a companion to the full-order solver, retaining its unstructured and fully 3 D features. Furthermore, boundary conditions are developed for the linearized solver allowing it {{to take advantage of the}} geometric symmetries that were required by earlier linearized solvers without necessarily being limited to them. Additionally, a linearization procedure is presented which is general enough to be used for the many various features of the full-order solver. As the in-house code continues to be developed and new features are included, the same linearization procedure can be used to keep the companion code up to date. The full-order, in-house solver and the time-linearized companion code combine to become a powerful CFD-perturbation solver accessible to all complexities of seal geometries. This dissertation also presents an analytical formula that describes features of cavity flow as it pertains to annular gas seals in order to progress the fundamental understanding of the flow physics of roughened seals. An existing semi-empirical analytical formula, developed to describe the cavity flow of aircraft bomb bays, is modified using the full-order, in-house CFD solver. The numeric model is validated against experimental measurements and used to adjust empirical parameters of the formula to match cavity flow conditions unique to annular seals. The modified analytical formula is able to predict features of cavity flows found in annular gas seals better than existing formulae. Finally, the companion, time-linearized CFD solver is verified using two simple cases and the combined full-order and time-linearized CFD-perturbation solver is used to predict rotordynamic properties for two gas seal geometries. The first case used to verify the linearized solver is a channel flow with an oscillating back-pressure and the second is a stationary flow with an oscillating wall. The first gas <b>seal</b> <b>case</b> the combined CFD-perturbation solver is used for is a straight seal based on the High Pressure Oxidizer Turbopump (HPOTP) of the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME). The second is a stepped labyrinth seal. The rotordynamic predictions are compared with established bulk-flow models of the two cases and conclusions are presented...|$|E

5000|$|In a 2002 opinion {{entitled}} In re: <b>Sealed</b> <b>Case</b> No. 02-001, the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review examined all {{the significant}} appellate decisions.

Furthermore, if there was such power, [...] "FISA could not encroach on the president's constitutional power", However, In Re <b>Sealed</b> <b>Case</b> [...] "took for granted" [...] that these cases are correct: The Truong court, as did all the other courts to have decided the issue, held that the President did have inherent authority to conduct warrantless searches to obtain foreign intelligence information. It was incumbent upon the court, therefore, to determine the boundaries of that constitutional authority in the case before it. We take for granted that the President does have that authority and, assuming that is so, FISA could not encroach on the President's constitutional power ...... Even without taking into account the President's inherent constitutional authority to conduct warrantless foreign intelligence surveillance, we think the procedures and government showings required under FISA, if they do not meet the minimum Fourth Amendment warrant standards, certainly come close. We, therefore, believe firmly, applying the balancing test drawn from Keith, that FISA as amended is constitutional because the surveillances it authorizes are reasonable.|$|R
