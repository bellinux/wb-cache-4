60|$|This was {{the true}} explanation; one that did not occur to the less {{experienced}} sealers. It is a danger, however, of no rare occurrence in the ice, and one that ever needs to be looked to. The bergs, when they first break loose from their native moorings, which {{is done by the}} agency of frosts, {{as well as by the}} action of the seasons in the warm months, are usually tabular, and of regular outlines; but this shape is soon lost by the action of the waves on ice of very different degrees of consistency; some being composed of frozen snow; some of the moisture precipitated from the atmosphere in the shape of fogs; and some of pure frozen water. The first melts soonest; and a berg that drifts for any length of time with one particular face exposed to the sun's rays, soon loses its equilibrium, and is canted with an inclination to the horizon. Finally, the centre of gravity gets outside of the base, when the still monstrous mass rolls over in the ocean, coming literally bottom upwards. There are all degrees and varieties of these ice-slips, if one may so term them, and they bring in their train the many different commotions that such accidents would naturally produce. That which had just alarmed and astonished our navigators was of the following character. A mass of ice that was about a quarter of a mile in length, and of fully half that breadth, which floated quite two hundred feet above the surface of the water, and twice that thickness beneath it, was the cause of the disturbance. It had preserved its outlines unusually well, and stood upright to the last moment; though, owing to numerous strata of <b>snow-ice,</b> its base had melted much more on one of its sides than on the other. When the precise moment arrived that would have carried a perpendicular line from the centre of gravity without this base, the monster turned leisurely in its lair, producing some such effect as would have been wrought by the falling of a portion of a Swiss mountain into a lake; a sort of accident of which there have been many and remarkable instances.|$|E
6000|$|The {{opening of}} large tracts by the ice-cutters {{commonly}} causes a pond {{to break up}} earlier; for the water, agitated by the wind, even in cold weather, wears away the surrounding ice. But such was not the effect on Walden that year, for she had soon got a thick new garment {{to take the place}} of the old. This pond never breaks up so soon as the others in this neighborhood, on account both of its greater depth and its having no stream passing through it to melt or wear away the ice. I never knew it to open in the course of a winter, not excepting that of '52-3, which gave the ponds so severe a trial. It commonly opens about the first of April, a week or ten days later than Flint's Pond and Fair Haven, beginning to melt on the north side and in the shallower parts where it began to freeze. It indicates better than any water hereabouts the absolute progress of the season, being least affected by transient changes of temperature. A severe cold of a few days' duration in March may very much retard the opening of the former ponds, while the temperature of Walden increases almost uninterruptedly. A thermometer thrust into the middle of Walden on the 6th of March, 1847, stood at 32º, or freezing point; near the shore at 33º; in the middle of Flint's Pond, the same day, at 32º; at a dozen rods from the shore, in shallow water, under ice a foot thick, at 36º. This difference of three and a half degrees between the temperature of the deep water and the shallow in the latter pond, and the fact that a great proportion of it is comparatively shallow, show why it should break up so much sooner than Walden. The ice in the shallowest part was at this time several inches thinner than in the middle. In midwinter the middle had been the warmest and the ice thinnest there. So, also, every one who has waded about the shores of the pond in summer must have perceived how much warmer the water is close to the shore, where only three or four inches deep, than a little distance out, and on the surface where it is deep, than near the bottom. In spring the sun not only exerts an influence through the increased temperature of the air and earth, but its heat passes through ice a foot or more thick, and is reflected from the bottom in shallow water, and so also warms the water and melts the under side of the ice, at the same time that it is melting it more directly above, making it uneven, and causing the air bubbles which it contains to extend themselves upward and downward until it is completely honeycombed, and at last disappears suddenly in a single spring rain. Ice has its grain as well as wood, and when a cake begins to rot or [...] "comb," [...] that is, assume the appearance of honeycomb, whatever may be its position, the air cells are at right angles with what was the water surface. Where there is a rock or a log rising near to the surface the ice over it is much thinner, and is frequently quite dissolved by this reflected heat; and I have been told that in the experiment at Cambridge to freeze water in a shallow wooden pond, though the cold air circulated underneath, and so had access to both sides, the reflection of the sun from the bottom more than counterbalanced this advantage. When a warm rain in the middle of the winter melts off the <b>snow-ice</b> from Walden, and leaves a hard dark or transparent ice on the middle, there will be a strip of rotten though thicker white ice, a rod or more wide, about the shores, created by this reflected heat. Also, as I have said, the bubbles themselves within the ice operate as burning-glasses to melt the ice beneath.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This thesis {{examines}} {{global warming}} and the possible contribution that ozone depletion provides to this warming. An examination is performed {{to determine the extent}} of any warming/cooling events within the Earth-atmosphere system. The change in energy corresponding to this warning of the Earth- atmosphere system is estimated as being equivilent to an increase of mean solar input of 0. 22 W/m 2. This is compared to the predicted changes of solar input for the two most common global warming scenarios: greenhouse gases and solar irradiance variance; and for a less well explored scenario, <b>snow-ice</b> albedo change. Examination of ozone depletion data shows that an absence of ozone in the stratosphere produces an increase in UV-B radiation at the surface of the Earth. This increase in UV-B light has not previously been thourougly examined in any of the global warming scenarios. This is presented as a fourth scenario for global warming. An analytical three layer model of the Earth-atmosphere, based on an earlier two layer model, is developed. Using this model it is determined that greenhouse gases, solar irradiance, <b>snow-ice</b> albedo feedback and ozone depletion can cause warming of the Earth's atmosphere. After comparison with other models, a <b>snow-ice</b> albedo mechanism is incorporated into the three layer model. This produces an amplification effect of any warming that occurs. Compared to the observed increase of surface temperature between 1975 - 2000 of 0. 55 K, the model using a <b>snow-ice</b> albedo feedback, produced an increase of temperature of 1. 4 K for greenhouse gases, 0. 294 K for a solar irradiance increase and 0. 119 K caused by a decrease in the ozone layer. Of the greenhouse gas, solar irradiance and ozone depletion scenarios, ozone depletion demonstrates the most realistic relative changes with a cooling of the stratosphere and a warming of the troposphere and Earth's surface as has been observed. It is concluded that ozone depletion is likely for a reasonable part of observed global warming...|$|E

In winter 2002 / 03 and 2003 / 04, {{thermistors}} {{were installed}} in the ice on two shallow ponds in central Alaska {{in order to obtain}} data on ice temperatures and their response to increasing and decreasing air temperatures, and flooding and <b>snow-ice</b> formation. Snow depth and density, and ice thickness were also measured in order to understand how they affected and were affected by ice temperature variability. The lowest ice temperature (– 15. 58 C) and steepest temperature gradient (– 39. 88 Cm– 1) occurred during a 9 week period in autumn when there was no snow on the ice. With snow on the ice, temperature gradients were more typically in the range – 20 to – 58 Cm– 1. Average ice temperatures were lower during the warmer, first winter, and higher during the cooler, second winter because of differences in the depth and duration of the snow cover. Isothermal ice near the freezing point resulted from flooding and <b>snow-ice</b> formation, and brief episodes of warm weather with freezing rain.

40|$|During the spring, when ozone {{depletion}} at the polar regions {{is at its}} maximum and consequently the environmental UV exposure is potentially high, many terrestrial communities are covered in snow and heterogeneous snow-encrusted ice that form near the edges of snowpack. Using field measurements and a theoretical radiative transfer model, we calculated the thicknesses of these covers {{that are necessary to}} reduce DNA-weighted dose to levels equal to or lower than those received later in the season in the absence of covers when there is no {{ozone depletion}}. This depth is approximately 4 cm for a 60 % depletion of the ozone column, suggesting that even thin <b>snow-ice</b> covers are enough to completely cancel the biological effects of ozone depletion. Loss of <b>snow-ice</b> covers during early summer can be rapid.

Climate warming might increase UV-radiation damage by melting UV-protecting terrestrial <b>snow-ice</b> covers earlier in the season, when ozone depletion is more severe. Conversely, climate cooling could increase UV-protection afforded to terrestrial communities by increasing the extent of snow and ice covers.

Sea ice was categorized into three types: <b>snow-ice,</b> granular ice and columnar ice, based on the oxygen isotopic ratio and ice texture. A higher nitrate + nitrite concentration up to 13. 5 μmol L – 1 {{was found in the}} snow and <b>snow-ice,</b> implying the deposition from the atmosphere, occurring as snowfall. Phosphate and silicic acid concentrations up to 14. 3 μmol L – 1 and 32. 7 μmol L – 1, respectively, were highest in granular ice. These results indicate the incorporation of organisms and/or sediment from under-ice water and subsequent remineralization reactions in sea ice...|$|E
40|$|Sea {{ice cover}} in the Arctic Ocean is a {{continued}} focus of attention. This study investigates {{the impact of the}} snow overlying the sea ice in the Arctic Ocean. The impact of snow depth biases in the Community Climate System Model (CCSM) is shown to impact not only the sea ice, but also the overall Arctic climate. Following the identification of seasonal biases produced in CCSM simulations, the thermodynamic transfer through the <b>snow–ice</b> column is perturbed to determine model sensitivity to these biases. This study concludes that perturbations on the order of the observed biases result in modification of the annual mean conductive flux through the <b>snow–ice</b> column of 0. 5 W m 2 relative to an unmodified simulation. The results suggest that the ice has a complex response to snow characteristics, with ice of different thicknesses producing distinct reactions. Our results indicate the importance of an accurate simulation of snow on the Arctic sea ice. Consequently, future work investigating the impact of current precipitation biases and missing snow processes, such as blowing snow, densification, and seasonal changes, is warranted...|$|E
40|$|Various {{physical}} properties {{of snow and}} sea ice were measured during ice stations in the Western Weddell Sea, Antarctic, during the POLARSTERN cruise ANT-XXIII/ 7 (WWOS) in 2006. Most stations were reached via a gangway directly from the vessels others by helicopter. All vertical positions are corrected to freeboard, e. g. z= 0 represents the <b>snow-ice</b> interface. More detailed information about the data sets and methods {{are available from the}} cruise report (section 4 sea-ice physics) ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. During two cruises in 1998 and 1999, we {{examined}} drift and ridging characteristics of sea {{ice in the}} Ross Sea, Antarctica. Mean ice thickness in the western Ross Sea in autumn was 0. 5 m, while higher level-ice thicknesses, greater areal coverages of ridges and higher sails {{were found in the}} central and eastern Ross Sea in summer. Near the continent, ice drifted westward near the coast and turned eastward further north. We use a regional sea-ice^mixed-layer^pycnocline model to initiate backward trajectories at the time and location of field observations and examine the dynamic and thermodynamic processes that determine ice thickness along these trajectories. Model results agree with previously published field data to indicate that thermodynamic and dynamic thickening and <b>snow-ice</b> formation each contribute significantly to the ice mass of the summer ice field in the central and eastern Ross Sea. For first-year ice in the western Ross Sea, model results and field data both indicate that thermodynamic thickening is the dominant pro-cess that determines ice thickness, with dynamic thickening also contributing 20 % to the net ice-thickening rate. However, model results fail to reproduce the prevalence of <b>snow-ice</b> formation that was seen in field data. 1...|$|E
40|$|A daytime {{over land}} {{multispectral}} cloud detection algorithm {{is presented to}} derive accurate convective cloud climatologies with high spatial resolution (1. 1 km) over the Iberian Peninsula (IP) and the Balearic Islands (BI). The cloud detection scheme was designed to process Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) HRPT data and is tested here on NOAA- 17 morning (0900 - 1200 UTC) and NOAA- 16 afternoon (1200 - 1500 UTC) overpasses for the warm 6 -month study period May-October. The algorithm consists of four spectral threshold tests applied to each pixel. Test 1 corresponds to the <b>snow-ice</b> removal, test 2 is the thermal infrared test, test 3 is the albedo or visible test and test 4 is the ratio between near-infrared and visible channels. The algorithm discretizes all AVHRR data into four groups called cloud-filled, cloud-free, <b>snow-ice</b> and snow-free radiances. The high-resolution convective cloud masks are obtained by subtracting <b>snow-ice</b> pixels from cloudy ones. In this article, {{a detailed description of}} the convective cloud detection scheme and the sources of error detected for each test are given, and the first seasonal and monthly regional convective cloud frequency composites are presented. Future applications of the newly proposed threshold algorithm in climate and meteorology are also discussed in this article, particularly the production of convective cloud composites for climate monitoring of storms over the IP and BI. © 2012 Royal Meteorological Society.
