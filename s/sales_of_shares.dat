50|$|In {{the sphere}} of the media, the {{government}} pursued the collaboration of the State with the CLT, {{at the same time}} reinforcing the control of the public powers over the company. On 4 April 1973, Pierre Werner signed an agreement to prolong the concessions to the CLT until 31 December 1995.

The ClT's remit also obliged it to maintain a symphonic orchestra.|$|E
50|$|The {{concession}} {{was granted}} on 2 February 1891 {{and had a}} duration of 40 years from the date the line started operation.

The largest owners were Gade (20%), Mowinckel (10%), Os Municipality (5%) and Krüger (2%).

50|$|During {{the rule}} of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), Croatia {{initiated}} its privatization program in 1992 when companies began arranging <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> to their employees. Privatization revenues and two thirds of unsold shares were then transferred to the Development Fund, while the remainder of unsold shares was transferred to the Pension Fund and the Disability Insurance Fund, both controlled by the state. Privatization often involved appointing new managers close to HDZ, or even the party's leading members, a trend which discouraged foreign investors. The state also took full ownership of over 100 important large companies and appointed new managers there, who were also often members of the ruling party.|$|E

5000|$|Baron Ferdinand Baeyens, {{governor}} on the Société Générale, was {{administrator of}} the BUP from 1904 {{until his retirement in}} October 1913, when Jean Jadot assumed both positions. The bank grew rapidly and profitably in the years following its foundation, with successive expansions of its capital base. It survived a financial crisis in 1907 and an economic crisis in 1913, a year in which its capital was raised to 80 million francs. [...] The Banque de l'Union Parisienne invested {{in a wide range of}} enterprises in France. It helped with the launch and expansion of Messageries Maritimes (shipping), Ericsson (telephones), De Dion-Bouton (cars), and so on. The BUP would lend capital as required for growth, recovering it through <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> when the market was strong.

The bank became closely involved with the industrial giant Schneider, helping financing in Russia, Morocco, and other countries. Some of the Schneider enterprises ran into difficulties, and from 1927 relations with the bank were strained, with a final break in 1929.|$|E
