50|$|In analog <b>strip</b> <b>chart</b> {{recorders}} such {{as used in}} electrocardiographs, electroencephalographs and polygraphs, galvanometer mechanisms {{were used}} to position the pen. <b>Strip</b> <b>chart</b> recorders with galvanometer driven pens may have a full scale frequency response of 100 Hz and several centimeters of deflection.|$|E
50|$|Chart {{recorders}} {{are built}} in three primary formats. <b>Strip</b> <b>chart</b> recorders {{have a long}} strip of paper that is ejected out of the recorder. Circular chart recorders have a rotating disc of paper that must be replaced more often, but are more compact and amenable to being enclosed behind glass. Roll chart recorders are similar to <b>strip</b> <b>chart</b> recorders except that the recorded data is stored on a round roll, and the unit is usually fully enclosed.|$|E

50|$|SPURV {{was first}} {{operated}} from the ATA-195, the Navy Seagoing Tug Tatnuck in a 1957 cruise to Cobb Seamount. A tracking system {{had been built}} for the Tatnuck by Stan Murphy and Terry Ewart that could plot the range to SPURV on a <b>strip</b> <b>chart</b> recorder and the x-y position on a chart plotter.|$|E
50|$|The {{continuous}} inkjet (CIJ) method is used commercially for marking and coding {{of products and}} packages. In 1867, Lord Kelvin patented the syphon recorder, which recorded telegraph signals as a continuous trace on paper using an ink jet nozzle deflected by a magnetic coil. The first commercial devices (medical <b>strip</b> <b>chart</b> recorders) were introduced in 1951 by Siemens.|$|E
50|$|Some digital {{oscilloscopes}} can sweep {{at speeds}} as slow as once per hour, emulating a <b>strip</b> <b>chart</b> recorder.That is, the signal scrolls {{across the screen}} from right to left. Most oscilloscopes with this facility switch from a sweep to a strip-chart mode at about one sweep per ten seconds. This is because otherwise, the scope looks broken: it's collecting data, but the dot cannot be seen.|$|E
5000|$|A chart {{recorder}} is an electromechanical device that records an electrical or mechanical input trend onto {{a piece of}} paper (the chart). Chart recorders may record several inputs using different color pens and may record onto <b>strip</b> <b>charts</b> or circular charts. Chart recorders may be entirely mechanical with clockwork mechanisms, electro-mechanical with an electrical clockwork mechanism for driving the chart (with mechanical or pressure inputs), or entirely electronic with no mechanical components at all (a virtual {{chart recorder}}).|$|R

The drawn sound {{technique}} {{which appeared in}} the late 1920s, is notable as a precursor of today's intuitive graphical user interfaces. On this technique, notes and various sound parameters were controlled by hand-drawn waves on the films, resembling piano rolls or <b>strip</b> <b>charts</b> on the modern sequencers/DAWs. It was often utilized on early experiments of electronic music, including Variophone developed by Yevgeny Sholpo in 1930, and Oramics designed by Daphne Oram in 1957, etc.|$|R

5000|$|Lippold discerned that an 8-12 Hz range {{physiological}} tremor {{was associated}} with the contraction of human muscles indicated a connection between psychological stress and its effect on the human body. On September 5, 1972, three retired U.S. Army officers—Allan D. Bell Jr., Wilson H. Ford, and Charles R. McQuiston—filed a U.S. patent under their corporation name, Dektor Counterintelligence and Security, Inc. for their “physiological response analysis method and apparatus.”. Bell's expertise was in counterintelligence, Ford's was in electronics, and McQuiston's was in polygraphy. Ford had invented an electronic device that utilized the theory of Lippold, Halliday, and Redfearn in which he tape-recorded the human voice, slowed it down to one-third or one-fourth its normal rate, and fed it through several low pass filters which then fed the signal into an EKG <b>strip</b> <b>chart</b> recorder. The <b>strip</b> <b>chart</b> recorder then made chart tracings on heat-sensitive paper. Their Psychological Stress Evaluator (PSE) was the first commercially available VSA. According to Allan Bell Enterprises, [...] "All lie-detection examinations or evaluations are predicated upon the fact that telling a significant lie will produce some degree of psychological stress. Psychological stress, in turn, causes a number of physiological changes.".|$|E
25|$|The {{tachograph}} was {{a device}} that monitors speed and driving and rest times. One {{of the way to}} record the information is the old method using a paper chart (analogue tachograph). The chart recorder is an electromechanical device that records an electrical or mechanical input trend onto a piece of paper (the chart). Chart recorders may record several inputs using different color pens and may record onto <b>strip</b> <b>charts</b> or circular charts.

The {{core of the}} system is designed around a Windows NT based, multi-threaded data acquisition and control server, and several smart, task-specific clients with friendly GUIs. The server supports multiple simultaneous client connections. Each client connection operates in its own thread of execution, which has a lower priority than the real-time acquisition and control thread. Time synchronization among servers and clients is achieved through Network Time Protocol (NTP).

50|$|GFAA {{spectrometry}} instruments {{have the}} following basic features: 1. {{a source of}} light (lamp) that emits resonance line radiation; 2. an atomization chamber (graphite tube) in which the sample is vaporized; 3. a monochromator for selecting {{only one of the}} characteristic wavelengths (visible or ultraviolet) of the element of interest; 4. a detector, generally a photomultiplier tube (light detectors that are useful in low-intensity applications), that measures the amount of absorption; 5. a signal processor-computer system (<b>strip</b> <b>chart</b> recorder, digital display, meter, or printer).|$|E
5000|$|The {{associated}} software had {{a variety}} of modes, including a real-time display and a recording chart. In {{the case of the}} Temperature Module, for instance, the system could display a thermometer showing the instantaneous temperature, or a <b>strip</b> <b>chart</b> continually recording the temperature over time. The system was controlled mainly through a joystick plugged into one of the other ports. Since the [...] register could also be read from Atari BASIC using [...] commands, writing custom software for the system was a simple task.|$|E
5000|$|Depending on {{the source}} of current for the loop, devices may be {{classified}} as active (supplying or [...] "sourcing" [...] power) or passive (relying on or [...] "sinking" [...] loop power). For example, a chart recorder may provide loop power to a pressure transmitter. The pressure transmitter modulates the current on the loop to send the signal to the <b>strip</b> <b>chart</b> recorder, but does not in itself supply power to the loop and so is passive. Another loop may contain two passive chart recorders, a passive pressure transmitter, and a 24 V battery. (The battery is the active device). Note that a 4-wire instrument has a power supply input separate from the current loop.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} adopted for marking paper. In the telegraphic siphon recorder of 1858 a fine capillary tube is connected to an ink reservoir and is deflected by the process signal. In modern <b>strip</b> <b>chart</b> recorders, a disposable cartridge combining both a fiber-tipped pen and ink reservoir has been used. Other types of recorder use a heated stylus and thermally sensitive paper, an impact printer using a ribbon and an electrically operated hammer, an electric signal acting through a stylus onto electro-sensitive paper, or an electric spark that makes a visible spot on aluminized paper. One form of sensitive and high-speed recorder used beams of ultraviolet light reflected off mirror galvanometers, directed at light-sensitive paper.|$|E
50|$|Mud logging (or Wellsite Geology) is a {{well logging}} process in which {{drilling}} mud and drill bit cuttings from the formation are evaluated during drilling and their properties recorded on a <b>strip</b> <b>chart</b> as a visual analytical tool and stratigraphic cross sectional representation of the well. The drilling mud which is analyzed for hydrocarbon gases, by use of a gas chromatograph, contains drill bit cuttings which are visually evaluated by a mudlogger and then described in the mud log. The total gas, chromatograph record, lithological sample, pore pressure, shale density,D-exponent, etc. (all lagged parameters because they are circulated {{up to the surface}} from the bit) are plotted along with surface parameters such as rate of penetration (ROP), Weight On Bit (WOB),rotation per minute etc. on the mudlog which serve as a tool for the mudlogger, drilling engineers, mud engineers, and other service personnel charged with drilling and producing the well.|$|E
5000|$|Ross came to MIT in {{the fall}} of 1951 as a Teaching Assistant in the Mathematics Department. His wife, Pat, was a [...] "computer banging away on a Marchant calculator" [...] at Lincoln Laboratory before it officially took over the Whirlwind computer. Her group used the Servomechanisms Labs analog {{correlation}} computer, built by Norbert Wiener. It had ball-and-disk integrators and arms used to hand trace <b>strip</b> <b>chart</b> curves of radar noise data. When the machine was in use, variables in equations were represented by rotations in its shafts. These were connected with mechanical pens which plot an accurate curve worked out by the shafts continuous movement. Interpreted correctly, this curve gave a graphic solution to the problem.

Evolving from the days of mass spectra on <b>strip</b> <b>charts</b> analyzed with a magnifying glass, a 9 H pencil and a Marchant calculator, the development of the first mass spectrometers with computerized data acquisiton by Wasserburg and Papanastassiou was driven by the recognition that potentially unfavorable parent/daughter ratios in meteoritic and lunar materials required another decimal point in the precision of isotopic ratios for geochronological purposes. The obvious importance of trace element and isotopic analysis in small areas of relatively rare, but not always perfectly preserved, meteoritical materials such as Ca- Al-rich inclusions spurred the development of ion probes...|$|R
5000|$|Tools {{to detect}} {{oil and gas}} have been {{evolving}} for over a century. The simplest and most direct tool is well cuttings examination. Some older oilmen ground the cuttings between their teeth and tasted to see if crude oil was present. Today, a wellsite geologist or mudlogger uses a low powered stereoscopic microscope to determine the lithology of the formation being drilled and to estimate porosity and possible oil staining. A portable ultraviolet light chamber or [...] "Spook Box" [...] is {{used to examine the}} cuttings for fluorescence. Fluorescence can be an indication of crude oil staining, or of the presence of fluorescent minerals. They can be differentiated by placing the cuttings in a solvent filled watchglass or dimple dish. The solvent is usually carbon tetrachlorethane. Crude oil dissolves and then redeposits as a fluorescent ring when the solvent evaporates. The written <b>strip</b> <b>chart</b> recording of these examinations is called a sample log or mudlog.|$|E
50|$|Commercial {{and naval}} fathometers of yesteryear used a <b>strip</b> <b>chart</b> {{recorder}} where an advancing {{roll of paper}} was marked by a stylus to make a permanent copy of the depth, usually with some means of also recording time (Each mark or time 'tic' is proportional to distance traveled) so that the strip charts could be readily compared to navigation charts and maneuvering logs (speed changes). Much of the world's ocean depths have been mapped using such recording strips. Fathometers of this type usually offered multiple (chart advance) speed settings, and sometimes, multiple frequencies as well. (Deep Ocean—Low Frequency carries better, Shallows—high frequency shows smaller structures (like fish, submerged reefs, wrecks, or other bottom composition features of interest.) At high frequency settings, high chart speeds, such fathometers give {{a picture of the}} bottom and any intervening large or schooling fish that can be related to position. Fathometers of the constant recording type are still mandated for all large vessels (100+ tons displacement) in restricted waters (i.e. generally, within 15 mi of land).|$|E

The first data character worked as it had under the VT55, and thus provided backward compatibility. The second turned on the new features. The second character sent to the A controlled shading lines and the strip-chart feature; least significant bit, bit 0, set the shade line data sent with @ to be loaded into graph 0 or graph 1, while bits 2 and 3 turned the shade line on or off for graph 0 or 1, respectively. Turning on bit 3 allowed <b>strip</b> <b>charts</b> to be used, while bit 4 turned it on for both graphs, the dual strip feature.
