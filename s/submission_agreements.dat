40|$|Following the {{recommendations}} of IFLA and UNESCO to treat electronic resources as {{an important part of}} the national heritage, the project “The Electronic Resources Subsystem within the Lithuanian Integrated Library Information System” (LIBIS, Lietuvos integrali bibliotekų informacijos sistema) was started. A national archive of electronic resources will be created following the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) model, developed by the Networked European Deposit Library (NEDLIB) programme. From the very start of the project, it was recognized that, due to the application of the OAIS model, a deposit library could benefit from the advantages of international standardization including the model of the archive, terminology and the conceptual framework. The OAIS model defines the environment surrounding the archive and the interactions between modules and subsystems within the existing system including cataloguing, bibliographic control and OPAC. Two interacting processes have been defined, through which all input and output interactions with the archive take place: “Delivery and Capture” at the input side and “Packing and Delivery” at the output side of the archive. The LIBIS Electronic Resources Subsystem, based on the OAIS model, will ensure its function as a virtual library interacting with the LIBIS Cataloguing Module, National Bibliographic Data Bank, Analytical Bibliographic Data Bank, Union Catalogue and OPAC of the National Library through two relational modules – Delivery and Capture, and Packaging and Delivery. The documentation prepared under the project defines: – selection of items for the Archive of Electronic Resources; – negotiating <b>submission</b> <b>agreements</b> with publishers and holders of electronic resources; – cataloguing rules for electronic resources; – archival storage and long-term preservation within the Archive of Electronic Resources; – organizational/functional structure of the LIBIS Electronic Resources Subsystem...|$|E

The control is kept by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The control activities of this organization have to secure that any help offered by itself, by its request, or under its supervision or control cannot be diverted into any military goals. The control activities of the Agency in this scope have to preclude any proliferation of nuclear technology by means of eliminating the situations of inadequate utilization of the Organization's assistance by a State and to prevent a seizure or increase in an army nuclear supplies used and produced in the objects subjected to the safeguards system of the IAEA. The control activities of the Agency is regulated by many acts, the essential ones are: the IAEA Statute, the Safeguards Document, the Inspectors Document. They provide the key model of the control system. These provisions are specified in the Safeguards Agreements. The agreements are concluded between the Agency and one or several member states and they contain commitments of the states- -parties to the agreement to use materials equipment and installations subjected to the IAEA safeguards solely for peaceful goals, the organization is granted the right to control carrying out the commitments of the contracting states.

The Geneva Convention is substantially in force also in England, but not in the United States and Latin-America. With respect to these non-contracting countries, the former state of the law is still in force. A general presentation of the subject will require, therefore, a discussion of foreign awards apart from the Geneva Convention, and under the provisions of the Convention. No attempt will be made to deal with the bilateral treaties that have been entered into, and the discussion will be limited to a few European and Latin-American countries whose law is of special interest.

40|$|IWRM-led water {{reforms in}} {{southern}} Africa have emphasised {{the creation of}} new institutions with little explanation regarding how the institutions can effectively engage with stakeholders at different levels, especially at the local level. This is {{despite the fact that the}} subsidiarity principle, which advocates for water management to be undertaken at the lowest appropriate level, which can be taken as the local level, is well recognised in water resources management. The main objective of the study was to investigate the applicability of the subsidiarity principle, especially the concept of â€˜localâ€™ participation in the Limpopo Basin at different (regional, basin, national and local) levels. The study investigated how the SADC regional frameworks provided for local participation by analysing participation clauses/provisions in the SADC Protocol on Shared Watercourses, the Regional Water Policy (RWP), the Regional Water Strategy (RWS), and the Regional Strategic Action Plans on Integrated Water Resources Development and Management (RSAP-IWRM). The appropriateness of basin agreements, as well national frameworks in relation to local participation in transboundary water resource management, was also examined. To investigate issues at the local level a sample of three wards in Shashe subcatchment of Mzingwane catchment in Zimbabwe was selected. Data was collected through key informants, focus group discussions and observations. As a framework which gives a guide on how shared watercourses can be managed in the region, the Protocol does not contain specific provisions for local participation. The study investigated the specifics of local participation in the Regional Policy and Strategy, the basin agreements, and national frameworks. While the RWP and RWS were found to contain some provisions for local participation the implementation details were lacking. Provisions for local participation at the basin level, as represented by the Technical Committee (LBPTC) were wanting. Provisions in the suggested basin institution (LIMCOM) were not realised because of non ratification of the <b>agreement.</b> <b>Submissions</b> of local people regarding how they can meaningfully participate in transboundary water resource management was based on practical realities: identification of stakeholder groups was according to water uses in the locality; stakeholder representation was based on the ward with the district level forming an intermediate level to the subcatchment and catchment level.

40|$|Key Points: The {{market failure}} that the National Access Regime should address {{is a lack}} of {{effective}} competition in markets for infrastructure services due to natural monopoly. This is likely to constitute an economic problem where service providers deny access to, or restrict output and charge monopoly prices for, their facilities and access is required for third parties to compete effectively in dependent markets. Regulated access to infrastructure services can promote competition and investment in dependent markets and generate benefits to the community. These benefits must be weighed against the costs of the Regime, including any negative effects on investment in infrastructure due to the threat of regulated access. Reforms are necessary to better target the Regime to the economic problem so that the use of access regulation is confined to where it is most likely to generate net benefits to the community. Proposed amendments to the declaration criteria seek to achieve this outcome. The Regime grants third parties a right to negotiate access with the service provider after the designated Minister 2 ̆ 7 declares 2 ̆ 7 a particular infrastructure service. Although declaration has been rare, this does not mean the Regime has been unsuccessful. Only in exceptional cases should access to an infrastructure service be regulated. The negotiate–arbitrate framework is appropriate for a generic access regime. Primacy should continue to be given to negotiation between service providers and access seekers, underpinned by a credible threat of regulated access in certain cases. Amendments to the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cwlth) and the High Court judgment on the Pilbara rail case mean that merits reviews by the Australian Competition Tribunal will likely be more confined and not take as long as in the past. On balance, it is anticipated that these changes will provide an appropriate form of limited merits review that should contribute to sound decisions. Regulatory and investment certainty would be improved if there was greater transparency as to how the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission would exercise its power to direct extensions to infrastructure facilities. A number of governments have indicated that further privatisation of infrastructure facilities will occur. It is important that appropriate access arrangements are in place before government infrastructure is privatised, as this will reduce regulatory and investment uncertainty for service providers, access seekers and investors. Industry-specific access regimes appear to have worked well. However, before any additional industry-specific regimes are introduced, it would need to be clearly demonstrated that there is a policy problem that is best addressed by access regulation, and that regulation would be best implemented at the industry level. The certification process should be reformed to improve regulatory certainty. There {{does not appear to be}} a need for additional mandatory undertakings at this time. Where mandatory undertakings are used, they should be subject to upfront and ongoing assessment to ensure that the benefits outweigh the costs.
