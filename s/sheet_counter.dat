30|$|Cyclic voltammetry {{measurement}} {{was performed}} using an electrochemical workstation of Keithley SMU 2400 source meter (Cleveland, OH, USA) and conventional three-electrode system, which was consisted of carbon composites- or Pt-coated working electrode, a Pt <b>sheet</b> <b>counter</b> electrode and a calomel reference electrode (ALS Co., Ltd., Japan). These electrodes were immersed in 10  mM LiI, 1  mM I 2 acetonitrile, and 0.1  M LiClO 4 mixed solution.|$|E
40|$|Restricted Access. In this work, we {{show that}} milk can act as an {{electrolytic}} medium to study electrochemical processes {{in the absence of}} any supporting electrolyte. The electrontransfer properties of three different redox systems in bovine homogenized whole milk, skimmed milk, and reconstituted milk powder have been studied by cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy using a three-electrode system with a gold disk working electrode, a platinum <b>sheet</b> <b>counter</b> electrode, and a standard calomel reference electrode. It has been shown that the milk incredibly sustains the redox reactions {{in the absence of any}} supporting electrolyte and the electrochemical responses are comparable to those obtained when the same reactions were carried out in standard solvent preparations containing supporting electrolytes. The study clearly demonstrates the potential of developing new innovative techniques based on the intricate concepts of electrochemistry to study various aspects of milk that may help in the development of analytical sensors for the diary industry...|$|E

50|$|The empty fields {{connecting}} the single <b>counter</b> <b>sheets</b> are called gutters. Normally they are separated {{in the middle}} after printing {{in order to obtain}} four <b>counter</b> <b>sheets.</b> The half empty fields or gutters then form the edge of the sheet. However, from many issues, unseparated gutters with connected stamps of the neighbouring sheets come on the market (stamp - empty field - stamp). These gutters may be either empty or printed, if printed edges were intended.|$|R

50|$|Back {{issues of}} Strategy & Tactics are highly valued by wargame collectors, {{and some have}} become quite expensive. S&T {{magazine}} games {{that have not been}} played and have <b>counter</b> <b>sheets</b> intact ("unpunched") are worth much more than played ("punched") games.|$|R
