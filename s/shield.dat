The 1953 <b>Shield</b> marked Blackpool's first appearance in the annual contest. By contrast, this was Arsenal's ninth Charity <b>Shield</b> appearance; prior to the game they had won six Shields (1930, 1931, 1933, 1934, 1938 and 1948), and lost two (1935 and 1936).|$|E
40|$|Introduction The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} personal <b>shields</b> in radiation departments of hospitals affiliated to Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. Materials and Methods First, the information related to 109 personal <b>shields</b> was recorded and evaluated by imaging equipment. Afterwards, the equivalent lead thickness (ELT) of 62 personal <b>shields</b> was assessed, using dosimeter and standard lead layers at 100 kVp. Results In this study, 109 personal <b>shields</b> were assessed in terms of tears, holes and cracks. The results showed that 18 <b>shields</b> were damaged. Moreover, ELT was evaluated in 62 <b>shields.</b> As the results indicated, ELT was unacceptable in 8 personal <b>shields</b> and lower than expected in 9 <b>shields.</b> Conclusion According to the results, 16. 5 % of personal <b>shields</b> had defects (tears, holes and cracks) and 13 % of them were unacceptable in terms of ELT and needed to be replaced. Therefore, regular quality control of personal <b>shields</b> and evaluation of new <b>shields</b> are necessary at any radiation department...|$|R
