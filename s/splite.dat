50|$|The 1931 Municipal Elections saw a {{dramatic}} change in council, with 10 of the majority Nationalist Citizens Party losing their wards. The incumbent mayor, Archibald Watson, the alderman for Toowong, was defeated, losing his ward to a rival candidate, from the Civic Reform party. Watson had been appointed acting mayor when the incumbent William Jolly retired before the end of his term. The Nationalist Citizens Party was left with only two aldermen out of 20 wards, so Watson would not have retained the Mayoralty even if he had of won his ward, as the State had changed the rules to elect Mayors by a majority vote of the aldermen. This was because the election was held during a time of brief conservative control of the State Government with Arthur Edward Moore, Premier of Queensland. It was anticipated upon the Moore Government's election that the Brisbane City Council would be broken up and that major amendments would be made to City of Brisbane Act 1924. But the critics of a Greater Brisbane were proven to be disappointed, with the rural-based Moore Government taking little interest in metropolitan affairs, and while making some significant changes it left the Council essentially intact. Universal suffrage was removed, in favour of occupier franchise and plural voting, which was expected to favour the incumbent regime. The number of aldermen were reduced by one, and the mayor was to be elected by a vote amongst the aldermen, rather than by direct election. However it was also the time of the Great Depression in Australia, which caused the demise of many administrations, including Brisbane's, and Mayor Watson was reluctantly forced to admit that Council had a large cash shortage. In addition he was taking criticism from the left from the Labor Party over the unfairness of the loss of universal suffrage, and far more severe criticism from the right from various businessmen who wanted to slash Council's costs despite the depression. The conservative vote was split between three conservative parties (Nationalist Citizens, Civic Reform and Progress), with the Civic Reform Party formed in opposition to what they saw as insufficient changes by the Moore Government, and the Progress Party supportive of the government's changes. With the conservative vote <b>splite</b> Labor Party managed to out perform expectations and win 8 wards.|$|E

40|$|Purpose of the article: The present article {{deals with}} {{associations}} between {{the development of}} money supply measured by the monetary base M 2 {{and the development of}} the Japanesee wider stock index Nikkei 225. The objective of the article is set if the money supply is significant macroeconomic factor which cause the stock bubbles. Methodology/methods: Regarding to the aim of the article was using historic monthly nominal data of money supply (measured with monetary base M 2) and monthly close price of Nikkei 225 since 1967 to 2011, adjusted of <b>splites</b> and dividends. This period contain two bubbles which were on japanesee market and the time of economic crisis after 2007. From econometric methods, will be using stationary test – Augmented Dickey- Fuller test, for cointegration between two time series is using Engel-Granger cointegration test and the impact of money supply on japanesee stock index is measured by Granger causality test. Scientific aim: The aim of this article is by using econometric methods find if the nominal money supply, measured by monetary base M 2 is a significant factor, which cause the stock bubbles on japanesee stock market. Findings: According to the results of the empirical analysis was found that mnominal money supply represented by wider monetary base M 2 is not a significant factor which cause the bubbles, which were identify on japanese stock market in selected period. Concrete wasn’t found the impact of money supply on Archipelago boom in 70 th and Heisei boom in the 80 th. In empirical analysis was only found a long relationship (cointegration) between money supply and stock index Nikkei 225, what correspond with economic theory. Conclusions: This paper can be expand with real variables (inflation adjusted) and compare the result. Higher potencial of this paper is added there another macroeconomic variables, first of all oil price or producer price index, because according to the literature review this can be a significant factors which cabn cause the bubbles and find relationship between these factors and japanese stock index development. Other way is compare the results with e. g. US capital maret, which suppport the market and economy by quantitative easing too...|$|R

The treatments included : cultivars (Darab- 14, Jiroft and Yazdi) assigned to main plots, nitrogen fertilizer (0, 25 and 50 kg ha- 1) and biofertilizer (inoculation and no-inoculation) as factorial were randomized in sub-plots. Oil percent was measured using the Soxhlet method and fatty acid composition was measured using GC method. Results showed the significant differenc among three varieties concerning seed yield, oil yield and four fatty acids (oleic, linoleic, palmetic and stearis acid). Seed yield, oil yield, Oleic, Linolenic and Arasshidic acid significantly increased with applying N fertilizer. Seed yield, oil yield and linolenic acid percent significantly increased with applying biofertilizer. Oleic acid percent had negative and significant correlation with Linoleic acid (r = - 0. 759 **) and stearic acid (r=- 0. 774 **) percent.
