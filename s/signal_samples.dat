5000|$|In signal processing, a [...] kernel {{adaptive}} filter {{is a type}} of nonlinear {{adaptive filter}}. An adaptive filter is a filter that adapts its transfer function to changes in signal properties over time by minimizing an error or loss function that characterizes how far the filter deviates from ideal behavior. The adaptation process is based on learning from a sequence of <b>signal</b> <b>samples</b> and is thus an online algorithm. A nonlinear adaptive filter is one in which the transfer function is nonlinear.|$|E
50|$|A key {{advantage}} of OFDM is that fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) {{may be used}} to simplify implementation. Fourier transforms convert signals {{back and forth between the}} time domain and frequency domain. Consequently, Fourier transforms can exploit the fact that any complex waveform may be decomposed into a series of simple sinusoids. In signal processing applications, discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs) are used to operate on real-time <b>signal</b> <b>samples.</b> DFTs may be applied to composite OFDM signals, avoiding the need for the banks of oscillators and demodulators associated with individual subcarriers. Fast Fourier transforms are numerical algorithms used by computers to perform DFT calculations.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{a number}} of {{short-lived}} [...] "hybrid" [...] studio and consumer technologies appeared in this period (e.g. Digital Audio Tape or DAT, which recorded digital <b>signal</b> <b>samples</b> onto standard magnetic tape), Sony assured the preeminence of its new digital recording system by introducing, together with Philips, the most advanced consumer audio format to date — the digital compact disc (CD). The Compact disc rapidly replaced both the 12" [...] album and the 7" [...] single as the new standard consumer format, and ushered {{in a new era}} of high-fidelity consumer audio — CDs were small, portable and durable, and they could reproduce the entire audible sound spectrum, with unrestricted dynamic range, perfect clarity and no distortion. Because CDs were encoded and read optically, using a laser beam, there was no physical contact between the disc and the playback mechanism, so a well-cared-for CD could be played over and over, with absolutely no degradation or loss of fidelity. CDs also represented a considerable advance in both the physical size of the medium, and its storage capacity — LPs could only practically hold about 50 minutes of audio, because they were physically limited {{by the size of the}} disc itself and the density of the grooves that could be cut into it — the longer the recording, the closer together the grooves and thus the lower the overall fidelity; CDs, on the other hand they were less than half the overall size of the old 12" [...] LP format, but offered about double the duration of the average LP, with up to 80 minutes of audio.|$|E

This description gives a clear relationship between uniform and recurrent nonuniform discrete-time sampling schemes. A side benefit of this model is an efficient structure with which one can reconstruct uniform discrete-time Nyquist <b>signal</b> <b>samples</b> from recurrent nonuniform samples with known mutual delays between the nonuniform distributed samples.
