5000|$|Statue of Liberty plates {{used the}} word [...] "Liberty" [...] in the 3M <b>security</b> <b>mark</b> in the ABC 123 serial format {{and in the early}} 1AB 234 format. During 1990 the <b>security</b> <b>mark</b> changed from [...] "Liberty" [...] to a year designation. 1990, 1991, and 1992 were used.

The year <b>security</b> <b>marks</b> only denote the year the {{sheeting}} was manufactured; the plates may actually date somewhat later. Neither the ABC 123 nor the 1AB 234 formats were issued consecutively; e.g. plates ABD 768 and UVK 767 could have been issued the same day in 1986.

40|$|DE 19822605 A UPAB: 20000112 NOVELTY - To form {{a durable}} marking {{in the top}} layer of paper substrates, {{at least one of the}} lower layers is treated with laser energy before the top layer is applied. The top layer is opaque using a {{printing}} and/or at least a varnish and/or at least a metallizing or combinations of them. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A coating is directly under the top paper layer, which has no pigments or contains white or colored pigments. The coating is calendered and can also be varnished. The same process can be used with layers of thicker fiber webs, of natural fibers, to give a cardboard product. The laser energy metallizes the surface to take printing and/or a varnish. The lower layer surface is treated with a carbon dioxide laser. The metallizing process uses copper, aluminum, gold or silver. The marking is a logo, name, trade mark, an image, or a <b>security</b> <b>marking.</b> The paper substrate is in a weight of 40 - 400 g/m 2. USE - The process is for the development of a durable marking in the paper or cardboard material, such as would be provided by a watermark or for the security of the document. ADVANTAGE - The material gives an effective reflection of the marking through the top layer. When the top layer has been applied to the paper substrates, no further processing is required...|$|E
40|$|Digital Micromirror Devices (DMDs), {{containing}} {{arrays of}} around one million individually-controllable ~ 10 µm square mirrors, provide an extremely cost-effective and practical method to modulate the spatial beam {{profile of a}} pulsed laser source for both additive and subtractive laser processing and printing. When demagnified {{by a factor of}} ~ 100 in one dimension (hence ~ 10, 000 in area) a ~ 1 mJ/cm 2 laser pulse reflected from the mirrors on the DMD surface that are switched to the 'on' position, attains a fluence of ~ 10 J/cm 2 at the workpiece, which is more than sufficient to ablate most materials of interest to the laser-manufacturing community. More familiar in the context of high values of magnification by the laser projection industry, reversing the role to use them for equally high values of demagnification opens up a wealth of possibilities for ablation, multiphoton polymerization, <b>security</b> <b>marking</b> and fabrication of features that perhaps surprisingly can be well below the wavelength of the laser used. Of key relevance is that very high-resolution patterning can be achieved by a single laser pulse, and step-and-repeat processes, when combined with the refresh rates of the DMD pattern that are currently at the 30 kHz level, open up the possibility of processing areas of up to 1 cm 2 per second with micron-scale resolution where each ~ 100 µm x 100 µm area patterned per pulse can display arbitrary pixelated content. We will discuss the application of DMD-baser laser processing to the following areas of interest to the laser-manufacturing community...|$|E
40|$|The laser {{has gained}} {{significant}} {{attention in the}} field of surface texturing due to its numerous benefits over competing processes. A peculiar effect of the laser observed when processing under specific circumstances close to the material ablation threshold is self aligning ripple-like structures, known commonly as laser induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS). Research surrounding the ultrashort pulse production of LIP SS has identified potential for their application as a direct texturing tool. Femtosecond laser systems are not currently applicable to industrial use due to low throughput {{as a result of the}} complex nature of femtosecond pulse production. With their improved simplicity and throughput potential, picosecond laser systems are emerging as a more promising choice for industrial laser applications. This thesis aims to gain an understanding of LIPSS production with 10, 20 and 80 picosecon~ pulses in order to allow generation of these features at throughput levels more fitting to industrial applications. Detailed experimentation of the production of LIPSS under varymg processmg parameters including pulse length, pulse energy, traverse speed, traverse direction, and incident angle has been carried out. Results showed significant dependence upon incident intensity, pulse number, beam profile and intensity distribution. LIPSS threshold observation revealed evidence that suggested heating played an important role in the LIPSS generation mechanism demonstrated within this thesis. An investigation into the production of LIPSS with shaped beam profiles and intensity distributions through the implementation of a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) has also been carried out. A square flat top beam has been successfully recreated at the sample surface and showed potential for improvement of LIPSS uniformity in comparison to a common Gaussian beam. Finally, a number of potential applications for LIPSS have been considered. This included consideration of contact angle alteration, <b>security</b> <b>marking,</b> control over cell growth and the incorporation of LIPSS within the common injection moulding process.

30|$|We {{describe}} {{a method to}} fabricate, transfer and validate via image processing nanofibre-based, unique <b>security</b> <b>marks</b> (‘nanotags’) for anti-counterfeiting purposes. Epitaxial surface growth of oligophenylenes on a heated muscovite mica crystal results in a thin film of mutually aligned nanofibres with dimensions of tens of nanometres in height, hundreds of nanometres in width and tens to hundreds of micrometres in length. By applying a shadow mask, a film pattern is generated which contains only sparse, randomly grown nanofibres, which in turn represent a unique ‘fingerprint’ of the growth area. This fingerprint can be transferred on an adhesive tape as a label of a product, imaged using low magnification microscopy, digitalised and stored in a database. Infrared surface heating, enforced cooling and load lock transfer makes the fabrication process fast and scalable to mass production.|$|R
