40|$|In Britain, where <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> is {{classified}} as an archaeophyte of Roman introduction, there are many ancient <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> and woodlands significant for conservation, yet no dendrochronological assessment {{has been made of}} them. This paper describes an attempt to assess the dendrochronological potential of <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> wood. Eight <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> (veteran trees in parkland and mature trees and coppice-grown stems in woodland) from five sites in western England were sampled by coring living wood and by cutting sections in fallen dead wood, to enable microscopic analysis of growth ring parameters. Four trees from three sites were cross-matched to form a 295 -year chronology from AD 1716 to AD 2011. The annual resolution of the chronology was confirmed by regional cross-dating with oak reference chronologies. The ages for these <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> range from circa AD 1668 to AD 1940. It is concluded that oak reference chronologies can be used to date <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> wood, with benefits for archaeological, historic building and palaeoenvironmental assessments. The extraction of sawn sections from dead veteran trees and their dendrochronological analysis indicates a more reliable and benign approach to dating ancient trees in historic landscapes compared with coring...|$|R

The whole great hall collapsed while the queen was staying at Commernalde on 26 January 1562, and 7 or 8 men were killed. Most of the queen's party were out hunting. Mary was not hurt and visited the relatives of those who were injured or killed in the village below. Royalty often visited the town to hunt the rare Scottish ox, or white cattle, which roamed in the woods around Cumbernauld. These woods were a surviving fragment of the ancient Caledonian Forest, in which the oxen abounded at least till 1571 and probably until the building of the new house. Many of these were deliberately killed by Regent Lennox's men and a plaintiff complains: [...] "And amonges others greite enormyties perpetrated be th' erles men of werre they have slayne and destroyed the dere in John Fleming's forest of Cummernald and the quhit ky and bullis, to the gryt destructione of polecie and hinder of the commonweil.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the five-year long research results (2007 - 2011) of phenological observations (beginning, full flowering {{and the end}} of flowering), morphometric analysis (fruit weight, length, width and thickness of fruit, as well as length and width of the hilum), the ripening time and the average yield of selected genotypes of <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> (Castanea sativa Mill.). The results show that in terms of time of flowering <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> examined in the group are very early flowering. The ripening of studied <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> shows that the earliest harvest tree was Ostros II, VII and Kostajnica V (09. 11.), and Kostajnica III (14. 11.) were the latest. The average fruit weight of the selected <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> was (6. 9 g). The highest average fruit weight (10. 6 g), had the examined Ostros I tree, and the lowest (4. 8 g), Kostajnica VI. The yield of the tested <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> was on average (76. 3 kg / tree). The selected trees Kostajnica II (66. 0 kg / tree), Kostajnica I (69. 0 kg / tree) had the smallest yield and Ostros VI (94. 0 kg / tree) and Ostros V (87. 0 kg / tree) had the highest. Obviously it can be concluded that population genetic variability is very high and gene expression is highly affected in tested samples on both locations. For further research it should be given attention to investigate genotypes in controlled conditions, the best in vitro in tissue culture. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br.

40|$|We {{investigated}} roost selection by Leisler’s bat (Nyctalus leisleri) {{before and}} after hibernation in 2005 in a mountain area of southern Switzerland. The study area is dominated by deciduous trees and characterised {{by the presence of}} previously managed chestnut (Castanea sativa) orchards that are now partly abandoned. In March–May and August–October, 15 radio-tracked bats (seven males and eight females) used 28 roost trees. We analysed roosts used by N. leisleri at three different levels: (i) micro-scale: features of roost cavities; (ii) meso-scale: characteristics of selected roost trees and (iii) macro-scale: structure of woodland surrounding roost trees. Selection at meso and macro-scales was obtained comparing characteristics of roost trees and surrounding woodland with potentially available trees and woodlands. Bats roosted mainly in live <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees,</b> with large diameter and absence of vegetation near the entrance. Roost trees were located closer to streams, in woodlands with a higher percentage of <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> and a lower tree density than random trees. Multifunctional forest management in abandoned chestnut stands, comprising recreation (chestnut harvesting) and preservation of a semi-natural habitat and its related biodiversity, would recreate the traditional woodland features – in particular an open forest structure with low tree density and presence of ancient <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> – and provide suitable roosting sites to migratory N. leisler...|$|R

40|$|<b>Sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> {{cultures}} {{are a major}} component of the vegetation in many large protected areas of the Southern Alps. Since Roman times, vast areas of Southern and Western Europe have been covered by groves and coppices of <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> (Castanea sativa MILL.). Having replaced the original broadleaved forest, they used to {{play a vital role in}} traditional agriculture. Chestnut cultivation was even more important in terms of producing a substitute for cereals (bread) than for the production of timber. With changing economic conditions and the onset of chestnut blight (caused by the fungus Cryphonectria parasitica) in the 20 th century, chestnut cultivation lost almost all of its economic and cultural significance. In the last 20 years, there has been a renewed interest in preserving and replanting chestnuts. Today, this includes marketing strategies, landscape conservation and cultural history aspects. As chestnut cultivation is widespread, especially in the southern part of the Alps, its study provides links between landscape ecological research and sustainable development. This article describes different types of chestnut use and the characteristic landscapes thus generated as well as some aspects of biodiversity and landscape protection involved in the sustainable revaluation of that endogenous rural resource.

40|$|Exactly dated ring-width chronologies {{derived from}} Pyrenean oak and <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> growing in {{northern}} Extremadura, Spain, were evaluated for their potential as proxies for regional precipitation and North Atlantic Oscillation variability. The relationships among tree-rings, instrumental climatic records, and three {{versions of the}} NAO index were computed for different time subperiods over the last century. The results indicate that tree-ring records reflect, with variable intensity, both short-term and long-term variations in climate. Multiple correlation and regression analysis revealed that summer precipitation {{appeared to be the}} major factor affecting tree growth at inter-annual timescales. Moreover, since fluctuations in accumulated variability in annual rainfall over southwest Iberia are controlled by winter precipitation, the accumulated rainfall (August of the year n- 1 to July of year n) and winter NAO indices are also strongly correlated with tree-ring records at interdecadal timescales. This relationship appears to be especially strong {{during the second half of}} the 20 th century, which is consistent with an increase of the NAO signal in the annual precipitation during the later part of the century. These results indicate that tree-rings from western Iberia are potential proxies of the NAO variability, useful to be included in palaeoclimatic model studies...|$|R

5000|$|Their {{carbohydrate}} content compares {{with that of}} wheat and rice; chestnuts have twice as much starch as the potato on an as-is basis. In addition, chestnuts contain about 8% of various sugars, mainly sucrose, glucose, fructose, and, in a lesser amount, stachyose and raffinose, which are fermented in the lower gut, producing gas. In some areas, <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> are called [...] "the bread tree". When chestnuts {{are just starting to}} ripen, the fruit is mostly starch and is very firm under finger pressure from the high water content. As the chestnuts ripen, the starch is slowly converted into sugars, and moisture content also starts decreasing. Upon pressing the chestnut, a slight 'give' can be felt; the hull is not so tense, and space occurs between it and the flesh of the fruit. They are the only [...] "nuts" [...] that contain vitamin C, with about 40 mg per 100 g of raw product, which is about 65% of the U.S. recommended daily intake.
