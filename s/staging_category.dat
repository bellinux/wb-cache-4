30|$|Further, {{local control}} is a {{significant}} issue for this population. Understanding {{the limitations of the}} data, we recommend treating all distant sites at the time of PMRT in stage IV IBC only when feasible and reasonably low risk and we recognize constraining the medial border of the chest wall field to midline may be inadequate margin on the medial scar in IBC. Further validation of these studies may suggest that increased incorporation of aggressive locoregional therapies in specific subsets of patients with metastatic IBC is warranted. Clearly some of these stage IV IBC patients have achieved a durable NED status potentially suggesting that some stage IV disease in IBC may represent extended regional lymphatic spread which may be potentially curable in the setting of effective chemotherapy. With further study this could also lead to the consideration of patients with focal metastatic disease or extended regional disease as a distinct <b>staging</b> <b>category.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: This study {{compared}} {{the performance of}} endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and multislice spiral computed tomography (MSCT) in the preoperative staging of gastric cancer. Methodology/Principal Findings: A total of 610 patients participated in this study, {{all of whom had}} undergone surgical resection, had confirmed gastric cancer and were evaluated with EUS and MSCT. Tumor staging was evaluated using the Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) staging and Japanese classification. The results from the imaging modalities were compared with the postoperative histopathological outcomes. The overall accuracies of EUS and MSCT for the T <b>staging</b> <b>category</b> were 76. 7 % and 78. 2 % (P= 0. 537), respectively. Stratified analysis revealed that the accuracy of EUS for T 1 and T 2 staging was significantly higher than that of MSCT (P< 0. 001 for both) and that the accuracy of MSCT in T 3 and T 4 staging was significantly higher than that of EUS (P< 0. 001 and 0. 037, respectively). The overall accuracy of MSCT was 67. 2 % when using the 13 th edition Japanese classification, and this percentage was significantly higher than the accuracy of EUS (49. 3 %) and MSCT (44. 6 %) when using the 6 th edition UICC classification (P< 0. 001 for both values). Conclusions/Significance: Our results demonstrated that the overall accuracies of EUS and MSCT for preoperative staging were not significantly different.

40|$|In 2012, the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) {{introduced}} a novel grading system for clear cell {{renal cell carcinoma}} (ccRCC) and papillary renal cell carcinoma. This system is incorporated into the latest World Health Organization renal tumour classification, being designated WHO/ISUP grading. This study was undertaken to compare WHO/ISUP and Fuhrman grading and to validate WHO/ISUP grading as a prognostic parameter {{in a series of}} clear cell RCC. Analysis of 681 cases of ccRCC showed that 144 tumours could not be assigned a Fuhrman grade on the basis of ambiguous grading features. The application of WHO/ISUP grading resulted in a general down-grading of cases when compared with Fuhrman grading. In a sub-group of 374 cases, for which outcome data were available, 9. 3 % were WHO/ISUP grade 1, 50. 3 % were grade 2, 24. 1 % grade 3 and 16. 3 % grade 4, while the distribution of Fuhrman grades was 0. 4 % grade 1, 48. 7 % grade 2, 29. 4 % grade 3 and 21. 5 % grade 4.

Two passages developed and analysed for staging by Clements (1976) were {{used in this study}} to investigate the effects staging has on the readers' comprehension of the passages. The two passages were identical in content and different only in the staging level at which information occurred. Ten experimental texts were developed from Clements' two passages. The texts enabled (i) the comparison of the effects of supplying high, medium or low staged information to the readers on their ability to replace cloze deletions {{in the rest of the}} text: and (ii) the comparison of the effects of supplying intact the staging categories Old Topic, New Topic, Old Comment, or New Comment on the readers' ability to replace cloze deletions in the rest of the text. The cloze replacement scores were taken as measures of the readers' comprehension of the text. The subjects used in this study were a mixture of male and female, undergraduate and postgraduate students at Riverina College of Advanced Education. The height of staged information and the <b>staging</b> <b>category</b> of the information were found to have no significant affect upon the readers' comprehension of the texts. However, it is suggested 111 that this may be an artifact of the use of cloze procedure as the measure of comprehension.

40|$|Ductal {{adenocarcinoma}} of {{the prostate}} is an aggressive malignancy, often presenting at an advanced stage. In mixed ductal and acinar adenocarcinomas, {{the relationship between the}} proportion of the ductal component of the tumor and the pathologic stage and whether or not aggressive behavior is simply a function of grade remains undetermined. From 268 consecutive radical prostatectomies undertaken as a curative procedure for clinical localized prostate cancer, we identified 34 cases (12. 7 %) with ductal adenocarcinoma {{of the prostate}} comprising 5 % to 100 % of the total tumor volume. For cases with a ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate component, the mean age at diagnosis of 60 years (range 49 - 69 years), mean serum prostate-specific antigen of 8. 4 ng/mL (range, 0. 8 - 21 ng/mL) and positive surgical margin rate of 17. 6 % did not differ significantly from that of the pure adenocarcinoma group. All 34 patients with ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate had peripheral zone involvement while 16 (46 %) also had transition zone involvement. Twenty-five (73 %) cases with ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate had extraprostatic extension (pT 3), which compared to 32. 9 % with acinar adenocarcinoma. The presence of ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate (P 7 (P =. 04) significantly predicted pT 3 <b>staging</b> <b>category,</b> and the presence of ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate remained a significant predictor for pT 3, after adjusting for tumor volume and Gleason score > 7.

40|$|Abstract Background Loss of {{activity}} of tumor suppressor genes {{is considered a}} fundamental step in a genetic model of carcinogenesis. Altered expression of the p 53 and the Deleted in Colon Cancer (DCC) proteins has been described in gastric cancer and this event may {{have a role in}} the development of the disease. According to this hypothesis, we investigated the p 53 and the DCC proteins expression in different stages of gastric carcinomas. Methods An immunohistochemical analysis for detection of p 53 and DCC proteins expression was performed in tumor tissue samples of patients with UICC stage I and II gastric cancer. For the purpose of the analysis, the staining results were related to the pathologic data and compared between <b>stage</b> <b>categories.</b> Results Ninety-four cases of gastric cancer were analyzed. Disease <b>stage</b> <b>categories</b> were pT 1 N 0 in 23 cases, pT 2 N 0 in 20 cases, pT 3 N 0 in 20 cases and pT 1 - 3 with nodal involvment in 31 cases. Stage pT 1 - 2 N 0 tumors maintained a positive DCC expression while it was abolished in pT 3 N 0 tumors (p Conclusions Altered expression of both DCC and p 53 proteins is detectable in gastric carcinomas. It seems that loss of wild-type p 53 gene function and consequent p 53 overexpression may be involved in early stages of tumor progression while DCC abnormalities are a late event. </p...|$|R

40|$|Human {{endogenous}} retrovirus (HERV) -like sequences are normal inherited elements that constitute several hundredths {{of the human}} genome. The expression of genes located within these elements can occur {{as a consequence of}} several different events, including persistent inflammation or genotoxic events. Antibodies to endogenous retroviral gene products have been found in a number of infectious, chronic, and malignant diseases, suggesting a role in disease initiation and progression. We studied human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) -infected patients for evidence of urine antibody to a HERV peptide and investigated correlates with clinical and laboratory parameters. Forty-three HIV- 1 -infected patients in documented asymptomatic, symptomatic, or AIDS stages of disease and 21 age- and gender-matched, uninfected controls were tested for antibody to HERV-related peptide 4. 1. Urine specimens were examined in a blinded fashion with the Calypte Biomedical Corp. experimental enzyme immunoassay for antibody to peptide 4. 1. Results were compared with demographic data, medical history, clinical state of disease, and results of other laboratory tests. Thirty-six percent of the asymptomatic (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] category A) and 81. 3 % of both the symptomatic (CDC category B) and AIDS (CDC category C) patients were positive for antibody to HERV-related peptide 4. 1.
