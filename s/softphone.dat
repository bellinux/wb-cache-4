40|$|Abstractâ€”Voice over Internet Protocol based systems replace {{phone lines}} in many {{scenarios}} {{and are in}} wide use today. Automated security tests of such systems are required to detect implementation and configuration mistakes early and in an efficient way. In this paper we present a plugin for our fuzzer framework fuzzolution to automatically detect security vulnerabilities in Session Initiation Protocol based Voice over Internet Protocol <b>softphones,</b> which are examples for endpoints in such telephone systems. The presented approach automates the interaction with the Graphical User Interface of the <b>softphones</b> during test execution and also observes {{the behavior of the}} <b>softphones</b> using multiple metrics. Results of testing two open source <b>softphones</b> by using our fuzzer showed that various unknown vulnerabilities could be identified with the implemented plugin for our fuzzing framework.

Often a <b>softphone</b> is designed to behave like a traditional telephone, sometimes appearing as an image of a phone, with a display panel and buttons with which the user can interact. A <b>softphone</b> is usually used with a headset connected to the sound card of the PC, or with a USB phone.|$|E
