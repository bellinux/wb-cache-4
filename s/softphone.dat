40|$|Abstract—Voice over Internet Protocol based systems replace {{phone lines}} in many {{scenarios}} {{and are in}} wide use today. Automated security tests of such systems are required to detect implementation and configuration mistakes early and in an efficient way. In this paper we present a plugin for our fuzzer framework fuzzolution to automatically detect security vulnerabilities in Session Initiation Protocol based Voice over Internet Protocol <b>softphones,</b> which are examples for endpoints in such telephone systems. The presented approach automates the interaction with the Graphical User Interface of the <b>softphones</b> during test execution and also observes {{the behavior of the}} <b>softphones</b> using multiple metrics. Results of testing two open source <b>softphones</b> by using our fuzzer showed that various unknown vulnerabilities could be identified with the implemented plugin for our fuzzing framework.

50|$|A <b>softphone</b> is a {{software}} program for making telephone calls over the Internet using a general purpose computer, rather than using dedicated hardware. The <b>softphone</b> can also be installed {{on a piece of}} equipment such as a workstation, portable computer, tablet or even a cellphone and allows the user to place and receive calls without requiring an actual telephone set. Often a <b>softphone</b> is designed to behave like a traditional telephone, sometimes appearing as an image of a phone, with a display panel and buttons with which the user can interact. A <b>softphone</b> is usually used with a headset connected to the sound card of the PC, or with a USB phone.|$|E

50|$|Accordingly, {{by the end}} of 2011, {{for under}} US$3000 it was {{possible}} to build an office VoIP system based entirely on cordless technology capable of several hundred meters reach and on Power over Ethernet dedicated wired phones, with up to 8 DID lines and 3 simultaneous conversations per base station, with 24 handsets each capable of communicating on any subset of the 8 lines, plus an unlimited number of <b>softphones</b> running on computers and laptops and smartphones. This compared favourably to proprietary PBX technology especially as VoIP cordless was far cheaper than PBX cordless.|$|R
