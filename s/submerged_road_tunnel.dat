40|$|Urban <b>road</b> <b>tunnels</b> {{provide an}} {{increasingly}} cost-effective engineering solution, especially in compact cities like Singapore. For some urban <b>road</b> <b>tunnels,</b> tunnel {{characteristics such as}} tunnel configurations, geometries, provisions of tunnel electrical and mechanical systems, traffic volumes, etc. may vary from one section to another. These urban <b>road</b> <b>tunnels</b> that have characterized nonuniform parameters {{are referred to as}} nonhomogeneous urban <b>road</b> <b>tunnels.</b> In this study, a novel quantitative risk assessment (QRA) model is proposed for nonhomogeneous urban <b>road</b> <b>tunnels</b> because the existing QRA models for <b>road</b> <b>tunnels</b> are inapplicable to assess the risks in these <b>road</b> <b>tunnels.</b> This model uses a tunnel segmentation principle whereby a nonhomogeneous urban <b>road</b> <b>tunnel</b> is divided into various homogenous sections. Individual risk for <b>road</b> <b>tunnel</b> sections as well as the integrated risk indices for the entire <b>road</b> <b>tunnel</b> is defined. The article then proceeds to develop a new QRA model for each of the homogeneous sections. Compared to the existing QRA models for <b>road</b> <b>tunnels,</b> this section-based model incorporates one additional top event-toxic gases due to traffic congestion-and employs the Poisson regression method to estimate the vehicle accident frequencies of tunnel sections. This article further illustrates an aggregated QRA model for nonhomogeneous urban tunnels by integrating the section-based QRA models. Finally, a case study in Singapore is carried out.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is the {{analysis}} of current state of tunnel equipment in Slovenian <b>road</b> <b>tunnels</b> and suggestions for its improvements. From safety point of view an extra thoughtfulness needs {{to be applied to}} the matter of driving through <b>road</b> <b>tunnels</b> because of the feeling of constriction while driving through them. Slovenian highway cross consists of two main European transport corridors and represents an important part of Pan-european transport network. That is why European Directive for minimal safety requirements for <b>road</b> <b>tunnels</b> 2004 / 54 /ES came into effect in 2004. Although the status of current tunnel equipment in Slovenian <b>road</b> <b>tunnels</b> is acceptable, it differs among them. For reaching a higher goal in maintaining a satisfactory level of safety in <b>road</b> <b>tunnels,</b> it is necessary to eliminate the differences between types of equipment and its positioning on site. Taken into consideration that human behaviour plays the biggest role in <b>road</b> <b>tunnel</b> safety we also need to consider the effects of type of the vehicle, traffic surroundings and definitely of road infrastructure for safety in <b>road</b> <b>tunnels.</b> Only with unification of different types of equipment and its positioning in tunnels will we achieve the proper safety level in our <b>road</b> <b>tunnels.</b> Often the installation of <b>road</b> <b>tunnel</b> equipment and its positioning is left to the preference of the design engineers and contractors, because there are no guidelines to follow.

40|$|Electrostatic Precipitator (ESP) {{is applied}} for <b>road</b> <b>tunnel.</b> ESP can remove SPM (Suspended Particulate Matter) {{in the air}} using Corona Discharge Plasma. ESP for <b>road</b> <b>tunnel</b> is used to deliver {{visibility}} inside the <b>road</b> <b>tunnel</b> and to preserve environment around opening from the <b>road</b> <b>tunnel.</b> The tunnel owner wants to reduce the tunnel auxiliary space like ESP because the civil cost of <b>road</b> <b>tunnel</b> is very expensive. So that ESP is required to treat very high air velocity and large air volume in this limited space. In Japan, the first standard ESP is determined to treat air volume is 3. 75 m 3 /s, 7 m/s air flow velocity inside the ESP. The latest one is determined to treat 5 m 3 /s, 9 m/s. In recent years, the requirement of the environmental preservation around opening from the <b>road</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{is so strong that}} ESP is applied to some aged tunnel ventilation stations. To apply ESP in aged tunnel ventilation, the space for ESP is extremely limited that it has to treat larger air volume and higher air velocity are required. We developed innovative ESP which is used saw edge electrode with zigzag edges and it realizes 7. 2 m 3 /s, 13 m/s.

40|$|Abstract—It is {{well known}} that the {{electromagnetic}} (EM) waves do not propagate well in <b>road</b> <b>tunnels.</b> The channel characteristics for empty tunnels have already been well analyzed by both theoretical and numerical/experimental methods. However, any <b>road</b> <b>tunnels</b> are full with running vehicles. Currently a few works have investigated the influence of the vehicles on the signal propagation in <b>road</b> <b>tunnels.</b> However, they are all limited to experimental or numerical results. This paper provides a theoretical mode-based analysis to give the straightforward description of the wireless channel in <b>road</b> <b>tunnels</b> with traffic flow. First the effects of a single vehicle in the tunnel are investigated. The analytical expressions of the in-mode loss and the mode coupling are provided using uniform theory of diffraction (UTD), Poisson summation formula and saddle point method.
