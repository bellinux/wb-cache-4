30|$|For {{medium-sized}} series (< 1, 000 parts), mechanised moulding {{and casting}} lines are used. Lost mould foundries utilise mould <b>making</b> <b>machines.</b> This implies {{the use of}} green sand, which allows fast mould making. The size of the mould <b>making</b> <b>machine</b> limits the maximum size of the castings. Casting can be performed manually or using a pouring machine. Auxiliary side processes, such as sand preparation, are operated in a semi-automated way with remote control. Both continuous furnaces (cupola, shaft) and batch furnaces are used.|$|R
