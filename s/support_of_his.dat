5|$|At {{about the}} same time, Belaur, a brother of Michael Asen III, rebelled in Vidin, {{probably}} in <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> deposed nephew Ivan Stefan's claim to the throne. The advance of the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos against Bulgaria {{in the summer of}} 1332 protracted military operations against the rebels. The Byzantines overran Bulgarian-controlled northeastern Thrace, but Ivan Alexander rushed southward with a small army and swiftly caught up with Andronikos III at Rusokastro.|$|E
5|$|At {{least in}} part resentful of the French king's {{previous}} <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Lancastrian opponents, and possibly in <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brother-in-law Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy, Edward went to parliament in October 1472 for funding a military campaign, and eventually landed in Calais on 4 July 1475. Richard's was the largest private contingent of his army. Although well known to have publicly been against the eventual treaty signed with Louis XI at Picquigny (and absent from the negotiations, in which one of his rank would {{have been expected to}} take a leading role), he acted as Edward's witness when the king instructed his delegates to the French court, and received 'some very fine presents' from Louis on a visit to the French king at Amiens. In refusing other gifts, which included 'pensions' in the guise of 'tribute', he was joined only by Cardinal Bourchier. He supposedly disapproved of Edward's policy of personally benefitting—politically and financially—from a campaign paid for out of a parliamentary grant, and hence out of public funds. Any military prowess was therefore not to be revealed further until the last years of Edward's reign.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{that and}} four other reasons given by Coke, the college was to stop trying to {{supervise}} medical practice, arbitrating and acting as a court. In <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> judgment, Coke cited not only Tregor's Case but also two anonymous cases with the academic names of Cessavit 42 and Annuitie 11, respectively.|$|E
5|$|On the January 16, 2012, episode, Colbert satirically {{encouraged}} his {{viewers to}} vote for Herman Cain in the South Carolina primary. As Cain {{was still on the}} ballot, despite having recently dropped out of the race, Colbert announced that he would consider any votes cast for Cain to be in direct <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own possible candidacy.|$|E
5|$|William {{excluded}} George {{from active}} military service, and neither George nor Anne wielded any great influence {{until after the}} deaths of Mary and then William, at which point Anne became queen. During his wife's reign, George occasionally used his influence in <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wife, even when privately disagreeing with her views. He had an easy-going manner and little interest in politics; his appointment as Lord High Admiral in 1702 was largely honorary.|$|E
50|$|In 1316 Władysław {{entered into}} an {{agreement}} with Florian, Bishop of Płock) concerning with the payment of tithes, {{and in this way}} the excommunication imposed to his family since 1310 was removed.

5|$|A strong {{influence}} on Champagne wine production was the centuries-old rivalry between {{the region and}} Burgundy. From the key market of Paris to the palace of Louis XIV of France at Versailles, proponents of Champagne and Burgundy would compete for dominance. For most of his life, Louis XIV would drink only Champagne wine with the <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> doctor Antoine d'Aquin who advocated the King drink Champagne with every meal {{for the benefit of}} his health. As the King aged and his ailments increased, competing doctors would propose alternative treatments with alternative wines, to soothe the King's ills. One of these doctors, Guy-Crescent Fagon conspired with the King's mistress to oust d'Aquin and have himself appointed as Royal Doctor. Fagon quickly attributed the King's continuing ailments to Champagne and ordered that only Burgundy wine must be served at the royal table.|$|E
5|$|A weary emperor who {{no longer}} cared for the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, discontent among ruling circles who were dismissive of the Imperial role in {{national}} affairs: all seemed to presage the monarchy's impending doom. Nevertheless, Pedro II was unconcerned that times and conditions were changing. After more than five decades on the throne, he had become complacent in a belief that the devotion and <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> subjects was immutable. Because of these factors, and the lack of an energetic response on the part of Pedro II, {{it has been argued that}} prime responsibility for the monarchy's overthrow rested with the Emperor himself.|$|E
5|$|As Mary was {{an infant}} when she {{inherited}} the throne, Scotland was ruled by regents until she became an adult. From the outset, there were two claims to the Regency: one from Catholic Cardinal Beaton, and the other from the Protestant Earl of Arran, who was next in line to the throne. Beaton's claim {{was based on a}} version of the late king's will that his opponents dismissed as a forgery. Arran, with the <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> friends and relations, became the regent until 1554 when Mary's mother managed to remove and succeed him.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the Old Court – New Court controversy, Kentucky's {{politicians}} became divided between the Democrats and the National Republicans. Crittenden's alliance with Henry Clay and his own personal political views put him squarely in the National Republican Party. Because of Crittenden's <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> presidential bid, President Adams appointed him United States district attorney for the district of Kentucky in 1827. In 1828, Adams nominated him to replace Kentuckian Robert Trimble as an associate justice of the Supreme Court, but Jackson supporters in the Senate refused to confirm him. When Jackson defeated Adams in the 1828 presidential election, he removed Crittenden from his post as district attorney because of his association with Clay and his opposition to Jackson's financial policies.|$|E
5|$|Australia's {{leadership}} changed {{again during}} the Borneo Campaign. Prime Minister Curtin {{suffered a heart attack}} in November 1944 and Deputy Prime Minister Frank Forde acted in his place until 22 January 1945. Curtin was hospitalised with another bout of illness in April 1945 and Treasurer Ben Chifley became acting Prime Minister as Forde was attending the San Francisco Conference. Curtin died on 5 July 1945 and Forde was sworn in as Prime Minister. Forde did not have the <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> party, however, and was replaced by Chifley after a leadership ballot was held on 13 July.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the return}} of Shackleton's body to South Georgia, there was a {{memorial}} service held for him with full military honours at Holy Trinity Church, Montevideo, and on 2 March a service was held at St Paul's Cathedral, London, at which the King {{and other members of}} the royal family were represented. Within a year the first biography, The Life of Sir Ernest Shackleton, by Hugh Robert Mill, was published. This book, as well as being a tribute to the explorer, was a practical effort to assist his family; Shackleton died some £40,000 in debt (2011: £1.6 million). A further initiative was the establishment of a Shackleton Memorial Fund, which was used to assist the education of his children and the <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mother.|$|E

2500|$|Many castles were feudal estates {{that were}} {{owned by a}} {{powerful}} feudal lord or prince-bishopric. Princely territories at that time were protected by a dense network of small and medium-sized fortifications, which was supplemented by the fortified estates of sub-vassals. From this perspective, {{in the event of}} attack the defenders could rely entirely on the <b>support</b> <b>of</b> their lords <b>his</b> subordinated or allied knighthood. Conversely the ruler would of course rely on the <b>support</b> [...] <b>of</b> <b>his</b> vassals in time of conflict.|$|R

A live version filmed on 11 December at the Shepherds Bush Empire, west London, {{appeared}} on the concert DVD Far East Man (2002). Among Wood's band were his son Jessie (on guitar) and daughter Leah (vocals), the latter being Wood's eldest child by his second wife, Jo Karslake.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th century English chivalric {{ideas of}} selfless {{service to the}} king had been corrupted. Armed forces were mostly raised through musters in {{individual}} estates; every able-bodied man had to respond to his lord's call to arms, and each noble had exclusive authority over his militia. Although a king could raise personal militia from his lands, he could only muster a significantly large army through the <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> nobles. Richard, like his predecessors, had to win over these men by granting gifts and maintaining cordial relationships. Powerful nobles could demand greater incentives {{to remain on the}} liege's side or else they might turn against him. Three groups, each with its own agenda, stood on Bosworth Field: Richard III and his Yorkist army; his challenger, Henry Tudor, who championed the Lancastrian cause; and the fence-sitting Stanleys.|$|E
5|$|Due to the lord's {{presence}} in a castle, it was a centre of administration from where he controlled his lands. He relied on the support of those below him, as without the <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> more powerful tenants a lord could expect his power to be undermined. Successful lords regularly held court with those immediately below them on the social scale, but absentees could expect to find their influence weakened. Larger lordships could be vast, {{and it would be}} impractical for a lord to visit all his properties regularly so deputies were appointed. This especially applied to royalty, who sometimes owned land in different countries.|$|E

5|$|Henry's {{ability to}} govern was intimately {{bound up with}} the Church, which formed the key to the {{administration}} of both England and Normandy, and this relationship changed considerably {{over the course of his}} reign. William the Conqueror had reformed the English Church with the <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Archbishop of Canterbury, Lanfranc, who became a close colleague and advisor to the King. Under William Rufus this arrangement had collapsed, the King and Archbishop Anselm had become estranged and Anselm had gone into exile. Henry also believed in Church reform, but on taking power in England he became embroiled in the investiture controversy.|$|E
5|$|In 371, the Emperor Valens split Cappadocia {{into two}} new provinces, Cappadocia Prima and Cappadocia Secunda. This {{resulted}} in complex changes in ecclesiastical boundaries, during which several new bishoprics were created. Gregory was elected {{bishop of the}} new see of Nyssa in 372, presumably with the <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brother Basil, who was metropolitan of Caesarea. Gregory's early policies as bishop often went against those of Basil : for instance, while his brother condemned the Sabellianist followers of Marcellus of Ancyra as heretics, Gregory may have tried to reconcile them with the church.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} campaign he faced Republican nominee Sean Bielat, a technology executive {{and member of the}} U.S. Marine Corps Reserve. Bielat had run an unsuccessful campaign against Barney Frank in the 2010 election for the 4th district seat. In a series of debates, Bielat challenged Kennedy's qualifications for Congress, saying that the Democrat's campaign was coasting on name recognition rather than experience, and that he would be a party-line vote. Kennedy tried to tie Bielat to the budget platform of U.S. Representative Paul Ryan, although Bielat responded that he only supported parts of the plan. Kennedy raised over $4 million in <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> campaign, far exceeding Bielat's draw of around $900,000. Kennedy won the November 6 election with 61 percent of the vote to Bielat's 36 percent.|$|E
50|$|In 1866, he {{was elected}} to the first of two {{four-year}} terms in the state senate, having won critical African American <b>support</b> because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> having championed their causes and befriended individual freedmen.|$|R
