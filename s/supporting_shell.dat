Quantitative measurements of the pearling instability give a square-root behavior for the wavelength {{as a function of}} drug concentration.

40|$|Actin {{filament}} networks play {{an active}} role in cytokinesis of eukaryotic cells. These networks, linked mainly by myosin, are concentrated below the cell membrane forming a spherical <b>supporting</b> <b>shell.</b> During cytokinesis, this network is modified such that a contractile ring is formed along the diameter of the shell. We present a realistic three-dimensional simulation model to study the dynamics of this spherical shell of elastic actin filaments and myosin motors. The results show compelling evidence that this fibre-spring model, with the motors activated in a narrow region around the division plane, is sufficient to reproduce most of the essential mechanics of cytokinesis: A spontaneous formation of a contractile ring, a characteristic filament orientation structure, and realistic cleavage furrow dynamics. These results demonstrate that, though cytokinesis is a highly complex process with large variation in intricate details, the fundamental dynamics are largely generic. In particular, motor mediated contraction of an unstructured filament mesh is sufficient to undergo division without concentrated and directed polymerization in the cleavage zone...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{thin wall}} beam theory for the {{analysis}} of simply <b>supported</b> <b>shells</b> is described and the necessary modifications to the thin wall beam theory are shown which will make the solution as theoretically correct as the basic classical theories used in the analysis of simply <b>supported</b> <b>shells.</b> A simply <b>supported</b> circular cylindrical <b>shell</b> is analyzed by this method and the results compared with a solution by the classical theory for the same shell which is given in the American Society of Civil Engineers Manual No. 31. The results show close agreement. The analysis is similar to the method of analysis of H. Lundgren. Either a successive corrections methods as used by Lundgren, or a successive approximations procedure, developed in this thesis, may be used. Slow convergence, or even divergence, is obtained in many problems. However, very rapid convergence may be obtained by the use of extrapolation formulas based upon the assumption that in successive cycles the differences between the true solution and the trial solution decrease, or increase, in a geometric ratio. The basic purpose for presenting the "mOdified thin wall beam theory" is not just to simplify the analysis of thin shells {{from the standpoint of the}} mathematics involved, but rather to provide an addi-tional method to use in the analysis of shells in cases where the goy-, erning differential equations cannot be solved exactly or even be de- fined in explicit mathematical terms...|$|R

Taking advantage of the ingestion of 500 ml of transparent liquid by the patient, an effective distension of the stomach is safely achieved for a timeframe of approximately 30 minutes.

The capsule is 15 mm in diameter and 30 mm in length, and it is composed of a <b>supporting</b> <b>shell</b> containing a wireless microcontroller, a battery and four motors.

This reduction in the actual standing crop of oyster is mainly the result of: 1. The low prolonged salinity and the sediment causes mass mortality on oyster population; 2. Deterioration of the quality and available amounts of <b>supporting</b> <b>shell</b> substratum, required by oyster seedling attach and growth until they reach comercial size. Se cuantificó la oferta potencial de la ostra Crassostrea rhizophorae (Guíldíng, 1828) en 938, 6 toneladas de carne/año (peso húmedo) para ostras con talla comercial en la zona norte de la Ciénaga Grande de Santa Marta. Se estimó que el área de los bancos en esta zona es de 3. 000. 000 metros cuadrados. La oferta real de ostra en el periodo de estudio (abril-noviembre de 1982) fue de 3, 9 toneladas carne (pesohúmedo) y se estimó que se cosecharon aproximadamente 2, 0 toneladas carne (peso húmedo). Esta variación en la oferta natural de ostra se debe principalmente a: 1. Baja prolongada de la salinidad que junto con la sedimentación ocasiona la mortalidad masiva de las poblaciones deostras; 2.

40|$|With {{the aid of}} Chalmers {{specimens}} {{according to}} DIN ISO 4368, part 2, the bonding strength between Babbit sliding bearing materials and steel support members was investigated. The experimental results proved that the bonding strength of the newly developed alloy Sn- 12 Sb- 6 Cu- 1. 8 Bi remained insufficient, when the <b>supporting</b> <b>shell</b> of steel grade C 10 was dipped in a pure Sn bath, even with variations of Sn bath temperature or casting and cooling modifications. With Bi containing melts an oxide layer forms between steel and bearing metal when the alloy is poured into the tin coated cups requested for Chalmers specimens. This oxide layer prevents a proper Fe/Sn bonding. The reason {{for the formation of}} the oxide layer when using Bi containing melts is not understood. A possible solution to the bonding problem is the in situ formation of a new bond coating directly from a modified tin bath. To this end, the bath of pure tin is alloyed with an element which has a higher affinity to iron than tin does. One possible alloying element is Zn, which can form intermetallic Fe-Zn layers on the steel shell enabling higher bonding strengths than layers formed in pure tin baths. By modifying the tinning of steel support shells this way, the originally low bonding strength of the newly developed bearing alloy could be increased to the level of conventional tin based sliding bearing alloys. In addition, the bonding strength of conventional Babbit metals on tin base could be considerably increased. The modified Sn Zn bath yields high bonding strengths with the investigated new alloys Sn- 12 Sb- 6 Cu- 1. 8 Bi, Sn- 12 Sb- 6 Cu- 1. 8 B+Te 5, Sn- 12 Sb- 6 Cu- 1. 8 B+Ni 5, Sn- 12 Sb- 6 Cu- 1. 8 Bi+Zn 50 {{as well as with the}} conventional Babbit alloys TEGO V 738, TEGOSTAR and TEGOTENAX. With the lead based alloy LM-THERMIT an improvement is not achieved, yet, the bonding strength surpasses under all testing conditions a value of 50 N/mm 2. This proves that the new bath is universally applicable. To test the alloy dependence of the bonding strength the Zn content was varied from 9 over 24, 50 and 60 to 70 weight - %. Depending on ZN content the bath temperature was raised from 280 to 380 °C. On an average, the Zn content of 50 % gave the most favorable strength values. As a bath temperature, 360 °C turned out to deliver the best results...|$|E
40|$|Tunnel {{excavation}} {{produces a}} re-distribution of stresses {{in the rock}} and a tendency for closure of the void produced – a tendency counteracted by the tunnel <b>support</b> <b>shell.</b> In some tunnels a very stiff <b>support</b> <b>shell</b> not permitting any ground deformation is selected. In other tunnels, excavated {{on the basis of}} the popular so-called “NATM ” a quite different approach is adopted: A controlled deformation of the ground is permitted (i. e. limited closure of the rate of approximately 1 %) and this gives the opportunity to the stresses to be partly released and a less stiff and less-expensive support system to be used. In this case, an accurate, systematic and continuous monitoring of the tunnel deformation is absolutely necessary during the excavation. In the last years, the introduction of modern total station instruments provided a simple, low cost and functional way to record the absolute 3 -D displacements of a large number of controlled points (usually 3 - 5 points every approximately 10 - 20 m). Such data from a number of tunnels were used to study: i) the distribution of deformation in the various tunnel sections, ii) the variation of maximum section closure along the tunnel axis, iii) the time-history of deformation and iv) the relationship between closures and ring closure delays. 1...|$|R

The knowledge base will be developed through initial sieving and organization of data from the database. The decision <b>support</b> <b>shell</b> would provide decision support through a structured process consisting of building the hierarchy between the main criteria and the suggested controls, rating the controls, and analyzing the controls for selection through multiple analytical techniques.

This would eventually lead the decision maker to the suggested controls for variations and assist in selecting the most appropriate controls. The KBDSS would assist project managers by providing accurate and timely information for decision-making, and a user-friendly system for analyzing and selecting the controls for variation orders for institutional buildings.
