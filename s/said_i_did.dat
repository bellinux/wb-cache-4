25|$|I {{wrote in}} {{detail about the}} Holocaust and <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not want to discuss numbers. I quoted an {{argument}} between historians in which various numbers of casualties were mentioned. One wrote there were 12million victims and another wrote there were 800,000. I {{have no desire to}} argue with the figures. The Holocaust was a terrible, unforgivable crime against the Jewish nation, a crime against humanity that cannot be accepted by humankind. The Holocaust was a terrible thing and nobody can claim I denied it.|$|E

I have had no claims to make, only that I am instructed that I am the Lord's messenger... Early in my youth I was asked several times, Are you a prophet? I have ever responded, I am the Lord's messenger. I know that many have called me a prophet, but I have made no claim to this title." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 12, 2007, President Bush held a {{press conference}} and was asked about his {{commutation}} of Libby's prison sentence. Bush told reporters: First of all, the Scooter Libby decision was, I thought, a fair and balanced decision. Secondly, I haven't {{spent a lot of time}} talking about the testimony that people throughout my administration were forced to give as a result of the special prosecutor. I didn't ask them during the time and I haven't asked them since. I'm aware of the fact that perhaps somebody in the administration did disclose the name of that person, and I've often thought about what would have happened had that person come forth and <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it. Would we have had this, you know, endless hours of investigation and a lot of money being spent on this matter? But it's been a tough issue for a lot of people in the White House, and it's run its course and now we're going to move on." ...|$|E

60|$|What next {{might have}} been <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know, for just then we were {{interrupted}} by a visit from our common banker, and the discourse was necessarily changed.|$|R
60|$|I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know, but {{hoped it}} might be the next-door dog.|$|E
60|$|I did {{not like}} to hear our race called sheep, and <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not think they were.|$|E
60|$|I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> and {{proceeded}} to hint {{that it would be}} advisable for him to go below now and take a rest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{have you}} been so kind to him?" [...] she asked timidly. [...] "From what he <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{think that he was}} very useful to you, and, indeed, you and he are so different." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{you do not}} understand," [...] she answered, {{smiling at}} him. [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not wish to be}} forgotten. Only--just at that moment, it sounded natural enough--and today--I think that I am a little ashamed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Chettam is {{a little}} hasty, my dear," [...] said Mr. Brooke, {{coloring}} slightly; [...] "a little hasty, you know. <b>I</b> never <b>said</b> <b>I</b> should <b>do</b> anything of the kind. <b>I</b> never <b>said</b> <b>I</b> should not <b>do</b> it, you know." ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know, but {{we could}} try a dog and see. So he sent out an aide-de-camp to give the order to add the dog.|$|E
6000|$|... "What could I say? Of course I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know. I {{suppose he}} was meditating whether you would live here {{and ask him}} to dinner on Sundays!" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{explained}} my situation, but <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not doubt}} {{but the two}} ships would gradually drift together. [...] "Is there no one to lower your boat?" [...] I asked.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Mary (to SANDY, hurriedly and excitedly). You {{have heard}} what that woman <b>said.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not ask you under what alias you are known here: I only ask a single question.--Is SHE your wife? {{are you the}} father of her child? ...|$|R
6000|$|As <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{understand}} German, but Mrs. Colesworthy knows the language well, and, {{stepping up to}} the man, she said (she afterward told me {{the meaning of the}} words that passed between them): [...] "Are you Dr. Hildstein?" ...|$|R
60|$|Bun. <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> Because <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not find}} it {{commanded}} in the Word of God.|$|R
60|$|I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not see how}} a {{blind man}} could be a guide: but at that he laughed aloud, and said his stick was eyes enough for an eagle.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was very}} dull, {{and there was}} nothing more to be <b>said.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> come away early, and perhaps have given affront. I hope you will accept the {{compliment}} implied." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You were {{speaking}} of her," [...] I {{said to the}} boy, who was half-sitting, half-crouching {{against the side of}} the tunnel. [...] "What was it you <b>said?</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not hear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I understand, Sir John; but, as <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not think}} {{we should all be}} told until the blow is ready to be struck, as they would be afraid that some one might inform against them, if time and {{opportunity}} were granted them." ...|$|R
60|$|Where {{are those}} brutes, your enemies, <b>said</b> <b>I,</b> <b>do</b> {{you know where}} they are gone? There they lye, sir, said he, {{pointing}} to a thicket of trees; my heart trembles, for fear they have seen us, and heard you speak, if they have, they will certainly murther us all.|$|R
5000|$|Some of Rainey's lyrics contain {{references}} to lesbianism or bisexuality, {{such as the}} 1928 song [...] "Prove It on Me":They <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> it, ain't nobody caught me.Sure got to prove it on me.Went out last night with a crowd of my friends.They must've been women, 'cause I don't like no men.|$|R
6000|$|Why {{this was}} <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not understand; but Rupert laughed at it, {{as if it}} were a capital thing. To mend the matter, he added, a little boisterously for him-- ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But I {{have not}} the {{slightest}} idea of {{falling in love with}} him. In spite of what <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> hope that <b>I</b> can help it. And then I feel to him just as though he were my brother. I've got almost to know what it would be to have a brother." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have been}} led to say these few words, not at all from a desire to {{supplement}} my father's biography of himself, but to mention the main incidents in his life after he had finished his own record. In what <b>I</b> have here <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think <b>I</b> have exceeded his instructions.|$|R
60|$|Bun. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{desire to}} demean {{myself in the}} world, both as becometh {{a man and a}} Christian.|$|R
6000|$|Something {{gleamed in}} the shadow of the nearer bungalow, and a man's voice {{answered}} from within. What he <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not catch, but suddenly I heard Nettie calling very distinctly, [...] "We've been bathing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly! I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not understand." [...] The {{feeling of}} having scored a point made Derek {{feel a little}} better. [...] "I admit it. Your {{behaviour}} is incomprehensible. Where did you meet this fellow?" ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not understand, and he {{said what}} he wanted was my true name, for he guessed I picked up this one since I stole my last chickens. They all laughed loudly at that.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> never <b>said</b> <b>I</b> was, <b>did</b> <b>I?</b> And Friday ain't all, neither. I had {{a rotten}} bad dream last night--dreampt about rats." ...|$|R
