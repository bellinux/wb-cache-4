40|$|We have {{assembled}} a homogeneous database of 417 ultraviolet (UV) extinction curves for reddened <b>sightlines</b> having International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) spectra. We have combined these with optical and 2 MASS photometry allowing {{estimates of the}} ratio of total-to-selective extinction, R(V), for the entire sample. Fitzpatrick-Massa (FM) parameters have also been found for the entire sample. This is the largest study of parameterized UV extinction curves yet published and it covers {{a wide range of}} environments, from dense molecular clouds to the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM), with extinctions A(V) ranging from 0. 50 to 4. 80. It is the first to extend far beyond the solar neighborhood and into the Galaxy at large, with 30 <b>sightlines</b> having distances > 5 kpc. Previously, the longest <b>sightlines</b> with FM parameters and R(V) extended ~ 1 kpc. We find that (1.) the CCM extinction law applies for 93 % of the <b>sightlines,</b> implying that dust processing in the Galaxy is efficient and systematic; (2.) the central wavelength of the 2175 A bump is constant; (3.) the 2175 A bump width is dependent on environment. Only four <b>sightlines</b> show systematic deviations from CCM, HD 29647, 62542, 204827, and 210121. These <b>sightlines</b> all sample dense, molecule-rich clouds. The new extinction curves and values of R(V) allow us to revise the CCM law. Comment: 32 pages, 12 figure...|$|R

2500|$|Subsequent {{observations}} of the [...] "H" [...] and [...] "K" [...] lines of calcium by [...] revealed double and asymmetric profiles in the spectra of Epsilon and Zeta Orionis. These were the first steps {{in the study of}} the very complex interstellar <b>sightline</b> towards Orion. Asymmetric absorption line profiles are the result of the superposition of multiple absorption lines, each corresponding to the same atomic transition (for example the [...] "K" [...] line of calcium), but occurring in interstellar clouds with different radial velocities. Because each cloud has a different velocity (either towards or away from the observer/Earth) the absorption lines occurring within each cloud are either Blue-shifted or Red-shifted (respectively) from the lines' rest wavelength, through the Doppler Effect. These observations confirming that matter is not distributed homogeneously were the first evidence of multiple discrete clouds within the ISM.|$|E
2500|$|Referee Hansson told Sveriges Radio Blekinge [...] "I cannot {{comment on}} the game itself but life must go on. I will ride this storm as well". In his first {{substantial}} {{comment on the}} incident, Hansson spoke to the regional Swedish newspaper [...] on 24 November. While repeating the fact that FIFA rules prevented him commenting on the game until the investigation concluded, he said the incident was neither his or his referee team's fault. Referring to a graphic illustration printed earlier in The Times and reproduced in some Swedish newspapers, he said [...] " [...] clears the whole refereeing team in this incident". The picture, titled 'Why the referee missed it', purported to show how neither the referee or the assistant referee could have seen the handball incident, due {{to the presence of}} three Irish players blocking Hansson's view from his position {{on the edge of the}} penalty area, and Irish goalkeeper Shay Given's position obscuring the <b>sightline</b> of the assistant referee, Nilsson, who was standing on the right hand touchline. He also stated that the reaction to the game had made him consider quitting his job as a referee.

2500|$|As the {{traverse}} of {{the main}} gun was limited, it had first to be pointed {{in the general direction}} of the target by the driver-commander swivelling the entire vehicle. To facilitate this, a small rectangular frame is fitted on the right side of the nose of the tank. Looking through it, the driver had a <b>sightline</b> parallel to that of the cannon in a neutral position. In practice, the commander had a too limited view of his surroundings through the small hatches to his left, front and right and had to resort to lifting his head out of his rectangular top hatch to observe the enemy. [...] Small rectangular hatches, fitted with a vision slit, are further present to the front of each machine-gun. The main ventilation is provided by a large skylight slit running along the midline of the hull. [...] It is doubly roofed with the lower roof having a second slit in its top, while the higher roof has open lower sides, creating oblique oblong ventilation channels through which fresh air can be sucked in from the outside. The top roof is the highest element of the vehicle. [...] With later production vehicles, polluted air is removed through a broad ventilation grid in the nose, having a recessed armour plate below it. To the left and the right of the skylight roof rectangular escape hatches are present in the hull top.|$|E

40|$|Modeling {{extinction}} along anomalous/non-CCM <b>sightlines,</b> {{which are}} characterized by a broad $ 217. 5 nm$ bump and steep far-ultraviolet (FUV) rise, is reported. The extinction along these <b>sightlines,</b> viz. {HD 210121 }, {HD 204827 }, {HD 29647 } and {HD 62542 }, is difficult to reproduce using standard silicate and graphite grains. Very good match with the observed extinction is obtained by considering nanodiamond component as part of carbonaceous matter. Most of these <b>sightlines</b> are rich in carbon and are invariably backed by a young hot stellar object. Nanodiamond is taken as core within amorphous carbon and graphite. These core-mantle particles taken as additional components along with graphite and silicates lead to reduction in the silicate requirement. The abundance of carbonaceous matter is not affected as a very small fraction of nanodiamond is required. Extinction along <b>sightlines</b> that show steep FUV is also reported demonstrating the importance of nanodiamond component in all such regions. Comment: 16 pages, 2 Tables and 3 Figure...|$|R

40|$|We employ CaII K and NaI D {{interstellar}} absorption-line spectroscopy of early-type {{stars in}} the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds to investigate the large- and small-scale structure in foreground Intermediate and High Velocity Clouds (I/HVCs). These data include FLAMES-GIRAFFE CaII K observations of 403 stars in four open clusters, plus FEROS or UVES spectra of 156 {{stars in the}} LMC and SMC. The FLAMES observations are amongst the most extensive probes to date of CaII structures on 20 arcsec scales From the FLAMES data within a 0. 5 degree field-of-view, the CaII K equivalent width in the I/HVC components towards three clusters varies by factors of > 10. There are no detections of molecular gas in absorption at intermediate or high velocities, although molecular absorption is present at LMC and Galactic velocities towards some <b>sightlines.</b> The <b>sightlines</b> show variations in EW exceeding a factor 7 in CH+ towards NGC 1761 over scales of less than 10 arcminutes. The FEROS/UVES data show CaII K I/HVC absorption in ∼ 60 per cent of <b>sightlines.</b> No NaI D is found at non-Magellanic HVC velocities aside from a tentative detection towards the star LHA 120 -S 93. The range in the CaII/NaI ratio in I/HVCs is from - 0. 45 to + 1. 5 dex, similar to previous measurements for I/HVCs. In ten <b>sightlines</b> we find CaII/OI ratios in I/HVC gas ranging from 0. 2 to 1. 5 dex below the solar value, indicating either dust or ionisation effects.

40|$|Abstract. The Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) has {{observed}} over three hundred fifty <b>sightlines</b> to extragalactic targets. About one hundred fifty {{of these are}} of sufficient quality to measure O VI absorption in and near the Milky Way. High-velocity O VI absorption is detected in about 80 % of the <b>sightlines,</b> with the detection rate going up for <b>sightlines</b> with higher signal-tonoise ratios. O VI is almost always seen in directions with previously known H I HVCs, including HVCs complex C, complex A, complex WD, the Magellanic Stream, and the Outer Arm. Studies of several <b>sightlines</b> through complex C suggest that the O VI absorption is produced in conductive interfaces between the cool HVC and a hotter surrounding medium, most likely a corona around the Milky Way. The O VI detections associated with the Magellanic Stream imply that this hot corona has a radius of at least 50 kpc. About half of the detections of high-velocity O VI are in directions where no high-velocity H I was previously known. Some of these are probably associated with the Magellanic Stream, others may represent Local Group gas. Still others often show up a...|$|R

40|$|We present new {{measurements}} of the oxygen gas-phase abundance along four <b>sightlines</b> probing gas inside the Local Bubble, using data obtained with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) and the Hubble Space Telecope (HST). Combining these with seven previously published N(O I) and N(H I) measurements we determine a mean O/H ratio for the Local Bubble, (O/H) = (3. 45 +/- 0. 19) x 10 ^(- 4) (1 sigma in the mean). Our result is virtually identical to O/H = (3. 43 +/- 0. 15) x 10 ^(- 4) derived from data for <b>sightlines</b> probing gas well outside the Local Bubble. In contrast to the D/O and D/H ratios, which seem to have different values beyond the Local Bubble, our {{results show that the}} O/H ratio is constant and single-valued {{both inside and outside the}} Local Bubble, for low density <b>sightlines,</b> with column densities up to log N (H) ~ 21. In addition, the similarity of the two values above suggests that the net effect of the uncertain O I f-values in the FUSE bandpass is not significant. Taking into account the latest determinations of the Solar abundance of oxygen, our result implies that ~ 25 % of the oxygen in the Local Bubble is depleted onto dust grains. The similarity of the value for O/H along low average density <b>sightlines</b> in the Local Bubble with that of denser <b>sightlines</b> beyond may permit a limit on the diluting effects of infalling low metallicity gas.
