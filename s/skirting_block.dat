The growing {{power of}} computing, development of methods of 3 D graphics for human body {{modeling and simulation}} together with development of 3 D image capture technologies using 3 D scanners has caused rapid development of digital tailoring- a complex of methods where made-to-measure clothing is produced starting with 3 D scanning of a customer, extraction of essential measurements from obtained data cloud and then automatic production of a garment corresponding to exact measures of the customer. Extraction of exact measures from the ca 200000 data points produced by 3 D scanner is a complex problem and not yet well investigated...|$|R

50|$|The main {{structural}} {{components of}} the engine are all manufactured from aluminum alloy. The engine is built around a very stiff, lightweight, enclosed V, deep <b>skirt</b> cylinder <b>block.</b> A structural windage tray is bolted {{to the bottom of}} the cylinder block to further improve the block stiffness, minimize NVH (noise, vibration and harshness) and help reduce oil foaming. To further enhance the stiffness of the lower engine structure, a heavily ribbed sump body is installed. The sump body also helps to reduce engine noise.|$|R

50|$|The first Chevrolet {{engine to}} use 4-bolt mains was the 1967 Chevrolet Camaro. Chrysler and Ford {{employed}} Y-blocks, {{meaning that the}} <b>block</b> <b>skirts</b> extended below the centreline of the crankshaft.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a combined field, laboratory, and numerical study of electromagnetic borehole flowmeter measurements acquired {{without the use}} of a packer or <b>skirt</b> to <b>block</b> bypass flow around the flowmeter. The most significant finding is that inflow through the wellbore screen changes the ratio of flow through the flowmeter to wellbore flow. Experiments reveal up to a factor of two differences in this ratio for conditions with and without inflow through the wellbore screen. Standard practice is to assume the ratio is constant. A numerical model has been developed to simulate the effect of inflow on the flowmeter. The model is formulated using momentum conservation within the borehole and around the flowmeter. The model is embedded in the MODFLOW- 2000 ground water flow code...|$|R
6000|$|Tom <b>skirted</b> the <b>block,</b> {{and came}} round into a muddy alley that {{led by the}} back of his aunt's cow-stable. He {{presently}} got safely beyond the reach of capture and punishment, and hastened toward the public square of the village, where two [...] "military" [...] companies of boys had met for conflict, according to previous appointment. Tom was General of one of these armies, Joe Harper (a bosom friend) General of the other. These two great commanders did not condescend to fight in person--that being better suited to the still smaller fry--but sat together on an eminence and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through aides-de-camp. Tom's army won a great victory, after a long and hard-fought battle. Then the dead were counted, prisoners exchanged, the terms of the next disagreement agreed upon, and the day for the necessary battle appointed; after which the armies fell into line and marched away, and Tom turned homeward alone.|$|R
5000|$|The Super Duty was {{introduced}} in 1958, {{the same year as}} the FE and MEL series V8 engines, as a replacement for the Lincoln Y-block in truck applications. The Super Duty was available in displacements of 401, 477 and 534 cubic inches (6.6L, 7.8L and 8.8L). These engines were large, heavy, high torque engines and operated at a relatively low RPM. They were never designed as automobile engines and were commonly found in large, industrial use vehicles including dump trucks, garbage trucks, concrete mixing trucks, large buses and other medium and heavy duty trucks of the time. The Super Duty engine was built in Ford's Cleveland engine plant number 2. They had a unique intake system where the intake dumped into the head and all four cylinders pulled the mixture out of a log type port in the head. They could spit when cold and blow the choke plate out into the air cleaner because of the large port configuration. In later engines this was corrected; they had a spider type intake more modern style. The exhaust valves were sodium filled that when hot it liquefied and carried heat away from the valve head and took it to the valve spring that dispensed heat into the oil coming off the rocker arm which is the reason for a water to oil cooler. The piston assembly weighed three times more than other gas engine manufactures. The block was unique in that it was a 90 degree v 8 but the top deck was 60 degrees. The head was flat on the combustion chamber side so by doing this they achieved a wedge combustion chamber. With this design it left a big hole so they put a large pop top piston to try to displace some volume. They used a deep <b>skirted</b> <b>block</b> for strength. They governed these at about 3400 rpm due to their great rotating mass. When ford built the 385 series engine and started to change over a 460 or 429 weighed about half of the 477. The 401,477,534 engines also had 4 radiator hoses, when you ordered they would ask if you needed the( [...] lower lower,upper lower,lower upper or the upper upper which was amusing to do to new parts guys. Under full load they would run 2 miles on a gallon of gas. With correct maintenance they would give 500,000 miles between rebuilds ...|$|R
25|$|While the Japanese {{began moving}} into {{position}} north of Mission Ridge {{in preparation for}} the main attack, Allied aircraft carried out an air raid at Kagi on 6/7 September, killing two and wounding another two. The following day, a force eight US B-26 Marauders, escorted by four P-40 Kittyhawks, carried out a larger airstrike in support of the Australian ground troops on the track, killing 11 Japanese and wounding another 20. The assault began with a heavy artillery barrage on the 2/27th's positions on 7 September. Under this, the III Battalion, 144th Infantry Regiment, attacked straight up the track and although the assault was held by the defenders from the 2/27th, the Japanese succeeded in partially enveloping the forward Australian battalion. As the Australians were distracted, under the cover of darkness the II Battalion, 144th Infantry Regiment carried out a flanking move to the west towards the Fagume River {{with the help of a}} Papuan guide who helped them rejoin the main track once they had <b>skirted</b> the <b>blocking</b> positions established by the Australians, coming in behind the rear Australian battalion, the 2/16th, effectively cutting off the infantry battalions from their headquarters element. At this time, the Japanese artillery firing from the north switched targets to the 2/16th's positions.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the vibration history of the engine block and predict its surface vibration status, a FEM model on 4102 BZQ Diesel Engine block was constructed. Based on the cylinder pressure curve of 4102 BZQ, some important exciting forces applied on the block were calculated. ANSYS software was used to compute and analyze dynamic response of the block. Simultaneously the node displacement history of the block model was obtained. The results of calculation and analysis showed that the vibration of the <b>block</b> <b>skirts</b> was more intense and the skirt was the main factor to influence {{the reliability of the}} engine. Cylinder head bolt force and piston slap force had significant effect on the top area of the block, and the surface vibration of the skirt was strongly influenced by the crank shaft load...|$|R
60|$|Her short <b>skirt</b> did not <b>block</b> {{the free}} {{movement}} of her limbs, and she discovered with pleasurable surprise that the quick tripping step of the city pavement had departed from her, {{and that she was}} swinging off in the long easy stride which is born of the trail and which comes only after much travail and endeavor. More than one gold-rusher, shooting keen glances at her ankles and gray-gaitered calves, affirmed Del Bishop's judgment. And more than one glanced up at her face, and glanced again; for her gaze was frank, with the frankness of comradeship; and in her eyes there was always a smiling light, just trembling on the verge of dawn; and did the onlooker smile, her eyes smiled also. And the smiling light was protean-mooded,--merry, sympathetic, joyous, quizzical,--the complement of whatsoever kindled it. And sometimes the light spread over all her face, till the smile prefigured by it was realized. But it was always in frank and open comradeship.|$|R
40|$|Creating custom {{clothing}} manually is a labor-intensive process. 7 hree-dimensional (3 D) body scan-ning {{technology can}} provide the means to automatically create custom-fitted patterns, but methods are needed. A processfor developing a basic <b>block</b> <b>skirt</b> pattern from body scans was developed. A mathematical conceptfor describing the human body in two dimensions was explored using all rel-evant surface 3 D data. Using this method, prototype patterns were generated directlyfrom the scan data of ive participants and tested in afit test. The participants felt that the prototype skirtsfit their bodies well. M ost women's clothing is ready-to-wear, i. e., clothing designed for a prototype body identified by the designer as the target market body type. Standard grading then creates a range of sizes based on this one body type. Most clothing is designed for Caucasian body types, with sizing categories proportioned for subsets (Juniors, Misses, Petites, etc.). Since there is great variation in body types, this method has not succeeded in providing well-fitting ready-to-wear (rtw) for much ofthe population. Studies indicate that about 50 % ofyounger women and up to 70 % of older American women are dissatisfied with the fit of their clothing (DesMarteau, 2000; Goldsberry, Shim & Reich, 1996). Good fit is frequently cited {{as one of the}} most desired attributes of clothing. Clearly, an improved method for providing good fit for all women is needed...|$|R
5000|$|Gujarat {{is renowned}} for its textile {{production}} methods. Bordering Rajasthan, the two states share similarities in culture and identity. The ancient Indus Valley Civilization inhabited the entire region, including Rajasthan and Punjab during Medieval India. [...] They embarked on this textile industry in Gujarat. Within textile production, each caste is assigned to an occupation of its own. These are, weaving, dyeing and printing. For example, the Salvi caste is assigned to weaving. Garment producers bring these elements together to form the identity of Gujarati textiles. Direct application is a method also symbolic to Gujarati garments. Paint and other applicants are used to form patterns on fabric for dupattas, ghagras (long <b>skirt)</b> and turbans. <b>Block</b> printing is a widely used form of direct application. In Bandhani, a unique Gujarati craft, fabric is tied at different sections before dyeing to create patterns. [...] This foundation of forming patterns through dyeing has emerged from the rural communities of this state. Along with the complete image of a Gujarati woman are large bangles made of ivory and plastic, these are symbols of a married woman. Conch shell and shellac bangles are the most common. Conch shell bangles are plain white with a light shade of a brighter colour where as shellac bangles are shaped as a shell, painted and decorated with glitter. [...] These have in recent years become an accessory in both domestic and international markets..|$|R
