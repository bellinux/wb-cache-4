5000|$|A <b>splice</b> <b>box</b> (also {{known as}} splice distributor) is a housing in which fiber optic cables begin or end. Fiber optics are fanned out in splice boxes that are {{situated}} {{at the end of}} fiber optic transmission paths.|$|E
50|$|The main {{components}} of a <b>splice</b> <b>box</b> are the splice cassette that picks up the fibers and their reserves, and the front panel which contains different connectors for transmitting signals via copper or fiber optic cables. The splice cassette is removable in order to assemble fiber optics with a splice unit. The front panel can also be removed to splice the fibers to various connectors.|$|E
5000|$|Since modern splice {{cassettes}} already {{contain a}} splice tray, a splice holder, couplings and pigtails, {{the installation of}} the cables is facilitated. So-called hybrid splice boxes do not only ensure data transmission via copper cables RJ45 or fiber optics, but they also ensure the power supply. That becomes especially important when a <b>splice</b> <b>box</b> needs to be installed in indoor or outdoor applications that are difficult to access.|$|E

50|$|Fiber to {{the office}} (FTTO) is an {{alternative}} cabling concept for LAN network office environments. It combines passive elements (fibre optic cabling, patch panels, <b>splice</b> <b>boxes,</b> connectors and standard copper 8P8C patch cords) and active mini-switches (called FTTO switches) to provide end devices with Gigabit Ethernet. FTTO involves centralised optical fibre cabling techniques to create a combined backbone/horizontal channel; this channel is provided from the work areas to the centralised cross-connect or interconnect by allowing the use of pull-through cables or splices in the telecommunications room.|$|R

50|$|Installation of OPGW {{requires}} some additional planning {{because it is}} impractical to splice an OPGW cable in mid-span; the lengths of cable purchased must be coordinated with the spans between towers to prevent waste. Where fibers must be joined between lengths, a weatherproof <b>splice</b> <b>box</b> is installed on a tower; a similar box is used to transition from the OPGW to an outside plant fiber-only cable to connect the fibers to terminal equipment.|$|E
40|$|The dissertation’s {{objective}} {{is to create a}} reference manual to project an installation of optical fiber in a building (for each house or business) in either horizontal deployment (rack configuration, <b>splicing</b> <b>boxes,</b> duct network, [...] .) and vertical deployment (the building itself). For give these guidelines, we use an example project to show what we’re trying to achieve. This manual is designed for engineers or designers wishing to compare their approach with the approach of a company specialized in this sector, and that, while this one is been overseen by a state telecommunications operator. By this way, we get greater credibility when we advise an installation. First of all, we will present the current state of telecommunications in Andorra, as well as the existing legislation that regulates it and the objective of the proposed deployment of FTTH. In the following chapter, we will explain in detail, what is FTTH technology, which are the elements that make up this kind of network, the various topologies existing, [...] . Then, we will make a summary of the engineering rules used for projecting both horizontal and vertical deployment, based on customer’s criterion, as well as the experience of the company in optical fiber. Later, we will introduce in the case that concerns us: the description of the area to project with some documentation, on the one hand to make the horizontal projection (studies of population density) and secondly, to make the vertical projection of each unique building (structure of the buildings); Will continue explaining the solution adopted in each case, as well as all the elements involved in each building (materials, kinds of splices, measures, [...] .) according to the criterion described above. At the end, we will give an overview of the status of the area once has been validated and installed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTick-borne {{encephalitis}} (TBE) is {{a serious}} human neurological disease caused by TBE virus (TBEV). However, the mechanisms of TBEV-caused pathogenesis remain unclear. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, also defined as the unfolded protein response (UPR), is an important conserved molecular signaling pathway that modulates many biological functions including innate immunity and viral pathogenesis. Here, we investigated {{the effects of the}} two UPR signaling pathways upon TBEV infection in Vero E 6 cells. We showed that the amount of heat shock protein 72 (Hsp 72) increased in the course of TBEV infection. We then confirmed that TBEV infection activates the IRE 1 pathway, leading to RNA and protein expression of the <b>spliced</b> X <b>box</b> binding protein 1 (sXBP 1). Furthermore, we observed the translocation of ATF 6 during TBEV infection and expression of cleaved transcription factor 6 (ATF 6) which suggest activation of ATF 6 pathway. Finally, we examined whether inhibition of the IRE 1 pathway has an effect on TBEV infection. Cell treatment with 3, 5 -Dibromosalicylaldehyde (IRE 1 inhibitor) and tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) showed that TBEV replication was significantly limited. These findings provide the first evidence that TBEV infection activates the two UPR signaling pathways. Moreover, inhibition of TBEV replication by UPR inhibitors may provide a novel therapeutic strategy against TBE...|$|R
40|$|The human p 68 protein, an SV 40 large T related antigen, is an RNA {{dependent}} ATPase and RNA helicase. It {{belongs to}} a new large and highly conserved gene family, the DEAD box proteins, whose members {{are involved in a}} variety of processes requiring manipulation of RNA secondary structure such as translation and <b>splicing.</b> Multiple DEAD <b>box</b> genes are present in S. cerevisiae, but only one has previously been described in E. coli. Low stringency screening of an E. coli genomic library with a p 68 cDNA probe led to the identification of dbpA, a new E. coli DEAD box gene located at 29. 6 minutes on the W 3110 chromosome. We report here the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the gene. We have overexpressed dbpA from its own promoter on a high copy number plasmid and identified the gene product as a approximately 50 kD protein by immunoblotting with an anti-DEAD antibody...|$|R
40|$|Endoplasmic {{reticulum}} (ER) {{stress in}} pancreas, liver, and adipose tissue {{is a key}} event in the pathogenesis of obesity-related metabolic disease. Lipid-induced ER stress in liver and adipose tissue leads to inhibition of insulin signaling. Whether this mechanism exists in skeletal muscle is currently unknown. The present study aimed at assessing the ER stress response in skeletal muscle of subjects receiving a hyper-caloric fat-rich diet (HFD). Seven healthy males (20. 6  ±  0. 5  years; 70. 9  ±  3. 4  kg) volunteered {{to participate in the}} study. They received a hyper-caloric (+ 30 % kcal) fat-rich (50 % kcal) diet for 6  weeks. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed, and muscle biopsies were taken before and after HFD. HFD increased body mass by ~ 3  kg (P =  0. 007) and the sum of skinfolds by 15 % (P =  0. 003). After HFD, blood glucose concentrations were higher during OGTT (two-way ANOVA, P =  0. 023; + 45 % at 20  min, P =  0. 002), and fasting plasma insulin level tended to be higher (+ 20 %). HFD increased intramyocellular lipids content by ~ 50 and 75 % in type I (P =  0. 0009) and IIa fibers (P =  0. 002), respectively. The protein expression of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 α, protein kinase R-like ER protein kinase, BiP and calnexin and the mRNA level of <b>spliced</b> X <b>box</b> binding protein- 1, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein and activating transcription factor 4 were not changed after HFD. Despite the increase in body mass, subcutaneous fat deposits, and intramyocellular lipids content, ER stress markers were unchanged in skeletal muscle of subjects receiving a HFD for 6  weeks. This suggests that the onset of glucose intolerance is not related to ER stress in skeletal muscle...|$|R
40|$|West Nile virus (WNV) -mediated {{neuronal}} {{death is a}} hallmark of WNV meningitis and encephalitis. However, the mechanisms of WNV-induced neuronal damage are not well understood. We investigated WNV neuropathogenesis by using human neuroblastoma cells and primary rat hippocampal neurons. We observed that WNV activates multiple unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways, leading to transcriptional and translational induction of UPR target genes. We evaluated {{the role of the}} three major UPR pathways, namely, inositol-requiring enzyme 1 -dependent <b>splicing</b> of X <b>box</b> binding protein 1 (XBP 1) mRNA, activation of activating transcription factor 6 (ATF 6), and protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) kinase-dependent eukaryotic initiation factor 2 α (eIF 2 α) phosphorylation, in WNV-infected cells. We show that XBP 1 is nonessential or can be replaced by other UPR pathways in WNV replication. ATF 6 was rapidly degraded by proteasomes, consistent with induction of ER stress by WNV. We further observed a transient phosphorylation of eIF 2 α and induction of the proapoptotic cyclic AMP response element-binding transcription factor homologous protein (CHOP). WNV-infected cells exhibited a number of apoptotic phenotypes, such as (i) induction of growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene 34, (ii) activation of caspase- 3, and (iii) cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. The expression of WNV nonstructural proteins alone was sufficient to induce CHOP expression. Importantly, WNV grew to significantly higher viral titers in chop−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) than in wild-type MEFs, suggesting that CHOP-dependent premature cell death represents a host defense mechanism to limit viral replication that might also be responsible for the widespread neuronal loss observed in WNV-infected neuronal tissue...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceGenetics Interdepartmental Program - Plant PathologyFrank F. WhiteSanzhen LiuPlants and {{bacterial}} pathogens are {{in constant}} co-evolution {{to survive and}} sustain the next generation. Plants have two well-characterized levels of active defense -pathogens-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) -triggered immunity (PTI) and effectors-triggered immunity (ETI). Some plants that are hosts for bacterial pathogens employing type three secretion system transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors have evolved a unique form of ETI, namely TAL effector-mediated ETI. TAL effectors induce expression of specific disease susceptibility (S) genes. Rice and pepper have evolved resistance genes termed terminator (T) genes, which have promoters that bind TAL effectors and, upon expression of the T gene, elicit a hypersensitive reaction (HR) and cell death. Only five T genes have been cloned, and the origin of most T genes is unknown. To determine the presence of candidate T genes in other plants species, a bioinformatics-based mining was designed. The basic approach utilized three structural features common to four terminator genes: a short trans-membrane domain, a secretion signal domain, and a length of < 200 amino acid residues. Soybean {{was chosen as the}} test plant species, and 161 genes were retrieved that fulfilled the three parameters using R and Perl software programs. Further, functional annotation of candidate genes was conducted by comparisons to genes in public databases. Major classes of proteins found included unique and hypothetical, defense/stress/oxidative stress associated, DNA-binding, kinases, transferases, hydrolases, effector-related tRNA <b>splicing,</b> and F- <b>box</b> domain proteins. The potential T genes will serve as candidates for experimental validation and new resources for durable resistance strategies in crop species...|$|R
40|$|Pre-mRNA {{processing}} occurs by {{assembly of}} splicing factors on the substrate {{to form the}} spliceosome followed by two consecutive RNA cleavage-ligation reactions. The Prp 2 protein hydrolyzes ATP and {{is required for the}} first reaction (Yean SL, Lin RJ, 1991, Mol Cell Biol 11 : 5571 - 5577; Kim SH, Smith J, Claude A, Lin RJ, 1992, EMBO J 11 : 2319 - 2326). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae SPP 2 gene was previously identified as a high-copy suppressor of temperature-sensitive prp 2 mutants (Last RL, Maddock JR, Woolford JL Jr, 1987, Genetics 117 : 619 - 631). We have characterized the function of Spp 2 p in vivo and in vitro. Spp 2 p is an essential protein required for the first RNA cleavage reaction in vivo. Depletion of Spp 2 p from yeast cells results in accumulation of unspliced pre-mRNAs. A temperature-sensitive spp 2 - 1 mutant accumulates pre-mRNAs in vivo and is unable to undergo the first splicing reaction in vitro. However, spliceosomal complexes are assembled in extracts prepared from the mutant. We show that Spp 2 p function is required after spliceosome assembly but prior to the first reaction. Spp 2 p associates with the spliceosome before the first RNA cleavage reaction and is likely to be released from the spliceosome following ATP hydrolysis by Prp 2 p. The Prp 2 and Spp 2 proteins are capable of physically interacting with each other. These results suggest that Spp 2 p interacts with Prp 2 p in the spliceosome prior to the first cleavage-ligation reaction. Spp 2 p is the first protein that has been found to interact with a DEAD/H <b>box</b> <b>splicing</b> factor...|$|R
