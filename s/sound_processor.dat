25|$|A phaser is an {{electronic}} <b>sound</b> <b>processor</b> used to filter a signal {{by creating a}} series of peaks and troughs in the frequency spectrum. The position of the peaks and troughs of the waveform being affected is typically modulated so that they vary over time, creating a sweeping effect. For this purpose, phasers usually include a low-frequency oscillator.|$|E
25|$|In 1959–1960, Harald Bode {{developed}} a modular synthesizer and <b>sound</b> <b>processor,</b> and in 1961, {{he wrote a}} paper exploring the concept of self-contained portable modular synthesizer using newly emerging transistor technology. He also served as AES session chairman on music and electronic for the fall conventions in 1962 and 1964. His ideas were adopted by Donald Buchla and Robert Moog in the United States, and Paolo Ketoff et al. in Italy {{at about the same}} time: among them, Moog is known as the first synthesizer designer to popularize the voltage control technique in analog electronic musical instruments.|$|E

500|$|Featuring a {{total of}} eight {{processors}} the Saturn's main central processing units are two Hitachi SH-2 microprocessors clocked at 28.6MHz and capable of 56 MIPS. The system contains a Motorola 68EC000 running at 11.3MHz as a sound controller, a custom <b>sound</b> <b>processor</b> with an integrated Yamaha FH1 DSP running at 22.6MHz capable of up to 32 sound channels with both FM synthesis and 16-bit PCM sampling at a maximum rate of 44.1kHz, and two video display processors, the VDP1 (which handles sprites, textures and polygons) and the VDP2 (which handles backgrounds). Its double-speed CD-ROM drive is controlled by a dedicated Hitachi SH-1 processor to reduce load times. The Saturn's System Control Unit (SCU), which controls all buses and functions as a co-processor of the main SH-2 CPU, has an internal DSP running at 14.3MHz. The Saturn contains a cartridge slot for memory expansion, 16 Mbit of work random-access memory (RAM), 12 Mbit of video RAM, 4 Mbit of RAM for sound functions, 4 Mbit of CD buffer RAM and 256 Kbit (32 KB) of battery backup RAM. Its video output, provided by a stereo AV cable, displays at resolutions from 320×224 to 704×224 pixels, and is capable of displaying up to 16.77 million colors simultaneously. Physically, the Saturn measures [...] The Saturn was sold packaged with an instruction manual, one control pad, a stereo AV cable, and its 100V AC power supply, with a power consumption of approximately 15W.|$|E
500|$|Physically, the Dreamcast {{measures}} [...] {{and weighs}} [...] [...] The Dreamcast's main CPU is a two-way 360MIPS superscalar Hitachi SH-4 32-bit RISC clocked at 200MHz with an 8 Kbyte instruction cache and 16 Kbyte data cache and a 128-bit graphics-oriented floating-point unit delivering 1.4GFLOPS. Its 100MHz NEC PowerVR2 rendering engine, {{integrated with the}} system's ASIC, is capable of drawing more than 3 million polygons per second and of deferred shading. Sega estimated that the Dreamcast was theoretically capable of rendering 7 million raw polygons per second, or 6 million with textures and lighting, but noted that [...] "game logic and physics reduce peak graphic performance." [...] Graphics hardware effects include trilinear filtering, gouraud shading, z-buffering, spatial anti-aliasing, per-pixel translucency sorting and bump mapping. The system can output approximately 16.77 million colors simultaneously and displays interlaced or progressive scan video at 640×480 video resolution. Its 67MHz Yamaha AICA <b>sound</b> <b>processor,</b> with a 32-bit ARM7 RISC CPU core, can generate 64 voices with PCM or ADPCM, providing ten times {{the performance of the}} Saturn's sound system. [...] The Dreamcast has 16 MB main RAM, along with an additional 8 MB of RAM for graphic textures and 2 MB of RAM for sound. [...] The system reads media using a 12x speed Yamaha GD-ROM Drive. In addition to Windows CE, the Dreamcast supports several Sega and middleware application programming interfaces. In most regions, the Dreamcast included a removable modem for online connectivity, which was modular for future upgrades. The original Japanese model and all PAL models had a transfer rate of 33.6kbit/s, while consoles sold in the US and in Japan after September 9, 1999 featured a 56 kbit/s dial-up modem.|$|E
2500|$|Individuals {{under the}} age of two (five in the USA) {{typically}} wear the BAHA device on a Softband. This can be worn from the age of one month as babies tend to tolerate this arrangement very well. When the child's skull bone is sufficiently thick, a titanium [...] "post" [...] can be surgically embedded into the skull with a small abutment exposed outside the skin. The BAHA <b>sound</b> <b>processor</b> sits on this abutment and transmits sound vibrations to the external abutment of the titanium implant. [...] The implant vibrates the skull and inner ear, which stimulate the nerve fibers of the inner ear, allowing hearing.|$|E
50|$|Several {{devices are}} under investigation; however {{there is only}} one {{approved}} device currently available that combines cochlear implant technology with a digital hearing aid.

50|$|Later formats such as Dolby Digital {{retained}} the LFE channel, {{although this is}} more through convention and backwards compatibility than necessity, as digital formats have greater dynamic range than the magnetic analogue recordings on 70 mm prints, and modern <b>sound</b> <b>processors</b> have a bass management system to redirect bass from all channels to a subwoofer.|$|R
2500|$|A {{cochlear}} implant (CI) is a surgically implanted electronic device {{that provides a}} sense of sound {{to a person who}} is profoundly deaf or severely hard of hearing in both ears; as of 2014 they had been used experimentally in some people who had acquired deafness in one ear after learning how to speak. Cochlear implants bypass the normal hearing process; they have a <b>sound</b> <b>processor</b> that resides {{on the outside of the}} skin (and generally worn behind the ear) which contains microphones, electronics, battery, and a coil which transmits a signal to the implant. [...] The implant has a coil to receive signals, electronics, and an array of electrodes which is placed into the cochlea, which stimulate the cochlear nerve.|$|E
2500|$|The Commodore 64, {{also known}} as the C64 or the CBM 64, is an 8-bit home {{computer}} introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International (first shown at the Consumer Electronics Show, in Las Vegas, January 7–10. 1982). It is listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time, with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units. Volume production started in early 1982, marketing in August for [...] Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET, the C64 took its name from its [...] of RAM.

2500|$|Then Microsoft chairman, Bill Gates, {{preferred}} Sony's console to {{the competition}} from Sega, saying [...] "Our game designer likes the Sony machine." [...] Microsoft would later compete with Sony with its Xbox console. In a special Game Machine Cross Review in May 1995, Famicom Tsūshin would score the PlayStation console a 19 out of 40. The staff of Next Generation reviewed the PlayStation {{a few weeks after}} its North American launch. They commented that while the CPU is [...] "fairly average", the supplementary custom hardware such as the GPU and <b>sound</b> <b>processor</b> is stunningly powerful. They particularly praised its focus on 3D, and also remarked positively on the comfort of the controller and the convenience of the memory cards. Giving the system 4 1/2 out of 5 stars, they concluded, [...] "To succeed in this extremely cut-throat market, you need a combination of great hardware, great games, and great marketing. Whether by skill, luck, or just deep pockets, Sony has scored three out of three in the first salvo of this war." [...] An advertisement slogan used in marketing the console was, [...] "Live in your world. Play in ours." [...] It is stylised as, [...] "LIVE IN YUR WRLD. PLY IN URS." [...] Another briefly used advertising campaign was titled [...] "You Are Not Ready" [...] or [...] "U R NOT [...]" [...] Sony's CCO Lee Clow explained that [...] "it's the ultimate challenge. Gamers love to respond to that tag line and say 'Bullshit. Let me show you how ready I am.'" ...|$|E
50|$|Their {{software}} also {{attempts to}} expand the relationship between acoustic instruments and the computer. An {{example of this is}} a score-following program called ComParser.

ComParser follows the tempo of the musician. ComParser is not a pitch-follower, but a spectrum-follower.|$|R
5000|$|In 1996, Rolling Stone writer Frank Broughton {{observed}} that [...] "a Josh Wink record takes {{a series of}} sampled noises, then twists and warps them through a barrage of <b>sound</b> <b>processors,</b> resulting in a spiraling blend of acidic bass lines and trippy break beats." [...] Another reviewer referred to Wink's Profound Sounds album series as [...] "sensual techno, rendered as a whole composition rather than a collection of individual, flavor-of-the-month tracks." ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>sound</b> <b>processors</b> {{include the}} EQ, Compressor, Smart Gate, Chorus, Echo and Stereo Chorus/Delay. The Stereo Chorus/Delay was {{released}} first in 1986. It {{can be used}} as either a chorus or delay. The chorus effect can be mono or stereo. The Chorus/Delay is used for doubling, slap-back and reverb-like short echoes. Combining the Stereo Chorus/Delay with a Sustainor provides a complete system for recording guitar. 1987 brought the Instrument EQ, Stereo Echo and Stereo Chorus.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is about}} the first substantial restoration of human sense using a medical intervention. In particular, {{the development of the}} modern cochlear implant (CI) is described, with a focus on <b>sound</b> <b>processors</b> for CIs. As of October 2015, more than 460 thousand persons had each received a single CI on one side or bilateral CIs for both sides. More than 75 percent of users of the present-day devices use the telephone routinely, including conversations with previously unknown persons and with varying and unpredictable topics. That ability is a long trip indeed from severe or worse losses in hearing. The <b>sound</b> <b>processors,</b> in conjunction with multiple sites of highly-controlled electrical stimulation in the cochlea, made the trip possible. Many methods and techniques were used in the described research, including but not limited to those of signal processing, electrical engineering, neuroscience, speech science, and hearing science. In addition, the results were the products of collaborative efforts, beginning in the late 1970 s. For example, our teams at the Duke University Medical Center and the Research Triangle Institute worked closely with investigators at 27 other universities worldwide. The most important outcome from the research was unprecedented levels of speech reception for users of CIs, which moved a previously experimental treatment into the mainstream of clinical practice.
