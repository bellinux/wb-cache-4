Tennessee Titans head coach Jeff Fisher and players from the team, past and present, competed in order to benefit local charities. Titans {{participants}} included Vince Young, <b>Steve</b> <b>McNair,</b> Eddie George, Frank Wycheck, Rob Bironas, and Keith Bulluck, among others. Tomáš Vokoun and head coach Barry Trotz of the National Hockey League's Nashville Predators have also taken part.|$|E
25|$|Jamal Lewis ran for 109 {{yards on}} 31 attempts. <b>Steve</b> <b>McNair</b> ran for 23 yards on 5 carries and {{completed}} 17 passes out of 23 for 159 yards.|$|E
25|$|In one of {{the coldest}} games in NFL history, with {{temperatures}} reaching , the Patriots survived the cold and NFL co-MVP <b>Steve</b> <b>McNair,</b> relying on yet another game-winning field goal from kicker Adam Vinatieri late {{in the fourth quarter}} and a key defensive stand.|$|E
50|$|This was <b>Steve</b> <b>McNair's</b> {{final season}} as a Titan before getting traded to the Baltimore Ravens {{following}} the season.|$|R
2500|$|In <b>Steve</b> <b>McNair's</b> {{return from}} a {{strained}} neck and concussion last week, he dominated while running for one touchdown and threw for 2. The Baltimore Ravens snapped a 2-game losing streak with this 35–22 win October 29, 2006. The Ravens defense was excellent as well. They had four interceptions, two for touchdowns by Ronnie Prude and Dawan Landry, and a fumble recovery. [...] Bart Scott knocked Reggie Bush {{out of the game}} with an ankle injury in the fourth quarter.|$|R
5000|$|On July 24, 1999, O'Donnell {{signed a}} multi-year {{contract}} with the Titans where he would serve as <b>Steve</b> <b>McNair's</b> backup. He performed well, winning four of his five starts for an injured McNair in 1999, leaving a perennial [...]500 team at 5-1 upon McNair's return. Later, O'Donnell came off the bench and led Tennessee to a Week 17 47-36 victory in Pittsburgh {{en route to the}} AFC Championship and Super Bowl XXXIV, in which he was not an active participant.|$|R
25|$|The Colts {{have only}} allowed 26 points to be scored {{against them in}} four games so far, which is a {{franchise}} record. The Titans never really got anything going on offense, and Tennessee quarterback <b>Steve</b> <b>McNair</b> was their leading rusher for the team in this game.|$|E
25|$|<b>Steve</b> <b>McNair</b> {{brought a}} calm {{leadership}} presence to the quarterback role {{that had been}} absent from the franchise since its inception. The critical issue in the '06 season remained whether McNair would hearken back to his Pro Bowl performance days or whether {{the cumulative effect of}} injuries would continue to hamper his performance.|$|E
25|$|In the 2006 offseason, the Baltimore Ravens were in {{negotiations}} {{to try to}} obtain veteran quarterback <b>Steve</b> <b>McNair</b> from the Tennessee Titans. On Sunday, April 30, 2006, the Titans allowed McNair {{to speak with the}} Ravens and on May 1, 2006, the Baltimore Sun stated that the Baltimore Ravens had been waiting for McNair to be released by the Titans since it was the free agency period. The deal was completed in June 2006.|$|E
50|$|McNair had {{two sons}} by Mechelle: Tyler and Trenton; {{and two sons}} - <b>Steve</b> LaTreal <b>McNair,</b> Jr. and Steven O'Brian Koran McNair - by two other women.|$|R
50|$|For San Francisco, Colin Kaepernick {{completed}} 16 of 28 {{passes for}} 302 {{yards and a}} touchdown, while also rushing for 62 yards and another score, but had 1 interception. His 62 rushing yards were the second highest total by a quarterback in the Super Bowl, behind Tennessee Titans quarterback <b>Steve</b> <b>McNair's</b> record of 64 in Super Bowl XXXIV. Kaepernick also set a Super Bowl record for the longest rushing touchdown from a quarterback for his 15-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter. This beat the previous 6-yard record held by the 49ers' Joe Montana achieved in Super Bowl XIX.|$|R

They had four interceptions, two for touchdowns by Ronnie Prude and Dawan Landry, and a fumble recovery. Bart Scott knocked Reggie Bush {{out of the game}} with an ankle injury in the fourth quarter. This was the first game the New Orleans Saints have lost in the Louisiana Superdome since the stadium reopened for the 2006 season.|$|R
25|$|After {{opening the}} 2003 NFL {{season with a}} 2–2 start, Brady led the Patriots to twelve {{consecutive}} victories to finish the regular season in winning the AFC East. Statistically, Brady's strongest {{game of the season}} was against the division rival Buffalo Bills, when he achieved a season-high quarterback rating of 122.9. Brady finished with 3,620 passing yards and 23 touchdowns, and was third in NFL MVP voting to co-winners Peyton Manning and <b>Steve</b> <b>McNair.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Colts {{continued}} their undefeated streak {{this week as}} they mightily defeated the Tennessee Titans 35–3. So far, the Colts had won seven of their last nine games by at least 17 points, and averaged more than 35 points per game.

Titans QB <b>Steve</b> <b>McNair</b> was 22 of 33 with 220 yards passing and had one fumble.|$|E
25|$|In a {{defensive}} struggle, Gary Anderson kicked the winning 46-yard field {{goal for the}} Titans with 29 seconds left. The winning kick was set up after a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty on Ravens offensive lineman Orlando Brown forced Baltimore to punt and enabled Tennessee to start its final drive from its own 37-yard line. Titans quarterback <b>Steve</b> <b>McNair</b> threw three interceptions. Meanwhile, the Ravens running back Jamal Lewis, the league's regular season rushing leader, was limited to 35 yards on 14 carries.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Patriots first {{defeated}} the Tennessee Titans, 17–14, {{in one of}} the coldest games in NFL history, with temperatures reaching 4°F (−15°C). New England jumped to 14–7 lead in the first half with a touchdown pass by Brady and a touchdown run from Smith. However, quarterback <b>Steve</b> <b>McNair's</b> 11-yard touchdown pass to receiver Derrick Mason tied the game in the third period. With 4:06 remaining in the game, Patriots kicker Adam Vinatieri made a 46-yard field goal to take the lead. New England's defense later clinched a victory as they stopped the Titans from scoring on fourth down on their last drive of the game.|$|R
25|$|Titans {{defensive}} back Samari Rolle gave his team an early scoring opportunity when he intercepted Tommy Maddox's first pass {{of the game}} and returned it 16 yards to the Tennessee 48-yard line. The Titans then drove 52 yards in seven plays to score on quarterback <b>Steve</b> <b>McNair's</b> 8-yard scramble. Following a Steelers punt, Tennessee drove 76 yards in 16 plays to score on Eddie George's 1-yard touchdown run. The key player of the drive was receiver Drew Bennett, who was responsible for two of the drive's four third down conversions. He caught a 19-yard pass on third and 16 from the Titans 36, and later hauled in a 9-yard catch on third and 8 from the Steelers 43.|$|R
25|$|Later in the quarter, Cory Ross' 18-yard {{punt return}} gave the Ravens {{a first down}} on the Colts' 42-yard line. Six plays later, Matt Stover kicked a 40-yard field goal on the first play of the second quarter to cut their deficit to 6–3. Two plays after the ensuing kickoff, Baltimore safety Ed Reed intercepted a pass from Peyton Manning at the Ravens' 45-yard line. Baltimore {{subsequently}} moved to {{the ball to the}} Colts' 4-yard line, but then gave it back when <b>Steve</b> <b>McNair's</b> third-down pass was intercepted by Antoine Bethea. Following the turnover, the Colts marched 63 yards in 13 plays and scored with Vinatieri's third field goal, which hit the cross bar and bounced through the uprights, to give them a 9–3 halftime lead.|$|R
25|$|The Panthers got on {{the board}} first with a 21-yard field goal by kicker John Kasay. Ravens quarterback <b>Steve</b> <b>McNair</b> was knocked {{out in the first}} quarter with a concussion, and backup Kyle Boller took over, {{connecting}} on a touchdown pass with Mark Clayton, on a pass intended for Derrick Mason that was tipped to Clayton. The Panthers responded when Drew Carter caught a 42-yard touchdown pass from Jake Delhomme, and Kasay kicked another field goal, this time from 31 yards. The Panthers went into halftime with a 13–7 lead.|$|E
25|$|Tennessee wide {{receiver}} Derrick Mason returned the ensuing kickoff 35 {{yards to the}} 34-yard line. From there, five runs by George good for 24 yards, three completions from quarterback <b>Steve</b> <b>McNair</b> to tight end Frank Wycheck for 15 yards and a run by McNair for two advanced {{the ball to the}} St. Louis 25-yard line. Then McNair scrambled 23 yards to the 2-yard line, setting up a 1-yard touchdown run by George two plays later. The touchdown cut the Titans' deficit to 16–6 after McNair's pass to Wycheck on the two-point conversion attempt fell incomplete.|$|E
25|$|First quarter {{consisted}} of a five-yard quarterback draw by <b>Steve</b> <b>McNair</b> which made the score 7–0. Early {{in the second quarter}}, Clarence Moore caught a short four-yard pass in the endzone to make it 14–0. About 6 minutes later, Ronnie Prude intercepted Drew Brees for a 12-yard interception return. Later on, Drew Brees passed to Joe Horn for a 32-yard touchdown pass to make it 21–7. Late in the second quarter tight end Todd Heap was passed a ball that was another Baltimore touchdown to make it 28–7 at halftime.|$|E
2500|$|The Ravens {{opened the}} regular season on the road against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on September 10. In QB <b>Steve</b> <b>McNair's</b> inaugural start as a Raven, the team gave a {{dominating}} performance. RB Jamal Lewis got the team's first points as he ran into the endzone on a four-yard touchdown strike in the first quarter. Then, in the second quarter, CB Chris McAlister intercepted a pass from Tampa Bay QB Chris Simms and ran 60 yards for another touchdown. Rookie Haloti Ngata recorded his first career interception and also returned for 60 yards to set up kicker Matt Stover with a 20-yard field goal to put the Ravens up 17–0 at halftime. Baltimore continued to suppress Tampa Bay in the second half, as Stover kicked a 42-yard field goal {{in the third quarter}} to put Baltimore up 20–0. In the fourth quarter, McNair put the game away with a 4-yard pass to TE Daniel Wilcox. While the Ravens offense had a very good start to the 2006 season, the defense also showed much promise, as they forced Simms into throwing three interceptions and limited star RB Carnell [...] "Cadillac" [...] Williams to just 22 yards on eight carries. For his efforts in this game Ray Lewis was named NFL Defensive Player of the Week after recording 10 tackles and a sack. With the win, the Ravens were 1–0 and 1–0 against NFC Opponents.|$|R

They had last won 12 games during the 2000 season, after which they went on to win Super Bowl XXXV in Tampa.|$|E
25|$|The Ravens opened Week 2 with a home-opener {{against the}} visiting Oakland Raiders. From the get-go, the Ravens {{dominated}} the game. The Ravens forced two fumbles by Oakland QB Aaron Brooks {{in the first}} quarter which led to two of Baltimore kicker's Matt Stover three field goals (25, 33, and 37-yarders).

After forcing a punt, the Titans drove 56 yards in 11 plays. Kicker Al Del Greco initially missed a 45-yard field goal attempt, but the Bills were penalized for defensive holding on the play, and Del Greco's second attempt was good from 40 yards on the last play of the half. At the end of the half, the Bills were trailing 12–0 and had only managed to gain 64 yards, while also losing 44 yards on nine penalties.|$|E
25|$|The Ravens got on {{the board}} first when Matt Stover kicked a 24-yard field goal, {{following}} a fumble by Broncos RB Tatum Bell. The Broncos responded with a 43-yard field goal of their own by Jason Elam. The Ravens drove deep into Broncos territory late {{at the end of}} the first half, but that drive was thwarted as <b>Steve</b> <b>McNair</b> was intercepted by Champ Bailey in the end zone on a pass intended for Clarence Moore. The third quarter saw no points scored by either team as the defensive struggle continued. The Broncos controlled the clock in the second half with the running game led by Tatum Bell, who atoned for his fumble in the first quarter, by bouncing back with 92 yards rushing. Ravens QB McNair was intercepted again by Darrent Williams, which led to a Jake Plummer to Rod Smith touchdown pass. McNair was intercepted a third time, ending the Ravens' final drive, this time by Domonique Foxworth. With their first loss, the Ravens dropped to 4–1.|$|E
25|$|The Patriots had the NFL's {{best record}} at 14–2 and, {{for the first}} time in their history, earned the top seed in the AFC 2003-04 playoffs, {{ensuring}} home-field advantage throughout. Their opponent in the divisional playoffs was the Tennessee Titans. Played in a temperature of 4°F (-16°C) (making it the second-coldest game in NFL history), the Patriots and Titans played close until Adam Vinatieri kicked the go-ahead field goal with 4 minutes left. An incomplete <b>Steve</b> <b>McNair</b> pass on 4th down with 1:40 left won the game 17–14 for New England. The Patriots then faced the Indianapolis Colts for the AFC Championship. The New England defense frustrated Colts quarterback Peyton Manning all day, forcing him to throw four interceptions (three to Ty Law) and sacking him three times. Despite only one offensive touchdown by the Patriots, the team was dominant. Still, the Colts remained in the game until the very end, when a late Vinatieri field goal with 10 seconds left gave the Patriots their final margin of victory, 24–14. The Patriots were back in the Super Bowl, this time to face the Carolina Panthers.|$|E
25|$|Despite George's {{impressive}} day, {{he actually}} struggled {{for most of}} the first half, gaining only 38 yards on nine carries while kickers Mike Vanderjagt and Al Del Greco spent the first two quarters trading field goals. Indianapolis scored first on their second drive with a 42-yard drive that ended with a 40-yard field goal by Vanderjagt. After a punt from each team, Tennessee drove 46 yards to tie the score on Del Greco's 49-yard field goal on the first play of the second quarter. Following two more punts, Indy put together the longest drive so far from either team, moving the ball 62 yards in seven plays, including Manning's 33-yard completion to receiver E. G. Green, to take a 6-3 lead on Vanderjagt's 40-yard field goal. Derrick Mason returned the ensuing kickoff 47 yards to the Titans' 47-yard line. Two plays later, a 29-yard scramble from quarterback <b>Steve</b> <b>McNair</b> set up Del Greco's 37-yard field goal kick. Manning then completed 5/6 passes for 57 yards and rushed for seven on a 66-yard drive that ended with the team taking a 9-6 lead with Vanderjagt's 34-yard field goal with six seconds left in the first half.|$|E
25|$|McNabb was {{selected}} as a first alternate to the NFC Pro Bowl squad in 2000 (behind Daunte Culpepper, Jeff Garcia, and Kurt Warner). When Warner was unable to participate due to injury, McNabb took his spot and led the NFC on a touchdown scoring drive in his first series. He accounted for 74.6% of the team's total net yards in 2000. Only Carolina's Steve Beuerlein (75.3%) and San Francisco's Garcia (75.1%) had a higher percentage. His 629 rushing yards in 2000 were the highest among NFL quarterbacks and, at the time, the fourth-highest total ever (968 by Bobby Douglass in 1972; 942 by Randall Cunningham in 1990; and 674 by <b>Steve</b> <b>McNair</b> in 1997. Michael Vick has since eclipsed that total three times). His six rushing touchdowns in 2000 were the most by an Eagles quarterback since Randall Cunningham, who also had six in 1988. McNabb broke the club's single season record for most attempts (569) and completions (330) in 2000, marks previously set by Cunningham (560 and 301 respectively) in 1988. He was named 2000 NFL Player of the Year by CBS Radio and the Terry (Bradshaw) Awards on Fox Sports and {{was named to the}} All-Madden team.|$|E
25|$|The Chargers went to Baltimore for {{the first}} time since 2000. The Chargers led down the field first with a 31-yard {{touchdown}} pass to WR Malcom Floyd. However, this was followed two drives later by an interception by OLB Bart Scott (who was named September's Defensive Player of the Month recently before the game), which led to a 5-yard touchdown pass from QB <b>Steve</b> <b>McNair</b> to TE Daniel Wilcox. In the second quarter, 2 Chargers field goals from kicker Nate Kaeding put San Diego in the lead at the half. In the third quarter, the Ravens' defense held the Chargers to no points. They were assisted by a loud stadium, which led to a fourth quarter intentional safety by Chargers punter Mike Scifres. The Ravens took the ball at the 40-yard line with 3:12 to go. After Derrick Mason dropped a possible touchdown pass early in the drive, a 10-yard pass to TE Todd Heap won the game with 30 seconds to play. On the touchdown catch, Heap broke a tackle from Shawne Merriman. With the win, the Ravens were 4–0 {{for the first}} time in their 11-year history. However, Guard Edwin Mulitalo was injured for the entire season with a triceps injury.|$|E
