25|$|The WC {{was popular}} in the Great Depression for its good value, {{affordable}} price, and frugal design elements. Two factors that lowered its cost of manufacture, and thus its sales price, were that it was made partially from off-the-shelf components, and that its <b>steel</b> <b>channel</b> iron frame eliminated the need for large, heavy castings for the transmission and rear end (as were often used in tractors of the era). Its power was ample for the time and class, allowing it to pull a two-bottom plow.|$|E

2500|$|Each {{box section}} {{comprised}} two 9.8-metre wide dual lane traffic tubes and a 1.35 metres wide twin walled central tube for services and emergency access. The 1.2-metre thick base slab was cast first, {{followed by the}} 50cm thick central walls. [...] The outer walls and roof were cast together in a single operation, in six nominal 20-metre lengths, using special travelling formwork. [...] This was struck inside the formed section, moved along to the next length and then jacked up into position, each within a 72-hour cycle. [...] Each 1000 cubic metre pour required approximately 1500 square metres of formwork. The inside shutters for the outer walls were vertical steel section panels and Alform Beam walers, which were attached to the top slab of the special steel traveller, while the outer shutters were crane handled vertical steel section panels with Alform Beam or <b>steel</b> <b>channel</b> walers.|$|E

Abstract: 8 <b>channel</b> <b>steel</b> {{reinforced concrete}} beams and 1 reinforced concrete beam are tested {{to study the}} capacity of <b>channel</b> <b>steel</b> reinforced concrete beam(CSRCB) under pure torque. The failure mode and process of the specimens are observed, And the working mechanism of <b>channel</b> <b>steel</b> skeleton and the concrete are analyzed. It is shown that the concrete strength, stirrup disposition and <b>channel</b> <b>steel</b> have significant effects on the torsional capacity of the beam. The calculation formula for torsional craze torque and ultimate torsional capacity of the CSRCB member are also proposed. Experimental Outline 8 <b>channel</b> <b>steel</b> reinforced concrete beams and 1 contrast RC beam are designed to test the torsional behaviour.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the structural {{performance of the}} proposed prefabricated pad footing foundation using BRC as reinforcement and Cold-formed <b>Steel</b> Lipped <b>Channel</b> Section as permanent formwork. Steel bars or mesh has been used traditionally in reinforced concrete. Cold-formed Steel {{has the advantage of}} higher yield strength as an effect of cold working, plus its pre-galvanised metal has high resistance to corrosion. However, the use of Cold-formed <b>Steel</b> Lipped <b>Channel</b> Section for prefabrication of pad footing structures is yet to be established. Investigation has been carried out by examining the structural performance of both the proposed and typical footings. Experimental tests of 3 typical and 3 proposed pad footings were carried out in Structural and Material Lab, UTM. Comparison on the failure mode and ultimate load was made between the two set of specimens. The results shown that the proposed pad footing performed better compared to typical footing. It is concluded that pad footing foundation designed using Cold-formed <b>Steel</b> Lipped <b>Channel</b> Sections is feasible for construction...|$|R

40|$|The channel {{failures}} due to combined bending and web crippling may {{occur at the}} highly concentrated interior loading {{when there is no}} load stiffener in cold-formed thin-walled steel beams. This paper presents accurate finite element models to predict the behavior and ultimate strengths of cold-formed <b>steel</b> <b>channels</b> subjected to pure bending as well as combined bending and web crippling. Both geometric and material nonlinearities are considered in the finite element analysis. The nonlinear finite element models are verified against experimental results of cold-formed <b>steel</b> <b>channels</b> subjected to pure bending as well as combined bending and web crippling. The finite element analytical results show a good agreement with the experimental results in terms of the ultimate loads and moments, failure modes and web load-deformation curves thus validating the accuracy of the finite element models. The verified finite element models are then used for an extensive parametric study of different channel dimensions. The channel strengths predicted from the parametric study are compared with the design strengths calculated from the North American Specification for cold-formed steel structures. It is shown that the design rules in the North American Specification are generally conservative for channel sections with unstiffened flanges having the web slenderness ranged from 7. 8 to 108. 5 subjected to combined bending and web crippling. It is demonstrated that the nonlinear finite element analysis by using the verified finite element models against test results is an effective way to predict the ultimate strengths of cold-formed thin-walled steel members. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|The Riggenbach {{rack system}} used a ladder rack, formed of <b>steel</b> <b>channels</b> {{connected}} by square rungs at regular intervals, {{to engage the}} pinion wheels of the rack engine. The rungs of the NZASM rack track were spaced 4 in apart. To ensure correct meshing of the gears when entering the rack section, engaging pieces of special section, 6 ft long and fitted with round-bar rungs, were hinged to {{each end of the}} rack, supported by a spiral spring underneath. When the rack engine made contact with the hinged section and the gear wheels did not mesh with the rack correctly, the engaging section would be pressed down until correct meshing was accomplished.|$|R
50|$|The grid deck, {{gridiron}} deck, or grid, is a permeable {{working surface}} {{present at the}} top of many fly lofts that is used to support and provide access to many of a rigging system's components. Though originally constructed of wood, down-facing three-inch <b>steel</b> <b>channels</b> with three-inch gaps became the prevalent grid decking in the 20th century. Today, large-opening heavy-duty steel bar grating is most common in new theatres. The grid deck surface is usually rated to support live loads as well as all anticipated dead-hung equipment and hemp and motorized (e.g., chain hoist) spot rigging. Its permeability facilitates the mounting of equipment and the passing of lift lines and electrical cables. Spot rigging is not feasible without a grid.|$|R
