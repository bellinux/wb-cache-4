40|$|Many {{cylindrical}} {{structures in}} engineering applications undergo flow-induced periodic loading {{due to the}} vortex shedding phenomenon. This can lead to early fatigue failure and {{be a source of}} unwanted noise. To mitigate or reduce the mean and fluctuating loading, the flow development can be altered by adding geometrical modifications to the structure. This thesis is focused on the dual <b>step</b> <b>cylinder</b> geometry, which consists of a finite-span circular cylinder (the large cylinder) attached co-axially to the mid-span of a uniform circular cylinder of smaller diameter (the small cylinder). The dual <b>step</b> <b>cylinder</b> is a geometrical modification to a uniform cylinder that is ubiquitous in engineering applications, but has not been investigated extensively for its potential use in flow control. Accordingly, {{there is a need for}} developing an understanding of the flow development and structural loading on dual step cylinders in cross-flow. This thesis provides a comprehensive characterization of the effects of dual <b>step</b> <b>cylinder</b> geometry and Reynolds number on wake development and structural loading in the turbulent vortex shedding regime. Experiments were carried out in the Water Flume Facility at the University of Waterloo and an open jet wind tunnel at TU Delft. Experimental measurements included flow and surface visualizations, wake velocity measurements with Tomographic Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), planar PIV, and Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV), and lift and drag force measurements. Through an analysis of the qualitative and quantitative results, six distinct flow regimes have been identified based on observed changes in the flow development downstream of the large cylinder. The results are summarized in a two-dimensional map which has both practical and fundamental importance. Specifically, the map can be used to select dual <b>step</b> <b>cylinder</b> geometries which produce desirable flow and loading characteristics, and the map provides detailed insight into the turbulent wake development of dual step cylinders and other similar complex cylindrical geometries including cantilevered cylinders, single step cylinders, coin-like cylinders, and cylinders with two free ends. For complex bluff body geometries, such as that of a dual <b>step</b> <b>cylinder,</b> the flow development is highly three-dimensional. In order to investigate such flows experimentally, quantitative measurements of the three-dimensional flow field are required. The presently available techniques of three-dimensional velocity field measurement, e. g., Tomographic PIV, Particle Tracking Velocimetry, and Holography, are expensive to implement and are not yet commonplace in experimental facilities world-wide. The present study employs multi-plane PIV measurements in order to investigate the three-dimensional wake development of a dual <b>step</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Two techniques of multi-plane PIV data analysis are proposed in order to reconstruct the dominant vortical structures and vortex interactions in the wake: (i) a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) based phase-averaging approach, and (ii) a pattern recognition based conditional averaging approach. Through a comparison with Tomographic PIV results, both techniques are shown to successfully reconstruct the wake vortex shedding and vortex interactions downstream of a dual <b>step</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The techniques developed can be applied to complex bluff body flows and can accommodate the presence of more than one dominant frequency...|$|E
40|$|Flow past {{circular}} cylinders with stepwise discontinuities {{in diameter}} was investigated experimentally and numerically for the diameter ratio D/d = 2 and three Reynolds numbers, Re = 150, 300, and 1050. The investigation {{was focused on}} the vortex shedding phenomena occurring {{in the wake of the}} cylinders. In the first series of experimental and numerical studies, the flow development past a single <b>step</b> <b>cylinder</b> was investigated. The single <b>step</b> <b>cylinder</b> model is comprised of a small diameter cylinder (d) attached coaxially to a large diameter cylinder (D). The results show that three distinct spanwise vortex cells form in the <b>step</b> <b>cylinder</b> wake: a single vortex shedding cell in the wake of the small cylinder (the S-cell) and two vortex shedding cells in the wake of the large cylinder, one in the region downstream of the step (the N-cell) and the other away from the step (the L-cell). Due to the differences in vortex shedding frequencies between the three cells, complex vortex connections occur in two vortex-interaction regions located between the adjacent cells. The region at the boundary between the S-cell and the N-cell is relatively narrow and its spanwise extent does not fluctuate significantly. In this region, vortex dislocations manifested as half-loop connections between two S-cell vortices of opposite sign. In contrast, the region at the boundary between the N-cell and the L-cell exhibits a transient behavior, with large scale vortex dislocations causing cyclic variation in the extent of N-cell vortices. For Re = 300 and 1050, small scale streamwise vortices forming in the wake complicate the vortex dynamics within the adjacent S-cell and L-cell. There is no significant Reynolds number effect on the average spanwise extent of the vortex cells and the two transition regions between neighboring cells. Finally, formation of N-cell vortices is linked to downwash fluctuations near the step. The flow development past a dual <b>step</b> <b>cylinder</b> was studied experimentally for Re = 1050. The dual <b>step</b> <b>cylinder</b> model is comprised of a small diameter cylinder (d) and a large diameter cylinder (D) mounted at the mid-span of the small cylinder. The experiments were completed for a range of large cylinder aspect ratios 0. 2 ≤ L/D ≤ 17. The flow development is highly dependent on the aspect ratio of the large cylinder, L/D. The results identify four distinct flow regimes: (i) for L/D = 17, three vortex shedding cells form in the wake of the large cylinder, one central cell and two cells of lower frequency extending over about 4. 5 D from the large cylinder ends, (ii) for 7 < L/D ≤ 14, a single vortex shedding cell forms in the wake of the large cylinder, whose shedding frequency decreases with decreasing L/D, (iii) for 2 ≤ L/D ≤ 7, vortex shedding in the wake of the large cylinder is highly three-dimensional, with vortices deforming in the near wake, (iv) for 0. 2 ≤ L/D ≤ 1, only small cylinder vortices are shed in the wake and can form vortex connections across the wake of the large cylinder...|$|E

The geometry of a <b>stepped</b> <b>cylinder</b> consists of a small diameter cylinder (d) placed {{on top of a}} large diameter cylinder (D). This master thesis has investigated numerically the flow around a <b>stepped</b> <b>cylinder</b> with different diameter ratios (d/D) for a Reynolds number, ReD = 150. The commercial software Fluent v 13. 0 by Ansys was used for the numerical investigation. The aim of the study has been exploring the nearby wake flow as well as the region where the two cylinders are joined. The hydrodynamic forces and vortex shedding frequency have been analysed and compared for the four different diameter ratios: d/D = 0. 3, 0. 5, 0. 8 and 0. 9 The major part of the published papers on the topic is based on experimental studies. Only two papers are based on numerical studies, having considered d/D = 0. 5 exclusively. Earlier studies have focused mainly on vortex shedding in the wake flow, omitting the forces acting on the <b>stepped</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The <b>stepped</b> <b>cylinder</b> has been modelled using the software GAMBIT. A convergence study investigating the domain size and element density was conducted to ensure a grid independent solution. Special attention was directed at the step region to fully resolve the complex flow in this region. The numerical model was verified to be in good agreement with previous experimental- and numerical studies. For the <b>stepped</b> <b>cylinders</b> significant spanwise velocity was detected in the step region. For d/D = 0. 3 and 0. 5, upflow was detected over {{the leading edge of the}} step whereas downwash characterised the trailing edge of the step. Similarities to the flow around a finite length cylinder could be drawn for d/D = 0. 3 and 0. 5, whereas d/D = 0. 8 and 0. 9 resembled that of a straight <b>cylinder.</b> The <b>step</b> was found to affect the wake flow &# 8776; 10 D into D independent of diameter ratio.

40|$|Subject of {{the present}} study was the {{investigation}} of the wake behind <b>stepped</b> circular <b>cylinders.</b> Experiments were performed using particle image velocimetry (PIV). Cylinder models with diameter ratios D/d= 1, D/d= 6 / 5 and D/d= 2 were investigated at Reynolds numbers Re_{D}= 2243. 6, Re_{D}= 12820. 5 and Re_{D}= 51282. 1 with respect to the large diameter. Of main interest were the influences of step size and Reynolds number on the formation of vortex shedding cells. Mean flow characteristics and instantaneous captures of the flow field were analyzed in order to gain insight into vortex development in the wake. Spectral analysis was applied to obtain information on the number of forming vortex shedding cells. It was found that an increase in Re_D leads to a decrease in eddy formation length $L_f$. At the largest investigated Reynolds number, turbulence gained strong influence on the flow characteristics. An increase in stepsize leads to the development of a large and a small diameter wake with distinct eddy formation lengths L_{f,L} and L_{f,S}. Due to a mismatch in vortex shedding frequencies in the two wakes, vortices that come out of phase connect to subsequent vortices on the same side of the step. This occurs more frequently for a higher diameter ratio. Several vortex shedding cells were found in the wake of the <b>step</b> <b>cylinders,</b> their number increasing with the step size and differing for different Reynolds numbers.

40|$|Step {{cylinders}} have numerous applications, for instance, {{radio communication}} towers, airport control-towers, antenna members, etc. Numerous applications motivate researchers {{to investigate this}} bluff body both numerically and experimentally. The single <b>step</b> <b>cylinder</b> model is comprised of a small-diameter cylinder (d) attached coaxially to a large-diameter cylinder (D). In this study vortex shedding from such a bluff body is investigated experimentally using Tomographic Particle Image Velocimetry (TOMO PIV). Experiments are conducted in the low-speed w-tunnel of the aerospace engineering department of TU Delft. The cylinders' diameter ratio D/d is ranging from 1. 14 to 2. 67, and the Reynolds numbers based on the large cylinder are ranging from 2000 to 5100. The TOMO PIV system consists of six CCD cameras subtending an arc and a Nd:YAG laser. LaVision Davis 8 is used for image acquisition and processing. The use of TOMO PIV enables quantitative visualization {{and analysis of the}} intricate vortex topology and vortex dynamics. The aim of the study is the exploration of the near wake of the <b>step</b> <b>cylinder,</b> focusing on the region of stepwise discontinuity. Considering history of the investigations for this geometry, there is no study available for this range of Reynolds number, and this range of the diameter ratios. For the range of the parameters investigated, turbulent vortex shedding occurs in the single-step cylinder wake. Thus, the investigations will put more insight into the flow development in the wake of this bluff body. The results showed that distinct spanwise vortex cells form in the <b>step</b> <b>cylinder</b> wake: a single vortex shedding cell {{in the wake of the}} small cylinder, and one vortex shedding cell in the wake of the large cylinder. However, in the wake of the large cylinder wake an interaction region is also introduced. The difference in the diameters leads to a variation in the vortex shedding frequency, which introduces intricate three-dimensional vortex interactions in the wake of the <b>step</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Once in a while, the vortex shedding becomes out of phase, which introduces a dislocation at the boundary of two cells. The dislocation is exhibited by a half-loop connection, in which two vortices within the same cell connect to each other. Results showed that there is no significant Reynolds number effect on the average spanwise extent of the vortex cells and the transition region between neighboring cells. However, it was found that in such a high Reynolds number streamwise vortices are introduced into the wake which complicates the vortex dynamic, and vortex interactions.

Since simulations allow isolating the different affecting factors, they form a useful complement to experimental investigations. Dewulf et. al [5] investigated the influence of beam hardening correction parameters on the diameter of a calibrated steel pin in different experimental set-ups.

40|$|A new {{loading and}} {{discharge}} concept for ships, {{referred to as}} the Universal Buoyancy Concept (UBC), is proposed as an effective alternative to land based infrastructure for distribution of primarily LNG. The UBC system consists of a slack moored stepped spar buoy equipped with pads for shipside vacuum attachment. The buoy is connected to shore based tank facilities with a flexible cryogenic riser, thus providing opportunity for offshore loading and discharge of cryogenic liquids. In the following masters thesis, some hydrodynamic aspects of the UBC has been investigated with experimental methods. The model tests have been done in collaboration with fellow classmate Andreas Nilsen. A model test specification was prepared, where the objectives of the test and a detailed test plan was formulated. A model of the UBC was produced partially by MARINTEK and partially by Andreas and myself. A ship model was provided by MARINTEK and ballasted to a light loading condition for conservative ship motions. A rigid coupling arrangement between the ship and the buoy with possibility for measurement of interaction forces were installed in the ship model. Static pull-out tests for adjustment of a simple spring mooring system and decay tests were performed. Subsequently 4 headings were tested for regular waves and current. Afterwards, post-processing and analysis of the results has been conducted from scratch in Matlab. Results in this masters thesis consist of RAO&# 146;s of first order motions and interaction forces between UBC and the ship for coupled condition, RAO&# 146;s for independent and relative motion, estimation of current drag forces &# 150;and moments on UBC (including ship shadow effects), current forces on the coupled system, mean wave drift forces, and vortex induced vibrations on UBC. More information can be worked out from the results if needed. Head sea current gives the largest drag forces &# 150;and moments on UBC in coupled condition. Transverse current moments on UBC will be smallest with UBC placed downstream of the ship. Drag coefficients from measured mean drag moments are lower than those for a smooth circular cylinder in the same Reynolds number regime, though existing experimental results for <b>stepped</b> <b>cylinders</b> and cylinders with free end reports an increase in drag coefficient for these shapes compared to a smooth circular cylinder. It is speculated if the transducer is not sufficiently sensitive to the small force regime. Wave drift forces are considerable for beam sea conditions, nearly the same magnitude as current forces. For longer waves, the head sea condition is expected to be most critical with regard to wave drift depending on the ship size. Experimental values of drift forces are generally larger than conservatively predicted with Maruo&# 146;s formula (total reflection). It is crucial to model exact mass distribution for accurate results of linear motions of UBC. A reduction in mass radius of gyration from 12. 9 m to 7. 12 m gives order of magnitude tripled linear roll/pitch motions of UBC, and the natural roll/pitch period is reduced is reduced with 10 seconds, from 25. 8 to 15. 8 seconds. For the considered ship size, ship motions dominate UBC motions, especially in heave. Both horizontal and vertical relative motions are sharply increasing with wave period. Relative motion between UBC and ship is significantly smaller with UBC positioned on the leeward side of the ship, with horizontal motion halved for wave frequencies of 1. 3 rad/s. Moderate crossflow excitation forces at the theoretical vortex shedding frequency of the top cylinder are registered for current speeds of 0. 2 m/s (model scale). Hence top cylinder vortex shedding is assumed to dominate the crossflow forces. For model scale current speeds of 0. 3 m/s, crossflow excitation forces become powerful, and seem to lock on to the roll frequency of the ship. For lower current velocities, the natural roll period of UBC will be excited. Scaling of crossflow forces is difficult due to uncertainty in both Strouhals number and wake development for a <b>stepped</b> <b>cylinder</b> with free end at full scale Reynolds numbers. Beam sea conditions are the most critical condition with regard to first order ship-buoy reaction forces, and of the two, UBC on the windward side will be the worst. On the leeward side UBC is protected against both incoming and reflected waves. Ship roll motions are larger with UBC on the leeward side, suggesting that the dominating phenomenon contributing to reaction forces are inertia forces from the surface waves, not drag forces from ship-induced forced linear motions of UBC. It is acknowledged that forces and especially moments are over-estimated due to the rigid coupling. Fourier analysis of time series has revealed second order effects at twice the wave frequency in a majority of both interaction force and motion measurements. The wave profile is investigated and found to display similar, but less significant second order effects. It is believed that a second order wave profile develops from a first order as it travels down the tank. In retrospect, a Fourier analysis of the wave profile at the location of the test setup and closer to the wavemaker could be conducted as part of the calibration of environments. </p...|$|R

This yields a characterization of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for several transformations arising from irrational rotations and <b>step</b> functions: <b>cylinder</b> flows, special flows, induced maps [...] . From there we give constructions of special flows and three-interval exchange transformations with unusual spectral properties. In both cases we exhibit examples with Kronecker factors of infinite rank. We also construct three-interval exchange transformations which are non-trivially conjugate to irrational rotations or to odometers. Similarly there exist special flows over irrational rotations which are non-trivially conjugate to translations flows on T^ 2 or on solenoids. Finally, we prove a regularization property which allows us to give similar examples of special flows with smooth ceiling functions, under natural Diophantine conditions for the rotation.

40|$|Reliability of a {{piston rod}} {{position}} measurement system is key {{when applied to}} large hydraulic cylinders. This and other requirements {{lead to the development}} of the CIMS (Cylinder Integrated Measurement System), a contactless and highly accurate system that uses the Hall effect to detect an encoded piston rod. To eliminate deviations caused by mechanical tolerances, temperature and air gap variations etc., the raw signals are filtered and compensated. Its functionality has been extended by making statistical data available, based on the values measured. These include the number of strokes, cumulative stroke length, stroke length distribution, maximum velocity and acceleration, temperature classification and extreme temperatures. Assessment of these data enables the user to optimize his application. Comparison to historic data can give input to the preventive maintenance plan to reduce (unforeseeable) system downtime and to increase the system reliability. This development resulted into the CIMSmart. It is a significant <b>step</b> towards <b>cylinder</b> intelligence...|$|R

40|$|A {{high-resolution}} {{method has}} been developed for the determination of localized values of interfacial reaction rate and mass transfer coefficient in aqueous solution. Scanning electron microscopy has been successfully applied to this problem through the measurement of electroplated film thickness formed under limiting current conditions. The method involves the calculation of local values of reaction rate via Faraday 2 ̆ 7 s laws and subsequent conversion of the data to absolute values of mass transfer coefficient. The technique has been verified in an undisturbed, turbulent flow regime (rotating cylinder electrode) {{through the use of}} Sherwood group dimensionless analysis. The resulting relationship shows comparable accuracy relative to electrochemical measurements. Favourable comparison has also been made with the generally accepted rotating cylinder correlation of Eisenberg, Tobias and Wilke. Differential rates of mass transfer to a single surface under conditions of disturbed flow have also been examined at a high spatial resolution using the <b>stepped</b> rotating <b>cylinder</b> electrode geometry. In this case, reaction rates have been measured as a function of circumferential distance within a recirculation zone situated immediately downstream of a backward-facing step...|$|R

Foundry cores are granular materials made of sand grains aggregated with binder bridges. In the cold box coring process, the binder is a polyurethane resin. It is noteworthy that during the casting of the liquid metal, the polymer binder is seriously damaged. This kind of materials has been poorly investigated so far. This study aims for {{a better understanding of}} the mechanical behaviour and fracture of cores subjected to various loads and thermal ageing. Particularly, the focus is on the decoring step, which consists in removing the sand by hammering and vibration of the metallic part after casting.

40|$|Although viral vector-mediated {{delivery}} of glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) {{to the brain}} has considerable potential as a neuroprotective strategy in Parkinson's disease (PD), its ability to protect complex motor functions relevant to the human condition {{has yet to be}} established. In this study, we used an operant task that assesses the selection, initiation and execution of lateralized nose-pokes in Lister Hooded rats to assess the efficacy with which complex behaviours are protected against neurotoxic lesions by prior injection of a lentiviral vector expressing GDNF. Unilateral injection of 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) into the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) caused rats to attempt fewer trials and to make more procedural errors. Lesioned rats also developed a pronounced ipsilateral bias, with a corresponding drop in contralateral accuracy. They were also slower to react to contralateral stimuli and to execute movements bilaterally. Rats that were pre-treated 4 weeks prior to lesion surgery with an equine infectious anaemia virus (EIAV) vector carrying GDNF [EIAV-GDNF, injected into the striatum and above the substantia nigra (SN) ] performed significantly better on all of these parameters than control rats. In addition to the operant task, EIAV-GDNF successfully rescued contralateral impairments in the corridor, staircase, <b>stepping</b> and <b>cylinder</b> tasks, and prevented drug-induced rotational asymmetry. This study confirms that GDNF can protect against 6 -OHDA-induced impairments in complex as well as simple behaviours, and reinforces the use of EIAV-based vectors for the treatment of PD...|$|R
