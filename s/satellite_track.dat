50|$|The ESMR {{instrument}} only senses horizontally {{polarized radiation}} at a frequency of 19 GHz, {{and can be}} used to calculate sea ice concentration. However, results are difficult to intercompare to SMMR / SSMI. The ESMR scanned along the <b>satellite</b> <b>track,</b> leading {{to a wide range of}} incident angles; SMMR scanned with a constant angle of 50 degrees, allowing both horizontally and vertically polarised data to be received; SMMR also had 5 instead of one channels, leading to improved sea ice retrievals.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} achieve this {{accuracy}} while viewing the Earth's surface through the atmosphere, AATSR views the surface at two angles, one close to the nadir (immediately below the satellite) and the other along the <b>satellite</b> <b>track</b> at close to 55° from the nadir, thereby providing two views of each point on the Earth's surface, each with a different effective atmospheric thickness.

(The <b>satellite</b> <b>track</b> is repeated about every 10 days and so M2 tidal signals are shifted to longer periods due to aliasing.) The longest internal tide wavelengths are about 150 km near Hawaii and the next longest waves are about 75 km long.

50|$|The Cospas-Sarsat {{system was}} made {{possible}} by Doppler processing. Local unit terminals (LUTs) detecting non-geostationary satellites interpret the Doppler frequency shift heard by LEOSAR and MEOSAR satellites as they pass over a beacon transmitting at a fixed frequency. The interpretation determines both bearing and range. The range and bearing are measured from the rate of change of the heard frequency, which varies both according to the path of the satellite in space and the rotation of the earth. This triangulates the position of the beacon. A faster change in the doppler indicates that the beacon is closer to the satellite's orbit. If the beacon is moving toward or away from the <b>satellite</b> <b>track</b> due to the Earth's rotation, it is on one side or other of the satellite's path. Doppler shift is zero at the closest point of approach between the beacon and the orbit.|$|E

From the mathematical calculations, it is possible to determine both [...] bearing and [...] range with respect to the satellite. The range and bearing are measured from the rate of change of the received frequency, which varies both according to the path of the satellite in space and the rotation of the Earth.

When the beacon is moving toward or away from the <b>satellite</b> <b>track</b> due to the Earth's rotation, the Doppler shift induced by that motion also can be used in the calculation.|$|E
