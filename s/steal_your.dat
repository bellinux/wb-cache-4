500|$|Mustaine has {{elaborated}} on {{the subject}} matter of several of the album's other songs as well. He has noted that [...] "Forget to Remember" [...] was intentionally written in an ambiguous way so that it could interpreted as being about either a person trying to forget about a relationship or someone who suffers from Alzheimer's disease and has memory problems. He also compared the concept behind the song to the film The Notebook. [...] "The Blackest Crow" [...] has a Southern influence and features a slide guitar, while the lyrics are about loss and subsequent depression. Mustaine initially hoped to have a guest feature on the song, and reached out to country musicians Willie Nelson and Miranda Lambert; however, neither appeared on the song. [...] "Don't Turn Your Back..." [...] was inspired by a friend of Mustaine, who described him as [...] "the kind of guy that will <b>steal</b> <b>your</b> dope and then help you look for it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Writing in The Times, Henry Raynor {{struggled}} to characterise their music: [...] "It {{is not a}} pop group, not a folk group and not a jazz group, but what it attempts is music which is a synthesis of all these and other styles as well as interesting experiments in each of them individually." [...] Even Pentangle's earliest work is characterised by that synthesis of styles. Songs such as [...] "Bruton Town" [...] and [...] "Let No Man <b>Steal</b> <b>Your</b> Thyme" [...] from 1968's The Pentangle include elements of folk, jazz, blues, and early music. Pete Townshend described their sound as [...] "fresh and innovative." [...] By the release of their fourth album, Cruel Sister, in 1970, Pentangle had moved closer to traditional folk music and begun using electric guitars. By this time, folk music had itself moved towards rock {{and the use of}} electrified instruments, so Cruel Sister invited comparison with such works as Fairport Convention's Liege and Lief and Steeleye Span's Hark! The Village Wait. Pentangle is thus often described as one of the progenitors of British folk rock.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Unesco Courier, anthropologist and social theorist Mark Anspach (editor of the René Girard issue of Les Cahiers de l'Herne) explains that Aglietta and Orléan (who were very critical of economic rationality) see the classical theory of economics as a myth. According to Anspach, the vicious circle of violence and vengeance generated by mimetic rivalry gives rise to the gift economy, as a means to overcome it and achieve a peaceful reciprocity: [...] "Instead of waiting for your neighbour to come <b>steal</b> <b>your</b> yams, you offer them to him today, and it is up to him {{to do the same for}} you tomorrow. Once you have made a gift, he is obliged to make a return gift. Now you have set in motion a positive circularity." [...] Since the gift may be so large as to be humiliating, a second stage of development—"economic rationality"—is required: this liberates the seller and the buyer of any other obligations than to give money. Thus reciprocal violence is eliminated by the sacrifice, obligations of vengeance by the gift, and finally the possibly dangerous gift by [...] "economic rationality." [...] This rationality, however, creates new victims, as globalization is increasingly revealing.|$|E
