500|$|Enron used {{special purpose}} entities—limited {{partnerships}} or companies created {{to fulfill a}} temporary or specific purpose to fund or manage risks associated with <b>specific</b> <b>assets.</b> The company elected to disclose minimal details on its use of [...] "special purpose entities". These shell companies were created by a sponsor, but funded by independent equity investors and debt financing. For financial reporting purposes, a series of rules dictate whether a special purpose entity is a separate entity from the sponsor. In total, by 2001, Enron had used hundreds of special purpose entities to hide its debt. Enron used a number of special purpose entities, such as partnerships in its Thomas and Condor tax shelters, financial asset securitization investment trusts (FASITs) in the Apache deal, real estate mortgage investment conduits (REMICs) in the Steele deal, and REMICs and {{real estate investment trusts}} (REITs) in the Cochise deal.|$|E
50|$|Originally asset {{specificity}} {{is proposed}} mainly in a buyer-seller situation, where the buyer {{is the party}} that does not hold the <b>specific</b> <b>assets</b> and the seller is the party that holds the <b>specific</b> <b>assets.</b> For example, in Williamson's (1983) model, the hold-up is unilateral: the buyer holds up the seller. However later researchers have realized that asset specificity could be bilateral, or even multi-lateral. For example Joskow (1988) and Klein (1988) noted that even in a traditional buyer-seller situation, the hold up is bilateral because the buyer (the party that does not hold the <b>specific</b> <b>assets)</b> has exit cost associated with time and searching investment {{if he decides to}} switch party.|$|E

50|$|In Canada, a {{debenture}} {{refers to}} a secured loan instrument where security is generally over the debtor's credit, but security is not pledged to <b>specific</b> <b>assets.</b> Like other secured debts, the debenture gives the debtor priority status over unsecured creditors in a bankruptcy; however debt instruments where security is pledged to <b>specific</b> <b>assets</b> (such as a bond) receive a higher priority status in a bankruptcy than do debentures.|$|E
50|$|Selective {{revaluation}} can {{be defined}} as revaluation of <b>specific</b> <b>assets</b> within a class or all assets within a specific location.|$|E

50|$|These are {{commercial}} organisations {{that traditionally}} specialise {{in the management}} of <b>specific</b> <b>asset</b> management products in <b>specific</b> <b>asset</b> classes. Some of those have evolved to offer a 'total solution', including advisory services. They in turn can be divided into three groups: a) diversified asset managers with expertise in a broad range of asset classes, b) multi-managers, and c) (liability) hedging specialists. Leading examples in the first group include AXA, Blackrock, Goldman Sachs, ING, Kempen and Robeco - Corestone while Russell Investments and SEI are leading examples of the second group. Cardano {{is an example of the}} third group.|$|R
50|$|Exposure factor (EF) is the subjective, {{potential}} {{percentage of}} loss to a <b>specific</b> <b>asset</b> if a <b>specific</b> threat is realized. The exposure factor is a subjective value {{that the person}} assessing risk must define.|$|R
5000|$|Regulatory reasons: A {{special-purpose}} entity {{can sometimes}} be set up within an orphan structure to circumvent regulatory restrictions, such as regulations relating to nationality of ownership of <b>specific</b> <b>assets.</b>|$|E
50|$|In asset {{protection}} arrangements, ring-fencing {{can be employed}} through segregating <b>specific</b> <b>assets</b> and liabilities into separate companies of a corporate group. It {{can also be used}} as a method for mitigating liquidation risk or to improve a corporate credit rating.|$|E
50|$|A {{manufacturing}} company may have its manufacturing facilities spread over different locations. Suppose it decides {{to undertake a}} revaluation of its plant & machinery. Selective revaluation will mean revaluing <b>specific</b> <b>assets</b> (such as boiler, heater, central air-conditioning system) at all locations, or revaluing all items of Plant & Machinery at a particular location only. Such revaluation will lead to unrepresentative amounts being shown in the Fixed Assets Register (FAR). In case of revaluation of <b>specific</b> <b>assets</b> of a class, while some assets will be shown at a revalued amount others will be shown at historic cost. The same will happen in case of revaluation of all assets of plant & machinery at a particular location only.|$|E
50|$|There {{is a major}} {{stream of}} {{analysis}} stories which pool comments from fund managers to build a market view of <b>specific</b> <b>asset</b> classes, regions or sectors. These items are also split out into a separate section.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the case}} of loans or bonds, ringfencing {{generally}} allows an investor to have both a link to a <b>specific</b> <b>asset</b> they possess (such as wind farms owned by a utility), while also enjoying the full credit support of a utility's balance sheet.|$|R
30|$|The {{examples}} regarding financial bubbles {{are usually}} obtained by showing <b>specific</b> <b>asset</b> dynamics with strict local martingale behavior. We give here {{an example of}} a bubble in uncertainty setting by focusing our attention on the choice of probability measures considered in the uncertainty framework.|$|R
50|$|The {{agreement}} also, {{much like}} a prenuptial agreement, allows the individuals concerned to determine in advance who will keep <b>specific</b> <b>assets</b> {{and what will happen}} to assets that have been purchased jointly if they separate. This agreement is intended to bind both parties.|$|E
50|$|In finance, {{unsecured}} debt refers to {{any type of}} debt or general obligation that is not protected by a guarantor, or collateralized by a lien on <b>specific</b> <b>assets</b> of the borrower {{in the case of}} a bankruptcy or liquidation or failure to meet the terms for repayment.|$|E
50|$|PDPs acts as ‘conductors of {{a virtual}} orchestra’, {{leveraging}} partners’ <b>specific</b> <b>assets,</b> capacities, and expertise to implement projects at {{all stages of}} the R&D process, integrating capabilities from academia; public-sector research institutions, particularly in neglected disease-endemic countries; pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies; non-governmental organizations including other PDPs; and governments worldwide.|$|E
50|$|Demand {{for storage}} space remains stable as of Q4 2015. The supply for {{self-storage}} is also relatively stable. Often, {{the process to}} build a new storage building is onerous and can take years. Additionally, this <b>specific</b> <b>asset</b> class often gets push back from communities, due to its nature.|$|R
50|$|On the {{acceptance}} of a legacy, a legatee obtains a vested right to claim from the executor delivery of the <b>specific</b> <b>asset</b> bequeathed to him or her, or registration {{in the case of}} immovable property; this claim is enforceable only when the liquidation and distribution account has been confirmed.|$|R
50|$|Information cascades {{have become}} one of the topics of {{behavioral}} economics, as they are often seen in financial markets where they can feed speculation and create cumulative and excessive price moves, either for the whole market (market bubble...) or a <b>specific</b> <b>asset,</b> like a stock that becomes overly popular among investors.|$|R
5000|$|Leveraged Capital {{assets were}} used to provide {{collateral}} to the Riqueza account. (The <b>specific</b> <b>assets</b> mentioned in evidence were the Coeur d'Alene Mines shares which Norm Seckold had lodged with Leveraged Capital as security for his borrowings from Leveraged Capital.) The first time this occurred was in June 2006.|$|E
5000|$|Tranches {{with either}} a second lien or no lien are often {{referred}} to as [...] "junior notes". These are more risky investments because they are not secured by <b>specific</b> <b>assets.</b> The natural buyers of these securities tend to be hedge funds and other investors seeking higher risk/return profiles.|$|E
5000|$|A unit of {{account in}} {{financial}} accounting refers to the words {{that are used to}} describe the <b>specific</b> <b>assets</b> and liabilities that are reported in financial statements rather than the units used to measure them. [...] Unit of account and unit of measure are sometimes treated as synonyms in financial accounting and economics.|$|E
50|$|The {{result is}} a {{monetary}} value in the same unit as the single-loss expectancy is expressed (euros, dollars, yens, etc.):exposure factor is the subjective, potential percentage of loss to a <b>specific</b> <b>asset</b> if a <b>specific</b> threat is realized. The exposure factor is a subjective value that the person assessing risk must define.|$|R
5000|$|In {{times when}} there are {{dramatic}} flows into or out of a <b>specific</b> <b>asset,</b> there can be disparate pricings on products that are, for all economic purposes, identical. The FI-RV Investor can capture these inefficiencies by combining bonds, swaps, options, currencies and/or futures into products that replicate another product in every sense.|$|R
25|$|Secured and {{unsecured}} creditors {{constitute the}} creditor body. Both secured and unsecured creditors {{are ahead of}} shareholders as noted earlier. A secured creditor is a creditor, who has a priority claim on an asset or assets of a company. A lien on the <b>specific</b> <b>asset</b> or assets places the secured creditor's claim ahead of the unsecured creditor. Once a secured creditor is satisfied, the unsecured creditor is then the next priority. This is again the normal order of priority in a bankruptcy.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{difficulty}} for AFI is the long-term behavior of its participants. Although basic financial skills courses are mandatory for those involved, and AFI does succeed in helping many save for <b>specific</b> <b>assets,</b> the [...] "culture of poverty" [...] still permeates these individuals. For example, 64 percent of IDA holders made an unmatched withdrawal.|$|E
50|$|Many jurisdictions permit <b>specific</b> <b>assets</b> to be mortgaged without {{transferring}} {{title to}} the assets to the mortgagee. Principally, statutory mortgages relate to land, registered aircraft and registered ships. Generally speaking, the mortgagee {{will have the same}} rights as they would have had under a traditional true legal mortgage, but the manner of enforcement is usually regulated by the statute.|$|E
50|$|The unit of {{account in}} {{financial}} accounting refers to the words {{that are used to}} describe the <b>specific</b> <b>assets</b> and liabilities that are reported in financial statements rather than the units used to measure them. That is, {{unit of account}} refers to the object of recognition or display whereas unit of measure refers to the tool for measuring it.|$|E
40|$|Prognostics of a <b>specific</b> <b>asset</b> {{based on}} data from a fleet of same assets, but {{operated}} in different environmental and operational conditions is an important and common problem in Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). Traditional data-driven models trained on all fleet data provide only a general degradation trend, without capturing the specificity of the degradation process of the different assets. A two-step data-driven framework is here proposed to tackle this problem. A general model is trained traditionally on all fleet data and a correction model is built to estimate the deviation of the general model outcome from the degradation process of the <b>specific</b> <b>asset</b> of interest. The proposed framework is tested on a case study concerning the failure of a pneumatic valve in a nuclear power plant. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed two-step, data-driven framework...|$|R
50|$|The Asset Standards include {{requirements}} {{related to}} <b>specific</b> types of <b>assets.</b> These requirements must be followed {{in conjunction with}} the General Standards when performing a valuation of a <b>specific</b> <b>asset</b> type. The Asset Standards include certain background information on the characteristics of each asset type that influence value and additional asset-specific requirements on common valuation approaches and methods used. The Asset Standards are IVS 200 Business and Business Interests, IVS 210 Intangible Assets, IVS 300 Plant and Equipment, IVS 400 Real Property Interests, IVS 410 Development Property and IVS 500 Financial Instruments.|$|R
50|$|As {{with any}} investment, it’s {{important}} to do your homework, {{but in the case}} of many alternative investments, some specialist knowledge on the <b>specific</b> <b>asset</b> is often needed. Therefore, it’s important that would-be investors have a reputable broker or investment company on their side with demonstrable success in their asset class arena, which are happy to work with you to identify your ideal investment solutions.|$|R
