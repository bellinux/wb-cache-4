50|$|Since <b>Swedish</b> <b>Telecom</b> had a {{monopoly}} on telecommunications and the radio spectrum, a conflict arose between Televerket and Comvik.

Comvik had to expand into cell-based technology that today forms the basis of mobile telephony. The Swedish-based Ericsson sold no equipment to Comvik who instead had to develop the technology themselves using a mixture of suppliers. Comvik built up a customer base of 20,000 subscribers. In order to compete with Televerket they had a lower per-minute rate and offered free calls on evenings and weekends. Comvik also launched several value added services aiming at small businesses.|$|E
