25|$|The transbay tube terminates at an under-bay <b>slip</b> <b>joint</b> {{near the}} Embarcadero Station in San Francisco. The {{designed}} slip margin {{has been reduced}} by half due to unforeseen settlement of the tube structure. The projected worst-case motion at this joint has been determined to be beyond that for which the joint is presently capable, which could cause severe structural problems and mud and water entry into the tube and adjacent subway systems. This is to be corrected at great expense – first estimated at $142 million but expected to cost far more – probably the largest single cost item {{in the list of}} BART seismic retrofits.|$|E
25|$|Linerlock {{mechanisms}} are most commonly composed of titanium alloy or steel. The linerlock's locking side liner is split {{from the top}} toward the bottom, similar to an automotive leaf spring (also called a lock bar) that butts up against the tang of the blade to prevent the blade from closing. In an interview with Blade in 1988, Walker stated, “This long leaf-spring effect cuts down on stress on the locking mechanism". As the lock on the original electrician's knife was mostly to hold a screwdriver blade open (the knife blade, itself was secured by a <b>slip</b> <b>joint</b> method), Walker's refinements prevented the knife blade from closing on the user's hand and converted it into a true lock.|$|E
50|$|<b>Slip</b> <b>joints</b> are {{sometimes}} found in tubular {{structures such as}} piping, but are generally avoided for this application due to requirements for sealing against leakage, instead using either a large loop that is allowed to flex or a semi-rigid bellows. <b>Slip</b> <b>joints</b> are used when the main problem is a large axial movement. Pipe supports often are <b>slip</b> <b>joints</b> {{to allow for the}} thermal expansion or contraction of the pipe relative to the support.|$|R

50|$|<b>Slip</b> <b>joints</b> can be {{designed}} to allow continuous relative motion of two components or it can allow an adjustment from one temporarily fixed position to another. Examples of the latter are tripods, hiking poles, or similar telescoping device. The position is fixed using a clamping mechanism based on a cam, a set screw or similar locking mechanism. <b>Slip</b> <b>joints</b> can also be non-telescoping, such as the joints on some older wooden surveyor's levelling rods. These use a joint that keeps the sections offset from each other but able to be slid together for transport.|$|R
25|$|The Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct, which {{supplies}} 270 to 315 {{million gallons}} of water per day to the City of San Francisco and other Bay Area communities, directly crosses the Hayward Fault in Fremont. A 2002 report by the Bay Area Economic Forum suggests that a breakdown in the aqueduct due to an earthquake could cut off Hetch Hetchy water to the Bay Area for 60 days. In addition to depriving 85% of San Francisco residents of their drinking water, this would cut off supplies for firefighting and water-intensive industry, causing economic damage of $17.2–28.7 billion. Extensive reconstruction work at the Hayward Fault crossing includes a multi-sectioned tunnel structure to allow shear without collapse, this is to contain a section of water pipe with ball joints and a <b>slip</b> <b>joint.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Medical Treatment and Care Building {{included}} a basement level that was exposed (above grade) {{on the east}} and south sides, mixed (above and below grade) on the west side, and below grade {{on the north side}} of the building, due to the shallow slope at the site. The complete structure, including the four external stairways, could be considered five separate buildings, since the stair towers were detached from the main building by about four inches. Earthquake bracing used in the building's second through fifth floors consisted of shear walls, but a rarely used <b>slip</b> <b>joint</b> technique used with the concrete walls at the first floor level excluded them from being used with that system. Damage to the building (including ceiling tiles, telephone equipment, and elevator doors) was described as excessive at the basement and first floor levels, with little damage further up. The difference in rigidity at the second floor was proposed as a cause of the considerable damage to the lower levels. As a result of the first floor nearly collapsing, the building was leaning to the north by nearly two feet, and three of the four concrete stair towers fell away from the main building.|$|E
25|$|A tube of {{particular}} structural, seismic, economic, and political {{interest is the}} BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) transbay tube. This tube was constructed {{at the bottom of}} San Francisco Bay through an innovative process. Rather than pushing a shield through the soft bay mud, the tube was constructed on land in sections. Each section consisted of two inner train tunnels of circular cross section, a central access tunnel of rectangular cross section, and an outer oval shell encompassing the three inner tubes. The intervening space was filled with concrete. At the bottom of the bay a trench was excavated and a flat bed of crushed stone prepared to receive the tube sections. The sections were then floated into place and sunk, then joined with bolted connections to previously-placed sections. An overfill was then placed atop the tube to hold it down. Once completed from San Francisco to Oakland, the tracks and electrical components were installed. The predicted response of the tube during a major earthquake was likened to be as that of a string of (cooked) spaghetti in a bowl of gelatin dessert. To avoid overstressing the tube due to differential movements at each end, a sliding <b>slip</b> <b>joint</b> was included at the San Francisco terminus under the landmark Ferry Building.|$|E
40|$|Load-bearing masonry {{buildings}} {{are composed of}} concrete slabs and supporting masonry walls, and in Australia usually incorporate <b>slip</b> <b>joints</b> in the interfaces between walls and slabs for serviceability reasons. The apparent conflicting requirements of the <b>slip</b> <b>joints,</b> to <b>slip</b> under long-term loads and to transmit short-term loading from wind and earthquake actions, together {{with the lack of}} attention to the design of <b>slip</b> <b>joints,</b> make <b>slip</b> in the <b>joints</b> likely to occur when the building is subjected to a lateral loading. <b>Joint</b> <b>slip</b> leads to a redistribution of loading in the building wall system, resulting in wall shear loads different from that determined using the current standard elastic design procedures. Redistribution of loading may be also caused by softening of the masonry. This paper has assessed the realistic response of various load-bearing masonry buildings, including the potential for <b>slip</b> in the <b>joints</b> and softening of the masonry, and evaluated the level of wall shear load deviations resulting from the application of current design procedures. Analyses of the buildings, using non-linear static and dynamic finite element models, have indicated that <b>joint</b> <b>slip</b> may occur in buildings subjected to earthquake loading. The application of current elastic design procedures, which do not account for loading redistribution, resulted in major wall shear load deviations, such as overestimations of up to + 75 % and underestimations of up to - 62 %. It was therefore concluded that improvements in the current design procedures are required for a more accurate evaluation of wall shear loads in load-bearing masonry buildings subjected to the lateral loading...|$|R
50|$|Log houses which settle require <b>slip</b> <b>joints</b> {{over all}} window and door openings, {{adjustable}} jacks under vertical elements (such as columns and staircases) which must periodically be adjusted as the building settles, allowances in plumbing, wiring, and ducting runs, and fasteners for the walls themselves to prevent uplift.|$|R
40|$|Loadbearing masonry {{construction}} is a building system composed of masonry walls and concrete slabs, with the masonry walls supporting the slabs and {{acting as the}} main structural element resisting the lateral loads from wind and earthquake. In Australian practice, these buildings usually incorporate <b>slip</b> <b>joints,</b> which are placed between the unreinforced masonry walls and concrete slabs, to allow for long term differential movements between {{the walls and the}} slabs. In some areas they also serve as a membrane type damp-proof-course. Loadbearing masonry buildings are often composed of reinforced concrete slabs and supporting masonry walls arranged in a cellular pattern. In Australia, these buildings usually incorporate <b>slip</b> <b>joints</b> in the interfaces between walls and slabs, to allow for long term relative displacements caused by brick growth, concrete shrinkage, and thermal expansion and contraction. A common application of this technique is for ''walk up" apartment buildings up to five storeys [Page (2002) ]. In this system of building, wind and earthquake actions are resisted by the floor slab acting as horizontal diaphragm in conjunction with the loadbearing walls. The load path therefore includes the <b>slip</b> <b>joints</b> at the wall-floor interface. The distribution of those actions among the walls of that building initially depends on the elastic stiffness and arrangement of the walls. However, once either softening of masonry or <b>slip</b> in the <b>joints</b> occurs, a redistribution of shear loads will result. The redistribution of shear is a complex process and is influenced by many factors, such as the nonlinear behaviour of masonry and <b>slip</b> <b>joints,</b> the compressive stress level in the walls, and the walls arrangement [Sing-Sang et al. (2006) ]. In asymmetrical buildings, the centre of mass does not coincide with the centre of wall stiffness. Hence, the lateral loading action tends to twist the building, and causes an increase of shear in the walls located at one side of the centre of stiffness, and a reduction of shear in the other walls. The building twisting also induces shear loading in the walls perpendicular to the lateral load direction. This behaviour may accelerate or delay the masonry softening and the <b>slip</b> in the <b>joints.</b> When either softening of masonry or <b>slip</b> in the <b>joints</b> occurs, the centre of wall stiffness will also change its position. Thus, during the loading process the effects of building torsion may change the shear distribution making the prediction of wall forces a very complex process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{structural}} integrity of a jet pump assembly of a {{boiling water reactor}} (BWR) under hydrodynamic loading was evaluated. This arrangement, which has a riser joined {{with a couple of}} jet pumps by the transition piece, is part of the reactor recirculation system. It is submerged in water under pressure. The main function is to induce forced flow through the core of the reactor. A dynamic structural analysis was carried out with the finite element method. The first ten modes of vibration and their natural frequencies were calculated. The first five natural frequencies are in the range between 25 Hz and 40 Hz. In this analysis, it was considered that the jet pump assembly is supported at the riser brace. The restrainer bracket keeps together the riser with the two jet pumps and there is free movement at the <b>slip</b> <b>joints...</b>|$|R
