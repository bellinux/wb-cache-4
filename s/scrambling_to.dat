5|$|On Cemetery Ridge, Generals Meade and Hancock were <b>scrambling</b> <b>to</b> find reinforcements. Meade {{had sent}} {{virtually}} all of his available troops (including most of the XII Corps, who would be needed momentarily on Culp's Hill) to his left flank to counter Longstreet's assault, leaving {{the center of his}} line relatively weak. There was insufficient infantry on Cemetery Ridge and only a few artillery pieces, rallied from the debacle of the Peach Orchard by Lt. Col. Freeman McGilvery.|$|E

In late 2013, the United States House of Representatives was considering a bill that would resume the funding and increase timber harvests to provide additional income to the counties.|$|E

It was later released to DVD on February 15, 2005. The miniseries focuses primarily on the city of Chicago as three unusual storm systems approach from the west, north and south and combine over the city to form a massive hurricane.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1814, the armies of the French Empire, under the direct command of Emperor Napoleon I, were <b>scrambling</b> <b>to</b> defend Eastern France against the invading Coalition Armies. Despite fighting against vastly superior forces, Napoleon managed to score a few significant victories and, between 10 and 13 February repeatedly beat Blücher’s Army of Silesia. On 13 February, reeling from his successive defeats, Blücher looked to disengage from Napoleon and instead manoeuvre with {{a part of his}} forces to fall upon the isolated VI Corps of Marshal Auguste de Marmont, who was defending Napoleon’s rear. The Prussian commander attacked and pushed back Marmont late on 13 February. Nevertheless, the Emperor had read into his enemy’s intentions and directed powerful forces to support Marmont.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Matsui's {{instructions}} {{said nothing}} about treatment of Chinese POWs. Matsui inadvertently contributed to the atrocity {{in a major way}} when he demanded on December 14 that his triumphal entrance into Nanking be scheduled for the early date of December 17. At the time his subordinates in Nanking objected because they were {{still in the process of}} <b>scrambling</b> <b>to</b> apprehend all the former Chinese soldiers hiding in the city and had no facilities in which to hold them. Regardless, Matsui held firm, and in many cases his men responded to the conundrum by ordering that all their prisoners be executed immediately after capture. Most of the large-scale massacres that took place within Nanking occurred in the days immediately prior to Matsui's entrance into the city.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{her return}} from Rome, Violante Beatrice and the Electress Anna Maria Luisa {{decided to do}} {{something}} about Gian Gastone's public image and the Ruspanti, his entourage. In order to distract him from the Ruspanti, Violante Beatrice threw banquets, to which she invited the foremost members of Tuscan society. The Grand Duke's behaviour, vomiting, belching and cracking rude jokes, literally sent the guests <b>scrambling</b> <b>to</b> leave. The Electress was more fortunate for her part. She succeeded in making Gian Gastone appear on Saint John the Baptist's day, 1729. However, during the ceremony, the Grand Duke became so intoxicated that he had to be dragged back to his palace, the Pitti, on a litter.|$|E

A pass to Avant and another scramble by Vick set the Eagles up at the 20-yard line at the two-minute warning. Facing second and three from the 13-yard line, Vick passed to Maclin on the left side, and Maclin shook a tackle from CB Terrell Thomas and reached the end zone, tying the game at 31–31 with 1:16 remaining.|$|E

25|$|Fifth Dimension {{can also}} be seen as a {{testament}} to the rapidity with which pop music was evolving during the mid-1960s. Like its predecessor, Turn! Turn! Turn!, the album was made under trying circumstances, with the band <b>scrambling</b> <b>to</b> compensate for the loss of their main songwriter in the wake of Clark's departure. This resulted in an uneven album that included a total of four cover versions and an instrumental. However, Fifth Dimension actually contained fewer covers than either of their Clark-era albums, as well as an absence of songs by Bob Dylan, whose material, along with Clark's, had dominated earlier Byrds releases.|$|E

25|$|Ewell {{began his}} {{demonstration}} at 4 p.m. upon hearing {{the sound of}} Longstreet's guns to the south. For three hours, he chose to limit his demonstration to an artillery barrage from Benner's Hill, about a mile (1,600 m) to the northeast. But despite this demonstration, Ewell did not hold the attention of Army of the Potomac commander, Maj. Gen. George G. Meade. Meade was occupied with the fierce fighting on his left flank and was <b>scrambling</b> <b>to</b> send as many reinforcements as possible. He ordered Slocum to send the XII Corps in support. It is unclear whether he ordered the entire corps or instructed Slocum to leave one brigade behind, but the latter is what Slocum did, and Greene's brigade was left with the sole responsibility for defending Culp's Hill.|$|E

25|$|Bryant {{then moved}} towards the coaches. One {{of the coach}} drivers, Royce Thompson, {{was shot in the}} back as he was moving along the passengers' side of a coach. He fell to the ground and was able to crawl, then roll under the bus to safety, but later died of his wounds. Brigid Cook was trying to guide a number of people down between the buses and along the jetty area to cover. Bryant moved to the front of this bus and walked across to the next coach. People had quickly moved from this coach towards the back end, in an attempt to seek cover. As Bryant walked around it, he saw people <b>scrambling</b> <b>to</b> hide and shot at them. Brigid Cook was shot in the right thigh, causing the bone to fragment, the bullet lodging there. A coach driver, Ian McElwee, was hit by {{fragments}} of Miss Cook's bone. Both were able to escape and survived.|$|E
25|$|Thompson was {{to provide}} Rolling Stone with {{coverage}} for the 1976 presidential campaign that would appear in a book published by the magazine. Reportedly, as Thompson was waiting for a $75,000 advance check to arrive, he learned that Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner had cancelled the assignment without informing him. Wenner then asked Thompson to travel to Vietnam to report on {{what appeared to be}} the closing of the Vietnam War. Thompson accepted, and left for Saigon immediately. He arrived with the country in chaos, just as South Vietnam was collapsing and other journalists were <b>scrambling</b> <b>to</b> find transportation out of the region. While there, Thompson learned that Wenner had pulled the plug on this excursion as well, and Thompson found himself in Vietnam without health insurance or additional financial support. Thompson's story about the fall of Saigon would not be published in Rolling Stone until ten years later. These two incidents severely strained the relationship between the author and the magazine, and Thompson contributed far less to the publication in later years.|$|E
25|$|At 1430 Vorse led {{the first}} CAP group to {{intercept}} bombers and fighter escorts {{making their way}} towards the U.S. carriers. Japanese Zero fighters effectively prevented Vorse and the men of his group—Register, Loesch and Sumrall—from engaging the incoming dive bombers, which by day's end would score three hits on Enterprise. The enemy fighters paid dearly for their actions, however: Vorse, Register and Sumrall each downed one {{by the end of}} the scrap. Out of both ammunition and gas by CAP's end, the men of Vorse's division were forced to land and refuel aboard Saratoga, with the notable exception of Vorse himself who could not even make it that far and plunked his bird down in the water off Saratogas stern. For the remainder of the day, Japanese air power was directed almost singly on Enterprise, with VF-6 <b>scrambling</b> <b>to</b> knock as many bombers off course and out of the sky as possible. By the end of action on 24 August, the fighter squadron claimed 13 Aichi 99 dive bombers and 10 Nagoya Zeros, among other miscellaneous aircraft.|$|E

25|$|Although Zhang was {{credited}} by the PLAAF for shooting down Davis' F-86, {{doubts about the}} claim were raised due to US Air Force's recollection of the event was inconsistent with Zhang's own account of the battle, and that Davis had claimed to have shot down two Chinese MiGs moments before being killed. The lack of gun camera footage from Chinese side meant Zhang's victory claim also hinged on his own recollection of the event. After declassifying their involvement in the Korean War 40 years later, Russian sources disputed Zhang's claim by raising the possibility that 1st Lieutenant Mikhail Akimovich Averin was the MiG pilot that had shot down Davis' plane. According to the recollections from the pilots of the Soviet 64th Aviation Corps, both Zhang and his wingman were probably shot down by Davis, who was in turn surprised and shot down by Mikhail A. Averin <b>scrambling</b> <b>to</b> save the Chinese MiGs. Lieutenant General Georgeii Lobov, commander of the 64th Aviation Corps, also noted in his memoir that Davis {{was killed by a}} Soviet pilot. Currently, both China and Russia have taken credit over Davis' death with no conclusive evidence to confirm either sides of the story.|$|E
500|$|The {{causes of}} the Peloponnesian War have been much debated, but many ancient historians lay the blame on Pericles and Athens. Plutarch seems to believe that Pericles and the Athenians incited the war, <b>scrambling</b> <b>to</b> {{implement}} their belligerent tactics [...] "with a sort of arrogance and a love of strife". Thucydides hints at the same thing, believing {{the reason for the}} war was Sparta's fear of Athenian power and growth. However, as he is generally regarded as an admirer of Pericles, Thucydides has been criticized for bias against Sparta.|$|E
