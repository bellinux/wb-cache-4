25|$|There {{have been}} some market-led {{initiatives}} to encourage packaging reuse by companies introducing refill packs of certain commodities (mainly <b>soap</b> <b>powders</b> and cleaning fluids), the contents being transferred before use into a reusable package kept by the customer, with the savings in packaging being passed onto the customer by lower shelf prices. The refill pack itself is not reused, but being a minimal package for carrying the product home, it requires less material than one with the durability and features (reclosable top, convenient shape, etc.) required for easy use of the product, while avoiding the transport cost and emissions of returning the reusable package to the factory.|$|E

40|$|In {{the early}} 1900 s, Unilever’s {{entry into the}} Australian soap market had to employ a {{takeover}} strategy to overcome the barrier to entry created by long established local manufacturers. This had led to the merging of Lever Brothers (Australia) and J. Kitchen & Sons resulting {{in the formation of}} Lever and Kitchen Pty. Ltd. in 1914. From 1920 ’s to 1950 ’s Lever and Kitchen dominated the Australian <b>soap</b> <b>powder</b> market with no serious challenger. Persil was positioned as a heavy duty <b>soap</b> <b>powder</b> which promised "extra whiteness" while Rinso's claim was a <b>soap</b> <b>powder</b> which gave "thicker, richer suds". The prevalent hand washing habit of that time favoured a gentler <b>soap</b> <b>powder</b> and Rinso became the market leader. Unilever, however, maintained a two-brand policy throughout this period. By the late 1940 ’s the laundry washing habits of the Australian housewives were undergoing a rapid revolution. The washing machine promised to liberate the housewives from their heavy workload in the laundry and eliminate the drudgery which had chained women to the house for centuries. Lever and Kitchen reacted to the changing usage habits by repositioning Rinso and Persil as "powders suitable for both hand-wash and machine-wash. " Rinso's market leadership was ensured by its advertising claim that all washing machine manufacturers recommended Rinso. Both brands continued to offer secondary benefits as a dishwashing agent. Lever and Kitchen continued to enjoy dominant market shares throughout the late 1940 ’s and early 1950 ’s...|$|R
5000|$|Rinso {{was one of}} {{the first}} mass-marketed <b>soap</b> <b>powders.</b> It was advertised widely on United States radio, being the sponsor of many radio {{programs}} such as the popular daytime soap opera Big Sister from 1936 to 1946, the dramatic anthology Grand Central Station from 1940 to 1942, the night-time programs Big Town from 1937 to 1942, Mayor of the Town from 1942 to 1943, and most notably The Amos 'n' Andy Show from 1943 to 1950. During this time the product's advertisements happily chanted the slogan [...] "Rinso white, Rinso bright" [...] and boasted that Rinso contained [...] "Solium, the sunlight ingredient". In 1936 the sponsored show Rinso Music Hall was recorded in London and broadcast on Radio Luxembourg and Radio Normandie, followed from 1937 to 1939 by the popular Rinso Radio Revue.|$|E

Out of 163 subjects with chronic bronchitis only six non-smokers were free of factors associated with pulmonary irritation. This evidence from non-smokers not exposed to air pollution adds further strength to the hypothesis that daily phlegm is caused by persistent inhalation of irritants...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Extraction of genomic DNA {{in humans}} {{is the first}} step for {{molecular}} genetic studies. Objective: To evaluate the success of genomic DNA extraction based on the technique of salting out from blood samples, comparing different membrane lysis reagents. Methods: Reagent Nonidet P- 40 and three homemade reagents were tested in different concentrations. We evaluated the concentration and purity of the DNA samples by spectrophotometry and its applicability in PCR techniques. Results: There was a large amount of DNA extracted using Nonidet P- 40 and <b>soap</b> <b>powder.</b> As {{to the quality of the}} DNA, Nonidet P- 40 yielded higher purity samples. After PCR, only the DNA extracted with Nonidet P- 40 showed satisfactory amplification. Conclusion: Nonidet P- 40 seems to be the most suitable reagent for use in molecular techniques, whereas <b>soap</b> <b>powder</b> may be suitable in molecular biology classroom settings...|$|R
