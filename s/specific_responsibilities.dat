500|$|The Inner Court was {{governed by}} a series of laws known as the Palace Laws (กฎมนเทียรบาล, Kot Monthien Ban; {{literally}} 'Palace Maintenance Law'). Some of the laws dated back to the times of the Kingdom of Ayutthaya. Most of them deal with the hierarchy and status of the women, while others deal with their behaviour and conduct. The order and discipline of the inhabitants were enforced by a regiment of all-female guards (กรมโขลน, Krom Klone; [...] ). These guards were described by Prince Chula Chakrabongse as [...] "tough looking amazons". The head of this body was known as the Atibodi Fai Nai (อธิบดีฝ่ายใน; [...] ) the directress of the inside, under her command were various officials. These officials had <b>specific</b> <b>responsibilities</b> concerning every facet of life within the Inner Court. These responsibilities included duties concerning: discipline and jails, the maintenance of Buddhist images, the guarding of gates, the inner treasury and expenditure. One of their main duties was to accompany men, once they were admitted into the area, and to remain with them until they left. They controlled the traffic of the court and were drilled like regular soldiers. When any person of importance passed along the streets they ran ahead and cleared the way for them. At night they patrolled the streets with lamps or torches. Misbehaviour or indiscretion on behalf of the wives was punishable by death, for the women and the man. The last such punishment was met out in 1859 to a young nobleman and a minor wife, who were having an affair.|$|E

2500|$|The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency {{encourages}} electronic recyclers {{to become}} certified by demonstrating to an accredited, independent third party auditor that they meet specific standards to safely recycle and manage electronics. [...] This should work {{so as to}} ensure the highest environmental standards are being maintained. [...] Two certifications for electronic recyclers currently exist and are endorsed by the EPA. [...] Customers are encouraged to choose certified electronics recyclers. [...] Responsible electronics recycling reduces environmental and human health impacts, increases the use of reusable and refurbished equipment and reduces energy use while conserving limited resources. The two EPA-endorsed certification programs are Responsible Recyclers Practices (R2) and E-Stewards. [...] Certified companies ensure they are meeting strict environmental standards which maximize reuse and recycling, minimize exposure to human health or the environment, ensure safe management of materials and require destruction of all data used on electronics. Certified electronics recyclers have demonstrated through audits and other means that they continually meet specific high environmental standards and safely manage used electronics. Once certified, the recycler is held to the particular standard by continual oversight by the independent accredited certifying body. A certification board accredits and oversees certifying bodies {{to ensure that they}} meet <b>specific</b> <b>responsibilities</b> and are competent to audit and provide certification.|$|E
2500|$|The {{distribution}} maps available above {{show that}} the abbey's assets were heavily concentrated, tending to form natural groups, in Shropshire. This was a major advantage that Haughmond had over nearby Lilleshall, which always suffered from the running costs associated with a widely dispersed property portfolio. The acquisition policy of the abbey tended to strengthen this advantage, deliberately buying or requesting grants of adjoining estates to increase local concentrations of land. Beyond Leebotswood, for example, the abbey built up a large composite of holdings. A grant by Henry II of meadow on the Long Mynd {{marked the beginning of}} the venture. More benefactors contributed, especially the powerful Robert Corbet of Caus Castle, and a substantial monastic estate took shape, known as [...] the “domain of Boveria”, from the Latin bos/bovis, an ox, and meaning roughly [...] "cattle shed". [...] This land along the Wales–England border, was mostly waste when the canons arrived but quickly became excellent pasture, as the new name suggests. It fell in the Diocese of Hereford and it was Bishop Robert Foliot who gave the canons permission to turn their oratory at Stitt, in Ratlinghope manor, into church for the region. After it acquired Aston Abbots, in the early 13th century, the community built up another large group of holdings east of Oswestry at Hisland, Twyford and West Felton, and Great Ness. Wherever estates adjoined uncultivated areas, the community took to vigorous assarting. This had been specifically allowed by Henry II in some of his grants. To make administration easier, the estates were divided into 12 local bailiwicks. These were generally under lay management, but obedientiaries, canons with <b>specific</b> <b>responsibilities</b> for rent and tithe collection, were deputed by the abbots to keep in touch.|$|E
