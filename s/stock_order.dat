On June 6, 1923, Fuller and McGee were sentenced to fifteen months to fours years, to begin serving in June 1927. That day, Judge Henry W.

40|$|With a {{decreasing}} {{market for}} trucks and low volumes of sales, {{service and maintenance}} has come to constitute {{an important source of}} income for truck manufacturers. A further tendency in the business is that the general interest in service quality, for instance within sales warranties and maintenance, has increased considerable. Hence, it has become extremely important to focus on handling and improving service quality. Nowadays, when the customer perceives little technical difference between competing offers, manufacturing companies need to create differential advantages through added value. For Scania Deutschland GmbH, this implies focusing on the customers, as well as improving the section of service and maintenance. An important factor within service and maintenance is to secure supply of spare-parts to the retailers. It has further been shown essential to maintain a stable inventory management at the central warehouse {{as well as at the}} retailers. Hence, the order routines must function smoothly. This thesis work is a product of the endeavour for lowering costs and improving the order process, with focus on the order placement between the retailers and the central warehouse. The aim for Scania Deutschland GmbH is to increase the orders placed on a daily basis, i. e daily <b>stock</b> <b>orders,</b> implying an increased inventory planning at the retailers. Consequently, the purpose of this thesis is to identify factors that restrain an increased level of daily <b>stock</b> <b>orders.</b> I have explored and described the order process at Scania Deutschland GmbH, and as a result identified factors that restrain the level of daily <b>stock</b> <b>orders.</b> The findings show that an increased level of daily orders would lower the transportation costs for Scania Deutschland GmbH. It can also be concluded that placing daily <b>stock</b> <b>orders</b> involve lower costs for the retailers than for other types of orders. A strict inventory control including control of problem spare-parts, together with a higher safety stock, will secure the supply of spare-parts. Finally, it was found that increased feedback and improved information flow would have a positive impact on the usage of daily orders. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Detecting {{changes in}} stock prices {{is a well}} known problem in finance with {{important}} implications for monitoring and business intelligence. Forewarning of changes in stock price, {{can be made by}} the early detection of changes in the distributions of <b>stock</b> <b>order</b> numbers. In this paper, we address the change detection problem for streams of <b>stock</b> <b>order</b> numbers and propose a novel incremental detection algorithm. Our algorithm gains high accuracy and low delay by employing a natural Poisson distribution assumption about the nature of <b>stock</b> <b>order</b> streams. We establish that our algorithm is highly scalable and has linear complexity. We also experimentally demonstrate its effectiveness for detecting change points, via experiments using both synthetic and real-world datasets. I...|$|E

40|$|NoThis paper {{presents}} a stochastic automaton approach to <b>stock</b> <b>ordering</b> for retailers of time-limited goods, {{in the modern}} supply chain network. The rationale applied is that by ordering in small quantities frequently, overstocking will be reduced, capital liquidity improved and wastage limited. A consequence for the complete supply chain is that such an approach could substantially minimise the reactive bullwhip effect, leading to more efficient utilisation, production and agility throughout the chain. Such agility and flexibility can only be achieved by full integration of stock inventory monitoring technologies (such as RFID) with enterprise integration systems (such as ERP) connected to suppliers, mediated by the internet. We undertake a comparative simulation study of <b>stock</b> <b>ordering</b> using a stochastic automaton and a naive traditional approach. This shows that stochastic ordering, prompted by a stochastic automaton, exhibits characteristic properties that are a prerequisite for reducing the bullwhip effect, thus enabling agile inventory management...|$|R

Institutional (proprietary) investors favor large capitalization stocks, and co-movement in institutional (proprietary) order imbalances is stronger for these <b>stocks.</b> <b>Order</b> imbalance Commonality Individual Institutional Proprietary investors...|$|R

The predictive ability of OFD for future macroeconomic fundamentals is robust to the inclusion of return factors and business cycle predictors, and it is thus a state variable candidate in the spirit of Merton (1973). Consistent with this view, we document that OFD commands a statistically significant negative risk premium in cross-sectional asset pricing tests...|$|E

This paper introduces a method to reduce the complexity by relaxing the demand for optimality. The distance from optimality is kept within prespecified bounds {{and the size of}} the bounds determines the computational complexity. Sev-eral computational examples are considered. The first is optimal switching between linear systems, with application to design of a dc/dc voltage converter. The second is optimal control of a linear system with piecewise linear cost with application to <b>stock</b> <b>order</b> control. Finally, the method is applied to a partially observable Markov decision problem (POMDP). Index Terms—Dynamic programming, nonlinear synthesis, optimal control, switching systems...|$|E
