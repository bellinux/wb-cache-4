40|$|Interlocking {{compressed}} earth blocks (ICEBs) are cement stabilized soil {{blocks that}} allow for dry stacked construction. The incomplete understanding of the inelastic performance of ICEB building systems limits widespread acceptance of this structural system in earthquake prone areas. This thesis presents results from an experimental program designed to explore the behavior of ICEB walls, built according to current design practice in Indonesia and Thailand, and subjected to out-of-plane loading. A total of five reinforced and grouted ICEB walls were constructed and tested. Results from experimentation show the current masonry design code, ACI 530, adequately predicts the yield strength of these walls. However, ACI 530 grossly over-predicts the ICEB wall stiffness. All tests showed flexural behavior and failure, except for one wall. A brittle failure was observed in one wall before reaching the predicted flexural strength, prompting a suggested maximum <b>shear</b> <b>tie</b> spacing. The testing results provide useful data for developing analytical models that predicts the seismic behavior of ICEB walls under out-of-plane loading. A moment-curvature relationship was developed that accurately predicts the behavior of these walls in the elastic range {{as well as the}} inelastic range. By comparing the data provided by two walls of similar sizes, one including a pilaster and one without a pilaster, insight into stiffener elements was gained. Analysis of these two walls provides a limit on the length and height of ICEB walls without stiffener elements to prevent significant structural damage during a seismic event. In all, conclusions based on experimental data from ICEB out-of-plane loading tests are aimed to provide suggestions for ICEB construction in areas of high-seismicity...|$|R

40|$|This study {{deals with}} {{experimental}} investigation for enhancing the flexural and shear capacity of RC beams using Glass fiber reinforced polymers (GFRP) and Carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP). Fifteen concrete beam specimens with dimensions of 110 mm width, 200 mm height and 1300 mm length were fabricated in the laboratory. As per practical consideration of pre-stressed bridge girders, one 30 mm diameter longitudinal hole was provided below the neutral axis in the tension zone {{in all the}} beams for future strengthening, service lines and other consideration. The geometry of all beams was kept constant, while steel reinforcement varied as per initial design. Out of 15 beams four were control beams. One beam was made without any steel reinforcement strengthened with two layers of GFRP fabrics U- jacketed over the full span. Five beams were weak in flexure, strengthened using GFRP fabrics with varying configurations in higher flexural zone. Four beams were weak in <b>shear,</b> (<b>tied</b> with two 6 -Ø stirrups in each support, one 6 -Ø stirrup at mid span to keep the grill intact for concreting) strengthened using GFRP fabrics with varying configurations in higher shear zones near both supports. One beam was made weak in shear, strengthened with CFRP fabrics in higher shear zones near both supports. All the beams were simply supported at both ends with 1000 mm effective span, 150 mm bearings, loaded under more realistic loading conditions, i. e. uniformly distributed loaded (UDL) and tested up to failure by gradually increasing super imposed load. The preparation of concrete surface was done with great care and showed no bond failure in all U-jacketed and inclined stripped beams. One beam bonded with GFRP fabric in the soffit bottom only failed due to debonding. The flexural and shear capacities of the beams are compared with the theoretical prediction using codal provisions. The experimental deflection of beams are also compared with the theoretical predictions. The beams weak in flexure after strengthening showed remarkable flexural strength with 33...|$|R

40|$|The {{ultimate}} strength of R/C beams retrofitted in flexure and shear {{by means of}} externally bonded fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) has {{attracted the attention of}} many researchers due to the particularities highlighted by a wide set of experimental results. In fact, an increase of the external reinforcement area does not always lead to the expected increase of the beam load capacity, due to the interaction of flexural and shear behaviour within the discontinuity regions of the strengthened element. In this paper, the available experimental data are considered and, in the light of an equilibrated equivalent truss model, a theoretical explanation of the observed behaviour is presented. A new definition of the design strength of the externally bonded FRP reinforcement is proposed, for both flexural plates and <b>shear</b> <b>ties,</b> taking into account the ultimate anchorage force. In {{the first part of the}} paper the model is presented and discussed; in the second part, the proposed model is validated by comparison with more than one hundred experimental results. The application to the available experimental tests shows the robustness of the method, which appears to be fully eligible as a design practice procedure...|$|E
40|$|Advanced fiber {{reinforced}} {{polymer matrix}} composite aircraft are highly susceptible to impact damage. One source of impact is hail, which causes matrix cracking, delamination, and fiber breakage. Impacts near joints can cause disbond. Such damage decreases structural integrity, yet {{can be difficult}} to detect. Thus, it is important to gain an understanding of impact damage modes and the thresholds at which damage occurs. Many 61. 0 mm diameter simulated hail ice (SHI) impacts at normal incidence angle were performed on full-scale stiffened carbon/epoxy panels to observe what damage resulted {{as a function of the}} impact location relative to the stiffeners. The study involved 1. 42 m x 1. 93 m curved panels made of Toray T 800 / 3900 - 2 unidirectional carbon/epoxy with 16 ply quasi- isotropic skin, and hat shaped stringers. Impacts were applied at: locations away from the stringers (the middle of the bay), the middle of the stringers, on stringer flanges, and over <b>shear</b> <b>ties.</b> Failure threshold energies (FTE) and the progression of damage modes for each type of impact were established. Stringer flange impacts were found to be most critical, resulting in flange unzipping with a FTE range of 49 - 147 J at the free end of the flange, and a FTE of 183 J at the middle of the flange. The resulting damage states were found to be dependent on peripheral boundary conditions affecting local bending stiffness, such as where the skin and stringer stiffeners mee...|$|E
40|$|SC wall piers are {{composite}} {{alternatives to}} conventional reinforced concrete (RC) shear walls where the steel rebar curtains {{are replaced by}} steel faceplates on the exterior surfaces of the walls. This approach expedites construction by {{eliminating the need for}} additional formwork and staging of concrete casting. This approach can also provide structural efficiency if the SC wall cross-section is detailed appropriately with adequate connector elements, i. e. <b>shear</b> connectors and <b>tie</b> bars. The connector elements provide composite action and also restrain the steel faceplates from buckling prematurely (before yielding). Additionally, the concrete infill prevents the steel faceplates from buckling inwards thus improving their stability. ^ Steel-plate composite (SC) walls are being used in the third generation (Gen. III) of safety-related nuclear facilities and they are also being considered for small modular reactors (SMRs) of the future. There is also growing interest in the use of SC walls for commercial building applications in seismic regions. This interest stems from the perceived structural efficiency and construction (or schedule) economy of modular composite construction. This study describes the seismic behavior, analysis and design of steel-plate composite (SC) walls and their basemat anchorage connections. Three sets of large scale tests were conducted to investigate: (i) the in-plane behavior and design of rectangular SC wall piers without boundary elements, (ii) the performance of two different SC wall pier-to-concrete basemat connections, and (iii) the direct shear strength of reinforcement bar-coupler anchors for SC walls. Test results were used to benchmark 3 D nonlinear inelastic finite element models including material inelasticity and geometric nonlinearity. The benchmarked models were used to conduct parametric studies to evaluate the effects of reinforcement ratio, wall thickness, and aspect ratio (wall height/wall length) on the in-plane behavior of SC wall piers. Results of the tests and parametric studies were used to propose preliminary design equations and recommendations for predicting the lateral load capacity of SC wall piers with full-strength and overstrength connections, respectively. ...|$|R
40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} (RC) structures {{have historically}} been the preferred choice for blast resistant structures because of their mass and the ductility provided by steel reinforcement. Steel-plate composite (SC) walls are {{a viable alternative to}} RC for protecting the infrastructure against explosive threats. SC structures consist of two steel faceplates with plain concrete core between them. The steel faceplates are anchored to the concrete using stud anchors and connected to each other using tie bars. SC structures provide mass from the concrete infill and ductility from the continuous external steel faceplates. This dissertation presents findings and recommendations from experimental and analytical investigations of the performance of SC walls subjected to far-field blast loads. ^ Twelve SC panels were tested in the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Engineering Research and Development Center (ERDC) Blast Load Simulator (BLS). These panels varied flexure and <b>shear</b> reinforcement ratios, <b>tie</b> bar spacing, and steel faceplate strength. Results from the physical experiments were used to benchmark numerical models which were then used to expand the experimental database and perform a series of parametric studies investigating the influence of blast load, geometric, material, and analysis parameters. ^ Two benchmarked models were developed: (1) detailed finite element (FE) models using the non-linear FE code LS-DYNA, and (2) idealized single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) models using experimentally validated bilinear strain hardening static resistance functions and exponential decay or triangular load pulse forcing functions. The idealized static resistance functions were developed from static tests of eight configurations of SC walls which were also used to benchmark the FE modeling method. The results from the static experimental tests and benchmarked models are also provided in this dissertation. ^ Results from the physical experiments and analytical parametric studies were used to develop design recommendations. A rational method for designing SC walls to resist specific blast loads is presented along with pressure-impulse diagrams for use as design tools or aids. ...|$|R
40|$|As {{the use of}} {{advanced}} composite materials continues {{to grow in the}} aviation industry, damage detection techniques need to be developed and tested. Impact damage on aluminum aircraft structures can be detected from obvious surface indications. This is not the case in composite aircraft structure. Large interply delaminations and substructure disbonding may occur {{as a result of an}} impact, often leaving no visual indications of damage. This research investigates the use of conventional hand-deployed ultrasonic (UT) inspection techniques and more advanced UT pulse-echo and resonance scanning techniques to detect and characterize damage in full-scale carbon fiber fuselage structure. It also examines embedded and bonded methods of deploying an in-situ fiber optic (FO) Swept Wavelength Interferometry (SWI) strain sensing system for damage detection. The hypothesis is that the more advanced scanning nondestructive inspection (NDI) techniques used in the study will more effectively detect and characterize damage modes in the fuselage panels than hand-deployed UT techniques. It is further hypothesized that impact damage created by both simulated hail and steel spherical tip impacts will create a permanent, detectable strain change that can be detected by the FO strain measurement system. Two fuselage panels representative of structures seen on advanced composite transport category aircraft were fabricated. They each measured approximately 56 ” x 76 ”. The structural components consisted of a 16 ply skin, co-cured, hat-section stringers, fastened <b>shear</b> <b>ties</b> and frames. The material used to fabricate the panels was T 800 unidirectional, carbon pre-preg and was processed in an autoclave. Simulated hail impact testing was conducted on the panels using a high velocity gas gun with 2. 4 ” diameter ice balls. The ice impact tests were performed in collaboration with the University of California San Diego (UCSD). In addition to the simulated hail impact testing, 2 ” diameter spherical tip steel impacts were conducted to simulate impact damage introduced during heavy ground maintenance operations. The extent of 16 ply skin damage induced on the panels ranged from less than 1 in 2 to 55 in 2 of interply delamination. Substructure damage on the panels included shear tie cracking, delamination of the built-up pad sections behind the fastened <b>shear</b> <b>ties,</b> and stringer-to-flange disbonding. Substructure damage away from the site of high energy ice impacts was often not detected with hand-deployed UT, which can be attributed to failure to inspect far enough away from the impact site. This additional damage was detected using the more advanced scanning techniques. Data collection from the embedded FO was not possible due to light attenuation caused by micro-bending induced in the fiber. It was determined that increasing both the numerical aperture of the FO and the diameter, in combination with adjusting the layout orientation used, may make it possible to measure strain change using this technique. Detectable strain indications were obtained using the backside bonded FO in 15 of the 25 interrogated steel tip impacts. Increasing the robustness of this deployment method could provide a means for in-situ damage detection. Federal Aviation Administration - William J.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Architectural Engineering and Construction ScienceKimberly Waggle KramerInsulated precast {{concrete}} sandwich panels {{are commonly used}} for exterior cladding on a building. In recent years, insulated tilt-up concrete sandwich panels are being used for the exterior load-bearing walls on a building. The insulation is sandwiched between exterior and interior concrete layers to reduce the heating and cooling costs for the structure. The panels can be designed as composite, partially composite, or non-composite. The <b>shear</b> <b>ties</b> are used to achieve these varying degrees of composite action between the concrete layers. A parametric study analyzing the standard, solid single-wythe tilt-up concrete wall panel and solid sandwich (double-wythe separated by rigid insulation) tilt-up concrete wall panels subjected to eccentric axial loads and out-of-plane seismic loads is presented. The sandwich tilt-up panel {{is divided into two}} categories – non-composite and composite wall panels. The height and width of the different types of tilt-up wall panel is 23 feet (21 feet plus 2 -foot parapet) and 16 feet, respectively. The solid standard panel (non-sandwich) is 5. 5 inches in thickness; the non-composite sandwich panel is composed of 3. 5 -inch architectural wythe, 2. 5 -inch rigid insulation, and 5. 5 -inch interior load bearing concrete wythe; and the composite sandwich panel is composed of 3. 5 -inch exterior, load bearing concrete wythe, 2. 5 -inch insulation, and 5. 5 -inch interior, load bearing concrete wythe. The procedure used to design the tilt-up wall panels is the Alternative Method for Out-of-Plane Slender Wall Analysis per Section 11. 8 of ACI 318 - 14 Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete and Commentary. The results indicated that for the given panels, the applied ultimate moment and design moment strength is the greatest for the composite sandwich tilt-up concrete panel. The standard tilt-up concrete panel exhibits the greatest service load deflection. The non-composite sandwich tilt-up concrete panel induced the greatest vertical stress. Additionally, the additional requirements regarding forming materials, casting, and crane capacity is covered in this report. Lastly, the energy efficiency due to the heat loss and heat gain of sandwich panels is briefly discussed in this report. The sandwich tilt-up panels exhibit greater energy efficiency than standard tilt-up panels with or without insulation...|$|E
