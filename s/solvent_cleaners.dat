40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 While {{perchloroethylene}} <b>solvent</b> based dry <b>cleaners</b> {{occupational exposures}} and machine wastes {{have been well}} characterized, {{little is known about}} exposures to alternative solvent s and their wastes or the hazardous waste status of the wastes. Additionally, knowledge of detergents and spot treatment products is sparse. Samples of still bottoms and separator water, and cleaning products were taken from ten petroleum based hydrocarbon <b>solvent</b> dry <b>cleaners</b> in King County and one cleaner using a new solvent (Solvon K 4) to the market based on butylal. The samples were analyzed for volatile organic compounds (VOC), semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOC), metals, pH, flash point, and total organic halogens (TOH). This information was used to characterize the waste using Washington State hazardous waste criteria. All samples of hydrocarbon and butylal still bottoms designated as dangerous waste on the basis of TOH. Five of the ten hydrocarbon solvent still bottom samples also had flash points below 140 ˚F as did one of the four butylal still bottom samples. Only one sample of separator water designated as dangerous. This sample was visually different from the others, with a clear layer of solvent on the surface. A wide variety of spot treatment products are used by the dry cleaners sampled. Six of these contained probable or potential carcinogens at concentrations greater than 0. 1 % not listed as such on the MSDS. Additionally, one of the seven detergents sampled contained 0. 11 % methylene chloride. These findings raise concerns for occupation exposure to toxic chemicals that the workers may not be aware of even if they have read the MSDS for the products they work with on a daily basis. The waste characterization indicates that waste from alternative <b>solvent</b> dry <b>cleaners</b> may be considered dangerous waste and should be treated as such with proper disposal and handling procedures...|$|R

5000|$|How best to {{lubricate}} a bicycle chain is a commonly debated question among cyclists. Liquid lubricants penetrate {{to the inside}} of the links and are not easily displaced, but quickly attract dirt. [...] "Dry" [...] lubricants, often containing wax or Teflon, are transported by an evaporating <b>solvent,</b> and stay <b>cleaner</b> in use. The cardinal rule for long chain life is never {{to lubricate}} a dirty chain, as this washes abrasive particles into the rollers. Chains should be cleaned before lubrication. The chain should be wiped dry after the lubricant has had enough time to penetrate the links. An alternative approach is to change the (relatively cheap) chain very frequently; then proper care is less important. Some utility bicycles have fully enclosing chain guards, which virtually eliminate chain wear and maintenance. On recumbent bicycles the chain is often run through tubes to prevent it from picking up dirt, and to keep the cyclist's leg free from oil and dirt.|$|R

50|$|Another major {{criticism}} of the M60 was the inseparability of the barrel from the gas system regulator and the bipod. The sole advantage of the fixed regulator was preventing the operator from inadvertently damaging the weapon by setting the gas pressure too high, though this actually {{proved to be a}} major disadvantage in combat; the lack of an adjustable regulator also prevented the gunner from combating progressive fouling of the gas system by increasing the pressure to compensate. The result was insufficient gas power to operate the action after lengthy periods of fire, a situation only remedied by a full field strip of the weapon and cleaning the gas system with <b>solvent</b> and pipe <b>cleaners,</b> a virtually impossible procedure in a combat environment. The non-adjustable front sight is welded to the barrel, causing the weapon's sight calibration ("zero") to be ruined every time a barrel was changed.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to optimize and validate the solid-liquid extraction (ESL) technique for determination of picloram residues in soil samples. At the optimization stage, the optimal conditions for extraction of soil samples were determined using univariate analysis. Ratio soil/solution extraction, type and time of agitation, ionic strength and pH of extraction solution were evaluated. Based on the optimized parameters, the following method of extraction and analysis of picloram was developed: weigh 2. 00 g of soil dried and sieved through a sieve mesh of 2. 0 mm pore, add 20. 0 mL of KCl concentration of 0. 5 mol L- 1, shake the bottle in the vortex for 10 seconds to form suspension and adjust to pH 7. 00, with alkaline KOH 0. 1 mol L- 1. Homogenate the system in a shaker system for 60 minutes and then let it stand for 10 minutes. The bottles are centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3, 500 rpm. After the settlement of the soil particles and cleaning of the supernatant extract, an aliquot is withdrawn and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. The optimized method was validated by determining the selectivity, linearity, detection and quantification limits, precision and accuracy. The ESL methodology was efficient for analysis of residues of the pesticides studied, with percentages of recovery above 90 %. The limits of detection and quantification were 20. 0 and 66. 0 mg kg- 1 soil for the PVA, and 40. 0 and 132. 0 mg kg- 1 soil for the VLA. The coefficients of variation (CV) were equal to 2. 32 and 2. 69 for PVA and TH soils, respectively. The methodology resulted in low organic <b>solvent</b> consumption and <b>cleaner</b> extracts, as well as no purification steps for chromatographic analysis were required.

40|$|Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are an {{interesting}} class of porous materials, for potential commercial applications such as storage and separation of gases. However, the industrial use of MOFs would require their synthesis on a much larger scale, necessitating the development of scalable synthesis techniques that are both greener and faster than those currently employed. This Thesis describes the recent progress towards the clean and scalable synthesis of MOF materials via the use of high temperature water (HTW) and related solvents. Supercritical ethanol extraction is also presented as a greener alternative {{for the removal of}} impurities, such as unreacted ligand, from within the pores of MOFs. Chapter 1 introduces the concepts explored during this work, such as green chemistry, and includes a brief overview of MOF materials, covering their properties, applications and synthesis, as well as the challenges facing their industrial implementation. The properties of HTW and supercritical ethanol, in relation to their use as <b>cleaner</b> <b>solvents</b> for MOF processing, are summarised and the aims of this project stated. The high pressure equipment and analysis techniques used during this work are then described in Chapter 2. Detailed descriptions and standard operating procedures for the following equipment are included: high pressure mini autoclaves; a continuous flow HTW reactor for the synthesis of MOF materials; and a supercritical ethanol extraction set up, for the removal of impurities from within MOF samples. (Information regarding a new continuous flow rig developed during this project can be found in Chapter 6). The use of supercritical ethanol as a cleaner alternative method for the removal of uncoordinated ligand from within the pores of MOF materials is explored in Chapter 3, where MIL 53 (Al), an archetypal aluminium MOF, was used as an example throughout. The impact of this technique on the properties of the resulting MOF samples are also considered within this chapter. Chapter 4 illustrates the broad applicability of HTW to MOF materials, demonstrating the synthesis {{of a wide range of}} MOFs, primarily as fast batch reactions. Unlike typical MOF syntheses which require several days, reaction times of just 10 minutes were used during this investigation. This highlights the fact that the synthesis of MOFs in HTW is both faster and cleaner than many previous methods. The variety of MOFs synthesised in this chapter contain different metal centres and ligands, confirming that HTW synthesis is not limited to a small sub set of MOF materials. MOFs successfully synthesised in this manner include: MIL 96 (Al); NOTT 300 (Al); NOTT- 300 (In); scandium terephthalate, plus amine and nitro group containing analogues; and MOF 74 (Ni). The synthesis of a larger (10 g) sample of one of these MOFs, NOTT 300 (Al), is the subject of Chapter 5, which can be viewed as a case study into the challenges facing the scalable synthesis of MOF materials in both batch and continuous flow. Building on experience gained during this investigation, a new continuous flow HTW MOF synthesis reactor was designed and constructed, the development and testing of which forms the basis of Chapter 6. This new reactor was then implemented in Chapter 7, which describes the HTW synthesis of a range of functionalised aluminium MOFs, based on the MIL 53 (Al) structure, containing additional amine or nitro groups, in both batch and flow. These MOFs were the first examples of the synthesis of functionalised MOF materials in HTW, demonstrating the flexibility of this technique and suggesting that it may be successfully applied to a much wider range of MOFs in the future. Finally, Chapter 8 revisits the aims set out in Chapter 1, providing a summary of the progress made towards meeting each aim and highlighting possible future directions...|$|R
40|$|Summary Chapter 1 {{provides}} a short introduction into {{the constraints of}} phytochemical analysis. In order to make them faster, less laborious and greener, {{there is a clear}} scope for miniaturized and simplified sample preparation, solvent-free extractions and the use of <b>cleaner</b> <b>solvents</b> in preparative HPLC. Possible modern techniques to achieve this, such as microfluidic chips, ambient mass spectrometry, selective magnetic nanoparticles, and use of less toxic but equally efficient solvents are discussed. Clear aims were formulated and research towards fulfilling these aims in the field of phytochemical analysis is carried out in this thesis. A first version of a 3 -phase liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) chip for the miniaturized sample pretreatment of alkaloids was introduced by our group in 2009. In Chapter 2 more biodegradable and less-toxic solvents for the transport phase and a more suitable pH for the feed phase were evaluated. The extraction efficiency improved. On-line hyphenation of the 3 -phase chip to nanoLC-UV/MS was also investigated. This combination saved {{a lot of time and}} solvent in comparison with traditional methods for the purification of alkaloids from plant materials. A novel Induced Phase Separation Extraction (IPSE) chip was introduced in Chapter 3 for efficient sample pretreatment. The acetonitrile – water (1 : 1) sample solutions were separated in organic and aqueous phases in this IPSE chip based on their affinity for both phases. In turn this could be correlated with the log D values of the analytes. Some optimization regarding design, operation, flows and solvents was carried out. Extraction efficiencies of several model compounds were determined. A real sample application with a plant used in Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCMs) was carried out to show the usefulness of the IPSE chip in dealing with complex matrixes. Chapter 4 presented an unambiguous distinction between toxic Japanese star anise and non-toxic Chinese star anise fruits within seconds without any sample pretreatment by DART-orbitrap MS technology. Both positive and negative mode gave the same result, although the latter mode is preferred because of its higher sensitivity and cleaner spectra. Not only raw plant materials but also a herbal tea containing both Chinese and Japanese star anise could be quickly and accurately distinguished by DART-HRMS. In Chapter 5, direct plant spray in combination with orbitrap HRMS allowed, like DART-HRMS, for an unambiguous distinction between toxic Japanese star anise and non-toxic Chinese star anise fruits within seconds without any sample pretreatment in both positive and negative mode. Direct plant spray ionization has the advantage of low cost, simplicity, room temperature and low standard deviations. Neither the DART nor the direct spray method is very suitable for quantitative measurements of solid samples like star anise fruits. Chapter 6 describes the purification of eight ginkgolic acids (GAs) from raw plant material (Ginkgo biloba) by using only three steps, namely (1) extraction; (2) selective purification by cheap Fe 3 O 4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs); (3) preparative HPLC on a C 8 column. The three main constituents occurring at concentrations of 0. 15 % - 0. 60 % were enriched to > 95 % absolute purity without using tedious (gravity) column chromatography with halogenated solvents. Preparative RP-HPLC is an efficient but not very green technique for the final purification of fine chemicals and natural products as large volumes of acetonitrile, methanol and tetrahydrofuran (THF) are consumed. In Chapter 7 it was investigated whether less toxic organic solvents could replace them. As a test case the preparative separation of Ginkgo terpene trilactones (TTLs) was selected. By a two-step chromatographic optimization procedure a 30 min gradient using only water, ethanol, acetone and ethyl acetate was developed, which gave a baseline separation of 480 mg of an injected TTLs mixture. All five individual TTLs were > 95 % pure. Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCMs) are one of the oldest and most used traditional drugs in the world. Many plants are used for their preparation. An overview of HPLC-related methods such as: multicomponent quantitation, fingerprinting, bioaffinity chromatography and on-flow assays for screening and quality control of TCMs was presented and discussed in Chapter 8. The final Chapter 9 discusses the major findings of this work and gives further perspectives.        ...|$|R
