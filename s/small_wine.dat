Within a year he had taken a full-time position with a <b>small</b> <b>wine</b> distributor, and by 1952 he was engaged by Blumenthal & Co, a major wine importer. Sponsored by Blumenthal, he attended tastings and lectures held by the Wine Trade Club at the Worshipful Company of Vintners in London, and in 1953 a scholarship allowed him to spend time working and studying in Jerez, the Spanish region that produces Sherry. Further such scholarships {{over the next two years}} despatched Asher to Burgundy in eastern France, then the Rheingau wine region in West Germany.|$|E

50|$|Lambrusco Grasparossa di Castelvetro- The <b>smallest</b> <b>wine</b> {{producing}} region located {{south of the}} town of Modena. The region is home to Grasparossa of which the DOC requires 85% of the wine to be composed of. The wine of this region is typically dry and full bodied with a deep purplish-red coloring.

25|$|Wachau {{is one of}} Austria's most {{established}} and notable wine regions, specializing in dry wines made from Riesling and Grüner Veltliner. Located in Lower Austria along the Danube, west of Vienna and Krems an der Donau, {{it is one of}} the westernmost wine producing regions in Austria with only a few scattered plantings in Tyrol being further west. While most of Austria follows a wine classification systems based on ripeness and harvest must weight that parallels the German wine classification system, Wachau wines have a unique classification system. The three classification levels for Wachau wine include Steinfeder for wines up to 11.5% alcohol level, Federspiel for wines between 11.5–12.5% and Smaragd that must have a minimum of 12.5% alcohol level. Despite its renown, the Wachau is a <b>small</b> <b>wine</b> region that usually accounts for only around 3% of Austria's wine production.|$|E
2500|$|Martinborough is a <b>small</b> <b>wine</b> village {{located at}} the foot of New Zealand’s North Island, in the South Wairarapa, just 1.5 hours drive from Wellington, the capital city. The {{combination}} of topography, geology, climate and human effort has led to the region becoming one of New Zealand's premier wine regions in spite of its small size. Less than 2% of the country's wine production is grown in Martinborough, yet in shows and competitions, it rates much more highly. The local Winegrowers organization states: [...] "Officially New Zealand's sixth largest region, Wellington/Wairarapa is small in production terms but makes a large contribution to the country's quality winemaking reputation.".|$|E

The wine district is centered to the northeast of the village in densely wooden and hilly terrain. Monte Amiata, the highest peak in Southern Tuscany, provides a sheltering influence from the southeast and tempers the region's climate and rainfall. Compared to the nearly [...] of planted land in Chianti, Montalcino is a relatively <b>small</b> <b>wine</b> region with around [...] planted. Vineyards in Montalcino are planted in varied soils—including limestone, clay, schist, volcanic soil and a crumbly marl known as galestro—at altitudes ranging from 149 m [...] to 500 m. This diversity in terroir contributes to the vast range in quality and potential complexity of Brunello di Montalcino.|$|E

2500|$|The {{goal of the}} BDL was to {{preserve}} the leading position of agriculture {{in the economy and}} politics of Germany. In one of the founding documents it says: [...] "German agriculture is the primary and most important industry, the strongest support of the empire and of the several states. To protect and strengthen agriculture is our first and most serious task because by the blossoming and flourishing of agriculture, the welfare of all professions is secured." [...] But the BDL also came to the defense of the mom and pop shops as against big-city department store chains, they safeguarded the interests of the rural and small urban middle class, the shop assistants, rural workers, sailors and fishermen and <b>small</b> <b>wine</b> growers. Basically they took all non-industrial workers, and small businesses under their wing.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, {{the wines}} of the Barolo region {{became one of}} the first Italian wines to receive DOCG status. Produced to the {{southwest}} of the town of Alba in the hills of the Langhe, Barolo is a big, tannic expression of the Nebbiolo grape. The soil of this area is a composition of clay and marl which [...] helps to lessen the naturally high acidity of Nebbiolo. The Tanaro river flows through the heart of Barolo country and serves as a tempering influence on the region's summertime heat till harvest time in late October/mid November. A <b>small</b> <b>wine</b> region, extending over 7 miles in length and 5 miles at its widest point, Barolo produces about 500,000 cases of wine annually. Nearly 87% of the zone productions comes from vineyards in five communities.|$|E

25|$|The Snipes Mountain AVA was {{established}} in 2009. At , {{it is one of}} Washington's <b>smaller</b> <b>wine</b> regions. The viticultural area is located on Snipes Mountain, a long anticline ridge that rises from the floor of the Lower Yakima Valley with comparatively unique, rocky soils, called aridisols. The viticultural area also includes Harrison Hill, which lies contiguously east of Snipes Mountain and has similar soil and topography.|$|R
50|$|The {{boundary}} of the North Coast AVA encompasses many <b>smaller</b> <b>wine</b> appellations, which generally have higher consumer appeal and therefore higher commercial value.

The North Coast AVA designation is primarily used on bottles of wine created by blending wines from several counties or American Viticultural Areas.|$|R

2500|$|After making {{wine for}} 25 years, Kuleto {{established}} the Kuleto Estate Family Winery on an [...] property in Napa Valley. [...] He purchased the estate in 1992 {{as a replacement}} for his old home, which had burned down, and spent the next five years building a [...] home there, which he called Villa Cucina. [...] Although he began growing grapes on the ranch in 1993, and made his own wine, he had not opened up a commercial winery. [...] Construction of the new winery began in 1999 and ended in 2003. [...] As of 2005 the winery was producing 7,500 cases per year of wine, which it sold in the range of $20 to $50 per bottle, from [...] of grapes. [...] Kuleto served as owner, builder, designer, and co-winemaker. [...] He also raises livestock and farms fish, produce and olives on the property, most of which are processed for private events held on the property. [...] In 2009 Kuleto sold a controlling interest in the wine business (but {{only a small portion of}} the grounds and vineyards) to a <b>small</b> <b>wine</b> conglomerate run by financier William P.

25|$|Situated on two {{plateaus}} between Pauillac and Margaux, {{the wine}} region of St-Julien has the <b>smallest</b> <b>wine</b> {{production of the}} four major regions in the Médoc. The region is divided into essentially two areas - the riverside estates around the village of St.Julien and the southern estates around the village of Beychevelle where the areas Cru Bourgeois are also grouped. The waters of the Gironde estuary have a warming influence on the climate which, coupled with the south-easterly exposure of most vineyards, helps to fully ripen the Cabernet Sauvignon vines in this area.|$|R

Gerald replied, for his companion's Spanish although fluent was not good enough to pass as that of a native.

60|$|Nevertheless, {{there was}} no lack of outward means for leading an {{agreeable}} life in the old villa. Wandering musicians haunted the precincts of Monte Beni, where they seemed to claim a prescriptive right; they made the lawn and shrubbery tuneful {{with the sound of}} fiddle, harp, and flute, and now and then with the tangled squeaking of a bagpipe. Improvisatori likewise came and told tales or recited verses to the contadini--among whom Kenyon was often an auditor--after their day's work in the vineyard. Jugglers, too, obtained permission to do feats of magic in the hall, where they set even the sage Tomaso, and Stella, Girolamo, and the peasant girls from the farmhouse, all of a broad grin, between merriment and wonder. These good people got food and lodging for their pleasant pains, and some of the <b>small</b> <b>wine</b> of Tuscany, and a reasonable handful of the Grand Duke's copper coin, to keep up the hospitable renown of Monte Beni. But very seldom had they the young Count as a listener or a spectator.|$|E

A man who thinks of putting away a composition for ten years before he shall give it to the world, or exercise his own maturer judgment upon it, had best be very sure of the original strength and durability of the work; otherwise on withdrawing it from its crypt he may find, that like <b>small</b> <b>wine</b> it has lost what flavour it once had, and is only tasteless when opened.
