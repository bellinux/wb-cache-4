25|$|Aniline is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula C6H5NH2. Consisting of a phenyl group attached to an amino group, aniline is the prototypical aromatic amine. Its main use {{is in the}} manufacture of precursors to polyurethane and other industrial chemicals. Like most volatile amines, it possesses the odour of rotten fish. It ignites readily, burning with a <b>smoky</b> <b>flame</b> characteristic of aromatic compounds.|$|E
25|$|Although “coal oil” {{was well}} known by {{industrial}} chemists at least {{as early as the}} 1700s as a byproduct of making coal gas and coal tar, it burned with a <b>smoky</b> <b>flame</b> that prevented its use for indoor illumination. In cities, much indoor illumination was provided by piped-in coal gas, but outside the cities, and for spot lighting within the cities, the lucrative market for fueling indoor lamps was supplied by whale oil, specifically that from sperm whales, which burned brighter and cleaner.|$|E
60|$|The <b>smoky</b> <b>flame</b> of {{a little}} lamp flared upon the rock above, which trickled with moisture, and the light fell upon Nasmyth's wet face, which was deeply flushed. Nasmyth gasped heavily, and great {{splashes}} of sand and mire lay thick upon his torn, drenched shirt. He appeared to see Wheeler, for he looked up, {{but he did not}} stop until he had driven the wedge in. Then he rose to his knees and stretched himself wearily.|$|E
60|$|He {{scrambled}} by Wheeler and crouched close {{beneath the}} <b>smoky,</b> flickering <b>flame,</b> dripping, spattered with mire, and very grim in face. The note was from Violet Hamilton, {{and it was}} brief.|$|R
5000|$|... "One end of {{the candle}} was ignited by a Bunsen flame, the fat {{catching}} fire after about a minute. Although the Bunsen was removed at this point, combustion of the fat proceeded slowly {{along the length of}} the roll, with a <b>smoky</b> yellow <b>flame</b> and much production of soot, the entire roll being consumed after about one hour." ...|$|R
60|$|My brother {{noticed a}} pale grey smoke or haze rising among {{the houses in}} front of them, and veiling the white facade of a terrace beyond the road that {{appeared}} between {{the backs of the}} villas. Mrs. Elphinstone suddenly cried out at a number of tongues of <b>smoky</b> red <b>flame</b> leaping up above the houses in front of them against the hot, blue sky. The tumultuous noise resolved itself now into the disorderly mingling of many voices, the gride of many wheels, the creaking of waggons, and the staccato of hoofs. The lane came round sharply not fifty yards from the crossroads.|$|R
60|$|Night fell to {{the music}} of the paddles, to the scent of the officers' cigars, to the blood-red vomit of the tall stacks and the <b>smoky</b> <b>flame</b> of the torches. Then Christmas Day dawned, and there was Vicksburg lifted two hundred feet above the fever swamps, her court-house shining in the morning sun. Vicksburg, the well-nigh impregnable key to America's highway. When old Vick made his {{plantation}} on the Walnut Hills, he chose a site for a fortress of the future Confederacy that Vauban would have delighted in.|$|E
60|$|A long passage {{brought them}} {{to a number of}} small, square, low chambers[41] leading into each other. They were lighted by brass lamps, placed at {{intervals}} in vacant niches, that once held corpses, and which were now soiled by the <b>smoky</b> <b>flame.</b> Between two and three hundred individuals were assembled in these chambers, at first scarcely distinguishable by those who descended from the broad daylight; but by degrees the eyesight became accustomed to the dim and vaporous atmosphere, and Al-roy recognised in the final and more illumined chamber a high cedar cabinet, the type of the ark, and which held the sacred vessels and the sanctified copy of the law.|$|E
60|$|It {{was then}} he saw the American aeroplane. He saw it {{in the light of the}} flash as a thing {{altogether}} motionless. Even its screw appeared still, and its men were rigid dolls. (For it was so near he could see the men upon it quite distinctly.) Its stern was tilting down, and the whole machine was heeling over. It was of the Colt-Coburn-Langley pattern, with double up-tilted wings and the screw ahead, and the men were in a boat-like body netted over. From this very light long body, magazine guns projected on either side. One thing that was strikingly odd and wonderful in that moment of revelation was that the left upper wing was burning downward with a reddish, <b>smoky</b> <b>flame.</b> But this was not the most wonderful thing about this apparition. The most wonderful thing was that it and a German airship five hundred yards below were threaded as it were on the lightning flash, which turned out of its path as if to take them, and, that out from the corners and projecting points of its huge wings everywhere, little branching thorn-trees of lightning were streaming.|$|E
60|$|About {{six in the}} evening, as I sat at {{tea with}} my wife in the summerhouse talking vigorously about the battle that was {{lowering}} upon us, I heard a muffled detonation from the common, and immediately after a gust of firing. Close {{on the heels of}} that came a violent rattling crash, quite close to us, that shook the ground; and, starting out upon the lawn, I saw the tops of the trees about the Oriental College burst into <b>smoky</b> red <b>flame,</b> and the tower of the little church beside it slide down into ruin. The pinnacle of the mosque had vanished, and the roof line of the college itself looked as if a hundred-ton gun had been at work upon it. One of our chimneys cracked as if a shot had hit it, flew, and a piece of it came clattering down the tiles and made a heap of broken red fragments upon the flower bed by my study window.|$|R
6000|$|After sunset, far {{across the}} fields and over the bay, {{clusters}} of torches could be seen burning under the high roofs of the council shed. <b>Smoky</b> red <b>flames</b> swayed on high poles, and the fiery blaze flickered over faces, clung to the smooth trunks of palm-trees, kindled bright sparks on the rims of metal dishes standing on fine floor-mats. That obscure adventurer feasted like a king. Small groups of men crouched in tight circles round the wooden platters; brown hands hovered over snowy heaps of rice. Sitting upon a rough couch apart from the others, he leaned on his elbow with inclined head; and near him a youth improvised in a high tone a song that celebrated his valour and wisdom. The singer rocked himself to and fro, rolling frenzied eyes; old women hobbled about with dishes, and men, squatting low, lifted their heads to listen gravely without ceasing to eat. The song of triumph vibrated in the night, and the stanzas rolled out mournful and fiery like the thoughts of a hermit. He silenced it with a sign, [...] "Enough!" [...] An owl hooted far away, exulting in the delight of deep gloom in dense foliage; overhead lizards ran in the attap thatch, calling softly; the dry leaves of the roof rustled; the rumour of mingled voices grew louder suddenly. After a circular and startled glance, as of a man waking up abruptly {{to the sense of}} danger, he would throw himself back, and under the downward gaze of the old sorcerer take up, wide-eyed, the slender thread of his dream. They watched his moods; the swelling rumour of animated talk subsided like a wave on a sloping beach. The chief is pensive. And above the spreading whisper of lowered voices only a little rattle of weapons would be heard, a single louder word distinct and alone, or the grave ring of a big brass tray.|$|R
60|$|Maybe {{the boys}} {{nowadays}} do not throw fire-balls, or know about them. They {{were made of}} cotton rags wound tight and sewed, and then soaked in turpentine. When a ball was lighted a boy caught it quickly up, and threw it, and it made a splendid streaming blaze through the air, and a thrilling whir as it flew. A boy {{had to be very}} nimble not to get burned, and a great many boys dropped the ball for every boy that threw it. I am not ready to say why these fire-balls did not set the Boy's Town on fire, and burn it down, but I know they never did. There was no law against them, and the boys were never disturbed in throwing them, any more than they were in building bonfires; and this shows, as much as anything, what a glorious town that was for boys. The way they used to build their bonfires was to set one tar-barrel on top of another, as high as the biggest boy could reach, and then drop a match into them; in a moment a dusky, <b>smoky</b> <b>flame</b> would burst from the top, and fly there like a crimson flag, while all the boys leaped and danced round it, and hurrahed for the Whig candidates. Sometimes they would tumble the blazing barrels over, and roll them up and down the street.|$|E
6000|$|I speak {{here not}} only of the {{impression}} she made upon her husband's anxious sisters, but of the judgment passed on her (he went so far as that, though it was not obvious how it mattered to him) by Raymond Benyon. And this brings me at a jump (I confess it's a very small one) {{to the fact that he}} did, after all, go back to Posilippo. He stayed away for nine days, and at the end of this time Percival Theory called upon him, to thank him for the civility he had shown his kinswomen. He went to this gentleman's hotel, to return his visit, and there he found Miss Kate, in her brother's sitting-room. She had come in by appointment from the villa, and was going with the others to seek the royal palace, which she had not yet had an opportunity to inspect It was proposed (not by Kate), and presently arranged, that Captain Benyon should go with them, and he accordingly walked over marble floors for half an hour, exchanging conscious commonplaces with the woman he loved. For this truth had rounded itself during those nine days of absence; he discovered that there was nothing particularly sweet in his life when once Kate Theory had been excluded from it He had stayed away to keep himself from falling in love with her; but this expedient was in itself illuminating, for he perceived that, according to the vulgar adage, he was locking the stable door after the horse had been stolen. As he paced the deck of his ship and looked toward Posilippo, his tenderness crystallized; the thick, <b>smoky</b> <b>flame</b> of a sentiment that knew itself forbidden and was angry at the knowledge, now danced upon the fuel of his good resolutions. The latter, it must be said, resisted, declined to be consumed. He determined that he would see Kate Theory again, for a time, just sufficient to bid her good-by, and to add a little explanation. He thought of his explanation very lovingly, but it may not strike the reader as a happy inspiration. To part from her dryly, abruptly, without an allusion to what he might have said if everything had been different,--that would be wisdom, of course, that would be virtue, that would be the line of a practical man, of a man who kept himself well in hand. But it would be virtue terribly unrewarded,--it would be virtue too austere for a person who sometimes flattered himself that he had taught himself stoicism. The minor luxury tempted him irresistibly, since the larger--that of happy love--was denied him; the luxury of letting the girl know that it would not be an accident--oh, not at all--that they should never meet again. She might easily think it was, and thinking it was would doubtless do her no harm. But this would n't give him his pleasure,--the Platonic satisfaction of expressing to her at the same time his belief that they might have made each other happy, and the necessity of his renunciation. That, probably, wouldn't hurt her either, for she had given him no proof whatever that she cared for him. The nearest approach to it was the way she walked beside him now, sweet and silent, without the least reference to his not having been back to the villa. The place was cool and dusky, the blinds were drawn, to keep out the light and noise, and the little party wandered through the high saloons, where precious marbles and the gleam of gilding and satin made reflections in the rich dimness. Here and there the cicerone, in slippers, with Neapolitan familiarity, threw open a shutter to show off a picture on a tapestry. He strolled in front with Percival Theory and his wife, while this lady, drooping silently from her husband's arm as they passed, felt the stuff of the curtains and the sofas. When he caught her in these experiments, the cicerone, in expressive deprecation, clasped his hands and lifted his eyebrows; whereupon Mrs. Theory exclaimed to her husband, [...] "Oh, bother his old king!" [...] It was not striking to Captain Benyon why Percival Theory had married the niece of Mr. Henry Piatt. He was less interesting than his sisters,--a smooth, cool, correct young man, who frequently took out a pencil and did a little arithmetic on the back of a letter. He sometimes, in spite of his correctness, chewed a toothpick, and he missed the American papers, which he used to ask for in the most unlikely places. He was a Bostonian converted to New York; a very special type.|$|E
50|$|Copaline (or copalite), also termed fossil resin or Highgate resin, is a {{naturally}} occurring organic substance found as irregular {{pieces of a}} pale yellow colour, for example in the London Clay at Highgate Hill. It has a resinous aromatic odour when freshly broken, volatilizes at a moderate temperature, and burns readily with a yellow, <b>smoky</b> <b>flame,</b> leaving scarcely any ash.|$|E

5000|$|Solidified resin {{from which}} the {{volatile}} terpene components have been removed by distillation is known as rosin. Typical rosin is a transparent or translucent mass, with a vitreous fracture and a faintly yellow or brown colour, non-odorous or having only a slight turpentine odor and taste. Rosin is insoluble in water, mostly soluble in alcohol, essential oils, ether and hot fatty oils, and softens and melts {{under the influence of}} heat, and burns with a bright but <b>smoky</b> <b>flame.</b>|$|E

50|$|In the Middle Ages in Europe, tallow candles {{were the}} most common candle. By the 13th century, candle making had become a guild craft in England and France. The candle makers (chandlers) went {{from house to house}} making candles from the kitchen fats saved for that purpose, or made and sold their own candles from small candle shops. Beeswax, {{compared}} to animal-based tallow, burned cleanly, without <b>smoky</b> <b>flame.</b> Rather than the foul and terrible odor of tallow, it emits a fresh smell. Beeswax candles were expensive, and relatively few people could afford to burn them in their homes in medieval Europe. However, they were widely used for church ceremonies.|$|E
50|$|Rosin is brittle and friable, {{with a faint}} piny odor. It is {{typically}} a glassy solid, though some rosins will form crystals, especially when brought into solution. The practical melting point varies with different specimens, some being semi-fluid at the temperature of boiling water, others melting at 100 °C to 120 °C. It is very flammable, burning with a <b>smoky</b> <b>flame,</b> so care should be taken when melting it. It is soluble in alcohol, ether, benzene and chloroform. Rosin consists mainly of abietic acid, and combines with caustic alkalis to form salts (rosinates or pinates) that are known as rosin soaps. In addition to its extensive use in soap making, rosin is largely employed in making varnishes (including fine violin varnishes), sealing wax and various adhesives. It is also used for preparing shoemakers' wax, for pitching lager beer casks, and numerous minor purposes.|$|E
