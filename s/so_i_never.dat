5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, MacFarlane was {{scheduled}} to return to Los Angeles on American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston. Suffering from a hangover after the previous night's celebrations that followed his speech at his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, and with an incorrect departure time (8:15a.m. instead of 7:45a.m.) from his travel agent, he arrived at Logan International Airport about ten minutes too late to board the flight as the gates had been closed. Fifteen minutes after departure, American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked, and at 8:46a.m. it was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing everyone on board. MacFarlane said,The only reason it hasn't really affected me as it maybe could have is I didn't really know that I was in any danger until after it was over, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> had that panic moment. After the fact, it was sobering, but people {{have a lot of}} close calls; you're crossing the street and you almost get hit by a car..... this one just happened to be related to something massive. I really can't let it affect me because I'm a comedy writer. I have to put that {{in the back of my}} head.|$|E
25|$|In the 1928 letter, he recounted what {{happened}} during those early attempts: “At the trials it would start to rise off the ground when a speed of twenty miles an hour was attained. This speed was not sufficient to work the rudders, so, on account of its huge size and low speed, it was uncontrollable, and would spin round broadside directly after it left the ground. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> flew with my first experimental plane, but no-one else did with their first for that matter”.|$|E
25|$|In August 2009, after {{spending}} some time presenting on RTÉ Radio 1, {{it was announced that}} Fanning would be returning to RTÉ 2fm to present his evening weekday show in his old 19:00 slot. The return followed the failure by RTÉ 2fm in its attempts to target teenagers. Fanning claimed: In fact I so never moved that instead I brought the four people who were working with me for Radio One and their desks into 2FM! I never went over to Radio One, I did all my programmes from 2FM, I never moved. I was also doing 2FM every Sunday <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> left at all so I'm just back to my spiritual home Monday to Friday.|$|E
50|$|Phil Taylor {{was great}} {{when he was}} good... <b>so</b> <b>I</b> could <b>never</b> have filled that space. It's like when you {{get married and have}} kids, no one can take my father's place. Of course, some other guy could have taken his place, but he wouldn't have been my father; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> could <b>never</b> be Phil Taylor, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> had to {{introduce}} Mikkey Dee into Motörhead.|$|R

6000|$|Jack waited. The fiery grip of {{the brandy}} relaxed; the genial warmth of it was wafted through him persuasively from head to foot. He took another sip. His eyes began to glitter. [...] "What divine being made this?" [...] he asked. Without waiting to be answered, he tried it again, and emptied the cup. [...] "More!" [...] he cried. [...] "I <b>never</b> felt <b>so</b> big, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> felt <b>so</b> strong, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> felt <b>so</b> clever, as <b>I</b> feel now!" ...|$|R
500|$|A large {{aspect of}} the game is the {{alternative}} history in which it is set, where the Nazis won the Second World War. The team saw this aspect as an opportunity to create everything at a very large scale, with very little limitations; [...] "so many things that we can create, and work with, and expand on. <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> really felt that we were limited," [...] said Öjerfors.|$|E
500|$|In a {{statement}} to The New York Times on August 21, 2015, Dre again addressed his abusive past, stating, [...] "Twenty-five years ago I {{was a young man}} drinking too much and in over my head with no real structure in my life. However, none of this is an excuse for what I did. I've been married for 19 years and every day I'm working to be a better man for my family, seeking guidance along the way. I'm doing everything I can <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> resemble that man again." [...] He went on to apologize to all the women he abused, saying, [...] "I apologize to the women I've hurt. I deeply regret what I did and know that it has forever impacted all of our lives." ...|$|E
500|$|Producer Todd Phillips {{described}} {{the film as}} an experiment, after executive producer Alex Heineman provided a basic concept, with the production team sharing tales of memorable parties that they had either attended or heard about. Writer Michael Bacall developed these stories into an outline scenario in one night {{with the goal of}} creating the [...] "gnarliest high school party of all time". The remainder of the story was fleshed out in the following weeks. Bacall and Drake were told to [...] "go crazy" [...] with the script, although Bacall confessed [...] "I was a nerd in high school <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> did anything like what's in the movie". Bacall worked on the script generally at nights between simultaneously working on the scripts for 21 Jump Street and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.|$|E
60|$|I {{regarded}} {{that as a}} sort of covert intimation that my service {{could be}} dispensed with, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> resigned. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> will be a private secretary to a senator again. You can't please that kind of people. They don't know anything. They can't appreciate a party's efforts.|$|R

500|$|Blanchard {{was born}} on December 11, 1924 in McColl, South Carolina [...] His father was a doctor and had played college {{football}} at Tulane University and Wake Forest University. The Blanchards moved from McColl, South Carolina to Dexter, Iowa in 1929. [...] The Blanchards then moved to Bishopville, South Carolina two years later. [...] Blanchard, nicknamed [...] "Little Doc" [...] due to his father's occupation, attended high school at Saint Stanislaus College in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. He led the school's football team, the Rockachaws, to an undefeated season during his senior year in 1941. Blanchard was recruited to play college football by Army, Fordham University and the University of Notre Dame, among others. Blanchard said in 1985 {{that he had been}} contacted about going to West Point when he was in high school. He said, [...] "At that point in time, I really wasn’t interested. Academically, I never was too hot, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> had any idea I would pass the entrance examination and go to West Point." ...|$|E
500|$|In Ved Vejen, Bang has masterfully {{developed}} his impressionistic style. While recognizing that impressionism was {{first and foremost}} a trend in painting, he explained in a letter sent to Peter Nansen from Prague {{that he was trying to}} achieve the same style in literature: [...] "Impressionistic is indeed the word. I am frantically striving to make every single impression clear and precise and distinctive, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> think about the whole" [...] Jean-Claude Polet adds that while he owes much to Zola, Daudet and Maupassant, he channels naturalism into a quite unexpected direction, that of impressionism. His characters are revealed through their responses or a slight turn of phrase along the lines of the Norwegian Jonas Lie or the Russian Turgenev. He does not explain, he merely presents a picture, providing the reader with impressions, allowing him to read between the lines, interpreting what lies behind the words. On meeting Claude Monet, he was told, [...] "You are the first impressionist writer." [...] A recognized example of his mastery of impressionism is the novel's opening scene where all the characters meet at the station.|$|E
500|$|After {{finishing}} {{the music for}} the album, the band decided that the artwork needed to reflect the themes on the record, likening the change of image to a political campaign. Armstrong recalled, [...] "We wanted to be firing on all cylinders. [...] Everything from the aesthetic to the music to the look. [...] Just everything." [...] Green Day drew inspiration from Chinese communist propaganda art the band saw in art galleries on Melrose Avenue and recruited artist Chris Bilheimer, who had designed the art for the previous records Nimrod and International Superhits! to create the cover. The band aimed for the cover to be [...] "at once uniform and powerful". The album's artwork—"a Posada-stark print of a heart-shaped hand grenade gripped in a blood-soaked fist"—is representative of its political content. After listening to the new music on his computer, Bilheimer took note of the lyric [...] "And she's holding on my heart like a hand grenade" [...] from [...] "She's a Rebel". Influenced by artist Saul Bass's poster for the 1955 drama film The Man with the Golden Arm, Bilheimer created an upstretched arm holding a red heart-shaped grenade. Although he felt that red is the [...] "most overused color in graphic design", {{he felt that the}} [...] "immediate" [...] qualities of the color deemed it appropriate for use on the cover. He explained, [...] "I'm sure there's psychological theories of it being the same color of blood and therefore has the powers of life and death... And as a designer I always feel it's kind of a cop-out, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> used it before. But there was no way you couldn't use it on this cover." ...|$|E

500|$|Azaria played {{composer}} Marc Blitzstein in Tim Robbins' film Cradle Will Rock in 1999. Paul Clinton {{wrote that}} Azaria was [...] "brilliant as the tortured (is {{there any other}} kind) artist Blitzstein." [...] The same year he appeared as author and journalist Mitch Albom alongside Jack Lemmon in the television film Tuesdays with Morrie, winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for the role. Azaria described the latter as the [...] "best work [...] done." [...] These {{were two of the}} first dramatic roles Azaria had taken; throughout his career Azaria has primarily worked in comedy, but tries to balance the two. Azaria commented: [...] "all the roles I got were in comedy at first, and I was certainly happy to get those, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> felt the lack of being considered a dramatic actor because I was so happy to get what I got. And then I became surprised later on when I got dramatic roles. But I never went, 'OK, now it's time to get a dramatic role.'" [...] His next dramatic part was in the television film Uprising in 2001. The film was based on the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and Azaria played Mordechaj Anielewicz, one of the revolt's leaders. Azaria was confused by his casting in Uprising and frequently asked the film's producer and director Jon Avnet why he was selected. [...] "I know [...] liked the fact I was Jewish, and he knew I could do accents well. He cast me and David Schwimmer in , and we were both sort of mystified. He had some instinct that he wanted people who were more known for being funny. He never explained it satisfactorily to me; I don't understand why." [...] His parts in Tuesdays With Morrie and Uprising affected him, causing a depressive state which he countered with DVDs of the comedy series Monty Python. Azaria found Uprising to be [...] "very difficult very depressing very emotionally challenging" [...] material. In 2003, Azaria played journalist Michael Kelly, the former editor of The New Republic, in the drama film Shattered Glass. Kelly died a few months before the film was released and Azaria said the film [...] "has become a weird kind of eulogy to him." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 2007, the British {{government}} announced publicly {{that it was}} abandoning {{the use of the}} phrase [...] "War on Terror" [...] as they found it to be less than helpful. This was explained more recently by Lady Eliza Manningham-Buller. In her 2011 Reith lecture, the former head of MI5 said that the 9/11 attacks were [...] "a crime, not an act of war. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> felt it helpful to refer to a war on terror." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pattinson began {{modelling}} {{at the age}} of 12, but his workload {{began to}} decrease four years later. In December 2008, he blamed the lack of modelling work on his masculine appearance: [...] "When I first started I was quite tall and looked like a girl, so I got lots of jobs, because it was during that period where the androgynous look was cool. Then, I guess, I became too much of a guy, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> got any more jobs. I had the most unsuccessful modelling career." [...] Pattinson appeared in the advertising campaign for Hackett's autumn 2007 collection.|$|E

2500|$|The {{reintroduction}} of Vicki {{was part}} of the producers' plan to reform the Watts family, including the resurrection of Vicki's father Den, who had been presumed dead for 14 years. Discussing working with Leslie Grantham, who played Vicki's [...] "iconic" [...] father Den, Johnson said, [...] "I was 2 when he left EastEnders [...] <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> witnessed the hype surrounding him. I'm very aware of the legend. How could I not be? My only concern was that he should take me seriously [...] It's been fabulous. I can't wait for our scenes to be shown. They're really edgy and no one does edgy better than Leslie. It's been a massive challenge but I think the results are incredibly hard-hitting. EastEnders is becoming more like a serial drama than a soap. It's so well-written." ...|$|E
2500|$|Graham {{always told}} me right early on {{that he would never}} get married. He told me that his life was devastated when his parents split up, and he said {{straight}} out, [...] "Mrs Fox, I'll never get married", <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> expected anything more of him than what did happen. Even when Lana Cantrell came into the scene I was puzzled and I did say to him why all this, and of course we all know it was good publicity. Lana came to the house and I had to go up, and have it all cleaned, ready for her and her party to come one Sunday night. And then on the Monday night, this great big announcement was going to be made that {{he was supposed to be}} engaged to Lana Cantrell. Well, the ratings went through the roof...|$|E
2500|$|In {{part because}} of public {{misunderstanding}} surrounding gothic aesthetics, people in the goth subculture sometimes suffer prejudice, discrimination, and intolerance. As {{is the case with}} members of various other subcultures and alternative lifestyles, outsiders sometimes marginalize goths, either by intention or by accident. Actress Christina Hendricks talked of being bullied as a goth in school and how difficult it was for her to deal with societal pressure: [...] "Kids can be pretty judgmental about people who are different. But instead of breaking down and conforming, I stood firm. That is also probably why I was unhappy. My mother was mortified and kept telling me how horrible and ugly I looked. Strangers would walk by with a look of shock on their face, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> felt pretty. I just always felt awkward". Prejudice moves people into circles of bonding where they share these similar experiences and are accepted. Young goths have to define themselves and learn beauty is an aspect of cultural relativism.|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{motivation}}s, Ringer responded [...] "Honestly, my number-one motivation is my family". While talking about his attitude and upbringing, Ringer mentioned, [...] "A lot of that just comes from my upbringing. I have a tremendous mother and father, I {{grew up in the}} church, I have a very religious family. I’m not all about myself just because I know if it wasn’t for God, I wouldn’t be able {{to go out there and}} compete anyway. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> look at it as a selfish thing—I never want all the attention or want it to be about me, because I never want to get in to a situation where God has to humble me. I know for a fact that I am not doing it by myself; it is because of Him that I can compete over and over again. That’s basically how I grew up. I was blessed and fortunate to have a family like I have." ...|$|E
2500|$|Because of Fitzpatrick's {{desire for}} the {{photograph}} to reflect something of himself, he raised Che's eyes more and added his initial, a reversed [...] "F" [...] on the shoulder. It {{was not until the}} 40th anniversary of Che's death that Fitzpatrick admitted to this fact stating [...] "I’m a bit mischievous, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> told anyone." [...] At this time Fitzpatrick said that [...] "I love the picture and wherever I am in the world, if I see it, I take a photo of it. I always have a chuckle when I see that little 'F'. I know that it's mine." [...] In November 2008, Fitzpatrick announced that he would be signing over the copyright of his Che image to the William Soler Pediatric Cardiology Hospital in Havana, Cuba. In announcing his reason for ensuring all future proceeds would go to the children's hospital, Fitzpatrick stated that [...] "Cuba trains doctors and then sends them around the world … I want their medical system to benefit." [...] Additionally, Fitzpatrick publicized his desire to gift the original artwork to the archive run by Guevara's widow, Aleida March.|$|E
2500|$|The {{new series}} is a {{continuation}} of the old series, with the story continuing after a 20-year break. It does not take the events of the 1990s TV movies [...] or [...] as canon. Instead we find the characters 20 years after the events of the Season 14 cliffhanger. In an interview with UltimateDallas.com, writer/producer Cynthia Cidre was asked to describe the new Dallas. She responded, [...] "I tried to be really, really respectful of the original Dallas because it was really clear to me that the people who love Dallas are [...] Trekkies, really committed to that show and I really did not understand that before, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> wanted to violate anything that had happened in the past. On the other hand that was the past, twenty years had gone by, so at the same time I think we're properly balanced between the characters of Bobby Ewing, J.R. and Sue Ellen. I also have the new cast and it's John Ross and Christopher, the children of Bobby and J.R., and their love interests. Total respect and a balance of old and new." ...|$|E
