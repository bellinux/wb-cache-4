40|$|AbstractThe article {{reports on}} {{the current state of}} the sipunculan fauna of the central and {{southern}} parts of the Barents Sea. The main quantitative parameters (biomass and abundance) of the sipunculan populations are obtained, and the contribution of sipunculids to the total benthos biomass is assessed. The major factors causing long-term variations in <b>Sipunculidae</b> distribution and abundance are evaluated for the area in question. The investigations show that the most commonly encountered sipunculan species are Nephasoma diaphanes diaphanes, N. abyssorum abyssorum and Phascolion strombus strombus. The main contribution to the total benthos biomass comes from the two species most typical of the Barents Sea benthic fauna: Golfingia margaritacea margaritacea and G. vulgaris vulgaris. It is possible that the reduction in Golfingia biomass between the 1970 s and 1990 s, described in the article, is due to changes in the sampling methodology...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{polypeptide}} of Sipunculs nudus {{was prepared}} by papain. The optimum papain enzymolysis process to Sipunculs nudus {{was confirmed by}} means of single factor analysis and orthogonal test, it showed as below: 300 U/g of enzyme addition amount, 50 ℃ of temperature, 60 min of enzymolysis time and pH 7. 0. The clearance rate of hydroxy radical is 95. 42 % according to the optimum process on Sipunculs nudus enzymolysis. The HPLC chromatogram showed that the prepared component of antioxidative active polypeptide according to such condition is single and its molecular weight is 5868. The results of experiment shows that Sipunculs nudus polypeptide have high inoxidizability and high removing free radicals ability. Sipunculs nudus belongs to <b>Sipunculidae</b> of Sipunculoidea, it is called Sipunculus nudus Linnaeus too.

40|$|Antalya Gulf is {{situated}} in the Levantine Sea, the second biggest and most eastern basin in the Mediterranean Sea. This area is an ultra-oligotrophic basin, strongly affected by anthropogenic inputs, in particular in the fishing areas. For this characteristic, in the Levantine Sea, {{there is a strong}} pressure on the natural resources and benthic assemblages. Furthermore, many alien species enter from Suez Canal and are well established in the area. All these pressures are leading to a degradation of the Levantine Sea. For this reason {{it is important to have}} tools to study and monitoring the functioning of the marine ecosystem. Benthic organisms are superior to many other biological groups for their response to environmental stresses. The variability of benthic assemblages on a site can reflect, in an integrative mode, the entire functioning of the marine ecosystem. In this study, that wants to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of the benthic macrofaunal assemblages of Antalya Gulf, 90 benthic species divided in 8 taxa (Annelida, Cnidaria, Echinodermata, Echiura, Mollusca, Porifera, <b>Sipunculida</b> and Tunicata) were found. All the analyses conducted on the entire benthic class and later on Mollusca and Echinodermata separately highlighted the importance of depth on structuring benthic community. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceArchigregarines, {{an early}} {{branching}} lineage within Apicomplexa, are a poorly-known group of invertebrate parasites. By their phylogenetic position, archigregarines {{are an important}} lineage to understand the functional transition that occurred between free-living flagellated predators to obligatory parasites in Apicomplexa. In this study, we provide new ultrastructural data and phylogenies based on SSU rDNA sequences using the type species of archigregarines, the Selenidiidae Selenidium pendula Giard, 1884. We describe {{for the first time}} the syzygy and early gamogony at the ultrastructural level, revealing a characteristic nuclear multiplication with centrocones, cryptomitosis, filamentous network of chromatin, a cyst wall secretion and a 9 + 0 flagellar axoneme of the male gamete. S. pendula belongs to a monophyletic lineage that includes several other related species, all infecting Sedentaria Polychaeta (Spionidae, Sabellaridae, Sabellidae and Cirratulidae). All of these Selenidium species exhibit similar biological characters: a cell cortex with the plasma membrane - inner membrane complex - subpellicular microtubule sets, an apical complex with the conoid, numerous rhoptries and micronemes, a myzocytosis with large food vacuoles, a nuclear multiplication during syzygy and young gamonts. Two other distantly related Selenidium-like lineages infect Terebellidae and <b>Sipunculida,</b> underlying the ability of archigregarines to parasite a wide range of marine hosts...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe first {{description}} of the cleavage program of the palaeonemertean Carinoma tremaphoros (a member of a basal clade of the Nemertea) is illustrated by confocal microscopy and microinjection and compared to development of more derived nemerteans and other eutrochozoans (Annelida, Mollusca, <b>Sipunculida</b> and Echiurida). Lineage tracers were injected into individual blastomeres of C. tremaphoros at the 2 -, 4 -, 8 - and 16 -cell stage. Subsequent development was followed {{to the formation of}} simple (so-called planuliform) planktonic larvae to establish the ultimate fates of the blastomeres. Results of labeling experiments demonstrate that the development of C. tremaphoros bears closer similarity to other Eutrochozoa than development of a previously studied hoplonemertean (Nemertopsis bivittata) and a heteronemertean (Cerebratulus lacteus) in that the first cleavage plane bears an invariant relationship to the plane of bilateral symmetry of the larval body. Additionally, our cell-labeling experiments support the earlier suggestion that the transitory pre-oral belt of cells in the larvae of C. tremaphoros corresponds to the prototroch of other Eutrochozoa. A unique feature of development of C. tremaphoros includes the oblique orientation of the trochal lineages with respect to the anterior–posterior axis of the larva. The significance and application of cleavage characters such as presence of molluscan vs. annelid cross for phylogenetic analyses is reviewed. We argue that molluscan or annelid cross, neither of which are present in nemerteans, are merely two out of much greater variety of patterns created by the differences in the relative size and timing of formation of micromere quartets and none can be considered, by itself, as evidence of close phylogenetic relationship between phyla...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Annelida {{is one of}} {{the major}} protostome phyla, whose deep {{phylogeny}} is very poorly understood. Recent molecular phylogenies show that Annelida may include groups once considered separate phyla (Pogonophora, Echiurida, and <b>Sipunculida)</b> and that Clitellata are derived polychaetes. SThe "total-evidence" analyses combining morphological and molecular characters have been published for a few annelid taxa. No attempt has yet been made to analyse simultaneously morphological and molecular information concerning the Annelida as a whole. Results Phylogenetic relationships within Annelida were analysed on the basis of 93 morphological characters and sequences of six genes (18 S, 28 S, and 16 S rRNA, EF 1 α, H 3, COI), altogether, 87 terminals of all annelid "families" and 3, 903 informative characters, by Bayesian and maximum-parsimony methods. The analysis of the combined dataset yields the following scheme of relationships: Phyllodocida and Eunicida are monophyletic groups, together probably forming monophyletic Aciculata (incl. Orbiniidae and Parergodrilidae that form a sister group of the Eunicida). The traditional "Scolecida" and "Canalipalpata" are both polyphyletic, forming instead two clades: one including Cirratuliformia and the "sabelloid-spionoid clade" (incl. Sternaspis, Sabellidae-Serpulidae, Sabellariidae, Spionida s. str.), the other ("terebelloid-capitelloid clade") including Terebelliformia, Arenicolidae-Maldanidae, and Capitellidae-Echiurida. The Clitellata and "clitellate-like polychaetes" (Aeolosomatidae, Potamodrilidae, Hrabeiella) form a monophyletic group. The position of the remaining annelid groups is uncertain – the most problematic taxa are the Opheliidae-Scalibregmatidae clade, the Amphinomida- Aberranta clade, Apistobranchus, Chaetopteridae, Myzostomida, the Sipunculida-Dinophilidae clade, and the "core Archiannelida" (= Protodrilidae, Nerillidae, Polygordiidae, Saccocirridae). Conclusion The combined ("total-evidence") phylogenetic analysis provides a modified view of annelid evolution, with several higher-level taxa, i. e. Phyllodocida, Eunicida, orbinioid-parergodrilid clade (OPC), Cirratuliformia, sabelloid-spionoid clade (SSC), terebelloid-capitelloid clade (TCC), and "Clitellatomorpha". Two unorthodox clades, the "core Archiannelida" and Sipunculida-Dinophilidae, are proposed. Although the deep-level evolutionary relationships of Annelida remain poorly understood, we propose the monophyly of the Aciculata, sister-group relationships between the Eunicida and OPC, between the Cirratuliformia and SSC, and possibly also between the "Clitellatomorpha" and Oweniidae-Pogonophora clades. </p...|$|R
40|$|During a {{synoptic}} survey {{carried out}} in April-May 1986, 171 localities were sampled in the North Sea as delimited by the Straits of Dover {{in the south and}} approximately by the 100 m isobath in the north. Meiobenthos included Nematoda, Copepoda, Turbellaria, Gastrotricha, Polychaeta, Oligochaeta, Priapulida, Kinorhyncha, Ostracoda, Halacarida, Isopoda, Tanaidacea, Bryozoa, Cnidaria, <b>Sipunculida,</b> Echiurida, Nemertini and Tardigrada. Nematodes were the dominant group in virtually all stations, their densities ranging from 61 to 4167 individuals. 10 cm - 2. Only in the Southern Bight, where nematode numbers were low, did harpacticoids sometimes represent the dominant meiobenthic taxon. There was a tendency for nematode (and total meiobenthos) density to increase towards the north. A total of 278 copepod species belonging to 105 genera and 22 families were identified. Over 40 % of the species were new to science; new taxa were found particularly among the interstitial families which were most important in terms of species diversity. Copepod density decreased rapidly to the north and this trend was followed by diversity. Individual ash-free dry weight (AFDW) was determined for 98 species of copepod. Total biomass reached a peak in the south (low mean individual AFDW, high density) and in the north (high mean individual AFDW, low density), but was low in the Central North Sea where the copepod communities were impoverished both qualitatively and quantitatively. Using the classification technique TWINSPAN (two-way indicator species analysis), it was impossible to define meaningful clusters (TWIN groups) {{on the basis of the}} l 8 major meiobenthic taxa. However, seven distinct communities could be recognized on the basis of the copepod composition: (I) TWIN A largely coincided with the Southern Bight and showed high densities of predominantly interstitial species (Cylindropsyllidae, Paramesochridae, Cyclopinidae) and a few characteristic taxa from coarse sediments; (2) TWIN B was found in the coastal zone of the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark, and in the Dogger Bank, and was dominated by large Ectinosomatidae and Ameiridae, and by interstitial Leptastacidae; (3) TWIN C represented an impoverished community north of the Dogger Bank and consisted of large mud-dwelling species belonging to the Diosaccidae, Laophontidae and Ameiridae; (4) between the Scottish coast and Norwegian Deeps and in the Silver Pits Zosimidae, Cletodidae and Idyanthidae were the most important families (TWIN D); (5) TWIN E grouped the Norwegian Deeps, Devirs Hole and Farne Deep and showed a typical deepwater fauna represented by Ancorabolidae, Cerviniidae, Stenocopiinae and bathyal cletodid genera. Two minor clusters (a, 13) coincided with the Dutch Wadden Sea (1 station) and the river outlets (Thames, Wash, Meuse/Scheldt) whose meiobenthos is subject to pollutants. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) clearly separated the five major twin groups. TWIN A-C were significantly correlated with sediment and could be arranged along a gradient of decreasing median grain size and increasing silt/clay content. TWIN D was clearly related to latitude whilst TWIN E showed a clear preference for depth...|$|R
