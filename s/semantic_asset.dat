40|$|Semantic {{assets and}} the {{agreements}} {{associated with them}} are essential elements for organisations to {{understand the meaning of}} the information they exchange – without them this information would be of little use. In order to facilitate the access of public administrations in Europe to reusable semantic assets, the Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administrations Programme of the European Commission (ISA Programme) has been running for the last 3 years an action on syndicating content from different <b>semantic</b> <b>asset</b> repositories and making it available through a single point of access. In this paper we present {{the current state of the}} federation of <b>semantic</b> <b>asset</b> repositories on Joinup, namely a set of online collections of semantic assets maintained by public administrations, standardisation organisations and businesses, which currently counts more than 1500 semantic assets from 21 partner organisations, described using the Asset Description Metadata Schema (ADMS) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{heterogeneity}} {{of the environment}} in which data exchange happens is creating many challenges during the execution of digital public services across Europe. Lack of agreement and guidance on the meaning and format of information to be exchanged between Member States are the main stumbling block. Semantic interoperability is jeopardized by different interpretations of the information exchanged between people and applications, thus hampering the effective and efficient creation of new European public services. In an attempt to promote the use of common models and standards, governments develop e-Government metadata repositories to store semantic data models, taxonomies, codelists and reference data making them openly available for reuse. The term <b>semantic</b> <b>asset</b> has been devised to refer to these types of resources. However, these repositories differ in their scope, target group, implementation technologies and end-user interfaces. Although, the semantic content they include can often be reused, their physical isolation and the {{heterogeneity of}} the assets hamper the reusability of common concepts and cross-repository search. To deal with these challenges, this paper specifies a generic Exchange API that capitalizes on Linked Data technologies and REST in order to enable the semantic integration of distributed metadata repositories, thus creating a flexible federation which facilitates cross-repository querying and consequently enhances <b>semantic</b> <b>asset</b> reusability...|$|E
50|$|Organisations use <b>semantic</b> <b>assets</b> {{to share}} {{information}} and knowledge (within themselves and with others). <b>Semantic</b> <b>assets</b> are usually very valuable and reusable elements {{for the development of}} Information Systems, in particular, as part of machine-to-machine interfaces. As enablers to interoperable information exchange, <b>semantic</b> <b>assets</b> are usually created, published and maintained by standardisation bodies. Nonetheless, ICT projects and groups of experts also create such assets. There are therefore many publishers of <b>semantic</b> <b>assets</b> with different degrees of formalism.|$|R
50|$|Joinup {{might even}} be {{compared}} to the Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network (CKAN). However, this focuses not on software packages or <b>semantic</b> <b>assets,</b> but on the storage and distribution of data, such as spreadsheets and the contents of databases.|$|R

50|$|Used {{in concert}} with web {{syndication}} technology ADMS helps people {{make sense of the}} complex multi-publisher environment around standards and in particular the ones which are <b>semantic</b> <b>assets</b> such as ontologies, data models, data dictionaries, code lists, XML and RDF schemas. In spite of their importance, standards are not easily discoverable on the web via search engines because metadata about them is seldom available. Navigating on the websites of the different publishers of standards is not efficient either.|$|R
40|$|About {{two thirds}} of the energy {{consumed}} in buildings originates from household appliances. Nowadays, appliances are often intelligent and networked devices that form complete energy consuming, producing, and managing systems. Reducing energy consumption is therefore a matter of managing and optimizing the energy utilization on a system level. These systems need standardized interfaces on a sensor and device level. Many of the required standards already exist, but a common architecture does not, resulting in a market which is too fragmented and powerless. We have designed a reference ontology for these appliances, and this deliverable presents the results of the study. We have identified 47 different <b>semantic</b> <b>assets</b> that describe various properties of smart appliances in residential environments. We translated 23 of the 47 <b>semantic</b> <b>assets</b> into ontologies in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). In the 23 ontologies created we identified 20 recurring concepts that we used as initial building blocks for the Smart Appliances Reference (SAREF) ontology. We mapped the recurring concepts from the assets to the SAREF ontology to allow for translations between the 23 ontologies that we created. Next to that we showed how the SAREF ontology can be applied in relation to the ETSI M 2 M Architecture...|$|R
40|$|About {{two thirds}} of the energy {{consumed}} by buildings originates from the residential sectors and thus household appliances. Household appliances or home appliances are electrical/mechanical machines which accomplish some household functions. Nowadays, appliances are not stand-alone systems anymore. They are often highly intelligent (“smart”) and networked devices, that form complete energy consuming, producing, and managing systems. Reducing the use of energy and production of greenhouse gasses is therefore not only a matter of increasing the efficiency of the individual devices, but managing and optimizing the energy utilization on a system level. The systems will therefore inevitably consist of devices and sensors from different vendors, and open interfaces enabling further extensions. The interfaces need to be properly standardized and offer external access on a semantic level both to any manageable and controllable function of the system as a whole, and to any device {{that is part of the}} system. However, the problem is not the lack of available standards. Actually, there already exist many standards, too many really, all dealing with a smaller or larger part of the problem, sometimes overlapping and competing. Various workshops and projects already explored this field and concluded that defining a useful and applicable reference data model should in principle be possible. One single, reference ontology could be created to cover the needs of all appliances relevant for energy efficiency, and it can be expanded to cover future intelligence requirements. The European Commission therefore issued a tender for a Study on “Available Semantics Assets for the Interoperability of Smart Appliances. Mapping into a Common Ontology as a M 2 M Application Layer Semantics”, defining 3 tasks: Task 1 : Take stock of existing <b>semantic</b> <b>assets</b> and use case assets Task 2 : Perform a translation exercise of each model (or use case) to a common ontology language and a mapping or matching exercise between all the models  Task 3 : Propose a reference ontology and document the ontology into the ETSI M 2 M architectur...|$|R
40|$|FORM, {{which was}} {{developed}} at Pohand University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) in South Korea, is a systematic method that looks for and captures commonalities and variabilities {{of a product}} line in terms of “features”. The results of the analysis are used to develop reusable product line assets (architectures and components). This method includes techniques and tools for product line engineering but has a loose structure since it does not provide guidance to reuse and rigorously analyze its assets. This paper extends the <b>semantic</b> of FORM <b>assets</b> in order to specify conceptual reusable business components in FORM. For this purpose, we used the model proposed by Ramadour, which introduces the notion of “context” to guide conception and reuse of business components. The Z notation is used to {{provide a framework for}} rigorous analysis of the reusable business components produced...|$|R

The architecting process leading to this document followed the Architectural reference Model methodology promoted by the IoT-A project (FP 7 “light house” project on Architecture for the Internet of Things). It therefore consists of a set of Views that are in tern dealing with “logical” functional decomposition (Functional View - FV), data structuring and annotation, data flows and inter-functional Component interactions (Information View - IV) and ultimately the deployment of those logical components onto concrete software components (Deployment View). Design Choices pertaining to Non-Functional requirements will be covered in the up-coming WP deliverables providing detailed interfaces description that will guide he implemented work on each WP. The architecture describe din this document is inclusive in the sense it can accommodate under its federation a large number of test-beds with various capabilities (some being semantic-enabled already, some not). It offers full <b>semantic</b> interoperability: all <b>assets</b> of the test-bed (resources, IoT Services, Virtual Entities) are semantically annotated and described; they are searchable using either powerful data query languages or simpler APIs. FIESTA-IoT is therefore able to offer the greatest test-bed agnostic experience to both expert users (semantically skilled) and more basic experimenters as well...|$|R
