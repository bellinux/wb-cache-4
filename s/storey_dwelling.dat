25|$|For {{many years}} the Cadbury-Browns had a holiday home near the Suffolk town of Aldeburgh. Cadbury-Brown had {{designed}} a studio for Benjamin Britten {{in the early}} days of the Aldeburgh Festival and Britten had acquired a site opposite the parish church to build an opera house upon it. When this idea did not come to fruition, Britten converted the maltings at Snape and Cadbury-Brown bought the site. Seeing that the site already had a single <b>storey</b> <b>dwelling</b> on it he knew that it had potential and together with his wife they designed a new home. After the house was completed in 1964 he sold part of the garden to Britten's colleague, the musician Imogen Holst and designed a house for her too. In 2000 the original house was Grade 2 Listed.|$|E
500|$|Carl Michael Bellman {{was born}} on 4February 1740 in the Stora Daurerska house, {{which was one of}} the finest in the Södermalm {{district}} of Stockholm. The house was the property of his maternal grandmother, Catharina von Santen, who had brought up his father, orphaned as a small child. Carl Michael's parents were Johan Arndt Bellman, a civil servant, and Catharina Hermonia, daughter of the priest of the local Maria parish. Her family was wholly Swedish, whereas Johan's family had German origins: they had come from Bremen in about 1660. When Carl Michael was four the family moved to a smaller, single <b>storey</b> <b>dwelling</b> called the Lilla Daurerska house. He briefly went to a local school, but was educated mainly by private tutors. He was the eldest of 15 children who lived long enough for their births to be registered. His parents had intended him to become a priest, but he fell ill with a fever, and on recovering found he could express any thought in rhyming verse. His parents appointed a tutor called Ennes who Bellman called [...] "a genius". Bellman was taught French, German, Italian, English and Latin. He read Horace and Boileau; Ennes taught him to write poetry and to translate French and German hymns. He was familiar with stories from the Bible including the Apocrypha, many of which found their way into the songs he composed in later life. However, expenses including the Swedish tradition of hospitality left the family with no money to start him off in life with a journey to the south of Europe, such as to Spain to visit his uncle, Jacob Martin Bellman, who was the Swedish Consul in Cádiz. Carl Michael translated a French book by Du Four and dedicated it to his uncle, but the hint was ignored. Deep in debt, at the end of 1757 the family sent Carl Michael to the State Bank as an unpaid trainee. He had no aptitude for numbers, instead discovering the taverns and brothels which were to figure so largely in his songs.|$|E

40|$|This article applies Bourdieu’s {{analysis}} {{of the formation of}} the “scholastic habitus” in medieval times, elaborated in his 1967 afterword to his French translation of Erwin Panofsky’s Gothic Architecture and Scholasticism (2005 [1967]), to a different historical case and social context, namely the correspondence between indigenous mental categories and architectural efflorescence in a city of the contemporary Andes: El Alto. This same principle of homology between mental categories and building layout (rooted in a common habitus) can be used to interpret one of the most spectacular characteristics of “emerging architectures” known as chalets in Bolivia. The term chalet designates a hybrid structure consisting of a penthouse and <b>storey</b> <b>dwelling</b> built on the rooftops. The chalets are architectural forms embedded within an economy of symbolic goods characterized by a “dual truth”: they are at once material and symbolic; they perform economic functions {{while at the same time}} seeking conspicuous exposure and public visibility. The hypothesis developed here is that the conspicuous lifestyle revealed by the construction of chalets on the rooftops can be understood by reference to the emerging social power of the indigenous (cholos) elites. This article thus identifies in the fraternities of El Alto the structural equivalent of the scholastic institution that Bourdieu associated with Gothic architecture, in order to reveal the formation of a specific habitus, shared among urban categories defined by similar residential locations, economic activities and forms of collective organization...|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} {{the state of}} the art and perspectives of the Finnish builders’ carpentry Industry and the role of the small firms. It is identified that firms producing prefabricated components to BtoC markets do not supply their products to BtoB markets and vice versa. Domestic markets of single dwelling house construction have been growing during the recent years. There is a large demand potential opening up by the replacment of concrete by wood in the frame construction for multi <b>storey</b> <b>dwelling</b> buildings. The competitive structure of the industry as one determinant of business performance is evaluated with respect to suppliers (supply chain), entrants (entry barriers), buyers, rivals and substitutes. Despite of high cost, differentiation is used by firms in the industry as the major competitive strategy. Lack of knowledge and skills in strategic management, low innovativeness and low marketing competencies are common. Exports do not show any positive impact on business performance. Human capital rather than technology is a strategic but scarce resource. Subcontracting is common but partnerships in production and procurement are rare. There is large variation in the degree of process integration. Differentiation strategy, i. e. broadening competitive scope, implies flexible manufacturing systems with sufficient manufacturing capacity and a sufficient number of product variants. Small firms encounter restrictions with respect to the endowment of human and financial capital. At the end the {{article presents}} some factors of success for small firms in the Finnish builders’ carpentry industry. Differentiation strategy hardly does provide a competitive advantage for small firms without extended networking. Business networking can allow small firms to compensate scale disadvantages when focusing into narrow demand segments. The preconditions for small firms to enter a BtoB partnership with a construction company are process automation and exploitation of IT-technologies, integrated information management and the implementation of an open construction system. ...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} the prediction of the activation times of domestic ionisation and photoelectric smoke detectors within a two <b>storey</b> <b>dwelling,</b> the work undertaken being an extension to that previously presented by Brammer (2002). Three fire scenarios are considered, each having been a real test fire undertaken at the Building Research Establishment in Cardington. These three fire scenarios all involved the flaming combustion of an upholstered armchair within the lounge on the Ground floor. During the experiments various results were recorded, including temperatures, optical densities and smoke detector activation times. The fire scenarios where modelled using FDS, Version 5. Base parameters regarding the fuel load where defined to be 0. 05 kgsoot/kgfuel and 20 MJ/kg. Consideration was also given to the effect varying the effective heat of combustion and defined soot yield would have on derived smoke detector activation times. Additional simulations where thus run considering soot yields of 0. 04 kgsoot/kgfuel and 0. 10 ksoot/kgfuel, and an effective heat of combustion of 25 MJ/kg. Three prediction methods where applied to the results of the FDS simulations for derivation of the activation times of smoke detectors located throughout the house. These methods where the temperature correlation method, Heskestad’s method, and Cleary’s method. The temperature correlation method considered activation criterions of 4 °C, 13 °C and 20 °C above ambient. The Heskestad and Cleary methods were found to derive comparable activation times for each detector location. None of the prediction algorithms where however found to predict activation times consistently comparable to the test data. Rather, it was determined that for an appropriate prediction method to be adopted for accurate assessment of a given fire scenario, consideration must be given to the: •	type of detector being assessed; •	location of the detector relative to the fire; •	mode of combustion (i. e. flaming or smouldering); and the •	growth rate of the fire...|$|E

40|$|The {{demographic}} change in Germany {{has a lot}} of characteristics and aspects; occasionally it affects the different property submarkets. Especially the supply-to-demand ratio is changing {{as a result of the}} overall declining population in Germany and also as a result of the change of composition of the population. Additionally, there is an increase in single- or two-person households, whereas the number of households with three or more members decreases. Due to the resultant changed requirements of use, consumption, residential property and liv-ing environment, vacancies occur in the different submarkets of the property market as a con-sequence of oversupply. At the same time the residential buildings and retail buildings do generally not comply with today’s standards. In many cases the buildings are not refurbished and equipped modern. Distressed properties are especially multi <b>storey</b> <b>dwellings,</b> residential buildings in high-frequency streets or residential buildings in rural areas. This problem of vacancy can also affect the value of buildings; sometimes it can even affect adjacent buildings, and finally, can have negative effects on the entire residential quarter.
