To achieve a quantitative description of these complicated processes, an atomistic and generic theory taking into account the reaction environment, particle size and morphology, and metal-support interaction is developed. It includes (1) energetics of <b>supported</b> <b>metal</b> particles, (2) formation of monomers (both the metal adatoms and metal-reactant complexes) on supports, and (3) corresponding sintering rate equations and total activation energies, in the presence of reactants at arbitrary temperature and pressure. The thermodynamic criteria for the reactant assisted Ostwald ripening and induced disintegration are formulated, and the influence of reactants on sintering kinetics and redispersion are mapped out. Most energetics and kinetics barriers in the theory can be obtained conveniently by first-principles theory calculations. This allows for the rapid exploration of sintering and disintegration of <b>supported</b> <b>metal</b> particles in huge phase space of structures and compositions under various reaction environments. General strategies of suppressing the sintering of the <b>supported</b> <b>metal</b> particles and facilitating the redispersions of the low surface area catalysts are proposed. The theory is applied to TiO 2 (110) supported Rh particles in the presence of carbon monoxide, and reproduces well the broad temperature, pressure, and particle size range over which the sintering and redispersion occurred in such experiments. The result also highlights the importance of the metal-carbonyl complexes as monomers for Ostwald ripening and disintegration of <b>supported</b> <b>metal</b> catalysts in the presence of CO...|$|R

50|$|The site is {{composed}} of upland moorland ridges and plateau, above a number of north to south falling watercourses - between the River Nent {{to the west and}} slightly eastwards, the River West Allen; and then between the River West Allen and the River East Allen. The site is at elevations from circa 400 m along the northerly boundaries, to circa 600 m and above on the southern boundary.

Underlying the mire is Carboniferous limestone, with abundant lichen-rich outcrops.

50|$|Among many {{advanced}} electrochemical {{energy storage}} devices, rechargeable lithium-air batteries are of particular interest due to their considerable energy storing capacities and high power densities. As the battery is being used, lithium ions combine with oxygen from the air to form particles of lithium oxides, which attach to carbon fibers on the electrode. During recharging, the lithium oxides separate again into lithium and oxygen which is released back into the atmosphere. This conversion sequence is highly inefficient because there is significant voltage difference of more than 1.2 volts between the output voltage and the charging voltage of the battery meaning that approximately 30% of the electrical energy is lost as heat when the battery is charging. Also the large volume changes resulting from continuous conversion of oxygen between its gaseous and solid state puts stress on the electrode and limits its lifetime. The performance of these batteries depends {{on the characteristics of}} the material that makes up the cathode. Carbon materials have been widely used as cathodes because of their excellent electrical conductivities, large surface areas, and chemical stability. Especially relevant for lithium-air batteries, carbon materials act as substrates for <b>supporting</b> <b>metal</b> oxides. Binder-free electrospun carbon nanofibers are particularly good potential candidates to be used in electrodes in lithium-oxygen batteries because they have no binders, have open macroporous structures, have carbons that support and catalyze the oxygen reduction reactions, and have versatility.|$|E

40|$|Background/Aim. Medial open wedge tibial {{osteotomy}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely accepted method of treatment for varus knee deformity in younger patient population. Its success depends on the quality of fixation and preservation of the outer cortex of the tibia. The aim of the study was to evaluate stress distribution in five numerically designed plate configurations which can be used in open wedge tibial osteotomy. Methods. The paper describes the 3 D numerical model of the tibia with 10 ° varus deformity correction obtained by an optical scanner ATOS. The simulation anticipated axial compressive loads of 700 N, 1 400 N and 2 100 N. We used a modification of the standard T-plate in all of the five tested models. Modalities were tested with and without a metal block, and with and without a stable angle fixation plates and screws. Software PAK was used in the analysis of stress distribution. Results. With exception for the standard T-plate configuration without the supporting block, the loads up to 1400 N did not result in critical stresses on the outer cortex of the tibia in the remaining four models. There is an objective risk of possible failure of the outer cortex and loss of correction at a load of 2100 N in all configurations. The plate model with the angle stable fixation and the <b>supporting</b> <b>metal</b> block showed the most optimal distribution of stresses on the plate-bone composite compared to other models. Conclusion. The standard T-plate configuration without <b>supporting</b> <b>metal</b> block is not sufficient to stabilize the open wedge osteotomy of the tibia.
