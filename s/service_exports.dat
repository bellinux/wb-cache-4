50|$|The {{service sector}} is {{probably}} the most liberalized of the sectors. Liberalization offers the opportunity for the sector to compete internationally, contributing to GDP growth and generating foreign exchange. As such, <b>service</b> <b>exports</b> {{are an important part of}} many developing countries' growth strategies. India's IT services have become globally competitive as many companies have outsourced certain administrative functions to countries where costs are lower. Furthermore, if service providers in some developing economies are not competitive enough to succeed on world markets, overseas companies will be attracted to invest, bringing with them international best practices and better skills and technologies. The entry of foreign service providers is not necessarily a negative development and can lead to better services for domestic consumers, improve the performance and competitiveness of domestic service providers, as well as simply attract FDI/foreign capital into the country. In fact, some research suggest a 50% cut in service trade barriers over a five- to ten-year period would create global gains in economic welfare of around $250 billion per annum.|$|E

There is no net foreign debt as other countries owe more money to Denmark than Denmark owes to them, but because of large deficits due to increased unemployment levels the central government has increased its debt level {{since the end of}} September 2008, when it stood at 21 percent (gross debt) of GDP, according to the central bank - in accordance with the Eurostat EMU- gross debt numbers, which only take liabilities into account.

Within the European Union, Denmark advocates a liberal trade policy. It is a society based on consensus (dialogue and compromise) with the Danish Confederation of Trade Unions and the Confederation of Danish Employers in 1899 in Septemberforliget (The September Settlement) recognising each other's right to organise, thus, negotiate. The employer's right to hire and fire their employees whenever they find it necessary is recognised. There is no legally-stipulated minimum wage (minimumsløn) set by the government; the minimum of wages (mindsteløn) is determined by negotiations between the organisations of employers and employees.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the most}} unusual {{features}} of the Indian economic development model has been that India’s GDP growth has been driven by domestic demand and consumption. From 1980 to 2002, India’s economy grew at 6% per year and at 7.5% from 2002 to 2006. Today, domestic consumption accounts for 64% of India’s GDP as opposed to 58% for Europe, 55% for Japan and 42% for China. Morgan Stanley’s Stephen Roach comments that “India’s consumption-led approach to growth may be better balanced than the resource-mobilization model of China.” [...] Booming domestic demand and consumption has allowed Indian firms to diversify from export-led growth and hedge against global fluctuations in consumer demand as well as has created a vibrant middle class in India, of almost 250 million people. One {{of the most}} potent critiques of the Washington Consensus based economic development model {{is that it does not}} cater to the middle class and creates widening gaps between the richest and poorest in the economy. While India is still a hugely unequal country, its Gini Index (that measures income inequality) is 33 on a scale of 0-100, as compared to 41 for the US, 45 for China and 59 for Brazil. A large component of this reduced income inequality is due to India’s growth being driven by domestic demand and consumption by the middle class.Another extremely unusual feature of the Indian model is that it has not followed Rostow’s traditional model of moving from an agrarian economy to a low-skilled manufacturing economy to high-tech manufacturing and finally, a service economy. While China’s success has largely been based on moving from an agrarian economy to mass manufacturing of cheap goods that are exported to the West, India has almost skipped the middle step of creating a strong manufacturing base and directly invested in becoming a service economy. While there are strong manufacturing industries in India, a lot of them are concentrated around high-tech manufacturing. Propelled by the availability of skilled human capital, India’s services sector has grown at 7.5% from 1991 to 2000 and now consists of 55% of India’s GDP. [...] Information technology and business process outsourcing are among the fastest growing sectors, having a cumulative growth rate of revenue 33.6% between 1997-98 and 2002-03 and contributing to 25% of the country's total exports in 2007-08. The growth in the IT sector is attributed to increased specialization, and an availability of a large pool of low cost, highly skilled, educated and fluent English-speaking workers, on the supply side, matched on the demand side by increased demand from foreign consumers interested in India's <b>service</b> <b>exports,</b> or those looking to outsource their operations. The share of the Indian IT industry in the country's GDP increased from 4.8% in 2005-06 to 7% in 2008.
