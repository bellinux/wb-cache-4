40|$|This diploma thesis {{discusses}} {{the school system}} and school catering in the German federal state Hesse with regard to an integration of organic food. Specifically, the potential as well as limitations for the integration of organic food in <b>school</b> <b>meals</b> are considered. The German federal states {{are responsible for the}} organisation and administration of the German school system. Their policy of the recent years induced a rise of all-day schools, which have to offer warm meals for their pupils. Healthy <b>school</b> <b>meals</b> and the use of organic food can have a positive influence on the eating behaviour of pupils, which indicates the high importance of this issue. The organisation of <b>school</b> <b>meals</b> is characterized by heterogeneous structures with varying responsibilities and different ways of implementation. The <b>school</b> <b>meals</b> are mostly prepared by externals – only a few schools manage the preparation by themselves. So far there have been no legal guidelines in Hesse that regulate the quality of <b>school</b> <b>meals</b> or the implementation of organic food. A political programme in Hesse called „Schule und Gesundheit“ (S & G) takes steps to ensure the quality and healthy aspects of the <b>school</b> <b>meals</b> in voluntary <b>schools.</b> However, this programme affects {{only a small number of}} schools so far. But it can be expected that more and more schools will implement these steps in the future. The usage of quality standards, health promotion and the integration of organic food primarily depends on the interests and individual initiatives of the local agents. Therefore the federal state government and the municipalities should be requested to create mandatory conditions. In some communities adequate regulations have already been initiated. The results of this thesis show that many schools are already along their way to regarding quality standards, healthy aspects and organic food. However, there is still a high need of support and advice in the new field of <b>school</b> <b>meals.</b> The coordination centre for <b>school</b> <b>meals</b> in Hesse and a campaign for organic food in the catering of children and young adults play an important role to achieve this goal. Nevertheless, a higher availability of personal advice would be helpful to meet the strong need for support. Expanding the capacities of the responsible agents can be seen as one of the most important steps as an intelligent planning of the <b>school</b> <b>meals</b> is a necessary basis for a successful integration of organic food. Strategies for the future should aim at increasing the sensitivity of the responsible agents when it comes to <b>school</b> <b>meals</b> and reduce common prejudices, especially those regarding the price of organic food. Municipal school projects for organic food in <b>school</b> <b>meals</b> and an effective communication would be helpful for a further progress. Moreover, strategies have to be developed to increase pupils’ acceptance of <b>school</b> <b>meals</b> and to ensure a discussion about organic food in school lessons...|$|R

The <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> is used as a pedagogical tool for teaching table manners, food culture, nutrition, and healthy eating habits, as well as for increasing the consumption of vegetables, fruits and berries, full corn bread, and skimmed or low-fat milk. One of the basic lessons is cooperation between students, head teachers, teachers, parents, and catering staff. In many schools, students participate {{in the work of the}} school canteen during their working life practice period. Most schools have a <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> committee where students, teachers, and catering staff develop school catering together. Most schools also welcome parents to come and taste school meals. There are always adults present in the school restaurant. The pedagogical role of the school catering staff is seen as important, as is teachers' knowledge of nutrition. In 2009, Finland began developing <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> and nutrition education for teachers, and pedagogical education for school catering personnel.|$|E

The most advanced systems of <b>school</b> <b>meals</b> include those in Finland and Sweden, where all <b>school</b> <b>meals</b> are fully funded by the government. In 2014 first {{children between the ages of}} five and seven received a free school lunch in The United Kingdom. In England, <b>school</b> <b>meals</b> have increased their level due to the fact that renowned chef Jamie Oliver noticed how poor quality <b>school</b> <b>meals</b> had. The Jamie Oliver Food Foundation was founded in 2002 and run three core food education programmes in schools. Recently, a very interesting topic is organic food in <b>school</b> <b>meals,</b> and less use of convenient food. Italy has become a pioneer in Europe to use organic and local products in <b>school</b> <b>meals.</b> 40 % of their served food has an organic origin. Across France are all vending machines banned from school since 2005. Countries which do not have compulsory system of school catering services are e. g. Norway, Netherlands and Belgium.
