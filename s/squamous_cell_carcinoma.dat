This is especially relevant for cancers on the nose, ears, eyelids or lips, where surgery may cause disfigurement or require extensive reconstruction.

Cancer of the skin is common in dark-colored dogs, with the most frequently occurring varieties being melanoma of the limbs and digits, and <b>squamous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> of the digit.

40|$|Linkage {{studies of}} kindreds with the nevoid basal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> {{syndrome}} {{and the high}} frequency of chromosome 9 allele loss in sporadic basal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> indicate that chromosome 9 may contain tumor suppressor genes important {{in the development of}} sporadic and familial basal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> The recent mapping of the Ferguson-Smith syndrome, which predisposes affected individuals to the development of multiple lesions histologically indistinguishable from <b>squamous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> suggests that tumor suppressor genes on 9 q may also be important in the development of <b>squamous</b> <b>cell</b> neoplasms of the skin. Fifty-four non-melanoma skin cancers (24 basal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> 14 <b>squamous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> and 16 cases of Bowen's disease) were examined for loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 9. Allelic loss at one or more loci on chromosome 9 was observed in 14 of 24 basal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> four of 14 <b>squamous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> and three of 16 cases of Bowen's disease.

40|$|Acquired {{chromosomal}} aberrations, including gene {{copy number}} alterations, {{are involved in}} the development and progression of human malignancies. SOX 2, a transcription factor-coding gene located at 3 q 26. 33, is known to be recurrently and specifically amplified in <b>squamous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> of the lung, the esophagus, and the oral cavity. In these organs, the SOX 2 protein {{plays an important role in}} tumorigenesis and tumor survival. The aim of this study was to determine whether SOX 2 amplification is also found in <b>squamous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> in other organs commonly affected by this tumor entity. In addition, we examined a large spectrum of lung cancer entities with neuroendocrine differentiation (ie, small cell cancers, large cell cancers, typical and atypical carcinoids) for SOX 2 and TTF 1 copy number gains to reveal potential molecular ties to <b>squamous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> or adenocarcinomas of the lung. Applying fluorescence in situ hybridization, we assessed <b>squamous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> of the cervix uteri (n = 47), the skin (n = 57), and the penis (n = 53) for SOX 2 copy number alterations and detected amplifications in 28 %, 28 %, and 32 % of tumors, respectively. Furthermore, we performed immunohistochemical SOX 2 staining and found that SOX 2 amplification is significantly associated with overexpression of the corresponding protein in <b>squamous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> (P <. 001). Of the lung cancer entities with neuroendocrine differentiation, only small cell cancers and large cell cancers exhibited SOX 2 or TTF 1 amplifications at significant frequencies, indicating that at least a subset of these might be dedifferentiated forms of <b>squamous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> or adenocarcinomas of the lung.

Hence, the aim {{of the present study was}} to examine the expression of IGF- 1 R in normal oral mucosa, fibroepithelial polyps, dysplastic oral mucosa and well-differentiated <b>squamous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> Materials and methods: A 3 -layered streptavidin peroxidase immunohistochemical method was used to detect the expression of IGF- 1 R in normal oral mucosa, fibroepithelial polyps, dysplastic oral mucosa and well-differentiated <b>squamous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> Results: All <b>squamous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> (15 out of 15 patients) showed intense immunoreactivity for IGF- 1 R. Moderate immunoreactivity was seen in dysplastic oral lesions (12 out of 12 lesions) with positive staining in the prickle cell layer. The staining distribution in the benign lesions (14 out of 14 lesions) was weaker and similar to that seen in normal oral mucosa (10 out of 10 samples) when compared to <b>squamous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> and dysplastic lesions. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate increased IGF- 1 receptor expression in oral <b>squamous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> which suggests that IGF- 1 may have an important role in the development of oral cancer.

40|$|Oesophageal cancers are {{prominent}} worldwide; however, {{there are few}} targeted therapies and survival rates for these cancers remain dismal. Here we performed a comprehensive molecular analysis of 164 carcinomas of the oesophagus derived from Western and Eastern populations. Beyond known histopathological and epidemiologic distinctions, molecular features differentiated oesophageal <b>squamous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> from oesophageal adenocarcinomas. Oesophageal <b>squamous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> resembled <b>squamous</b> carcinomas of other organs {{more than they did}} oesophageal adenocarcinomas. Our analyses identified three molecular subclasses of oesophageal <b>squamous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> but none showed evidence for an aetiological role of human papillomavirus. <b>Squamous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> showed frequent genomic amplifications of CCND 1 and SOX 2 and/or TP 63, whereas ERBB 2, VEGFA and GATA 4 and GATA 6 were more commonly amplified in adenocarcinomas. Oesophageal adenocarcinomas strongly resembled the chromosomally unstable variant of gastric adenocarcinoma, suggesting that these cancers could be considered a single disease entity.

Methods and resultsTwo TMAs from formalin-fixed tissue samples, including 300 adenocarcinomas and 177 <b>squamous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> with clinical follow-up data, were analysed. MALDI-MSI analysis revealed 72 distinct mass per charge (m/z) signals associated with tumour cells, 48 of which were found in <b>squamous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> only, and 12 of which were specific for adenocarcinomas. In adenocarcinomas, six signals were linked to early-stage (pT 1 -T 2) tumours (two signals) and the presence (one signal) or absence (three signals) of lymph node metastasis. In <b>squamous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> 24 signals were strongly linked to different phenotypic features, including tumour stage (four signals), histological grade (four signals), and lymph node metastasis (three signals).
