5|$|At the <b>subsolar</b> <b>point</b> the {{bow shock}} stands 1900km (0.3 Rv, where Rv is the radius of Venus) {{above the surface}} of Venus. This {{distance}} was measured in 2007 near the solar activity minimum. Near the solar activity maximum it can be several times further from the planet. The magnetopause {{is located at the}} altitude of 300km. The upper boundary of the ionosphere (ionopause) is near 250km. Between the magnetopause and ionopause there exists a magnetic barrier—a local enhancement of the magnetic field, which prevents solar plasma from penetrating deeper into the Venusian atmosphere, at least near solar activity minimum. The magnetic field in the barrier reaches up to 40nT. The magnetotail continues up to ten radiuses from the planet. It is the most active part of the Venusian magnetosphere. There are reconnection events and particle acceleration in the tail. The energies of electrons and ions in the magnetotail are around 100eV and 1000eV respectively.|$|E
5|$|Venus has an {{extended}} ionosphere located at altitudes 120–300km. The ionosphere almost {{coincides with the}} thermosphere. The high levels of the ionization are maintained only over the dayside of the planet. Over the nightside the concentration of the electrons is almost zero. The ionosphere of Venus consists of three layers: v1 between 120 and 130km, v2 between 140 and 160km and v3 between 200 and 250km. There may be an additional layer near 180km. The maximum electron volume density (number of electrons in a unit of volume) 3m−3 is reached in the v2 layer near the <b>subsolar</b> <b>point.</b> The upper boundary of the ionosphere—ionopause is located at altitudes 220–375km and separates the plasma of the planetary origin {{from that of the}} induced magnetosphere. The main ionic species in the v1 and v2 layers is O2+ ion, whereas the v3 layer consists of O+ ions. The ionospheric plasma is observed to be in motion; solar photoionization on the dayside, and ion recombination on the nightside, are the processes mainly responsible for accelerating the plasma to the observed velocities. The plasma flow appears to be sufficient to maintain the nightside ionosphere at or near the observed median level of ion densities.|$|E

The “hot pole” at 180° lies within the Tolstoj quadrangle; at perihelion, equatorial temperatures {{range from about}} 100 K at local midnight to 700 K at local noon. This daily range of 600 K is greater than that on any other body in the solar system.|$|R

25|$|As with Earth's magnetosphere, the {{boundary}} separating the solar wind's plasma from that within Saturn's magnetosphere {{is called the}} magnetopause. The magnetopause distance from the planet's center at the <b>subsolar</b> <b>point</b> varies widely from 16 to 27Rs (Rs=60,330km is the equatorial radius of Saturn). The magnetopause's position depends on the pressure exerted by the solar wind, which in turn depends on solar activity. The average magnetopause standoff distance is about 22Rs. In front of the magnetopause (at the distance of about 27Rs from the planet) lies the bow shock, a wake-like disturbance in the solar wind caused by its collision with the magnetosphere. The region between the bow shock and magnetopause is called the magnetosheath.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the great}} surprises of the Voyager 2 flyby of Neptune in 1989 was the {{discovery}} of geyser-like eruptions on its moon Triton. Astronomers noticed dark plumes rising to some 8km above the surface, and depositing material up to 150km downwind. These plumes represent invisible jets of gaseous nitrogen, together with dust. All the geysers observed were located close to Triton's <b>subsolar</b> <b>point,</b> indicating that solar heating drives the eruptions. It is thought that the surface of Triton probably consists of a semi-transparent layer of frozen nitrogen overlying a darker substrate, which creates a kind of [...] "solid greenhouse effect", heating and vaporizing nitrogen below the ice surface it until the pressure breaks the surface {{at the start of}} an eruption. Voyagers images of Triton's southern hemisphere show many streaks of dark material laid down by geyser activity.|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} {{that each of}} the three {{quantifiable}} brightening characteristics (i. e., amplitude, time-scale /half-life/, and temporal variability) suggests that brightening of Io may be due to condensation and sublimation of SO 2 frost. This is concentrated within a region that encompasses both the <b>subsolar</b> <b>points</b> at the time of entrance into and emergence from eclipse, and volcanic sources. Qualitatively and intuitively, an SO 2 frost hypothesis is found to provide good possibilities for explaining any variations in Io's ability to brighten, which may occur on a time scale of years...|$|R
50|$|The {{apparent}} motion reverses because approximately four (Earth) {{days prior}} to perihelion, the angular speed of Mercury's orbit exactly equals its rotational velocity, so that the Sun's apparent motion ceases. At perihelion, Mercury's orbital angular velocity slightly exceeds the rotational velocity, so the Sun appears to be retrograde. Four days after perihelion, the Sun's normal apparent motion resumes. Because of its spin-orbit resonance, Mercury presents one of two spots of its surface to the Sun on alternate perihelia. One of these <b>subsolar</b> <b>points</b> is Caloris Planitia ("hot basin"), appropriately named because an observer near its centre would see the Sun loop around the zenith once per Mercurian day, and hence experience a very hot day indeed.|$|R

The primary ozone layer on the night side of the TLE (Fig. 4 c), on the other hand, appears depleted compared to its PDE night-time equivalent (Fig. 4 b).

The day–night side variation of the TLE primary ozone layer is ∼ 40 [...]...|$|R
500|$|While Earth's {{magnetic}} field is roughly teardrop-shaped, Jupiter's is flatter, more closely resembling a disk, and [...] "wobbles" [...] periodically about its axis. The {{main reasons for}} this disk-like configuration are the centrifugal force from the co-rotating plasma and thermal pressure of hot plasma, both of which act to stretch Jupiter's {{magnetic field}} lines, forming a flattened pancake-like structure, known as the magnetodisk, at the distances greater than 20RJ from the planet. The magnetodisk has a thin current sheet at the middle plane, approximately near the magnetic equator. The magnetic field lines point away from Jupiter above the sheet and towards Jupiter below it. The load of plasma from Io greatly expands {{the size of the}} Jovian magnetosphere, because the magnetodisk creates an additional internal pressure which balances the pressure of the solar wind. In the absence of Io the distance from the planet to the magnetopause at the <b>subsolar</b> <b>point</b> would be no more than 42RJ, whereas it is actually 75RJ on average.|$|E
500|$|All the geysers {{observed}} {{were located}} between 50° and 57°S, {{the part of}} Triton's surface close to the <b>subsolar</b> <b>point.</b> This indicates that solar heating, although very weak at Triton's great distance from the Sun, plays a crucial role. It is thought that the surface of Triton probably consists of a translucent layer of frozen nitrogen overlying a darker substrate, which creates a kind of [...] "solid greenhouse effect". Solar radiation passes through the thin surface ice sheet, slowly heating and vaporizing subsurface nitrogen until enough gas pressure accumulates for it to erupt through the crust. A temperature increase of just 4K above the ambient surface temperature of 37K could drive eruptions to the heights observed. Although commonly termed [...] "cryovolcanic", this nitrogen plume activity is distinct from Triton's larger scale cryovolcanic eruptions, as well as volcanic processes on other worlds, which are powered by the internal heat {{of the body in}} question. Analogous CO2 geysers on Mars are thought to erupt from its south polar cap each spring.|$|E
500|$|On a sub-kilometer {{scale the}} surface of Callisto is more {{degraded}} than the surfaces of other icy Galilean moons. Typically there is a deficit of small impact craters with diameters less than 1km as compared with, for instance, the dark plains on Ganymede. Instead of small craters, the almost ubiquitous surface features are small knobs and pits. The knobs are thought to represent remnants of crater rims degraded by an as-yet uncertain process. The most likely candidate process is the slow sublimation of ice, which is enabled by a temperature of up to 165K, reached at a <b>subsolar</b> <b>point.</b> Such sublimation of water or other volatiles from the dirty ice that is the bedrock causes its decomposition. The non-ice remnants form debris avalanches descending from {{the slopes of the}} crater walls. Such avalanches are often observed near and inside impact craters and termed [...] "debris aprons". Sometimes crater walls are cut by sinuous valley-like incisions called [...] "gullies", which resemble certain Martian surface features. In the ice sublimation hypothesis, the low-lying dark material is interpreted as a blanket of primarily non-ice debris, which originated from the degraded rims of craters and has covered a predominantly icy bedrock.|$|E
30|$|The {{susceptibility}} of GNSS receivers to solar radio bursts {{was first}} considered by Klobuchar et al. (1999). They {{suggested that a}} solar radio burst with power of 20, 000 solar flux units (SFU, with 1 SFU =  10 − 22 W/m 2 /Hz; all Right Hand Circularly Polarised, RHCP) or 40, 000 SFU (half RHCP) can produce 3  dB reduction in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), whereas a power of 180, 000 SFU (all RHCP) or 360, 000 SFU (half RHCP) can cause 10  dB reduction. During the large solar radio burst that accompanied the X 5 (5.0  ×  10 − 4  W/m 2) solar flare on 28 October 2003, Chen et al. (2005) demonstrated that almost no GPS L 2 signals were tracked by the International GNSS Service (IGS) receivers during the solar flux peak time for areas near the <b>subsolar</b> <b>points.</b> Their study revealed a high correlation between the rate of loss of lock on the GPS L 2 frequency and the solar radio flux density at 1.415  GHz, suggesting that the GPS signal losses of lock were primarily caused by microwave in-band interference. The measured solar radio burst power for this event was 4000 – 12, 000 SFU, {{much lower than the}} level (40, 000 SFU) expected to have significant effect on GPS receivers. These results suggested that the effect of solar radio bursts on GPS technology is much more complex than indicated by the analysis of Klobuchar et al. (1999).|$|R
5|$|As with Earth's magnetosphere, the {{boundary}} separating the denser and colder solar wind's plasma from the hotter and less dense one within Jupiter's magnetosphere {{is called the}} magnetopause. The distance from the magnetopause {{to the center of}} the planet is from 45 to 100 RJ (where RJ=71,492km is the radius of Jupiter) at the <b>subsolar</b> point—the unfixed <b>point</b> on the surface at which the Sun would appear directly overhead to an observer. The position of the magnetopause depends on the pressure exerted by the solar wind, which in turn depends on solar activity. In front of the magnetopause (at a distance from 80 to 130RJ from the planet's center) lies the bow shock, a wake-like disturbance in the solar wind caused by its collision with the magnetosphere. The region between the bow shock and magnetopause is called the magnetosheath.|$|R
40|$|Thermospheric waves {{occurring}} {{around the}} time of the 14 July 2000 solar flare were investigated using the Global Ionosphere and Thermosphere Model. The simulation results showed that extensive acoustic and gravity waves were excited by the solar flare in the subsolar region. The subsolar buoyancy period at 400 km altitude was approximately 16 min. Gravity waves with frequencies lower than the buoyancy frequency traveled from the dayside to the nightside and converged in the longitudinal region that was the antisubsolar region when the flare occurred. Acoustic waves with frequencies well above the buoyancy frequency propagated upward from approximately 130 km altitude with increasing amplitudes. The power spectra of the vertical neutral winds in the acoustic branch peaked at a period of approximately 13 min, just below the buoyancy period. The gradient in pressure was the driver of the two waves, while the ion drag caused a phase delay between the variations in the pressure gradient and the vertical velocity in the acoustic waves. An anticorrelation in the high‐frequency component of the vertical neutral wind exists between the <b>subsolar</b> and antisubsolar <b>points</b> at times away from the flare, which was driven by the rapid variations of the ion flows due to the penetration electric field. It is suggested that the penetration of the high‐latitude interplanetary magnetic field electric field to low latitudes can drive neutral waves in the equatorial region through momentum coupling with rapidly changing ion flows.

Our measurements sound a broad region of the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere of Venus ranging from 10 − 2 – 10 − 5 mb (which in the Venus International Reference Atmosphere, VIRA, is approximately 100 – 150 km during the daytime) and show a maximum around 195 ± 10 K in the subsolar region, decreasing with latitude and local time towards the terminator. This is in qualitative agreement with predictions by a Venus Thermospheric General Circulation Model (VTGCM) after a proper averaging of altitudes for meaningful comparisons, although our temperatures are colder than the model by about 25 K throughout.
