40|$|Predicting the {{occurrence}} of economically important demersal fish in a multispecies marine environment can be of considerable value to fisheries management and protection of biodiversity. Here, 2 predictive modelling principles were utilised, artificial neural network (ANN) and discriminant function analysis (DFA), to develop presence/absence models for 3 <b>species</b> (<b>anglerfish</b> Lophius budegassa; hake Merluccius merluccius; red mullet Mullus barbatus) in the Mediterranean Sea. ANN-based models of demersal fish distribution outperformed conventional models and attained better recognition and prediction performance. Results indicated the ability of ANN's to predict presence more accurately than DFA when tested against independent field data. More precisely, sensitivity values obtained using DFA were 62. 1 % for anglerfish, 5. 8 % for hake and 59. 8 % for red mullet whereas using ANN were 75, 71 and 72. 9 % respectively. The accuracy of test data was 79. 6 % for anglerfish, 49. 5 % for hake and 83. 3 % for red mullet using DFA and 83. 7, 83. 3 and 85. 6 % respectively using a back-propagation ANN. After learning from a set of selected patterns, the neural network (NN) models displayed a relatively high demersal fish classification accuracy, which was consistent with present understanding of the aggregating effects of the examined variables on these species' distribution. Predicting presence or absence {{was found to be}} easier for red mullet and anglerfish than for hake. The present results also suggested that the main processes modulating {{the occurrence}} of anglerfish, hake and red mullet in the NE Mediterranean Sea can be approximated by linear functions only to a limited extent. Due to their ability to mimic non-linear systems, ANNs proved far more effective in modelling the distribution of these species in the marine ecosystem. The main results and the ANN potential to predict suitable habitat profiles and structural characteristics of species assemblages are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Anglerfish Lophius piscatorius has {{during the}} last two decades become a highly {{exploited}} resource and {{is now one of the}} five most economically important demersal fish species in the Faroese fishery. Despite this, there is at present little information available on the population status of anglerfish in Faroese waters. The main aim of this study is to increase the biological knowledge of anglerfish and to perform an assessment of the stock in order to evaluate the sustainability of the anglerfish fishery and to investigate trophic interactions between anglerfish and other commercially important demersal fish <b>species.</b> <b>Anglerfish</b> illicia, the first fin ray, were used for age reading. The age determinations were validated and concluded to be useful in an age-based assessment because the growth rates were consistent with length frequency and mark-recapture analyses. Anglerfish have a very high growth rate during their first year of life, compared with the older ages. Males mature at a lower length and younger age than females. The L 50 for males and females was 58 cm and 84 cm, respectively, corresponding to an age of around four years for males and seven years for females. Observations of spawning males and females, egg-ribbons and pelagic anglerfish larvae revealed that anglerfish have a prolonged spawning season, which peaks from February to April. In addition, observations showed that there are at least two local spawning areas, one southwest of the Faroe Plateau and one in the Faroe Bank area. Large anglerfish tagged with data storage tags and conventional tags showed a seasonal offshore-onshore migration. They migrated to shallow depths in summer to feed and to deeper waters in winter, presumably to spawn. Anglerfish performed vertical movements up into the water column, and were most active in these vertical movements during the winter time and during the nights, and light intensity seemed to trigger the migrations. Anglerfish distribution was temperature dependent, since anglerfish generally preferred temperatures warmer than 4 ºC, usually between 6. 5 – 11 ºC. This may explain why anglerfish were distributed deeper west of the Faroe Bank area compared to the Faroe Plateau, which is surrounded by cold water deeper than approximately 500 m. Anglerfish in Faroese waters preyed on a variety of food items. They were generally eating fish and the most important prey species in terms of numbers were Norway pout and blue whiting, whereas cod and haddock contributed most in weight. Annual consumption by anglerfish on commercially important demersal species, such as cod, haddock and saithe, was estimated to correspond to 33, 19 and 2 % of the landings and to 75, 20 and 2 % of biomass losses due to natural mortality, respectively. Even with this high cod consumption by anglerfish, cod cannibalism and fishing mortality still have greater impact on the cod stock dynamics than predation by anglerfish. The annual biomass loss of anglerfish due to cannibalism was estimated to nearly 15 % of the annual loss due to natural mortality. Anglerfish in Faroese waters may be regarded as a separate stock because all life stages are found in the area, local spawning area, seasonal offshore-onshore migration on the Faroe Plateau, together with insignificant emigration/immigration (< 5 %). An age-based stock assessment of anglerfish in Faroese waters for the period 1999 – 2011 showed that the stock biomass ranged between 9000 and 19000 t with a peak in 2004 – 2005 and the fishing mortality for age 3 – 8 varied between 0. 2 and 0. 5 year- 1. The yield per recruit curve indicated that the stock was slightly growth overfished. Decreasing the fishing mortality could potentially increase the yield per recruit by around 10 % leading to a 50 % higher equilibrium biomass of anglerfish. No clear stock-recruitment relationship was found. On the other hand, anglerfish year-class strength was correlated with environmental variables, such as sandeel abundance. Hence, the rather short time series of anglerfish year-class strength provides little or no evidence of recruitment overfishing. It is recommended that stock assessments should be performed on an annual basis, allowing managers to react timely when there are signs of overfishing or recruitment failure due to natural or fishery causes...|$|E

One theory suggests the males attach to females regardless of their own reproductive development if the female is not sexually mature, but when both male and female are mature, they spawn then separate.|$|R
25|$|In many animals, {{males are}} {{much smaller than}} females. In some <b>species</b> of <b>anglerfish,</b> such as Ceratias holboelli, the males are so small they have become sexual parasites, wholly {{dependent}} on females of their own species for survival, and unable to fend for themselves.

50|$|Some <b>species</b> of <b>anglerfish</b> also display extreme sexual dimorphism. Females {{are more}} typical in {{appearance}} to other fish, whereas the males are tiny rudimentary creatures with stunted digestive systems.

40|$|The {{study of}} the feeding ecology of marine organisms is crucial to {{understanding}} their ecological roles and advancing our knowledge of marine ecosystem functioning. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse the trophic ecology of two demersal predator <b>species,</b> black <b>anglerfish</b> (Lophius budegassa) and white anglerfish (L. piscatorius), in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Both species are important in the study area due to their high abundance and economic value, but information about their feeding behaviour is scarce. Here, we described the diet composition and ecological role of these two species, investigating whether trophic segregation exists between them and amongst fish of different sizes. In addition, by using experimental survey data we described the spatial distribution of both species to help us interpret trophic behaviour patterns. We gathered samples of two different sizes (small individuals of a total length = 30 cm) of both species and combined stomach content analyses (SCA) and stable isotope analyses (SIA) of nitrogen and carbon with isotopic mixing models. Our results revealed that both <b>anglerfish</b> <b>species</b> are opportunistic predators, showing a diet composed mainly of fishes and, to a lesser extent, of crustaceans, with a small proportion of cephalopods, gastropods, bivalves and echinoderms. We found trophic segregation between the two species and the two sizes, indicating that they feed on different prey, in line with differences in their spatial distribution within the study area. This partial partition of food resources could also be explained by the differences in rhythms of activity that were reported in previous studies. In addition, although both species occupied a high position within the food web, our results showed that white anglerfish individuals and the large-sized fish of both species held higher trophic positions. This study demonstrates the usefulness of complementary approaches for trophic studies and confirms that both <b>anglerfish</b> <b>species</b> play an important role as predators in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea food web...|$|R

25|$|In some <b>species</b> of <b>anglerfish,</b> when a male finds a female, he bites {{into her}} skin, and {{releases}} an enzyme that digests {{the skin of}} his mouth and her body, fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level. The male becomes dependent on the female host for survival by receiving nutrients via their shared circulatory system, and provides sperm to the female in return. After fusing, males increase in volume and become much larger relative to free-living males of the species. They live and remain reproductively functional as long as the female lives, and can take part in multiple spawnings. This extreme sexual dimorphism ensures, when the female is ready to spawn, she has a mate immediately available. Multiple males can be incorporated into a single individual female with up to eight males in some species, though some taxa appear to have a one male per female rule.|$|R
2500|$|The name [...] "anglerfish" [...] {{derives from}} the species' {{characteristic}} method of predation. Anglerfish typically {{have at least one}} long filament sprouting from the middle of their heads, termed the illicium. The illicium is the detached and modified first three spines of the anterior dorsal fin. In most <b>anglerfish</b> <b>species,</b> the longest filament is the first. This first spine protrudes above the fish's eyes and terminates in an irregular growth of flesh (the esca), and can move in all directions. Anglerfish can wiggle the esca to make it resemble a prey animal, which lures the anglerfish's prey close enough for the anglerfish to devour them whole.|$|R
50|$|Pietsch {{has named}} 65 species and 12 genera of fishes, {{most of them}} lophiiform taxa, both living and extinct, {{including}} the recently described Psychedelic Frogfish, Histiophryne psychedelica. He is recognized as {{an expert on the}} evolution, ecology, and behavior of both shallow-water anglerfishes (e.g., frogfishes) and deep-sea anglerfishes of the suborder Ceratioidei. Perhaps his most intriguing work has focused on the evolution of sexual parasitism in deep-sea anglerfishes, a reproductive strategy in which a tiny dwarf male attaches and fuses to a much larger female. With his studies of the evolutionary relationships of <b>anglerfish</b> <b>species,</b> Pietsch has determined that this reproductive mode may have evolved as many as five times within deep-sea anglerfishes.|$|R
50|$|Species of Lophius {{have three}} long {{filaments}} sprouting {{from the middle}} of their heads; these are the detached and modified three first spines of the anterior dorsal fin.

Whether the prey has been attracted to the lure or not is not strictly relevant, as the action of the jaws is an automatic reflex triggered by contact with the esca.|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to a request from the Department of Communications Marine and Natural Resources and fishing industry, the conversion factors used to estimate round or live weights from gutted anglerfish were re-examined. A number of data sources was available from survey data, port sampling and observer trips. In some cases, the liver is left in place when the fish are gutted. For these landings a separate conversion factor is necessary. The conversion factors {{were found to be}} independent of fish size, however, some significant differences between the data sources were found. Significant differences between the conversion factors of the two <b>species</b> of <b>anglerfish</b> (Lophius piscatorius and L. budegassa) were also found. As commercial landings of anglerfish are not usually speciated, a generic conversion factor was estimated for Lophius spp. by combining the data for both species after weighting by the estimated proportions of the two species in the Irish landings. The resultant conversion factor for fully gutted fish is 1. 23 and 1. 17 when the liver is left in place; both estimates are lower than the current Irish factor of 1. 28.

50|$|The black (L. budegassa) {{and white}} (L. piscatorius) {{anglerfish}} both live in shallow, inshore waters from 800 m to deeper waters (greater than 1000 m).These two species {{are very similar}} to one another with only a few distinctions between them. These include; the colour of the peritoneum (black for L. budegassa and white for L. piscatorius) and the number of rays in the second dorsal fin (L. budegassa, 9-10 and L. piscatorius, 11-12). Also, minor differences in their distribution occur. Black anglerfish tend to have a more southern distribution (Mediterranean and eastern North Atlantic from the British Isles to Senegal) whereas the white anglerfish are distributed further north, (Mediterranean, Black Sea and eastern North Atlantic from Barents Sea to the Straits of Gibraltar). Despite these differences, the overall distribution of the black and white anglerfish tend to overlap greatly. A map of the distribution of anglerfish in the waters surrounding Europe and North Africa {{can be found in the}} external links section. The movements of both <b>species</b> of <b>anglerfish</b> indicate a mixing of both northern and southern species could have strong implications for the geographical boundaries of the stocks from a management perspective. Both species of Lophius are important because they are commercially valuable species usually caught by trawl and gillnetting fleets.|$|R
25|$|It is {{not easy}} finding a mate in this zone. Some species depend on bioluminescence.

After a genus-specific PCR, a fast digestion with the restriction enzyme BfaI, followed by agarose gel electrophoresis, allowed a clear species identification by producing specific restriction patterns.

40|$|Abstract. The <b>anglerfish</b> <b>species</b> Lophius piscatorius and Lophius budegassa {{are among}} the most {{valuable}} fishes sought after by bottom fisheries in western and southern European waters. It is currently believed that there are two stocks for each of the two species, north and south, which determine their assessment and management. A genetic analysis using eight polymorphic microsatellite markers was carried out on samples collected from western European waters and the south-western Mediterranean Sea. The results strongly suggest that the boundary between northern and southern stocks is not genetically supported. However, populations were not genetically homogeneous. Besides a pattern of genetic differentiation between Mediterranean {{and the rest of the}} samples, the L. budegassa samples taken from the Spain Atlantic zone and from the Portugal Atlantic zone were genetically distinct, whereas the samples taken in the French Atlantic zone for the L. piscatorius species seem to be different from the rest of the samples under study. This can be indicative of a more subtle genetic structure that deserves more study for guaranteeing adequate fishery management of these species...|$|R
