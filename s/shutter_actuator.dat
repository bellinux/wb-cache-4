5000|$|The {{army general}} staff was {{amazed by the}} flight {{characteristics}} of the plane, which surpassed the Hiens in all but maximum speed (degraded by a maximum of 29 km/h mph by the larger area of the radial engine's front cowling), and the model was ordered {{to be put in}} production as the Goshikisen (Go = five; shiki = type; sentoki = fighter) or Army Fighter Type 5. The company's name was Ki-100-1-Ko. All of the airframes were remanufactured from Ki-61-II Kai and Ki-61-III airframes; the integral engine mount/cowling side panel was cut off the fuselage and a tubular steel engine mount was bolted to the firewall/bulkhead. Many of the redundant fittings from the liquid-cooled engine, such as the ventral radiator <b>shutter</b> <b>actuator,</b> were still kept. The first 271 aircraft, or Ki-100-1-Ko, with the raised [...] "razorback" [...] rear fuselage were rolled out of the factory between March and June 1945. A further 118 Ki-100 I-Otsu were built with a cut-down rear fuselage and new rear-view canopy from May through to the end of July 1945. This version also featured a modified oil cooler under the engine in a more streamlined fairing.|$|E

This file specifies that the room {{is equipped with a}} TelosB indoor presence sensor with an id equal to pr 1, a RFXCOM outdoor luminosity sensor, an EnOcean lamp actuator and a KNX <b>shutter</b> <b>actuator.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{development}} of a large diameter high pressure quick acting propulsion valve and valve actuator is described. The valve {{is the heart of}} a major test facility dedicated to conducting full scale performance tests of aircraft landing systems. The valve opens in less than 300 milliseconds releasing a 46 -centimeter- (18 -in. -) diameter water jet and closes in 300 milliseconds. The four main components of the valve, i. e., valve body, safety shutter, high speed <b>shutter,</b> and pneumatic-hydraulic <b>actuator,</b> are discussed. This valve is unique and may have other aerospace and industrial applications...|$|R
40|$|Space-flight {{hardware}} {{is required}} to meet specific outgassing criteria under vacuum conditions {{in order to reduce}} the risk of contaminating sensitive optics and spacecraft components. Under certain circumstances, it is desirable to measure the contamination levels that are being released from all surfaces of the test payload. This certification is often accomplished with a Total Outgassing Measurement (TOM) box. The TOM box has one 103. 2 square centimeter (16 square inch) opening and one 4. 84 square centimeter (0. 75 square inches) opening. The larger opening allows contaminants to easily escape the box during the hardware bakeout phase. The smaller opening provides a limited conductance path for outgassed contaminants during the certification phase. A Thermoelectric Quartz Crystal Microbalance (TQCM) monitors the contamination levels inside the box to provide the total outgassing measurement. During transition from the bakeout phase to the certification phase, the TOM box is reconfigured to close the larger opening. For previous certifications, the vacuum chamber was returned to ambient conditions and the larger conductance port was closed manually. The ROS system eliminates the need to enter the chamber by remotely closing the large TOM box opening. Substantial schedule and cost savings are achieved through the use of this system. The ROS system consists of three main components; a <b>shutter,</b> a motion <b>actuator,</b> and an actuator controller. Each of these components was selected or designed to operate in an extreme-temperature and vacuum environment while providing a high level of reliability. Different types of motion actuators were considered for driving the shutter. Design parameters for the actuator included material properties, force capability, reliability, and cost...|$|R
30|$|During these {{measurements}} {{was established}} the optimal distance 20  m for switch actuator and dimming actuator and 10  m for <b>shutter</b> <b>actuator</b> (Table  1). The parameterization interface experiences serious problems {{trying to find}} active components in distances over 20 meters. This also limits the measurement of the signal quality.|$|E
30|$|In our {{simulated}} environment the first wall was placed {{directly behind the}} USB communication interface and the second wall was placed two meters from the first one. During these measurements was established the optimal distance 20  m for switch actuator and dimming actuator and 10  m for <b>shutter</b> <b>actuator</b> (Table  3). The parameterization interface experiences serious problems trying to find active components in distances over 20 meters. This also limits the measurement of the signal quality.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a new type}} of micromachined electric field mill (MEFM) for measuring dc electric fields. This MEFM employs thermal actuators for vertical movement of an electrically grounded shutter, to mill the amplitude of a dc electric field incident on underlying sense electrodes. It addresses the main drawbacks of existing MEFMs, which are shutter displacement in large electric field, and drive signal interference from the <b>shutter</b> <b>actuator.</b> Simulation results show that for a 1 kV/m dc field the output of the sensor is about 1 pA...|$|E
30|$|The first {{transaction}} verifies if {{the sensors}} data {{did not change}} (lines 8, 9). Then, it sends the computed shutter command to a <b>shutter</b> <b>actuator.</b> This is done by applying a put on the Actuators bag of a PUTUTU object. This transaction also sends the computed lamp command to a lamp actuator (line 11) and updates the knowledge (line 12). If a command cannot be sent due to a problem on the shutter (resp. the lamp) actuator, the put at line 10 (resp. line 11) fails and the knowledge is not updated. This prevents from inconsistencies. To signal the shutter or the lamp problem, the second transaction, sends a SMS to the maintenance team.|$|E
