40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we would like}} to draw {{attention}} on the fact how important for the absorption of the EU funds might be each country's or region's split of its financial portfolio between EU, national and private <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>co-financing.</b> Based on data from the Ex-Post Evaluation 1994 - 99, this paper provides information on financial absorption in the Objective 1 areas of Member States in the 1994 - 1999 period. We were interested in which financial components are "more easily" absorbed and, consequently, what lessons regarding the potential "allocation trap" for the New Member States could be drawn here? We also compared our results with the situation in the programming documents of Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Estonia and Slovenia made respective conclusions...|$|E

The respondents declared that they visit forests {{throughout the year}} for various purposes, most often with family or friends and most frequently for the recreational activity of walking. They typically spend about three hours in the forest during a single visit. Respondents perceived the most important functions of the forest {{as a place where}} plants and animals live, as well as a place for recreation. In their view, the state budget should be a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>co-financing</b> the recreational management of the forest. On 1 y a small number of respondents (27. 5 %) would be willing to allocate a portion of their income for recreational forest management. According to the respondents, the most important elements needed in the forest to improve its quality for tourism are information signs and litter bins. Respondents perceive the greatest threats to the forest from tourism to be vandalism, automobiles driving into the forest and wildlife disturbance, whereas the greatest threats to tourists were reported to be biting and stinging animals (snakes, ticks and mosquitoes) and the possibility of getting lost. Respondents indicated clean air, peace and quiet, as well as the ability to harvest wild fruits, plants and mushrooms as the greatest advantages of using the forest for recreation. A large proportion of respondents admitted {{that they would like to}} use the services of professional foresters, especially for nature walks and health related purposes, as well as to educate children and youth about nature and the forest...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to analyse some results of {{cost-benefit}} analysis {{in a sample of}} ISPA (Structural Instrument for pre-accession countries) projects. The focus is particularly on the variability of financial and economic rates of return and how to integrate this information in the EU co- financing mechanism. We investigate, through the analysis <b>of</b> variance <b>of</b> <b>co-financing</b> rate, to which extent variability of rates is due to structural characteristics (sectors, countries) or to the existence of a residual variance due both to specificity of the project and discretional element of the appraisal method, which may constitute an information noise. We find that the variance <b>of</b> <b>co-financing</b> rate across countries is poorly explained by different composition of sectors of investment. This suggests the need to reinforce a more consistent approach to evaluation and co-financing. We suggest some possible solutions.

The theory section {{show that there}} is currently no statutory regulation <b>of</b> private <b>co-financing.</b> However a regulation is proposed in a supplement to existing planning and building law (2010 : 900). The case studies present examples <b>of</b> how private <b>co-financing</b> <b>of</b> national roads works in practice. In these cases, private co-financing is regulated by the development agreement. The analysis points out that problems can arise when the parties in a development agreement are not equal. I denna uppsats presenteras fenomenet privat medfinansiering av statliga vägar. I teoriavsnittet visas att det idag inte finns någon lagreglering av privat medfinansiering. En reglering föreslås dock i ett tillägg till gällande plan- och bygglag (2010 : 900). I fallstudier presenteras exempel på hur privat medfinansiering av statliga vägar går till i praktiken. Där framkommer att privat medfinansiering regleras i exploateringsavtal. Analysen visar bland annat på att vissa problem kan uppstå då parter i ett exploateringsavtal inte är jämbördiga...|$|R

However, such a cooperation can be effective only on condition {{that there is a}} sufficient normative and organizational base at national and international levels. The law On cross border cooperation is analyzed. All drawbacks and positives of the document are pointed out. Propositions for the improvement of legal regulation of cross  border cooperation are presented. Changes, that should be moved to the law, are introduced, concerning: special customs and tax privileges, participation of regional authorities in border cooperation, new mechanisms of cooperation in the framework of new aid programs. Special attention is focused on establishing of a special fund on the state level, that can support the programs and projects of border cooperation and form the <b>source</b> for <b>co-financing</b> <b>of</b> those EU projects. Conceptual approaches to the improvement of organizational and legal mechanisms of economic cross border cooperation are determined. The definition of organizational and legal mechanism of development of economic cross border cooperation is proposed.

40|$|Subsidized {{microfinance}} institutions (MFIs) provide affordable {{credit to}} small entrepreneurs. Many industrialized countries regulate MFIs. But {{in a market}} with accessible small business financing, regulatory loan ceilings can jeopardize the supply of microcredit to the most disadvantaged people. This is because small entrepreneurs in need of above-ceiling credit {{have the option to}} combine a ceiling-high microcredit with a supplementary loan from a regular bank. By reducing information asymmetry, this type <b>of</b> <b>co-financing</b> may prompt MFIs to divert credit away from entrepreneurs seeking below-ceiling loans.
