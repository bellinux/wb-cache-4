Some of the centers of textile industry include Zlatograd, Smolyan, Madan, Laki. Timber industry is developed mainly in the western parts where there are some of the most important forest massifs in the Balkan Peninsula.

Pamporovo and Chepelare are major winter resorts and during summer there is a number of resorts, camp sites and refuges on the shores of the dams or in the green valleys. The caves along the Greek border such as Yagodinska, Uhlovitsa, Devil's Throat Cave, Snezhanka (near Peshtera) and others are popular among speleologists with their spectacular forms and underground lakes and rivers.

ELM-free H-mode {{is characterized by}} the absence of any kind of edge pedestal relaxation mechanisms and, therefore, by an enhanced impurity confinement. Both plasma density and radiated power rise rapidly during an ELM-free H-mode and it terminates in radiative collapse. In contrast, EDA H-mode usually exists {{for as long as the}} auxiliary heating is applied. It is a steady state regime with constant line average density and radiated power, no <b>significant</b> <b>impurity</b> accumulation throughout the discharge, and energy confinement comparable to that of ELM-free H-mode. It was shown previously [1] that in EDA H-mode the enhanced impurity transport across the edge barrier is provided by a quasicoherent electromagnetic mode (QC mode) localized at the pedestal region. The QC mode is clearly seen in EDA as a narrow band (∆f ~ 10 kHz) density fluctuations at ~ 100 kHz. In contrast, ELM-free H-mode is characterized by decreasing level of fluctuation relative to L-mode. It was shown in [1] that the transition to EDA regime occurs at q 95 (q at 95 % flux surface) of about 3. 5 and higher. At lower values of q 95 only ELM-free regime can be obtained.

In general we find good agreement for the composition of liquid and solid phases between our MD simulations and the semi analytic model of Medin and Cumming. The trace presence of a third component, neon, does not appear to strongly impact the chemical separation found previously for two component carbon and oxygen systems. This suggests that small amounts of 22 Ne may not qualitatively change how the material in white dwarf stars freezes. However, we do find systematically lower melting temperatures (higher Gamma) in our MD simulations compared to the semi analytic model.

40|$|Evidence from {{research}} papers supporting {{the hypothesis that}} the exothermic nuclear reactions providing the observed episodes of excess heat in deuterated palladium (Pd) and titanium (Ti) are Oppenheimer-Phillips (OP) reactions between deuterons and nuclei of the host metal, Pd or Ti and their <b>significant</b> <b>impurities.</b> Details of the supporting evidence hinge upon neutron activation analysis (NAA) of metal samples before and after production of excess heat episodes plus observation of gamma ray emissions from plausible products of the OP reactions. One example of an OP reaction in palladium is Pd 108 + d →Pd 109 + p, where d and p represent the deuteron and proton respectively. Thus the neutron half of the deuteron has been “stripped away” from its associated proton, leading to the reaction being named the “deuteron stripping” reaction. The strength of the evidence cited in this paper is surprising in light of the high atomic number on the metal atom side of the reaction equation, 46 for Pd and 22 for Ti.

Many fuels suitable for SOFCs derive from hydrocarbon sources, such as natural gas or biogas; however, these contain <b>significant</b> <b>impurities,</b> most notably compounds containing sulphur, which can poison the nickel electrocatalyst in the anode of the fuel cell. Sulphur removal is usually carried out but it is complicated and expensive to achieve levels below 1 part per million (ppm). An enhanced scientific understanding of chemical interactions {{on the surface of}} SOFC electrodes is critical to the development of robust nickel-based anodes, but the mechanisms and effects of sulphur poisoning are not fully understood. The scope of this thesis is to advance the field of sulphur-poisoning research by studying the effect of current density on the sulphur-induced degradation, and focuses on intermediate-temperature (IT) conditions with nickel-gadolinia doped ceria (Ni-CGO), which is the most promising anode material for IT-SOFCs, operating between 600 – 800 °C. The work of this thesis is aimed at (i) investigating the kinetics of sulphur poisoning, and the effect of current density, by use of a specially built three-electrode electrochemical test rig; (ii) analysis of structural modifications to the anode microstructure as a result of exposure to fuel cell conditions and (iii) development and prototype testing of a miniature SOFC test rig with optical access for in situ Raman spectroscopy. Fuel cell operation at higher current density was found to partially mitigate the sulphur poisoning of up to 3 ppm H 2 S in H 2 fuel, while microstructural analysis found that the presence of as little as 0. 5 ppm H 2 S accelerated restructuring of nickel grain surfaces.

The salt layers often contain <b>significant</b> <b>impurities.</b> GRI and DOE have initialized this research proposal {{in order to increase}} the gas storage capabilities by providing operators with improved geotechnical design and operating guidelines for thin bedded salt caverns. Terralog has summarized the geologic conditions, pressure conditions, and critical design factors that may lead to: (1) Fracture in heterogeneous materials; (2) Differential deformation and bedding plane slip; (3) Propagation of damage around single and multiple cavern; and (4) Improved design recommendations for single and multiple cavern configurations in various bedded salt environments. The existing caverns within both the Permian Basin Complex and the Michigan and Appalachian Basins are normally found between 300 m to 1, 000 m (1, 000 ft to 3, 300 ft) depth depending on local geology and salt dissolution depth. Currently, active cavern operations are found in the Midland and Anadarko Basins within the Permian Basin Complex and in the Appalachian and Michigan Basins. The Palo Duro and Delaware Basins within the Permian Basin Complex also offer salt cavern development potential. Terralog developed a number of numerical models for caverns located in thin bedded salt. A modified creep viscoplastic model has been developed and implemented in Flac 3 D to simulate the response of salt at the Permian, Michigan and Appalachian Basins. The formulation of the viscoplastic salt model, which is based on an empirical creep law developed for Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) Program, is combined with the Drucker-Prager model to include the formation of damage and failure. The Permian salt lab test data provided by Pfeifle et al. 1983, are used to validate the assumptions made in the material model development. For the actual cavern simulations two baseline models are developed for single and multiple caverns, respectively. Different parameters that affect damage propagation and deformation of salt cavern, such as cavern pressure, operating conditions, cavern height/diameter ratio, overburden stiffness and roof thickness are analyzed and the respective results summarized. For multiple horizontal caverns numerical models are developed to determine the cavern interaction and the minimum safe center to center distance.

40|$|Abstract: The {{anticipated}} {{regime of}} ITER is the H-mode {{in which the}} ELMs can significantly deteriorate the operation. The lost plasma is dumped into the SOL and then impacts on the target producing sputtering and vaporization erosion. The following contamination of core plasma by eroded atoms can interrupt the confinement. For tokamak modelling with account for the transients, the tokamak geometry MHD codes FOREV and TOKES have been developed. The FOREV models the processes on the time scale of 1 ms with the CFC wall. The modelling for ITER plasma evolution following the carbon influxes revealed that <b>significant</b> <b>impurity</b> contamination of the edge plasma can occur, which can cause large radiation losses and eventually lead {{to the collapse of}} the confinement at lesser ELM sizes than that determined by armour lifetime limitations. The TOKES is developed for the integrated simulation on the discharge scale (10 3 s), however permitting multiple ELMs. Multi-fluid plasma and corona radiation transport are implemented. In the modelling for ITER with B-C-W wall, the scattered atoms have significant chances to strike secondarily the dome and thus produce sputtered W-atoms even with the CFC wall at the separatrix strike point. The ELMs cause untimely discharge interruption if the ELM energy exceeds the vaporization onset. To validate the codes, dedicated experiments have been carried out. CFC targets manufactured for ITER have been exposed at the plasma gun MK- 200 UG in TRINITI. On the basis of these experiments, significant plasma contamination is expected for ITER transients at the target heat deposition above 0. 5 MJ/m 2, which corresponds to the vapour shield threshold and agrees with the FOREV and TOKES simulations. 1...|$|R

The case presented in this analysis focuses on the chiral pyrethroid transfluthrin (TFL) synthesized by esterification of an acid chloride and alcoholic moiety. According to any modifications of the process of synthesis and purification, new potentially highly toxic and yet chemically reactive impurities in low concentrations (< 0. 1 %) may be formed. Amongst these, that with the structural alert ‘organic acid anhydride’ was given heightened concern as the most potent putative toxicologically <b>significant</b> <b>impurity.</b> The course taken in this analysis focused on the comparison of reference TFL with commercialized generic TFL from two alternative manufacturing sources in India and China. Despite their apparent high racemic purity, TFLs from generic sources were biologically less effective, genotoxic in the Ames’ assay, demonstrated sensory lung irritation and lung/skin sensitization in specialized bioassays. While the off-patent reference TFL was unequivocally negative in all assays (anhydride content not detectable, LOQ < 0. 01 %), positive results with high batch-to-batch variability were a frequent outcome in generic TFLs. Tier I analytical assays failed to detect this relevant impurity in the absence of impurity-specific optimized analytical procedures. This finding suggests that a well-balanced combined approach of analytical and toxicological assays provides the best means to assure that all critical impurities are identified and accounted for. Similarly, putative ‘structural alert’-based toxicity tests proved to be more predictive than any indiscriminant battery of standard bioassays commonly applied to demonstrate equivalence, such as acute oral/dermal toxicity and/or eye/skin irritation assays...|$|R
40|$|Recycling of {{secondary}} raw materials by non-ferrous metal producers is steadily increasing. These materials inevitably introduce various impurities {{to the production}} furnaces, which can change the chemical composition, and thereafter, the {{physical and chemical properties}} of the products and by-products. Alumina {{is one of the most}} common and <b>significant</b> <b>impurities</b> that enters the furnaces in different ways. Finding a balance between the recycling advantages and possible adverse effects of the increased alumina content in the process is of great interest to the metals industry. In the current work, effects of alumina on two of important properties (melting and leaching behaviours) of an actual industrial fayalite slag, from a Swedish copper producer, is investigated. A reference slag sample, devoid of alumina addition, and three different mixtures of slag with 5, 10, and 15 wt-% alumina addition were prepared. After homogenization (re-melting) of the mixtures, in an induction furnace, the materials were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). A standard single stage leaching test was used to study the leaching behaviour of the samples. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Pt-Rh pans, was applied to investigate the melting and solidification properties of the mixtures. Results show that, olivine, spinel, and augite based solid solutions are the three main constituents of the samples. Addition of alumina to the slag increases the amount of spinel solid solution and changes its composition from iron rich to aluminum rich. The slag shows an alumina saturation limit between 5 and 10 wt-% alumina additions. Chemical composition of the major phases does not change above the saturation and excess amount of aluminum is consumed for formation of a new aluminum containing phase, anorthite. Below the saturation limit, alumina addition causes a relatively sharp increase in the melting temperature of the slag, and at the same time, an increase in the leached amounts of the elements is seen. Alumina addition, close to the saturation limit of the slag, lowers the leachability considerably, while the melting characteristics are not changed dramatically. However, above the saturation limit, a more complex transition occurs as the partial melting and leached amounts of most of the elements increase. In order to achieve an appropriate melting and leaching characteristics, the total alumina content of the slag must be close to its saturation limit. The grounds and influential parameters on such behaviours are thoroughly discussed.

40|$|These ions {{are either}} <b>significant</b> <b>impurities</b> in the {{concentrated}} alkaline aluminate solutions {{used in the}} Bayer process for the purification of alumina, or are useful models for degraded organic matter in industrial Bayer liquors. Such impurities {{are known to have}} important effects on the operation of the Bayer process. To develop {{a better understanding of the}} speciation of oxalate (the major organic impurity in Bayer liquors) in concentrated electrolyte solutions, the formation constant (Log Beta) of the extremely weak ion pair formed between sodium (Na+) and oxalate (Ox 2 -) ions was determined at 25 degrees C as a function if ionic strength in TMACl media by titration using a Na+ ion selective electrode. Attempts to measure this constant in CsCl media were unsuccessful probably because of competition for Ox 2 by Cs+. Aqueous solutions of sodium malonate (Na 2 Mal) and sodium succinate (Na 2 Suc) were studied up to high (saturation) concentrations at 25 degrees C by dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS) over the approximate frequency range 0. 1 less-equal v/GHz less-equal 89. To complement a previous study of Na 2 Ox, formation constants of the Na+-dicarboxylate ion pairs were determined and they were shown to be of the solvent-shared type. Both the Mal 2 - and Suc 2 - ions, in contrast to Ox 2 -, were also shown to possess large secondary hydration shells. Apparent molal volumes (V[phi]) and heat capacities at constant pressure (Cp[phi]) of aqueous solutions of Na 2 Ox, Na 2 Suc, Na 2 Mal and K 2 Ox were determined at 25 degrees C up to their saturation limits using vibrating tube densitometry and flow calorimetry. These data were fitted using a Pitzer model. The adherence of V[phi] and Cp[phi] of various Na+ and K+ salts to Young's rule was examined up to high concentrations using the present and literature data. Young's rule was then used to estimate hypothetical values of CpV[phi] and V[phi] for the sparingly soluble Na 2 Ox at high ionic strengths, which are required for the thermodynamic modelling of Bayer liquors. The solubility of Na 2 Ox in various concentrated electrolytes was measured, at temperatures from 25 degrees C to 70 degrees C in media both with (NaCl, NaClO 4, NaOH) and without a common ion (KCl, CsCl, TMACl). The common ion effect was found to dominate the solubility of Na 2 Ox. The solubility of calcium oxalate monohydrate (CaOx. H 2 O) was also determined. The solubilities of both Na 2 Ox and CaOx. H 2 O in media without a common ion increased with increasing electrolyte concentration, except in TMACl media, where they decreased. The solubility of Na 2 Ox was modelled using a Pitzer model assuming the Pitzer parameters for Na 2 SO 4 and minimising the free energy of the system. The data were modelled successfully over the full concentration and temperature range of all the electrolytes, including ternary (mixed electrolyte) solutions...|$|E

These materials inevitably introduce various impurities {{to the production}} furnaces, which can change the chemical composition, and thereafter, the {{physical and chemical properties}} of the products and by-products of the operation. Alumina {{is one of the most}} common and <b>significant</b> <b>impurities</b> that enter the furnaces in different ways, including recycling of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). In order to control and optimize the outcome of the process, a deep understanding of influences of alumina on slag properties is an essence. In the current work, a combination of different experimental techniques and thermodynamic calculations was carried out to investigate the effects of alumina on some of the most important properties of an industrial iron-silicate or fayalite-type slag, from a Swedish base and precious metals producer. For this purpose, a reference slag sample, devoid of alumina addition, and three different mixtures of slag with 5, 10, and 15 wt-% alumina additions were prepared and used for evaluation of density, surface tension, thermal diffusivity, viscosity, melting behaviour, mineralogy and leaching characteristics. Results show that in this type of slag, aluminium can be tetrahedrally coordinated and behave as a network former cation. As a result, increasing the alumina concentration leads to polymerization of the melt, and consequently, an increase in viscosity and thermal diffusivity. It is observed that alumina addition to the slag leads to formation of units with relatively higher molar volumes, which reduces the measured density of the material. Slag samples with higher alumina contents exhibit higher surface tensions, primarily due to the relative lower concentration of the surface-active components. By 5 wt-% alumina addition to the system, the liquidus temperature decreases slightly. Further increase in alumina content (10 and 15 wt-% alumina additions) causes a change in primary crystallization phase field of the material from fayalite (Fe 2 SiO 4) to hercynite (FeAl 2 O 4). This change is associated with a rise in liquidus temperature; however, the solidus temperature of the slag remains almost constant. The most important industrial characteristics of the slag (copper loss to the slag phase and foaming behaviour of the material) are definitely affected by such changes in slag composition and physical properties. Influence of alumina on these two phenomena were not investigated experimentally in the current work, but discussed, theoretically, based on the available literature. Mineralogical studies of the semi-rapidly solidified samples reveal that alumina addition to this type of slag changes the composition and concentration of major phases that are present in the material, which directly controls the leachability of different elements from the slag. It was found that in the current system, spinel and anorthite are the most leaching resistant phases, which are followed by olivine, clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene, respectively. Therefore, among the investigated samples in this study, the mixture of slag with 10 wt-% alumina addition shows the lowest leachability of most of the elements. As expected, by changing the cooling condition of the samples (i. e. water granulation), a totally different dissolution rate of the elements was observed. It is shown that leaching of the generated amorphous structures is a complex phenomenon that is controlled by other mechanisms than that of the semi-rapidly cooled samples.

40|$|The {{disposal}} of waste {{electrical and electronic equipment}} (WEEE) into landfill is no longer acceptable in most countries. WEEE contains toxic materials which cause environmental damage when they leach from landfill, but it also contains significant amounts of valuable metals and thus represents a potential resource for these metals. Reprocessing WEEE presents many technical challenges. The combination of metals found in WEEE {{is not the same as}} that found in ores, so the smelting techniques and slag systems that produce good recoveries of valuable metals from concentrates may not also produce high recoveries from WEEE. One attractive option for reprocessing WEEE is to add it to the feed to a secondary copper smelter using the traditional black copper route. Good examples of valuable minor elements in WEEE are tin and indium. The distribution behaviour of tin in common slags in copper smelting, calcium ferrite slag and ferrous silicate slag, is known but the behaviour of tin in ferrous calcium silicate slag is unknown. The way in which indium distributes in such a smelting circuit is also unknown because it is not a <b>significant</b> <b>impurity</b> in most copper ores. In this work the distribution of tin and indium between molten copper and slags whose compositions lie within the CaO-SiO 2 -FeOx (FCS) slag system has been reviewed. The results of experimental determinations of the tin and indium distribution at 1300 oC have been reported and were used to calculate the activity coefficient of tin oxide and indium oxide in the slags. The activity coefficient data was utilised in a thermodynamic model of a secondary copper smelter to predict the way in which tin and indium deports to the various phases during the major processing stages...|$|R
40|$|The {{capability}} of Ion Cyclotron Resonance Frequency (ICRF) systems to reliably inject high power levels into ELMy plasmas is essential {{both for the}} JET research program and for future ITER operations. In parallel with the installation and commissioning of the ITER-like antenna (ILA), the conventional ICRF A 2 antenna system has been significantly modified to improve its performance. The ILA consists of a closely packed array of 4 Resonant Double Loops with in-vessel matching capacitors and low impedance Conjugate-T points. It has demonstrated efficient trip-free ELM tolerant operation on ELMy plasmas with high power densities (up to 6. 2 MW/m 2 on L-mode and 4. 1 MW/m 2 on H-mode) and voltages up to 42 kV without <b>significant</b> <b>impurity</b> production. The ILA further provided validation of the ICRF coupling modeling code Topica. This is relevant for antenna design for ITER as it demonstrates that with ITER's presently estimated density proles its proposed ICRF system is able to couple 20 MW with a system voltage below 45 kV. The conjugate-T junction principle was also used by pairing straps from A 2 antennas C and D thus creating 4 conjugate-T points outside the vacuum vessel. Additionally, the load tolerant circuit installed in 2005, based on 3 dB hybrid couplers feeding straps from A 2 antenna arrays A and B in pairs, was updated for more extensive use. Both load tolerant approaches have demonstrated robust and reliable performance during operations {{in a variety of}} plasma loading conditions including on large Type I ELMs. Depending on the plasma scenario, the trip-free time-average power levels coupled to ELMy H-mode plasma during long pulse operations have reached 3. 3 MW for the 3 dB hybrid and 4 MW for the External Conjugate-T (ECT) system. Up to 7 MW total ICRF power was coupled to ELMy plasmas simultaneously by all four conventional JET ICRF antenna...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study the chemical reactivity of a somatostatin analogue octreotide acetate, formulated in microspheres with polymers of varying molecular weight and co-monomer ratio under in vitro testing conditions. Poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and poly(D,L-lactide) (PLA) microspheres were prepared by a solvent extraction/evaporation method. The microspheres were characterized for drug load, impurity content, and particle size. Further, the microspheres were subjected to in vitro release testing in acetate buffer (pH 4. 0) and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7. 2). In acetate buffer, 3 microsphere batches composed of low molecular weight PLGA 50 ∶ 50, PLGA 85 ∶ 15, and PLA polymers (≤ 10 kDa) showed 100 % release with minimal impurity formation (< 10 %). The high molecular weight PLGA 50 ∶ 50 microspheres (28 kDa) displayed only 70 % cumulative release in acetate buffer with <b>significant</b> <b>impurity</b> formation (∼ 24 %). In PBS (pH 7. 4), on the other hand, only 50 % release was observed with the same low molecular weight batches (PLGA 50 ∶ 50, PLGA 85 ∶ 15, and PLA) with higher percentages of hydrophobic impurity formation (ie, 40 %, 26 %, and 10 %, respectively). In addition, in PBS, the high molecular weight PLGA 50 ∶ 50 microspheres showed only 20 % drug release with ∼ 60 % mean impurity content. The chemically modified peptide impurities inside microspheres were structurally confirmed through Fourier transform-mass spectrometry (FT-MS) and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses after extraction procedures. The adduct compounds were identified as covalently modified conjugates of octreotide with lactic and glycolic acid monomers within polymeric microspheres. The data suggest that due to steric hindrance factors, polymers with greater lactide content were less amenable to the formation of adduct impurities compared with PLGA 50 ∶ 50 copolymers...|$|R
