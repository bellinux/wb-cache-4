Also in June 2010, May banned the Indian Muslim preacher Zakir Naik from entering the United Kingdom. According to The Telegraph, a Home Office official who disagreed with this decision was suspended. In late June 2010, May announced plans for a temporary cap on UK visas for non-EU migrants.

[...] The Homeland Security report produced by the Inspector General revealed that this air marshal had noticed that the Syrians' travel visas were expired but the air marshal failed to report this information to his supervisors, claiming it was out of his jurisdiction.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the risk}} {{assessment}} complete, the IA practitioner then develops a risk management plan. This plan proposes countermeasures that involve mitigating, eliminating, accepting, or transferring the risks, and considers prevention, detection, {{and response to}} threats. A framework published by a standards organization, such as Risk IT, CobiT, PCI DSS or ISO/IEC 27002, may guide development. Countermeasures may include technical tools such as firewalls and anti-virus software, policies and procedures requiring such controls as regular backups and configuration hardening, employee training in security awareness, or organizing personnel into dedicated computer emergency response team (CERT) or computer <b>security</b> <b>incident</b> response team (CSIRT). [...] The cost and benefit of each countermeasure is carefully considered. Thus, the IA practitioner does not seek to eliminate all risks, were that possible, but to manage them in the most cost-effective way.|$|E

40|$|Educational {{institutions}} are the step for defense through training and educating (Mensch & Wilkie, 2011). The role {{of education in}} information security is to reduce risk, reduce incidents, and increase preventive actions. But does education decrease <b>security</b> <b>incidents</b> of being a victim and increase preventive actions? Nothing {{was found in the}} literature that shows education will lower the number of <b>security</b> <b>incidents</b> of being a victim. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to determine if <b>security</b> <b>incidents</b> can be lowered by education. Findings showed that education does increase preventative behavior and is unrelated to the number of <b>security</b> <b>incidents.</b> An interesting find was the more preventative behavior, the more <b>security</b> <b>incidents</b> occurred.

40|$|Abstract. Internet is {{inundated}} with {{large amount of}} intrusion, attack and other <b>security</b> <b>incidents,</b> which have posed {{a serious threat to}} network security. Security evaluation is one of the important management means throughout the life cycle of information system; it is also a basis and premise of formulating and adjusting the security strategies. Accurately predicting the impending <b>security</b> <b>incidents</b> and evaluating the possible degree of detriment are the decision-making foundation in network security defense. In this paper, a hierarchical detriment evaluation method of <b>security</b> <b>incidents</b> is put forward, after direct detriment is calculated,indirect detriment of the incidents is calculated based on service dependence and permission transfer relations, and then, the overall detriment of <b>security</b> <b>incidents</b> is obtained...|$|R
2500|$|Ritchie's {{tenure as}} Commandant of Sandhurst {{coincided with the}} {{attendance}} of Princes William and Harry at the academy, but was marred {{by a series of}} high-profile security breaches by journalists. In June 2005, a tabloid reporter successfully smuggled a fake bomb into the academy, and also claimed to have filmed footage of Prince Harry in the supposedly secure military compound. The incident prompted a full security review by Defence Secretary John Reid. In August 2005, a journalist for another tabloid was successfully offered a job at Sandhurst despite using obviously fake credentials. [...] A further <b>security</b> <b>incident</b> occurred in January 2006, when the entire camp went into alert over a bomb; it later {{turned out to be a}} false alarm caused by a fake bomb made for cadet exercises, which had been fallen off a vehicle and then been found by Ritchie, who then raised the alarm. It was reported in the Daily Telegraph in January 2006 that in the ensuing controversy, Ritchie was saved from being sacked by a personal intervention from Prince Charles, with the Prince of Wales reported to have made [...] "'high-level' phone calls of support" [...] to government ministers and senior officials, and issuing [...] "a hand-written letter" [...] of support for Ritchie. Ritchie resigned as Commandant of Sandhurst in April 2006, resigning from the army shortly thereafter. At the time of his resignation, Ritchie had been assigned to serve a tour of duty of up to four months in Iraq, but the timing of his resignation meant that he did not end up going there.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{includes}} a positive analysis to quantitatively grasp {{the relationship among}} vulnerability, information <b>security</b> <b>incidents,</b> and the countermeasures by using data based on a 2007 questionnaire survey for Japanese ISPs (Internet Service Providers). To grasp the relationships, logistic regression analysis is used. The results clarify that there are relationships between information <b>security</b> <b>incidents</b> and the countermeasures. Concretely, {{there is a positive}} relationship between information <b>security</b> <b>incidents</b> and the number of information security systems introduced as well as a negative relationship between information <b>security</b> <b>incidents</b> and information <b>security</b> education. It is also pointed out that (especially, local) ISPs do not execute efficient information security countermeasures/investment concerned with systems, and it is suggested that they should positively execute information security education. In addition, to further heighten the information security level of Japanese telecommunication infrastructure, the necessity and importance of the government to implement policy to support the countermeasures of ISPs is insisted.

40|$|This paper investigates how the {{characteristics}} of information <b>security</b> <b>incidents</b> and disclosures in financial reports affect the valuation of a firm. Building on theories of disclosures in the accounting literature, we investigate investor reaction to disclosures through both quantitative and qualitative analyses. A cross-sectional analysis is first performed to {{examine the effect of}} the number of disclosures on stock price reactions to information <b>security</b> <b>incidents.</b> The results suggest that information security risk factors disclosed in financial reports increases the impact of information <b>security</b> <b>incidents.</b> Such an observation is consistent with investors perceiving the disclosures as a warning of future incidents. In order to provide a richer interpretation of the results, we further explore the contents of the disclosures using text mining techniques. One of the key findings is that breached firms react to information <b>security</b> <b>incidents</b> by disclosing additional and more specific risk factors. We further build a model to link disclosures with different stock price reactions to information <b>security</b> <b>incidents</b> to provide insights into how companies should disclose security concerns and practices. The model suggests that the disclosures associated with non-negative reactions are more generic and includ...|$|R

40|$|Modeling the {{occurrence}} of computer <b>security</b> <b>incidents</b> within a defined population of computers {{can be used to}} help understand some of factors contributing to risk and transmission of these incidents among the population. A better understanding of these factors can be used to determine appropriate intervention actions that {{can be applied to the}} population, which may also be evaluated through the application of models. Explanatory models attempt to include and account for various primary factors that affect {{the occurrence}} of computer <b>security</b> <b>incidents.</b> Models based on observed <b>security</b> <b>incidents</b> may also be used to evaluate interventions even when explanatory models may not exist or may be difficult to formulate or express for a particular incident type. Forecasting models can be used to project {{the occurrence of}} incidents in the future and these projections can be compared to actual observations before and after interventions are applied. The following aspects of modeling computer <b>security</b> <b>incidents</b> are explored: (1) the presentation and discussion of adapting some commonly used infectious disease models for modeling the spread of some types of computer <b>security</b> <b>incidents</b> along with applicable intervention actions; (2) an illustration of how these types of models could be applied to making resource allocation decisions regarding intervention efforts; (3) the presentation and comparison of models that can be used for tracking/forecasting <b>security</b> <b>incidents</b> and monitoring the impact of interventions; (4) the presentation of a method for estimating model features and parameter distributions from observed data; and (5) the exploration of some population characteristics and models for evaluating where to focus or target intervention actions.
