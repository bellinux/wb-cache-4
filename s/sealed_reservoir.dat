40|$|There is a {{need for}} {{reliable}} valves and pumps in microfluidics. A good microactuator is the key for low cost and high performance of these components. Paraffin wax is a promising material to be used as actuator material as is can produce large forces and large strokes. Further, the material is inexpensive and, none the less, the thermal heating of the material can be made with low voltages. All these properties are of interest in flow control components in microfluidics, and especially for disposables and in potable systems. In this work, paraffin wax has been used in devices and concepts. A valve for high-pressures, a peristaltic pump, a multi-stable actuator, and injector has been shown. A material study was performed on binary mixtures of pure paraffin (n-alkanes), and a concept for loading fluid into a <b>sealed</b> <b>reservoir</b> was shown as well. Several injectors were demonstrated in a Lab-on-a-chip system with other microfluidic components. High pressure applications in microfluidics along with the multi-stable actuator show good potential.

40|$|A {{petroleum}} system {{encompasses a}} hydrocarbon source rock and all generated {{oil and gas}} accumulations and includes all the geologic elements and processes that are essential if an oil and gas deposit is to exist. Petroleum includes concentrated occurrences {{of any of the}} following substances: thermal and microbial natural gas found in conventional reservoirs as well as in gas hydrate, tight sandstone, fractured shale, and coal; and condensates, crude oils, heavy oils, and solid bitumen found in reservoirs in siliciclastic and carbonate rocks. System describes the interdependent geologic elements that create oil and gas accumulations. These elements include a petroleum source rock, migration path, reservoir rock, seal, and trap; and the geologic processes that create each of these basic elements. All these elements must be correctly placed in time and space so that organic matter included in a source rock can be converted into a petroleum deposit. A petroleum system exists wherever all the basic elements are known to occur or are thought to occur.

40|$|The {{study of}} natural analogues can inform the {{long-term}} performance security of engineered CO 2 storage. There are natural CO 2 reservoirs and CO 2 seeps in Italy. Here, we study nine reservoirs and establish which are sealed or are leaking CO 2 to surface. Their characteristics are compared to elucidate which conditions control CO 2 leakage. All {{of the case}} studies would fail current CO 2 storage site selection criteria, though only two leak CO 2 to surface. The factors found to systematically affect seal performance are overburden geopressure and proximity to modern extensional faults. Amongst our case studies, the <b>sealing</b> <b>reservoirs</b> show elevated overburden geopressure whereas the leaking reservoirs don’t. Since the leaking reservoirs are located within < 10 km of modern extensional faults, pressure equilibration within the overburden may be facilitated by enhanced crustal permeability related to faulting. Modelling of the properties that could enable the observed CO 2 leakage rates finds high permeability pathways (such as transmissive faults or fractures) become increasingly necessary to sustain leak rates as CO 2 density decreases during ascent to surface, regardless of the leakage mechanism into the overburden. This work illustrates the value of characterising the overburden geology during CO 2 storage site selection to inform screening criterion, risk assessment and monitoring strategy...|$|R

50|$|A {{petroleum}} seep {{occurs as}} a result of the <b>seal</b> above the <b>reservoir</b> being breached, causing tertiary migration of hydrocarbons towards the surface under the influence of the associated buoyancy force. The seal is breached due to the effects of overpressure adding to the buoyancy force, overcoming the capillary resistance that initially kept the hydrocarbons sealed.|$|R
50|$|Most geologists {{agree that}} crude becomes ‘heavy’ {{as a result}} of biodegradation, in which lighter ends are {{preferentially}} consumed by bacterial activity in the reservoir, leaving heavier hydrocarbons behind. This hypothesis leans heavily on the techniques of petroleum geochemistry. Poor geologic <b>reservoir</b> <b>sealing</b> exposes the hydrocarbon to surface contaminants, including organic life (such as bacteria) and contributes to this process.|$|R
30|$|It {{should be}} noted that {{although}} hydrocarbon enrichment is favored by better conditions of source rocks, <b>reservoirs,</b> <b>seals,</b> and other necessary elements, it is virtually impossible for all these factors to concurrently achieve their respective best conditions. In nature, the sufficient development of any one of the above factors is commonly {{at the expense of other}} conditions. For instance, assuming that the condition of hydrocarbon generation in a given region is adequately developed (i.e., the thickness of source rocks and the abundance of organic matter attain their maximum), the reservoir condition therein is commonly less developed. In contrast, if the reservoir quality is excellent (large reservoir thickness and excellent rock properties), then the hydrocarbon-generating and sealing conditions may be relatively inferior. As a result, the most favorable conditions for the enrichment of tight oil/gas exist where an optimal association of source, <b>reservoir,</b> <b>sealing,</b> and all other necessary conditions is realized. This ought to be a universal rule for various oil and gas enrichment.|$|R
40|$|The {{region of}} {{investigation}} {{is located in}} the Norwegian Sea, which is an area of high hydrocarbon activity. Many reservoirs have been successfully identified, drilled, and now they are producing in large oil & gas fields. However, the Norwegian Sea has a complex geology as it resulted from Permian to Late Jurassic crustal extension, which created rift basins and several horst and graben structures. Most of the important hydrocarbon reservoirs in the Norwegian Sea are Jurassic. Because of the complex geology, identifying these reservoirs and successfully positioning wells is challenging. The research for this project is conducted on a dry well, 6407 / 10 - 5 in area 793 that was drilled along the western fault bounded Frøya High in the Norwegian Sea. The Frøya High is a Triassic paleo-uplift: a NNE-SSW trending horst bounded by the Vingleia and Klakk fault complexes on the eastern side and a major fault on the western side, which separates it from the Froan Basin. A Jurassic rollover anticline developed along the western margin of the Frøya High where the well is located. Since 2015, many fields such as Pil, Bue and Snilehorn, have been discovered in the same geological trend. However, in the study area, the two wells 6407 / 10 - 1 and 6407 / 10 - 2, drilled in the 1980 s, only contain hydrocarbon shows, and the newly drilled well 6407 / 10 - 5 is dry. This study focuses on identifying the failure reason of the dry well 6407 / 10 - 5. Newly acquired 3 D seismic data covering the study area, well reports, log data and geochemical reports of the wells 6407 / 10 - 1 and 6407 / 10 - 2 are used for the project. This research provides an understanding of the geological elements of the petroleum system of the study area i. e., <b>seal,</b> <b>reservoir,</b> source and trap, which lead to debate the reasons for failure of the well. A set of methodologies are defined to test each element. Here, local source is not functional and top <b>seal</b> of the <b>reservoir</b> is heavily faulted.

50|$|Operation {{required}} several valves; {{when the}} reservoir was empty {{at the start}} of a cycle a valve was opened to admit steam. The valve was closed to <b>seal</b> the <b>reservoir</b> and the cooling water valve turned on to condense the steam and create a partial vacuum. A supply valve was opened, pulling water upward into the reservoir, and the typical engine could pull water up to 20 feet. This was closed and the steam valve reopened, building pressure over the water and pumping it upward, as in the Worcester design. The cycle essentially doubled the distance that water could be pumped for any given pressure of steam, and production examples raised water about 40 feet.|$|R
40|$|Integration of sedimentologic and {{sequence}} stratigraphic {{interpretations of the}} Nkporo Group has {{provided the basis for}} a basin-wide framework for prediction of potential source, <b>seal</b> and <b>reservoir</b> rocks in the Anambra Basin, Nigeria. Lithofacies and biostratigraphic data show that the Nkporo Group in the Anambra Basin contains three main facies associations (fluvio-deltaic facies, estuarine central basin/shallow shelf facies and estuarine channel fill facies) that determine the reservoir containers, flow units and seals. The units are arranged to form two stratigraphic sequences represented by the Nkporo Shale–Owelli Sandstone and Owelli Sandstone–Enugu Shale successions, respectively. The transgressive systems tract in each sequence comprises coarse-grained fluvio-deltaic sandstone and an overlying open marine black carbonaceous mud rock. The highstand systems tracts comprise delta front deposits with average porosity, permeability and net-to-gross values estimated in the ranges of 30 %, 3000  md and 0. 9, respectively. The fluvio-deltaic and delta front facies which are encased in organically rich estuarine central basin/shallow shelf mud rocks are likely the potential reservoirs. Trapping capacity is enhanced by the presence of several N–S trending normal faults, and other microstructures related to the post-Santonian tensional regime in the Benue. The new information presented in this paper on potential <b>seal,</b> source and <b>reservoir</b> lithofacies within the Nkporo Group should serve as a useful contribution to the geological modelling of reservoirs within the Late Cretaceous–Paleocene succession in the Anambra Basin...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies in}} the Danish North Sea {{concluded}} that slumped chalk deposits may contain good reservoir properties. The relative amount of cement is less and the rapid burial may promote the preservation of porosity. The possibility of slumps acting as a stratigraphic trap is rarely studied in the Netherlands. A detailed understanding of slump deposits, in terms of architecture, triggering mechanisms and rock properties are necessary {{for the evaluation of}} the reservoir potential. In this study five slumps in the chalk formation in the B-Block of the Dutch offshore were investigated. The B-blocks are located most closely to the Danish offshore, where the first chalk oilfield was discovered. The investigated slumps are generally recognized by normal faulting at the head, reverse faulting to the toe, a rotational rupture surface and the slump mass consists of internal deformation. Four of the five investigated slumps, present in the Central Graben and Step Graben, were triggered due to the halokinesis of the underlying Zechstein salt. The reservoir potential is evaluated by using 3 D seismic interpretation with well log correlation, acoustic impedance inversion and a porosity prediction. The chalk formation is characterized by several different internal structures and geometries, such as unconformities and slumps. Therefore, an important approach in this study is the use of a highly detailed low frequency model. In creating a HorizonCube, all internal reflectors are tracked in 3 D and used to create a geologically correct low frequency model. The rock property modeling showed that the upper chalk consists of higher porosity values than the lower chalk. In some cases, the slumping mechanisms have influence on the porosity but this is not consistent for all slumps. The porosity prediction and qualitative ranking of geological elements of a petroleum system concludes that the investigated slumps in this research area are not well suitable for hydrocarbon exploration, thus stating a low reservoir potential. However, since the slumps constitute <b>seal,</b> <b>reservoir</b> and source rock, additional research in this field is expected to give more insight the potential of hydrocarbon exploration in chalk formations...|$|R

30|$|Traps are {{structural}} or stratigraphic {{features that}} ensure that accumulated hydrocarbon {{are held in}} a fixed and firm position of <b>seal</b> and <b>reservoir</b> to avoid the escape {{of oil and gas}} to the surface.

These structures are believed to have formed due to response of sediment package to syn-sedimentary deformation (Obi and Okogbue 2004; Dim et al. 2017).
