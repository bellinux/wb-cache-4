60|$|When {{he could}} look down again it was like looking down upon the crater of a small volcano. In the open garden before the Imperial castle a shuddering star of evil splendour spurted and poured up smoke and flame towards them like an accusation. They were too high to {{distinguish}} people clearly, or mark the bomb's effect upon the building until suddenly the facade tottered and crumbled before the flare as <b>sugar</b> <b>dissolves</b> in water. The man stared for a moment, showed all his long teeth, and then staggered into the cramped standing position his straps permitted, hoisted out and bit another bomb, and sent it down after its fellow.|$|E
50|$|Here {{designs in}} a syrupy {{solution}} of sugar or Camp Coffee are painted onto the metal surface prior to it being coated in a liquid etching ground or 'stop out' varnish. When later the plate {{is placed in}} hot water the <b>sugar</b> <b>dissolves</b> and lifts off leaving the image. The plate can then be etched.|$|E
5000|$|Complexation and {{solvation}} is {{also caused}} by specific interactions of functional groups. In the common {{rule of thumb}} [...] "like dissolves like", it is the shared or mutually well-interacting functional groups which give rise to solubility. For example, <b>sugar</b> <b>dissolves</b> in water because both share the hydroxyl functional group (-OH) and hydroxyls interact strongly with each other.|$|E

5000|$|A common Tico drink called [...] "agua dulce" [...] {{is made of}} tapa de dulce, or raw cane <b>sugar,</b> <b>dissolved</b> in hot water. This drink is {{particularly}} common in the cooler highlands and surrounding mountains of the country.|$|R
50|$|Asbach Uralt {{brandy and}} sugar cubes {{are added to}} a cup. In Rüdesheim, a cup that is {{specially}} designed for this beverage is used. The brandy is flambéed and stirred for a minute until the <b>sugar</b> <b>dissolves.</b> Strong coffee is added, followed by a topping of thickly whipped cream sweetened with vanilla sugar. Chocolate flakes are scattered onto the cream as a garnish.|$|E
50|$|Many edible beans, {{including}} {{broad beans}} and soybeans, contain oligosaccharides (particularly raffinose and stachyose), {{a type of}} sugar molecule also found in cabbage. An anti-oligosaccharide enzyme is necessary to properly digest these sugar molecules. As a normal human digestive tract does not contain any anti-oligosaccharide enzymes, consumed oligosaccharides are typically digested by bacteria in the large intestine. This digestion process produces flatulence-causing gases as a byproduct. Since <b>sugar</b> <b>dissolves</b> in water, another method of reducing flatulence associated with eating beans is to drain the water in which the beans have been cooked.|$|E
50|$|This mix can {{be stored}} {{for a long time}} at room {{temperature}} {{as long as it is}} sealed in an airtight container to prevent the moisture from soaking the sugar further. Whenever Anarsas are to be prepared, mash half inch piece of banana and mix into the previously prepared dough-balls. The banana ensures the <b>sugar</b> <b>dissolves</b> so be careful not to mix too much of banana. The resultant dough should be very soft yet retain shape. Small flat discs with about 2 inches in diameter are created by flattening a small ball of the dough over a layer of poppy seeds - just on one side. These disks are fried with poppy coated side first into hot ghee.|$|E
25|$|Historically {{the various}} stages were {{performed}} manually {{but the whole}} process is now automated for most wines. In connection with the filling of the missing volume, {{it is common to}} add a certain amount of <b>sugar</b> <b>dissolved</b> in wine to give the sparkling wine a smoother taste. Sugar addition is called dosage and the added liquid liqueur d'expedition.|$|R
50|$|The {{blanketing}} of {{the sludge}} enables a dual solid and hydraulic (liquid) retention {{time in the}} digesters. Solids requiring {{a high degree of}} digestion can remain in the reactors for periods up to 90 days. <b>Sugars</b> <b>dissolved</b> in the liquid waste stream can be converted into gas quickly in the liquid phase which can exit the system in less than a day.|$|R

50|$|Sugar {{functions}} as a sweetener, stabilizer, and tenderizer. The amount of sugar has a large impact on the overrun and stability of the foam. When sugar and egg whites are whipped together, a meringue is formed. If the amount of sugar is {{less than or equal}} to the amount of egg whites, a soft meringue is formed. A stiffer meringue is formed when there is more sugar than egg white. Angel food cakes usually have equal parts sugar and egg white. Sugar will disturb protein foam formation in a positive or negative manner. It is also important that the sugar is added slowly, so that the crystals have a chance to dissolve. It is typically added after a weak foam has been formed. This way it can help stabilize the foam instead of impeding on it, causing coagulation and collapse. When the <b>sugar</b> <b>dissolves,</b> it interacts with the proteins at the air/water interface, creating a thicker and more stable cell wall. The sugar can also assist in the denaturing and aggregation of egg white proteins, which increases overrun, giving a lighter texture. Sugar binds water through hydrogen bonds, which allows for a moist final cake and why all of the moisture does not leave during baking.|$|E
50|$|Typical {{ingredients}} of the melomakarono are flour or semolina, sugar, orange zest and/or fresh juice, cognac (or similar beverage), cinnamon and olive oil. During rolling {{they are often}} filled with ground walnuts. Immediately after baking, they are immersed {{for a few seconds}} in cold syrup made of honey and <b>sugar</b> <b>dissolved</b> in water. Finally, they are decorated with ground, as well as bigger pieces of walnut. Dark chocolate-covered melomakarona are also a more recent variation of the traditional recipe.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Behaviorism {{dominated}} {{the field of}} SLA {{until the end of}} the 1960 s and found its most visible application in contrastive analysis and the audiolingual method (Johnson, 2004, p. 10). In this tradition, the focus was on the learner’s external environment. By now it is consensus that a mature psychology will contain a level of intermediate theory which bridges the divide between physiology and behavior, but there is disagreement over the best way to do that (Reisman, 2003).

50|$|There is {{a common}} belief that {{superheating}} can occur only in pure substances. This is untrue, as superheating has been observed in coffee and other impure liquids. Impurities do prevent superheating if they introduce nucleation sites (rough areas where gas is trapped); for example, sand tends to suppress superheating in water. Dissolved gas can also provide nucleation sites {{when it comes out}} of solution and forms bubbles. However, an impurity such as salt or <b>sugar,</b> <b>dissolved</b> in water to form a homogeneous solution, does not prevent superheating. Other liquids are known to superheat including 2% milk and almond milk.|$|R
50|$|Until the 1840s, punsch {{was served}} as a warm punch, created just before consumption: a sugarloaf was placed upright in a large bowl, hot water was poured over it to make the <b>sugar</b> <b>dissolve,</b> and arrack, unflavoured spirits and German Rhine wine was added. Still warm, the drink was then served in cups. However, in 1845 wine {{importing}} company J. Cederlunds Söner started selling premixed punsch in bottles, quickly followed by several other manufacturers, and the habit of drinking punsch cold as a liqueur began to take hold. However, on Thursdays, punsch is still traditionally served warm with Swedish pea & pork soup and pancakes.|$|R

50|$|In cooking, a syrup or sirup (from شراب; sharāb, beverage, wine, via sirupus) is a {{condiment}} {{that is a}} thick, {{viscous liquid}} consisting primarily of a solution of sugar in water, containing {{a large amount of}} <b>dissolved</b> <b>sugars</b> but showing little tendency to deposit crystals. Its consistency {{is similar to that of}} molasses. The viscosity arises from the multiple hydrogen bonds between the <b>dissolved</b> <b>sugar,</b> which has many hydroxyl (OH) groups, and the water.|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} making panforte is fairly simple. <b>Sugar</b> is <b>dissolved</b> in honey and various nuts, fruits and spices are mixed {{together}} with flour.

5000|$|The high {{green syrup}} {{is fed to a}} raw sugar vacuum pan {{from which a}} second batch of sugar is {{produced}}. This sugar ("raw") is of lower quality with more colour and impurities, and is the main source of the <b>sugar</b> <b>dissolved</b> again into the mother liquor. The syrup from the raw (Low green syrup) is boiled {{for a long time in}} AP Pans and sent to slowly flow around a series of about eight crystallisers. From this, a very low-quality sugar crystal is produced (known in some systems as [...] "AP sugar") that is also redissolved. The syrup separated is molasses, which still contains sugar, but contains too much impurity to undergo further processing economically. The molasses is stored on site and is added to dried beet pulp to make animal feed. Some is also sold in bulk tankers.|$|R
50|$|Poured fondant {{is formed}} by supersaturating water with sucrose. More {{than twice as}} much <b>sugar</b> will <b>dissolve</b> in water at the boiling point as will at room temperature. After the sucrose is dissolved, if the {{solution}} is left to cool undisturbed, the <b>sugar</b> will remain <b>dissolved</b> in a supersaturated solution until nucleation occurs. While the solution is supersaturated, if a seed crystal (undissolved sucrose) falls into the mix, or if the solution is agitated, the dissolved sucrose crystallizes to form large, crunchy crystals (which is how rock candy is made). However, if the solution is allowed to cool undisturbed, and then stirred vigorously, it forms many tiny crystals, resulting in a smooth textured fondant.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} patterns of students’ science thinking across four different science phenomena, focusing on changes {{with age and}} science education. British secondary school students in three age-groups were offered sentences appearing {{on a computer screen}} that gave different explanations for four common changes in materials: ice melting, <b>sugar</b> <b>dissolving</b> in water, a candle burning and an iron nail rusting. The students were asked whether the sentences 'made sense' to them. The sentences, composed of fixed terms, were designed to embody good science explanations, common misconceptions, and basic descriptive and causal categories relating to the physical world. They were generated from a systemic network of explanation types. Results enabled new distinctions to be made between students’ ideas at substance, molecular and atomic level according to their length of time in science education. Implications regarding the age at which students are introduced to atomic theory are considered...|$|R

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to verify a theoretical model on the injection efficiency of sources in the cladding of an optical fiber. The theoretical results predicted {{an increase in the}} injection efficiency for higher differences in refractive indices between the core and cladding. The experimental apparatus used consisted of a glass rod 50 cm long, coated at one end with a thin film of fluorescent substance. The fluorescent substance was excited with side illumination, perpendicular to the rod axis, using a 476 nm Argon-ion laser. Part of the excited fluorescence was injected into the core and guided to a detector. The signal was measured for several different cladding refractive indices. The cladding consisted of <b>sugar</b> <b>dissolved</b> in water and the refractive index was changed by varying the sugar concentration in the solution. The results indicate that the power injected into the rod, due to evanescent wave injection, increases with the difference in refractive index which is in qualitative agreement with theory...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the process}} of {{cellulase}} pretreatment before alkali-oxygen pulping of bagasse was studied. The effect of cellulase pretreatment on subsequent pulping was also researched. The results showed that some small-sized components and <b>sugars</b> <b>dissolved</b> into the effluent in {{the process of}} cellulase pretreatment. UV spectroscopy showed that there was no significant lignin content in the pretreatment effluent. It was also found that pulping properties were promoted when the cellulase dosage was 2 ECU/g pulp, in that under the same cooking conditions, pulp kappa number was decreased by 1. 3 and pulp brightness was increased by 2. 5 %ISO, while the viscosity of pulp also increased slightly. Moreover, the tensile index, tear index and folding endurance were increased by 8 %, 7 % and 30 %, respectively, but burst index showed no significant change. The above results illustrated that cellulase pretreatment was only beneficial to the dissolution of sugars and fine components from bagasse and it was an effective method of promoting alkali-oxygen pulping of bagasse...|$|R
50|$|The {{raw sugar}} was refined {{by a series}} of boiling and {{filtering}} processes. When, at the final boiling, it was considered ready for granulation it was poured into a large number of inverted conical molds. These were usually made of either brown earthenware or sheet iron with an internal treatment of slip or paint respectively, and each stood in its own collecting pot. Over the next few days most of the dark syrup and noncrystalline matter drained through a small hole {{in the bottom of the}} mould into the collecting pot. To improve the whiteness of the sugar repeated applications of either a solution of white clay or of loaf <b>sugar</b> <b>dissolved</b> in warm water was applied to the broad end of the loaf. This slowly drained through the loaf readily uniting with any remaining molasses or other coloring matter and removing it to the collecting pot. The loaves were then tapped out of the molds, dried in a stove room that would have contained hundreds of loaves, trimmed to their final shape and wrapped, usually, in blue paper to enhance their whiteness.|$|R
