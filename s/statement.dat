5|$|Another {{application}} of such chain conditions is in Noetherian induction—also known as well-founded induction—which is a generalization of mathematical induction. It frequently {{is used to}} reduce general statements about collections of objects to statements about specific objects in that collection. Suppose that S is a partially ordered set. One way of proving a <b>statement</b> about the objects of S is to assume {{the existence of a}} counterexample and deduce a contradiction, thereby proving the contrapositive of the original <b>statement.</b> The basic premise of Noetherian induction is that every non-empty subset of S contains a minimal element. In particular, the set of all counterexamples contains a minimal element, the minimal counterexample. In order to prove the original <b>statement,</b> therefore, it suffices to prove something seemingly much weaker: For any counterexample, there is a smaller counterexample.|$|E

In addition, during inter-meeting periods, members of their board of governors often convey <b>statements</b> that contain policy inclination. Our empirical results show that to some extent Bank Indonesia's and Bank of Thailand's monetary policy <b>statements</b> and inter-meeting <b>statements</b> move short-term interest rates effectively. We find that there is asymmetry in {{the effects of the}} <b>statements,</b> that is, the <b>statements</b> with loose policy inclination tend to be more effective relative to the <b>statements</b> with tight policy inclination. communication, effectiveness, monetary policy, Bank Indonesia, Bank of Thailand...|$|R

The research utilizes Qualitative thematic analysis to identify the major themes underlying organizational Green <b>Statements.</b> The study draws from 131 Green <b>Statements</b> and compares them through a process of cross-analysis.

However, there are still baseline themes common in both Private and Public sector Green <b>Statements.</b> The study concludes that the content of Green <b>statements</b> is shaped by an organization’s internal and external context. Further research may wish to investigate the propensity of governments to influence private sector reporting behavior though their own Green <b>Statements...</b>|$|R
