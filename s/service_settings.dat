25|$|Individuals may {{arrive in}} {{psychiatric}} emergency <b>service</b> <b>settings</b> {{through their own}} voluntary request, a referral from another health professional, or through involuntary commitment. Care of patients requiring psychiatric intervention usually encompasses crisis stabilization of many serious and potentially life-threatening conditions which could include acute or chronic mental disorders or symptoms similar to those conditions.|$|E
25|$|In some locations, {{such as the}} United States, {{voluntary}} hospitalizations are {{outnumbered by}} involuntary commitments {{partly due to the}} fact that insurance tends not to pay for hospitalization unless an imminent danger exists to the individual or community. In addition, psychiatric emergency <b>service</b> <b>settings</b> admit approximately one third of patients from assertive community treatment centers. Therefore, patients who are not admitted will be referred to services in the community.|$|E
25|$|Electroconvulsive {{therapy is}} a {{controversial}} form of treatment which cannot be involuntarily applied in psychiatric emergency <b>service</b> <b>settings.</b> Instances wherein {{a patient is}} depressed to such a severe degree that the patient cannot be stopped from hurting himself or herself or when a patient refuses to swallow, eat or drink medication, electroconvulsive therapy could be suggested as a therapeutic alternative. While preliminary research suggests that electroconvulsive therapy may be an effective treatment for depression, it usually requires a course of six to twelve sessions of convulsions lasting at least 20 seconds for those antidepressant effects to occur.|$|E

25|$|Treatments in {{psychiatric}} emergency <b>service</b> <b>settings</b> are typically transitory {{in nature and}} only exist to provide dispositional solutions and/or to stabilize life-threatening conditions. Once stabilized, patients suffering chronic conditions may be transferred to a setting which can provide long term psychiatric rehabilitation. Prescribed treatments within the emergency service setting vary dependent upon the patient's condition. Different forms of psychiatric medication, psychotherapy, or electroconvulsive therapy {{may be used in}} the emergency setting. The introduction and efficacy of psychiatric medication as a treatment option in psychiatry has reduced the utilization of physical restraints in emergency settings, by reducing dangerous symptoms resulting from acute exacerbation of mental illness or substance intoxication.|$|E
25|$|As of 2000, the World Health Organization {{estimated}} {{one million}} suicides {{in the world}} each year. There are countless more suicide attempts. Psychiatric emergency <b>service</b> <b>settings</b> exist to treat the mental disorders {{associated with an increased}} risk of completed suicide or suicide attempts. Mental health professionals in these settings are expected to predict acts of violence patients may commit against themselves (or others), even though the complex factors leading to a suicide stem from so many sources, including psychosocial, biological, interpersonal, anthropological and religious. These mental health professionals will use any resources available to them to determine risk factors, make an overall assessment, and decide on any necessary treatment.|$|E
25|$|Patients with {{psychotic}} {{symptoms are}} common in psychiatric emergency <b>service</b> <b>settings.</b> The determination {{of the source of}} the psychosis can be difficult. Sometimes patients brought into the setting in a psychotic state have been disconnected from their previous treatment plan. While the psychiatric emergency service setting {{will not be able to}} provide long term care for these types of patients, it can exist to provide a brief respite and reconnect the patient to their case manager and/or reintroduce necessary psychiatric medication. A visit to a crisis unit by a patient suffering from a chronic mental disorder may also indicate the existence of an undiscovered precipitant, such as change in the lifestyle of the individual, or a shifting medical condition. These considerations can play a part in an improvement to an existing treatment plan.|$|E

5000|$|Four <b>services</b> (<b>settings</b> of canticles {{and other}} items for the new English Matins, Evensong and Communion services) have all survived in {{incomplete}} form, the Second Service being of interest in that it influenced the design of Byrd's Great Service (research by Richard Turbet). Sheppard's fifteen English anthems, {{most of which are}} a4, comply with the demands of the Protestant reformers for simplicity, clear, audible words and largely syllabic text-underlay. His five-part English setting of the Lord's Prayer nevertheless overcomes these limitations and achieves a degree of musical elaboration. The part-songs O happy dames and Vain, vain, all our life we spend in vain (both a4) are Sheppard's only known secular works.|$|R
25|$|Aggression can be {{the result}} of both {{internal}} and external factors that create a measurable activation in the autonomic nervous system. This activation can become evident through symptoms such as the clenching of fists or jaw, pacing, slamming doors, hitting palms of hands with fists, or being easily startled. It is estimated that 17% of visits to psychiatric emergency <b>service</b> <b>settings</b> are homicidal in origin and an additional 5% involve both suicide and homicide. Violence is also associated with many conditions such as acute intoxication, acute psychosis, paranoid personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder and borderline personality disorder. Additional risk factors have also been identified which may lead to violent behavior. Such risk factors may include prior arrests, presence of hallucinations, delusions or other neurological impairment, being uneducated, unmarried, etc. Mental health professionals complete violence risk assessments to determine both security measures and treatments for the patient.|$|E
25|$|Other {{treatment}} methods {{may be used}} in psychiatric emergency <b>service</b> <b>settings.</b> Brief psychotherapy can be used to treat acute conditions or immediate problems as long as the patient understands his or her issues are psychological, the patient trusts the physician, the physician can encourage hope for change, the patient has motivation to change, the physician is aware of the psychopathological history of the patient, and the patient understands that their confidentiality will be respected. The process of brief therapy under emergency psychiatric conditions includes the establishment of a primary complaint from the patient, realizing psychosocial factors, formulating an accurate representation of the problem, coming up with ways to solve the problem, and setting specific goals. The information gathering aspect of brief psychotherapy is therapeutic because it helps the patient place his or her problem in the proper perspective. If the physician determines that deeper psychotherapy sessions are required, he or she can transition the patient out of the emergency setting and into an appropriate clinic or center.|$|E
2500|$|Since the 1960s {{the demand}} for {{emergency}} psychiatric services has endured a rapid growth due to deinstitutionalization both in Europe and the United States. Deinstitutionalization, in some locations, {{has resulted in a}} larger number of severely mentally ill people living in the community. [...] There have been increases in the number of medical specialties, and the multiplication of transitory treatment options, such as psychiatric medication. The actual number of psychiatric emergencies has also increased significantly, especially in psychiatric emergency <b>service</b> <b>settings</b> located in urban areas. Emergency psychiatry has involved the evaluation and [...] treatment of unemployed, homeless and other disenfranchised populations. Emergency psychiatry services sometimes can be accessibility, convenience, and anonymous. While many of the patients who used psychiatric emergency services shared common sociological and demographic characteristics, the symptoms and needs expressed did not conform to any single psychiatric profile. The individualized care needed for patients utilizing psychiatric emergency services is evolving, requiring an always changing and sometimes complex treatment approach.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the growing}} body of {{literature}} on different employee behaviors such as organizational citizenship behavior or boundary spanning behavior, few research studies have investigated the impact of both in-role and extra-role behavior on performance outcomes, especially in business <b>services</b> <b>settings.</b> In this study we investigate how in-role behavior, extra-role behavior, and their interrelation influences employee performed productivity and quality in business security services. Data from 1, 174 frontline service employees is analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results indicate that performance quality is directly influenced by in-role employee behavior oriented towards customers, while performance productivity is influenced by both in-role and extra-role employee behavior oriented towards employees and customers. Opportunities for future research and managerial implications of the results are discussed. ...|$|R
2500|$|Job {{performance}} is another consistent and important outcome of core-self evaluations. [...] Many theories have developed regarding how the CSE trait {{is related to}} job performance; {{the most popular of}} these theories argues that people with high core self-evaluations will be more motivated to perform well because they are confident they have the ability to do so. [...] Another theory suggests that the link between core self-evaluations and performance can be attributed to supervisors enjoying the positivity of high CSE individuals and, thus, rating them highly on performance measures. [...] Lastly, literature has argued that high CSE could be an ability factor. [...] This last theory stems from intuitions made about core self-evaluations from previous connections found in literature. [...] For example, literature has connected the construct of positive self-concept, an idea similar to core self-evaluations, to the ability to cope well with organizational change. [...] Furthermore, individual core self-evaluation traits like emotional stability have been linked to job performance in team settings (Mount, Barrick, & Stewart, 1995 as cited in). [...] Finally, it is suggested that those with a positive self-concept will be likely to perform well in customer <b>service</b> <b>settings</b> due to their positive emotional displays. [...] These findings support the possibility that high core self-evaluations could indicate a person who has the ability to cope well with organizational change, to work well in groups, and to display positive emotions, all of which contribute to better performance.|$|E
2500|$|Byrd's staunch {{adherence}} to Catholicism {{did not prevent}} him from contributing memorably to the repertory of Anglican church music. Byrd's small output of church anthems ranges in style from relatively sober early examples (O Lord, make thy servant Elizabeth our queen (a6) and How long shall mine enemies (a5) [...] ) to other, evidently late works such as Sing joyfully (a6) which is close in style to the English motets of Byrd's 1611 set, discussed below. Byrd {{also played a role}} in the emergence of the new verse anthem, which seems to have evolved in part from the practice of adding vocal refrains to consort songs. Byrd's four Anglican <b>service</b> <b>settings</b> range in style from the unpretentious Short Service, already discussed, to the magnificent so-called Great Service, a grandiose work which continues a tradition of opulent settings by Richard Farrant, William Mundy and Robert Parsons. Byrd's setting is on a massive scale, requiring five-part Decani and Cantoris groupings in antiphony, block homophony and five, six and eight-part counterpoint with verse (solo) sections for added variety. This service setting, which includes an organ part, must have been sung by the Chapel Royal Choir on major liturgical occasions in the early seventeenth century, though its limited circulation suggests that many other cathedral choirs must have found it beyond them. Nevertheless, the source material shows that it was sung in York Minster as well as Durham, Worcester and Cambridge, in the early seventeenth century.. The Great Service was in existence by 1606 (the last copying date entered in the [...] so-called Baldwin Commonplace Book) and may date back as far as the 1590s. Kerry McCarthy has pointed out that the York Minster manuscript of the Great Service was copied by a vicar-choral named John Todd, apparently between 1597–99, and is described as 'Mr Byrd's new sute of service for means'. [...] This suggests the possibility that the work may have been Byrd's next compositional project after the three Mass settings.|$|E
