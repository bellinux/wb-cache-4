5|$|By the 1980s, the 40-year-old Class 86 and Class 91 trains were {{in need of}} replacement. NSB {{described}} them as unable to satisfy demands in terms of economy, comfort or <b>speed.</b> <b>Class</b> 92 was bought to take over all passenger transport on the Røros Line and on the Nordland Line south of Grong. The 15 two-car units cost NOK200 million and were built by Duewag in Germany.|$|E

25|$|UHS-I and UHS-II cards can use UHS <b>Speed</b> <b>Class</b> rating {{with two}} {{possible}} grades: class 1 for minimum read/write performance {{of at least}} 10MB/s ('U1' symbol featuring number 1 inside 'U') and class 3 for minimum write performance of 30MB/s ('U3' symbol featuring 3 inside 'U'), targeted at recording 4K video. Before November 2013, the rating was branded UHS Speed Grade and contained grades 0 (no symbol) and 1 ('U1' symbol). Manufacturers can also display standard <b>speed</b> <b>class</b> symbols (C2, C4, C6, and C10) alongside, or in place of UHS <b>speed</b> <b>class.</b>|$|E

25|$|Also {{in early}} 2010, {{commercial}} SDXC cards appeared from Toshiba (64GB), Panasonic (64GB and 48GB), and SanDisk (64GB). In early 2011, Centon Electronics, Inc. (64GB and 128GB) and Lexar (128GB) began shipping SDXC cards rated at <b>Speed</b> <b>Class</b> 10. Pretec offered cards from 8GB to 128GB rated at <b>Speed</b> <b>Class</b> 16.|$|E
25|$|The rise to peak {{brightness}} {{may be very}} rapid, or gradual. This {{is related}} to the <b>speed</b> <b>class</b> of the nova; yet after the peak, the brightness declines steadily. The time taken for a nova to decay by around 2 or 3magnitudes from maximum optical brightness is used for classification, via its <b>speed</b> <b>class.</b> Fast novae typically will take fewer than 25days to decay by 2magnitudes, while slow novae will take more than 80days.|$|E
25|$|Video <b>Speed</b> <b>Class</b> {{defines a}} set of {{requirements}} for UHS cards to match the modern MLC NAND flash memory and supports progressive 4K and 8K video with minimum sequential writing speeds of 6-90MB/s. The graphical symbols use 'V' followed by a number designating write speed (V6, V10, V30, V60, and V90).|$|E

25|$|In April 2012, Panasonic {{introduced}} MicroP2 {{card format}} for professional video applications. The cards are essentially full-size SDHC or SDXC UHS-II cards, rated at UHS <b>Speed</b> <b>Class</b> U1. An adapter allows MicroP2 cards {{to work in}} current P2 card equipment. Panasonic MicroP2 cards shipped in March 2013 and were the first UHS-II compliant products on market; initial offer includes a 32GB SDHC card and a 64GB SDXC card.|$|E
2500|$|Speed classes 2, 4, and 6 {{assert that}} the card {{supports}} the respective number of megabytes per second as a minimum sustained write speed for a card in a fragmented state. Class 10 asserts that the card supports 10MB/s as a minimum non-fragmented sequential write speed and uses a High Speed bus mode. The host device can read a card's <b>speed</b> <b>class</b> and warn the user if the card reports a <b>speed</b> <b>class</b> that falls below an application's minimum need. By comparison, the older [...] "×" [...] rating measured maximum speed under ideal conditions, and was vague as to whether this was read speed or write speed. The graphical symbol for the <b>speed</b> <b>class</b> has a number encircled with 'C' (C2, C4, C6, and C10).|$|E
2500|$|The <b>speed</b> <b>class</b> rating {{does not}} totally {{characterize}} card performance. Different cards {{of the same}} class may vary considerably while meeting class specifications. A card's speed depends on many factors, including: ...|$|E

2500|$|With early SD cards, a few card {{manufacturers}} specified {{the speed}} as a [...] "times" [...] ("×") rating, which compared the average speed of reading data {{to that of}} the original CD-ROM drive. This was superseded by the <b>Speed</b> <b>Class</b> Rating, which guarantees a minimum rate at which data can be written to the card.|$|E

2500|$|On December 7, 1897, President Loomis of the IR {{handed over}} Ocean Wave to Capt. Charles Clancy, {{who was to}} take the steamer down the Columbia River and around the Olympic Peninsula to Puget Sound. [...] According to one non-contemporaneous source, the reason for the sale was that Ocean Wave was not in the same <b>speed</b> <b>class</b> as the primary competition, T.J. Potter.

2500|$|The SD Association defines {{standard}} <b>speed</b> <b>classes</b> for SDHC/SDXC cards indicating minimum performance (minimum {{serial data}} writing speed).

2500|$|The [...] "×" [...] rating, {{that was}} used by some card {{manufacturers}} and made obsolete by speed classes, is a multiple of the standard CD-ROM drive speed of 150KiB/s (approximately 1.23Mbit/s). Basic cards transfer data at up to six times (6×) the CD-ROM speed; that is, 900KiB/s or 7.37Mbit/s. The 2.0 specification defines speeds up to 200×, but is not as specific as Speed Classes are on how to measure speed. Manufacturers may report best-case speeds and may report the card's fastest read speed, which is typically faster than the write speed. Some vendors, including Transcend and Kingston, report their cards' write speed. When a card lists both a <b>speed</b> <b>class</b> and an [...] "×" [...] rating, the latter may be assumed a read speed only.|$|E
