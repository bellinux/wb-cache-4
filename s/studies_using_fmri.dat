50|$|Human brain <b>studies</b> <b>using</b> <b>FMRI</b> (Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging) revealed {{a network of}} regions in the inferior frontal cortex and inferior parietal cortex which are typically activated during imitation tasks.

50|$|A <b>study</b> <b>using</b> <b>fMRI</b> while {{subjects}} were asked to imagine precise visual figures, to mentally disassemble them, or mentally blend them, showed activity in the occipital, frontoparietal, posterior parietal, precuneus, and dorsolateral prefrontal regions of the subject's brains.|$|R
50|$|Current {{understanding}} of the localization of OR in the brain is still unclear. In one <b>study</b> <b>using</b> <b>fMRI</b> and SCR, researchers found novel visual stimuli associated with SCR responses typical of an OR also corresponded to activation in the hippocampus, anterior cingulate gyrus, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. These regions are also believed to be largely responsible for emotion, decision making, and memory. Increases in cerebellar and extrastriate cortex were also recorded, which are significantly implicated in visual perception and processing.|$|R

(Mormon)... devotional practice was reproducibly associated with activation in nucleus accumbens, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and frontal attentional regions. Nucleus accumbens activation preceded peak spiritual feelings by 1-3 s and was replicated in four separate tasks. ... The association of abstract ideas and brain reward circuitry may interact with frontal attentional and emotive salience processing, suggesting a mechanism whereby doctrinal concepts {{may come to}} be intrinsically rewarding and motivate behavior in religious individuals." ...|$|R
50|$|Emotion {{can also}} be {{embodied}} or perceived from words read on a page or a person’s facial expression. Neuroimaging <b>studies</b> <b>using</b> <b>fMRI</b> have demonstrated that the same {{area of the brain}} being activated when one is feeling disgust is also activated when one observes another person feeling disgust. In a traditional learning environment, the teacher's facial expression can {{play a critical role in}} students' language acquisition. Showing a fearful facial expression when reading passages that contain fearful tones facilitates students learning of the meaning of certain vocabulary words and comprehension of the passage.|$|E
50|$|A recent {{intracranial}} electrocorticography {{study shows}} that the activity in the VWFA goes through multiple stages of processing. Using classification with direct neural recordings from the VWFA, Hirshorn et al. showed that early VWFA activity, from approximately 100-250 milliseconds after reading a word, {{is consistent with a}} pre-lexical representation and later activity, from approximately 300-500 milliseconds is consistent with a lexical representation. These results potentially mediate between the pre-lexical and lexical hypotheses by showing that both levels of representation may be seen in the VWFA, but at different latencies after reading a word. Previous <b>studies</b> <b>using</b> <b>fMRI</b> did not have the temporal resolution to differentiate between these two stages.|$|E
5000|$|The {{biological}} {{foundation of}} the mind's eye is not fully understood. <b>Studies</b> <b>using</b> <b>fMRI</b> {{have shown that the}} lateral geniculate nucleus and the V1 area of the visual cortex are activated during mental imagery tasks. Ratey writes:The visual pathway is not a one-way street. Higher areas of the brain can also send visual input back to neurons in lower areas of the visual cortex. ... As humans, {{we have the ability to}} see with the mind's eye - to have a perceptual experience in the absence of visual input. For example, PET scans have shown that when subjects, seated in a room, imagine they are at their front door starting to walk either to the left or right, activation begins in the visual association cortex, the parietal cortex, and the prefrontal cortex - all higher cognitive processing centers of the brain.|$|E
50|$|Psychopathy {{is thought}} to be caused by normal {{processing}} of social and emotional cues, but abnormal use of these cues.One <b>study</b> <b>used</b> <b>fMRI</b> to look at the brain activity of youth with aggressive conduct disorder and socially normal youth when they observed empathy eliciting stimuli. The results showed that the aggressive conduct disorder group had activation in the amygdala and ventral striatum, which lead the researcher to believe that these subjects may get a rewarding feeling from viewing pain in others.|$|R

50|$|Some {{studies of}} aging and {{cognition}} focus on working memory processes and declines in attentional control. One <b>study</b> <b>used</b> <b>fMRI</b> measures during a Stroop task comparing neural activity of attentional control in younger (21-27 years) and older participants (60-75 years). Conditions included increased competition and increased conflict. Results showed evidence of decreases in responsiveness in brain areas associated with attentional control for the older group. This result suggests that older people may have decreases {{in their ability to}} utilize attentional control in their everyday lives.|$|R
5000|$|Neuroanatomical {{evidence}} from <b>studies</b> <b>using</b> <b>fMRI</b> scans of aesthetic preference show that representational paintings are preferred over abstract paintings. This is displayed through significant activation of brain regions related to preference ratings. [...] To test this, researchers had participants view paintings that varied according to type (representational vs. abstract) and format (original vs. altered vs. filtered). Behavioral results demonstrated {{a significantly higher}} preference for representational paintings. A positive correlation existed between preference ratings and response latency. FMRI results revealed that activity in the right caudate nucleus extending to putamen decreased in response to decreasing preference for paintings, while activity in the left cingulate sulcus, bilateral occipital gyri, bilateral fusiform gyri, right fusiform gyrus, and bilateral cerebellum increased in response to increasing preference for paintings. [...] The observed differences were a reflection of relatively increased activation associated with higher preference for representational paintings.|$|E
50|$|The {{ability to}} {{describe}} {{situations in which}} a social emotion will be experienced emerges at around age 7, and, by adolescence, the experience of social emotion permeates everyday social exchange. <b>Studies</b> <b>using</b> <b>fMRI</b> have found that different brain regions are involved in different age groups when performing social-cognitive and social-emotional tasks. While brain areas such as medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), superior temporal sulcus (STS), temporal poles (TP) and precuneus bordering with posterior cingulate cortex are activated in both adults and adolescents when they reason about intentionality of others, the medial PFC is more activated in adolescents and the right STS more in adults. Similar age effects were found with younger participants, such that, when participants perform tasks that involve theory of mind, increase in age is correlated {{with an increase in}} activation in the dorsal part of the MPFC and a decrease in the activity in the ventral part of the MPFC were observed.|$|E
5000|$|Functional neuroimaging {{studies using}} {{positron}} emission tomography (PET) and {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) have demonstrated significant differences between the brains of synesthetes and non-synesthetes (although some studies failed to find such differences). The first such study used PET to demonstrate that some regions of the visual cortex (but not V4) were more active when auditory word → color synesthetes listened to words compared to tones [...] More recent <b>studies</b> <b>using</b> <b>fMRI</b> have demonstrated that V4 is more active in both word → color and grapheme → color synesthetes ( [...] ; [...] ). However, these neuroimaging studies do not have the spatial and temporal resolution to distinguish between the pruning and disinhibited feedback theories. Future research will continue to examine these questions using not only fMRI but also diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which allows researchers to directly investigate neural connectivity in the human brain and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) which allows researchers to measure the amounts of different neurotransmitters in the brain.|$|E
5000|$|The {{activated}} {{brain regions}} in the person experiencing the pain firsthand included: contralateral sensorimotor cortex, bilateral secondary sensorimotor cortex, contralateral posterior insula, bilateral mid and anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex, right ventrolateral and mediodorsal thalamus, brainstem, and mid and right lateral cerebellum. [...] One <b>study</b> <b>used</b> <b>fMRI</b> to observe brain activity of an individual receiving unpredictable laser pain stimuli. This study showed that the primary and secondary sensorimotor cortex, posterior insula, and lateral thalamus are involved in processing aspects of nociceptive stimuli such as location and intensity.|$|R
5000|$|While {{working at}} the University of Montreal, Beauregard and his {{graduate}} student, Vincent Paquette, conducted a <b>study</b> <b>using</b> <b>fMRI</b> to examine the brains of nuns reliving mystical experiences. They {{found that there was}} no single spot involved in mediating these experiences, but that instead, multiple brain regions and systems were involved. He has also studied the brain activity of people who are reliving near-death experiences they have previously had. He has said that this research seems to indicate that these experiences have [...] "triggered something at a neural level in the brain." ...|$|R
50|$|Although {{numerous}} {{studies have shown that}} the two systems are independent and structured separately from another, there is also evidence that both are essential for successful perception, especially as the stimuli takes on more complex forms. For example, a case <b>study</b> <b>using</b> <b>fMRI</b> was done on shape and location. The first procedure consisted of location tasks. The second procedure was in a lit-room where participants were shown stimuli on a screen for 600 ms. They found that the two pathways play a role in shape perception even though location processing continues to lie within the dorsal stream.|$|R
5000|$|The {{advent of}} {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance imaging}} gave a new set of tools to neuroscience {{that could be used to}} investigate questions that were difficult or impossible to address previously. The first neuropolitics <b>studies</b> <b>using</b> <b>fMRI</b> looked at the differences in brain activity between people who were knowledgeable about national politics and those who were not, while they answered political questions. Following in the tradition of work by Philip Converse and John Zaller, it found that the politically knowledgeable had elevated levels of activity in the default mode network of the brain while political novices had diminished activity in the same areas. [...] A subsequent study by Drew Westen and colleagues confirmed the elevated default mode network activity for political sophisticates and suggested differences between Republicans and Democrats in how they think about political questions. [...] Westen later expanded on his findings and their implications for political campaigns in his book The Political Brain.|$|E
50|$|Other <b>studies</b> <b>using</b> <b>fMRI</b> (functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging) scanners {{have shown that}} when change is not consciously detected, {{there was a significant}} decrease in the dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal lobe regions. These results further the importance of the dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal cortext in the detection of visual change. In addition to fMRI studies, recent research has used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in order to inhibit areas of the brain while participants were instructed to try to detect the change between two images. The results show that when the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is inhibited, individuals are significantly slower at detecting change. The PPC is critical for encoding and maintaining visual images in short term working memory, which demonstrates the importance of the PPC in terms of detecting changes between images. For a change to be detected, the information of the first picture needs to be held in working memory and compared to the second picture. If the PPC is inhibited, the area of the brain responsible for encoding visual images will not function properly. The information will not be encoded and will not be held in working memory and compared to the second picture, thus inducing change blindness.|$|E

Similar patterns of brain activations were obtained in young literates during verbal and nonverbal tasks. In aged illiterates, however, both verbal and nonverbal tasks mainly engaged left hemispheric regions at locations different from those of aged literates.

30|$|Working memory, {{the ability}} to retain {{information}} {{for a short period}} of time [1], is regarded as a core cognitive function that underpins a wide range of complex behaviours such as problem solving, decision-making and reasoning.

40|$|Episodic {{memory is}} {{associated}} with the encoding and retrieval of context information and with a subjective sense of reexperiencing past events. The neural correlates of episodic retrieval have been extensively <b>studied</b> <b>using</b> <b>fMRI,</b> leading to the identification of a "general recollection network" including medial temporal, parietal, and prefrontal regions. However, in these studies, it is difficult to disentangle the effects of context retrieval from recollection. In this <b>study,</b> we <b>used</b> <b>fMRI</b> {{to determine the extent to}} which the recruitment of regions in the recollection network is contingent on context reinstatement. Participants were scanned during a cued recognition test for target words from encoded sentences. Studied target words were preceded by either a cue word studied in the same sentence (thus congruent with encoding context) or a cue word studied in a different sentence (thus incongruent with encoding context). Converging fMRI results from independently defined ROIs and whole-brain analysis showed regional specificity in the recollection network. Activity in hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex was specifically increased during successful retrieval following congruent context cues, whereas parietal and prefrontal components of the general recollection network were associated with confident retrieval irrespective of contextual congruency. Our findings implicate medial temporal regions in the retrieval of semantic context, contributing to, but dissociable from, recollective experience...|$|R
50|$|Another <b>study</b> <b>using</b> <b>fMRI</b> {{showed that}} {{the parts of the}} brain {{responding}} to puns and semantic-based jokes which participants found amusing were different. In response to puns, the left posterior middle temporal gyrus and the left inferior frontal gyrus were activated. When listening to semantic jokes, the left posterior middle temporal gyrus was again activated, and so were the left posterior inferior temporal gyrus, the right posterior middle temporal gyrus, and the cerebellum. Interestingly, brain activity in the medial ventral prefrontal cortex was associated with ratings of funniness which the participants gave after the brain scan and initial humor response. This response may be stemming from the mood or emotional change which occurs after hearing humor.|$|R
40|$|In early retinotopic {{areas of}} the human visual system, {{information}} from {{the left and right}} visual hemifields (VHFs) is processed contralaterally in two hemispheres.

How exactly the visual system integrates information from the two VHFs and achieves this perceptual experience still remains largely unknown. In this <b>study</b> <b>using</b> <b>fMRI,</b> we explored candidate areas that are involved in interhemispheric integration and the perceptual experience of a unified, global motion across VHFs.
