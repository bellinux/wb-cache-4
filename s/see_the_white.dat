25|$|In {{addition}} to Brown, Stephanie Athey and Daniel Cooper Alarcon also examine {{the influence of}} women throughout the novel. In their text, Oroonoko's Gendered Economies of Honor/Horror: Reframing Colonial Discourse Studies in the Americas, Athey and Alarcon state that {{to better understand the}} novel, the reader should “first <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> and black women who mediate the exchange between male antagonists". Furthermore, they illustrate Imoinda’s strength because she “fights at Oroonoko’s side, while other slave wives urge their men to surrender”.|$|E
2500|$|As a {{poet and}} mythographer, Graves claimed a {{historical}} basis for the triple-goddess, and an ongoing tradition of her worship among poets. Although Graves's work is widely discounted by academics as pseudohistory [...] (<b>see</b> <b>The</b> <b>White</b> Goddess § Criticism and The Greek Myths § Reception), it continues to have a lasting influence on many areas of Neopaganism.|$|E

[...] After graduation, Warner attended Harvard Law School, where he coached the school's first intramural women's basketball team and received his Juris Doctor in 1980.

2500|$|Terlincthun British Cemetery {{is located}} {{high on the}} cliffs of Boulogne, from which it is {{sometimes}} possible to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> cliffs of the English coast. A fleet of French and British warships awaited the King to escort him home, but first, joined by Queen Mary, he visited the graves of the British war dead. Along with Haig (representing the Army), the royal couple were joined by Earl Beatty (representing the Navy), and General de Castelnau (representing the French Army), along with other dignitaries, including the cemetery architect Sir Herbert Baker. After visiting the graves, the King laid a [...] at the Cross of Sacrifice, and together with a guard of honour of French soldiers saluted the dead to begin a two-minute silence. Following this, the King, facing the Stone of Remembrance, delivered an eloquent and moving speech composed by Kipling, which made reference to the nearby column commemorating Napoleon Bonaparte.|$|E
2500|$|... “When I saw {{the great}} White Chief I {{thought he was}} a great man. [...] When I heard him speak, then I felt sure he was a great man. [...] But the White Chief is not as the big men in out tribes. [...] He wore no plumes and no decorations. [...] He had none of his young men (warriors) with him, and only that I heard him talk he would have been to me as other white men. [...] But my brother Mr. Gladstone came to see me in my lodge as a friend, and I was glad to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Chief, for though my tongue was tied in his {{presence}} my heart was in full friendship. [...] After he went away they told me that half of his great nation of white men have adopted him as their chief. [...] If he were not both good and wise, so many young men of his nation would have never taken him for their leader.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Furthermore, purists {{were not}} {{fond of the}} way certain {{characters}} were portrayed in the pilot. For instance, Kitty Pryde was seen in their eyes as coming across as {{too much of a}} whiny damsel-in-distress (although this may have been intended to be the start of her character arc, eventually evolving into a stronger, more mature heroine). Fans also found it confusing to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Queen be portrayed {{as a member of the}} Brotherhood of Mutants. This Brotherhood was a mix of Magneto's group (with the inclusion of Toad) and Mystique's (with the inclusion of Pyro and the Blob) along with the previously unaffiliated Juggernaut and White Queen. Most importantly, fans were upset at the sound of the traditionally Canadian Wolverine, speaking with an Australian accent. This casting error seemed to stem from a brief run-through of the script in which, mockingly, Wolverine calls the traditionally Australian character Pyro, a dingo. In the final version, however, Wolverine calls Toad a [...] "dingo" [...] rather than Pyro.|$|E
2500|$|On October 19, {{the defense}} called the two {{surgeons}} {{who tried to}} revive Selena at the hospital. The defense questioned why Quintanilla, Jr. would request that a blood transfusion not to be performed on Selena due to his religious beliefs, when by law, Pérez would have the final say {{whether or not the}} procedure would be performed. The autopsy pictures of Selena were displayed for everyone to <b>see.</b> <b>The</b> <b>white</b> American jury member was affected by the pictures, and was seen [...] "bursting into tears" [...] as Lloyd White described his findings in detail. According to Arrarás, Saldívar was seen as [...] "impassive"; she had [...] "lowered her head" [...] when the autopsy pictures were shown. After confirming that Selena was not pregnant, contradicting rumors in media reports, White announced his conclusion: [...] "this was a homicide, not an accident." [...] The prosecution called on a firearms expert who found the gun to be in working condition and stating that a person pulling the trigger must use a [...] "great amount of pressure". Valdez showed pictures of the motel room where Selena had been shot, indicating that: [...] "it was impossible for [...] not know her friend had been wounded." [...] Valdez said: [...] "this meant that she had not come to [...] aid because she chose not to." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{came to know}} Ann {{first as}} a moviegoer. I’d walk into various movie theaters and <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> hair up above the stadium seating. That’s how you'd know she was there. People {{do all kinds of}} things to get noticed in politics, but Ann wasn't there for anyone but Ann. She was someone who loved the movies, loved the tactile {{experience}} of being in the movie theater, loved talking about movies, loved meeting filmmakers– I think she was more excited to meet filmmakers than foreign dignitaries. At the Texas Film Hall of Fame, she was as much a celebrity at that event as anyone honored. People paid money to see her as much as anyone else there. She would often ride down to Austin on the New York plane with the celebrities being honored. One year it was with Ethan Hawke. All she wanted to talk about, at the pre-party, was that [...] "Ethan Hawke is so cute." [...] She loved him. This was not something that could be faked. She was starstruck. She loved these guys … (Watching a clip from Terrence Malick’s [...] "Days of Heaven" [...] at a Hall of Fame ceremony), she is mesmerized by this image. I mean, her eyes are glued to that screen. Again {{this is not something that}} you can fake. And she looked at me and she said [...] "I love the movies" [...] with this childlike voice, this passion. Standing next to me at that moment was not the former governor, a political swordsman... she was like all the rest of us, just someone who loved the movies. It’s a terrible loss for Texas in so many ways, but for the cultural community to have an advocate in that position, you don’t have that but once a generation, if you’re lucky."– ...|$|E
