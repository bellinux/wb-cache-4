5|$|The {{subway station}} at Porter is, at 105 feet below ground level, the deepest in the MBTA system. Porter's unusual depth {{is due to}} the MBTA's {{decision}} to build the station in bedrock rather than soft clay, saving time and money in the construction process. Passengers reach Red Line platforms via a series of escalators, stairs totalling 199 steps, or a set of elevators. The longest <b>single</b> <b>span</b> of the escalators is 143feet, the longest in the MBTA system. In 2005, a man was killed when his sweatshirt tangled {{in the bottom of the}} escalator.|$|E
5|$|The West Cornwall Covered Bridge (an earlier {{incarnation}} {{was known}} as the Hart Bridge) is a wooden covered lattice truss bridge carrying the Sharon-Goshen Turnpike over the Housatonic River in the town of Cornwall, Connecticut. Records indicate that a bridge may have been in place in this location as early as 1762. A previous bridge was destroyed in the flood of 1837 and a new bridge was constructed in 1841. This bridge would also be destroyed and the current bridge would be completed circa 1864. Utilizing the central pier from the previous incarnation, despite the Town lattice being able to withstand the weight and <b>single</b> <b>span,</b> the bridge has two spans. The later addition of queen trusses and supports gives the bridge an unusual appearance. Modernization of the bridge in 1968 and 1973 has continued to let the bridge handle traffic. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.|$|E
25|$|After Stoney Creek Bridge {{the line}} {{proceeds}} north-east {{along the northern}} side of the Stoney Creek Gorge, over two timber trestle bridges at 23.39km and 23.78km, plus a <b>single</b> <b>span</b> timber bridge at 23.89km and a <b>single</b> <b>span</b> steel bridge at 24.54km, before entering Tunnel 14 at 24.69km (curve left, 85m). Glacier Rock looms {{to the north of}} the line at this point. The line then passes the site of The Springs Station before cutting alongside The Red Bluff and entering the Barron Gorge. There is a <b>single</b> <b>span</b> steel bridge at 25.49km, and a modern footbridge over the line (Douglas Track) before two timber trestle bridges at 25. km and 25.95km. By this point the line has turned to the north-west.|$|E

25|$|A18 road also crosses both branches. The {{bridge over}} the new branch was {{designed}} by John Rennie and built in 1827, with brick flanks and ashlar masonry. The bridge was widened in the 20th century, with the south face being reused once the widening had taken place. The road formerly crossed the old branch at County Bridge, a <b>single</b> <b>span</b> rusticated stone arch erected in 1828. The handrails were replaced in 1951, and the A18 was diverted over a new bridge to the north.|$|E
25|$|Travelling west {{along the}} {{southern}} side of the Stoney Creek Gorge, at 20.72km {{there is a second}} steel lattice girder bridge (Bridge 23), with timber trestles on the approaches and two concrete piers, which is followed by two timber trestle bridges (the first also has one concrete pier) prior to Tunnel 10 at 21.06km (straight then curve left, 119m). Tunnel 11 is at 21.30km (curve left, 83m), and is followed by two very small <b>single</b> <b>span</b> steel bridges over concrete drains at 21.58km and 21.60km. Kelly?s Leap follows, where a modern rock fall barrier has been erected near an early open concrete drain. These are followed by timber trestle bridges at 21.76km and 21.92km, and then Tunnel 12 at 22.04km (curve right then straight, 81m). There is a timber trestle bridge at 22.18km, followed by Tunnel 13 at 22.47km (straight then curve left, 88m).|$|E
25|$|Latest {{engineering}} studies of 'the Gap' {{have produced a}} design for a single-track link (difficult to justify the additional cost for double-track) - previously proposing to utilize two, ex-Network Rail, single-track bridges (removed {{as part of the}} Reading Station upgrade), now to be utilized to bridge the Preci-Spark Car Park and Railway Terrace. The latest design proposes to re-instate the bridge over the Midland Main Line utilizing a new-build <b>single</b> <b>span</b> bridge, complying with electrification clearances for the recently announced electrification project. This will cost significantly more than the original proposal, but has the benefits of reduced future maintenance and access charges for the previously proposed central pillar. The additional cost is somewhat offset by the use of the 'Reading Bridges' at the locations mentioned. The replacement embankments {{to the north of the}} Canal bridge are proposed to use the latest construction techniques to provide a higher but narrower structure. Funding options are currently being reviewed for what may be the 'Greatest Heritage Railway Project' in the UK.|$|E

25|$|The towpath crosses {{from the}} west bank to the east bank at the bridge. A little further to the east is the Old Tollgate Bridge, a red brick <b>single</b> <b>span</b> with ashlar {{dressing}} dating from the late 1700s, which crosses the Old River Ancholme. Continuing northwards, the towpath crosses the entrance to the Caistor Canal, disused since 1877. A 20th century steel span is supported by stone abutments, built around 1785, when the canal opened. The bridge is Grade II listed as is the adjacent first lock, one of five that remain on the Caistor Canal. Hibaldstow Bridge was rebuilt in 1889 to a design by Alfred Atkinson, and the wrought-iron span, which rests on brick piers, was supplied by a company of ironfounders called Messrs Porter and Co of Lincoln. It replaced an earlier wooden swing bridge, dating from Rennie's reconstruction, and the piers from that bridge were probably reused. Atkinson was also responsible for Cadney Bridge, rebuilt in 1882, for which the wrought iron span was supplied by Messrs Goodwin, Jardine and Co of Glasgow. Again, the piers from an earlier bridge were probably reused.|$|E
25|$|From Redlynch Station, {{the railway}} line heads south past Jungara to Horseshoe Bend, before heading {{north along the}} eastern side of the Lamb Range and turning west into Stoney Creek Gorge. Between Redlynch and Stoney Creek Station there are 13 tunnels and 16 bridges. The first bridge (deck type) is located at a {{distance}} of 12.06km from Cairns. It uses timber girders on timber trestles (some trestle piles and headstocks have already been replaced with steel); this is the form used by the majority of timber bridges on the section, although some use single-span timber girders between concrete abutments. A second timber bridge, with a concrete pier, exists at 13.05km. The site of Jungara Station is passed at 13.82km, with a timber trestle bridge at 14.77km, just before Horseshoe Bend, a 5 chain curve with a large earth embankment. There are two more timber trestle bridges at 15.31km and 16.55km, plus a <b>single</b> <b>span</b> timber girder bridge between concrete abutments at 16.95km, before reaching the first tunnel at 17.12km. Tunnel 1 is concrete lined (as are all the tunnels), straight and 66m long. Tunnel 2, located at 18.42km, is straight with a left curve at the uphill end and 76m long; while Tunnel 3 is at 19.11km (curve left, then straight, 109m).|$|E
