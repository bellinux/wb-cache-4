40|$|Abstract: The {{sensitivity}} of differential-pressure flow meters {{to the quality}} of the approaching flow continues to be a cause for concern to flowmeter manufacturers and users. Distortions to the approaching velocity profiles generated by pipe fittings and installations located upstream of a flowmeter, can lead to considerable errors in flowmetering. This cannot be ignored because of the likely cost and process efficiency implications. This paper describes the effects of various entrance flow velocity profiles on the performance of an orifice flowmeter with and without flow conditioning. Asymmetric swirling velocity profiles were generated by a ball valve. These caused significant shifts to the meterâ€™s calibration. The use of a vaned-plate flow conditioner, consisting of six vanes attached to a 70 % porosity plate, greatly improved the performance of the meter. Thus, the device can be used as part of a flowmetering package that will have considerably reduced installation lengths. The less-sophisticated NEL plate proved to be a good flow straightened, i. e. a good <b>swirl</b> <b>remover,</b> but was not an efficient flow conditioner...|$|E

High structureborne noise levels may jeopardize passenger acceptance of the fuel-efficient high-speed propeller transport aircraft designed for cruise at Mach 0. 65 to 0. 85. These single-rotation tractor and counter-rotation tractor and pusher propulsion systems will consume 15 to 30 percent less fuel than advanced turbofan systems. Structureborne noise detection methodologies and the importance of development of a structureborne noise sensor are discussed. A structureborne noise generation mechanism is described in which the periodic components or propeller swirl produce periodic torques and forces on downstream wings and airfoils that are propagated to the cabin interior as noise. Three concepts for controlling structureborne noise are presented: (1) a stator row <b>swirl</b> <b>remover,</b> (2) selection of a proper combination of blade numbers in the rotor/stator system of a single-rotation propeller, and the rotor/rotor system of a counter-rotation propeller, and (3) a tuned mechanical absorber...|$|E
