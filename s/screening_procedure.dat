25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} widely {{discussed}} false positives in medical screening come from the breast cancer <b>screening</b> <b>procedure</b> mammography. The US rate of false positive mammograms is up to 15%, the highest in world. One consequence of the high false positive rate in the US is that, in any 10-year period, half of the American women screened receive a false positive mammogram. False positive mammograms are costly, with over $100million spent annually in the U.S. on follow-up testing and treatment. They also cause women unneeded anxiety. As {{a result of the}} high false positive rate in the US, as many as 90–95% of women who get a positive mammogram do not have the condition. The lowest rate in the world is in the Netherlands, 1%. The lowest rates are generally in Northern Europe where mammography films are read twice and a high threshold for additional testing is set (the high threshold decreases the power of the test).|$|E

40|$|The {{early years}} of {{childhood}} are critical for optimal development {{of a variety of}} skills. The accurate and efficient identification of potential delays in, or issues with child development, is essential in identifying those children most in need of early intervention services. <b>Screening</b> <b>procedures</b> are designed to identify children who appear at risk for these delays or issues, with the children then more completely and comprehensively evaluated. Unfortunately, <b>screening</b> <b>procedures</b> during the preschool years remain nonsystematic, inefficient, and/or prohibitively expensive.

Specific barriers to more widespread and systematic <b>screening</b> <b>procedures</b> include the nation’s increasing cultural and linguistic diversity, increasing socio-economic status diversity, limited access to such systematic sources of screening such as medical services and child care centers, and high costs of <b>screening</b> <b>procedures</b> administered by professionals.

25|$|The temple gained great {{popularity}} {{during the}} 1980s (during the Asian economic boom), {{especially among the}} growing well-educated and entrepreneurial middle class, mostly small-business owners and technocrats of Sino-Thai origin. Royalty and high-standing civil servants also started to visit the temple, including the generals Arthit Kamlang-ek and Chaovalit Yongchaiyuth. During this period the temple experienced tremendous growth in terms of monks, lay workers and temple visitors. The temple therefore established a <b>screening</b> <b>procedure</b> for newcomer employees. Furthermore, Mae chi Chandra set strict rules and regulations for the community, such as a prohibition on political lobbying and selling things in the temple. Wat Phra Dhammakaya emphasized values of prosperity, modernity and personal development, which made it attractive for the middle class, especially during times of quick cultural and social changes. By the mid-1980s, the temple was attracting up to fifty thousand people on major ceremonies. The Dhammadaya ordination program started out with sixty participants in 1979; by 1986, over a thousand participants joined. In 1990, the temple had 260 monks, 214 samaneras (novices that are minors) and 441 full-time employees. In 1995, Wat Phra Dhammakaya caught the nation's attention when a Magha Puja celebration was broadcast live on television, with the then Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn {{as chairman of the}} ceremony.|$|E
25|$|Beta {{thalassemia}} is a {{hereditary disease}} {{allowing for a}} preventative treatment by carrier screening and prenatal diagnosis. It can be prevented if one parent has normal genes, giving rise to screenings that empower carriers to select partners with normal hemoglobin. A study aimed at detecting the genes that could give rise to offspring with sickle cell disease. Patients diagnosed with beta thalassemia have MCH ≤ 26 pg and an RDW < 19. Of 10,148 patients, 1,739 patients had a hemoglobin phenotype and RDW consistent with beta thalassemia. After the narrowing of patients, the HbA2 levels were tested presenting 77 patients with beta thalassemia. This <b>screening</b> <b>procedure</b> proved insensitive in populations of West African ancestry because of the indicators has high prevalence of alpha thalassemia. Countries have programs distributing information about the reproductive risks associated with carriers of haemoglobinopathies. Thalassemia carrier screening programs have educational programs in schools, armed forces, and through mass media {{as well as providing}} counseling to carriers and carrier couples. Screening has showed reduced incidence; by 1995 the prevalence in Italy reduced from 1:250 to 1:4000, and a 95% decrease in that region. The decrease in incidence has benefitted those affected with thalassemia, as the demand for blood has decreased, therefore improving the supply of treatment.|$|E
25|$|Screening by {{hysteroscopy}} {{to obtain}} cell samples obtained for histological examination is being developed. This {{is similar to}} the current pap smear that is used to detect cervical cancer. The UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening is testing a screening technique that combines CA-125 blood tests with transvaginal ultrasound. Other studies suggest that this <b>screening</b> <b>procedure</b> may be effective. However, it's not yet clear if this approach could actually help to save lives—the full results of the trial will be published in 2015. One major problem with screening is no clear progression of the disease from stage I (noninvasive) to stage III (invasive) is seen, and it may not be possible to find cancers before they reach stage III. Another problem is that screening methods tend to find too many suspicious lesions, most of which are not cancer, but malignancy can only be assessed with surgery. The ROCA method combined with transvaginal ultrasonography is being researched in high-risk women to determine if it is a viable screening method. It is also being investigated in normal-risk women as it has shown promise in the wider population. Studies are also in progress to determine if screening helps detect cancer earlier in people with BRCA mutations.|$|E

As screening {{has the potential to}} be resource intensive, effort has been placed on the development of efficient <b>screening</b> <b>procedures,</b> namely brief behavior rating scales. This study utilized classical test theory and generalizability theory to examine the extent to which differences among students, raters, occasions, and screening measures affect the meaningfulness of data derived from universal <b>screening</b> <b>procedures.</b> Teacher pairs from three middle school classrooms completed two brief behavior rating scales during fall and spring screening administrations for all students in their respective classrooms. Correlation coefficients examining interrater reliability, test-retest reliability, and concurrent validity were generally strong. Generalizability analyses indicated that the majority of variance in teacher ratings were attributable to student differences across all score comparisons, but differences between teacher ratings for particular students accounted for relatively large percentages of error variance among student behavior ratings. Although decision studies showed that increasing the number of screening occasions resulted in more generalizable data, the impact of increasing the number of raters resulted in more efficient <b>screening</b> <b>procedures...</b>|$|R

25|$|Newborn {{screening}}: Newborn screening is used {{just after}} birth to identify genetic disorders {{that can be}} treated early in life. A blood sample is collected with a heel prick from the newborn 24–48 hours after birth {{and sent to the}} lab for analysis. In the United States, newborn <b>screening</b> <b>procedure</b> varies state by state, but all states by law test for at least 21 disorders. If abnormal results are obtained, it does not necessarily mean the child has the disorder. Diagnostic tests must follow the initial screening to confirm the disease. The routine testing of infants for certain disorders is the most widespread use of genetic testing—millions of babies are tested each year in the United States. All states currently test infants for phenylketonuria (a genetic disorder that causes mental illness if left untreated) and congenital hypothyroidism (a disorder of the thyroid gland). People with PKU do not have an enzyme needed to process the amino acid phenylalanine, which is responsible for normal growth in kids and normal protein use throughout their lifetime. If there is a buildup of too much phenylalanine, brain tissue can be damaged, causing developmental delay. Newborn screening can detect the presence of PKU, allowing kids to get put on a special diet right away to avoid the effects of the disorder.|$|E
