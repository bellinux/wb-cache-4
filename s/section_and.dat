5|$|Most of the overtures are {{in three}} sections: a lively introduction, a slow middle <b>section,</b> <b>and</b> a {{concluding}} allegro in sonata form, with two subjects, a brief development, a recapitulation and a coda. However, Sullivan himself {{did not always}} follow this pattern. The overture to Princess Ida, for instance, has only an opening fast <b>section</b> <b>and</b> a concluding slow section. The overture to Utopia Limited is dominated by a slow section, with only a very brief original passage introducing it.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Identification {{of small}} {{electrical}} appliances via power consumption requires accurate detection {{and evaluation of}} steady-state <b>sections</b> <b>and</b> transient <b>sections.</b> However, the steady-state <b>sections</b> <b>and</b> transient <b>sections</b> are extracted from low frequency sampled (1 Hz) power measurements. We gain the steady-state <b>sections</b> <b>and</b> transient <b>sections</b> by processing real and reactive power measurements with a robust bucketing technique and unsupervised clustering. Macroscopic features for detected steady-state <b>sections</b> <b>and</b> transient <b>sections</b> are then extracted. Besides, our method estimates the similarity of steady-state <b>sections</b> <b>and</b> transient <b>sections</b> <b>and</b> determines recurred <b>sections</b> accurately. The proposed method is applicable for an inexpensive, unsupervised learning of small electrical appliances in real time...|$|R

5|$|The HPOTP turbine and HPOTP {{pumps are}} {{mounted on a}} common shaft. Mixing of the fuel-rich hot gases in the turbine <b>section</b> <b>and</b> the liquid oxygen in the main pump can create a hazard and, to prevent this, the two {{sections}} are separated by a cavity that is continuously purged by the engine's helium supply during engine operation. Two seals minimize leakage into the cavity; one seal is located between the turbine <b>section</b> <b>and</b> the cavity, while the other is between the pump <b>section</b> <b>and</b> cavity. Loss of helium pressure in this cavity results in automatic engine shutdown.|$|E

5|$|After a {{company-wide}} {{contest to}} name the aircraft, the initial prototype received the name Pirate and made its first flight on 2 October 1946.

The vertical stabilizer also had to be redesigned to smooth out the airflow {{at the intersection of}} the horizontal and vertical stabilizers. Other changes included the addition of dive brakes {{on the sides of the}} fuselage and the replacement of the Metalite panels near the engine's exhaust with stainless steel ones.|$|E
