She can take it to Donald Rumsfeld, but she cannot take it across the street to an article3 court.|$|E

In discussion of this, she said, [...] "That C-word thing actually did happen. I was furious, and I had this weird reaction where I kept saying, 'You can't <b>say</b> <b>that!</b> <b>My</b> parents love me!'" [...] In another interview, she was asked whether the c-word was based on experience, to which she said, [...] "It {{was a little bit}}. It was a little bit based on the experience of having someone call you that and not knowing how to deal with it.". [...] In December 2015 Fey revealed that the writer who called her [...] "the c word" [...] was Colin Quinn.|$|E

That I'm sure of. ... It wouldn't be what it is, and I imagine it wouldn't be so good; putting it as modestly as I can, it wouldn't be what it is if I'd been born in England, and it wouldn't be what it is if I'd stayed in America. It's a combination of things. But in its sources, in its emotional springs, it comes from America." ...|$|E

2500|$|After this {{somewhat}} strained but greatly productive discussion concerning arms, {{the negotiations}} between the two delegations became more general, with Ford admitting the challenge posed by economic difficulties in the United States and Brezhnev explaining that some members of his Politburo did not think détente was a prudent strategy, whom he knew would be highly critical of him if he made too many concessions to the Americans. Then, somewhat to Ford's surprise, Brezhnev began talking in considerable detail about the United States Congress, which the Soviets {{had come to see}} as potentially detrimental to their ability to negotiate with American presidents. Trying to plan for the future, Brezhnev asked Ford, [...] "What kind of a Congress will you be dealing with for the next two years?", to which Ford replied, [...] "Mr. General Secretary...I can only <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> fingers are crossed." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, Smithsonian Folkways Recordings, having {{acquired}} Folkways Records in 1986, reissued {{the collection}} on six compact discs, each disc corresponding to each {{album of the}} original set on vinyl, including replicas of Smith's original artwork and liner booklet. An additional booklet included expanded track information for each song by Jeff Place, excerpts from Invisible Republic by Greil Marcus, essays by Jon Pankake, Luis Kemnitzer, Moses Asch, and Neil Rosenberg, and tributes and appreciations by John Fahey, John Cohen, Elvis Costello, Peter Stampfel, Luc Sante, Dave Van Ronk, Eric Von Schmidt, Chuck Pirtle, and Allen Ginsberg. The back cover to this booklet closes with a quote by Smith: [...] "I'm glad to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> dreams came true. I saw America changed through music." [...] At the 40th Grammy Awards, the reissue won awards for Best Album Notes and Best Historical Album.|$|E
2500|$|The Reverend Leonard Jenyns, {{a naturalist}} Darwin had known since {{his time at}} the University of Cambridge, had at Darwin's request contributed the volume on Fish in Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle, and was now {{working on a book}} of notes on {{observations}} of plants and animals. On 12 October Darwin wrote to tell him that [...] "work on the species question has impressed me very forcibly with the importance of all such works, as your intended one, containing what people are pleased generally to call trifling facts. These are the facts, which make one understand the working or œconomy of nature.... namely what are the checks & what the periods of life, by which the increase of any given species is limited." [...] He told Jenyns that he had [...] "continued steadily reading & collecting facts on variation of domestic animals & plants & on the question of what are species; I have a grand body of facts & I think I can draw some sound conclusions. The general conclusion at which I have slowly been driven from a directly opposite conviction is that species are mutable & that allied species are co-descendants of common stocks. I know how much I open myself, to reproach, for such a conclusion, but I have at least honestly & deliberately come to it. I shall not publish on this subject for several years." [...] In November he thanked Jenyns for sending a detailed note, and told him [...] "With respect to my far-distant work on species, I must have expressed myself with singular inaccuracy, if I led you to suppose that I meant to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> conclusions were inevitable. They have become so, after years of weighing puzzles, to myself alone;; but in my wildest day-dream, I never expect more than to be able to show that there are two sides {{to the question of the}} immutability of species, ie whether species are directly created, or by intermediate laws, (as with the life & death of individuals)." [...] He outlined the events that had led him to these ideas, and while cautious about [...] "numerous immense difficulties on my notions" [...] told him that he had [...] "drawn up a sketch & had it copied (in 200 pages) of my conclusions; & if I thought at some future time, that you would think it worth reading, I shd. of course be most thankful to have the criticism of so competent a critic." [...] Jenyns never took up this offer to read the [...] "Essay", but did advise Darwin on possible issues with the term [...] "mutation". Darwin replied [...] "it will be years before I publish, so that I shall have plenty of time to think of better words".|$|E

40|$|People {{identify}} powerfully with music: {{someone might}} <b>say</b> <b>thats</b> <b>my</b> song! {{but they are}} unlikely to <b>say</b> <b>thats</b> <b>my</b> book! or <b>thats</b> <b>my</b> picture! A digital library of popular music therefore {{has the potential to be}} a compelling application of information retrieval technology. Such a library requires a retrieval method that is appropriate for a non-technical audience. Experiments on query by humming, which attempt to retrieve a tune based on sampled recording of a user singing an excerpt, have heretofore concentrated on relatively small, well-curated collections. Scaling up introduces three problems: availability of source material, an increase in false positive hits, and slower retrieval. We describe our experiments with MIDI files, propose a new, more accurate distance metric between queries and songs, and discuss possibilities for efficient indexing. 1. # INTRODUCTION Digital libraries until now could hardly be described as popular: they tend to be based on esoteric, scholarly sources close [...] ...|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> adversary next <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> 'savages are of {{the nineteenth}} century.' It {{is of the essence}} of <b>my</b> theory <b>that</b> <b>my</b> savages are of many {{different}} centuries. Those described by Herodotus, Strabo, Dio Cassius, Christoval de Moluna, Sahagun, Cieza de Leon, Brebeuf, Garoilasso de la Vega, Lafitau, Nicholas Damascenus, Leo Africanus, and a hundred others, are not of the nineteenth century. This fact is essential, because the evidence of old writers, from Herodotus to Egede, corroborates the evidence of travellers, Indian Civil Servants, and missionaries of today, by what Dr. Tylor, when defending our materials, calls 'the test of recurrence.' Professor Millar used the same argument in his Origin of Rank, in the last century. Thus Mr. Max Muller unconsciously misrepresents me (and my savages) when he <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> 'savages {{are of the}} nineteenth century.' The fact is the reverse. They are of many centuries. These two unconscious misrepresentations occur in four consecutive lines.|$|R
