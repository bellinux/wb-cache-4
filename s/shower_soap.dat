The chiggers may be dislodged, but you will still have the stylostomes, causing the severe itch. Scratching deep to remove stylostomes can cause secondary infections. For temporary relief of itching, apply ointments of benzocaine, hydrocortisone, calamine lotion, New Skin, After Bite, or others recommended by your pharmacist or medical doctor. Some use Vaseline, cold cream, baby oil, or fingernail polish. (The sooner the treatment, the better the results.)....|$|R

40|$|National {{guidelines}} do {{not support}} preoperative body washing to reduce surgical site infections, instead recommending bathing or <b>showering</b> with <b>soap.</b> Yet preoperative body washing continues to be widely used in many hospitals across Europe. This paper suggests that existing trials of preoperative body washing, upon which guidelines are based, are dated and proposes a new investigation of preoperative body washing using modern definitions of surgical site infection with standardised patient follow up, modern surgical techniques and well designed trials. This paper provides a critique of existing guidelines and describes a randomised trial with 60 participants to compare the effect of soap and two antiseptic washing products on colony forming units (CFUs) {{for up to six}} hours. Chlorhexidine gluconate and octenidine were significantly more effective than soap in reducing CFUs in the underarm, and chlorhexidine was significantly more effective than soap in reducing CFUs in the groin. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} focused on the problem of utilization of bees products in cosmetics. The aim of this thesis was to elaborate a literature review focused on individual bee products, their properties and their utilization in cosmetics. Honey, beeswax, propolis, pollen, royal jelly, apisin are said to be the bee products. Properties, utilization, determination of kvalitative properties and aplication into cosmetic products of individual bee products are mentioned in this thesis. Beeswax is used in production of lipsticks, creams and for basis of smears (oily creams). Royal jelly is aplicated into lotions, face masks, lipsticks, night creams, hair waters, hydration preparations etc. Honey is used for preparation of <b>shower</b> gels, <b>soaps,</b> body milks, hydration creams. Propolis is added into creams, body milks, body lotions, shampoos, lipsticks, soaps and mouth sprays. Pollen has significant content of vitamins, aminoacids and other substances in nature form for cosmetics. These substances are important for nutrition, regeneration and hydration of skin. Apisin is used in pharmacologic preparations, like healing creams and smears...|$|R
30|$|The {{ingredient}} {{lists of}} rinse-off products (shampoo, <b>soap,</b> <b>shower</b> gel) and leave-on products (creams and deodorants) were analyzed separately {{and led to}} the following results: Rinse-off products contained on average 6.2 natural substances (on average 1.8 were not the correct INCI names), whereas leave-on products contained on average eight natural substances per product, (four of which were not the correct INCI names). There is no relevant difference between the number of alcohol containing rinse-off products and leave-on products. The differences of the compositions between all rinse-off and all leave-on products are smaller than the differences between companies. The compositions of products within each product type showed a substantial variability, concerning the presence of ethanol, glycerol and ‘parfum’.|$|R

5000|$|On Day 8, Housemates learned {{they would}} have a total of five {{nomination}} points, to divide between two women. It was revealed later that night that Charne had received the most votes, with Estelle and Layla behind her. These were the three nominees for the week. Housemates were also given their weekly task this day called the Road Trip Task. They would have to complete a 3627 kilometre trip in a motorbike and side-car. Success will give housemates a luxury food budget. That afternoon while Michael is cleaning the fish tank, he hears a voice (Big Brother) who claims to be Surly, the fish in the tank. Surly gives Michael the task of hugging each housemate within 10 minutes, without them realising something is going on. Michael completes the task, returns to the bathroom, and Surly tells Michael to go into the Bedroom and [...] "find the multi-coloured spiral ornament on the back wall. Grab hold of it and turn it slowly, a quarter turn to the right to be precise". Michael follows the instructions and inside is the Secret Executive Bathroom.

40|$|A {{microgravity}} {{whole body}} shower (WBS) and waste water recovery systems (WWRS) were evaluated in three separate closed loop tests. Following a protocol {{similar to that}} anticipated for the U. S. Space Station, test subjects showered in a prototype whole body shower. The WWRS processes evaluated during the test series were phase change and reverse osmosis (RO). A preprototype Thermoelectric Integrated Hollow Fiber Membrane Evaporation Subsystem phase change process {{was used for the}} initial test with chemical pretreatment of the shower water waste input. The second and third tests concentrated on RO technologies. The second test evaluated a dynamic RO membrane consisting of zirconium oxide polyacrylic acid (ZOPA) membranes deposited on the interior diameter of 316 L porous stainless steel tubes while the final test employed a thin semipermeable RO membrane deposited on the interior surface of polysulfone hollow fibers. All reclaimed water was post-treated for purity using ion exchange and granular activated carbon beds immediately followed by microbial control treatment using both heat and iodine. The test hardware, controls exercised for whole body <b>showering,</b> types of <b>soaps</b> evaluated, <b>shower</b> subject response to reclaimed water showering, and shower water collection and chemical pretreatment (if required) for microbial control are described. The WWRS recovered water performance and the effectiveness of the reclaimed water post-treatment techniques used for maintaining water purity and microorganism control are compared.

50|$|Upon {{entering}} the sauna complex one undresses in the shared dressing room {{and takes a}} warm <b>shower</b> with <b>soap.</b> After this <b>shower</b> one takes a warm foot bath for several minutes to acclimate the body to a warmer temperature by warming the blood. One sits on or wears a towel while doing this. When the body is well enough warmed, one enters the actual sauna and chooses a bench to sit or lie on. Less experienced sauna users will often take the lower benches to avoid the highest temperatures. One puts a towel under oneself and leaves the body uncovered. Wearing flip-flops, a towel or bathrobe is not allowed in the sauna itself. A saunameester might perform an opgieting on various times during the day. Visitors usually won't perform an opgieting by themselves and just sit or lay in the sauna when a saunameester is not available. A sauna session takes about 15-20 minutes. The door {{is expected to be}} closed as soon as possible when entering or leaving the sauna. Once an opgieting has started it is frowned upon to enter the sauna, since it will cause a reduction of heat when opening the door. Leaving the sauna during an opgieting is acceptable if to avoid becoming unwell. The drinking of water is not done in the sauna to prevent the available blood from flowing to the abdomen rather than to the head, which increases the chance of losing ones consciousness by vasodilation. After the sauna one will take a few minutes to walk in the outdoor area or cold / snow room to cool down somewhat. Sometimes small portions of fruit will be offered. After a few minutes outside the sauna one will submerse oneself in the cold bath or take a cold shower bath. When cooled down sufficient one usual uses the relax area to sleep or otherwise relax during which one may choose to wear a towel or bathrobe. Outside the actual sauna or steam room it is always acceptable to wear a bathrobe or towel and flip-flops. This ritual may be repeated several times during the day, starting with the warm showering each time, followed by the foot bath, actual sauna, cooling down and relaxing. A full sauna cycle takes at least 45-60 minutes. After each cycle one might also use the hot bath, salt scrub, massage facilities, swimming pool or bar and dining facilities. Before doing this, showers are also the norm.|$|R
30|$|The {{classification}} and labelling {{of personal}} care products was derived by application of the criteria given in the CLP Regulation. Bridging principles were not relevant as no information about comparable cosmetic products tested and classified as mixtures was available. 41 cosmetic products were selected {{from a wide range}} of product groups (e.g. [27, 28]): baby skin product (2), after shave (2), shaving cream, deodorant (4), toothpaste (2), shampoo (2), hand and body lotion, <b>shower</b> gel, liquid <b>soap</b> and syndet, eye zone cream, massage oil, carotene skincare gel, all purpose cream, basic cream, hand cream, emulsion with panthenol, massage oil, hair spray (2), oxidative hair dye formula, bleaching lotion, depilatory cream, cold wave solution, mascara (2), lipstick (2), face make up remover, nail glue, perfume, alcohol free cologne, insect repellent (2). The number of ingredients ranged from 41 (perfume) to a single one (nail glue). The formulas are basic recipes for standard products and correspond to lists of ingredients of products in German retail shops and cosmetic frame formulations [8]. The present selection of products is meant to illustrate the situation with some examples and it is not meant to be complete nor representative. The information on properties necessary for {{classification and labelling}} of all ingredients were compiled from data accessible to the general public. Preferentially harmonized classifications were used in the current C&L Inventory [9]. The classifications of substances registered according to REACH were compared with the classifications in the C&L Inventory. Most substances which are used more or less exclusively in cosmetics have not been registered according to REACH, whereas cosmetic ingredients used also in other applications like e.g. glycerol, hydrogen peroxide, isododecane, isopropanol, or phosphoric acid are registered. The recently installed cosmetic products notification portal according to the Cosmetics Regulation 1223 / 2009 [6] is not open for the general public and could not be used. The names used here are the INCI names [29].|$|R
