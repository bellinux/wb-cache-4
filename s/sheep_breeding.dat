5|$|Largely as {{a result}} of the {{influence}} of humans in <b>sheep</b> <b>breeding,</b> ewes often produce multiple lambs. This increase in the lamb births, both in number and birth weight, may cause problems in delivery and lamb survival, requiring the intervention of shepherds.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, the United States Department of the Interior {{created the}} Southwestern Range and <b>Sheep</b> <b>Breeding</b> Laboratory {{to address the}} {{problems}} Rambouillet stock had caused for the Navajo economy. Located at Fort Wingate, New Mexico, the program's aim was to develop a new sheep bloodline that simulated the wool characteristics of the 19th-century Navajo-Churro stock and would also supply adequate meat. The Fort Wingate researchers collected old Navajo-Churro stock from remote parts of the reservation and hired a weaver to test their experimental wool. Offspring of these experiments were distributed among the Navajo people. World War II interrupted the greater part of this effort when military work resumed at Fort Wingate.|$|E

5|$|In these {{countries}} {{there is little}} need, and no option but for ewes to lamb outdoors as there are insufficient structures to handle the large flocks of ewes there. New Zealand ewes produce 36 million lambs each spring time, which is an average of 2,250 lambs per farm. Australian graziers, too, do not receive the financial support that governments in other countries provide to sheep breeders. Low-cost <b>sheep</b> <b>breeding</b> is based on large numbers of sheep per labour unit and having ewes {{that are capable of}} unsupervised lambing to produce hardy, active lambs.|$|E
5|$|Ovine {{obstetrics}} can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing; balancing ease of lambing with high productivity {{is one of}} the dilemmas of <b>sheep</b> <b>breeding.</b> In the case of any such problems, those present at lambing may assist the ewe by extracting or repositioning lambs. After the birth, ewes ideally break the amniotic sac (if it is not broken during labor), and begin licking clean the lamb. Most lambs will begin standing within an hour of birth. In normal situations, lambs nurse after standing, receiving vital colostrum milk. Lambs that either fail to nurse or are rejected by the ewe require help to survive, such as bottle-feeding or fostering by another ewe.|$|E
5|$|Ovine {{obstetrics}} can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing. However, it {{is a myth}} that sheep cannot lamb without human assistance; many ewes give birth directly in pasture without aid. This can be proven {{by the fact that}} they give birth in the wild. Balancing ease of lambing with high productivity is one of the dilemmas of <b>sheep</b> <b>breeding.</b> While the majority of births are relatively normal and do not require intervention, many complications may arise. A lamb may present in the normal fashion (with both legs and head forward), but may simply be too large to slide out of the birth canal. This often happens when large rams are crossed with diminutive ewes (this is related to breed, rams are naturally larger than ewes by comparison). Lambs may also present themselves with one shoulder to the side, completely backward, or with only some of their limbs protruding. Lambs may also be spontaneously aborted or stillborn. Reproductive failure is a common consequence of infections such as toxoplasmosis and foot-and-mouth disease. Some types of abortion in sheep are preventable by vaccinations against these infections.|$|E

25|$|The {{presence}} of Corsican expatriates {{in the vicinity}} of Rome is attested since at least the 9th century, when a small Corsican colony existed in Porto near Fiumicino during the pontificate of Pope Leo IV (r. 847–55); the existence of a Corsican nunnery along the Appian Way is known from the same period. In more recent times, Corsican emigration to Rome slowly began {{after the end of the}} Avignon papacy during the 15th century, at which point the city again offered job opportunities to immigrants. Previously, the traditional emigration areas of the Corsicans, pushed to leave their country by the poverty and anarchy reigning in Corsica during the Middle Ages, had been Liguria and Pisa, but during the 15th century Corsicans began to settle in Sienese and Latial Maremma, and from there in Rome. Initially, they were living scattered about in the city's rioni. However, at the onset of 16th century, they were concentrated on Tiber Island and in the part of Trastevere lying between the harbour of Ripa Grande and the church of San Crisogono. The center of their community was the now disappeared Piazza dell'Olmo ("Elm square"). San Crisogono became the national church and cemetery basilica of the Corsican nation in Rome, and over the centuries was used as the burial place of several Corsican military officers. Originally, the Corsicans were only able to find humble jobs in the city and its surroundings, mostly in the areas of <b>sheep</b> <b>breeding</b> and wine trading (the island's wines were much sought after during that period). The only exceptions to the aforementioned trades included becoming a priest, a servant in the Vatican palaces, or a soldier in the employ of the Pope or the Roman baroni; consequently, they did not become well integrated into Roman society.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to natural insemination by rams, artificial insemination and embryo transfers {{have been used}} in <b>sheep</b> <b>breeding</b> programs for many years in Australia and New Zealand. These programs have become more commonplace in the United States during the 2000s as the number of veterinarians qualified to perform these types of procedures with proficiency have grown. However, ovine AI is a relatively complicated procedure compared to other livestock. Unlike cattle or goats, which have straight cervices that can be vaginally inseminated, ewes have a curved cervix which is more difficult to access. Additionally, breeders were until recently unable to control their ewe's estrus cycles. The ability to control the estrus cycle is much easier today because of products that safely assist in aligning heat cycles. [...] Some examples of products are PG600, CIDRs, Estrumate and Folltropin V. [...] These products contain progesterone which will bring on the induction of estrus in ewes (sheep) during seasonal anestrus. Seasonal anestrus is when ewes do not have regular estrous cycles outside the natural breeding season.|$|E

40|$|Taenia multiceps (Leske, 1780) is a taeniid cestode {{that in its}} adult stage {{lives in}} the small {{intestine}} of dogs and other canids. The metacestode, previously known as Coenurus cerebralis, is usually found in the nervous system including brain and spinal cord in sheep and other ruminants. The presence of cysts typically leads to neurological symptoms that {{in the majority of}} cases result in the death of the animal from starvation after some weeks. Coenurosis could cause high losses in sheep farms because the disease affects young animals that the farmers grow up each year as replacements of the older individuals. Coenurosis is also a zoonosis with more than 100 human cases described in literature, of which the last in Italy and almost 5 reported in Sardinia. In the last years, the popularity of coenurosis has increased in <b>sheep</b> <b>breedings</b> because of the necessity to operate a differential diagnosis from another neurological disease, scrapie, particularly in atypical cases of coenurosis that could occur also in adult (2 - 3 years of age) sheep...|$|R

500|$|Historically {{the region}} has been a centre of Bulgarian culture. Strandzha is {{inhabited}} by three ethnographic groups— the Ruptsi, Tronki and Zagortsi. The Strandzhan or Eastern Ruptsi (called this way to distinguish them from the Rhodopean Ruptsi) are considered {{the largest of the}} three groups. The etymology of the name is linked to the word ropa or rupa, which means a [...] "mine shaft" [...] in the local dialects. They have preserved some vestiges of the pagan religious traditions and rites of the Antiquity. They speak the Strandzha dialect {{which is part of the}} Rup dialects and has preserved many words from the Old Bulgarian language. The traditional Ruptsi settlements in the park are Balgari, Brashlyan, Byala Voda, Gramatikovo, Kalovo, Kondolovo, Malko Tarnovo, Rezovo, Slivarovo, Stoilovo, Vizitsa, Zabernovo and Zvezdets. After 1913 the Ruptsi who inhabited the territory of modern Turkey settled in the north-western regions of Strandzha. Their main occupation was livestock breeding, and especially <b>sheep</b> <b>breeding,</b> logging, charcoal production and mining. The second largest group are the Tronki who inhabit mainly the areas to the north and to the west of the park in Sredets Municipality. They made a living mainly in agriculture but also in sheep and cattle breeding. The Zagortsi inhabit the regions to the north of the park and are thought to have migrated from north-eastern Bulgaria.|$|E
2500|$|Cattle {{ranching}} {{is another}} traditional branch of Nakhchivan farming. Due {{to the dry}} climate, pastures in Nakhchivan are unproductive, therefore <b>sheep</b> <b>breeding</b> prevails over other livestock production. Winter pastures stretch on the PriAraz plain, on the foothills and mountain sides to the altitude of 1200m. But the summer pastures go up on the high-mountain area to an altitude of 2300–3200m. The most widespread sheep variety is [...] "balbas". These sheep are distinguished by their productivity and snow-white silky wool which is widely used {{in the manufacture of}} carpets. Horned and small cattle are bred everywhere, especially in environs of Sharur and Nakhchivan. Buffaloes are also bred here.|$|E

2500|$|Two of Eliza Furlong's (sometimes spelt Forlong or Forlonge) {{children}} {{had died from}} consumption, and {{she was determined to}} protect her surviving two sons by living in a warm climate and finding them outdoor occupations. Her husband John, a Scottish businessman, had noticed wool from the Electorate of Saxony sold for much higher prices than wools from NSW. The family decided on sheep farming in Australia for their new business. In 1826, Eliza walked over [...] through villages in Saxony and Prussia, selecting fine Saxon Merino sheep. Her sons, Andrew and William, studied <b>sheep</b> <b>breeding</b> and wool classing. The selected 100 sheep were driven (herded) to Hamburg and shipped to Hull. Thence, Eliza and her two sons walked them to Scotland for shipment to Australia. In Scotland, the new Australia Company, which was established in Britain, bought the first shipment, so Eliza repeated the journey twice more. Each time, she gathered a flock for her sons. The sons were sent to NSW, but were persuaded to stop in Tasmania with the sheep, where Eliza and her husband joined them.|$|E

All groups sheeps were feeding with the same amount of food, but the ratio structure was different, in the following scheme conformities: group I - has been used a fibrous ratio; group II – has been used a juicy ratio; group III – has been used a concentrate ratio. Also, in all the groups was recorded the milk production and the weight of lambs in the first month of the life. Based on research conducted, the fallowing conclusions were drawn: The highest milk production was produced by sheeps in group I and group II; The weight of lambs in the first month of life was also influenced by the mother sheeps ratio structure; The largest increase growth was made of lambs coming from a group III, and the smallest increase was made of lambs coming a group II. As a general conclusion, the best results are obtained when the mother sheeps are fed with concentrate ratio type and fibrous ratio type...|$|R
