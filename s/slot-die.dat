The impact of temperature, solar irradiation and humidity on the adhesion and cohesion properties of this particular interface is discussed.

Annealing changes the morphology in the photoactive layer and consequently alters the chemical properties at the interface. Second, solar irradiation on fully encapsulated solar cells has no damaging but in contrast an enhancing effect on the adhesion properties, due to the heat generated from IR radiation. Finally, the synergetic effect of stress and an environmental species like moisture greatly accelerates the decohesion rate in the weak hygroscopic PEDOT:PSS layer.

In all cases, we observed adhesive failure at the interface between the P 3 HT:PCBM with PEDOT:PSS layer. The adhesion energy measured for the solar cells made on glass substrates was about 1. 8 J/m 2, but only 0. 5 J/m 2 for the roll-to-roll processed flexible solar cells.

Compared to solution processed PEDOT:PSS, we found that thermally evaporated MoO 3 adheres less to the P 3 HT:PCBM layer, which we attributed to the reduced mixing at the MoO 3 /P 3 HT:PCBM interface during the thermal evaporation process.

Furthermore, flexibility {{has become one of the}} essential properties of transparent electrodes, accounting for the rapidly changing trend in electronics. These problems can be overcome by AgNW-based films suitable for flexible and stable conductive electrodes by using wet-coating-processable material and roll-to-roll coating. In this work, we developed an effective method to fabricate a highly conductive, transparent, and stable AgNW/PEDOT:PSS film using roll-to-roll <b>slot-die</b> coating. This coating technique provides higher line speed and greater coating uniformity. Furthermore, the optimized AgNW/PEDOT:PSS solution allows direct one-step coating without any post-treatment, such as high-temperature annealing, mechanical pressure, and solvent washing.

40|$|An optimal {{nanoscale}} {{phase separation}} between the donor (generally, a conjugated polymer) and the acceptor (generally, a fullerene derivative) materials {{is one of the}} major requirements for obtaining high efficiency organic photovoltaic (OPV) device. Recent methods of controlling such nanostructure morphology in a bulkheterojunction (BHJ) OPV device involve addition of a small amount of solvent additive to the donor and acceptor solutions. The idea is to retain the acceptor materials into the solution for a longer period of time during the film solidification process, thus allowing the donor material to crystallize earlier. The ultimate morphology resulting from the solvent casting process of such multicomponent active layers involves a complex interplay of interactions between polymer/solvent, polymer/additive, fullerene/solvent, fullerene/additive, polymer/fullerene, and solvent/additive. In addition, multiple kinetic processes occur including solvent evaporation, phase separation, as well as polymer crystallization that lead to the final morphology of the active layer. Disentangling these different contributions is the key for optimization of the active layer morphology, and has been a primary emphasis of this dissertation. Accordingly, the major focus of this dissertation is twofold: to understand the parameters and interactions of solvent additives that govern the morphology evolution process of different low band-gap polymer/fullerene systems, as well as developing a laboratory-scale <b>slot-die</b> coating methodology, which not only mimics the large area roll-to-roll device fabrication process, but also plays an integral part on investigating the morphology evolution process of the polymer/fullerene blends.

30|$|The {{motivation}} {{behind the}} development of emerging photovoltaic thin-film solar cells, such as polymer, perovskite, and quantum-dot solar cells, is their potential to be fabricated using solution-processed molecular semiconductor materials and vacuum-free scalable casting methods. Among casting methods, spin coating is widely used, but its application is limited to lab-scale and batch processes. Dip coating and doctor blading are other lab-scale casting methods, which are less controllable. Organic solar modules have been fabricated in pilot scale {{using a combination of}} some of the scalable methods [1, 2]. A scalable casting technique should be ideally, fast, low-cost in terms of solar cell materials and energy consumption, roll-to-roll fabrication compatible, touch-free, automated, controllable, and suitable to coat small areas in an array of cells. The major potentially scalable casting techniques currently under investigation for the fabrication of emerging solar cells include the inkjet printing [3], <b>slot-die</b> casting [4], screen printing [5], gravure printing [6], spray coating [7, 8], etc. Each of the above-mentioned scalable techniques is usually suitable for the fabrication of films with particular characteristics. For instance, inkjet printing can direct small droplets to the target to make dots, lines and thin films. It is, however, a rather low-throughput process, given that the features are fabricated based on impingement and coalescence of many individual small droplets. <b>Slot-die</b> casting method is not suitable for the fabrication of nano-thin films, given that a rather large amount of solution is delivered during the deposition process, making the films thick. And while spray coating is a fast and scalable technique, it generally suffers from unsteadiness, inadequate film uniformity and intactness [8, 9]. Photovoltaic thin-film solar cells or modules are usually made of an array of small cells which are interconnected in series and parallel to achieve the required voltage and current [1, 2]. The size of each cell should be kept small to achieve a higher device performance and efficiency, given that large-area thin films are more susceptible to manufacturing defects and imperfections compared to small-area films. Therefore, masks may be required to be used during the spray deposition and other casting processes to ensure that only specific areas are covered, resulting in wastage of solar cell materials. To improve the uniformity of spray-on films, we have recently developed, implemented, and tested a modified coating technique, termed as substrate vibration-assisted spray-coating (SVASC), in which during the spraying process, controlled ultrasonic vibration is imposed on the substrate [10 – 12]. The imparted mechanical energy to the wet film leads to improvement in its uniformity as well its nano-structure and functionality. The imposed substrate vibration is also applicable to other casting methods, and has been used by others as well, such as for the fabrication of transistors [13] and nanowires [14]. It has been shown theoretically [15, 16] and experimentally [11, 12] that the imposed substrate vibration can improve or deteriorate surface wetting, depending on the amplitude, power and frequency of the imposed vibration. In the following sections, a manufacturing technique is proposed for the large scale fabrication of solar cell arrays that demonstrates continuous fabrication of solar cell layers on a solar cell module using drop casting combined with imposed substrate vibration, in a method herein termed as substrate vibration-assisted drop casting (SVADC).|$|E

However, up to date, {{the vast majority of}} solar cell reports have been based on spin-cast BHJ layers. Spin coating is not compatible with high speed and scalable coating processes, such as blade-coating and <b>slot-die</b> coating, which require the nanoscale morphology to be reproduced in scalable coating methods. And tolerance for thicker BHJ films would also facilitate high speed scalable coating. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, we investigate how pre-aggregating the conjugated polymer in solution impacts the charge transport in polymer films. We use P 3 HT in a wide range of molecular weights in different solvents of common use in organic electronics to investigate how they impact the aggregation behavior in the ink and in the solid state. By deliberately disentangling polymer chains via sonication of the solution in the presence of solvophobic driving forces, we show a remarkable ability to tune aggregation, which directly impacts charge transport, as measured in the context of field effect transistors. The second part of this thesis looks at the impact of the solution-coating method and the photovoltaic performance gap when applying modern BHJ inks developed for spin coating to scalable coating methods, namely blade coating. We ascribe this to significant differences in the drying kinetics between the processes. Emulating the drying kinetics of spin-coating was found to result in performance parity as well as morphological parity across several systems, resulting in demonstration of PTB 7 :PC 71 BM solar cells with efficiency of 9...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Large area organic {{photovoltaic}} (OPV) modules {{are gaining}} {{a lot of}} interest due to their potential for low cost electricity generation. Modules are typically fabricated from organic polymeric solutions using reel-to-reel (R 2 R) techniques such as <b>slot-die</b> coating. Control of the nanoscale morphology of the polymeric solutions during deposition has so far proven difficult. Here, we present a novel method for fabricating the active layer of OPV modules using colloidal suspensions of polymer nanoparticles. The nanoscale morphology of the active layer can be directly controlled using the nanoparticulate approach. We have shown that through careful control of the surface energy of the films produced, multiple layer films can be constructed. Multiple layer films are important because previous work in the literature using single layer nanoparticle films has shown very poor device performance. Multilayer nanoparticulate devices were constructed using nanoparticles containing blends of PFB:F 8 BT. The devices were constructed with both aluminium and calcium/aluminium electrodes and showed a large improvement in efficiency as compared to previous work. Interestingly these nanoparticulate devices were twice as efficient as the highest known bulk heterojunction devices. As OPV cells increase in size series resistance can limit module performance. The origin of the series resistance in OPV cells is probed and the area dependent resistances are identified. The contribution to the series resistance from the aluminium cathode is shown to be significant in some cases and can detrimentally affect device performance. A novel coating technique for the formation of the films used in OPV modules is described. The relationship between coating velocity and film thickness is shown to control the coating process. Proof-of-concept OPV modules have been produced, showing great promise for the efficient production of large area OPV modules. This work illuminates a pathway for constructing highly efficient, large area modules from aqueous dispersions that promise to fulfil the potential of organic photovoltiacs...|$|E
40|$|An {{interconnected}} network of silver nanowires {{has been used}} as transparent anode in OLED devices. This layer was deposited by spin-coating and <b>slot-die</b> coating from an aqueous nanowire suspension. The sheet resistance of the film was 10 ohms/sq with a transmission (including the glass substrate) of higher than 85 %. The first phase of the project focused on the implementation of this nanowire layer with a hole-injection-layer (HIL) which has been developed at Plextronics and has been shown to provide good stability and efficiency in conventional OLED devices. We modified the HIL solution such that it coated reasonably well with suitable surface morphology so that actual devices can be manufactured. During the second phase we investigated the hole-injection and stability of hole-onlydevices. We determined that the use of the nanowire network as anode does not introduce an additional degradation mechanism since the observed device characteristics did not differ from those made with ITO anode. We then proceeded to make actual OLED devices with this nanowire / HIL stack and achieved device characteristics similar state-of-the-art OLED devices with a single junction. In order to gain traction with potential OLED manufacturers, we decided to contract Novaled to prepare large-area demonstrators for us. For these devices, we used an allevaporated stack, i. e. we did use Novaledâs HIL material instead of Plextronicsâ. We successfully fabricated demonstrators with an area of 25 cm 2 with a double or triple junction stack. Minor stack optimizations were necessary to achieve efficacies and lifetime equivalent with ITO devices made with the same devices stack. Due to the reduced microcavity effect, the color of the emitted light is significantly more stable with respect to the viewing angle compared to ITO devices. This fact in conjunction with the promise of lower production cost due to the elimination of the ITO sputtering process and the direct patterning of the anode layer are the obvious advantages of this technology. The project has shown that this nanowire technology is a viable option to achieve OLED devices with good lifetime and efficiency and we are currently working with manufacturers to utilize this technology in a production setting...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of conducting polymers in 1977 the field of organic electronics has evolved rapidly. Displays based on {{organic light emitting diodes}} have already reached the consumer market and are produced in millions per month for applications as mobile phones. The development of organic solar cells and integrated circuits is still steadily increasing. One of the great benefits of these ‘plastic’ electronic materials is that they can be processed from solution. This enables cheap and fast production of electronic devices using roll-to-roll based technology, similar as the production of newspapers. Deposition technologies as <b>slot-die</b> coating and ink jet printing enable the production organic electronic devices on unconventional substrates, such as flexible plastic foils and paper. Another great benefit is the possibility of tailoring the polymers through carefully controlled synthesis, resulting in a multitude of different functionalities. Since {{the discovery}} of electroluminescence in conjugated polymers in 1990 it has been recognized that charge transport is a key ingredient for the efficiency of the polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs). The active part of PLEDs usually consists of only a single layer. In such a device holes are injected from the anode and electrons from the cathode into the polymer layer. The use of only a single electrooptic layer has a large fundamental disadvantage: due to the reduced electron transport in conjugated polymers most of the light in a PLED is generated close to the metallic cathode. This metallic cathode acts as a quenching site for the generated excitons, thereby strongly reducing the efficiency of the PLEDs. In order to strongly increase the efficiency of PLEDs multilayer stuctures have to be developed, comparable to the heterojunction based LEDs and laser diodes in inorganic III-V semiconductors. In such an optimized device electrons and holes are efficiently transported via high mobility layers towards a highly luminescent layer. The energy levels of the polymers used will be designed {{in such a way that}} the hole transport layer also serves as a blocking layer for electron transport and vice versa. Using a heterostructure electrons and holes can not leave the device without recombining, leading to an enhanced efficiency. A major problem why polymer based multilayer devices have not been realized so far is the solubility of the materials used; a multilayer can not be fabricated when a spin casted layer dissolves in the solvent of the subsequent layer. In this thesis charge transport layers with compatible solubility are developed and electrically characterized. ...|$|E
