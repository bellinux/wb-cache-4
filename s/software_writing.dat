Jagodzinski became an online pioneer at 21 years of age with the launch of the first e-commerce company. He is the founder of the first German Internet book retailer Telebooks (Telebuch), which he and his partner Michael Gleissner sold to Amazon.com along with its subsidiaries in 1998 for an undisclosed amount. Jagodzinski took on a position with Amazon as a director of European business development before selling his shares of the company, estimated at $55 million.|$|E
50|$|Thanks to Demon Systems, Demon Internet {{always had}} a strong {{programming}} team allowing it to create solutions to emerging issues in-house. All three directors were programmers and Stanford wrote many business-critical pieces of <b>software,</b> <b>writing</b> modules to adapt MMDF to Demon's purposes. Mark Turner, originally one of Demon System's developers, wrote many of the accounts and operational systems. As Stanford was increasingly absorbed with corporate activities, Neil McRae eventually took over {{the work on the}} mail system. Oliver Smith moved from Systems to Internet to run and automate services for corporate customers. Later on, Peter Galbavy was brought in to develop solutions for interoperability issues and Ronald Khoo developed low-level networking solutions that allowed the company to run on free operating systems and PC-based hardware.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, {{there are}} cases where nybble was used {{for a group of}} bits greater than 4. In the Apple II {{microcomputer}} line, much of the disk drive control and group-coded recording was implemented in <b>software.</b> <b>Writing</b> data to a disk was done by converting 256-byte pages into sets of 5-bit (later, 6-bit) nibbles and loading disk data required the reverse. Moreover, 1982 documentation for the Integrated Woz Machine refers consistently to an [...] "8 bit nibble".The term byte once had the same ambiguity and meant a set of bits but not necessarily 8, hence the distinction of bytes and octets or of nibbles and quartets (or quadbits). Today, the terms 'byte' and 'nibble' almost always refer to 8-bit and 4-bit collections respectively and are very rarely used to express any other sizes.|$|E

The hardware of the device was described as [...] "practically flawless". Seifert also liked the new <b>software,</b> <b>writing</b> that [...] "Samsung is known less for polish and more for clumsiness.

However, he criticized the Bixby assistant, writing that [...] "in its current state, it doesnâ€™t do much at all", and also criticized the amount of duplicate apps. Regarding performance, he wrote that the S8 was [...] "fast and responsive, but so is virtually every other premium phone you can buy, and the S8 isnâ€™t noticeably faster or quicker than a Google Pixel, LG G6, or iPhone 7". Fellow Verge reporter Vlad Savov felt that the placement of the fingerprint sensor was [...] "a perplexing decision if we consider it as a deliberate design choice", but noted reports from Korea claiming that Samsung had originally intended for the fingerprint reader to be built directly into the screen, but was unable to reach a desirable implementation in time for release.|$|E

50|$|The IBM DisplayWriter had a {{portrait}} monitor and keyboard with large backspace key, {{as it was}} designed for use in word processing instead of spreadsheets. Lanier, Wang, and CPT also made competing dedicated word processing computers with portrait modes. The height {{of the market for}} these computes was the late 1970s and early 1980s, prior to the introduction of the IBM PC. However, according to a long-time regional manager of the IBM personal computer division, speaking in confidence to the author of this entry in the mid-1980s, when the IBM PC was introduced, no portrait mode was made available for two reasons: (1) Top management didn't want the PC division to undermine the DisplayWriter product, (2) The computer was designed with spreadsheets and software development in mind, not word processing. Thus, it had a keyboard without a large backspace key at first, substituting a key widely used in computer <b>software</b> <b>writing.</b> Within a short period of time, the DisplayWriter and other dedicated word processors were no longer available. However, Portrait Display Labs leaped into this market niche, producing a number of rotating CRT monitors as well as software which {{could be used as a}} driver for many video cards. The later advent of the World Wide Web, whose pages are largely in portrait mode, failed to result in a widespread return to portrait displays. As of November 2011, for instance, HP no longer sells monitors in portrait mode, although they have a display stand which permits the user to attach two monitors and rotate either from landscape to display.|$|E
