40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the effects of a domestic parity program for wheat on Montana's wheat industry. The effects of two general types of domestic parity programs are analyzed. The first type treats all wheat as one commodity. The second type differs from the first one mainly in that it recognizes and provides for classes of wheat. In addition to the two main plans, two variations of the first and one variation of the second are also analyzed. The variations embody provisions for <b>surplus</b> <b>reduction</b> and the use of different time periods within which normal yield data necessary for quota calculations are determined. The total revenue accruing to the Montana wheat industry under each of the various plans and under the present wheat program is the main criterion by which they are compared.

In the case of the domestic parity plans, these revenue calculations are based on the various bushel quotas provided by them and on the 1949 - 1958 Montana average wheat and barley yields. Total revenue under the present program is based on the 1958 Montana wheat acreage allotment and on the 1949 - 1958 Montana average wheat and barley yields.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of {{renewable}} energy policies is to reduce CO 2 emissions by promoting the deployment of renewable technologies. Since the electricity sector emits more CO 2 than any other sectors, these policies will help promote the production of clean electricity. However, producing electricity from renewable energy sources is currently more expensive than conventional technologies, {{which means that the}} implementation of renewable policies would incur costs to the society. For this reason it is important to identify which renewable policy can be used to achieve CO 2 reductions at a least cost to the society. In this study, three main policies pertinent to electricity markets are analyzed. They are: renewable portfolio standard (RPS), feed in tariff (FIT), and cap and trade (CAT). First of all, by using an economic equilibrium model, the social surplus and CO 2 emissions from a perfectly-competitive electricity market are calculated. Then from the application of the different CO 2 reduction policies and their requirements, the amount of social <b>surplus</b> <b>reduction</b> per CO 2 ton avoided is obtained. Finally the cost to the society of avoiding CO 2 ton emissions are derived and analyzed. Such an analysis is to be further extended to consider the effects of endogenous learning on renewable technology development and to model endogenously the impacts (measured in dollar terms) from the increase of CO 2 emissions. ...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{concerns}} of the environmental scientists and policy makers {{is related to the}} environmental compatibility of current agricultural systems and, in particular, to the losses of chemical fertilizers and manure in surface and ground-waters, as a consequence of run-off and leaching phenomena. In most cases European recent agrienvironmental schemes envisaged specific measures for the reduction of fertilizer rates and the control of manure applications, in order to limit the releases of nutrients in surface and ground-waters. Substantial financial resources are invested in those measures and therefore the issue raises interest in monitoring and evaluating their effectiveness. Nutrient balance indicators are often used for quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of the measures in limiting the environmental impact of farming activities.

GAO's and the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) analysis show that the Fund had an economic value of $ 15. 8 billion (3. 20 percent) and $ 16. 6 billion (3. 66 percent), respectively. Given the economic value of the Fund and {{the state of the economy}} at the end of fiscal year 1999, a two-percent capital ratio appears sufficient to withstand moderately severe economic downturns that could lead to worse-than-expected loan performance. However, under more severe economic conditions, the economic value of two percent of insurance-in-force would not be adequate. Because of the uncertainty and professional judgment associated with this type of economic analysis, GAO cautions against relying on one estimate or even a group of estimates to determine the adequacy of the Fund's reserves over the longer term. HUD could exercise several options under current legislative authority to reduce the capital ratio for the Fund. It is difficult, however, to reliably measure the impact of policy changes on the Fund's capital ratio and Federal Housing Administration borrowers without using tools designed to estimate the multiple impacts that policy changes often have. Nonetheless, any option that reduces the Fund's reserve, if not accompanied by a similar reduction in other government spending, would result in a budget <b>surplus</b> <b>reduction</b> or a deficit increase. ...|$|R
40|$|Peat {{and heavy}} clay soils in the Netherlands are mainly used for {{permanent}} grassland to support dairy farming. As {{a result of}} intensification in dairy farming during the last decades, environmental quality is threatened by high emissions of N and P. Increased drainage of the wet soils has induced high mineralization rates, with associated losses of organic matter and nutrients. Improved utilization of N and P sources and new grazing and feeding strategies are proposed to reach environmental targets without loss of production. A sustainable prototype-system is designed by stepwise theoretical improvements of the current dairy farm. Although groundwater levels are kept high to limit breakdown of soil organic matter, the high availability of N and P from unavoidable peat mineralization offers the possibility to drastically reduce fertilizer inputs, which will directly reduce nutrient losses to the environment. Reduction of protein content in the ration reduces ammonia emission by approximately 20 °while milk production levels of 14, 000 kg ha-t per year can be maintained. The change from full to restricted grazing effectively reduces N losses from soil, but ammonia emission reductions are only significant with an improved slurry-application technique.

40|$|Introduction: The {{increasing}} {{emphasis of}} the CAP on environmental sensitive agricultural systems and <b>surplus</b> <b>reduction</b> has lead to an increased focus on organic farming and its consideration in policy measures. The EU project “Organic farming and the CAP” evaluates CAP and other policy measures {{with respect to their}} effect on organic farming in the EU. Therefore, the effects of various policy scenarios on the profitability of organic arable and dairy farms in selected EU countries were investigated. Material and Methods: Case studies of typical organic arable and dairy farms in DE, DK, UK and IT were conducted following the concept of the „International Farm Comparison Network (FAL) “ (Deblitz et al. 1998). In a group discussion process in panels of 4 - 8 farmers typical farms are defined and potential farm development strategies are discussed. Using the simulation model TIPI-CAL (Hemme et al. 1997) the economic development of these model farms is simulated for future years. Modelling results are corrected and confirmed by these panels in a three-stage feed back process, assuring high data quality. The impact of EU-wide policy scenarios on economic performance of these typical farms is demonstrated. A liberalisation scenario and two positive scenarios (one demand-driven, one policy-driven) are compared with a baseline scenario (Agenda 2000). Panels are confronted with these results and adoption of farm management strategies are discussed for the different policy scenarios. Results and Discussion: Size, structure, productivity, achieved output prices and policy surrounding of typical dairy and arable farms in differ widely among the selected countries. With respect to national differences especially productivity and the contribution of payments to total farm profit seem to be of importance. Farm family labour remuneration is highly variant not only among countries, but also between farm types within a country. Farm development strategies envisaged by organic farmers are related to diversification, value addition, and growth. Organic dairy farms tend to consider growth strategies more than organic arable farms do. However, diversification strategies are also important. Arable farms in turn are much more flexible and, therefore, more likely to diversify production and invest into valued adding strategies such as processing and marketing. The effects of policy scenarios on profitability of typical farms is similar in all countries. However, the choice of adoption strategy of farmers in the different countries vary significantly. This seems to be mainly due to the current national market situation. Conclusions: The present methodology benefits the consideration of non-monetary issues in the simulation process of farm strategy and policy modelling of farms. The effect of agricultural policy measures on organic farms can be demonstrated effectively, providing also a farmer based reasoning of farm development and adoption strategies...|$|R
