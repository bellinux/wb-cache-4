5|$|Imaging is {{indicated}} {{when there are}} red flags, ongoing neurological symptoms that do not resolve, or ongoing or worsening pain. In particular, early use of imaging (either MRI or CT) is recommended for suspected cancer, infection, or cauda equina syndrome. MRI is slightly better than CT for identifying disc disease; the two technologies are equally useful for diagnosing spinal stenosis. Only a few physical diagnostic tests are helpful. The straight leg raise test is almost always positive in those with disc herniation. Lumbar provocative discography {{may be useful to}} identify a specific disc causing pain in those with chronic high levels of low back pain. Similarly, therapeutic procedures such as nerve blocks can be used to determine a specific <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>pain.</b> Some evidence supports the use of facet joint injections, transforminal epidural injections and sacroilliac injections as diagnostic tests. Most other physical tests, such as evaluating for scoliosis, muscle weakness or wasting, and impaired reflexes, are of little use.|$|E
25|$|Duryodhana's {{hatred for}} the Pandavas stems from his sincere belief that he—being {{the son of}} the eldest brother—is the heir {{apparent}} to the throne of Hastinapura. Because of his blindness, his father had to renounce the throne in favor of the younger Pandu. Duryodhana deeply believed that what was rightfully his was being given away to his older cousin Yudhishthira. He also felt that the Pandavas were sons of Kunti and Gods (devakin), not of Pandu. He never believed that their divine origin alone proved their superiority, on many occasions questioning their merits, and always calling them the 'Kaunteya' (sons of Kunti). He also bore a deep hatred of Bhima, who was his age and dominated his brothers in sport and skill with his immense physical power and strength. When they were young, Bhima's bullying and taunting were a constant <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>pain</b> for Duryodhana and his brothers.|$|E
25|$|Primal {{therapy is}} a trauma-based {{psychotherapy}} created by Arthur Janov, who argues that neurosis {{is caused by}} the repressed pain of childhood trauma. Janov argues that repressed pain can be sequentially brought to conscious awareness and resolved through re-experiencing specific incidents and fully expressing the resulting pain during therapy. In therapy, the patient recalls and reenacts a particularly disturbing past experience usually occurring early in life and expresses normally repressed anger or frustration especially through spontaneous and unrestrained screams, hysteria, or violence. Primal therapy was developed as a means of eliciting the repressed pain; the term Pain is capitalized in discussions of primal therapy when referring to any repressed emotional distress and its purported long-lasting psychological effects. Janov criticizes the talking therapies as they deal primarily with the cerebral cortex and higher-reasoning areas and do not access the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>Pain</b> within the more basic parts of the central nervous system.|$|E

500|$|The Celebration {{has often}} been criticized with {{allegations}} of soring of horses at the event, an abusive practice designed to make horses step higher and illegal under federal law by the Horse Protection Act of 1970. The sponsors of the Celebration have consistently denied the allegations. Every horse entered in the Celebration must undergo an inspection designed to detect sored horses conducted by an APHIS-employed inspector before the horse is allowed to show. Inspectors may use hoof testers (plier-like tools which direct pressure on {{an area of the}} foot to find any <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>pain),</b> leg swabs and other tools such as thermography to detect signs of horses being sored. In 2006, the concerns escalated between trainers and inspectors from APHIS. [...] Initially, trainers refused to submit their horses for inspection, creating a stand-off that required law enforcement intervention. Then, prior to the World Grand Championship finals, inspectors disqualified all but three of the finalists. [...] A group of approximately 150 people gathered, demanding that the disqualified horses be allowed to show. However, citing safety concerns, the show management cancelled the class altogether and no World Grand Champion was crowned that year.|$|E

5000|$|The {{adjective}} 'psychological' {{is thought}} to encompass the functions of beliefs, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, which {{may be seen as}} an indication for the many <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> psychological <b>pain.</b> One way <b>of</b> grouping these different <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>pain</b> was offered by Shneidman, who stated that psychological pain is caused by frustrated psychological needs. [...] For example, the need for love, autonomy, affiliation, and achievement, or the need to avoid harm, shame, and embarrassment. Psychological needs were originally described by Henry Murray in 1938 as needs that motivate human behavior. Shneidman maintained that people rate the importance of each need differently, which explains why people's level <b>of</b> psychological <b>pain</b> differs when confronted with the same frustrated need.

This study was {{designed}} to determine the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> LBP and its relations with age and gender. Settings and Design: A retrospective chart review at Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran. Materials and Methods: A total of 1, 125 patients were evaluated to determine the <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> their LBP with physical examinations, imaging, injections, and other laboratory examinations, if needed. The patients were divided into five groups based on their ages. Frequencies <b>of</b> the <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>pain</b> were assessed in the five age groups, and the assessments were done separately by gender. Statistical Analysis Used: Independent t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), chi-square test. Results: The patients enrolled in this study consisted of 527 males (46. 8 %) and 598 females (53. 2 %). The frequencies <b>of</b> the <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>pain</b> were, in descending order, spine (689, 61. 2 %), no cause found (163, 14. 5 %), spine with sacroiliac joint (SIJ) (72, 6. 4 %), spine with hip (65, 5. 8 %), SIJ (60, 5. 3 %), hip (44, 3. 9 %), spine along with hip and SIJ (20, 1. 8 %), hip with SIJ (8, 0. 7 %), and other diseases (4, 0. 4 %). There were significant statistical differences between the genders and mean ages for different sources (P = 0. 03 and 0. 000, respectively). Conclusions: This study showed that the spine was the main <b>source</b> <b>of</b> LBP in all age groups. Physicians should always be alert for other sources in middle-aged and older patients.

40|$|One {{important}} {{requirement for}} animal welfare {{is to maintain}} animals free from pain, injury or disease. Therefore, detecting and evaluating the intensity <b>of</b> animal <b>pain</b> is crucial. Since animals cannot directlycommunicate their feelings sensitive and specific indicators easy to use have to be identified. Behaviouralchanges associated with <b>pain</b> are one <b>of</b> the techniques most frequently used on farms to assess the degreeof pain experienced by pigs or ruminants. Pain, as a stressor, is associated to variations in the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis {{as well as in}} the sympathetic and immune systems that can be used to identify the presence <b>of</b> <b>pain</b> rapidly after it started. However, most of these measures need sophisticated equipmentfor their assessment and they are mainly adapted to experimental situations. Injuries and other indicators oflesions give information on the <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>pain</b> and are convenient to use in all types of situations. Histopathological analyses can identify <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>pain</b> and are especially useful to detect long term effects ofmutilation practises that are performed in farms. When pronounced and/or long-lasting, the pain-inducedbehavioural and physiological changes can decrease production performance. Some indicators are veryspeci¿ c and sensitive to pain whereas others are more generally related to stressful situations.
