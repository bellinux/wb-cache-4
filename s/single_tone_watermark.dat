40|$|The {{perception}} of two simultaneous tones {{was investigated in}} goldfish using classical respiratory conditioning and a stimulus generalization paradigm. Pairs of tones were used {{to make up a}} mixture of 150 Hz and a higher harmonic or a mistuned harmonic. Fish were conditioned to the two-tone mixture and then tested for generalization to several pure tones. The simultaneous tones tended to be segregated in perception, with the generalization gradient for <b>single</b> <b>tones</b> having two peaks corresponding to the frequencies of the tone pairs. There were no consistent differences in the generalization gradients following conditioning to harmonic or inharmonic tone pairs. In addition, experiments were carried out in which the two tones of the pair were heard on alternate trials, always as <b>single</b> <b>tones,</b> followed by generalization tests to <b>single</b> <b>tones.</b> There was more generalization in this experiment, reflecting the fact that conditioning and generalization test stimuli were both <b>single</b> <b>tones.</b> However, the shapes of the generalization gradients were similar to those in which fish were conditioned to two simultaneous tones, indicating that the simultaneity of the tones did not make them harder to segregate. As the frequency separation between the two components narrowed, segregation tended to fail...|$|R

40|$|A {{multifrequency radar}} system for {{detecting}} humans and classifying their activities at {{short and long}} ranges is described. The short-range radar system operates within the S-Band frequency range for through-wall applications at distances of up to 3 [*]m. It utilizes two separate waveforms which are selected via switching: a wide-band noise waveform or a continuous <b>single</b> <b>tone.</b> The long-range radar system operating in the W-Band millimeter-wave frequency range performs at distances of up to about 100 [*]m in free space and up to about 30 [*]m through light foliage. It employs a composite multimodal signal consisting of two waveforms, a wide-band noise waveform and an embedded <b>single</b> <b>tone,</b> which are summed and transmitted simultaneously. Matched filtering of the received and transmitted noise signals is performed to detect targets with high-range resolution, whereas the received <b>single</b> <b>tone</b> signal {{is used for the}} Doppler analysis.

40|$|Frequency {{estimation}} of a <b>single</b> <b>tone</b> signal {{is important in}} many applications. In this study, a frequency estimation algorithm is proposed for <b>single</b> <b>tone</b> signals modulated with unknown data. The proposed unbiased frequency estimator (UFE) uses discrete Fourier transform (DFT) coefficients to calculate the accurate frequency offset. To achieve better performance in a noisy environment, a biased frequency estimator (BFE) is obtained by applying trigonometric approximation to UFE. The Taylor expansion of BFE is also proposed to meet the computational complexity requirement in some real-time applications. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations, compared with conventional interpolated DFT-based algorithm and typical non-data-aided frequency estimation algorithm...|$|R

40|$|The limiter is a {{commonly}} used device in communication receiving systems {{to remove the}} amplitude variations of the received signal, but it is usually observed that limiter degrades the envelope detection performance of a <b>single</b> <b>tone.</b> In this thesis, it is demonstrated that the limiter-generated third harmonic {{can be used to}} improve the envelope detection performance of a <b>single</b> <b>tone</b> over that of the linearly processed fundamental. Differences in the probability distributions of the limiter-generated harmonics cause differences in their detection probabilities, which lead to differences in the performance of subsequent envelope detection. Comparison of the envelope detection performance of the limiter-generated third harmonic and the input to the limiter shows a maximum detection probability gain of 1. 12 and also error probability gain of 2. 4 in linear scale, whereas the fundamental harmonic does not show any practically significant gain. The envelope detection performance of the vector sum of the limiter-generated fundamental and third harmonics is also evaluated. This combination provides better performance than do the individual harmonics, especially for a large clipping parameter of the limiter. The combined harmonics shows a maximum detetction probability gain of 1. 15 and error probability gain of 14, over that of the envelope detection performance of a tone without limiter. It is also observed that the envelope detection performance of a tone with limiter-generated higher harmonics shows non-monotonic behaviour as functions of either noise or the limiter-clipping parameter, which is a signature of stochastic resonance. The theoretical results from earlier research on the envelope detection of a <b>single</b> <b>tone</b> embedded in additive white Gaussian noise, both with and without a limiter, are presented and shown to match our simulation results. In previous work when a limiter was used in the envelope detection of a <b>single</b> <b>tone,</b> only the envelope of the fundamental harmonic was considered under very specific conditions. By contrast we also take notice of the limiter-generated higher harmonics and obtain improved envelope detection performance in the detection of a <b>single</b> <b>tone...</b>|$|R
