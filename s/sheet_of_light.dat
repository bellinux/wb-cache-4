From the attic I could see nearly all Thrums, but, until very late, the night was dark, and the brae, except {{immediately}} before the door, was blurred and dim.

60|$|A long {{swelling}} moan, sad, low, {{like the}} uneasy sigh of the sea, breathed {{far in the}} west.

60|$|The {{light at}} the top of the tower was {{produced}} by a fire, made of such combustibles as would emit the brightest flame. This fire burned slowly through the day, and then was kindled up anew when the sun went down, and was continually replenished through the night with fresh supplies of fuel. In modern times, a much more convenient and economical mode is adopted to produce the requisite illumination. A great blazing lamp burns brilliantly in the center of the lantern of the tower, and all that part of the radiation from the flame which would naturally have beamed upward, or downward, or laterally, or back toward the land, is so turned by a curious system of reflectors and polyzonal lenses, most ingeniously contrived and very exactly adjusted, as to be thrown forward in one broad and thin, but brilliant <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> which shoots out where its radiance is needed, over the surface of the sea. Before these inventions were perfected, far the largest portion of the light emitted by the illumination of light-house towers streamed away wastefully in landward directions, or was lost among the stars.|$|E
5000|$|The Benoy Dial {{was invented}} by Walter Gordon Benoy of Collingham in Nottinghamshire. Light is used to replace the shadow-edge of a gnomon. Whereas a gnomon casts a sheet of shadow, an {{equivalent}} <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> can be created by allowing the Sun's rays through a thin slit, reflecting them from a long, slim mirror (usually half-cylindrical), or focusing them through a cylindrical lens. For illustration, the Benoy Dial uses a cylindrical lens to create a <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> which falls as a line on the dial surface. Benoy dials can be seen throughout Great Britain, such as ...|$|E
50|$|If {{the scene}} is {{illuminated}} with a <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> this creates a reflected line {{as seen from the}} light source. From any point out of the plane of the sheet the line will typically appear as a curve, the exact shape of which depends both on the distance between the observer and the light source, and the distance between the light source and the reflected points. By observing the reflected <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> using a camera (often a high resolution camera) and knowing the positions and orientations of both camera and light source, it is possible to determine the distances between the reflected points and the light source or camera.|$|E

50|$|The {{slit lamp}} is an {{instrument}} {{consisting of a}} high-intensity light source that can be focused to shine a thin <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> into the eye. It is {{used in conjunction with}} a biomicroscope. The lamp facilitates an examination of the anterior segment and posterior segment of the human eye, which includes the eyelid, sclera, conjunctiva, iris, natural crystalline lens, and cornea. The binocular slit-lamp examination provides a stereoscopic magnified view of the eye structures in detail, enabling anatomical diagnoses to be made for a variety of eye conditions. A second, hand-held lens is used to examine the retina.|$|E
50|$|In {{this type}} of microscopy, the {{illumination}} is done perpendicularly to the direction of observation (see schematic image {{at the top of}} the article). The expanded beam of a laser is focused in only one direction by a cylindrical lens, or by a combination of a cylindrical lens and a microscope objective as the latter is available in better optical quality and with higher numerical aperture than the first. This way a thin <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> or lightsheet is created in the focal region that can be used to excite fluorescence only in a thin slice (usually a few micrometers thin) of the sample.|$|E
5000|$|A plate burner {{is part of}} the CTF print workflow. In a CTF workflow, a <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> {{sensitive}} film is imaged {{directly from}} a RIP. The film must then be developed immediately afterwards. This film is then placed onto a printing plate, on the plate burner. Registration of the plate and film is controlled by a pin grid. After securing the plate and film to the grid, a glass cover is lowered upon the plate and film. The film and plate are placed into a vacuum on the plate burner to remove any pockets of air and ensure the film is in close contact with the surface of the printing plate. Once the vacuum is established, a high power (5 kW) UV lamp (also associated with the burner) is turned on, which [...] "burns" [...] an image through the film and onto the plate. The plate is then processed, and put onto the offset printing press.|$|E

5000|$|Cinematographer George J. Folsey, ASC thus {{recounted the}} history: While {{shooting}} a scene with {{an actor who}} was wearing a white shirt, he wanted to separate the skin tones on the actor’s face from the hue of the shirt. Folsey told a grip to hold a stepladder {{in front of a}} key light to create a shadow on the actor’s shirt. The closer that the ladder was held to the light, the softer and less defined the shadow became. The grip eventually tired of holding the ladder, so he cut a grill with the same pattern in a <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> wood. One day, Folsey visited Hal Rosson, ASC, who was shooting on another set. In the scene, an actress was lying on a bed swathed in white sheets. Rosson used Folsey’s wooden grill to create some shadows, which made the scene more dramatic. Later, while shooting a similar situation, Rosson asked Folsey, “Where’s that kookaloris thing?” Kodak: The Essential Reference Guide for Filmmakers ...|$|E
5000|$|In lattice {{light sheet}} {{microscopy}}, {{very similar to}} light sheet microscopy the illumination of the sample occurs perpendicular to the image detection. Initially the light sheet is formed by stretching the linearly polarized circular input beam {{with a pair of}} cylindrical lenses along the x axis and then compressing it with an additional pair of lenses along the z axis. [...] This modification creates a thin <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> that is then projected onto a binary ferroelectric spatial light modulator (SLM). The SLM is a device that spatially varies the waveform of a beam of light. The light that is reflected back from the SLM is used to eliminate unwanted diffraction. Diffraction is eliminated by the transform lens that creates a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern from the reflected light at an opaque mask containing a transparent annulus. [...] Optical lattices are two or three dimensional interference patterns, which here are produced by the transparent annular ring. The mask is conjugate to x and z galvanometers. This quality of the microscope is important for the dithered mode of operation, where the light sheet must be oscillated within the x axis.|$|E
