40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between doctor managers and senior health <b>service</b> <b>administrators</b> (CEOs or General Managers) {{within the context of}} Australian health reform. Government funding for health services has become increasingly driven by government defined measurable performance targets and resources. These policy changes have implications for hospitals to be managed more cost effectively and efficiently. Hence, one of the challenges of health reform, for those managing hospitals, is a need to have a unified position in their collective ownership of managing the organisation. However, differences in the professional cultures, backgrounds, and training of health <b>service</b> <b>administrators</b> and doctor managers influence how each actor thinks about their roles as managers within the hospital. This paper reports on qualitative data used to explore the role of doctor managers in Australia. One area identified by the research participants was that high levels of hospital CEO turnover contributes to lack of engagement between doctor managers and senior health <b>service</b> <b>administrators,</b> influencing their ability to meet the continual challenges of health reform. This paper highlights the need for future research to expand understanding of doctor manager and health <b>service</b> <b>administrator</b> engagement as they work together toward meeting the demands of health reform.

40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of three high-profile honor killings the social <b>service</b> <b>administrators</b> became strongly criticized for their lack of skills and knowledge {{when it comes to}} dealing with honorrelated cases.

The aim {{of this study is to}} examine how social <b>service</b> <b>administrators</b> perceive their professional knowledge regarding to their work in honor-related cases. How they perceive their competence and discretion in relation to the work of honor-related problems and their perception of what resources the organization has to provide training and skill development in this area. The study shows that the social <b>service</b> <b>administrators</b> experience that there has been a development of knowledge in some areas regarding their work with honor-related cases but that there still exists an uneven distribution in terms of knowledge between small and large communities in Sweden...|$|R
