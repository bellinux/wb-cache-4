40|$|Purpose: This study {{compared}} 3 {{methods of}} measuring <b>sagittal</b> <b>height</b> {{of the eye}} (Zeiss Visante anterior segment OCT, Eaglet Eye Surface Profiler (ESP), and Medmont E 300 Corneal Topographer Estimated <b>Sagittal</b> <b>Height</b> (ESH) software) and evaluated the ability of each to predict central clearance of a scleral contact lens. Methods: <b>Sagittal</b> <b>height</b> at a chord of 15 mm was measured on 52 normal eyes with each of 3 methods. Visante OCT corneal sections were measured with calipers, Eaglet software analyzed ESP corneal sclera maps, and Medmont ESH software utilized composite corneal topography for calculations. A random subset of 30 eyes was selected to wear an ICD 16. 5 (Valley Contax) 4400 µm lens, and central clearance was measured on Visante OCT scans taken within 5 minutes of lens insertion. Results: <b>Sagittal</b> <b>height</b> measurements differed by method [F(2, 102) = 8. 12, p 3 ̆c 0. 001]. Eaglet ESP values were significantly lower than Zeiss OCT and significantly lower than Medmont ESH (p’sp 0. 29). Conclusions: Medmont ESH module <b>sagittal</b> <b>height</b> measurements do not significantly differ from Visante OCT, a highly specialized imaging instrument. Eaglet ESP <b>sagittal</b> <b>height</b> measurements were significantly lower than both Medmont ESH and Visante OCT. As Placido ring topographers are common in clinical practice, the addition of software such as the Medmont ESH may empower more clinicians to make precise measurements to aid the process of scleral lens fitting...|$|E

A prototype time domain OCT scanner was used to image the anterior segment of patients fitted with large diameter (18. 5 – 20 [*]mm) prosthetic devices for corneal disease. OCT images were processed and analyzed to characterize corneal diameter, corneal <b>sagittal</b> <b>height,</b> scleral <b>sagittal</b> <b>height,</b> scleral toricity, and alignment of device. Within-subject variance of OCT-measured parameters was evaluated. OCT-measured parameters were compared with device parameters for each eye fitted.

40|$|We {{report the}} case of a 35 -year-old woman {{diagnosed}} with keratoconus since she was 18 years old and wearer of corneal rigid contact lenses (CLs). We refitted the case with the fully scleral CL ICD 16. 5 (Paragon Vision Sciences) for obtaining not only a successful visual restoration, but also a comfortable wear. We initiated the fitting with the spherical model of the CL, but it failed due to instability of the lens. We confirmed the presence of a clear asymmetry in the anterior scleral geometry in both eyes by using the profilometer eye surface profiler (ESP, Eaglet Eye), with a difference between nasal and temporal <b>sagittal</b> <b>heights</b> of 470 and 170 μm in right and left eyes respectively. Although this profile suggested the need for the fitting of a CL with significant peripheral toricity, we followed the manufacturer’s guidelines and performed a trial with a CL of moderate peripheral toricity (125 μm of difference between steep and flat meridian). The stability of the CL failed again and finally a CL with a peripheral toricity close to that measured with the profilometer was fitted. With this lens, good visual performance, lens stability, and comfort was obtained and maintained during a 1 -year follow-up. This case suggests that fully scleral CLs fitting might be optimized with the use of corneo-scleral profilometers, minimizing potentially the number of trials. This potential benefit should be investigated further in future studies...|$|R

SETTING: Department of Physics (Optometry), University of Minho, Braga, Portugal. METHODS: Thirty-six eyes of 36 patients were evaluated using a videokeratoscope, and the Q-values were recorded. Topographic data were also analyzed using Vol-CT 6. 89 software (Sarver & Associates, Inc) {{to obtain the}} Q-values with different corneal diameters (3. 0 mm, 4. 0 mm, 5. 0 mm, 6. 0 mm, and 7. 0 mm). Variable Q models of corneal <b>sagittal</b> <b>height</b> were compared against models assuming constant Q-values obtained with the Medmont E 300 videokeratoscope (Medmont Pty. Ltd.) and a standard Q model of - 0. 26. RESULTS: The peripheral rate of change in corneal Q with different corneal diameters increased as corneal astigmatism increased. As a result, differences in the <b>sagittal</b> <b>height</b> between the constant model and variable model were evident beyond the central 3. 0 mm area. There were significant differences between low and high astigmatic corneas in Q-values measured by the Medmont along the flattest meridian (P =. 004) and Q-values obtained with Vol-CT software with a 7. 0 mm corneal diameter (P =. 026).

40|$|Objective. Intertester {{reliability}} {{is imperative}} during the sonographic assessment of patellar tendinopathy because hypoechoic areas can change over time, and repeated examination may involve multiple examiners. Given that, to our knowledge, {{it has not}} been reported in the literature, the objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the intertester reliability of sonography for the detection and measurement of hypoechoic areas associated with patellar tendinopathy. Methods. The study cohort comprised 8 patients with clinically diagnosed patellar tendinopathy and 4 patients with bilateral asymptomatic patellar tendons. Two equally experienced musculoskeletal radiologists imaged both patellar tendons from each patient (n = 24). All 24 tendons were assessed on the same day with the use of identical sonography machines. Results. The radiologists had 100 % chance-corrected agreement for detecting 12 normal (hypoechoic free) and 12 abnormal (hypoechoic) tendons. All measurement data were normally distributed (P >. 05), and a range of hypoechoic area sizes was evident. No statistically significant differences were found for the measurements of hypoechoic area, axial plane height and width, and <b>sagittal</b> plane <b>height</b> (P >. 05). In addition, these measurements were equally highly correlated (Pearson r > 0. 87; P <. 01). Conclusions. The results reported in this study suggest that the intertester reliability of sonography for the assessment of patellar tendinopathy is high. Although these results are encouraging, a small sample was analyzed, and this increases the probability of type II measurement error. Larger studies are therefore required to confirm these findings. High intertester reliability indicates that multiple experienced radiologists can reliably assess the same tendon and provides researchers with a necessary foundation for furthering research in tendon rehabilitation. <br /...|$|R

METHODS: OCT {{data were collected from}} 204 subjects of mean age 34. 9 years (SD: ± 15. 2 yrs, range 18 to 65) using the Zeiss Visante AS-OCT and Medmont M 300 corneal topographer. Measurements of corneal diameter (CD), corneal <b>sagittal</b> <b>height</b> (CS), iris diameter (ID), corneoscleral junction angle (CSJ) and scleral radius (SR) were extracted from multiple OCT images. Horizontal visible iris diameter (HVID) and vertical palpebral aperture (PA) were measured using a slit lamp graticule. Subject body height was also measured. Associations were then sought between CSP variables and age, height, ethnicity, sex and refractive error data collected. Results: Significant correlations were found between age and ocular topography variables of HVID, PA, CSJ, SR and ID (P< 0. 0001), while height correlated with HVID, CD and ID, and power vector terms only with vertical plane keratometry, CD and CS. Significant differences were noted between ethnicities with respect to CD (P= 0. 0046), horizontal and vertical CS (P= 0. 0068 and P= 0. 0095), and also horizontal ID (P= 0. 0010), while the same variables, with the exception of vertical CS, also varied with sex; horizontal CD (P= 0. 0018), horizontal CS (P= 0. 0018) and ID (P= 0. 0012). Age accounted for up to 36 % of the variance in CSP variables.

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{contractility}} of accessory left atrial appendages (LAAs) using multiphasic cardiac CT. We retrospectively analyzed the presence, location, size and contractile properties of accessory LAAs using multiphasic cardiac 64 -slice CT in 102 consecutive patients (63 males, 39 females, mean age 57). Multiplanar reformats {{were used to}} create image planes in axial oblique, sagittal oblique and coronal oblique planes. For all appendages with an orifice diameter >or= 10 mm, axial and sagittal diameters and appendage volumes were recorded in atrial diastole and systole. Regression analysis was performed to assess which imaging appearances best predicted accessory appendage contractility. Twenty-three (23 %) patients demonstrated an accessory LAA, all identified along the anterior LA wall. Dimensions for axial oblique (AOD) and sagittal oblique (SOD) diameters and sagittal oblique length (SOL) were 6. 3 - 19, 3. 4 - 20 and 5 - 21 mm, respectively. All appendages (>or= 10 mm) demonstrated significant contraction during atrial systole (greatest diameter reduction was AOD [3. 8 mm, 27 %]). Significant correlations were noted between AOD-contraction and AOD (R = 0. 57, P < 0. 05) and SOD-contraction and AOD, SOD and SOL (R = 0. 6, P < 0. 05). Mean diverticulum volume in atrial diastole was 468. 4 +/- 493 mm(3) and in systole was 171. 2 +/- 122 mm(3), indicating a mean change in volume of 297. 2 +/- 390 mm(3), P < 0. 0001.

Methods A total of 1341 Framingham Heart Study participants in 310 families genotyped with the Affymetrix 100 K SNP GeneChip had adiposity traits measured over 30 years of follow up. Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), weight change, height, and radiographic measures of adiposity (subcutaneous adipose tissue, visceral adipose tissue, waist circumference, <b>sagittal</b> <b>height)</b> were measured at multiple examination cycles. Multivariable-adjusted residuals, adjusting for age, age-squared, sex, smoking, and menopausal status, were evaluated {{in association with the}} genotype data using additive Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) and Family Based Association Test (FBAT) models. We prioritized mean BMI over offspring examinations (1 – 7) and cohort examinations (10, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26) and mean WC over offspring examinations (4 – 7) for presentation. We evaluated associations with 70, 987 SNPs on autosomes with minor allele frequencies of at least 0. 10, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p ≥ 0. 001, and call rates of at least 80 %.

Obesity measures used included weight, waist circumference, waist:hip ratio, waist:height ratio, abdominal height, triceps and subscapular skinfold thicknesses, body mass index, and conicity index. Abdominal height was highly correlated with other obesity measures, especially waist circumference (0. 937 - 0. 944, p < 0. 001), and was least correlated with height. In multivariate analysis, abdominal height was an independent predictor of levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, very low density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, glucose, and insulin and of systolic and diastolic blood pressures (p < 0. 05 to p < 0. 001), with total R 2 values ranging from 0. 13 to 0. 52.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the relationships of selected facial measurements with mesio-distal crown widths and dental arch dimensions in individuals with normal occlusions. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 276 subjects with Angle's Class I normal occlusions. Three-dimensional images of the face and dental casts were captured and analyzed using stereophotogrammetric systems. Significant correlations were found between the sagittal facial variables and both upper and lower dental arch dimensions and to lesser degree with the horizontal and vertical variables. The values of correlation coefficients calculated between facial and dental crown measurements ranged from. 01 to. 50 for upper teeth and. 01 to. 49 for lower teeth. The values of correlation coefficients between facial and upper dental arch dimensions ranged from. 01 to. 55 and those between facial and lower dental arch dimensions ranged from. 01 to. 60. A principal components analysis showed that the <b>sagittal</b> dimensions, face <b>height,</b> nose, labial fissure, binocular widths were positively associated with dental arch dimensions and mesio-distal crown diameters in males. On the other hand, only the sagittal variables were associated with dental dimensions in females. The results of this study confirm that positive associations exist between facial and dental arch dimensions. These relationships should be taken into consideration when attempts are made to modify dental arch size as part of orthodontic treatment. Moreover, these relationships are also relevant to prosthodontists involved with selecting tooth sizes that display optimal functional balance with the craniofacial structures. Ali R.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{theme of}} this thesis is the identification of additional factors affecting, and consequently to better allow, the prediction of soft contact lens fit. Various models have been put forward {{in an attempt to}} predict the parameters that influence soft contact lens fit dynamics; however, the factors that influence variation in soft lens fit are still not fully understood. The investigations in this body of work involved the use of a variety of different imaging techniques to both quantify the anterior ocular topography and assess lens fit. The use of Anterior-Segment Optical Coherence Tomography (AS-OCT) allowed for a more complete characterisation of the cornea and corneoscleral profile (CSP) than either conventional keratometry or videokeratoscopy alone, and for the collection of normative data relating to the CSP for a substantial sample size. The scleral face was identified as being rotationally asymmetric, the mean corneoscleral junction (CSJ) angle being sharpest nasally and becoming progressively flatter at the temporal, inferior and superior limbal junctions. Additionally, 77 % of all CSJ angles were within ± 50 of 1800, demonstrating an almost tangential extension of the cornea to form the paralimbal sclera. Use of AS-OCT allowed for a more robust determination of corneal diameter than that of white-to-white (WTW) measurement, which is highly variable and dependent on changes in peripheral corneal transparency. Significant differences in ocular topography were found between different ethnicities and sexes, most notably for corneal diameter and corneal <b>sagittal</b> <b>height</b> variables. Lens tightness was found to be significantly correlated with the difference between horizontal CSJ angles (r =+ 0. 40, P = 0. 0086). Modelling of the CSP data gained allowed for prediction of up to 24 % of the variance in contact lens fit; however, it was likely that stronger associations and an increase in the modelled prediction of variance in fit may have occurred had an objective method of lens fit assessment have been made. A subsequent investigation to determine the validity and repeatability of objective contact lens fit assessment using digital video capture showed no significant benefit over subjective evaluation. The technique, however, was employed in the ensuing investigation to show significant changes in lens fit between 8 hours (the longest duration of wear previously examined) and 16 hours, demonstrating that wearing time is an additional factor driving lens fit dynamics. The modelling of data from enhanced videokeratoscopy composite maps alone allowed for up to 77 % of the variance in soft contact lens fit, and up to almost 90 % to be predicted when used in conjunction with OCT. The investigations provided further insight into the ocular topography and factors affecting soft contact lens fit...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the efficacy and safety of balloon kyphoplasty (BK) in the management of vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). This study is based on a systematic review of the literature (until October 2004) and meta-analysis of clinical studies assessing the efficacy and safety of BK in the treatment of VCFs. Estimates of effect were based on a random effects model. Meta-regression analyses were carried out where required. A total of 26 studies met the inclusion criteria. Although studies displayed considerable methodological limitations, the results of the clinical series indicate significant improvements in pain intensity, vertebral <b>height,</b> <b>sagittal</b> alignment, functional capacity, and quality of life. Compared with conventional medical management, BK afforded significant improvement in pain intensity and mobility. Likewise, a significant reduction was observed in vertebral collapse, kyphotic deformity, the development of new vertebral fractures, and hospital stay. Compared with vertebroplasty, the technique reduced the loss of height and the degree of kyphotic deformity, and afforded a significantly lower leakage rate—with no differences in relation to other variables. Regarding adverse effects, leakage affected 7 % of all levels treated, while complications were recorded in 2 % of the patients, and new vertebral fractures in 16 %. The available evidence suggests that BK can be effective and safe in application to VCFs. However, existing studies evince substantial methodological limitations and relatively short follow-up periods. Better clinical research is required to determine the capacity of BK to avoid the functional and physiological sequelae of VCFs and to define the true role of the technique among the existing therapeutic options...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY The aim of {{this study}} was to develop {{standard}} cephalometric values for Slovenians in the period of the mixed dentition. Eighty-eight children were included in the study (46 girls and 42 boys, mean age 9. 31 ± 1. 52 years). The selection criteria were: in the mixed dentition, a score of the modifi ed Eismann method for an objective assessment of malocclusion of less than 15 points, the absence of aplasia and supernumerary teeth, no congential anomalies and no previous orthodontic treatment. Twenty-fi ve cephalometric measurements were performed twice to analyse the size and shape of the craniofacial complex. The reliability of the measurements was assessed by correlation coeffi cients, regression, and analysis of inter-subject differences; satisfactory results were obtained. The differences between boys and girls and between those in the early and late mixed dentition period were tested with a two-way analysis of variance. The most pronounced changes between the early and late mixed dentition were observed in the vertical skeletal relationships: a decrease in mandibular inclination, interbasal angle and gonial angle, and an increase in anterior and posterior face <b>height.</b> <b>Sagittal</b> skeletal relationships remained constant from the early to the late mixed dentition. No signifi cant differences were found between the observed developmental stages. Signifi cant differences between genders were found only for anterior and posterior face height, with boys showing larger values (P ≤ 0. 001). As there were no signifi cant differences between the early and late mixed dentition, the mean measurement values of the total sample can be used as cephalometric standards for Slovenians in the mixed dentition period...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Quantitative {{documentation}} of primary mechanical overload injury to lumbar vertebrae and discs caused by long-term exposure to heavy physical exertions or whole-body vibration at the workplace. Study design: A cross sectional study measuring vertebral <b>height,</b> <b>sagittal</b> plane displacement and disc height from lateral radiographic views of exposed cohorts and comparing the results with a normative database complied from radiographs of unexposed, healthy subjects. Background: Current guidelines {{on health and}} safety during manual handling and lifting as well as under conditions of whole-body vibration are aimed at minimising potential risks specifically to the lumbar spine. Such regulations affect {{a large percentage of}} the labour force, and their enforcement constitutes a major economic factor. Up to now, however, the prevalence of work-related primary mechanical overload damage to lumbar vertebrae and discs has not been quantified and the effectiveness of the guidelines in preventing overload damage has not been proven. Methods: Overload damage to the lumbar spine is expected to result potentially in (i) fractures effecting a decrease in vertebral height or a wedge shape of vertebral bodies, (ii) a derangement of the sagittal plane alignment of lumbar vertebrae, resulting in dorso-ventral displacement, or (iii) primary injury to intervertebral discs or fracture of vertebral endplates, resulting in a decrease in disc height. To assess the occurrence and magnitude of such damage, archive lateral radiographic views and work histories of 355 subjects with long-term exposure to heavy physical exertions or whole-body vibration at the workplace were collected from 8 cohorts in the steel, mining and oil industries as well as from public services. Vertebral <b>height,</b> <b>sagittal</b> plane displacement and disc height were measured, employing advanced methods of image analysis compensating for distortion in central projection as well as for variation in radiographic technique, patient posture and stature. The measured data were compared with age-appropriate data of normative databases, previously compiled from radiographs of healthy, male, unexposed subjects (n= 737) in the age range between 17 and 57 years. Results: Comparison with normative databases demonstrates that in the cohorts under study (save for a cohort performing a specialised task in a forward bent posture and a cohort of miners with mean age close to 60 y) neither exposure to very heavy physical exertions in manual labour nor exposure to whole-body vibration or shock loading resulted in a height decrease or wedge-shape deformation of lumbar vertebrae. Heavy spinal loading or whole-body vibration did not lead to increased sagittal plane (dorso-ventral) displacement of lumbar vertebrae. Lifting and handling very heavy objects, specifically when working in confined spaces or on uneven ground, lead to a noticeable and significant decrease in the height of lumbar discs. While exposure to vibration on damped machine operators' seats did not lead to a reduction in disc height, vibration and shock loading transmitted from unsprung seats on (in some cases) unsprung machines resulted in a noticeable and significant decrease in lumbar disc height. Conclusions: This study demonstrates, for the first time, objectively and quantitatively that spinal loading in certain industrial workplaces can result in damage to lumbar discs. Heights of vertebral bodies and sagittal plane displacement were generally unaffected. Any workplaces with characteristics similar to those identified here as detrimental are in urgent need of ergonomic redesign. That ergonomic redesign can be effective in reducing spinal overload damage is starkly demonstrated by comparing the results from vibration-exposed cohorts of machine operators using damped as opposed to unsprung seats. The question of whether heavy work is related to the prevalence of symptoms and/or resultant disability remains to be determined, but the results here suggest that existing ergonomic guidelines are justified to reduce the risk of irreversible spinal damage...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Effective {{methods for}} {{assessing}} visceral fat {{are important to}} investigate the role of visceral fat for the increased health risks in obesity. Techniques for direct measurement of soft tissue composition such as CT or MRI are expensive, time-consuming or require a relatively high radiation dose. Simple anthropometric methods, such as waist-to-hip ratio, waist circumference or sagittal diameter are widely used. However, these methods cannot differentiate between visceral and subcutaneous fat and are less accurate. The aim {{of the present study}} is to investigate whether the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) method, possibly combined with anthropometry, offers a good alternative to CT for the prediction of visceral fat in the elderly. METHODS: Subjects were participants in the Health ABC-study, a cohort study of black and white men and women aged 70 - 79, investigating the effect of weight-related health conditions on disablement. Total body fat and trunk fat were measured by DXA using a Hologic QDR 1500. A 10 mm CT scan at the L 4 -L 5 level was acquired to measure visceral fat and total abdominal fat. Weight, <b>height,</b> <b>sagittal</b> diameter and waist circumference were measured using standard methods. Fat in a manually defined DXA subregion (4 cm slice at the top of iliac crest) at the abdomen was calculated in a sub-group of participants (n= 150; 50 % male; 45. 3 % Afro-American/ 54. 7 % Caucasian, age 70 - 79 y). This subregion, the standard trunk region and total fat were used as indicators of visceral fat. RESULTS: Total abdominal fat by DXA (subregion) was strongly correlated with total abdominal fat by CT (r ranging from 0. 87 in white men to 0. 98 in black women). The DXA subregion underestimated total abdominal fat by 10 % compared to the CT slice. The underestimation by DXA was seen especially in people with less abdominal fat. The association of visceral fat by CT with the DXA subregion (r= 0. 66, 0. 78, 0. 79 and 0. 65 for white and black men and women, respectively) was comparable with the association of the CT measure with the sagittal diameter (r= 0. 74, 0. 70, 0. 84 and 0. 68). Combining DXA measurements with anthropometry gave only limited improvement for the prediction of visceral fat by CT compared to univariate models (maximal increase of r(2) 4 %). CONCLUSION: DXA is a good alternative to CT for predicting total abdominal fat in an elderly population. For the prediction of visceral fat the sagittal diameter, which has a practical advantage compared to DXA, is just as effective...|$|R
40|$|Closed {{treatment}} may include {{a period of}} maxillomandibular fixation (MMF) followed by functional therapy, while the surgical approach involves open reduction and internal fixation; mandibular condylar fracture management {{is a matter of}} controversy despite numerous consensus meetings on open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) Design: Controlled clinical trial conducted at Khartoum Teaching Dental Hospital Objective: This study aims to compare the treatment outcomes of open versus closed reduction of mandibular condylar process fractures. This study also closely examines the risks and complications which may accompany the surgical procedure. Methodology: A total of 26 patients were enrolled, with 13 patients assigned to each group. This convenient sample was drawn from all patients presenting at the hospital over one year, who matched the study criteria and fulfilled the treatment and follow up requirements. The variables under study were differences in the condylar process <b>sagittal</b> displacement, ramus <b>height</b> shortening, and deviation on mouth opening, malocclusion and pain perception measures on the visual analogue scale (VAS). The two groups were matched for age, gender, site and mechanism of injury and controlled for preexisting differences in the outcome measures. Results: The majority of patient enrolled were males constituting 84. 6 % % of the sample. The mean patient age was 28. 31 ± 7. 56 years in the surgical treatment group and 30. 08 ± 15. 41 years in the closed treatment group. Pre-treatment, the mean sagital displacement and mean ramus height shortening in the surgical group were 15. 62 ± 3. 097 ° and 2. 38 ± 2. 022 mm respectively. In the closed treatment group the mean displacement was 14. 23 ± 3. 81 ° and the mean value for ramus height shortening was 4. 23 ± 2. 55 mm. Three months post-treatment, the mean maximal mouth opening among the surgical treatment group was 4. 3 ± 0. 77 mm, and for the closed treatment group was 3. 8 ± 0. 96 mm. Post-operative absolute deviation at maximal mouth opening was significantly higher among the closed treatment group, affecting 10 (76. 9 %) patients (P 0. 000). No significant differences were observed in the prevalence of post-operative occlusal disturbances or in the degree of pain perception. Following the surgical treatment, one patient developed infection at the surgical site and two patients developed transient facial nerve palsy. None developed permanent nerve damage, salivary fistula or Frey’s syndrome. Conclusion: There {{was no significant difference in}} the mandibular functional capacity between the two groups; deviation on mouth opening was significantly higher among patients treated conservatively. On the other hand, surgical treatment does involve the risk of transient facial palsy and, rarely, post-operative infection. There were no significant differences in the prevalence of post-operative occlusal disturbances, changes in mouth opening (inter-incisial distance) or in the degree of pain perceptio...|$|R
40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the short- and long-term effects on growth, body composition, metabolic and inflammatory markers following supplementation with the probiotic Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei F 19 (LF 19) during weaning. Methods: One-hundred and seventy-nine healthy, infants in Umeå city, Västerbotten County were randomised to daily intake of cereals with (n= 89) or without (n= 90) LF 19 108 colony-forming units from 4 to 13 months of age. Weight, length, head circumference and body composition, assessed by skinfold thickness, were examined at 4, 5. 5, 6. 5, 9, 12 and 13 months of age. Venous blood was drawn at 5. 5 and 13 months. In all, 171 infants completed the intervention and were invited to a follow-up at 8 - 9 years of age between 2009 and 2011, 120 children participated. Weight, <b>height,</b> <b>sagittal</b> abdominal diameter and body composition (using Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry-scan) were measured. Data on weight and height at 4 years were collected from medical records. The families filled out a 4 -day food record and a food frequency questionnaire, physical activity was assessed using a pedometer for 7 days. At 5. 5, 13 months and 8 - 9 years of age we analysed the serum blood lipid profile. At 8 - 9 years fasting glucose, insulin, aspartate and alanine transaminases were analysed in serum. Homeostatic Model Assessment index was calculated. At follow-up serum adiponectin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and plasma C-peptide, ghrelin, gastric inhibitory polypeptide, glucagon-like peptide 1, glucagon, insulin, leptin, plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1, resistin and visfatin were analysed. For characterisation of the plasma metabolome, a subgroup (n= 40) was analysed at 5. 5 and 13 months of age by gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF/MS) analysis and in all (n= 112) children at the follow-up using untargeted GC-GC/MS. Results: There were no differences between the LF 19 and placebo group regarding body weight, length/height at any assessment from 4 months to 8 - 9 years of age; nor were there any {{differences between the groups}} in body composition. In the LF 19 group 19 % were overweight/obese, the corresponding number was 21 % in the placebo group (p= 0. 78). Analysed metabolic and inflammatory markers, both during the intervention and the follow-up did not differ between the two groups. At 13 months of age lower levels of palmitic acid and palmitoleic acid (both p< 0. 04) and higher levels of putrescine (p< 0. 01) were seen in the LF 19 compared to the placebo group. These differences did not persist at 8 - 9 years of age. At that age, we found statistically stronger models when comparing overweight/obese and normal weight children as well as in relation to sex. Conclusion: Early intervention with the probiotic LF 19 at the time of weaning exerted transient effects on the metabolome. In a long-term perspective, we found neither benefit nor harm on growth, body composition, metabolic or inflammatory markers following supplementation with LF 19 during weaning...|$|R
