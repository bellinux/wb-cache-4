50|$|In a BBC article, a {{spokesman}} for a company offering <b>short-term</b> <b>loans</b> says that APR is not a valid model when assessing costs associated with <b>short-term</b> subprime <b>loans,</b> and that the charges are appropriate {{for the convenience of}} quickly obtaining a <b>short-term</b> <b>loan.</b> Instead, the APR model is better for assessing costs associated with a middle- or long-term loan options.|$|R
40|$|A {{financial}} institution involved in commercial lending makes a <b>short-term</b> <b>loan</b> (for example, 90 days) to a borrower under a long-term credit commitment (for example, 5 years). The {{financial institution}} transfers the <b>short-term</b> <b>loan,</b> without recourse, to a third-party purchaser {{for the remaining}} term of the loan. The risk of loss relating to the <b>short-term</b> <b>loan</b> is legally transferred to the purchaser, and the financial institution has no contractual obligation to repurchase the shortterm loan. Under the long-term credit commitment, the financial institution may, at the maturity of the <b>short-term</b> <b>loan,</b> relend to the borrower. However, the financial institution may refuse to relend to the borrower based on a current credit evaluation or if any covenant under the long-term commitment is not satisfied. The issue is whether {{the transfer of the}} <b>short-term</b> <b>loan</b> should be accounted for as a sale or as a financing.
