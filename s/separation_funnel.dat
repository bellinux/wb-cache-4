40|$|Over {{the course}} of the past year, we experimented with {{bacteriophage}} (phage) isolation from both fresh and marine water. We also tested two different chemical flocculation techniques, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and iron chloride. Furthermore, we tested different vesicles in which chemical flocculation occurs, such as <b>separation</b> <b>funnels,</b> centrifuge tubes, and Erlenmeyer flasks. We analyzed the effectiveness of flocculation via florescent microscopy. Each flocculated sample was visually compared to the original unconcentrated sample by staining the DNA with SYBR-Green. A successful concentrated viral sample yielded a 3 ̆e 10 fold increase in overall fluorescence. We found that both iron chloride and PEG were equally as effective in precipitating phage from water. Unfortunately, while the original protocols we read were designed for marine water, we had little success in precipitating phage from marine water. We tested samples of marine water from various locations, and used both methods of chemical flocculation. Despite this experimentation, we did not succeed in precipitating phage from sea water. Fresh water appeared to have a large viral load, as florescence microscopy showed large amounts of virus, even on the unconcentrated sample. Most experiments were done with fresh water since the viral load is high. We are now in the process of utilizing our library of phage pull-downs to isolate, classify and categorize phage by sequence analysis. In addition, we are exploring ways to expand our phage libraries through the isolation of host bacterial cells. Finally, we are developing strategies for screening a variety of panels of nanoparticles to determine phage-particle interaction strengths...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of pesticide residues in fruit, vegetables, rape seed and {{water has been}} improved using developments in sample handling and analytical techniques. The method development is associated with analytical difficulties, since pesticides currently used in agriculture represent a variety of chemical classes having very different physico chemical properties. The method development also encounters difficulties when many various commodity classes with different characteristics are studied. The main task in pesticide residue analysis has been to provide multi residue methods, and traditionally GC has been the main analytical technique. In order to regulate the use of hazardous pesticides, the EU commission introduces strict maximum residue levels (MRL). The need for improved sample handling and detection techniques are, however, high due to handling of lower detection limits, complex matrices and the need of more efficient sample throughput. Of the new techniques introduced as alternative techniques to the traditional extraction techniques, pressurised fluid extraction (PFE) has {{shown to be a}} promising technique in {{analysis of}} pesticide residues in fatty foodstuffs. In water analysis, large sample volumes are needed due to low MRLs. The solid phase extraction (SPE) technique allows a concentration of large sample volumes and simplifies the tedious laboratory work with traditional <b>separation</b> <b>funnels.</b> A new approach was to use non-polar solvents for the sample extraction from the earlier used polymeric column. Both these techniques provide low solvent consumption, short extraction times and ability to automate the manual steps. An LC-MS/MS multi residue method was finally developed for pesticide residues in fruit and vegetables. The technique is robust and sensitive and allows a simultaneous determination of 57 pesticides and metabolites in one single analysis and without any clean-up steps. The sensitivity was improved to achieve the maximum residue limits needed by EU. Several multi step methods, which involve more costly analysis, has been replaced by this technique...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} strategy followed {{in this work}} was inspired by natural photosynthesis that, for simplicity, {{can be divided into}} three principal steps: (i) efficient light absorption at wavelengths abundant in the solar light; (ii) long-lived charge <b>separation</b> achieved by <b>funnelling</b> of the photogenerated electrons away from the light-absorbing antenna; (iii) chemical reaction taking place at the specific catalytic sites. The idea of the present research was to mimic the key-principles of photosynthesis and implement them in Metal-Organic Frameworks. The first principle is covered in Chapter 4 where the light absorption properties of a Ti-based framework were synthetically tuned as to allow for lowering the excitation energy and sensitizing the MOF to a larger fraction of the solar spectrum. Chapters 2 and 3 investigate the photoexcitation processes in MOFs with the aim of prolonging the lifetime of photoexcited states similarly to (ii). Finally, in Chapter 5 additional catalytic sites (iii) were introduced in NH 2 -MIL- 125 (Ti) improving the catalytic activity by one order of magnitude. Chapter 1 introduces Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) as potential photocatalysts and their characteristics. At first, general synthetic strategies of improving photocatalytic activity are discussed and a brief historical overview of the TiO 2 -based catalysts development is given followed by recent advances in the field. Further, the pioneering examples of using MOFs as photocatalysts are reviewed. The development of MOF-based photocatalysts is compared against more common photocatalysts such as TiO 2. Some of the strategies such as sensitization towards a desired wavelength and introduction of additional catalytic sites are similar in both cases. At the same time MOFs are characterized by the microporous and well-defined structure, excellent tuneability and the lack of photoconductivity. All these aspects have strong implications for the synthetic strategies of the catalyst development. In this chapter three different roles of MOFs are discussed: a) MOFs as mere containers for photocatalytically active species; b) MOFs as photocatalysts both absorbing light and carrying out catalytic reactions; c) MOF-based composites where the frameworks are multifunctional, they absorb light and carry additional catalytic sites. Chapter 2. Here fundamentals of photoexcitation in NH 2 -MIL- 125 (Ti) are investigated with the help of ultrafast spectroscopy. MIL- 125 (Ti) -type frameworks are known to undergo ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) yielding Ti 3 + and the positively charged organic-defined counterparts. UV-pump Visible-probe spectroscopy has shown that the excited states of NH 2 -MIL- 125 (Ti) possess a substantially longer lifetime as compared to the amine-free analogous MOF, MIL- 125 (Ti). Moreover, the difference in spectral signatures of the excited MIL- 125 (Ti) and NH 2 -MIL- 125 (Ti) was documented and associated to the difference in the organic-defined positively charged holes. The assignment of the transient spectral features of NH 2 -MIL- 125 (Ti) was carried out with the help of spectroelectrochemistry. Vis-pump IR-probe spectroscopy demonstrated that the photogenerated holes within NH 2 -MIL- 125 (Ti) are likely localized on the NH 2 -group of aminoterephthalates as the N-H stretch vibrations are heavily involved in the photoexcitation process. Kinetics of the photogenerated charge carriers in different solvents is described: in contrast to what was expected we found that the lifetimes of the excited states do not change depending on the solvent polarity. Chapter 3. In this chapter the role of d 0 metal ion constituting frameworks of NH 2 -MIL- 125 and NH 2 -UiO- 66 is unravelled. In their works Walsh et al. have shown for the case of the MIL- 125 (Ti) series MOFs that the highest occupied crystal orbital (HOCO) is localized at the organic linker whereas the lowest unoccupied crystal orbital (LUCO) localizes at the inorganic secondary building unit (SBU), titanium oxocluster. Thus the HOCO-LUCO optical gap can be tuned by introducing various substituents into the aromatic system of the linker for the cost of modifying the oxidative power of the resulting photocatalyst. In this chapter the target reaction was hydrogen evolution. In this case, the reductive power of a photocatalyst is of crucial importance. The main hypothesis was that by changing the metal in the same group from Ti to Zr or Hf one should be able to tune this reductive power for the frameworks bearing the same organic linker and a similar topology. However, this is only true if LMCT operates in all MOFs considered. With the help of DFT {{it was found that the}} LUCO of NH 2 -MIL- 125 (Ti) is localized at the titanium oxocluster whereas the ones of NH 2 -UiO- 66 (Zr/Hf) are localized at the organic linker. The same conclusion was confirmed by EPR. This LMCT of NH 2 -MIL- 125 (Ti) possesses a substantially longer lifetime compared to the purely organic-based transitions found in the UiOs as revealed by transient absorption spectroscopy. This in turn results in a superior performance in photocatalytic H 2 evolution in the case of Ti-based MOF. The positive role of structural defects in H 2 evolution catalysed by the UiOs, although modest, was also documented. Chapter 4 introduces a framework with an extended conjugated aromatic system of the linker derived from NH 2 -MIL- 125 (Ti). The NH 2 -containing parent MOF was post-functionalized with dye-like molecular fragments resembling a well-known organic dye, methyl red. This was done by following a traditional synthetic pathway of obtaining organic dyes through the diazotization reaction. At the first stage the NH 2 -groups of NH 2 -MIL- 125 (Ti) react with nitrosonium ions, NO+, generated in situ by the HCl/NaNO 2 pair while the second step is the reaction of the obtained N?N+-MIL- 125 (Ti) with diethylaniline. The resulting MOF absorbs a larger fraction of visible light extending to ca. 620 nm and thus has a superior performance in photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Furthermore, the photoconductance of MIL- 125 (Ti) was assessed by time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC). The experiments revealed that the material demonstrates very low levels of photoconductance that are temperature dependent. This type of behaviour is characteristic of the temperature-activated hopping as a type of charge carrier transport and is in contrast to the conductance of semiconductors that hardly changes with temperature. Based on these results it was recovered that MIL- 125 (Ti) and possibly many other MOFs should not be seen as true semiconductors but rather as arrays of coordination complexes arranged in a crystalline lattice. Chapter 5 illustrates an example of Active Site Engineering in Metal-Organic Frameworks. A well-known electrocatalyst, cobaloxime was encapsulated within the cavities of NH 2 -MIL- 125 (Ti). The direct sorption of the molecular complex into the pores of MOF did not proceed likely due to the size-selectivity of the pore windows. Therefore, a two-step synthetic strategy was developed where at the first stage the pores of the MOF were loaded with a flexible organic ligand while at the second CoBr 2 was added under oxidative conditions. The organic ligand complexates with cobalt ions in the pores of NH 2 -MIL- 125 (Ti) forming a cobaloxime bearing Co(III) encapsulated the pores. The chapter contains an extensive characterization of the obtained composite and a discussion of possible differences between the molecular cobaloxime in solution vs. the one encapsulated in the MOF. The obtained Co@MOF catalyst evolves hydrogen at a rate 20 times greater than the one of the bare MOF. The external quantum efficiency for the composite was found to be 0. 5 %. This is a rather modest number if compared against the state of the art semiconductor-based systems. However, it should be emphasized that this catalyst outperforms the majority of reported MOF-based photocatalysts as explained in Chapter 5. Moreover, the composite purely consists of abundant elements (Ti, Co, C, O, N, Br, H) and, from that perspective, fulfils the global scale up requirements. Cobaloximes typically act as excellent catalytic sites yet they are not able to undergo charge separation upon illumination and require an external source of electrons. The electrons can be supplied by electrodes as well as by excited organic dye molecules. In this work with the help of EPR it was found that the MOF acts as a photosensitizer absorbing photons and injecting electrons in the cobalt complex. At the same time no Ti 3 + was detected in irradiated Co@MOF composite in contrast to what was found in the bare NH 2 -MIL- 125 (Ti). Instead, cobalt reduction from Co 3 + to Co 2 + was detected. This suggests that the electron injection from the photoexcited MOF is fast while the resting state of the Co@MOF composite is Co(II). However, the turn-over frequency of the composite is still rather moderate and a more detailed investigation of the mechanism is needed to rationalize this performance. This is an elegant example of a multifunctional catalytic system for photocatalytic generation of hydrogen by water splitting, based on the abundant element Co.

The mathematical relationship described the equilibrium rare earth concentration in the organic phase {{as a function of}} the total rare earth concentration, acidity and mole fraction of one earth in the aqueous phase. The equations were derived from step-by-step regression analysis of data from 36 equilibrium shake-out tests in which variables were measured over the following feed solution ranges: total rare earth concentration 0. 2 - 1. 0 M, acidity 0. 05 - 0. 80 M, mole fraction of Gd 0. 005 - 0. 995. All experiments were carried out at an organic /aqueous phase ratio of 1 using 1. 5 M ethylhexyl phosphinic acid mono- 2 -ethlyhexyl ester (HEH(EHP)) in Shellsol D 70. The average difference between the experimental and calculated values was less that < 4 %. These models can be used to study the extraction behaviour, and to simulate multi-stage extraction and separation of the rare earths. To verify the model, a 14 -stage counter-current extraction circuit was experimentally simulated using separating funnels. Excellent agreement was found between the simulation and stage-wise calculations using a computer program written by BGRINM which takes account of changes in acidity that accompanying rare earth extraction and the organic concentration of rare earths as predicted by the mathematical model. Separation of gadolinium and terbium was also demonstrated in a small mixer-settlers circuit comprising of 10 extraction stages and 5 scrubbing stages. The feed solution contained 75 % Gd and 25 % Tb. The mixer settler circuit was operated for 45 hours to ensure equilibrium was established. The rare earth mass balances agreed within 3 %. The product streams comprised a raffinate containing 93. 6 % Gd and an organic containing 90. 4 % Tb. Both parties are slightly lower than predicted by the stage-wise calculation and the simulation experiments using separation funnels. The discrepancies were mainly attributed to the fact that stage efficiencies were less than 100 %, and/or the fact that a different organic-phase diluent was used in the mixer settler experiment. The good agreement between the calculated and experimented results (especially in the <b>separation</b> <b>funnel</b> experiments where the stage efficiency was 100 %) indicates that the model accurately describes the equilibrium conditions over the wide range of concentrations and acidities within a counter-current solvent extraction circuit...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCurrently, {{the sulfur}} level in diesels {{is limited to}} 10 and 15 ppm in Europe and USA respectively, since the {{organosulfur}} compounds available in fuels emit corrosive SO 2 gases into atmosphere during combustion, thus leading to acid rain.

One of very powerful oxidation systems used in ODS is H 2 O 2 -formic acid and removal of alkyl-substituted derivatives of T, BT and DBT with this oxidation system is easier than that with H 2 O 2 -phosphotungstic acid catalyst system due to the steric hindrance of alkyl groups adjacent to sulfur atom because phosphotungstic acid is a bulky catalyst. In this work, oxidative desulfurization reactions of the model compounds, thiophene (T), 2 -methylthiophene (2 -MT) and 2, 5 -dimethylthiophene (2, 5 -DMT), which have the lowest reactivity in ODS, on sonication at low H 2 O 2 (O) /F (formic acid) /S (organosulfur solution) volume ratios were carried out sequentially in the presence of tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) as phase transfer catalyst at 30 and 40 °C. First, the solution of the relevant model sulfur compound in n-heptane was put into a steel batch reactor and later, reactions were performed by adding mixture of 35 % H 2 O 2, formic acid and TBAB onto the organic phase.

These synthons are usually obtained by aromatic iodination of commercial 4, 6 -diiodoanilines. Most protocols imply the use of iodine monochloride, a hazardous fuming liquid (1, 4, 5), sophisticated reagents (benzyltrimethylammonium dichloroiodate (3, 6), [K(18 -crown- 6) ](ICl 2) (7) or molecular iodine {{in combination with other}} reagents (Ag 2 SO 4 (8) or iodic acid 2). However, almost 50 years ago, the first publication describing the aromatic iodination of 2, 6 –dimethylaniline (9) implied a much simpler procedure using molecular iodine, which is also less hazardous than ICl. However, the isolation of the desired was reported only in moderate yield after a lengthy steam–distillation. While repeating this experiment we discovered that the crude material quantitatively recovered prior to distillation was analytically pure and could be used for further reactions. This simple protocol was simply scaled up to about 100 g of 4 –iodo– 2, 6 –dimethylaniline and 4 –iodo– 2, 6 –diisopropylaniline. ![Fig 1]([URL] "Fig 1 ") ### Reagents 1. 2, 6 –dimethylaniline (liquid) - 2, 6 –diisopropylaniline (liquid) - molecular diiodine (solid) - diethyl ether - saturated aqueous sodium carbonate - saturated aqueous sodium thiosulfate - CDCl 3 for NMR sample preparation ### Equipment 1. balance - fume hood - 2 L two-necked round-bottomed flask - funnel - 2 L <b>separation</b> <b>funnel</b> - 1 L or 2 L round-bottomed evaporation flask - 100 mL dropping funnel - mechanical stirrer - rotary evaporator - high vacuum pump - large crystallising dish - NMR spectrometer and tubes for NMR characterisation ### Procedure **Synthesis of 4 -iodo- 2, 6 -diisopropylaniline** 1.

It serves as a versatile starting material for the synthesis of imidazolium salts: SIMes. HBr, SIMes. HCl, SIMes. HPF 6 and SIMes. HBF 4. ### Introduction Azolium salts have become indispensable starting materials in N–heterocyclic carbene (NHC) chemistry. From being a laboratory curiosity, NHCs occupy now an important position in contemporary organometallic chemistry as powerful ligands for many catalytic reactions (ie: Negishi, Kumada–Tamao–Corriu, Sonogashira and Suzuki–Miyaura cross–coupling reaction, Buchwald–Hartwig amination, aerobic oxidation, CuAAC reaction …) as well as organocatalysts. Although diverse strategies {{have been developed to}} synthesize imidazolinium salts, they generally require the reduction of an intermediate diimine. This usually involves stoechiometric borohydride in a exothermic process which could present difficulties and hazards to scale–up. We report a simple gram scale synthesis of several imidazolinium salts (Br, Cl, PF 6 and BF 4). Through a direct double alkylation of 1, 2 –dibromethane, the corresponding diamine {{is obtained}} which serves as convenient starting material for the salts described above using convenient known procedures. ### Reagents 1. 2, 4, 6 -Trimethylaniline - 1, 2 –Dibromoethane - Methanol (technical) - Ethanol (technical and absolute) - Aqueous HBF 4 (60 %) - Aqueous HPF 6 (60 %) - Diethyl ether - Sodium carbonate - Acetyl chloride - Ethyl acetate - Anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 - Formic acid - Triethyl orthoformate ### Equipment 1.

In this protocol, N-(2 -carbomethoxyacetyl) -D-valine methyl ester, a nNOS-Capon interaction inhibitor, we named it ZLc- 002, was prepared by condensation of D-valine methyl ester hydrochloride with methyl malonyl chloride. The synthesis of some analogues of ZLc- 002 was also described. ### Introduction Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent psychiatric diseases (1). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and benzodiazepines (BZDs) are the most commonly prescribed anxiolytics. However, severe side effects for BZDs and taking effect much slowly for SSRIs render their use problematic (2). Thus, there is need to develop novel anxiolytic agents that have quicker anxiolytic potential and are clinically well tolerated. Several lines of evidence suggest that nNOS plays {{a pivotal role in}} the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders (3). nNOS contains a PDZ domain that can interact with a variety of other proteins including post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD- 95) and carboxy-terminal PDZ ligand of nNOS (CAPON) (4), a scaffolding protein that regulates dendrite and synapse, and is associated with increased severity of posttraumatic stress disorder and depression (5). The N-terminal phosphotyrosine binding domain of CAPON binds to dexamethasone-induced ras protein 1 (Dexras 1). Dexras 1 is activated by S-nitrosylation induced by nNOS in response to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) stimulation in brain. It has been demonstrated that nNOS, Capon, and Dexras 1 can form a ternary complex of nNOS-Capon-Dexras 1. The nNOS–CAPON association facilitates nNOS activation of Dexras 1 (6). In the brain, Dexras 1 negatively regulates the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (7), a kinase substantially implicated in emotional behaviors. In a recent publication, we demonstrated that disruption of the interaction of nNOS and Capon exhibits significantly anxiolytic-like effect, furthermore, based on the structural feature of the nNOS PDZ domain that bonds to the C-terminal of Capon, a series of small molecular inhibitors of the PDZ domain were designed and synthesized, and especially, the N-(2 -carbomethoxyacetyl) -D-valine methyl ester, we named it ZLc- 002, showed significant in vitro and in vivo anxiolytic activities (8). In this protocol, the detailed synthetic procedures of the ZLc- 002 and its analogues were described. ### Materials 1.
