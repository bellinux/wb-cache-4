5|$|Barnes {{gripped the}} bat very {{low on the}} handle and bent over so far in his stance that the {{knuckles}} {{of his right hand}} were level with his knees. He <b>stood</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> heels almost together and the toes of his left foot pointing toward extra cover, which left him open-chested when facing the bowler. A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow the swinging delivery and play it late if necessary. His first movement was back and across the crease to cover the stumps from the view of the bowler, putting him in position to play the hook, leg glance, sweep and his favourite square cut shot.|$|E
5|$|Hannibal <b>stood</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> men in {{the weak}} center and held them to a {{controlled}} retreat. The crescent of Hispanic and Gallic troops buckled inwards as they gradually withdrew. Knowing {{the superiority of the}} Roman infantry, Hannibal had instructed his infantry to withdraw deliberately, creating an even tighter semicircle around the attacking Roman forces. By doing so, he had turned the strength of the Roman infantry into a weakness. While the front ranks were gradually advancing, the bulk of the Roman troops began to lose their cohesion, as they began crowding themselves into the growing gap. Soon they were compacted together so closely that they had little space to wield their weapons. In pressing so far forward in their desire to destroy the retreating and seemingly collapsing line of Hispanic and Gallic troops, the Romans had ignored (possibly due to the dust) the African troops that stood uncommitted on the projecting ends of this now-reversed crescent. This also gave the Carthaginian cavalry time to drive the Roman cavalry off on both flanks and attack the Roman center in the rear. The Roman infantry, now stripped of protection on both its flanks, formed a wedge that drove deeper and deeper into the Carthaginian semicircle, driving itself into an alley formed by the African infantry on the wings. At this decisive point, Hannibal ordered his African infantry to turn inwards and advance against the Roman flanks, creating an encirclement in one of the earliest known examples of a pincer movement.|$|E

500|$|Early in September 1862, the IX Corps, Reno commanding, {{returned}} to the Army of the Potomac. Gen. Lee, emboldened by his victories, invaded Maryland and McClellan moved the Army of the Potomac northwest from Washington to meet the Confederates. Portions of the armies clashed during the Battle of South Mountain, during which the 21st played only a small part. Psychologically, however, it was a devastating fight in that it saw the death of Maj. Gen. Reno, {{who had been the}} 21st's brigade commander {{at the start of the}} war. [...] "There was not a man in the 21st who did not love him," [...] Capt. Walcott of the 21st wrote, [...] "he always <b>stood</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> men in battle." ...|$|E

500|$|The Who changed {{managers}} to Peter Meaden. He {{decided that the}} group would be ideal to represent the growing mod movement in Britain which involved fashion, scooters and music genres such as rhythm and blues, soul and beat. He renamed the group the High Numbers, dressed them up in mod clothes, secured a second, more favourable audition with Fontana and wrote the lyrics for both sides of their single [...] "Zoot Suit"/"I'm the Face" [...] to appeal to mods. The tune for [...] "Zoot Suit" [...] was [...] "Misery" [...] by the Dynamics, and [...] "I'm the Face" [...] borrowed from Slim Harpo's [...] "I Got Love If You Want It". Although Meaden tried to promote the single, it failed {{to reach the top}} 50 and the band reverted to calling themselves the Who. The group began to improve their stage image; Daltrey started using his microphone cable as a whip on stage, and occasionally leapt into the crowd; Moon threw drumsticks into the air mid-beat; Townshend mimed machine gunning the crowd with his guitar while jumping on stage and playing guitar with a fast arm-windmilling motion, or <b>stood</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> arms aloft allowing his guitar to produce feedback in a posture dubbed [...] "the Bird Man".|$|E

2500|$|Muralitharan had bowled two overs {{before lunch}} from umpire Steve Dunne's or the Members' End {{of the ground}} with umpire Hair at square leg and these passed without incident. At [...] he took up the attack from umpire Hair's or the {{southern}} end. Muralitharan's third over was a maiden with all deliveries again passed as legitimate but in his fourth Hair no-balled him twice for throwing on the fourth and sixth balls. The umpire continued to call him three times in his fifth over on the second, fourth and sixth balls. While the bowler <b>stood</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> {{hands on his hips}} perplexed, the five calls provoked an immediate response by the Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga who left the field at [...] in order to take advice from his team management. He returned at [...] and continued with Muralitharan who was called two more times in his sixth over on the second and sixth balls. At [...] Ranatunga removed the bowler from the attack, although he reintroduced him at [...] at umpire Dunne's end. Although Hair reports in his book, [...] "Decision Maker", {{that at the end of}} the tea break he stated that he would call Muralitharan no matter which end he bowled he did not do so. Muralitharan completed another twelve overs without further no-balls and, after bowling Mark Waugh, finished the day with figures of 18–3–58–1.|$|E
