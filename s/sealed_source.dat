25|$|Historically, {{the three}} main {{divisions}} of radiation therapy are external beam radiation therapy (EBRT or XRT) or teletherapy, brachytherapy or <b>sealed</b> <b>source</b> radiation therapy, and systemic radioisotope therapy or unsealed source radiotherapy. The differences relate {{to the position of}} the radiation source; external is outside the body, brachytherapy uses sealed radioactive sources placed precisely in the area under treatment, and systemic radioisotopes are given by infusion or oral ingestion. Brachytherapy can use temporary or permanent placement of radioactive sources. The temporary sources are usually placed by a technique called afterloading. In afterloading a hollow tube or applicator is placed surgically in the organ to be treated, and the sources are loaded into the applicator after the applicator is implanted. This minimizes radiation exposure to health care personnel. Particle therapy is a special case of external beam radiation therapy where the particles are protons or heavier ions. Intraoperative radiation therapy or IORT is a special type of radiation therapy that is delivered immediately after surgical removal of the cancer. This method has been employed in breast cancer (TARGeted Introperative radiation therapy or TARGIT), brain tumors and rectal cancers.|$|E

40|$|<b>Sealed</b> <b>sources</b> are small, {{relatively}} high-activity radioactive sources typically encapsulated in {{a metallic}} container. The activities {{can range from}} less than 1 mCi to over 1, 000 Ci. They are used {{in a variety of}} industries and are commonly available. Many of the sources will be classified as Greater-Than-Class C low-level radioactive waste (GTCC LLW) for the purpose of waste disposal. The US Department of Energy is responsible for disposing of this class of low-level radioactive waste. To better understand the scope of the GTCC LLW situation regarding <b>sealed</b> <b>sources</b> and to provide data to a model that projects future quantities of GTCC material, data from a comprehensive 1991 US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) survey and a related 1992 survey of Agreement States were analyzed to estimate the number, volume, and activity of Potential GTCC <b>sealed</b> <b>sources</b> currently available from specific licensees. Potential GTCC <b>sealed</b> <b>sources</b> are sources that exceed the limits stated in 10 CFR 61 when isotope concentrations are averaged over the volume of the capsule. Based on the surveys, the estimated number of existing Potential GTCC <b>sealed</b> <b>sources</b> held by specific licensees is 89, 000, with an unpackaged volume of 0. 93 m{sup 3 } and an activity of 2, 300, 000 Ci. However, current disposal practices allow concentration averaging over the disposal container, substantially reducing the number of <b>sealed</b> <b>sources</b> which will actually be classified as GTCC LLW...|$|R
40|$|Environmental hazards can {{be caused}} by radio-active waste after disposal. It is, therefore, {{important}} that safety assessment methodologies be developed and established to study and estimate the possible hazards, and institute safety methodologies that will prevent the evolution of these hazards. Spent <b>sealed</b> <b>sources</b> are a specific type of radioactive waste. According to the IAEA definition,[1] spent <b>sealed</b> <b>sources</b> are unused sources because of activity decay, damage, misuse, loss, or theft. Accidental exposure to humans from spent <b>sealed</b> <b>sources</b> can occur at the moment they become spent and before their disposal. Because of this reason, safety assessment methodologies have been tailored to suit the management of spent <b>sealed</b> <b>sources.</b> To provide an understanding of and confidence in this study, validation analysis was undertaken by considering the scenario of an accident that occurred in Egypt, June 2000 (the Meet-Halfa accident from an iridium- 192 source). The study includes consideration related to safety assessments for spent <b>sealed</b> <b>sources,</b> the processes which caused an active source to be spent, accident scenarios, mathematical models for dose calcula-tions, radiological consequences and regulatory criteria. This article also outlines a validation study which evaluated a theoretical scenario (compared to the real scenario of the Meet-Halfa accident,) based on the clinical assessment of the affected individuals...|$|R

A <b>sealed</b> <b>source</b> need only be picked up, placed in a lead container, and transported to the radioactive waste storage. In the recovery of lost sources, the IAEA recommends careful planning and using a crane or other device to place shielding (such as a pallet of bricks or a concrete block) near the source to protect recovery workers.|$|E
50|$|External beam {{radiotherapy}} (EBRT) or teletherapy is {{the most}} common form of radiotherapy (radiation therapy). The patient sits or lies on a couch and an external source of ionizing radiation is pointed at a particular part of the body. In contrast to brachytherapy (<b>sealed</b> <b>source</b> radiotherapy) and unsealed source radiotherapy, in which the radiation source is inside the body, external beam radiotherapy directs the radiation at the tumour from outside the body. Orthovoltage ("superficial") X-rays are used for treating skin cancer and superficial structures. Megavoltage ("deep") X-rays are used to treat deep-seated tumours (e.g. bladder, bowel, prostate, lung, or brain).|$|E

40|$|<b>Sealed</b> {{radioactive}} <b>sources</b> {{are used}} in medicine, industry and research {{for a wide range}} of purposes. They can contain different radionuclides in greatly varying amounts. At the end of their useful lives, they are termed 'disused sources' but their activity levels can still be quite high. They are, for all practical purposes, another type of radioactive waste that needs to be disposed of safely. Disused <b>sealed</b> radioactive <b>sources</b> can represent a significant hazard to people if not managed properly. Many countries have no special facilities for the management or disposal of radioactive waste, as they have no nuclear power programmes requiring such facilities. Even in countries with developed nuclear programmes, disused <b>sealed</b> <b>sources</b> present problems as they often fall outside the common categories of radioactive waste for which disposal options have been identified. As a result, many disused <b>sealed</b> <b>sources</b> are kept in storage. Depending on the nature of the storage arrangements, this situation may represent a high potential risk to workers and to the public. The IAEA has received numerous requests for assistance from Member States faced with the problem of safely managing disused <b>sealed</b> <b>sources.</b> The requests have related to both technical and safety aspects. Particularly urgent requests have involved emergency situations arising from unsafe storage conditions and lost sources. There is therefore an important requirement for the development of safe and cost-effective final disposal solutions. Consequently, a number of activities have been initiated by the IAEA to assist Member States in the management of disused <b>sealed</b> <b>sources.</b> The objective of this report is to address safety issues relevant to the disposal of disused <b>sealed</b> <b>sources,</b> and other limited amounts of radioactive waste, in borehole facilities. It is the first in a series of reports aiming to provide an indication of the present issues related to the use of borehole disposal facilities to safely disp radioactive sources and other smaller quantities of radioactive waste and to identify areas were further work needs to be undertaken. This report discusses the general considerations related to the safe disposal of disused <b>sealed</b> <b>sources,</b> and other limited quantities of radioactive waste, in boreholes facilities. It is particularly aimed at Member States who do not plan to develop other types of disposal facility for nuclear fuel cycle waste. It is recognized that internationally agreed safety guidance is needed in this area but further development and consultation is required to establish broad international consensus on the appropriate technology and safety requirement...|$|R
40|$|Many <b>sealed</b> <b>sources</b> {{containing}} americium and beryllium {{are used}} throughout construction, industry, and research, and will eventually require disposal. For planning purposes {{it is necessary}} to determine whether these sources, when disposed, constitute a mixed waste, i. e., a waste containing hazardous constituents regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and radioactive constituents regulated under the Atomic Energy Act. Waste designation criteria contained in 40 CFR 261 are evaluated in detail in this report. It is determined that discarded americium/beryllium <b>sealed</b> <b>sources</b> do not contain any wastes listed in Subpart D of 40 CFR 261, nor do the discarded sources exhibit any hazardous characteristics.

The use of <b>sealed</b> <b>sources</b> removes almost all risk of dispersion of radioactive material into the environment due to mishandling, but the container {{is not intended to}} attenuate radiation, so further shielding is required for radiation protection. <b>Sealed</b> <b>sources</b> are used in almost all applications where the source {{does not need to be}} chemically or physically included in a liquid or gas.|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} few years, the {{utilization}} of <b>sealed</b> <b>source</b> for medical, industrial and research purposes has shown an accelerating increase.

During its use, a sealed radioactive waste will eventually become either a spent <b>sealed</b> <b>source</b> or disused sealed radioactive source (DSRS), due to certain factors. The reduction of the amount of radioactive waste can be executed through the application of reuse and recycle of <b>sealed</b> <b>source.</b> The reuse and recycle policy for spent and disused sealed sources are not already specified yet.
