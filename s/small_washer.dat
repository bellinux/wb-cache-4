2500|$|Smooth rotor disks were {{originally}} proposed, but these gave poor starting torque. [...] Tesla subsequently discovered that smooth rotor disks with <b>small</b> <b>washers</b> bridging the disks in ~12–24 {{places around the}} perimeter of a 10″ disk and a second ring of 6–12 washers at a sub-diameter made for a significant improvement in starting torque, without compromising efficiency.|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} was undertaken primarily {{to examine the}} possibility of hearing damage from industrial ultrasonic equipment. In the factory concerned, ultrasonic washers and drills were used {{at a number of}} different locations, and girls working 12 ft (3 · 6 m.) away from one bank of three <b>small</b> <b>washers</b> complained of unpleasant subjective effects which included fatigue, persistent headaches, nausea, and tinnitus...|$|R

5000|$|An {{interesting}} {{fact is that}} Kymco's 2010 Quannon Naked's 37MM {{front fork}} assembly can be nearly directly transplanted on Taiwan made NSR's {{with the help of}} a <b>small</b> CNC-ed <b>washer,</b> directly addressing the problem with [...] "head float" [...] under hard acceleration and stability at higher speeds.|$|R
50|$|The depot is small, {{with six}} long sidings to store High Speed Trains and Voyagers, and four smaller sidings. If the longer sidings are all used up, trains are stored at Laira TMD, Plymouth, {{and then make}} their way to Penzance railway station in the morning. The depot also has a fuel lane, a single-tracked modern {{maintenance}} shed, and a <b>small</b> carriage <b>washer.</b> A few years ago, facilities at Penzance TMD were expanded to cater for the new fleet of Voyagers used by CrossCountry.|$|R
50|$|There is {{also the}} storm door and screen door {{variation}} of the door closer: As the name implies, these piston shaped closers are used on storm, security, and screen doors which give the home an extra {{line of defense against}} weather, intruders, and insects. Whereas interior closers typically use hydraulics, storm door closers are more typically pneumatic, using air and springs to close the door. Storm Door closers generally have a <b>small</b> metal <b>washer</b> on the rod that is used to lock the closer in the open position when moving stuff in or out, but more recent models such as the Touch 'n Hold door closer have a button to actuate the hold open feature to make this process easier.|$|R
40|$|Root {{vegetables}} like carrot, raddish etc. {{need to be}} pre cleaned before transporting {{from field}} to market. At present there is no primary processing equipment like vegetable <b>washers</b> available for <b>small</b> farmers. A batch type, <b>small</b> vegetable <b>washer</b> with holding capacity 10 kg was developed for washing root vegetables like carrot and raddish. The washer consists of a detopper, a stainless steel washing drum, centre shaft with holes for water spraying etc. The washing drum was provided with different matting namely 5 mm thickness rubber, 1. 5 and 3. 5 mm thickness plastic, respectively for effective cleaning of the vegetables. Performance trials showed that, the washing and cleaning efficiencies were 97 and 91 % for carrot and 96 and 90 % for raddish, respectively using 3. 5 mm thickness plastic matting...|$|R
50|$|National Lockwasher owned U.S. Patent 1,655,018, which covered split-ring, compression-spring {{lock washers}} with a {{construction}} {{preventing them from}} interlinking with one another when handled in bulk. The washer accomplishes this by making the helical ring-shaped washer extend more than 360 degrees in circumference, cutting {{the ends of the}} washer so that the end faces make an angle with the top and bottom faces of the washer, and making the spaces between the ends of the <b>washer</b> <b>smaller</b> than the thickness of the washer stock but large enough to allow compression to flatten the washer. (If the space is smaller than the thickness (cross-section height) of the washer stock, one washer cannot pass through the end space of another washer and entangle it.) A lock washer is used to prevent a screw, bolt, or nut from loosening under vibration. It operates as a spring under compression having sufficient elasticity to neutralize the play between the assembled parts that vibration causes.|$|R
50|$|A blender {{consists}} of a housing, motor, blades, and food container. A fan-cooled electric motor is secured into the housing by way of vibration dampers, and a small output shaft penetrates the upper housing and meshes with the blade assembly. Usually, a <b>small</b> rubber <b>washer</b> provides a seal around the output shaft to prevent liquid from entering the motor. Most blenders today have multiple speeds. As a typical blender has no gearbox, the multiple speeds are often implemented using a universal motor with multiple stator windings and/or multi-tapped stator windings; in a blender with electromechanical controls, the button (or other electrical switching device or position) for each different speed connects a different stator winding/tap or combination thereof. Each different combination of energized windings produces a different torque from the motor, which yields a different equilibrium speed in balance against the drag (resistance to rotation) of the blade assembly {{in contact with the}} material inside the food container. A notable exception from the mid-1960s is the Oster Model 412 Classic VIII (with the single knob) providing the lowest speed (Stir) using the aforementioned winding tap method but furnishing higher speeds (the continuously variable higher speed range is marked Puree to Liquify) by means of a mechanical speed governor that balances the force provided by flyweights against a spring force varied by the control knob when it is switched into the higher speed range. With this arrangement, when not set to the Stir speed, motor speed is constant even with varying load up to the point where power demanded by the load is equal to the motor's power capability at a particular speed. The more modern version of this arrangement is electronic speed control found on some units.|$|R
5000|$|The Zip drive {{had a very}} {{low-cost}} {{and revolutionary}} linear actuator to move the read/write {{head back and forth}} on the Zip disk media. This actuator slid back and forth on a single thin steel rod using two sleeve bearings. Under normal drive use, the actuator was under the servo control of the drive. If the drive had its power removed inadvertently by being unplugged or power outage, the read/write heads were pulled off the disk by a power-loss circuit. This was to prevent damage by the heads being left on the media. When the actuator was removed in this manner, it slammed to a stop at the end of its travel. This violent stopping of the actuator could damage the fragile suspension system of the read/write head. To protect from this damage, the drive designers placed a <b>small</b> doughnut-shaped foam <b>washer</b> at the end of the thin steel bearing the actuator slid on. A cost reduction effort within Iomega manufacturing decided that to reduce cost, they would remove this part. Zip drives that followed for a several month period exhibited the click of death. This omission was discovered by the drive's original designers and the washer was put back into the design, and new Zip drives did not experience this click of death.|$|R
40|$|Vision-based {{robotics}} is an {{ever-growing field}} within industrial automation. Demands for greater flexibility and higher quality motivate manufacturing companies to adopt these technologies for such tasks as material handling, assembly, and inspection. Manufacturing systems, {{as well as}} their control mechanism, are typically modeled as discrete event systems, and off-the-shelf PLC hardware is used for realization of sequential control systems. However, with introduction of robots and machine vision solutions, it becomes harder to reason about the combined systems collectively. Vi- sion algorithms require complex processing, and imaging setups have to be accurately calibrated with respect to other active systems such as robots, sensors, and material handling equipment. This thesis considers the application area of machine vision, and particularly vi- sual metrology systems, from the perspective of being a part of larger cyber-physical systems. This includes, in addition to the traditional computer vision algorithms and estimation methods, considerations of distributed system architecture and behavioral characteristics expressed with discrete event semantics. The ultimate goal is to make the first steps towards a theory backing control of visually-guided event-based be- haviors in industrial robotic and automation systems. The thesis approaches the goal by a combination of laboratory results, case study of an industrial company, and formalization of modeling abstractions and archi- tectural solutions. The practical results include a method for image analysis of star <b>washers</b> (<b>small</b> automotive parts), a feature engineering technique and machine learning experiments for classification of star washers’ orientation on a feeder, and a probabilistic analysis of the camera calibration process. In addition, to model and implement industrial vision systems in event-driven environment, a formalism of Discrete Event Data Flow is formulated, and the EPypes software framework is developed...|$|R
