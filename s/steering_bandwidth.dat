40|$|This {{research}} paper explores how different drug mechanisms {{within a single}} class of drugs can produces different profiles of driving impairment. Prior research has failed to consider these mechanistic differences and often utilizes less controlled study methodologies. The potential impact of differing mechanistic effects is important for practitioners but remains unclear for most drugs. Twentynine licensed drivers in good general health completed one of two miniSim™ studies using a validated, standardized, driving impairment scenario. Both drugs caused degradation in lateral control measures of standard deviation of lane position (SDLP) and number of lane departures, however only diphenhydramine was found to cause {{a significant change in}} <b>steering</b> <b>bandwidth.</b> The studied drugs differed in their effects on all longitudinal driving measures with diphenhydramine effecting speed and alprazolam effecting the standard deviation of speed. Difference in therapeutic mechanism of action results in differing pharmacodynamic driving performance outcomes. This analysis reinforces the importance of careful consideration of a drug’s specific mechanism of action when considering a sedating drug’s impact on a patient’s ability to safely operate a motor vehicle...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – Background: A {{principal}} design {{choice in}} providing steering wheel force feedback to assist drivers during lane-keeping is whether feedback {{should be provided}} for any error {{with respect to the}} lane centre (continuous feedback) or only when acceptable tolerance limits are exceeded (bandwidth feedback). Problem: Research has shown that continuously assisting the driver by means of steering wheel force feedback improves driver performance and reduces mental workload. However, {{it has been suggested that}} continuous feedback induces aftereffects during subsequent manual driving. Method: In a fixed-base driving simulator study, we evaluated driver performance and mental workload, while drivers (n= 32) received corrective force feedback on the steering wheel. Five designs were compared, namely no feedback (Manual), discrete bandwidth feedback (Band 1), bandwidth feedback with a hysteresis filter (Band 2), continuous feedback with feedback gain used in earlier studies (Cont), and continuous feedback with a feedback gain twice as strong (ContS). While driving the participants performed a secondary peripheral detection task. Participants were told that the feedback was not fully reliable. Towards the end of the trajectory the feedback algorithm was shut down in order to investigate short-term aftereffects. After each trial the participant would fill out a NASA-TLX and a Vanderlaan-questionnaire to measure workload, usefulness and satisfaction. Results: All four feedback designs eliminated the large lane centre deviations that occasionally occur during manual control. Both continuous feedback designs yielded smaller lane centre errors than bandwidth feedback and manual control. Shortly after the feedback was shut down, ContS resulted in worse lane keeping performance than Manual and bandwidth feedback. The secondary task showed a lower reaction time for Cont compared to Band 1 and the NASA-TLX indicated lower workload for continuous feedback compared to manual control. The satisfaction scale of the Vanderlaan-questionnaire showed a significantly higher score for Cont compared to Band 1. When the feedback shut down, drivers supported by ContS showed a lower minimum TLC, higher mean and maximum absolute lateral error, and more near lane departures. Conclusions: Providing the driver with continuous feedback is an effective way to improve the lane keeping performance and is experienced by drivers as more satisfactory and intuitive, as compared to bandwidth force feedback and manual <b>steering.</b> <b>Bandwidth</b> feedback is equally effective in preventing excessive deviation from the lane centre and did not suffer from the aftereffects that the ContS system did. Stronger continuous feedback resulted in better lane keeping performance, but also in larger aftereffects. The Cont design had a good performance, was perceived as satisfactory and showed no significant short-term aftereffects. Nevertheless, future research should point out if long-term behavioural adaptations lead to stronger aftereffects for continuous systems.

40|$|Automobile {{drivers are}} {{regularly}} exposed to vibrational stimuli in their vehicle. Of the automobile subsystems, {{the steering wheel}} {{is one of the}} most important due to its role in controlling the vehicle. In particular, the steering wheel plays an important role in transmitting information about the road and about the vehicle to the driver. This paper investigates the effect of steering system feedback gain and <b>steering</b> system feedback <b>bandwidth</b> on the human interpretation of the driving information transmitted by the steering wheel. Human recognition of road surface type was found to be highly dependent on the feedback gain and the feedback <b>bandwidth</b> of the <b>steering</b> wheel vibration.

40|$|Abstract—A {{multichannel}} terrain observation by progressive scans (TOPS) {{synthetic aperture}} radar (SAR) system is capa-ble of imaging a wider swath with a higher azimuth resolution for improved moving target detection. For TOPS SAR, due to antenna beam <b>steering,</b> the azimuth <b>bandwidth</b> of background clutter is {{much larger than the}} instantaneous signal bandwidth. To overcome this problem, a method referred to as spectrum compression space–time adaptive processing (SC-STAP) is pro-posed in this letter. Through the SC process, both the Doppler spectrum and the spatial spectrum of the background clutter are simultaneously compressed. This key step achieves fully over-lapped clutter space–time spectrum lines and, as such, enables effective clutter suppression and target signal alias compensation by applying linearly constrained STAP. Furthermore, {{in order to avoid the}} target ambiguities arising from the spectral wrapping, an approach based on deramp processing is proposed to focus the moving targets for TOPS SAR mode. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

40|$|Works on pico-satellites {{have gained}} {{momentum}} recently, {{especially those that}} consider pico-satellites {{as part of a}} much larger constellation or swarm. This feature allows pico-satellites to provide high temporal resolution of observational data and redundancy. In particular, it reduces the need for satellite-to-ground communications and, hence, helps save energy and allows the execution of distributed processing algorithms on the satellites themselves. Consequently, satellite-to-satellite or cross-link communication is critical. To realize these advantages, the cross-link antenna employed on pico-satellites must meet many criteria, namely, small size, lightweight, low-power consumption, high gain, wide bandwidth, circular polarization, and beam steerability. To date, no works have examined the suitability of existing planar antenna designs for the use on pico-satellites. To this end, this paper contributes to the literature by focusing on microstrip patch and slot antennas that have the ability to achieve high gain, beam <b>steering,</b> and wide <b>bandwidth.</b> This paper reviews 66 planar antenna designs, which includes 38 -patch and 28 -slot antennas. In addition, we provide an extensive qualitative comparison of these antennas in terms of their mass, size, gain, beam steerability, type of polarization, operating frequency band, and return loss. In addition, we have evaluated three antenna designs that best address the pico-satellite challenges on a common platform. We find that the asymmetric E-shaped patch antenna design is the most suitable for the use on 2 U CubeSats. This is because of its small size ($ 34 times 13 $ mm $^{ 2 }) $ and high gain (7. 3 dB). In addition, the E-shaped patch antenna yields a wide − 10 -dB bandwidth of 2300 MHz and a small return loss of − 15. 2 dB...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} two high bandwidth short-stroke rotary fast tool servos and the hybrid rotary/linear electromagnetic actuator developed for one of them. Design insights, trade-off methodologies, and analytical tools are developed for precision mechanical systems, power and signal electronic systems, control systems, normal-stress electromagnetic actuators, and {{the dynamics of the}} combined systems. A fast tool servo (FTS) is a high-speed auxiliary servo axis that is added to a diamond turning machine (ultra-precision lathe) to allow generating free-form non-axisymmetric or textured surfaces on a workpiece. A rotary fast tool servo produces an in-and-out motion of the tool relative to a workpiece by swinging the tool along an arc having a fixed radius. The rotary fast tool servos developed in this project were designed for diamond turning prescription textured surfaces on small spherical workpieces (diameters in the range of 10 mm or less), and are suitable for generating free-form non-axisymmetric surfaces on similar-sized workpieces. Straightforward modifications would allow them to be used on larger workpieces. These rotary fast tool servos set new benchmarks for demonstrated closed-loop bandwidth (2 kHz and 10 kHz) and tool tip acceleration (400 g). (cont.) The first machine, referred to as the 2 kHz rotary fast tool servo, uses a commercially available moving-magnet galvanometer as the actuator (Lorentz force), and provides proof-of-principles for a flexure bearing, small diamond tool and mounting method, circuit topology for a high bandwidth current-mode amplifier, and control system design. The following closed-loop performance is demonstrated for the 2 kHz rotary fast tool servo: - 3 dB bandwidth of 2 kHz, 20 g tool tip acceleration at 2 kHz, maximum tool travel of 50 [mu]m PP, and tool position noise level of 10 nm PP. The 2 kHz FTS is integrated with a diamond turning machine and used to produce optical quality textured surfaces on the face and outside diameter of aluminum workpieces while operating at 2 kHz. The machining tests validate that a rotary-type fast tool servo can be used to produce optical quality surfaces on a spherical workpiece from its pole to its equator. The second machine, referred to as the 10 kHz rotary fast tool servo, incorporates the proof-of-principles from the first machine and is the vehicle for developing the hybrid rotary/linear electromagnetic actuator used in it. (cont.) The actuator is a normal-stress variable reluctance machine with a demonstrated order of magnitude increase in the peak torque and in the ratio of peak torque divided by the electrical power at its terminals, when compared to the actuator used in the 2 kHz FTS. By integrating the tool holder directly to the moving mass of the actuator to form a single rigid body, the overall torque-to-inertia ratio for the system and the frequency of the first uncoupled-mass resonance are both increased. The following closed-loop performance is demonstrated for the 10 kHz rotary fast tool servo: - 3 dB bandwidth of 10 kHz, 400 g tool tip acceleration at 5 kHz, 870 g tool tip acceleration at 10 kHz (aided by a stable mechanical resonance), maximum tool travel of 70 [mu]m PP, and tool position noise level of 1. 4 to 2. 5 nm rms (depending on the magnitude of the bias flux used). The hybrid rotary/linear electromagnetic actuator utilizes a constant bias magnetic flux, which linearizes the torque versus drive-current relationship for the actuator and provides up to half of the torque-producing magnetic flux in the rotor/stator air gaps. The actuator is similar to the rotary actuators used to drive and sustain a resonance in a mechanical oscillator in certain electric engraving heads. (cont.) This research is distinguished from the prior art by the ability to generate closed-loop arbitrary trajectories for the tool tip. Using a separate current-mode amplifier for each stator half allows demonstrating closed-loop control of the rotary and linear degrees of freedom that are inherent in this class of actuators. This research is further distinguished from the prior art by a magnetic circuit that substantially decouples certain magnetic flux paths when a coil is used instead of a permanent magnet to provide the bias magnetic flux. This reduces the complexity of the actuator electrical dynamics from a MIMO system to a SISO system, and allows using loop-shaping techniques with classical control theory to design the control systems. Torque control for the hybrid rotary/linear actuator in the 10 kHz FTS is independent of force control, but force control requires a torque-generating current to act as an operating point. Alternate magnetic circuit topologies that fully decouple torque and force control are described and compared. Future work that utilizes the linear mode as an active suspension for improving the performance of a predominantly rotary system is considered. Using the experience gained by designing, building, and testing the 10 kHz FTS and hybrid rotary/linear actuator, future work involving alternate concepts for the actuator is suggested for a follow-on rotary fast tool servo, and a high <b>bandwidth</b> <b>steering</b> mirror. by Richard Clement Montesanti.
