40|$|The requirements, design, and {{performance}} of a centrifugal regulator aimed at limiting deployment rates of deployable elements are discussed. The overall mechanism is comprised of four distinct functional parts in a machined housing: (1) the centrifugal brake device, which checks the payout of a deployment cable; (2) the <b>reducing</b> <b>gear,</b> which produces the spin rate necesary for the braking device; (3) the payout device, which allows the unwinding of the cable; and (4) the locking device, which prevents untimely unwinding. The centrifugal regulator is set into operation by a threshold tension of the cable which unlocks the mechanism and allows unwinding. The pulley of the windout device drives the centrifugal brake {{with the help of}} the <b>reducing</b> <b>gear.</b> The centrifugal force pushes aside weights that produce friction of the studs in a cylindrical housing. The mechanism behaved well at qualification temperature and vibrations...|$|R

In this research the experimental work is carried out to study the effect of planet phasing on noise and subsequent resulting vibrations of Nylon- 6 planetary gear drive. For this purpose experimental set-up was built and trials were conducted for two different arrangements (i. e., with phasing and without phasing) and it is observed that the noise level and resulting vibrations were reduced by planet phasing arrangement. So from the experimental results it is observed that by applying the meshing phase difference one can <b>reduce</b> planetary <b>gear</b> set noise and vibrations...|$|R
