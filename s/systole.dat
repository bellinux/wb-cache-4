5|$|Afterload, or {{how much}} {{pressure}} the heart must generate to eject blood at <b>systole,</b> is influenced by vascular resistance. It can be influenced by narrowing of the heart valves (stenosis) or contraction or relaxation of the peripheral blood vessels.|$|E
5|$|Several imaging {{methods can}} be used to assess the anatomy and {{function}} of the heart, including ultrasound (echocardiography), angiography, CT scans, MRI and PET. An echocardiogram is an ultrasound of the heart used to measure the heart's function, assess for valve disease, and look for any abnormalities. Echocardiography can be conducted by a probe on the chest ("transthoracic") or by a probe in the esophagus ("transoesophageal"). A typical echocardiography report will include information about the width of the valves noting any stenosis, whether there is any backflow of blood (regurgitation) and information about the blood volumes at the end of <b>systole</b> and diastole, including an ejection fraction, which describes how much blood is ejected from the left and right ventricles after <b>systole.</b> Ejection fraction can then be obtained by dividing the volume ejected by the heart (stroke volume) by the volume of the filled heart (end-diastolic volume). Echocardiograms can also be conducted under circumstances when the body is more stressed, in order to examine for signs of lack of blood supply. This cardiac stress test involves either direct exercise, or where this is not possible, injection of a drug such as dobutamine.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the cardiac cycle, in early diastole, both the atria and ventricles are relaxed. Since blood moves from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, when the chambers are relaxed, blood will flow into the atria (through the coronary sinus and the pulmonary veins). As the atria begin to fill, the pressure will rise so that the blood will move from the atria into the ventricles. In late diastole the atria contract, pumping more blood into the ventricles. This causes a rise in pressure in the ventricles. As the ventricles reach <b>systole,</b> blood will be pumped into the pulmonary artery (right ventricle) or aorta (left ventricle).|$|E

5|$|Perforator veins play a {{very special}} role in the venous system, {{carrying}} blood from superficial to deep veins. During the muscular <b>systole</b> their valves close and stop any blood flow coming from the deep to the superficial veins. When their valves become insufficient, {{they are responsible for}} a rapid deterioration in existing varicose disease and for the development of venous ulcers. Detection of insufficient perforators is important because they need to be ligatured. However, the detection of competent ones is as important because they may be used strategically in new techniques of conservative surgery, for example a minimally invasive CHIVA. The ultrasonography report will include insufficient and continent perforators, which will also be shown on venous mapping. To test these veins properly, the examiner will need to use some techniques like the Paraná maneuver, toe and foot flexion, and hyper-extension on tip toes.|$|E
25|$|Ejection {{fraction}} (EF) is a parameter {{related to}} SV. EF is {{the fraction of}} blood ejected by the left ventricle (LV) during the contraction or ejection phase of the cardiac cycle or <b>systole.</b> Prior {{to the start of}} <b>systole,</b> during the filling phase or diastole, the LV is filled with blood to the capacity known as end diastolic volume (EDV). During <b>systole,</b> the LV contracts and ejects blood until it reaches its minimum capacity known as end systolic volume (ESV). It does not completely empty. The following equations help translate the effect of EF and EDV on cardiac output Q, via SV.|$|E

25|$|Some squamate species (e.g., pythons {{and monitor}} lizards) have three-chambered hearts that become {{functionally}} four-chambered hearts during contraction. This {{is made possible}} by a muscular ridge that subdivides the ventricle during ventricular diastole and completely divides it during ventricular <b>systole.</b> Because of this ridge, some of these squamates are capable of producing ventricular pressure differentials that are equivalent to those seen in mammalian and avian hearts.|$|E
25|$|The {{coronary}} circulation system provides a blood {{supply to the}} heart muscle itself. The {{coronary circulation}} begins near {{the origin of the}} aorta by two coronary arteries: the right coronary artery and the left coronary artery. After nourishing the heart muscle, blood returns through the coronary veins into the coronary sinus and from this one into the right atrium. Back flow of blood through its opening during atrial <b>systole</b> is prevented by the Thebesian valve. The smallest cardiac veins drain directly into the heart chambers.|$|E
25|$|It {{turns out}} that the minimal entropy of a closed surface can be related to its optimal {{systolic}} ratio. Namely, there is an upper bound for the entropy of a systolically extremal surface, in terms of its <b>systole.</b> By combining this upper bound with Katok's optimal lower bound in terms of the volume, one obtains a simpler alternative proof of Gromov's asymptotic estimate for the optimal systolic ratio of surfaces of large genus. Furthermore, such an approach yields an improved multiplicative constant in Gromov's theorem.|$|E

25|$|Findings on {{clinical}} examination {{depend on the}} severity and duration of MI. The mitral component of the first heart sound is usually soft and with a laterally displaced apex beat, often with heave. The first heart sound {{is followed by a}} high-pitched holosystolic murmur at the apex, radiating to the back or clavicular area. Its duration is, as the name suggests, the whole of <b>systole.</b> The loudness of the murmur does not correlate well with the severity of regurgitation. It may be followed by a loud, palpable P2, heard best when lying on the left side. A third heart sound is commonly heard.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} of aortic insufficiency (AI), comprises {{the pressure in}} the left ventricle falling below the pressure in the aorta, the aortic valve {{is not able to}} completely close. This causes a leaking of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle. This means that some of the blood that was already ejected from the heart is regurgitating back into the heart. The percentage of blood that regurgitates back through the aortic valve due to AI is known as the regurgitant fraction. This regurgitant flow causes a decrease in the diastolic blood pressure in the aorta, and therefore an increase in the pulse pressure. Since some of the blood that is ejected during <b>systole</b> regurgitates back into the left ventricle during diastole, there is decreased effective forward flow in AI.|$|E
500|$|The {{cardiac cycle}} {{refers to a}} {{complete}} heartbeat which includes <b>systole</b> and diastole and the intervening pause. The cycle begins with contraction of the atria and ends with relaxation of the ventricles. [...] <b>Systole</b> refers to contraction of the atria or ventricles of the heart. Diastole is when the atria or ventricles relax and fill with blood. The atria and ventricles work in concert, so in <b>systole</b> when the ventricles are contracting, the atria are relaxed and collecting blood. When the ventricles are relaxed in diastole, the atria contract to pump blood to the ventricles. This coordination ensures blood is pumped efficiently to the body.|$|E
