5|$|The Pairan aliens were {{designed}} by the prominent avant-garde artist Tarō Okamoto, which used a <b>single</b> <b>eye</b> that is common among science fiction aliens. Although official film posters showed the Pairan aliens towering over buildings, the actual cinematic version of the aliens were {{on the scale of}} humans, at about two meters. Walt Lee reports that Gentaro Nakajima's novel, on which this film was based, was in turn based on the Japanese folktale Kaguya-hime. The film was one of fourteen Japanese color pictures produced in early 1956, but the first color Japanese science-fiction film.|$|E
25|$|Hooks are {{designed}} as either single hooks—a <b>single</b> <b>eye,</b> shank and point; double hooks—a <b>single</b> <b>eye</b> merged with two shanks and points; or triple—a <b>single</b> <b>eye</b> merged with three shanks and three evenly spaced points. Double hooks are formed {{from a single}} piece of wire and {{may or may not have}} their shanks brazed together for strength. Triple hooks are formed by adding a single eyeless hook to a double hook and brazing all three shanks together. Double hooks are used on some artificial lures and are a traditional fly hook for Atlantic Salmon flies, but are otherwise fairly uncommon. Triple hooks are used on all sorts of artificial lures as well as for a wide variety of bait applications.|$|E
25|$|Posterior keratoconus, a {{distinct}} disorder despite its similar name, {{is a rare}} abnormality, usually congenital, which causes a nonprogressive thinning of the inner surface of the cornea, while the curvature of the anterior surface remains normal.

25|$|The main {{sense of}} {{barnacles}} {{appears to be}} touch, with the hairs on the limbs being especially sensitive. The adult also has a <b>single</b> <b>eye,</b> although this is probably only capable of sensing the difference between light and dark. This eye {{is derived from the}} primary naupliar eye.|$|E
25|$|Amblyopia, {{also called}} lazy eye, is a {{disorder}} of sight {{due to the}} eye and brain not working well together. It results in decreased vision in an eye that otherwise typically appears normal. It {{is the most common}} cause of decreased vision in a <b>single</b> <b>eye</b> among children and younger adults.|$|E
25|$|The mouth {{parts of}} mites may be adapted for biting, stinging, sawing or sucking. They breathe through tracheae, stigmata (small {{openings}} of the skin), intestines {{and the skin}} itself. Species hunting for other mites have very acute senses, but many mites are eyeless. The central eyes of arachnids are always missing, or they are fused into a <b>single</b> <b>eye.</b> Thus, any eye number from none to five may occur.|$|E

25|$|Athena {{instructed}} Perseus to {{find the}} Hesperides, who were entrusted with weapons needed to defeat the Gorgon. Following Athena's guidance, Perseus sought the Graeae, sisters of the Gorgons, to demand the whereabouts of the Hesperides, the nymphs tending Hera's orchard. The Graeae were three perpetually old women, who had to share a <b>single</b> <b>eye.</b> As the women passed the eye from one to another, Perseus snatched it from them, holding it for ransom {{in return for the}} location of the nymphs. When the sisters led him to the Hesperides, he returned what he had taken.|$|E
25|$|Materials : Early {{windlasses}} were individually hand forged from {{a single}} piece of wrought iron by a blacksmith. More modern techniques include casting of iron or bronze, drop forging and (the most common technique) welding. Some boatmen had their windlasses 'silvered' (or chrome plated) for increased comfort and to prevent rusting. Windlasses are now only rarely plated, but a popular modern choice of metal is aluminium, whose smooth and rustproof surface has the same advantages of longevity and blister-reduction, and is also very light. One type of these, the Dunton Double, has only a <b>single</b> <b>eye,</b> but by clever tapering it will operate either size of spindle.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} phase of the story, Horus competes with Set for the kingship. Their {{struggle}} encompasses {{a great number of}} separate episodes and ranges in character from violent conflict to a legal judgment by the assembled gods. In one important episode, Set tears out one or both of Horus' eyes, which are later restored by the healing efforts of Thoth or Hathor. For this reason, the Eye of Horus is a prominent symbol of life and well-being in Egyptian iconography. Because Horus is a sky god, with one eye equated with the sun and the other with the moon, the destruction and restoration of the <b>single</b> <b>eye</b> explains why the moon is less bright than the sun.|$|E

25|$|The Predator was {{originally}} designed {{with a long}} neck, a dog-like head and a <b>single</b> <b>eye.</b> This design was abandoned when {{it became apparent that}} the jungle locations would make shooting the complex design too difficult. Originally, the studio contracted the makeup effects for the alien from Richard Edlund's Boss Film Creature Shop. However, problems filming the alien in Mexico led the makeup effects responsibilities to be given to Stan Winston. According to former Boss Films make-up supervisor Steve Johnson, the makeup failed because of an impractical design by McTiernan that included 12-inch length extensions that gave the Predator a backward bent satyr-leg. The design did not work in the jungle locations. After six weeks of shooting in the jungles of Palenque, Mexico, the production had to shut down so that Winston could make a new Predator. This took eight months and then filming resumed for five weeks, ending in February 1987.|$|E
500|$|Opabinia {{looked so}} strange that the {{audience}} at the first presentation of Whittington's analysis laughed. The length of Opabinia regalis from head to tail ranged between [...] and [...] The animal also had a hollow proboscis, whose total length was {{about one-third of the}} body's and projected down from under the head and then curved forwards and upwards. The proboscis was [...] like a vacuum cleaner's hose and probably flexible, and it ended with a claw-like structure whose inner edges bore spines that projected inwards and forwards. The head bore five eyes: two on stalks near the front and fairly close {{to the middle of the}} head, pointing upwards and forwards; two larger eyes, also stalked, near the rear and outer edges of the head, pointing upwards and sideways; and a <b>single</b> <b>eye</b> with a shorter stalk between the larger pair of stalked eyes, pointing upwards. It has been assumed that the eyes were all compound, like arthropods' lateral eyes, but this reconstruction, which is not backed up by any evidence, is [...] "somewhat fanciful". The mouth was under the head, behind the proboscis, and pointed backwards, so that the digestive tract formed a U-bend on its way towards the rear of the animal. The proboscis appeared sufficiently long and flexible to reach the mouth.|$|E
500|$|For Bloodstone and Bloodlust, Wayne Toth and Norman Cabrera came {{on board}} to create the special make-up effects for the films; they also pulled double duty {{composing}} and performing the music, alongside Romanian musicians, {{for a portion of}} Bloodstone. The limited budget that Toth and Cabrera had to work forced them to use any location they could find in order to apply the make-up to the actors, as they did not have a separate workstation. Make-up trailers would be created in local resident's homes, cave openings, inside of cars, or just sitting {{on the side of the}} road. To create Radu's face, Toth and Cabrera applied four separate prosthetic pieces to Anders Hove's forehead, left and right cheek, and his chin. A cosmetic make-up is applied over his entire face to help conceal those four prosthetics. This was the same process used in the original Subspecies film, although Toth and Cabrera admit to tweaking the coloring of Radu's skin. One major change to the make-up process was to Radu's hands. In the original film, Hove had to wear individual appliances on each of his fingers, but to cut back on the time needed to apply the make-up, Toth and Cabrera created a pair of prosthetic gloves that Hove could slip on his hands. For [...] "Mummy", Radu's sorceress mother, a headpiece was cast from Pamela Gordon, which included her shoulders as well. After the make-up was applied to give the cast a [...] "dry" [...] and [...] "mummified" [...] appearance, it was slipped over Gordon's head leaving only her face showing. From there, Toth and Cabrera applied a separate face prosthetic. The facial appliance gave Gordon near zero visibility, having only a <b>single</b> <b>eye</b> slit for her left eye. The crew had to escort her around sets so that she would not injure herself. Gordon was given a pair of dentures to wear, as well as some prosthetic gloves similar to what Hove wore. The rest of Gordon's body was draped in clothing to conceal it.|$|E

2500|$|Copepods are a {{group of}} tiny {{crustaceans}} found in the sea and lakes. Many species are planktonic (drifting in sea waters), and others are benthic (living on the ocean floor). Copepods are typically [...] long, with a teardrop shaped body and large antennae. Although like other crustaceans they have an armoured exoskeleton, they are so small that in most species this thin armour, and the entire body, is almost totally transparent. Copepods have a compound, median <b>single</b> <b>eye,</b> usually bright red, in {{the centre of the}} transparent head.|$|E
2500|$|The {{chimney swift}} has large, deep set eyes. These are {{protected}} by small patches of coarse, black, bristly feathers, which are located {{in front of each}} eye. The swift can change the angle of these feathers, which may help to reduce glare. It is far-sighted and, like some birds of prey, this swift is bifoveal: each eye having both a temporal and a central fovea.

2500|$|To {{complete}} their lives, tadpole shrimps {{depend on the}} changing nature of the temporary waters they inhabit. During the dry season (summer and fall), their offspring stay inside the eggs. As the pool fills with rainwater during the winter and spring, they hatch and feed on fairy shrimps and other invertebrates. The first larval stage (the metanauplius) is orange in color. It has a <b>single</b> <b>eye,</b> six legs, and develops through instars (growth stages). Each instar ends with shedding the exoskeleton. The number of segments and appendages increases as Triops [...] grow, and they slowly change to greyish brown. In approximately eight days, they reach maturity and lay eggs. Adult Triops die as the pools dry up. Triops generally live for about 20–90 days if the pool does not dry up.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{complementary}} {{theories of}} color vision are the trichromatic {{theory and the}} opponent process theory. The trichromatic theory, or Young–Helmholtz theory, proposed in the 19th century by Thomas Young and Hermann von Helmholtz, as mentioned above, states that the retina's three types of cones are preferentially sensitive to blue, green, and red. Ewald Hering proposed the opponent process theory in 1872. It states that the visual system interprets color in an antagonistic way: red vs. green, blue vs. yellow, black vs. white. [...] Both theories are now accepted as valid, describing different stages in visual physiology, visualized in the diagram on the right. Green←→Magenta and Blue←→Yellow are scales with mutually exclusive boundaries. In {{the same way that}} there cannot exist a [...] "slightly negative" [...] positive number, a <b>single</b> <b>eye</b> cannot perceive a bluish-yellow or a reddish-green. (But such impossible colors can be perceived due to binocular rivalry.) ...|$|E

[...] This method is illustrated in the original Alien vs Predator PC game, and reused for the [...] "Predalien" [...] 28 years later.
