500|$|During the Second World War, {{the federal}} {{government}} built the $50 million Susquehanna Ordnance Depot to make TNT on , partially in the White Deer Hole Creek watershed. In the spring of 1942, residents were evicted by eminent domain from 163 farms and 47 other properties in Gregg Township in Union County and Brady, Clinton, and Washington Townships in Lycoming County. The village of Alvira in Gregg Township disappeared. Alvira was founded in 1825 as [...] "Wisetown" [...] and had 100 inhabitants by 1900. Although the inhabitants were told they could return after the war, almost all the buildings seized were razed. Only some cemeteries and the nearby [...] "Stone Church" [...] remain. Construction of the plant involved some 10,000 people, and it took 3,500 to 4,500 employees to run the plant with its more than 200 buildings and 149 storage bunkers for TNT and high explosives, as well as <b>storage</b> <b>racks</b> of bombs. However, the need for TNT was lower than originally estimated and the project was nearly abandoned. By 1945, the only workers left at the depot were guards.|$|E

2500|$|Longliners – use {{one or more}} long heavy fishing {{lines with}} a series of {{hundreds}} or even thousands of baited hooks hanging from the main line by means of branch lines called [...] "snoods". Hand operated longlining can be operated from boats of any size. The number of hooks and lines [...] handled depends on the size of vessel, the number of crew, and the level of mechanisation. Large purpose built longliners can be designed for single species fisheries such as tuna. On such larger vessels the bridge is usually placed aft, and the gear is hauled from the bow or from the side with mechanical or hydraulic line haulers. The lines are set over the stern. Automatic or semi-automatic systems are used to bait hooks and shoot and haul lines. These systems include rail rollers, line haulers, hook separators, dehookers and hook cleaners, and <b>storage</b> <b>racks</b> or drums. To avoid incidental catches of seabirds, an outboard setting funnel is used to guide the line from the setting position on the stern down to a depth of one or two metres. Small scale longliners handle the gear by hand. The line is stored into baskets or tubs, perhaps using a hand cranked line drum.|$|E
40|$|In routine {{design of}} steel <b>storage</b> <b>rack</b> frames, {{it is far}} more common to perform two {{dimensional}} (2 D) rather than three dimensional (3 D) linear buckling analyses. In this paper, it is demonstrated that the global buckling behavior of high-rise steel <b>storage</b> <b>rack</b> frames may not be revealed by 2 D buckling analyses as 3 D interaction modes are involved. It is shown that the monosymmetric upright columns of a high-rise rack frame fail in a flexural–torsional mode due to the shear-center eccentricity of the sections, and that the 3 D frame buckling analysis is more reliable in determining the critical members of a rack frame. Current steel <b>storage</b> <b>rack</b> design standards combine independent 2 D flexural buckling analyses and simplified flexural–torsional buckling analysis of individual columns to account for 3 D behavior. Comparisons between the buckling stresses of the rack columns determined from 3 D buckling analyses and the buckling stresses determined in accordance with the steel <b>storage</b> <b>racking</b> standards are presented. It is concluded that the use of 2 D analysis based procedures can lead to poorly proportioned pallet rack structures in terms of safety or economy. By comparing the buckling analysis results using 3 D beam elements of varying degrees of refinement to each other, it is also demonstrated that the beam elements available in most commercial frame analysis programs are not sufficiently refined for accurate 3 D buckling analyses of high-rise rack frames composed of monosymmetric thin-walled open sections...|$|R
40|$|In {{existing}} AS/RS research, storage assignment {{policies are}} evaluated {{based on the}} probability that item type j will be stored (and subsequently retrieved). This note applies the turnover-based and class-based assignment policies of Hausman et al. (1976) to a stochastic environment by identifying the kth pallet of item type j: Frequently demanded pallets are stored close to the input/output point and rarely demanded pallets are stored {{at the end of}} the <b>storage</b> <b>rack.</b> We consider a discrete <b>storage</b> <b>rack</b> and a continuous <b>storage</b> <b>rack.</b> For the continuous rack case, we develop an expression for expected one-way travel time given uniform and exponentially distributed demand. We show that the turnover-based policy applied to the stochastic environment is optimal (it minimizes one-way travel time) and that both the turnover-based and class-based assignment policies applied in the stochastic environment reduce expected storage/retrieval time compared with random assignment. These savings can be directly translated into increased throughput capacity for existing systems and can be used to improve the design of proposed systems. Manufacturing, Automated Systems...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} comprehensive studies into locally unstable {{light-gauge steel}} structures. The {{aim of this}} project was to create guidelines {{for the design of}} thin-walled steel structures by analyses which consider the effect of cross-sectional instability. Research was conducted to address the knowledge gap associated with the amplification of second-order effects due to local instabilities, the treatment of imperfections in advanced analysis and the effect of interactive buckling on light gauge steel members. The objectives of this research were achieved through a combination of numerical and experimental investigations using two different types of ultra-light gauge steel <b>storage</b> <b>rack</b> uprights. The first series of experiments investigated the effects of interactive buckling through a number of compression tests on varying lengths of ultra-light gauge steel <b>storage</b> <b>rack</b> uprights. The second experimental investigation was used to study the effects of local instabilities on the second-order effects and behaviour of light gauge steel frames. Fourteen full scale <b>storage</b> <b>rack</b> tests were completed using different combinations of beam depths and nominal horizontal loads. Measured imperfection data and calibrated FE models were then used to determine a rational procedure for implementing geometric imperfections into advanced analysis. Special attention was given to the effect that local instabilities had on the second-order displacements of the frame. Based on both the experimental and numerical studies, recommendations were then provided regarding the effect of interactive buckling, inclusion of imperfections in advanced analysis and the effect that local instabilities have on the second-order displacements and ultimate loads of steel <b>storage</b> <b>rack</b> frames...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAs a new {{generation}} of automated warehousing systems, 3 D compact storage systems have been increasingly installed worldwide for handling inventory items in warehouses, distribution centres and manufacturing factories. Due to the problem complexity and system novelty, research investigating these systems, design models in particular, lags behind. This study, thus, addresses the design of 3 D compact storage systems, where the I/O port is located at the lower mid-point of the <b>storage</b> <b>rack,</b> in attempting to assist practitioners in designing such systems that can achieve optimal performance while meeting system capacity requirements. In view of its importance in system design, we first derive the system expected travel time and subsequently optimise the three dimensions of the <b>storage</b> <b>rack.</b> We consider all the possible configurations of the three rack dimensions and develop closed form expressions for travel time derivation and rack dimension optimisation. We compare the result with an available design model, where the I/O port is located in the lower left-corner of the <b>storage</b> <b>rack.</b> The comparison shows that our model produces shorter system expected travel time, thus higher system throughput. We also elaborate several numerical examples to demonstrate how our model can be applied to design 3 D compact storage systems in practice. Based on the numerical examples, we further provide several managerial implications, which are useful for practitioners to make suitable design decisions...|$|R
