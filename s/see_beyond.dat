25|$|Miss Representation is a {{documentary}} by Jennifer Siebel Newsom, exploring and displaying {{the role that}} mainstream media plays in society today with regards to women and the under-representation of women in influential positions. Prominent women in today's society were featured in discussing how the media has impacted their life along with their views on how the media is impacting {{the lives of people}} from an early age. These media messages have a severe impact on how individuals carry themselves along with what aspects bog them down like insecurities with body image. This film encourages viewers to start to <b>see</b> <b>beyond</b> the message and not compare themselves to these picture perfect computer-generated images.|$|E
25|$|Goncharov's first novel, A Common Story, was {{published}} in Sovremennik in 1847. It dealt with {{the conflict between the}} excessive romanticism of a young Russian nobleman who has recently arrived in Saint Petersburg from the provinces, and the sober pragmatism of the emerging commercial class of the capital. A Common Story polarized critics and made its author famous. The novel was a direct response to Vissarion Belinsky's call for exposing a new type, that of the complacent romantic, common at the time; it was lavishly praised by the famous critic {{as one of the best}} Russian books of the year. The term aduyevschina (after the novel's protagonist Aduyev) became popular with reviewers who saw it as synonymous with vain romantic aspirations. Leo Tolstoy, who liked the novel, used the same word to describe social egotism and the inability of some people to <b>see</b> <b>beyond</b> their immediate interests.|$|E

On [...] "the most obvious level", Inglis adds, the song [...] "appears to be directed toward McCartney", as well as the divisions within the Beatles that reflect Apple's precarious position in 1969. In a January 2001 interview [...] with Guitar World magazine, Harrison remarked of this period: [...] "At that point in time, Paul couldn't <b>see</b> <b>beyond</b> himself. He was on a roll, but... in his mind, everything that was going on around him was just there to accompany him. He wasn't sensitive to stepping on other people's egos or feelings." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Gravett {{and fellow}} {{military}} enthusiast Trevor James Halsall, Somerset's decision {{to engage the}} Yorkist army on this plateau was sound. Defending the ground just before Towton would block any enemy advance towards the city of York, whether they moved along the LondonTowton road or an old Roman road to the west. The Lancastrians deployed {{on the north side}} of the dale, using the valley as a [...] "protective ditch"; the disadvantage of this position was that they could not <b>see</b> <b>beyond</b> the southern ridge of the dale. [...] The Lancastrian flanks were protected by marshes; their right was further secured by the steep banks of the Cock Beck. The width of their deployment area did not allow for a longer front line, depriving the Lancastrians of the opportunity to use their numerical superiority. [...] Waurin's account gave rise to the suggestion that Somerset ordered a force of mounted spearmen to conceal itself in Castle Hill Wood, ready to charge into the Yorkist left flank at an opportune time in battle.|$|E
500|$|According to Religion News Service writer Steve Rabey, [...] "Within You Without You" [...] "contrast Western individualism with Eastern monism". The lyrics convey basic {{tenets of}} Vedanta philosophy, {{particularly}} in Harrison's {{reference to the}} concept of maya (the illusory nature of existence), in the lines [...] "And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion / Never glimpse the truth". Author Joshua Greene paraphrases the song-wide message as: [...] "A wall of illusion separates us from each other … which only turns our love for one another cold. Peace will come when we learn to see past the illusion of differences and come to know that we are one …" [...] The solution espoused by Harrison is for individuals to <b>see</b> <b>beyond</b> the self and each seek change within, further to Vivekananda's contention in Raja Yoga that [...] "Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest that divinity …" [...] According to ethnomusicologist David Reck, aside from the reference to maya, the lyrics convey Indian philosophical concepts such as advait (the one essential reality), satya (perception of truth) and, in the line [...] "With our love we could save the world", universal love.|$|E
500|$|In {{describing}} {{the premise of}} the novel, Le Guin stated [...] "the hero of the book, the protagonist, he has a different gift, it isn’t magic at all, in fact, it’s another kind of talent. And his problem is to realize that he doesn’t have the kind he’s supposed to have, he has this other one. Which is a problem, actually, {{a lot of young people}} face: What is my gift?" [...] Reviewers have described Orrec's search for his own identity, in contrast to the identity that has been thrust upon him, as one of the major themes of the novel. This theme is related to the other major theme of the novel, that of power and responsibility. As he comes to terms with his identity, Orrec questions whether he is betraying his power by refusing to try to use it. Gry, too, is unwilling to use her gift to call animals to be hunted, and wonders whether [...] "all the gifts are backward.... They could have been healing, to begin with." [...] The novel ends with the two protagonists realizing that they are unwilling to remain in the cycle of violence and retribution in the Uplands, and leaving to keep their integrity; but they are also running toward a place where they can use their gifts as they please, rather than simply running away. A part of Orrec and Gry's process of growing up is to <b>see</b> <b>beyond</b> the binary choices they are presented with by society. Orrec is faced with a choice of whether to use his power, or to be blindfolded; Gry has to use her power to hunt, or not. Gry realizes that all of the upland powers can be used in two ways: for control and dominion, or for healing and nurturing. This recognition allows them to take a third choice, and leave. This wrestling with choice has been compared to the choices the characters are forced to make in Le Guin's novella The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas.|$|E

Thus we routinely observe objects that are receding faster than the speed of light and the Hubble sphere is not a horizon." ...|$|E
