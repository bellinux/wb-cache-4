40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{expected}} effects of the EEC Commission decision to open up EEC public procurement markets within the Single Market initiative. These effects are viewed {{on the behavior of}} European utilities and on the power equipment <b>supplying</b> <b>sector.</b> Both price and non-price effects are analyzed. The new market configuration should require a new kind of supplier, able to add the advantages of being "domestic" to the advantages of being part of a large, transnational group. Thus, such an institutional initiative can explain {{a large part of the}} general turmoil which hit the international power equipment industry in the late 1980 s. However, the increasing concentration of the supply sector-also stimulated in part by the success of gas turbine technology-reduces the expectation that EEC utilities will take advantage of the opening up of their procurement markets, at least in terms of lower equipment prices. ...|$|E

40|$|Sustainable development, {{after all}} these years development, has already been {{accepted}} as one of the themes of 21 st century, especially after the reveal of some serious environmental problems, such as global warming, resource exhaustion, etc. Construction industry, although being considered as one of the traditional industries of which the development speed is slowing down, is currently still playing {{an important role in the}} society and economy system. Meanwhile, it is also an industry that relies heavily on resources and energy consumption, especially the construction manufacturing industry. As a result, the pursuit of sustainability within the construction industry seems to be inevitable. In order to stimulate and push for the green transitioning in the construction industry in Europe, the European Commission issued the Green Public Procurement policy to motivate manufacturers of building products to develop green products and technologies. As a gesture of support, many member states quickly issued their own GPP policies which are more tailored for their specific situations. However, many challenges stand in the way toward fully implementation, and one of which is the shortage of qualified suppliers. Many existing literatures elaborate on the possibility of solving this challenge from the perspective of public authorities. This research, however, looks at this challenge from a different angle, the perspective of manufacturers of building products. This research studies into the flooring industry and intends to develop some suggestions for manufacturers who plan to develop green products based on the successful experiences of some frontrunners. To realize this objective, research questions are developed in this study: 1) What are the GPP requirements for flooring products in public construction projects and how are they evaluated? 2) What are the enablers and barriers during the development of green products? How do these factors get influenced by GPP policy? 3) Given the enablers and barriers, how can manufacturers of building products adjust their product development strategies to meet GPP criteria? What green attributes should be emphasized on during green product development? A literature review was conducted to find answers for the first research question. The EU GPP criteria are made for general terms of building products with no specification for each category. Two sets of criteria are contained in the EU GPP criteria, the core criteria and the comprehensive criteria which are built on the former. The main requirements of the core criteria are that products compete for public tenders should either be eco-labeled or provide detailed LCA reports to prove their environmental performance during life cycles, and if the products are wooden based, then the wooden materials are supposed to be responsibly sourced. The comprehensive criteria, based on the core criteria, add two more requirements regarding the recyclability of the products and the amount of recycled materials that should be contained in the products. In public tenders, the core criteria work as selection criteria for the qualification of suppliers, while the comprehensive criteria act as award criteria. Apart from the general EU GPP criteria, eco-label criteria can also be used as evaluation references. The eco-label criteria, comparing to the EU GPP criteria, are more detailed and specified. Three subgroups for the flooring products are made by the eco-label criteria, namely hard flooring, textile flooring, and wooden flooring. These criteria consider every stage and aspect in the life cycle of products, and only products fulfill all of them get to wear the labels. Case studies were conducted to research into question 2 and 3. Three frontrunner companies in the flooring industry who have successful experiences in marketing green products were interviewed, in order to identify the enabler and barriers of green product development process as well as some recognizable green product attributes. Main findings on enablers and barriers are listed Table A. As for the influence of the GPP policy, interviewees claimed it to be limited, mostly because they developed green products before or along with the development of the GPP policy. Enablers: 1) Motivations: concern for the sustainable development of the company; concern for the competitiveness of products; concern for the image of the company; market requirement. 2) Success factors: partnership; in-house knowledge base; government subsidies. Barriers: 1) worries about future uncertainty: high price perception of customers; low functional performance perception of customers; future uncertainty (policy change, market requirement change, etc.). 2) Practical difficulties: difficult to sell at competitive prices; development cost; need for extra knowledge and expertise; loss of government subsidies; stringent public scrutiny. Some of the most mentioned green product attributes by the interviewees are: - Toxin-free raw materials - Containment of recycled contents in products - Recyclability of products - Reduction of production wastes - Use of renewable energies - Closed-loop water recycling systems. Based on these findings, some recommendations are given for manufacturers of flooring products who plan to develop their own green products in the near future: For enablers: - Bring the plan of developing green products up to schedule to meet future market demand. - Build stable and cooperative relationships with main raw material suppliers and lead clients. - Start to cultivate in-house knowledge base for green product development. - Look out for government subsidy plans, and build project based on that. For barriers: - Consider long tern return on investment when setting prices for green products. - Try various ways to gather the initial investment, such as loan, partner investment, government subsidies, etc. - When choosing what green certificates to apply, consider the zone of influence of the certificates and the market area and <b>supplying</b> <b>sector</b> of the focal company. For green attributes: - Use toxin-free materials in the products. If greener alternative is not available yet, then keeping the toxic materials below safe limits is necessary. - Contain certain amount of recycled materials in the products. - The design of the products should enable recycling. - LCA assessment report shall be provided. - Use green packaging. - Use renewable energy in production. If not possible, then energy saving plans shall be applied. - Consider using water in closed loops. If not possible, then waste water should be processed before discharging to keep certain materials below required limits. - Consider reutilizing production wastes and by products.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Energy <b>supply</b> <b>sector</b> comprises all centrally and decentrally produced steam and electricity, and refineries. Within the EU, the energy <b>supply</b> <b>sector</b> is an important source of carbon dioxide, accounting for almost 40 % of total carbon dioxide emissions in 1990 and 31 % of total greenhouse gas emissions. Including all emissions of greenhouse gases from this sector, 32 % of the greenhouse gases are emitted by the energy <b>supply</b> <b>sector.</b> Description of the sector In 1995, in the EU 15 about 2300 TWh of electricity has been produced an...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{structural change}} in the power and heat producing <b>sector</b> (energy <b>supply)</b> {{and its implications for}} the economy. An integrated approach is used to describe the interactions between this sector {{and the rest of the}} economy. Thus, a very detailed model of the sector for Denmark has been linked to a macroeconometric model of the Danish economy. It is argued that analysing sectors that undergo radical changes, for example, the energy <b>supply</b> <b>sector</b> should be undertaken by using a model that describes the technological and organisational changes in production along with implications for the demand of the produced goods. Environmental priorities and targets for emission reductions are important for defining energy policy in Denmark. As the energy <b>supply</b> <b>sector</b> at present is a major contributor to emissions of CO 2 and SO 2, knowledge of this sector is vital for reducing these emissions. It is shown that quite substantial emission reductions are possible without encountering a substantial negative impact on the economy. The reduction potential through such economic incentives as fuel taxes is shown to be very sensitive to the technology used at present and in the future. This study also emphasises that the large reduction potential of emissions from the energy <b>supply</b> <b>sector</b> is a one-time gain. Fuel switching and increasing use of wind power cannot be repeated. Scenarios carried out with the combined model show that emission reduction in the energy <b>supply</b> <b>sector</b> will decrease the share of this sector in total emissions remarkably, and that the importance of the sector as a key element in any overall emission reduction strategy will decline. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: During {{the past}} decades in China, the {{traditional}} state monopoly has experienced difficulties {{in meeting the}} huge demand for new infrastructure and improvement in service levels, engendering the growth of different forms and degrees of private sector involvement. Since the 1990 s, China has started experimenting with the public-private partnership (PPP) delivery method in the water <b>supply</b> <b>sector.</b> However, many problems stemming from unsuccessful risk management have been encountered in PPP applications that have eventually led to project failure. This paper aims to identify and evaluate typical risks associated with PPP projects in the Chinese water <b>supply</b> <b>sector.</b> A literature review, a Delphi survey, and face-to-face interviews were used to achieve these objectives. Finally, a register of 16 critical risk factors (CRFs) of water PPP projects in China was established. The findings revealed that completion risk, inflation, and price change risk have a higher impact on Chinese water PPP projects, whereas government corruption, an imperfect law and supervision system, and a change in market demand have a lower impact on the water <b>supply</b> <b>sector.</b> The findings can help project stakeholders to improve the efficiency of privatization in public utility service and provide private investors with a better understanding while they participate in the enormous Chinese water marke...|$|R
40|$|Evidence from {{national}} surveys conducted in 1995, 2002 and 2006 shows that, despite {{a variety of}} specific Government training initiatives, the UK automotive <b>supply</b> <b>sector</b> lags behind international competition and suffers from severe skills shortages. Long term recovery from this position will require improvements in education, careers guidance, recruitment and work related training. The aim of this research has been to design a model of work related training for the sector to help ensure that the learning involved delivers sustained changes in behaviour and skills. A series of case studies have been reviewed to provide a context of work related training in the sector. Separate surveys were used ??? to benchmark training performance in a World Class manufacturer to understand realistic norms of training output, to sample the sustainability of learning amongst SMEs engaged on similar training programmes and to determine the range of training needs across the automotive <b>supply</b> <b>sector.</b> In total data was obtained from 833 individuals in 389 companies.
