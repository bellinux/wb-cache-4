50|$|<b>Searing</b> (or <b>pan</b> <b>searing)</b> is a {{technique}} used in grilling, baking, braising, roasting, sautéing, etc., in which {{the surface of the}} food (usually meat, poultry or fish) is cooked at high temperature until a caramelized crust forms. Similar techniques, browning and blackening, are typically used to sear all sides of a particular piece of meat, fish, poultry, etc. before finishing it in the oven. To obtain the desired brown or black crust, the meat surface must exceed 150 °C (300 °F), so searing requires the meat surface be free of water, which boils at around 100 °C (212 °F).|$|R
