40|$|We present {{ground-based}} mid-infrared {{observations of}} Class 0 protostars in LDN 1448. Of the five known protostars in this cloud, we detected two, L 1448 N:A and L 1448 C, at 12. 5, 17. 9, 20. 8, and 24. 5 µm, and a third, L 1448 IRS 2, at 24. 5 µm. We present high-resolution {{images of the}} detected sources, and photometry or upper limits for all five Class 0 sources in this cloud. With these data, {{we are able to}} augment existing spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for all five objects and place them on an evolutionary <b>status</b> <b>diagram.</b> Subject headings: ISM: individual(LDN 1448) –infrared: stars–methods: data analysis (mid-infrared imaging) –stars: formation 1 Visiting Astronomer at the Infrared Telescope Facility, which is operated by the University of Hawaii unde...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we report the {{development}} of a technique for modeling transient faults in redundant computer systems. Transient faults are characterized by their arrival rate and their duration. Fault detection, transient recovery, and the effect of permanent faults are included. A fault occurrence/recovery <b>status</b> state <b>diagram</b> is drawn to illustrate the operational status of the system while undergoing faults. The state diagram is used to formulate the equations for the mission failure probability. The techniques are then applied to a triple modular redundant computer system...|$|R

Highlights of the workshop, description of a new poster board design used in the poster sessions, lists of attendees and demonstrations, the program, and descriptions of the presentations are included...|$|R

Congenitally blind participants were poorer at identifying pictures haptically than adventitiously blind and blindfolded sighted people. Recognition of tactile pictures benefits by visual imagery, {{so they are}} not an intuitive method of informing people with no visual experience. Blind and blindfolded sighted participants explored 3 D objects using two fingers, with restricted cutaneous feedback. Whether meaningful information can be gleaned by touch alone is questionable and raises doubts for devices developed to enable blind people to explore objects in virtual environments...|$|R

In this paper the movement properties of middle- and old-aged adults are studied with series of single-file movement experiments under laboratory conditions. The fundamental diagrams for two different groups of pedestrians and time-space diagrams are compared. For the groups with different composition and <b>status,</b> the fundamental <b>diagrams</b> are totally different but maintain the same trend. Active crowd leads to inhomogeneous pedestrian flow but higher flow rate, while inactive pedestrians prefer {{to keep pace with}} others or keep larger personal space, which leads to more jams and stop-and-go waves. Density and inhomogeneous of speed do not always play main roles on the appearance of stop-and-go...|$|R
40|$|Cancer vesicae urinaria is {{the most}} common urologic cancer after cancer prostate. The {{incidence}} is increasing, and in 2001 1099 new cases were reported in Norway. Cigarette smoking is the largest known risk factor, and is responsible for 50 - 66 % of the cases. When working with this investigation, I read through 134 patient files. These patients have all been treated for cancer vesicae urinaria by the same urologist at Ringerike Hospital between 1994 and 2004. I collected data about the patients age, symptoms, cancer histology and WHO-grading and smoking <b>status</b> and made <b>diagrams</b> showing different connections. My results showed that 60 % of the men and 55 % of the women were over 70 years by the time of diagnosis. In 65 % of the cases the initial symptom was hematuri. All the patients had transitional cell carcinoma and 84 % of the patients had a superficial cancer type (Tis, Ta and T 1). 62 % of the patients were only treated with TUR-B and 16 % of the patients were also treated with BCG. 70 % of the male patients and 45 % of the female patients were smokers, and the distribution in histology and grading were the same as for the non-smokers. My results are based on only 134 patients, so it is difficult to draw conclusions. When that said, my results are in line with results from earlier studies on the subject, and therefore it could be possible to apply these diagrams on larger patient materials...|$|R
