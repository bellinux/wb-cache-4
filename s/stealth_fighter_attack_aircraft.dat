50|$|After World War II, {{the name}} {{strategic}} bomber came into use, for aircraft that could carry aircraft ordnances over long distances behind enemy lines. They were supplemented by smaller fighter-bombers with less range and lighter bomb load, for tactical strikes. Later these were called strike <b>fighters,</b> <b>attack</b> <b>aircraft</b> and multirole combat aircraft.|$|R
50|$|In 1991, the Air Force/Air Defense Forces had 8,000 {{personnel}} and 90 combat-capable aircraft, including 22 fighters, 59 <b>fighter</b> ground <b>attack</b> <b>aircraft</b> and 16 <b>attack</b> helicopters.|$|R
