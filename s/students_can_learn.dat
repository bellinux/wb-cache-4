2500|$|The Court {{then turned}} to {{consider}} whether the violation of freedom of religion could be upheld under section 1 of the Charter. [...] Following R. v. Oakes (1986), the Court asked {{whether there was a}} sufficient objective for the violation. [...] The main concern, as noted by the Quebec Court of Appeal, was school safety, which helps to maintain an atmosphere in which <b>students</b> <b>can</b> <b>learn.</b> [...] The Supreme Court agreed that would qualify as an important objective under section 1. [...] However, they then noted there were varying degrees of safety, with the highest degree of safety being excessive. [...] The Court contemplated the highest degree of safety would require the banning of scissors and other such objects. [...] Thus, safety in school is usually only supposed to be [...] "reasonable." [...] However, because the council wanted to rid the schools of weapons, the Court deemed the council's objective to be reasonable. [...] This raised the question as to whether the rights infringement was rational and proportionate to the objective. [...] The banning of the kirpan was considered rational because it was a weapon, and thus the banning fit the objective of ridding the school of weapons.|$|E

2500|$|Benjamin Bloom (1913–1999) {{spent over}} 50 {{years at the}} University of Chicago, where {{he worked in the}} {{department}} of education. He believed that all <b>students</b> <b>can</b> <b>learn.</b> He developed taxonomy of educational objectives. The objectives were divided into three domains: cognitive, affective, and psychomotor. The cognitive domain deals with how we think. It is divided into categories that are on a continuum from easiest to more complex. The categories are knowledge or recall, comprehension application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation. [...] The affective domain deals with emotions and has 5 categories. The categories are receiving phenomenon, responding to that phenomenon, valuing, organization, and internalizing values. The psychomotor domain deals with the development of motor skills, movement and coordination and has 7 categories, that also goes from simplest to complex. The 7 categories of the psychomotor domain are perception, set, guided response, mechanism, complex overt response, adaptation, and origination. The taxonomy provided broad educational objectives {{that could be used to}} help expand the curriculum to match the ideas in the taxonomy. [...] The taxonomy is considered to have a greater influence internationally than in the United States. Internationally, the taxonomy is used in every aspect of education from training of the teachers to the development of testing material. Bloom believed in communicating clear learning goals and promoting an active student. He thought that teachers should provide feedback to the students on their strengths and weaknesses. Bloom also did research on college students and their problem solving processes. He found that they differ in understanding the basis of the problem and the ideas in the problem. He also found that students differ in process of problem solving in their approach and attitude toward the problem.|$|E
