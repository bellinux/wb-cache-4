It traded its manufactured and agricultural goods to the coastal and interior peoples of Africa for salt, gold, timber, ivory, ebony, apes, peacocks, skins, and hides. Its merchants invented the practice of sale by auction {{and used it to}} trade with the African tribes. In other ports, they tried to establish permanent warehouses or sell their goods in open-air markets. They obtained amber from Scandinavia, and from the Celtiberians, Gauls, and Celts they got amber, tin, silver, and furs. Sardinia and Corsica produced gold and silver for Carthage, and Phoenician settlements on islands such as Malta and the Balearic Islands produced commodities that would be sent back to Carthage for large-scale distribution. The city supplied poorer civilizations with <b>simple</b> <b>products</b> such as pottery, metallic objects, and ornamentations, often displacing the local manufacturing, but brought its best works to wealthier ones such as the Greeks and Etruscans. Carthage traded in almost every commodity wanted by the ancient world, including spices from Arabia, Africa and India, and slaves (the empire of Carthage temporarily held a portion of Europe and sent conquered barbarian warriors into Northern African slavery).|$|E
2500|$|Rather {{than low}} wages, {{efficiency}} and scale, Birmingham's manufacturing growth was fuelled by a highly skilled workforce, specialisation, flexibility and, above all, innovation. The low {{barriers to entry}} to the Birmingham trades gave the town {{a high degree of}} social mobility and a distinctly entrepreneurial economy; the contemporary William Hutton described trades that [...] "spring up with the expedition of a blade of grass, and, like that, wither in the summer". In terms of manufacturing technology Birmingham was by far the most inventive town of the era: between 1760 and 1850 Birmingham residents registered over three times as many patents as those of any other town or city. Despite the landmark inventions of engineers such as James Watt, most of these developments are better characterised as part of a continuous flow of small-scale technological improvements. Matthew Boulton remarked in 1770 how [...] "by the many mechanical contrivances and extensive apparatus wh we are possess'd of, our men are enabled to do from twice to ten times the work that can be done without the help of such contrivances". Innovation also took place in production processes, particularly in the development of an extreme division of labour. Contemporary sources noted that in Birmingham even <b>simple</b> <b>products</b> such as buttons would pass through between fifty and seventy different processes, performed by a similar number of different workers. The resulting competitive advantage was noticed by Lunar Society member Richard Lovell Edgeworth when he visited Paris, observing that [...] "each artisan in Paris... must in his time 'play many parts', and among these many to which he is incompetent", concluding that [...] "even supposing French artisans to be of equal ability and industry with English competitors, they are left at least a century behind".|$|E

40|$|The {{topology}} of {{the causal}} boundary for standard static spacetimes [...] spacetimes time-invariantly conformal to a metric {{product of the}} Lorentz line and a Riemannian manifold [...] is studied in depth. As this is given {{in terms of a}} set of real-valued functions on the Riemannian factor, one could use a function-space topology, but physical reasons recommend a chronological topology instead. The function-space topology has a <b>simple</b> <b>product</b> structure, while the chronological topology might not. This paper examines when the chronological topology coincides with the function-space topology and when it has a <b>simple</b> <b>product</b> structure. A class of standard static spacetimes is examined, all of which yield a <b>simple</b> <b>product</b> structure for the causal boundary; the conformal class of these spacetimes includes classical spacetimes such as external Schwarzschild or Reissner-Nordstrom.

50|$|The first {{explanation}} of the attraction between noble gas atoms was given by Fritz London in 1930. He used a quantum-mechanical theory based on second-order perturbation theory. The perturbation {{is because of the}} Coulomb interaction between the electrons and nuclei of the two moieties (atoms or molecules). The second-order perturbation expression of the interaction energy contains a sum over states. The states appearing in this sum are <b>simple</b> <b>products</b> of the stimulated electronic states of the monomers. Thus, no intermolecular antisymmetrization of the electronic states is included and the Pauli exclusion principle is only partially satisfied.|$|E
