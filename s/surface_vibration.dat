40|$|High power {{machinery}} such as steam turbines, large {{pumps and}} motors often use journal bearings as rotor supports. This {{type of bearing}} is simple, low cost and with high load carrying capacity. However, abnormal operating conditions in the journal bearings will degrade machine performance, increase operating cost and may cause unexpected sudden failure which is dangerous in both engineering and safety terms. Bearing condition monitoring can detect faults {{at an early stage}} and prevent the occurrence of such failures which can be catastrophic. Monitoring techniques that have been used for monitoring of journal bearing are lubricant analysis, vibration analysis, noise and acoustic emission analysis. Lubricant analysis has been used effectively for condition monitoring for a long time but cannot be implemented in real time. Many researchers have studied the use of the vibration and sound signals and acoustic emissions generated by the hydrodynamic journal bearing for detecting and diagnosing faults. The studies give relatively little information regarding <b>surface</b> <b>vibration</b> and airborne sound characteristics for self-aligning spherical journal bearings, nor has comprehensive condition monitoring been implemented for a particular self-aligning spherical bearing journal. <b>Surface</b> <b>vibration,</b> airborne sound analysis and acoustic emission monitoring can be used simultaneously to detect any signal emitted from the bearing at very wide frequency range. Sound vibration occurs in solid structure, liquid and gases transmitted to air surrounding create airborne sound. This study has conducted a thorough review of theoretical and experimental studies. The research began with designing and building a test rig consisting of a drive system, radial loading system, torsion loading system, the bearing testing system itself and control, data acquisition and measurement instrumentation systems include encoder, pressure transducers, thermocouples, load cells, vibration transducer, acoustic and acoustic emission sensors. Preliminary experiments were conducted to ensure all equipment and instrumentation worked well and also to test measurement repeatability. Preliminary experiment results showed that all the equipment either driving, loading, data acquisition and measurement system works well. Experimental analysis of the <b>surface</b> <b>vibration,</b> airborne sound and acoustic emission analysis responses in time domain and frequency domain analysis include RMS value, Kurtosis and mean value showed good repeatability. The AE measurement response showed the best repeatability, followed by <b>surface</b> <b>vibration</b> and airborne response. Theoretical study shows that the self-aligning spherical journal bearing system under radial load generated <b>surface</b> <b>vibration,</b> airborne sound and acoustic emission responses that originated from external force excitation such as fluctuating loads due to system misalignment or unbalance and internal excitation such as asperity in boundary or mixed operation. These excitations generate structure-borne vibration and acoustic emission. The structure-borne vibration dynamic responses then radiated airborne sound. Airborne sound also originated from oil pressure fluctuation and flow turbulence. The <b>surface</b> <b>vibration</b> and airborne sound frequency responses occur at frequencies 100 kHz. The amplitude and frequency of <b>surface</b> <b>vibration,</b> airborne sound and acoustic emission is influence by radial load, shaft speed and surface quality of journal and bearing components themselves. The quality of asperity contact between journal and bearing may be due to manufacturing defect, lubricant and surface deterioration over time during operation. The experiments and analysis of the <b>surface</b> <b>vibration,</b> airborne sound and acoustic emission characteristics of the self-aligning spherical journal bearing indicate that there is a positive correlation between the spectrum mean value of <b>surface</b> <b>vibration,</b> airborne sound and acoustic emission with radial load and speed. Meanwhile, when use higher lubricant viscosity creates lower <b>surface</b> <b>vibration,</b> airborne sound and acoustic emission mean amplitude. Investigation of lubricant deterioration due to water contaminant indicated that when use higher concentration contaminant in the lubricant generates higher spectrum mean value of <b>surface</b> <b>vibration,</b> airborne sound and acoustic emission responses. The surface deterioration experiment showed that there is a clear significant different in the frequency domain of <b>surface</b> <b>vibration,</b> airborne sound and acoustic emission between a scratched surface and a normal surface journal bearing. The <b>surface</b> <b>vibration,</b> airborne sound and acoustic emission frequency characteristic for scratches and lubricant deterioration creates different peak amplitudes and different frequency. The larger the scratch generate the greater the amplitude and higher frequency. From of the three measurement systems used, acoustic emission is the most sensitive and a better detect of the bearing fault than followed by vibration and air-born sound measurement system. Therefore the acoustic emission measurement technique can be integrated with <b>surface</b> <b>vibration,</b> airborne sound for rotating machinery/engine condition monitoring. Using <b>surface</b> <b>vibration,</b> airborne sound and acoustic emission monitoring the symptoms of early damage at low, medium or high frequency can be detected and more severe and catastrophic failure can be prevented, and finally very high maintenance costs can be eliminated...|$|E

40|$|Machine {{noise is}} {{composed}} of air-borne noise, which is strictly of aerodynamic nature and which originates from openings like air-intake and exhaust, and of the noise emitted by the vibration of machine surface. The <b>surface</b> <b>vibration</b> noise caused by exciting forces depends on the transmitting or impeding characteristics of the machine structure and on the vibration characteristics of the external surface.

40|$|As the {{technologies}} of vehicles have improved, {{the need for}} reducing tire noise is becoming more important. So far, {{there have been several}} studies on this subject. In general, forces at the contact patch cause essentially structure-borne waves to propagate along the tire carcass and essentially airborne waves to propagate within the tire cavity. Since these wave types are coupled, the airborne interior waves contribute to tire <b>surface</b> <b>vibration</b> and then exterior sound radiation. However, the effect of the air cavity on external sound radiation has not been studied as extensively as the sound radiation from structure-borne vibrations. In fact, detecting a tire cavity mode under various conditions has recently become more important because {{it may be possible to}} detect hazardous substances such as explosives in the tire cavity by measuring acoustic radiation from the tire cavity. Here the effect of the interior acoustic mode on tire <b>surface</b> <b>vibration</b> (and hence, on sound radiation) has been studied. To this end, a fully-coupled finite element model of an inflated tire consisting of a treadband, sidewall and an acoustical cavity has been constructed. That model has been used to study the spatial character of the interior acoustic field and to distinguish between components associated with sub-sonic tire carcass vibration and the interior acoustical modes. The influence of the spatial distribution of the input force (i. e., point versus patch) on the relative strengths of the acoustic and structural modes has also been examined. The influence of the interior acoustic field on the tire <b>surface</b> <b>vibration</b> has been isolated by using wave number transform techniques to identify <b>surface</b> <b>vibration</b> components matching the interior mode in shape and phase speed. To investigate the effect of deflection in the contact patch area on carcass vibration and the interior acoustical modes, a deformed tire was simulated using a finite element model. It was confirmed that deflection in the contact patch area leads to separation of otherwise degenerate acoustical modes (i. e., the fore-aft mode and the vertical mode). Finally, wave-number filtering was applied to visualize the tire <b>surface</b> <b>vibration</b> related to the interior acoustical mode. A simple longitudinal quadrupole model for radiation from the fundamental cavity model for a tire on a reflecting surface was then proposed and was successfully compared with experimental results. ...|$|E

Although such an effect reduces the surface induced pairing correlations, as nucleons participating in Cooper pairs spend now part of their time in more complicated configurations, the resulting pairing gaps are still conspicuous.
