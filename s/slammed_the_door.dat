5|$|A book {{published}} in November 2011, Seal Target Geronimo, by Chuck Pfarrer, a former SEAL, contradicted the account {{as given by}} U.S. government sources. According to Pfarrer, neither helicopter crashed {{at the beginning of}} the raid. Instead, the SEALs jumped onto the roof from the hovering Razor 1 helicopter and entered a third-floor hallway from the roof terrace. Osama's third wife, Khairah, was in the hallway, headed towards the SEALs. She was blinded by a strobe light and pushed to the floor as the SEALs went past her. Osama bin Laden stuck his head out of a bedroom door, saw the SEALs, and <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> closed. At the same time, Osama's son Khalid bin Laden ran up the stairs to the third floor and was killed with two shots.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was between A.J. Styles and Abyss, {{in which the}} winner {{received}} an NWA World Heavyweight Championship match at Hard Justice. Its duration was 18 minutes even. The match began on the outside as Styles performed a front-flip onto Abyss, who {{was standing in the}} doorway of the cage. Later, as Styles was about to enter the cage, Abyss <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> twice into Styles, while the second door slam the second hit him in the face and caused him to crash to the floor and to bleed from the forehead. During the contest, Abyss used a steel chain as a weapon to help open up Styles' wound more. At one point, Abyss opened a bag and poured a large number of thumbtacks onto the mat, then proceeding to try to slam Styles into them. Styles countered and slammed Abyss face-first into the tacks instead with his signature maneuver, the Styles Clash. Near the end of the contest, Styles climbed the steel cage and stood on the top, but Abyss grabbed and threw the referee into the cage wall, causing Styles to fall and barely hang on. Abyss then followed by climbing the cage and by hanging Styles by the neck for a brief time with the steel chain. Then, Styles performed a sunset flip powerbomb and slammed Abyss into the tacks back-first. He followed by covering for the three count, winning of the encounter and earning his future title match.|$|E

25|$|The third {{match was}} between Crowbar and Terry Funk for the WCW Hardcore Championship. The match started when Funk ambushed Crowbar backstage. They fought inside a truck, and Funk sent Crowbar through {{a table with}} a hip toss. Crowbar {{attacked}} Funk with a car door, and slammed a door into Funk's head. Funk performed a low blow, and <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> into Crowbar's head repeatedly. Funk handcuffed Crowbar, and attacked him with the car door and a steel chair. Crowbar fought back with the chair, and performed a slingshot splash to Funk through a table. Funk fought back with chair shots, and pinned Crowbar after a piledriver on the car door to win the match and the title.|$|E
25|$|The {{house had}} a major roof leak that forced {{an end to the}} house tours in 1998. An {{architectural}} assessment was performed on the house and the cost to reconstruct the house was estimated between $116,020 and $126,220. Before the roof was repaired, there was a broken pipe in the dining room. The break happened in January 1999. It dumped 500,000 gallons of water through the first floor and into the basement. The rising basement waters extinguished the furnace, causing the water in the pipes and the radiators to freeze, then burst. City water meters knew there was a problem somewhere in the city, but no one could find the source of the leak. A volunteer at the house discovered the leak. The volunteer arranged for a heating repairman to stop the flooding. When the repairman left, he <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> closed. The door frame was so swollen that the volunteer was stuck inside. She had to go upstairs and call for help through a front window.|$|E
25|$|On March 17, 1997, Hart {{was given}} a shot to regain the title against Sid in a steel cage and thus change the main event at WrestleMania. If Hart won, his match with Austin at WrestleMania would become a title match while if Sid won, the {{regularly}} scheduled title match pitting him against the Undertaker would go on as planned. Since their respective matches would be affected, both Undertaker and Austin interfered in the match with Austin trying to help Hart so he could wrestle for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship and Undertaker trying to help Sid so he could keep his championship opportunity. Sid won the match by escaping the cage after Undertaker <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> in Hart's face as {{he was trying to}} exit. While the steel cage was being dismantled, Vince McMahon attempted to interview Hart, but a furious Hart grabbed the microphone and shoved McMahon down the mat before yelling expletives at him.|$|E

2500|$|Nevertheless, Verdi still {{refused to}} compose the music, taking the {{manuscript}} {{back to the}} impresario the next day. But Merelli would accept no refusal and he immediately stuffed the papers back into Verdi's pocket and [...] "not only threw me out of his office, but <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{in my face and}} locked himself in". Verdi claims that gradually he worked on the music: [...] "This verse today, tomorrow that, here a note, there a whole phrase, and little by little the opera was written" [...] so that by the autumn of 1841 it was complete. At the very least, both Verdi's and Lessona's versions end with a complete score.|$|E
2500|$|In Zukertort–Steinitz, London 1883, {{the future}} world champion, playing Black, had a difficult, {{possibly}} lost, game an [...] down, with his centralized king subject to attack by White's queen and two rooks. He played 27...Qd4+! (driving White's king to the corner) 28.Kh1 Rxf4! White cannot capture the rook {{because of the}} back-rank mate with Qd1. He could maintain a large advantage with 29.Rg1!, when 29...Qxb2 would be met by 30.Rh8 Nf6 31.Re1+ Ne4 (or 31...Re4 32.Re8!+ Nxe8 33.Rxe4+ and 34.Qxe8) 32.g3 Qc3 33.Rxe4+ Rxe4 34.Qe8+ Kf6 35.Qxe4 and wins. However, 28...Rf4 also seems to present White {{with an opportunity to}} win back a pawn or expose Black's king with 29.Re1+ and now (a) 29...Ne5 allows 30.Qxb7+; (b) 29...Re4 allows 30.Rxe4+ Qxe4 31.Qxa7 Qe1+ 32.Qg1; and (c) 29...Kf6? allows 30.Qh8+, forcing 30...Kf5 or 30...Kg5. Lured by this possibility, White played 29.Re1+? Re4 30.Rxe4+?? 30...Qxe4 31.Qxa7 (right-most diagram). However, Steinitz <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> shut with 31...b6! when the only way White could have stopped the back-rank mate was by giving up his rook (e.g. 32.Re3 Qxe3 33.h3), leaving him a knight down. Zukertort resigned.|$|E

2500|$|Joe Maxson, who {{had been}} hired to replace Lamphere in February 1908, awoke {{in the early hours}} of April 28, 1908, smelling smoke in his room, which was on the second floor of the Gunness house. He opened the hall door to a sheet of flames. Maxson screamed Gunness' name and those of her {{children}} but got no response. He <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and then, in his underwear, leapt from the second-story window of his room, barely surviving the fire that was closing in around him. He raced to town to get help, but by the time the old-fashioned hook-and-ladder arrived at the farm at early dawn, the farmhouse was a gutted heap of smoking ruins. Four bodies were found inside the house. [...] One of the bodies was that of a woman who could not immediately be identified as Gunness, since it had no head. The head was never found. The bodies of Gunness' children were found still in their beds. County Sheriff Smutzer had somehow heard about Lamphere’s alleged threats; he took one look at the carnage and quickly sought out the ex-handyman. Leliter came forward to recount his tale about Gunness' will and how she feared Lamphere would kill her and her family and burn her house down.|$|E
2500|$|Elizabeth Gaskell {{repeated}} Charlotte's {{words about}} Anne in The Life of Charlotte Brontë, {{claiming that the}} subject of The Tenant [...] "was painfully discordant to one who would fain have sheltered herself from all but peaceful and religious ideas". In his essay on Emily Brontë, Algernon Charles Swinburne briefly mentioned The Tenant {{in the context of}} Branwell's decline as a novel [...] "which deserves perhaps a little more notice and recognition than it has ever received" [...] and added that [...] "as a study of utterly flaccid and invertebrate immorality it bears signs of more faithful transcription from life than anything in Jane Eyre or Wuthering Heights". [...] Margaret Oliphant believed that Anne [...] "would have no right to be considered at all as a writer but for her association with [...] imperative spirits". Mary Ward, a novelist, who was widely known for her anti-feminist views, in her introduction to 1900 edition of The Tenant, accused Anne of [...] "the narrowness of view" [...] and absence of [...] "some subtle, innate correspondence between eye and brain, between brain and hand, [...] was present in Emily and Charlotte". She concluded that [...] "it is not as the writer of 'Wildfell Hall', but as the sister of Charlotte and Emily Brontë, that Anne Brontë escapes oblivion". May Sinclair, while famously saying that [...] "when [...] <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of Mrs. Huntingdon's bedroom she slammed it in the face of society and all existing moralities and conventions", considered that she [...] "had no genius". Sinclair wrote about The Tenant: [...] "There are scenes, there are situations, in Anne's amazing novel, which for sheer audacity stand alone in mid-Victorian literature, and which would hold their own in the literature of revolt that followed... Her diagnosis of certain states, her realization of certain motives, suggests Balzac rather than any of the Brontës". In her introduction to the 1914 edition of the novel Sinclair was also ambivalent about Anne and her novel — while acclaiming it as [...] "the first presentment of that Feminist novel", she stated that [...] "it bores to tears". Her opinion of Helen was also mixed: [...] "If Agnes Grey is a little prig, Helen Huntingdon is a prig enormous... She is Anne Bronte's idea of noble womanhood, the first of the modern, large-souled, intellectual heroines".|$|E
