60|$|At {{a little}} after eight her brother came down, {{and they had a}} sort of scrap breakfast in his study. The tea was made without the {{customary}} urn, and they dispensed with the usual rolls and toast. Eggs also were missing, for every egg in the parish had been whipped into custards, baked into pies, or boiled into lobster salad. The allowance of fresh butter was short, and Mr. Thorne was obliged to eat the <b>leg</b> <b>of</b> a <b>fowl</b> without having it devilled in the manner he loved.|$|R

60|$|Rawdon {{found some}} of the young fellows of the {{regiment}} seated in the mess-room at breakfast, and was induced without much difficulty to partake of that meal, and <b>of</b> the devilled <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> <b>fowls</b> and soda-water with which these young gentlemen fortified themselves. Then they had a conversation befitting the day and their time of life: about the next pigeon-match at Battersea, with relative bets upon Ross and Osbaldiston; about Mademoiselle Ariane of the French Opera, and who had left her, and how she was consoled by Panther Carr; and about the fight between the Butcher and the Pet, and the probabilities that it was a cross. Young Tandyman, a hero of seventeen, laboriously endeavouring to get up a pair of mustachios, had seen the fight, and spoke in the most scientific manner about the battle and the condition of the men. It was he who had driven the Butcher on to the ground in his drag and passed the whole of the previous night with him. Had there not been foul play he must have won it. All the old files of the Ring were in it; and Tandyman wouldn't pay; no, dammy, he wouldn't pay. It was but a year since the young Cornet, now so knowing a hand in Cribb's parlour, had a still lingering liking for toffy, and used to be birched at Eton.|$|R
60|$|Further {{conversation}} is prevented, for the time, by the necessity under which Mr. Bagnet finds himself of directing the whole {{force of his}} mind to the dinner, {{which is a little}} endangered by the dry humour <b>of</b> the <b>fowls</b> in not yielding any gravy, and also by the made gravy acquiring no flavour and turning out of a flaxen complexion. With a similar perverseness, the potatoes crumble off forks in the process of peeling, upheaving from their centres in every direction, as if they were subject to earthquakes. The <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fowls,</b> too, are longer than could be desired, and extremely scaly. Overcoming these disadvantages to the best of his ability, Mr. Bagnet at last dishes and they sit down at table, Mrs. Bagnet occupying the guest's place at his right hand.|$|R

60|$|It was, however, {{quickly and}} {{effectively}} done between them. Then the sister took the bird to {{a pot of}} water, which chanced to be boiling at the time, and put it therein, feathers and all. To civilised people this might have seemed rather a savage process, {{but it was not}} so. The object was merely to simplify the plucking. After scalding, the feathers came off with wonderful facility, and also stuck to the girl's wet hands with equally wonderful tenacity. Washing her hands, she next cut off the wings and <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fowl,</b> and then separated the breast from the back. These portions she put into a small pot with some suet and water, and threw the rest away.|$|R

The great Indian bustard was however a cryptic and wary bird making it a {{challenge}} for sportsmen, who had to stalk carefully (sometimes using covered bullock carts) to get within range.

60|$|Besides this African domestic, the seigneur of {{the village}} had another no less {{cherished}} and privileged attendant. This was a huge dog, of the mastiff breed, with a deep, hanging mouth, and a look of surly gravity. He walked about the cabin with {{the air of a}} dog perfectly at home, and who had paid for his passage. At dinner time he took his seat beside his master, giving him a glance now and then out of a corner of his eye, which bespoke perfect confidence {{that he would not be}} forgotten. Nor was he--every now and then a huge morsel would be thrown to him, peradventure the half-picked <b>leg</b> <b>of</b> a <b>fowl,</b> which he would receive with a snap like the springing of a steel-trap--one gulp, and all was down; and a glance of the eye told his master that he was ready for another consignment.|$|R

His sword and pistols, which had been placed at his side at the commencement of the evening, were carefully put by, and his pocket visited. Twenty guineas in gold, a large knife--used, probably, for the cutting of bread-and-cheese--some crumbs of those delicacies and a paper of tobacco found in the breeches-pockets, and in the bosom of the sky-blue coat, the <b>leg</b> <b>of</b> a cold <b>fowl</b> and half <b>of</b> a raw onion, constituted his whole property.|$|R

60|$|I do {{not know}} how physiologists look at such facts as the foregoing. According to the {{doctrine}} of pangenesis, the gemmules of the transposed organs become developed in the wrong place, from uniting with wrong cells or aggregates of cells during their nascent state; and this would follow from a slight modification in their elective affinities. Nor ought we to feel much surprise at the affinities of cells and gemmules varying, when we remember the many curious cases given in the seventeenth chapter, of plants which absolutely refuse to be fertilised by their own pollen, though abundantly fertile with that of any other individual of the same species, and in some cases only with that of a distinct species. It is manifest that the sexual elective affinities of such plants--to use the term employed by Gartner--have been modified. As the cells of adjoining or homologous parts will have nearly the same nature, they will be particularly liable to acquire by variation each other's elective affinities; and we can thus understand to a certain extent such cases as a crowd of horns on the heads of certain sheep, of several spurs on the <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> <b>fowls,</b> hackle-like feathers on the heads of the males <b>of</b> other <b>fowls,</b> and with the pigeon wing-like feathers on their legs and membrane between their toes, for the leg is the homologue of the wing. As all the organs of plants are homologous and spring from a common axis, it is natural that they should be eminently liable to transposition. It ought to be observed that when any compound part, such as an additional limb or an antenna, springs from a false position, it is only necessary that the few first gemmules should be wrongly attached; for these whilst developing would attract other gemmules in due succession, as in the regrowth of an amputated limb. When parts which are homologous and similar in structure, as the vertebrae of snakes or the stamens of polyandrous flowers, etc., are repeated many times in the same organism, closely allied gemmules must be extremely numerous, as well as the points to which they ought to become united; and, in accordance with the foregoing views, we can to a certain extent understand Isid. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire's law, that parts, which are already multiple, are extremely liable to vary in number.|$|R
50|$|<b>Scaly</b> <b>leg</b> is {{a disease}} of {{chickens}} and other birds. It {{is caused by a}} parasitic mite, Knemidocoptes mutans. The mite burrows under the scales in the bird's legs, but may also infest other areas, such as the comb or wattles of chickens. The mite spends its entire lifecycle on the birds and is usually spread by direct contact.|$|R

The figure crept along on its hands and knees, then it got up and staggered forward a few yards on its legs, only to fall and crawl again. Seeing that it must be somebody in distress, I sent one of my hunters to help him, and presently he arrived, and who do you suppose it turned out to be?" ...|$|R
