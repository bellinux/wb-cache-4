Leslie refers to Andy as [...] "a cute FDR", a reference to former President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Leslie <b>says</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> is as respected as charity worker Mother Teresa, as powerful as Soviet Union dictator Joseph Stalin and as beautiful as British politician Margaret Thatcher. A PDF copy of the town hall meeting flyer was posted on NBC's official Parks and Recreation website about Pawnee, Indiana; it included before-and-after pictures of the proposed park.|$|E
500|$|Eventually, Sue Anne visits Mac, {{their first}} {{encounter}} {{since she was}} a baby. Mac asks whether she got any of his letters, and she <b>says</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> kept them from her. Sue Anne also reports that Dixie tried to keep her from visiting Mac and that she plans to elope with her boyfriend despite her mother's objections. Mac admits he used to hit Dixie and that she divorced him after he tried to kill her in a drunken rage. Sue Anne asks whether Mac remembers a song about a dove he sang to her when she was a baby. He claims he does not, but after she leaves he sings to himself the hymn [...] "On the Wings of a Dove," [...] which references a dove from the Lord saving Noah and descending at Jesus' baptism.|$|E

"You are {{taller than}} I am, dearest," [...] <b>says</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> {{blushing}} over her whole sweet face--"and--and {{it is your}} hand, my dear, and not your foot {{he wants you to}} give him;" [...] and she said it with a hysteric laugh, that had more of tears than laughter in it; laying her head on her daughter's fair shoulder, and hiding it there. They made a very pretty picture together, and looked like a pair of sisters--the sweet simple matron seeming younger than her years, and her daughter, if not older, yet somehow, from a commanding manner and grace which she possessed above most women, her mother's superior and protectress.|$|E

6000|$|He found Mrs. Westley in {{a moment}} of disoccupation before he went, and used a friend's right to {{recognize}} the brilliancy of her Thursday. She refused all merit for it and asked him if he had ever seen any thing like the contrast of Charmian at the chocolate with Cornelia at the tea. [...] "Did you notice the gown Miss Saunders had on? It's one that her mother has just sent her from home. She <b>says</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> made it, and she came to ask me, the other day, if it would do to pour tea in. Wasn't it delightful? I'm going to have her spend a week with me in Lent. The general has taken a great fancy to her. I think I begin to appreciate her fascination; it's her courage and her candor together. Most girls are so uncertain and capricious. It's delightful to meet such a straightforward and downright creature." ...|$|E
6000|$|I remember, {{and while}} I am writing this story I think I hear the very sound of it: a certain lady had an only daughter, a young maiden about {{nineteen}} years old, {{and who was}} possessed of a very considerable fortune. They were only lodgers {{in the house where}} they were. The young woman, her mother, and the maid had been abroad on some occasion, I do not remember what, for the house was not shut up; but about two hours after they came home, the young lady complained she was not well; in {{a quarter of an hour}} more she vomited, and had a violent pain in her head. [...] "Pray God," [...] <b>says</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> in a terrible fright, [...] "my child has not the distemper!" [...] The pain in her head increasing, her mother ordered the bed to be warmed, and resolved to put her to bed, and prepared to give her things to sweat, which was the ordinary remedy to be taken when the first apprehensions of the distemper began.|$|E
6000|$|Pollnitz himself adds two circumstances, {{in regard}} to it, which are pretty impossible: as, first, that Friedrich Wilhelm had joyfully consented to this clandestine marriage, and was eagerly waiting for it; second, that George II. too had privately favored or even instigated the adventure, being at heart willing to escape the trouble of Messages to Parliament, to put his Son in the wrong, and I know not what. [Pollnitz, ii. 272-274.] The {{particles}} of fact in the affair are likewise two: First, that Queen Sophie, and from her the Courtier Public generally, expected the Hanover Royal Highness, who probably had real thoughts of seeing Berlin and his Intended, on this occasion; Dubourgay reports daily rumors of the Royal Highness being actually [...] "seen" [...] there in an evanescent manner; and Wilhelmina <b>says,</b> <b>her</b> <b>Mother</b> was so certain of him, [...] "she took every ass or mule for the Royal Highness,"--heartily indifferent to Wilhelmina. This is the first particle of fact. The Second is, that a subaltern Official about the Royal Highness, one Lamothe of Hanover, who had appeared in Berlin about that time, was thrown into prison not long after, for what misbehavior none knew,--for encouraging dissolute Royal Highness in wild schemes, it was guessed. And so the Myth grew, and was found ready for Pollnitz and his followers. Royal Highness did come over to England; not then as the Myth bears, but nine months afterwards in December next; and found other means of irritating his imperative, flighty, irascible and rather foolish little Father, in an ever-increasing degree. [...] "Very coldly received at Court," [...] it is said: ill seen by Walpole and the Powers; being too likely to become a focus of Opposition there.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think--I do not think--she would <b>say</b> no. <b>Her</b> <b>mother,</b> I {{have reason}} to believe--Let me sound them--discreetly." [...] The old pastor's red face glowed redder, yet with pleasurable anticipation; he was a born matchmaker.|$|R
60|$|In the drawing-room, Lady Conway spoke so graciously, that Clara, {{was quite}} distressed at {{looking over her}} head. Mary looked {{somewhat}} oppressed, <b>saying</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> {{had not been so}} well that day; and she was disposed to keep in the background, and occupy herself with Clara; but it was quite contrary to the Giraffe's notions to be engrossed by any one when Louis was coming. As if she had divined Mary's intentions of keeping her from importuning him, she was continually gazing at the door, ready at once to claim his attention.|$|R
5000|$|Her Mémoires de Madame Roland (1795) {{were written}} from prison {{where she was}} held as a Girondin sympathizer. It covers her work for the Girondins while her husband Jean-Marie Roland was Interior Minister. The book echoes such popular novels as Rousseaus Julie, or the New Heloise by linking her {{feminine}} virtue and motherhood to her sacrifice in a cycle of suffering and consolation. Roland <b>says</b> <b>her</b> <b>mothers</b> death was the impetus for her [...] "odyssey from virtuous daughter to revolutionary heroine" [...] as it introduced her to death and sacrifice - with the ultimate sacrifice of her own life for her political beliefs.|$|R

6000|$|The young man's {{face was}} very red; he was forgetting {{to hide it}} now. Then it went white, and he said through clenched teeth: [...] "She sends me mad! I don't know how not to--If I don't get her, I shall shoot myself. I shall, you know--I'm that sort. It's her eyes. They draw you right out of yourself--and leave you--" [...] And from his gloved hand the smoked-out cigarette-end fell to the floor. [...] "They <b>say</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> was like that.

5000|$|The theme song, [...] "Pleasant Nightmare", {{was written}} by Jared Faber and Emily Kapnek and is sung by Alih Jey. The theme song is {{slightly}} different in episode 22 (the last episode of season 1).

His sister, Salome I, was chief witness against <b>her.</b> Mariamne I's <b>mother</b> Alexandra made an appearance and incriminated her own daughter. Historians <b>say</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> was next on Herod's list to be executed and did this only to save her own life. Mariamne was executed, and Alexandra declared herself Queen, stating that Herod was mentally unfit to serve. Josephus wrote that this was Alexandra's strategic mistake; Herod executed her without trial.|$|R
