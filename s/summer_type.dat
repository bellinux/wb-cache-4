The amount of winter precipitation of those two biomes is much higher than that of the other tree biomes. This higher amount of winter precipitation encourages the dominance of evergreen woods and succulents in those two biomes. Especially the succulents efficiently utilize the winter precipitation. This leads to the dominance of the succulents on those two biomes...|$|R

The structure of the current pattern appeared strongly dependent on the stratification conditions. The flow was quasi-barotropic during the periods of weak inverse thermal stratification {{at the end of}} winter season and at transition from the inverse thermal stratification to <b>summer</b> <b>type</b> stratification when the sea was thermally unstratified, but mostly two-layered (baroclinic) when the <b>summer</b> <b>type</b> thermal stratification had developed. The alternation of strong westward (eastward) currents (up to 30  cm s− 1) in the upper layer is explained in terms of coastal upwelling (downwelling) due to favourable background winds. The measured and the modelled upper layers along isobath currents showed a noticeable correlation with the correlation coefficient of 0. 52 and 0. 82 during the periods of winter type and <b>summer</b> <b>type</b> stratifications, respectively, and the absence of a significant correlation during the transition period. The eastward (upwind) current episodes with speeds reaching 18  cm s− 1 below the seasonal thermocline are likely to reflect the specific circulation response in the elongated basin caused by the easterly wind. The long-term mean (over 3. 5 months) current vector (− 2. 0  cm s− 1, − 2. 9  cm s− 1) was westward in the upper sea and eastward, nearly along isobaths (1. 1  cm s− 1, − 0. 3  cm s− 1) in the deeper layers...|$|E

During the summers of 1988 and 1989 samples of schoolchildren were followed during several months {{with respect to their}} pulmonary function in relation to ambient air pollution. As an indicator for the mixture of <b>summer</b> <b>type</b> air pollution ozone was used. During the summer of 1988 no elevated ozone levels occurred, however during the summer of 1989 relatively high ozone levels up to 230 mug/m 3 were measured. No associations between pulmonary function and ozone concentrations were seen in the 1988 sample; in the 1989 sample statistically significant negative associations between several pulmonary function parameters and outdoor ozone concentration were found. The strongest association was found between Peak Expiratory Flow and ozone (approximately 8 % decrease at a 200 mug/m 3 increase in the ozone concentration). The decrements were slightly lower when the association was adjusted for outdoor temperature. No relationships between presence or absence of chronic respiratory symptoms and the magnitude of the ozone response were found. No relationship between acute respiratory symptoms and ozone concentrations were found. From the results it is concluded that acute respiratory effects of ozone were found below the current 1 hour standard of 240 mug/m 3. ...|$|E

In winter, Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) exhibit several alterations in physiology and behaviour, including inhibition of the reproductive axis, alterations of immune function, reduction in body mass, pelage molt, and thermoregulato-ry adjustments (1). All of these adjustments presumably help indi-viduals restrict reproduction {{to the spring}} and summer when conditions are more conducive to offspring survival. Siberian ham-sters and many other species monitor changes in day length and thereby drive seasonal rhythms of physiology and behaviour (2).

40|$|Abstract Background Before 1986, scrub typhus {{was only}} found endemic in {{southern}} China. Because human infections typically {{occur in the}} summer, it is called "summer type". During the autumn-winter period of 1986, {{a new type of}} scrub typhus was identified in Shandong and northern Jiangsu province of northern China. This newly recognized scrub typhus was subsequently reported in many areas of northern China and was then called "autumn-winter type". However, clinical characteristics of associated cases have not been reported. Methods From 1995 to 2006, all suspected scrub typhus cases in five township hospitals of Feixian county, Shandong province were enrolled. Indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA) was used as confirmatory serodiagnosis test. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) connected with restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and sequence analyses were used for genotyping of O. tsutsugamushi DNAs. Clinical symptoms and demography of confirmed cases were analyzed. Results A total of 480 scrub typhus cases were confirmed. The cases occurred every year exclusively between September and December with a peak occurrence in October. The case numbers were relatively higher in 1995, 1996, 1997, and 2000 than in other years. 57. 9 % of cases were in the group aged 21 – 50. More cases occurred in male (56 %) than in female (44 %). The predominant occupational group of the cases was farmers (85. 0 %). Farm work was reported the primary exposure to infection in 67. 7 % of cases. Fever, rash, and eschar were observed in 100. 0 %, 90. 4 %, and 88. 5 % of cases, respectively. Eschars formed frequently on or around umbilicus, abdomen areas, and front and back of waist (34. 1 %) in both genders. Normal results were observed in 88. 7 % (WBC counts), 84. 5 % (PLT counts), and 89. 7 % (RBC counts) of cases, respectively. Observations from the five hospitals were compared and no significant differences were found. Conclusion The autumn-winter type scrub typhus in northern China occurred exclusively from September to December with a peak occurrence in October, which was different from the <b>summer</b> <b>type</b> in southern China. In comparison with the <b>summer</b> <b>type,</b> complications associated with autumn-winter type scrub typhus were less severe, and abnormalities of routine hematological parameters were less obvious. </p...|$|E
40|$|The Mediterranean {{climate is}} {{generally}} found between latitudes of 30 and 40 degrees {{on the western}} coasts of continents. It {{is characterized by a}} dry, hot summer alternating with a humid and temperate winter. The dry season may span from one to eight months and it occurs during the summer (the long-day season). It rains in winter with typical mean rainfall values of 500 mm. The vapor pressure deficit (vpd) decreases from midautumn to winter, reaching the lowest values during winter. It increases later toward the summer (Strahler, 1986). Globally, the Mediterranean climate is found in five regions (see Figure 14. 1) : the coasts of the Mediterranean Sea, the center and southern coasts of California and northern coast of Mexico, central Chile, the southern tip of Southern Africa, and southwest Australia. Two major variants of the Mediterranean climate can be distinguished according to mean summer temperature: dry, hot summer (mean temperature of the hottest month as high as 22 to 28 °C); and marine regions of temperate, humid zones (mean temperature of the hottest month from 14 to 22 °C).

40|$|Physiological {{characteristics}} of luminous bacteria {{isolated from the}} Mediterranean and Gulf of Elat were compared to determine {{their relationship to the}} specific seasonal and geographic distribution patterns of these bacteria. The effects of temperature on growth rate and yield, relative sensitivity to photooxidation, resistance to high salt concentration (8 %), and ability to grow in nutrient-poor conditions appear to control these patterns. The winter appearance of Photobacterium fischeri and the succession of winter and <b>summer</b> <b>types</b> of Beneckea harveyi in the eastern Mediterranean are explained by different temperature requirements for growth. Sensitivity to photooxidation explains the disappearance of P. leiognathi, present in {{the main body of the}} Gulf of Elat throughout the year, from the shallow coastal strip. B. harveyi is present in this coastal strip which is higher in nutrients and in productivity than the open waters. Competition experiments between B. harveyi and P. leiognathi in batch and continuous culture indicate that the oligotrophic P. leiognathi is outcompeted by B. harveyi in rich and even in relatively poor media.

40|$|An {{observational}} {{study has been}} conducted into the seasonal characteristics of the cold-air pool formation in a hollow in the subalpine area of the Yatsugatake Range during the warm seasons from 1995 through to 1997. The uniqueness {{of the present study}} is a detection of seasonal differences in the formation processes based on a 3 -year observation. The maximum inversion (maximum difference of nighttime air temperature between the bottom and summit of the hollow) is used to determine the cold-air pool formation, which frequently occurred on {{more than half of the}} observational days, and to examine its seasonal variation and intensity. The classification of the type of pressure pattern under which the cold-air pool is formed reveals that the North Pacific anticyclone (Type 5) and migratory anticyclone (Type 3) are closely associated with remarkable cold-air pool formation. The cold-air pool exhibits a seasonal variability and can be categorized into two types: the summer and the autumn types. As for the <b>summer</b> <b>type,</b> cold-air pools are formed gradually, from sunset to midnight, and the intensity of the inversion is relatively weak. This weak inversion may be due to increased downward long-wave radiation, which is inferred from the increased cloud amounts and water vapour content. The high content of water vapour, associated with cloud formation, is advected by the thermally induced winds. On the other hand, the autumn type is characterized by conditions favourable for cold-air pool formation, with fine weather and dry air conditions throughout the day. In brief, cold-air pool formation is governed by both the effects of local humidity and synoptic weather conditions in central Japan. Copyright © 2000 Royal Meteorological Society.

Meteorological elements measured with the sonde attached to 600 gr Latex balloon were : Temperature with bead-type thermistor (0. 5 - 1. 0 mm in diameter, 1. 0 - 1. 5 mm long), humidity with carbon-type hygrometer (thickness 1 mm, size 16 × 60 mm), and pressure with bellow-type barometer (60 mm in diameter). Signals were received by a D 55 B Automatic Direction Finder with parametric amplifier, and were printed automatically. Monthly average values of temperature, height, and humidity were computed. Increase in humidity was observed in late summer and the decrease was noticed in late spring, which indicated the change of air mass over Syowa Station. Analysis of mean monthly temperatures at 500 mb-level showed that there were pronounced year-to-year variations in all seasons except winter. Mean monthly temperatures at 50 mb-level indicated large year-to-year variations in September, October, and November. In the troposphere and the stratosphere, the southerly wind component prevailed in April-May (autumn) and September-October (spring), and the easterly wind component which was predominant in summer disappeared in the stratosphere during winter.

40|$|I {{have made}} {{researches}} on the kernel of an eruptive febrile disease {{which is usually}} seen, exceptionally in summer, at Aioi-mura, Okawa-gun, {{the eastern part of}} Kagawaken. The nature of this disease was unknown but I have succeeded in the isolation of Rickettsia from a patient, and made it clear that bacteriological natures and the Rickettsia isolated are identical with Rickettsia tsutsugamushi (orientalis). A similar disease in Tsuda-cho, Okawa-gun has been proved also to be Tsutsugamushi disease. while it can be seen in winter. This proves that there is a serious kind of Tsutsugamushi disease that develops in summer and a comparatively mild kind that develops in winter. The following shows the research I have made through clinical findings on each of the different types of tsutsugamushi disease. 1. Both Aioi-mura and Tsuda-cho are topographically located near the sea. It is usually the case that the patients houses are situated in lower land districts. 2. It develops only in summer in Aioi-mura with the duration of months from June to September. 3. It develops irrespective of age. In the block of Umayado (Aza Umayado) and Sakamoto (Aza Sakamoto) of Aioi-mura, I have found all the people, regardless of their ages, exposed in their home to the attack of the disease. 4. People of the contaminated areas are engaged in farming with fishing as their side job. Almost none of them raise pigs. This shows that pigs are not the cause of it. It is not as yet clear whether it is from the migratory birds. 5. No relation of cause and effect can be found between the occupation of the villagers snd the outbreak of the disease of the patients. 6. Clinical findings of the patients Mr. Mitani who had the disease in summer in Aioimura, and Mr. Tanizawa, in winter in Tsuda-cho are both found to be the same with those of Tsutsugamushi disease, and antibiotics especially the Terramycin is effective for it. Serums of the patients agglutinated the OXK remarkably, and assurance of the rising of the agglutination titers shows that it does not differ from the Tsutsugamushi disease. 7. The antibiotics especially the Chloromycetin and Terramycin are very effective. With these antibiotics the fever goes down. After the fever drops, it is difficult to isolate the Rickettsia from the blood. In brief, I have analyzed the clinical findings of de-velopment of "Umayado Disease", a local eruptive febrile disease, and at the same time, classified the peculiar local type of Tsutsugamushi disease according to the clinical findings into the <b>summer</b> <b>type</b> and the winter one. This leads to the fact that in a single prefecture and moreover at the places quite close to each other there can be seen a serious and a mild type of Tsutsugamushi disease in summer and winter respectively, which I think is sure to contribute to the study on the distribution and epidemic researches of Tsutsugamushi disease...|$|E
