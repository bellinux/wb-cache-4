In this paper, the <b>sensitivity</b> <b>coefficient</b> for each device parameter was separated into two factors: one due to an intrinsic mechanism [one-dimensional (1 D) factor] and another due to short-channel effects [two-dimensional (2 D) factor]. Using this concept, the variations in the threshold voltage and the sensitivity coefficients in doped fin field effect transistors (FinFETs), undoped FinFETs and planar metal-oxide-semiconductor FETs (MOSFETs), whose structures are based on the ITRS, were evaluated for the fluctuations in the principal device parameters.
