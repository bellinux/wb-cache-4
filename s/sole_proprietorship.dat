At its height from the mid-1980s and onwards it {{operated}} scheduled flights to Stavanger, Bergen, Trondheim and Copenhagen, and for shorter periods also other Norwegian and international destinations. The airline had 156 employees and 150,000 annual passengers in 1989. The company was {{established as a}} <b>sole</b> <b>proprietorship</b> by Øyvind Skaunfelt as Vestfoldfly in 1961, after purchasing Thor Solberg's aviation school at Tønsberg Airport, Jarlsberg. In addition to an aviation college, the company operated various charter services using mostly Cessna aircraft. The company split into a flying school and an airline in 1972, with the latter taking the name Norsk Flytjeneste. Three 50-passenger Douglas DC-6 were subsequently bought and were among other places flown with aid charters to Bangladesh. Both the DC-6 and later charter flights with business jets proved unprofitable and were quickly terminated.|$|E

40|$|Survey of Business Owners {{data was}} used to compare the husband or wife as the primary {{operator}} of jointly owned employer and nonemployer copreneur firms. The analysis found 1. 7 million firms, which account for ten percent of all firms, or fourteen percent of <b>sole</b> <b>proprietorships.</b> Nearly three-fourths of copreneur businesses are operated by men. The majority (88. 9 percent) of copreneur firms do not have employees.

An important finding was that differences that might be attributed to gender are more likely due {{to whether or not the}} firm has employees. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This paper deepens our understanding of copreneurs by using the large Survey of Business Owners (SBO) database to analyze the business outcomes when the husband and wife are compared as the primary operator of jointly owned employer and nonemployer <b>sole</b> <b>proprietorships.</b> Based on 72. 6 percent of the 23 million nonfarm firms that responded to the survey, two questions unambiguously identify copreneurs. The federal economic census overcomes the research limitations of small sample size and/or non-representative samples. The study found 1. 7 million jointly owned <b>sole</b> <b>proprietorships,</b> which account for 10. 1 percent of all firms (corporations, partnerships and <b>sole</b> <b>proprietorships)</b> or 14. 1 percent of respondent <b>sole</b> <b>proprietorships.</b> Nearly three-fourths (72. 7 percent) of copreneurships are operated by men.

25|$|Post-financial {{crisis and}} several {{spectacular}} fund governance failures, {{there has been}} much debate among fund directors worldwide about whether the proprietorship or professional firm approach is best for a professional fund. The matter has also been studied extensively by leading independent academic researchers at the Stanford Law Review, University of Kentucky and University of Cambridge among many others. Collectively these independent studies shattered many of the myths about professional fund governance and consistently supported the professional firm model over the proprietor model. Currently there is no independent research that supports the proprietorship model. In the Stanford Law Review, the authors argue “we know of no other service provided for corporations that is obligated by law to be performed by a <b>sole</b> <b>proprietorship,</b> and for good reason. Lawyers, consultants, accountants, doctors, and so on, all associate with each other to form corporate entities to provide their services for a host of well understood reasons".|$|E

[...] In Canada (as in some other jurisdictions) conversion of a <b>sole</b> <b>proprietorship</b> family farm to a family corporation can have tax planning benefits, and in some cases, the difference in combined provincial and federal taxation rates is substantial. [...] Also, for farm families with significant off-farm income, incorporating the farm can provide some shelter from high personal income tax rates. [...] Another important consideration can be some protection of the corporate shareholders from liability.

[...] As far as Joseph P. Hale, he too had traveled a similar path, but focused on production efficiency and assembly-line work methods. [...] His bold new ideas made him rich, made the piano more affordable for the middle class, and made him strongly disliked by his competitors.

40|$|This paper {{asks how}} the {{performance}} of self-employed unincorporated businesses affects {{the size of the}} gap in labour productivity between Canada and the United States. To do so, the business sector in each country is divided into unincorporated and corporate businesses, and estimates of labour productivity are generated for each sector. The productivity performance of the unincorporated sector relative to the corporate sector is much lower in Canada than in the United States. As a result, when the unincorporated sector is removed from the estimates for the business sector in each country and only the corporate sectors for the two countries are compared, the gap in the level of productivity between Canada and the United States is reduced. The unincorporated sector consists of both <b>sole</b> <b>proprietorships</b> and partnerships. This paper also investigates the impact of just <b>sole</b> <b>proprietorships</b> on the Canada-United States productivity gap. <b>Sole</b> <b>proprietorships</b> in the two countries more closely resemble one another than do partnerships, as U. S. partnerships are much larger than their Canadian counterparts. When <b>sole</b> <b>proprietorships</b> are removed from the business-sector estimates of each country (allowing a comparison of <b>sole</b> <b>proprietorships</b> {{to the rest of the}} business sector, which consists of partnerships and the corporate sector), the gap in labour productivity between Canada and the United States also declines but by only about half as much as when both <b>sole</b> <b>proprietorships</b> and partnerships are removed. The lower productivity of the unincorporated sector (both <b>sole</b> <b>proprietorships</b> and partnerships) accounted for almost the entire productivity gap between Canada and the United States in 1998. Since then, the productivity of the corporate sector in Canada has fallen relative to that of the corporate sector in the United States and the unincorporated sector no longer accounts for the entire gap.

At Lugo on 7 March 1122, {{in the presence of}} the royal court, Suero and Enderquina donated Cornellana to the Abbey of Cluny. Along with Cornellana itself they donated a block of properties [...] "acquired by inheritance or by [...] own efforts" [...] (de parentibus nostris vel de nostris ganantiis, [...] "from our parents and from our purchases"). All the lands Cluny received amounted to [...] "fifty-six different properties scattered across a vast area, as well as four monasteria , six churches and a castle (castellum)." [...] Suero had received one church (ecclesiam) and three or four monasteries (monasteria) from Queen Urraca [...] "by charter" [...] (per incartationes), another three and a half churches plus a portion (portionem) in another he had inherited (called hereditates) or purchased (called gananciales). These were all proprietary churches he owned, but the difference between ecclesiae and monasteria is not clear. Cluny also received estates (villas) and male and female slaves (servos et ancillas). The donation was confirmed by Urraca, Alfonso VII, the queen's daughter Sancha Raimúdez, Diego Gelmírez, Pelayo of Oviedo, Diego of León, Peter III of Lugo, the prior of the monastery of San Zoilo de Carrión, and a [...] "curious mixture of [...] Galicians and Asturians".

6000|$|Rousseau had no {{taste for}} martyrdom, nor any {{intention}} of courting it in even its slightest forms. Holland was now the great printing press of France, and when we are counting up the contributions of Protestantism to the enfranchisement of Europe, it is just to remember the indispensable services rendered by {{the freedom of the}} press in Holland to the dissemination of French thought in the eighteenth century, as well as the shelter that it gave to the French thinkers in the seventeenth, including Descartes, the greatest of them all. The monstrous tediousness of printing a book at Amsterdam or the Hague, the delay, loss, and confusion in receiving and transmitting the proofs, and the subterranean character of the entire process, including the circulation of the book after it was once fairly printed, were as grievous to Rousseau as to authors of more impetuous temper. He agreed with Rey, for instance, the Amsterdam printer, to sell him the Social Contract for 1000 francs. The manuscript had then to be cunningly conveyed to Amsterdam. Rousseau wrote it out in very small characters, sealed it carefully up, and entrusted it to the care of the chaplain of the Dutch embassy, who happened to be a native of Vaud. In passing the barrier, the packet fell {{into the hands of the}} officials. They tore it open and examined it, happily unconscious that they were handling the most explosive kind of gunpowder that they had ever meddled with. It was not until the chaplain claimed it in the name of ambassadorial privilege, that the manuscript was allowed to go on its way to the press.[79] Rousseau repeats a hundred times, not only in the Confessions, but also in letters to his friends, how resolutely and carefully he avoided any evasion of the laws of the country in which he lived. The French government was anxious enough on all grounds to secure for France the production of the books of which France was the great consumer, but the severity of its censorship prevented this.[80] The introduction of the books, when printed, was tolerated or connived at, because the country would hardly have endured to be deprived of the enjoyment of its own literature. By a greater inconsistency the reprinting of a book which had once found admission into the country, was also connived at. Thus M. de Malesherbes, out of friendship for Rousseau, wished to have an edition of the New Heloïsa printed in France, and sold for the benefit of the author. That he should have done so is a curious illustration of the low morality engendered by a repressive system imperfectly carried out. For Rousseau had sold the book to Rey. Rey had treated with a French bookseller in the usual way, that is, had sent him half the edition printed, the bookseller paying either in cash or other books for all the copies he received. Therefore to print an independent edition in Paris was to injure, not Rey the foreigner, but the French bookseller who stood practically in Rey's place. It was setting two French booksellers to ruin one another. Rousseau emphatically declined to receive any profit from such a transaction. But, said Malesherbes, you sold to Rey a right which you had not got, the right of <b>sole</b> <b>proprietorship,</b> excluding the competition of a pirated reprint. Then, answered Rousseau, if the right which I sold happens to prove less than I thought, it is clear that far from taking advantage of my mistake, I owe to Rey compensation for any loss that he may suffer.[81] ...|$|E
