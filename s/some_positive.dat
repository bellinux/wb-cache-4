5|$|Due to {{the tree}} of heaven's weedy habit, landowners and other organisations often resort to various methods of control {{in order to keep}} its populations in check. For example, the city of Basel in Switzerland has an {{eradication}} program for the tree. It can be very difficult to eradicate, however. Means of eradication can be physical, thermal, managerial, biological or chemical. A combination of several of these can be most effective, though they must of course be compatible. All have <b>some</b> <b>positive</b> and negative aspects, but the most effective regimen is generally a mixture of chemical and physical control. It involves the application of foliar or basal herbicides in order to kill existing trees, while either hand pulling or mowing seedlings in order to prevent new growth.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the {{negative}} reception, the Wii version has had <b>some</b> <b>positive</b> reception. While Official Nintendo Magazine UK editor Tom East similarly bemoaned the motion controls, {{he felt that the}} multiplayer still held up, as it becomes balanced since the other players would have the same problems with the controls. 1UP.com editor Justin Haywald agreed, stating that while it made single player modes difficult, the game was meant to be played with friends. Game Informer editor Matt Helgeson, however, found the motion controls to be good, commenting that other developers should learn from Nintendo. In spite of this, fellow Game Informer editor Matthew Kato described the controls as being only so-so. GameShark editor Danielle Riendeau, however, described the controls as excellent, though adding that it occasionally misreads her shots. In the first four days of the Wii version's release in Japan, Mario Power Tennis sold 56,000 copies. By January 3, 2010, it had sold 205,070 copies in Japan.|$|E

5|$|Shon the Piper is a 1913 American silent short {{historical}} romantic drama film {{directed by}} Otis Turner and starring Robert Z. Leonard.

The woman's father, refuses to let the two marry because he wants his daughter to marry the Laird of the Isla. At the wedding, Shon steals Madge away and a battle ensues between the clans. The film was produced the 101 Bison Film Company and released on September 30, 1913. The film saw a widespread national release and garnered <b>some</b> <b>positive</b> attention. It was claimed that Lon Chaney appeared in this film, but this has been disputed. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

25|$|Despite <b>some</b> <b>positive</b> {{critical}} notice, {{only after}} his best {{years as a}} writer did Thompson achieve a measure of fame.
