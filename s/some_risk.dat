5|$|Official Church {{teaching}} {{allows for}} medical procedures and treatments {{intended to protect}} or restore the mother's health if {{she would be in}} mortal danger without them, even when such procedures carry <b>some</b> <b>risk</b> of death to the fetus.

5|$|The {{most common}} predators of greater noctule bat are barn owl (Tyto alba) and Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo). The greater noctule bat {{generally}} leaves its roost to forage {{after it is}} already completely dark outside, this coincides with the general time that the two mentioned owl species hunt. There is also <b>some</b> <b>risk</b> to the greater noctule from parasitism between bats.|$|E
5|$|As a Senator, Gravel became {{nationally known}} for his {{forceful}} but unsuccessful attempts to end the draft during the War in Vietnam and for putting the Pentagon Papers into the public record in 1971 at <b>some</b> <b>risk</b> to himself. He conducted an unusual campaign for the Democratic nomination in 1972 for Vice President of the United States, and then {{played a crucial role}} in getting Congressional approval for the Trans-Alaska pipeline in 1973. He was re-elected to the Senate in 1974, but gradually alienated most of his Alaskan constituencies and his bid for a third term was defeated in a primary election in 1980.|$|E

5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>risk</b> factors {{influence}} {{the location of}} DVT within the body. In isolated distal DVT, the profile of risk factors appears distinct from proximal DVT. Transient factors, such as surgery and immobilization, appear to dominate, whereas thrombophilias and age {{do not seem to}} increase risk. In upper-extremity DVT, the most important risk factor is having a central venous catheter, and thoracic outlet syndrome also increases risk.|$|E
5|$|The precise {{mechanisms}} of bubble formation {{and the damage}} they cause {{has been the subject}} of medical research for a considerable time and several hypotheses have been advanced and tested. Tables and algorithms for predicting the outcome of decompression schedules for specified hyperbaric exposures have been proposed, tested, and used, and usually found to be of some use but not entirely reliable. Decompression remains a procedure with <b>some</b> <b>risk,</b> but this has been reduced and is generally considered acceptable for dives within the well-tested range of commercial, military and recreational diving.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of decompression sickness {{are known to}} be caused by damage resulting from the formation and growth of bubbles of inert gas within the tissues and by blockage of arterial blood supply to tissues by gas bubbles and other emboli consequential to bubble formation and tissue damage.

25|$|While {{the vast}} {{majority}} of catfish are harmless to humans, a few species are known to present <b>some</b> <b>risk.</b> Many catfish species have “stings” (actually non-venomous in most cases) embedded behind their fins; thus precautions must be taken when handling them.|$|E

25|$|All sexual {{behaviors}} that involve {{contact with the}} bodily fluids of another person should be considered to contain <b>some</b> <b>risk</b> of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.

25|$|A dozen {{inflammatory}} {{diseases of}} the immune system can attribute <b>some</b> <b>risk</b> to the haplotype. Some disease like coeliac disease primarily associate with certain genes. While other diseases, like type 1 diabetes may have several, highly different, genes that attribute risk. Still other diseases, like myasthenia gravis have undetermined linkage to the haplotype.|$|E
25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>risk</b> {{factors for}} {{developing}} blood clots are considered higher that others. One scoring system analyzes the probability for clot formation by assigning a point value system to significant risk factors. The benefit of treating {{those who are}} at low risk of developing blood clots may not outweigh the higher risks of significant bleeding.|$|E
25|$|Maltreated {{children}} who experienced <b>some</b> <b>risk</b> factors (e.g., single parenting, limited maternal education, or family unemployment), showed lower ego-resilience and intelligence than nonmaltreated children. Furthermore, maltreated {{children are more}} likely than nonmaltreated children to demonstrate disruptive-aggressive, withdraw, and internalized behavior problems. Finally, ego-resiliency, and positive self-esteem were predictors of competent adaptation in the maltreated children.|$|E

25|$|Men are 25% {{more likely}} to suffer strokes than women, yet 60% of deaths from stroke occur in women. Since women live longer, they are older on average when they have their strokes and thus more often killed. <b>Some</b> <b>risk</b> factors for stroke apply only to women.

One concern with zona pellucida vaccination, in particular, is that in certain cases {{it appears to be}} correlated with ovarian pathogenesis. However, ovarian disease has not been observed in every trial of zona pellucida vaccination, and when observed, has not always been irreversible.|$|E
