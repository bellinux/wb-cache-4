500|$|The Vilnius Palace of Concerts and Sports (Koncertų ir sporto rūmai), {{built in}} 1971 in the southernmost part of Žirmūnai {{in the middle}} of the former cemetery, is an example of Soviet Constructivism and Brutalist architecture, {{remarkable}} for its vessel-like exterior. The Palace, once one of the architectonic icons of Soviet Vilnius, was, until the 1990s, a major venue for sporting events, especially local and international basketball matches, as well as concerts and shows. Its seating capacity is about 4,400. On 2223 October 1988 the building hosted the <b>statutory</b> <b>meeting</b> of Sąjūdis, the Lithuanian political organization that led the struggle for Lithuanian independence; on 1415 January 1991, a public funeral for the victims of the January Events took place at the Palace. Later in the 1990s, the building was used as a temporary shopping mall where space was leased to small entrepreneurs for business exhibitions and fairs.
