2500|$|The {{peak of the}} {{training}} courses at the Marine Commandos is the combat diving course, which is only followed by {{a small number of}} highly capable and efficient members. An entrance examination is required. [...] This examination involves 9km of swimming, 52meters of <b>underwater</b> <b>crossing,</b> in addition to running, push ups, and sit ups. This course lasts for 18 months, and it is intended to prepare professional fighters capable of using the sea as a way to infiltrate onto the shores and conduct naval special operations and special operations behind enemy lines.|$|R
50|$|According to {{designers}} of Transneft, {{the building of}} the <b>underwater</b> <b>crossing</b> is ecologically safe. The decision on the use of open cut river and stream crossing is based on studies performed by employees of Transneft of possible ways of crossing a waterway, proceeding from geological and hydrological conditions of a section of the Lena River. According to engineers of Transneft, this crossing is unique in reliability. In addition, pump station number 14 is {{on the bank of the}} Lena river right after the bridge. This measure lowers pressure in the pipe.|$|R

There were a lot of problems for the designers and for the constructors too, due to a very difficult geography of the pipeline path (aerial, in water, in rocks etc.). High technical level equipment was used for the filtering and compression stations. Between the geographic difficulties can be mentioned the <b>underwater</b> <b>crossing</b> of Danube, the crossing of Dobrogea-Hercinic mountains and the under-crossing of road...|$|R
50|$|Shorter than {{following}} classes, Skipjack {{lacked the}} space to be upgraded with newer systems, meaning that in her later years she had second-class sonar equipment and fire-control systems. Despite these limitations, she remained an effective attack submarine {{through to the end}} of her career. She received a new seven-bladed propeller during a refit between 1973 and 1976—replacing the noisier five-bladed propeller with which she had set a trans-Atlantic <b>underwater</b> <b>crossing</b> record in an early return from a forward deployment in the Mediterranean - quieted her considerably but also reduced her speed noticeably.|$|R

5000|$|At {{the same}} time that the <b>underwater</b> <b>crossing</b> of line 7 was completed, line 10's tunnel from Maubert to Jussieu was also completed. The route crossed {{intersection}} in the direction of Monge by a flying junction. On 21 April 1931, the underwater tunnel of line 7 was completed up to the station of Jussieu. [...] The completion of this station necessitated a considerable amount of work with regards to its location under the Halle-aux-Vins, upon which the Faculté des sciences de Jussieu is located. Here, the tracks are supported by concrete on both sides, and those of lines 7 and 10 lie side-by-side.|$|R

50|$|Local {{folklore}} {{says that}} a Spanish priest from the mainland saw the Island from across the Lamon bay. He was curious as to what lay in that island and its inhabitants. The Spanish priest crossed the bay on the boat and founded a church at what is today barangay Gordon. The church today is <b>underwater</b> but the <b>cross</b> can still be seen.|$|R
50|$|In 1870, the {{telegraph}} line was established and Woody Island {{was connected to}} the mainland and Maryborough. The line <b>crossed</b> <b>underwater</b> from Urangan and was carried on iron poles imported from England up to the Middle Bluff lighthouse. In 1903, {{the telegraph}} line {{was connected to the}} Sandy Cape Lightstation from the Middle Bluff light. The line was carried on iron poles down to the eastern shore of the Island to a point known as Jefferies Beach, where the cable again went underwater to Fraser Island.|$|R
50|$|The fourth harbour {{crossing}} {{is being}} proposed in Hong Kong as the fourth <b>underwater</b> tunnel to <b>cross</b> the Victoria Harbour {{to ease the}} traffic through the Cross-Harbour Tunnel. Even though the Western Harbour Crossing, operated by CITIC Pacific Limited, was built for this purpose, the tolls for crossing is triple the rates of the Cross-Harbour Tunnel, proving the Western Harbour Crossing ineffective in diverting traffic from the Cross-Harbour Tunnel. Around this time, a new tunnel between North Point and Kowloon Bay was suggested to relieve the stress on the Cross-Harbour Tunnel.|$|R
50|$|History. Diving in the Canadian Army {{began in}} the 1960s when, {{as a result of}} the {{introduction}} of amphibious vehicles, it was essential to provide a diving capability to the safety organization for the swimming of the vehicles. Amphibious operations also required a better capability for the <b>underwater</b> reconnaissance of <b>crossing</b> sites. Following trials in 1966, diving sections were established in engineer units in 1969. Once the diving capability was established, additional tasks were added to make combat diving an extension of combat engineering into the water. Other tasks such as obstacle construction and breaching, employing and detecting landmines and limited underwater construction were added to the safety standby and reconnaissance tasks.|$|R
2500|$|O'Shaughnessy's {{experimental}} set-up of 1851–52 consisted of both overhead and underground lines; the latter included <b>underwater</b> ones that <b>crossed</b> two rivers, the Hooghly and the Haldi. [...] The overhead line was constructed by welding uninsulated iron rods, 13½ {{feet long and}} 3/8inch wide, end to end. [...] These lines, which weighed 1,250 pounds per mile, were held aloft by fifteen-foot lengths of bamboo, planted into the ground at equal intervals—200 to the mile—and covered with a layer each of coal tar and pitch for insulation. [...] The underwater cables had been manufactured in England and consisted of copper wire covered with gutta-percha. [...] Furthermore, {{in order to protect}} the cables from dragging ship anchors, the cables were attached to the links of a [...] chain cable. An underwater cable of length 2,070 yards was laid across the Hooghly river at Diamond Harbour, and another, 1,400 yards long, was laid across the Haldi at Kedgeree.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The dynamic {{characteristics}} of large-scale tunnel element {{are very important}} for the process of immersion. In the paper, the motions and stress of the element under wave actions were studied. The linear wave diffraction theory and the three-dimensional source distribution method were applied to calculate the wave loads and motion responses of the tunnel element under different incident wave conditions. In the study, there have no cable on the element. On the basis of the above theories, the stress and the motions of the element were studied. The first order wave forces and the second order wave force were deduced, and the motions equation was made. An immersed tunnel [1] is a kind of <b>underwater</b> transporting passage <b>crossing</b> a river, a canal, a gulf or a strait. By in turn dredging a trench on the river or sea bottom, transporting the prefabricated tunnel elements and immersing them one by one to the trench, connecting the elements to one another by water pressure, backfilling the trench and installing equipments inside, an immersed tunnel is built. Because of shallow depth and good waterproof, immersed tunnel is becoming the main construction method of underwater tunnel. The sinking scheme depends on the motions and stress of the element, so it is necessary to analyze them. The paper is to discuss the movement and stress of the element under wave conditions. When the element moves on the flui...|$|R
40|$|The 3 -D unstructured-grid, Finite-Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) {{was used}} to {{simulate}} the flows in Discovery Passage including the adjoining Lower Campbell River, British Columbia, Canada. Challenges in the studies include the strong tidal currents (e. g., up to 7. 8 m/s in Seymour Narrows) and tailrace discharges, small-scale topographic features and steep bottom slopes, and stratification affected by the Campbell River freshwater discharges. Two applications of high resolution 3 -D FVCOM modeling were conducted. One is for the Lower Campbell River extending upstream {{as far as the}} John Hart Hydroelectric dam. The horizontal resolution varies from 0. 27 m to 32 m in the unstructured triangular mesh to resolve the tailrace flow. The bottom elevation decreases ~ 14 m within the distance of ~ 1. 4 km along the river. This pioneering FVCOM river modeling demonstrated a very good performance in simulating the river flow structures. The second application is to compute ocean currents immediately above the seabed along the present <b>underwater</b> electrical cable <b>crossing</b> routes across Discovery Passage. Higher resolution was used near the bottom with inter-layer spacing ranging from 0. 125 to 0. 0005 of total water depth. The model behaves very well in simulating the strong tidal currents in the area at high resolution in both the horizontal and vertical. One year maximum near bottom tidal current along the routes was then analyzed using the model results...|$|R
