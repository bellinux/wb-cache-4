40|$|The {{mechanical}} signal(s) {{that may}} be important in regulating the number of sarcomeres in series in skeletal muscle fibres or fascicles (sarcomere number) remain(s) speculative, {{in part because the}} in vivo mechanical environment of muscle has not yet been defined during sarcomere number perturbations. In the present study, measurements of the in vivo mechanical environment were used to test the hypothesis that increasing muscle excursion results in increased <b>serial</b> sarcomere <b>addition</b> in growing animals. The tibialis anterior (TA) was released from its retinacular restraint at the ankle joint to increase muscle excursion in 4 -week-old female New Zealand White rabbits. Twelve weeks post release, muscle excursion and sarcomere number were significantly increased for released TAs compared with control TAs. General cage activity over a 24 h period and in vivo ankle joint kinematics of the experimental leg during hopping on a treadmill were not significantly different between control and release groups, suggesting that altered animal and joint activity patterns were not responsible for the increased <b>serial</b> sarcomere <b>addition</b> associated with TA release. In vivo TA forces during hopping and during a large force-producing foot-flicking motion were significantly decreased in released TAs compared with control TAs. Chronically decreased force production may {{have been involved in the}} decreased longitudinal tendon growth observed for the released TA compared with the control TA, which, in turn, may have stimulated the increase in <b>serial</b> sarcomere <b>addition.</b> However, increasing force production of the released TA by partial ablation of the extensor digitorum longus did not inhibit the increase in <b>serial</b> sarcomere <b>addition.</b> The results of this study support the hypothesis that increasing excursion results in increased <b>serial</b> sarcomere <b>addition</b> in growing animals and, when combined with the results of previous studies indicating that decreasing excursion results in decreased <b>serial</b> sarcomere <b>addition,</b> support the working hypothesis that excursion is important in regulating sarcomere number in growing animals...|$|R

40|$|Introduction and summary: Hardware {{capabilities}} for integer arithmetic generally include addition, multiplication, {{and division}} with precision k typically chosen as 16, 32 or 64. Multiplication and division are often implemented by recursive bit serial algorithms employing O(k) <b>serial</b> <b>additions</b> {{to avoid the}} size and power requirements of a large multiplier. The integer addition and multiplication operations realised are effectively `exact' residue arithmetic operations with modulo 2. Hardware support for applications where fast residue arithmetic computation is desirable is typically limited to only residue addition and multiplication. There {{is a need to}} find efficiently implementable algorithms for other fundamental residue operations for the `hardware friendly' modulus 2. Furthermore, for implementations where hardware support does not include a large multiplier, there is a particular need for additive bit-serial algorithms for these additional residue operations.

40|$|Abstract. The {{assessment}} {{and treatment of}} traumatic brain injury (TBI) has become a difficult challenge for the DoD medical health system. Clinical neuropsychologists {{are being asked to}} make statements regarding a soldier’s functional skills, ability to return to active duty, and competence in tasks of community living. Given the increasing prevalence of blast injuries to the head, and the fact that many brain injuries may have no external marker of injury, there is need for researching innovative assessment methods in detecting blast-related brain injury. To address these issues, two virtual reality-based Paced Auditory/Visual <b>Serial</b> <b>Addition</b> Tests (PA/VSAT) were developed that involve the participant being immersed in a Virtual Middle Eastern City as <b>serial</b> <b>addition</b> stimuli are presented. This study is an initial validation of the VRPASAT and VRPVSAT as assessments of neurocognitive functioning.

Spectrin aliquots were added to a suspension of FPE-labelled LUVETs to elucidate both the type of charge involved and the dissociation constants for spectrin binding to various lipids. All binding experiments showed serial increases in FPE fluorescence intensity upon <b>serial</b> <b>additions</b> of spectrin, indicative of increasing positive charge at the membrane surface. This proves {{for the first time}} that although exhibiting an overall net negative charge, spectrin binds to lipid surfaces by presenting positive charges to the lipid surface.

A Kd of 0. 14 ± 0. 12 μM was found for spectrin binding to FPE-labelled phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine (PC/PS) LUVETs at 22 °C in high salt conditions.

40|$|Since {{pharmaceuticals}} {{cannot be}} used in space until liver and kidney dysfunctions are corrected, and with invariable malabsorption, it appears {{there is no alternative}} other than to use subcutaneous magnesium (Mg) replacements in the presence of deficiencies and use of gene therapy. I suggest beginning with the correction of as many as four gene deficiencies: atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), nitric oxide (NO), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and erythropoietin (EPO), all as well as Mg related to perfusion and angiogenesis. There is no evidence of significant lunar radiation levels {{in the absence of a}} solar storm. It could then be determined whether this has resulted in correction of liver and kidney dysfunction. If this persists, <b>serial</b> <b>additions</b> of gene therapy will be required determining the effect of each individual gene trial on organ function. Microgravity and endothelial gaps with leaks trigger reduced plasma volume. Partial correction by use of a plasma volume substitute and development of a delivery device may reduce complexity of gene therapy.
