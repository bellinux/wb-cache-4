25|$|A {{significant}} portion of the Saudi Aramco workforce consists of geophysicists and geologists. Saudi Aramco has been exploring for oil and gas reservoirs since 1982. Most of this process takes place at the Exploration and Petroleum Engineering Center (EXPEC). Originally, Saudi Aramco used Cray Supercomputers (CRAY-1M) in its EXPEC Computer Center (ECC) to assist in processing the colossal quantity of data obtained during exploration and in 2001, ECC decided to use Linux clusters as a replacement for the decommissioned Cray systems. ECC installed a new supercomputing system in late 2009 with a disk storage capacity of 1,050 terabytes (i.e, exceeding one petabyte), the largest <b>storage</b> <b>installation</b> in Saudi Aramco's history to support its exploration in the frontier areas and the Red Sea.|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} {{summarizes the}} requirements and best practices for implementing international nuclear safeguards at independent spent fuel <b>storage</b> <b>installations</b> (ISFSIs), {{also known as}} Away-from- Reactor (AFR) <b>storage</b> facilities. These <b>installations</b> may provide wet or dry storage of spent fuel, although the safeguards guidance herein focuses on dry storage facilities. In principle, the safeguards guidance applies to both wet and dry storage. The reason for focusing on dry independent spent fuel <b>storage</b> <b>installations</b> {{is that this is}} one of the fastest growing nuclear installations worldwide. Independent spent fuel <b>storage</b> <b>installations</b> are typically outside of the safeguards nuclear material balance area (MBA) of the reactor. They may be located on the reactor site, but are generally considered by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the State Regulator/SSAC to be a separate facility. The need for this guidance is becoming increasingly urgent as more and more nuclear power plants move their spent fuel from resident spent fuel ponds to independent spent fuel <b>storage</b> <b>installations.</b> The safeguards requirements and best practices described herein are also relevant to the design and construction of regional independent spent fuel <b>storage</b> <b>installations</b> that nuclear power plant operators are starting to consider in the absence of a national long-term geological spent fuel repository. The following document has been prepared in support of two of the three foundational pillars for implementing Safeguards-by-Design (SBD). These are: i) defining the relevant safeguards requirements, and ii) defining the best practices for meeting the requirements. This document was prepared with the design of the latest independent dry spent fuel <b>storage</b> <b>installations</b> in mind and was prepared specifically as an aid for designers of commercial nuclear facilities to help them understand the relevant international requirements that follow from a country’s safeguards agreement with the IAEA. If these requirements are understood at the earliest stages of facility design, it will help eliminate the costly retrofit of facilities that has occurred in the past to accommodate nuclear safeguards, and will help the IAEA implement nuclear safeguards worldwide, especially in countries building their first nuclear facilities. It is also hoped that this guidance document will promote discussion between the IAEA, State Regulator/SSAC, Project Design Team, and Facility Owner/Operator at an early stage to ensure that new ISFSIs will be effectively and efficiently safeguarded. This is intended to be a living document, since the international nuclear safeguards requirements may be subject to revision over time. More importantly, the practices by which the requirements are met are continuously modernized by the IAEA and facility operators for greater efficiency and cost effectiveness. As these improvements are made, it is recommended that the subject guidance document be updated and revised accordingly...|$|R

50|$|The company {{operated}} the Humboldt Bay Power Plant, Unit 3 in Eureka, California. It {{is the oldest}} commercial nuclear plant in California and its maximum output was 65 MWe. The plant operated for 13 years, until 1976 when it was shut down for seismic retrofitting. New regulations enacted after the Three Mile Island accident, however, rendered the plant unprofitable and it was never restarted. Unit 3 is currently in decommissioning phase and scheduled to be fully dismantled in 2015.

50|$|Spent fuel pools (SFP) are storage pools for {{spent fuel}} from nuclear reactors.

A reactor's pool is specially designed for the reactor in which the fuel was used and situated at the reactor site. An away-from-reactor, Independent Spent Fuel <b>Storage</b> <b>Installation</b> (ISFSI), {{such as the one}} located at the Morris Operation, is also sometimes used. In many countries, the fuel assemblies, after being in the reactor for 3 to 6 years, are stored underwater for 10 to 20 years before being sent for reprocessing or dry cask storage.

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, {{the need for}} {{alternative}} storage in the United States began to grow when pools at many nuclear reactors began to fill up with stored spent fuel. As {{there was not a}} national nuclear storage facility in operation at the time, utilities began looking at options for storing spent fuel. Dry cask storage was determined to be a practical option for storage of spent fuel and preferable to leaving large concentrations of spent fuel in cooling tanks.The first dry <b>storage</b> <b>installation</b> in the US was licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in 1986 at the Surry Nuclear Power Plant in Virginia, at [...] Spent fuel is currently stored in dry cask systems at a growing number of power plant sites, and at an interim facility located at the Idaho National Laboratory near Idaho Falls, Idaho. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission estimates that many of the nuclear power plants in the United States will be out of room in their spent fuel pools by 2015, most likely requiring the use of temporary storage of some kind.
