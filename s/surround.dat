40|$|We present {{evidence}} from asymmetric colour-matching experiments which {{strongly suggests that}} uniform <b>surrounds</b> evoke induction effects of a very peculiar nature, not representative of colour- induction effects in general. We compared the induction effects resulting from using a pair of uniform <b>surrounds</b> with those resulting from using a corresponding pair of variegated <b>surrounds.</b> The data curves obtained with variegated <b>surrounds</b> could be well described by simple von Kries scaling. The uniform <b>surrounds,</b> however, yielded a curious and unexpected result, namely a sharp step in the data curve indicating that a range of clearly distinguishable comparison patches were matched by identical test patches. Outside the region of this step, the data curves obtained with both kinds of <b>surrounds</b> were practically the same. These data can {{be accounted for by}} assuming that the induction effect observed in uniform <b>surrounds</b> is the result of two distinct mechanisms: a simple gain control mechanism, which is also triggered by variegated <b>surrounds,</b> and a contrast-coding mechanism specific to the uniform <b>surrounds.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|Albert and Joseph follow Dares {{in having}} Achilles behead Troilus {{as he tries}} to rise after his horse falls.

30|$|In {{the dynamic}} {{equilibrium}} system of hydraulic support and <b>surrounding</b> rock, the <b>surrounding</b> rock deformation and instability {{induced by the}} mining stress field jointly determine the system stability. The hydraulic support could adapt and influence the process of <b>surrounding</b> rock motion by actively adjusting stress state to protect the safety working space in working face. In other words, the hydraulic support’s supporting intensity should adapt the <b>surrounding</b> rock’s strength to reduce the impact of dynamic load from the <b>surrounding</b> rock by actively protecting and reasonably yielding. The hydraulic support’s supporting stiffness should adapt the <b>surrounding</b> rock’s stiffness to change the dynamic load location of roof by optimizing the structural stiffness of hydraulic support, providing safe working space. The support system’s stability should adapt the <b>surrounding</b> rock’s stability to control the dynamic instability of <b>surrounding</b> rock based on the stability of hydraulic support itself.|$|R

5|$|In 2011, Townshend and {{longtime}} Who engineer Bob Pridden remixed the album, {{resulting in a}} deluxe 5-disc box set. Unlike earlier reissues, this set contains two discs of demos, including some songs that were dropped from the final running order of the album, and a selection of songs in 5.1 <b>surround</b> sound. The box set came with a 100-page book including an essay by Townshend about the album sessions, with photos. In 2014, the album was released on Blu-ray Audio featuring a brand-new remix of the entire album by Townshend and Pridden in 5.1 <b>surround</b> sound as well the 2011 Deluxe Edition stereo remix and the original 1973 stereo LP mix.|$|E

40|$|The {{visibility}} of a grating patch is altered {{when it is}} <b>surrounded</b> by another grating. Here, we determined the {{visibility of}} a grating patch when it is <b>surrounded</b> by complex images of varying second-order statistics. The 86 correct detection threshold of a 256 grey-level grating patch (1. 00 deg × 0. 13 deg, spatial frequency 6 cycles deg- 1) was measured when it was <b>surrounded</b> by different complex images (4 deg × 4 deg). The <b>surrounding</b> images were derived from either real natural images, or from random luminance patterns, filtered to different second-order statistics. The detection threshold of the grating in natural images {{was found to be}} highest when the <b>surrounding</b> images had the characteristic statistics of real-world scenes. The detection threshold of a grating <b>surrounded</b> by filtered random-luminance patterns was highest when the <b>surrounds</b> were, in comparison to natural scenes, slightly de-correlated. The results show that the detection thresholds of gratings are affected by the statistics of their <b>surrounding</b> stimuli. The thresholds are higher when the <b>surrounding</b> stimuli have the statistics of natural images...|$|R
