40|$|BackgroundShaking and smothering in {{response}} to infant crying are forms of child abuse that often result in death. Unintended pregnancy and young motherhood are risk factors of such child maltreatment that are often comorbid, {{few studies have examined}} their synergistic effect on shaking and <b>smothering</b> <b>of</b> infants. We examined the synergistic effects of unintended pregnancy and young motherhood on shaking and <b>smothering</b> among caregivers <b>of</b> infants in Japan. MethodsIn this retrospective cohort study, a questionnaire was administered to caregivers enrolled for a health check for 3 - to 4 -month-old infants between October 2013 and February 2014 in Nagoya City, Japan. The questionnaire data were linked to those from pregnancy notification forms registered at municipalities and included information on women’s age and feelings about their pregnancy (N[*]=[*] 4, 159). Data were analyzed using logistic regression analysis in 2016. ResultsShaking and <b>smothering</b> <b>of</b> 3 - to 4 -month-old infants occurred at least once in the past month in 2. 0 and 1. 5 % of cases, respectively. Of all participants, 24. 8 % reported unintended pregnancy while 7. 3 % were younger than 25 [*]years old. Infants of young mothers (under 25 [*]years old) with unintended pregnancy were 2. 77 [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 15 – 6. 68] and 5. 61 (95 % CI: 2. 40 – 13. 1) {{times more likely to be}} shaken and smothered, respectively, than those of older mothers with intended pregnancy. In addition, the odds ratio of young mothers with unintended pregnancy regarding smothering was significantly higher than that of older mothers with unintended pregnancy (odds ratio: 2. 12; p[*]=[*] 0. 02). ConclusionOur findings suggest a synergistic effect of unintended pregnancy and young motherhood on <b>smothering.</b> Infants <b>of</b> young mothers with unintended pregnancy are at greater risk <b>of</b> abuse, especially <b>smothering.</b> Prevention strategies are required for young women with unintended pregnancies...|$|R

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the multi-scale {{variability}} <b>of</b> <b>beach</b> profiles. This includes the spatial variability over a range of scales <b>of</b> surveyed <b>beach</b> profiles and the complex temporal variability <b>of</b> <b>beach</b> elevation at given positions along the profile. The aims of this work are to characterize the variability <b>of</b> <b>beach</b> profiles in both time and space, to identify the predominant spatial and temporal patterns <b>of</b> <b>beach</b> profile changes, to identify the extreme profile changes due to infrequent storms/storm groups, {{to understand the nature}} <b>of</b> <b>beach</b> profile change in depth, to quantify the non-stationarity <b>of</b> <b>beach</b> profile and to provide insight into the prediction <b>of</b> <b>beach</b> profiles. This thesis includes a critical literature review of the existing profile models, such as numerical and data-driven models, to predict beach profiles. Particular focus is on the data-driven models since they characterize the beach in a site-dependent manner. The main weakness of the existing data-driven approaches {{is that many of the}} techniques assume stationarity and yet the processes in question are non-stationary, which necessitates more advanced techniques for investigating the variability <b>of</b> <b>beach</b> profiles. Hence in this thesis the wavelet technique is introduced, which is a relatively new technique. It is also shown how the use of a wavelet basis for decomposing the profile signals spatially allows a more satisfactory value for the depth of closure associated with a data set to be defined. Particular interests are in the beach profile data from the Field Research Facility (FRF) at Duck, North Carolina, USA. The field data and previous works by other researchers are introduced and preliminary studies are conducted including the interpolation of data and the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis. A connection is established between EOF and wavelet analysis. In addition to the identification of basic patterns <b>of</b> <b>beach</b> profile changes, emphasis is given to the non-stationary investigation <b>of</b> <b>beach</b> profile changes in both time and space locally. In this way, the infrequent events are identified at different temporal scales. The responses <b>of</b> <b>beach</b> profile changes to different wave/storm conditions are discussed. The intermittent character <b>of</b> <b>beach</b> profile change is displayed in both time and space, providing much insight to the argument by Southgate and Moller (2000). Also, the depth of closure is presented by analysing the local components of wavelet variance in space, which is scale-dependent. The results agree with Larson and Kraus(1994). The wavelet analysis is validated on the beach profile data at the Coastal Research Station (CRS), Lubiatowo, Poland. Focus is on the spatial variability across the beach profile. Due to the multi-bar system, the spatial scale contents <b>of</b> <b>beach</b> profile changes at Lubiatowo are more complicated than Duck. The predominant spatial scales indicate that wave breaking may be the major factor of bar formation at this site. This is consistent with Pruszak et al. (1997) ...|$|R
40|$|Global {{sea-level rise}} {{of up to}} 0. 6 m is {{predicted}} in the next 100 years. In areas where coastal structures prevent landward migration <b>of</b> <b>beaches,</b> a major impact of sea-level rise will be a loss <b>of</b> <b>beach</b> habitat, with repercussions for beach-dependent organisms such as sea turtles. Setback regulations, which prohibit construction within a set distance from the sea, {{have the potential to}} mitigate loss <b>of</b> <b>beach</b> area by providing a buffer zone which allows for the natural movement <b>of</b> <b>beaches</b> in response to perturbation. The potential impact of a rise in sea level on 11 important sea turtle nesting beaches in Barbados under a range of setback regulations was determined. Three sea-level rise scenarios were modelled under five different setback regulations (10, 30, 50, 70 and 90 m). Beach area was lost from all beaches under all sea-level rise scenarios with a 10 and 30 m setback, from some beaches with a 50 m setback and from one beach with a 70 m setback. No beach area was lost with a 90 m setback distance. Sea turtles nest within a range <b>of</b> <b>beach</b> elevations and there was an overall loss <b>of</b> <b>beach</b> habitat within the preferred nesting elevation range with both a 10 and 30 m setback under all sea-level rise scenarios. Considerable variation in the extent <b>of</b> <b>beach</b> and nesting area loss was observed. The implementation and enforcement of adequate setback regulations have the potential to maintain the ecological and economic function <b>of</b> <b>beaches</b> in the face of extensive coastal development and sea-level rise...|$|R
