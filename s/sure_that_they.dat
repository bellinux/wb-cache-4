One of the tracks is used to allow for Rockaway Park Shuttle trains to relay and {{to go back into}} service to the Rockaways, while the other track is called the Far Rockaway Test Track.

5|$|Allan Arkush and Kring {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} on The Post Show that many parts of the finale were re-shot due to the Writers' Strike. Kring and Arkush commented that they re-shot the scene in which Peter telekenetically caught the virus. In the original cut, the virus was to shatter and be released. Kring admitted that the virus being released was to play a huge role in Volume 3, however, they decided to go into a different direction and re-shoot the ending, allowing Peter to catch the virus and destroy it. Kring also commented that the scenes where Matt, Peter and Nathan were talking in the vault were rewritten in and added later, as well as the Press Conference scene and the scene with Angela Petrelli talking on the cell phone. Kring and Arkush stated that the ending had to be rewritten and re-shot because they did not know when the show would return to air, due to the Writer's Strike, and they wanted to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> tied up all the loose ends.|$|E
5|$|In the {{economic}} field, the document addressed {{the lack of}} a bourgeoisie that could turn the political changes into economic development, and proposed to overcome this lack with strong state interventionism. Mariano Moreno proposed that the state invest 200 or 300 million in factories, manufacturing, arts, agriculture, navigation, and other critical areas. There would be no risk of bankruptcy because the state would manage the businesses. With the money generated, the state would then seek seeds and tools, and ultimately allow the continent to be economically autarchic. The initial money that the state would need to become such an active economic force would come from the mines in Potosi, where the slavers had nearly 500 or 600 million. Moreno proposed simply to confiscate the money and nationalize the mines. He reasoned that five or six thousand people would be harmed by such action, but eighty or a hundred thousand would benefit. The state would not manage those areas indefinitely; Moreno proposed that this should be done only until there was a strong economic activity in each area, and then the state would just observe, making <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> followed the laws enacted for the common good of society.|$|E

5|$|The {{excavation}} {{and raising}} {{of the ship}} in the 1970s and early 1980s meant that diving operations ceased, even though modern scaffolding {{and part of the}} bow were left on the seabed. The pressure on conservators to treat tens of thousands of artefacts and the high costs of conserving, storing and displaying the finds and the ship meant that there were no funds available for diving. In 2002, the UK Ministry of Defence announced plans to build two new aircraft carriers. Because of the massive size of the new vessels, the outlet from Portsmouth needed to be surveyed to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could sail no matter the tide. The planned route for the underwater channel ran close to the Mary Rose wrecksite, which meant that funding was supplied to survey and excavate the site once more. Even though the planned carriers were down-sized enough to not require alteration of Portsmouth outlet, the excavations had already exposed timbers and were completed in 2005. Among the most important finds was the ten-metre (32feet) stem, the forward continuation of the keel, which provided more exact details about the original profile of the ship.|$|E

25|$|Anti-virus {{programs}} are not always effective against new viruses, even those that use non-signature-based methods that should detect new viruses.

The Turks nearly destroyed the crusaders’ army near {{the mountains of}} Paphlagonia at Mersivan.

The Turks had been troublesome to the Latins for some days, at last making certain that they went where Kilij Arslan I {{wanted them to be}} and making <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> only found a small amount of supplies.|$|E

His final proposal is to create an Innovation Council that reviews copyright and patent policies to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> achieve their goals. Lessig has written several books on intellectual property, and in 2002 argued in front of the Supreme Court for copyright limitations.|$|E

25|$|The {{biggest problem}} with prosecuting Mengistu for {{genocide}} {{is that his}} actions did not necessarily target a particular group. They were directed against anybody who was opposing his government, and they were generally much more political than based on any ethnic targeting. In contrast, the irony is the Ethiopian government itself {{has been accused of}} genocide based on atrocities committed in Gambella. I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> qualify as genocide either. But in Gambella, the incidents, which were well documented in a human rights report of about 2 years ago, were clearly directed at a particular group, the tribal group, the Anuak.|$|E

Then, the rouge test was performed using a dot of rouge below the child's right eye. For their modified testing, the experimenter introduced a doll with a rouge spot under its eye and asked the child to help clean the doll. The experimenter would ask up to three times before cleaning the doll themselves. The doll was then put away, and the mirror test performed using a rouge dot on the child's face. These modifications were shown {{to increase the number of}} self-recognisers.|$|E
