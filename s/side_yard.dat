5|$|It {{was again}} {{proposed}} {{as part of}} the New York City bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics. The City wanted to get funding before July 2005, at which time the International Olympic Committee would vote on funding. However, due to shortfalls in the MTA's Capital Program, as well as preexisting funding for the Second Avenue Subway and East Side Access, the MTA could not pay to fund the extension. After a proposal for the West Side Stadium, an Olympic stadium to be located above the nearby West <b>Side</b> <b>Yard,</b> was rejected in 2005, New York City quickly lost their Olympic bid.|$|E
5|$|The park {{is built}} on the disused {{southern}} viaduct section of a New York Central Railroad line called the West Side Line. Originating in the Lower West Side of Manhattan, the park runs from Gansevoort Street – three blocks below 14th Street – in the Meatpacking District, through Chelsea, to {{the northern edge of}} the West <b>Side</b> <b>Yard</b> on 34th Street near the Javits Center. Formerly, the West Side Line went as far south as a railroad terminal at Spring Street, just north of Canal Street. However, most of the southern section was demolished in 1960, with another small portion being demolished in 1991.|$|E
5|$|An {{extension}} of the Flushing Line was then proposed {{as part of the}} New York City bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics. The City wanted to get funding before July 2005, at which time the International Olympic Committee would vote on funding. However, due to shortfalls in the MTA's Capital Program, as well as preexisting funding for the Second Avenue Subway and East Side Access, the MTA could not pay to fund the extension. After a proposal for the West Side Stadium, an Olympic stadium to be located above the nearby West <b>Side</b> <b>Yard,</b> was rejected in 2005, New York City quickly lost their Olympic bid. However, in a report entitled No. 7 Subway Extension– Hudson Yards Rezoning and Development Program, the government of New York City, devised a rezoning plan for the Hudson Yards area and proposed two new subway stations to serve that area. The subway extension was approved following the successful rezoning of about 60 blocks from 28th to 43rd Streets, which became the Hudson Yards neighborhood.|$|E

50|$|After 1945, postwar housing {{filled in}} the {{remaining}} acres, particularly, on those streets just off Bronson Avenue where house construction had declined {{in the years after}} 1930. <b>Side</b> <b>yards</b> and vacant lots disappeared {{in the final stages of}} development.|$|R
25|$|In June 1987, a new storage yard, the West <b>Side</b> <b>Yard,</b> was opened. The {{yard was}} {{built as a}} result of train {{capacity}} issues at Penn Station that forced terminating LIRR trains to make unneeded non-passenger trips to storage yards on Long Island during midday. The West <b>Side</b> <b>Yard,</b> once opened, immediately increased train capacity through Penn Station. The yard is located between West 30th Street, West 33rd Street, 10th Avenue, and 12th Avenue, and it was previously used as a rail yard and freight terminal for the New York Central and later on the Penn Central until the 1970s. The yard was bought by the LIRR in 1980 and it built a new 30-track yard with a tunnel connection to Penn Station. The new yard permitted midday and overnight storage and the cleaning and inspection of 320 cars, which formerly had to be shuttled to yard locations at Jamaica or as far east as Babylon. The West <b>Side</b> <b>Yard</b> is named after John D. Caemmerer, a New York State Senator from East Williston who helped obtain $195.7 million for its construction. A state-of-the-art repair facility at Hillside was opened in 1989, exactly 100 years after the Morris Park shops opened, at a cost of $380 million.|$|E
25|$|The LIRR was {{severely}} affected by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. In {{anticipation of the}} storm, the LIRR was shut down on October 29, 2012. The railroad moved trains out of low-lying areas, such as the West <b>Side</b> <b>Yard,</b> to higher ground. As {{a result of the}} storm's record breaking storm surge, many parts of the system were inundated with water, including the East River Tunnels, the West <b>Side</b> <b>Yard,</b> and the Long Beach Branch. The Long Beach Branch resumed with limited diesel-operated service on November 14, whereas full service was restored on November 25, hours after the last of the three substations damaged along the line was restored. It took the railroad seven weeks to restore full rush hour service. However, the replacement of the East River Tunnels' two signal systems that were damaged in the hurricane has not yet been completed.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, New York Governor Mario Cuomo {{proposed}} {{using the}} West <b>Side</b> <b>Yard,</b> a 30-acre rail yard along the West Side of Manhattan and {{owned by the}} Metropolitan Transportation Authority, as the location for new stadium for the Yankees. However, Cuomo lost his re-election bid a few months later. By 1995, Steinbrenner had rejected 13 proposals to keep the Yankees in the Bronx.|$|E

The cellar is accessible through a diagonal door in the kitchen. A kitchen door opens onto a small <b>side</b> <b>yard,</b> the driveway, and a single-car garage—a frequent setting for get-togethers between the boys, their father, and the boys' friends.|$|E
5|$|In 1843, {{another group}} of planned Greek Revival townhouses was built at 160-168 Second Street.

25|$|However, {{just two}} months later, the deal broke down due to the late-2000s {{financial}} crisis. Not much later, the MTA chose the Related Companies and Goldman Sachs to develop Hudson Yards under the same conditions. In December 2009, the New York City Council approved Related Companies' revised plan for Hudson Yards, and the western portion of the West <b>Side</b> <b>Yard</b> was rezoned. Following the rail yards' successful rezoning, the MTA signed another 99-year lease to the air rights over the rail yard in May 2010. The air rights were signed over to a joint venture of Related Companies and Oxford Properties Group, which invested $400 million to build a platform above both the eastern and western portions of the yard on which to construct the buildings. Groundbreaking for 10 Hudson Yards, the first building, occurred on December 4, 2012.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] Hudson Yards project, {{the largest}} planned {{development}} ever {{built in the}} United States, was to be constructed over the existing at-grade West <b>Side</b> <b>Yard,</b> allowing LIRR trains {{to continue to be}} stored during midday hours. The land parcel is bordered by 30th Street and Chelsea on the south, Twelfth Avenue on the west, 33rd Street and Hell's Kitchen on the north, and Tenth Avenue on the east. Eleventh Avenue runs through the site, and splits the redevelopment project into two phases. To minimize construction impact on the LIRR's ability to store trains during midday and peak hours, caissons were drilled into bedrock throughout much of the site, over which the platform was to be built. However, only 38% of the ground level at West <b>Side</b> <b>Yard</b> was to be filled in with columns to support the development. Much of the platform itself will be built by a huge Manitowoc 18000 crane. The eastern platform, supporting the towers, comprises 16 bridges. The platform for the Eastern Rail Yard was completed in October 2015, and the western platform will be completed by 2016.|$|E
