40|$|This paper {{provides}} a detailed derivation {{of a full}} vehicle model, which {{may be used to}} simulate the behaviour of a vehicle in longitudinal direction. The 14 degrees of freedom (14 -DOF) vehicle model is integrated with an analytical tyre dynamics using Calspan tyre model. The full vehicle model was validated experimentally with an instrumented experimental vehicle based on the driver input from brake or throttle pedals. Several transient handling tests were performed, namely sudden acceleration and <b>sudden</b> <b>braking</b> test. Comparisons of the experimental result and model response with <b>sudden</b> <b>braking</b> and throttling imposed motion are made. The results of model validation show that the trends between simulation results and experimental data are almost similar with acceptable error. An adaptive PID control strategy was implemented on the validated full vehicle model to reduce unwanted vehicle motions in longitudinal direction during <b>sudden</b> <b>braking</b> and throttling manoeuvre. The results show that the proposed control structure is able to significantly improve the dynamic performance of the vehicle during <b>sudden</b> <b>braking</b> and <b>sudden</b> acceleration under various conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Traditionally, {{automotive}} {{brake rotors}} {{are made with}} cast iron. Besides having economical advantage, cast iron rotor provides many disadvantages due to its weight, such as reduction in fuel efficiency, increase in green house gas emission, and increase in noise, vibration and hardness. With the development of commercial aluminum composites, composite brake rotors are now manufactured. However, the present commercial composite materials are not specifically made for <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> and there are drawbacks. A major drawback is their poor elevated temperature property. In this paper, the unique properties offered by an aluminum composite for <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> is addressed, and an approach to compensate its properties for <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> is highlighted...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a derivation {{of a full}} vehicle model to study vehicle dynamics behaviour in longitudinal direction. The full vehicle model is then validated using an instrumented experimental vehicle based on the driver input from brake and throttle pedals. Two tests are performed {{for the purpose of}} model validation, namely, <b>sudden</b> <b>braking</b> and <b>sudden</b> acceleration test. The results of the validation show that the behaviours of the model closely follow the behaviour of a real vehicle. An active suspension control system is then developed on the validated full vehicle model to reduce unwanted vehicle motions during braking and throttling manoeuvres. The proposed controller structure for the active suspension system is gain scheduling PID control with pitch moment rejection loop. The results show that the proposed control structure is able to significantly improve the dynamic performance of the vehicle during <b>sudden</b> <b>braking</b> and <b>sudden</b> acceleration under various conditions...|$|R

40|$|In this study, two {{different}} ventilated brake discs were manufactured and their braking force performances and heat generations were investigated experimentally {{together with a}} solid disc. Braking force outputs were examined in <b>sudden</b> and continuous <b>braking</b> conditions and disc temperatures were simply measured in continuous braking conditions. Fourteen pedal forces were used in <b>sudden</b> <b>braking</b> tests and eight periodic measurements were executed in continuous braking tests. Experiment results showed that ventilation applications not only increased the brake force outputs up to 42. 6 %, but also reduced the heat formation on discs up to 31. 5 % depending on test conditions...|$|R
25|$|In {{the event}} of a loss of braking due to {{reservoir}} depletion, the engine driver may be able to regain control with an emergency <b>brake</b> <b>application,</b> as the emergency portion of each car's dual-compartment reservoir should be fully chargedit is not affected by normal service reductions. The triple valves detect an emergency reduction based on the rate of brake pipe pressure reduction. Therefore, as long as a sufficient volume of air can be rapidly vented from the brake pipe, each car's triple valve will cause an emergency <b>brake</b> <b>application.</b> However, if the brake pipe pressure is too low due to an excessive number of <b>brake</b> <b>applications,</b> an emergency application will not produce a large enough volume of air flow to trip the triple valves, leaving the engine driver with no means to stop the train.|$|R

This increases {{the scope of the}} model as it can now simulate <b>sudden</b> <b>braking</b> of the leader vehicle without causing collision or unrealistic deceleration of the subject vehicle.|$|R
