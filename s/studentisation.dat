40|$|For {{independent}} data, non-parametric bootstrap is realised by resampling {{the data}} with replacement. This approach fails for dependent data such as time series. If the data generating process {{is at least}} stationary and mixing, the blockwise bootstrap by drawing subsamples or blocks of the data saves the concept. For the blockwise bootstrap a blocklength has to be selected. We propose a method for selecting the optimal blocklength. To improve the finite size properties of the blockwise bootstrap, studentised statistics is considered. If the statistic can be represented as a smooth function model this <b>studentisation</b> can be approximated efficiently. The studentised blockwise bootstrap method is applied for testing hypotheses on medical time series...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} issue of {{detecting}} explosive behaviour in economic and financial time series when an explosive episode is both ongoing {{at the end of}} the sample, and of finite length. We propose a testing strategy based on the sub-sampling method of Andrews (2003), in which a suitable test statistic is calculated on a finite number of end-of-sample observations, with a critical value obtained using sub-sample test statistics calculated on the remaining observations. This approach also has the practical advantage that, by virtue of how the critical values are obtained, it can deliver tests which are robust to, among other things, conditional heteroskedasticity and serial correlation in the driving shocks. We also explore modifications of the raw statistics to account for unconditional heteroskedasticity using <b>studentisation</b> and a White-type correction. We evaluate the finite sample size and power properties of our proposed procedures, and find that they offer promising levels of power, suggesting the possibility for earlier detection of end-of-sample bubble episodes compared to existing procedures...|$|E
40|$|Recently {{there has}} been {{considerable}} work on stochastic time-varying coefficient models as vehicles for modelling structural change in the macroeconomy {{with a focus on}} the estimation of the unobserved sample path of time series of coefficient processes. The dominant estimation methods, in this context, are based on various filters, such as the Kalman filter, that are applicable when the models are cast in state space representations. This paper examines, in a rigorous manner, alternative kernel based estimation approaches for such models in a nonparametric framework and derives their basic properties. The use of such estimation methods for stochastic time-varying coefficient models, or any persistent stochastic process for that matter, is novel and has not been suggested previously in the literature. The proposed inference methods have desirable properties such as consistency and asymptotic normality and allow a tractable <b>studentisation.</b> In extensive Monte Carlo and empirical studies, we find that the methods exhibit very good small sample properties and can shed light on important empirical issues such as the evolution of inflation persistence and the PPP hypothesis.
