5|$|In a {{hearings}} {{before the}} United States Steamboat Inspection Service, Captain Knowles of El Sol {{and the captain}} of Sac City were both cleared of wrongdoing in the collision, and the blame was laid on the heavy fog. On 31 July, The New York Times reported on the cargo salvage operations still underway on the wreck of El Sol. In three months of continuous operations, the <b>salvage</b> <b>company</b> reported that about 35% of the sunken ship's cargo had been recovered. The hulk of El Sol was scrapped later in 1927.|$|E

5|$|The initial salvage {{attempts}} were unsuccessful and the Espingole was struck off the naval register on 16 September. The navy sold her wreck at auction in December 1909 {{and decided to}} offer an escalating series of bonuses if the winner could refloat the ship and deliver it intact. The <b>salvage</b> <b>company</b> was no more successful and abandoned the effort after five months of work. The company claimed that the navy had disturbed the wreck and sued for 60,000 francs plus damages. The dispute was not settled until 3 March 1926.|$|E
5|$|After {{the lodge}} was completed, {{it was decided}} to build a {{restaurant}} and breezeway onto the lodge building. Logs for most of the project were shipped via railroad {{from as far away as}} Oregon and Washington state, unloaded in Stratford, Illinois and dragged to the construction site by teams of horses. The CCC project also completed sixteen one-room log cabins and three four-bedroom cabins. The work crews also built picnic shelters, trail shelters, and foot bridges. Only the logs for the cabins came from another source. They were purchased from a <b>salvage</b> <b>company</b> that had purchased utility poles from a defunct utility company at the price of 30 cents a piece.|$|E
5|$|Extensive {{damage was}} found by the diver's {{preliminary}} examination of the ship, including tearing and inch-sized gaps in Astrids hull, as well as popped rivets and spread plates. The <b>salvage</b> <b>company</b> Blue Ocean, of Castletownbere, were appointed to recover the ship. The plans for the salvage operation consisted of removing around 3.5 tonnes of diesel fuel from the ship's fuel tanks, pumping {{water out of the}} ship and cutting away equipment including the rigging and masts, before a floating crane lifted the vessel from the rocks. The ship would then be taken to a nearby port to be handed over to the insurers. As of the end of July 2013 it was thought that the ship will never sail again, and that she would be written off as a total constructive loss. A month after sinking, Astrid was still under water.|$|E

5|$|Nautilus was {{transferred}} to the Baltic in 1916, and took part in Operation Albion in 1917, where she supported the conquest of the Gulf of Riga. In 1918, she was modified to support amphibious operations, with her 8.8cm guns replaced by a host of smaller weapons. She was assigned to the Sonderverband tasked with supporting the White Finns during the Finnish Civil War, though she did not see action. Instead, she spent the remainder of the war patrolling in the eastern Baltic. After the war ended in November 1918, Nautilus was demilitarized according to the terms of the Treaty of Versailles and hulked; she was renamed Hulk I and later Hulk A, eventually being scrapped in 1928. Albatross, meanwhile, had been refloated by a Swedish <b>salvage</b> <b>company</b> in July 1915 and interned {{for the rest of the}} war. She was returned in 1919, stricken from the naval register and scrapped that year.|$|E
5|$|Of the 74 German {{ships in}} Scapa Flow, 15 of the 16 capital ships, 5 of the 8 cruisers, and 32 of the 50 destroyers were sunk. The {{remainder}} either remained afloat, or were towed to shallower waters and beached. The beached ships were later dispersed to the allied navies, {{but most of}} the sunken ships were initially left at the bottom of Scapa Flow, the cost of salvaging them being deemed to be not worth the potential returns, owing to the glut of scrap metal left {{after the end of the}} war, with plenty of obsolete warships having been broken up. After complaints from locals that the wrecks were a hazard to navigation, a <b>salvage</b> <b>company</b> was formed in 1923, which raised four of the sunken destroyers.|$|E
5|$|Of the fatalities, 26 of the German sailors {{were buried}} the same evening {{the battle was}} fought in a mass grave just east of Östergarn Church. One crew had fallen {{overboard}} {{and could not be}} found. Two of the crew members who died during transportation to Roma were buried at Björke cemetery. The surviving German crew were interned, first in Roma, then at Blåhäll in Tofta. The Swedish <b>salvage</b> <b>company</b> Neptun refloated Albatross on 23 July and towed her to Fårösund before proceeding to Oskarshamn, where she was interned {{for the duration of the}} war. Sweden returned Albatross and her crew to Kiel in January 1919; there, she was formally decommissioned on 23 January. On 21 March, she was stricken from the naval register and thereafter sold for 900,000marks and broken up for scrap in Hamburg.|$|E

40|$|Identifying {{the name}} of a {{historic}} shipwreck is often a primary issue that a court needs to address when deciding salvage claims over the shipwreck. Based upon case studies and doctrinal analysis, this paper explores four key issues in the identification process: the imbalance of information between <b>salvage</b> <b>companies</b> and other interested parties; standard of proof for identification; no distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence; and misidentification and correction. This paper argues that the current U. S. federal civil (admiralty) procedure law has loopholes for misidentification of shipwrecks. This paper proposes that (1) although <b>salvage</b> <b>companies</b> may hesitate to release names of shipwrecks, other interested parties can use the heightened pleading rule and broad discovery to compel <b>salvage</b> <b>companies</b> to release information on the names of shipwrecks; (2) the clear and convincing evidence standard, instead of the preponderance of the evidence standard, should be applied to identify historic shipwrecks; (3) courts should ensure ongoing public disclosure of archaeology archives regarding identities of historic shipwrecks; and (4) courts may sua sponte retain maritime archaeologists to conduct peer review of evidence regarding identities of historic shipwrecks. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

5|$|Each {{division}} comprised three infantry brigades, {{and each}} brigade contained four battalions (later reduced to three in 1918). Australian battalions initially included eight rifle companies; however, this {{was reduced to}} four expanded companies in January 1915 to conform with the organisation of British infantry battalions. A battalion contained about 1,000 men. Although the divisional structure evolved {{over the course of}} the war, each formation also included a range of combat support and service units, including artillery, machine-gun, mortar, engineer, pioneer, signals, logistic, medical, veterinary and administrative units. By 1918 each brigade also included a light trench mortar battery, while each division included a pioneer battalion, a machine-gun battalion, two field artillery brigades, a divisional trench mortar brigade, four companies of engineers, a divisional signals company, a divisional train consisting of four service corps companies, a <b>salvage</b> <b>company,</b> three field ambulances, a sanitary section and a mobile veterinary section. These changes were reflective of wider organisational adaption, tactical innovation, and the adoption of new weapons and technology that occurred throughout the British Expeditionary Force (BEF).|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{remained}} in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Treaty of Versailles. Von Reuter {{believed that the}} British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. The ship sank in two hours and fifteen minutes. The task of raising Von der Tann was secured by Ernest Cox's <b>salvage</b> <b>company.</b> During preparation work, three workers were nearly killed when their oxy-acetylene cutters set off a major explosion. The blast tore holes in the still submerged vessel and allowed water into the compartment that had been emptied with compressed air; {{by the time the}} men were rescued, the compartment had refilled almost completely and the men were up to their necks. Nevertheless, the ship was successfully brought up on 7 December 1930, and scrapped at Rosyth by the Alloa Shipbreaking Company between 1931 and 1934.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{the attempt}} to recover the silver bars and copper coins in the 1750s, modern divers found the {{shipwreck}} off the Silva Shoal in the Mozambique Channel in 1986 and a <b>salvaging</b> <b>company</b> was called in by the South African Government to recover all the gold and silver ingots from the sea bed and transport them to Mozambique, operation which was started on 17 October 2003. Some of the relevant items salvaged are 15 iron cannons, 5 anchors, lead rolls and ingots, and some iron bars. A third part of the treasure was sent to South Africa after a long judicial battle which took {{more than four years}} and the part which corresponded to the <b>salvaging</b> <b>company</b> was sold at an auction at Christie's Amsterdam in that same year.|$|R
