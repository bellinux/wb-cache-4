5|$|In 2002, AC/DC {{signed a}} long-term, multi-album deal with Sony Music, {{who went on}} to release a series of remastered albums as part of their AC/DC remasters series. Each release {{contained}} an expanded booklet featuring rare photographs, memorabilia, and notes. In 2003, the entire back-catalogue (except Ballbreaker and <b>Stiff</b> Upper Lip) was remastered and re-released. Ballbreaker was eventually re-released in October 2005; <b>Stiff</b> Upper Lip was later re-released in April 2007. Also in 2003, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.|$|E

5000|$|As {{found by}} journalists such as Car and Driver in their September 1997 issue's {{comparison}} of [...] "Best Handling Car {{for more than}} $30K", the NSX, due to its mid-engine layout and rear-end link travel, was susceptible to a sudden oversteer condition during certain cornering maneuvers. While this condition rarely occurred during spirited street driving, {{it was much more}} prevalent on race tracks where speeds were much higher. To address the problem and improve the NSX-R's cornering stability at the limit, Honda added one aluminum bracket under the front battery tray and added one aluminum bracket in front of the front radiator to add more chassis rigidity then replaced the entire suspension with <b>stiffer</b> front sway bar, <b>stiffer</b> suspension bushings, <b>stiffer</b> coil springs and <b>stiffer</b> dampers.|$|R
5|$|In December 1863, Bramlette {{addressed}} the General Assembly, {{declaring that the}} state had fulfilled its quota of soldiers for the Union army.

30|$|Ng [13], Dufort [7], and Lu [14] {{among others}} found that cells, {{especially}} cancerous ones, show {{a preference for}} a <b>stiffer</b> ECM. Generally, cells will tend to migrate towards a <b>stiffer</b> ECM zone, a feature {{that is associated with}} wounds and tumors that are much <b>stiffer</b> than normal tissue. Studies have reported ECM elasticity changes {{as a function of the}} type of cells inhabiting the substrate. The elasticity of the cell can be changed depending on the substrate type [8, 15 – 18] which is exploited in experiments on the subject.|$|R

5000|$|The Accord SiR Coupe {{and then}} Accord SiR wagon were built with the Japan-spec H22A DOHC VTEC powertrains which were shipped from Japan and were {{installed}} into the HAM-built Accord SiR models. The 1994-1997 [...] "CD" [...] Accord chassis {{was designed for}} the H22A DOHC VTEC powertrain to be installed; because the firewall was curved at the top to allow more space for the tilting backwards of the H22A DOHC VTEC engine near {{the middle of the}} firewall. The H22A DOHC VTEC engine was the most powerful inline four-cylinder engine Honda built for the Prelude and the Accord before the 1995 U.S.-spec V6 sedan. The Accord SiR suspension was improved with <b>stiffer</b> front sway bar(27.2mmXt4.0 mm), <b>stiffer</b> rear sway bar (16 mm), <b>stiffer</b> front coil springs and <b>stiffer</b> rear coil springs.|$|R
50|$|<b>Stiffer</b> {{valve springs}} {{can help prevent}} valve float and valve bounce, but only {{at the expense of}} {{increased}} friction losses and higher stresses in the valvetrain.

5|$|According to the varying-permeability model, {{gas bubble}} nuclei are simply stable microbubbles. The {{stability}} of these microbubbles {{is due to}} elastic skins or membranes consisting of surface-active molecules. These skins are normally permeable to gas, and collapse is prevented by their compression strength. These skins can become <b>stiff</b> and effectively impermeable to gas when they are subjected to large compressions, typically exceeding 8atm, at which stage the pressure inside increases during further compression as predicted by Boyle's law.|$|E
5|$|Aerial {{courtship}} displays involve {{single and}} mutual high circling flight, {{and the male}} may fly around slowly with <b>stiff</b> exaggerated flaps, commonly known as butterfly-flight. Courting males dive at the female, feeding her in mid-flight. The female grabs food from the male's talons with hers while flipping upside-down. They may lock talons and tumble downwards in a ritualised version of grappling, but release just before landing. All courtship displays are accompanied by constant calling.|$|E
