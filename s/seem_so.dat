5|$|In 1597, King James wrote a {{dissertation}} on witchcraft titled Daemonologie {{in which he}} wrote the belief that demons could possess both {{the living and the}} dead. Within his classification of demons, he explained the concept through the notion that incubi and succubae could possess the corpse of the deceased and walk the earth. As a devil borrows a dead body, it would <b>seem</b> <b>so</b> visibly and naturally to any man who converses with them and that any substance within the body would remain intolerably cold to others which they abuse.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the reason}} people rarely talk about his {{formidable}} attributes as a singer is that he makes so little fuss about them. That celebrated ease of his has been too little understood. Ease in any art {{is the result of}} mastery over the details of the craft. You get them together {{to the point where you}} can forget about how you do things and concentrate on what you are doing. Como got them together so completely that the muscles don't even show. It seems effortless, but a good deal of effort has gone into making it <b>seem</b> <b>so.</b> Como is known to be meticulous about rehearsal of the material for an album. He tries things out in different keys, gives the song thought, makes suggestions, tries it again, and again, until he is satisfied. The hidden work makes him look like Mr. Casual, and too many people are taken in by it — but happily so.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Murbella {{is trying}} to prevent civil war on Chapterhouse, the only known source of melange left in the universe. She meets an {{emissary}} sent by the Spacing Guild, which is desperate for spice. Murbella refuses their requests due to the help the Guild gave to the Honored Matres, and demands the Guild's future loyalty, threatening to cut them off completely. Unbeknownst to the Guild delegation {{and the rest of}} the universe, the sandworms on Chapterhouse are not yet producing much melange; the Bene Gesserit are making it <b>seem</b> <b>so,</b> using their own stockpiles. Later, Murbella stops a brutal fight between some polarized Bene Gesserits and Honored Matres.|$|E

25|$|A {{few weeks}} later, Tebbit gave an {{interview}} to John Mortimer for The Spectator where he said of Thatcher: It's a question of her leadership when our aims aren't clearly defined. When people understand what she's doing there's {{a good deal of}} admiration for her energy and resolution and persistence, even from those people who don't agree with her. Now there's a perception that we don't know where we're going so those same qualities don't <b>seem</b> <b>so</b> attractive. Thatcher disagreed and her biographer claims she was suspicious of Tebbit's motives. Furthermore, Thatcher commissioned the firm Young and Rubicam to carry out their own polling, which concluded that Thatcher's leadership was not the problem. Throughout the rest of 1986 and into the 1987 election, Thatcher continued to use Young and Rubicam, which eventually caused tensions with Tebbit during the election campaign.|$|E
25|$|Modern logicists (like Bob Hale, Crispin Wright, {{and perhaps}} others) have {{returned}} to a program closer to Frege's. They have abandoned Basic Law V in favor of abstraction principles such as Hume's principle (the number of objects falling under the concept F equals the number of objects falling under the concept G {{if and only if}} the extension of F and the extension of G can be put into one-to-one correspondence). Frege required Basic Law V {{to be able to give}} an explicit definition of the numbers, but all the properties of numbers can be derived from Hume's principle. This would not have been enough for Frege because (to paraphrase him) it does not exclude the possibility that the number 3 is in fact Julius Caesar. In addition, many of the weakened principles that they have had to adopt to replace Basic Law V no longer <b>seem</b> <b>so</b> obviously analytic, and thus purely logical.|$|E

500|$|Charles Rosen, who unraveled {{this unique}} {{borrowing}} of a Beethovenian structure in Schubert's A major Sonata, has {{also referred to}} Schubert's departure from the former's style in this instance: [...] "Schubert moves with great ease within the form which Beethoven created. He has, however, considerably loosened what held it together, and stretched its ligaments unmercifully... the correspondence of part to whole has been considerably altered by Schubert, and explains why his large movements often <b>seem</b> <b>so</b> long, since they are being produced with forms originally intended for shorter pieces. Some of the excitement naturally goes out of these forms when they are so extended, but this is even a condition of the unforced melodic flow of Schubert's music". Rosen adds, however, that [...] "with the finale of the A major Sonata Schubert produced a work that is unquestionably greater than its model".|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{positively}} {{reviewed by the}} contemporary trade publications that garnered almost universal acclaim.

[...] The New York Dramatic Mirror praised the production and commented on the clear adaptation of Shakespeare's work, resulting in an unusually clear presentation of the story. Another review in The Moving Picture World praised the film in a follow-up to the first review, commenting on the ephemeral nature of the productions by saying [...] "Few, indeed, will be the releases of the month to surpass this, and few, indeed, are the pictures that <b>seem</b> <b>so</b> complete and in every way satisfactory." ...|$|E

500|$|Nirvana's {{surprise}} {{success with}} Nevermind heralded a [...] "new openness to alternative rock" [...] among commercial radio stations, opening doors for heavier alternative bands in particular. In {{the wake of}} Nevermind, alternative rock [...] "found itself dragged-kicking and screaming... into the mainstream" [...] and record companies, confused by the genre's success yet eager to capitalize on it, scrambled to sign bands. The New York Times declared in 1993, [...] "Alternative rock doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>so</b> alternative anymore. Every major label has a handful of guitar-driven bands in shapeless shirts and threadbare jeans, bands with bad posture and good riffs who cultivate the oblique and the evasive, who conceal catchy tunes with noise and hide craftsmanship behind nonchalance." [...] However, many alternative rock artists rejected success, for it conflicted with the rebellious, DIY ethic the genre had espoused before mainstream exposure and their ideas of artistic authenticity.|$|E
500|$|Despite Rafter's book, London society {{remained}} largely unaware of MacGregor's failures {{over the past}} few years, but remembered successes such as his march to Barcelona; similarly his association with the [...] "Die-Hards" [...] of the 57th Foot was recalled, but his dubious early discharge was not. In this climate of a constantly shifting Latin America, where governments rose, fell, and adopted new names from year to year, it did not <b>seem</b> <b>so</b> implausible {{that there might be a}} country called Poyais or that a decorated general like MacGregor might be its leader. The Cazique became [...] "a great adornment for the dinner tables and ballrooms of sophisticated London", Sinclair writes—rumours abounded that he was partially descended from indigenous royalty. His exotic appeal was enhanced by the arrival of the striking [...] "Princess of Poyais", Josefa, who had given birth to a girl named Josefa Anna Gregoria at MacGregor's sister's home in Ireland. The MacGregors received countless social invitations, including an official reception at Guildhall from the Lord Mayor of London.|$|E

[...] Baradwaj Rangan, writing for The Hindu, said, [...] "Listen to the lazy drawl with which certain words taper off in ‘Avalukkenna,’ an antidote to the rock ‘n’ roll bounce {{in the rest of the}} song." [...] Poga Poga Theriyum" [...] was later included in Old is Gold, an album compiling hit songs from films featuring Muthuraman, and was rated by The Times of India as one of the album's [...] "hot picks".|$|E

[...] She believed that its simplicity turned out to be [...] "impactful, touching and uniting". Garon Cockrell from The Pratt Tribune gave the video a positive review, calling it [...] "excellent".

[...] PC Zone complained that certain gameplay mechanics had become outdated, but that [...] "the only real downer is the antiquated spell system and the inexplicable necessity to rest after every fight." [...] The game was also praised for its implementation of the Third Edition rules and interface. Computer Gaming World said that [...] "IWD II has the Third Edition rules down, and in no other place in the game is it more apparent than with character development," [...] and PC Gamer said it had [...] "a dazzling implementation of the D 3rd Edition rules."

500|$|... "Ave Maria" [...] is a ballad {{that runs}} for 3 minutes and 42 seconds. The Village Voices Nana Ekua Brew-Hammond {{described}} the song as being [...] "opera-tinted". According to the sheet music published by EMI Music Publishing, {{it is written}} in the key of C Major with a slow tempo of 75 beats per minute and it is set in common time. The song samples Franz Schubert's [...] "Ave Maria", however as noted by Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly, even though it [...] "does riff on the classic aria, it's not an actual cover". The main instruments in [...] "Ave Maria" [...] include a piano and strings. Throughout the song, Knowles' voice shows restraint as she sings in a lower register with an operatic soprano that gives her more vocal power, as commented by Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News. Her vocal range spans from the music note of B3 to E5. Lyrically, [...] "Ave Maria" [...] is about being surrounded by friends but still feeling alone, as conveyed by the lines, [...] "How can the silence <b>seem</b> <b>so</b> loud?" [...] and [...] "There's only us when the lights go down". This view was echoed by Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle, who wrote that the song weaves [...] "a vivid tale of a desperate woman".|$|E
