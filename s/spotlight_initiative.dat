40|$|Busca-se aqui {{discutir}} os desafios que se antepõem à tarefa da construção do sistema {{nacional de}} educação, no contexto do Plano de Desenvolvimento da Educação, tema retomado por iniciativa do Ministério da Educação. Com base nas imprecisões e confusões reinantes nessa área, começa-se pela discussão do próprio significado da expressão 'sistema nacional' a partir de sua configuração histórica. Em seguida, aborda-se o tema propriamente dito, ou seja, os desafios para a construção do sistema, os quais são agrupados em quatro modalidades: econômicos, traduzidos na tradicional e persistente resistência à manutenção do ensino público no Brasil; políticos, expressos na descontinuidade das iniciativas de reforma da educação; ideológicos, representados pelas idéias e interesses contrários ao sistema nacional de educação; e legais, correspondentes à resistência à aprovação de uma legislação que viabilize a organização do ensino na forma de um sistema nacional em nosso país. The {{purpose of the}} article is to discuss the challenges that are faced in the task of building the national education system {{in the context of}} the Plan for the Development of Education, an issue that has come back under the <b>spotlight</b> by <b>initiative</b> of the Ministry of Education. Based on the inaccuracies and confusion that prevail in this area, the discussion begins with the meaning of the expression 'national system' itself, as based on its historical configuration. It then approaches the theme, i. e., the hurdles that must be overcome to build the system, which are grouped in four modes: economics, translated in the traditional and persistent resistance to maintaining public education in Brazil; political, expressed by the lack of continuity in educational reform initiatives; ideological, represented by ideas and interests that are contrary to the national education system; and legal, involving the resistance against the approval of legislation that may make organizing education as a national system in our country viable...|$|R

5000|$|The {{achievements}} {{and impact of}} ID2015 are discussed in Irish Design 2015 - Making Design Matter a book that offers a comprehensive examination of the year of Irish design. Through a series of essays by key participants in the <b>initiative,</b> <b>spotlight</b> reports on the different projects mounted throughout the year, and group discussions featuring leading Irish and international figures from the sector, Making Design Matter captures the why and the how of the landmark initiative that was Irish Design 2015 (ID2015). Edited by Professor Alex Milton, ID2015 Programme Director; Karen Hennessy, CEO of ID2015 [...] and DCCoI and Rachel Donnelly, ID2015 Content Editor, the publication takes a broad view of the design sector in Ireland, reflecting on key moments in its past, engaging with its vibrant present, and speculating about its optimistic future. The publication also presents a comprehensive quantitative analysis {{of the impact of}} the year's activities, alongside statistics representing the economic footprint of the design sector in Ireland. ID2015 was pioneering in its target-focused approach to making design matter, with the result that this is the first ever quantitative analysis of the impact of design activity mounted on this scale.|$|R
40|$|Editor's Note: When {{started this}} project to <b>spotlight</b> the pay-ment-for-performance <b>initiative,</b> which {{will go into}} effect in stages {{beginning}} in 2007, was confident that {{would be able to}} get someone from Medicare or even an aide from a congressman or senator who authored this bill to write an editorial supporting the program. But, alas, there were no takers. Therefore, it became my responsibility to write this piece as the editor in chief. actually have mixed emotions about this bill, because have long been concerned about the lack of attention by our medical schools to patient safe-ty issues, and have written about this in other venues. How-ever, am concerned about the impact of this bill on all physicians who work in solo or small group practices and especially those in hard-core urban centers and rural prac-tices where the cost of technology is formidably prohibitive. Although part of HR 747 includes a mechanism for them to secure funding to improve their informatics technology capabilities, there will surely be problems with them doing so in a timely and efficient manner. Lest anyone have any doubts about this, they need only look back at the absolute disaster in the dissipation of federal aid to Hurrcane Katrina victims along the Gulf Coast.

40|$|Increasing life {{expectancy}} in the UK {{is one of}} the greatest changes to affect our society in the last 200 years. Over 65 s in Britain now outnumber those under 16, with over 85 s the fastest growing part of the population. Currently {{life expectancy}} is increasing by two or more years each decade, or five hours for every day you live, with no sign of slowing down. The average life expectancy for a child born now is 80. This exhibition draws together a range of historic and contemporary artworks showing the many different ways artists have examined the effects, the wisdom and the achievements of ageing. It explores the phenomenon of increased longevity and celebrates the triumphs and vitality of older age. The exhibition is part of a year-long programme of events organised by Newcastle University to launch the ‘Changing Age’ <b>initiative,</b> <b>spotlighting</b> the challenges facing society as we live longer. During 2010, three artists, Andrew Carnie, Annie Cattrell and Jennie Pedley, observed the work of scientists within the University’s Institute for Ageing and Health, one of the world’s leading research centres in this area. The artists responded to this ground-breaking research into the ageing process by producing a new body of specially commissioned artworks.

40|$|It is not {{uncommon}} for state university faculty to participate as part-time consultants in the administration of state Medicaid programs. However, rarely do state universities participate institutionally as public agencies in the administration of state Medicaid programs since the propriety, value and parameters of these engagements are usually not recognized. Even in states where they flourish, collaborations between state universities and state Medicaid agencies are not well understood and suggest to some people an unlikely confluence of two worlds. The missions of state universities and state Medicaid programs differ, their institutional cultures differ, and their protocols differ. In all states, state universities are considered apart from other state agencies, sometimes to the point of not being thought of as state agencies at all. Yet, the appropriateness and benefits of state universities engaging in Medicaid administration have been well established by state universities and the state Medicaid programs that have worked together. In light of the challenges facing state Medicaid programs and what state universities can do for these programs, state universities contributing to Medicaid administration should be more recognized and more common. Explanation and examples follow. Rounding out this discussion will be depictions of collaborations in three states: Maryland, Massachusetts and Ohio. Maryland’s <b>initiative</b> <b>spotlights</b> analytic, program development and program evaluation services; Massachusetts’ features clinical expertise; and, Ohio’s dwells on workforce development. In all three states, the state university partner does far more for Medicaid than is covered here, but these examples suggest the breadth of what state universities can do...|$|R
