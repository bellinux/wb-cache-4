25|$|Because {{hardened}} metal {{is usually}} more brittle than softer metal, through-hardening (that is, hardening the metal uniformly throughout the piece) {{is not always}} a suitable choice for uses where the metal part is subject to <b>sliding</b> <b>contact</b> with hard or abrasive materials. In such circumstances, case-hardening can provide a part that will not fracture (because of the soft core that can absorb stresses without cracking) but also provides adequate wear resistance on the surface.|$|E

The formation of oxides on stainless steels, for example, can provide a protective layer preventing further atmospheric attack, allowing for a material to be used for sustained periods at both room and high temperatures in hostile conditions. Such high-temperature corrosion products, in the form of compacted oxide layer glazes, prevent or reduce wear during high-temperature <b>sliding</b> <b>contact</b> of metallic (or metallic and ceramic) surfaces.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe study numerically the {{propagation}} of an acoustic pulse through a loaded granular material under {{the hypothesis that the}} conventional modeling of solid friction used in soft sphere discrete element mod-eling remains valid at acoustic time scales. As a pulse crosses the material, it temporarily suppresses <b>sliding</b> <b>contacts,</b> making it difficult to prepare states that correspond to experimental conditions. The pulse speed is strongly affected by the loading in a very anisotropic way, varying by as much as a factor of two depending on {{the propagation}} direction. We separate the contribution of the contact network from that of <b>sliding</b> <b>contacts,</b> and show that <b>sliding</b> <b>contacts</b> can reduce the propagation speed as much as changes in coordination number. <b>Sliding</b> <b>contacts</b> have a characteristic acoustic signature: pulse speed depends on sign (compression or rarefaction), even at very small amplitudes...|$|R

30|$|Textured {{surfaces}} {{are widely used}} in engineering components as they can improve tribological properties of <b>sliding</b> <b>contacts,</b> while the detailed behaviors of nanoscale reciprocating <b>sliding</b> <b>contacts</b> of textured {{surfaces are}} still lack of study. By using multiscale method, two dimensional nanoscale reciprocating <b>sliding</b> <b>contacts</b> of textured surfaces are investigated. The influence of indentation depth, texture shape, texture spacing, and tip radius on the average friction forces and the running-in stages is studied. The {{results show that the}} lowest indentation depth can make all the four textured surfaces reach steady state. Surfaces with right-angled trapezoid textures on the right side are better for reducing the running-in stage, and surfaces with right-angled trapezoid textures on the left side are better to reduce wear. Compared with other textured surfaces, the total average friction forces can be reduced by 82.94 %– 91.49 % for the case of the contact between the tip with radius R[*]=[*] 60 r 0 and the isosceles trapezoid textured surface. Besides, the total average friction forces increase with the tip radii due to that bigger tip will induce higher contact areas. This research proposes a detailed study on nanoscale reciprocating <b>sliding</b> <b>contacts</b> of textured surfaces, to contribute to design textured surfaces, reduce friction and wear.|$|R

40|$|Experimental studies {{presented}} in this paper indicate that stationary and <b>sliding</b> <b>contacts</b> of practical applications may exhibit non-linear behaviour.

The physical phenomena which appear in this case seem to be dependent on the degradation of the contacts and the increase in thickness of the overlayers. The conductivity through thin interfacial layers (< 50 angstrom) is attributed to quantum mechanical tunneling and through thicker interfacial layers to field emission and impact ionisation. The well-established metal-insulator-metal theory provides the required theoretical basis for the interpretation of the measurements.

40|$|Static {{packings}} {{of perfectly}} rigid particles are investigated theoretically and numerically. The problem {{of finding the}} contact forces in such packings is formulated mathematically. Letting {{the values of the}} contact forces define a vector in a high-dimensional space enable us to show that the set of all possible contact forces is convex, facilitating its numerical exploration. It is also found that the boundary of the set is connected with the presence of <b>sliding</b> <b>contacts,</b> suggesting that a stable packing should not have more than 2 M- 3 N <b>sliding</b> <b>contacts</b> in two dimensions, where M is the number of contacts and N is the number of particles. These results were used to analyze packings generated in different ways by either molecular dynamics or contact dynamics simulations. The dimension of the set of possible forces and the number of <b>sliding</b> <b>contacts</b> agrees with the theoretical expectations. The indeterminacy of each component of the contact forces are found, as well as the an estimate for the diameter of the set of possible contact forces. We also show that contacts with high indeterminacy are located on force chains. The question of whether the simulation methods can represent a packing's memory of its formation is addressed.

50|$|Coilguns {{generally}} {{consist of}} one or more coils arranged along a barrel, so the path of the accelerating projectile lies along the central axis of the coils.

In addition, railguns usually require the use of <b>sliding</b> <b>contacts</b> to pass a large current through the projectile or sabot but coilguns do not necessarily require <b>sliding</b> <b>contacts.</b> While some simple coilgun concepts can use ferromagnetic projectiles or even permanent magnet projectiles, most designs for high velocities actually incorporate a coupled coil as part of the projectile.|$|R
