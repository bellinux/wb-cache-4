40|$|Researchers {{performed}} {{laboratory experiments}} on soil-fabric-aggregate systems {{to evaluate the}} effect of a geotextile on unpaved road performance. Direct shear tests performed on gravel indicated a 42 -degree friction angle. Similar tests performed on soil-fabric-aggregate systems resulted in an interface friction value for the nonwoven geotextile system {{similar to that of the}} gravel alone. The <b>slit</b> <b>film</b> and heavy weight woven systems generated friction angles about 20 percent lower. Observations of model tests showed that in terms of rut depths, the nonwoven performed better than the <b>slit</b> <b>film</b> woven geotextile for all gravel thickness', most likely because of the nonwoven's higher frictional characteristics. The rut diameters for the <b>slit</b> <b>film</b> and nonwoven reinforced systems tended to be larger than those observed for the unreinforced systems indicating an increased load-spread angle through the gravel. Based on rutting alone, the unreinforced model with 200 mm (8 in.) gravel was equivalent to that of the <b>slit</b> <b>film</b> in reinforced model with 150 mm (6 in.) gravel and the nonwoven model with 100 mm (4 in.) gravel. A so-called bearing capacity factor for the unreinforced models was approximately 50 percent less than the nonwoven reinforced models, in reasonable agreement with theory.

40|$|Field {{experiments}} were undertaken {{to determine the}} effect of oxodegradable thin film on cotton establishment and lint yield. It was hypothesised that the use of thin oxodegradable plastic film would increase soil temperature and conserve seedbed water possibly reducing the risk in early planting, while not reducing lint yield or fibre quality of cotton. Experiments were conducted near Narrabri, NSW Australia during the 2010, 2012 - 2014 and the 2012 and 2013 seasons near Griffith, a cooler region in southern NSW with three or four thin oxodegradable plastic films with different formulations and break down rates being compared with a bare soil treatment. Planting depth soil temperature and soil water potential was monitored at three hourly intervals. Soil temperatures were elevated by 2 - 4. °C under the film compared with the bare soil that resulted in earlier (2 - 4 days) emergence of cotton under the film compared with bare soil. Soil also remained wetter beneath the film. Two films began to degrade at the time when cotton seedlings emerged (10 - 20 days), resulting in greater seedling survival (2 - 7 vs 12. plants/m). Seedlings were unable to penetrate four films on emergence and did not survive. When these films were slit to allow seedling growth, survival depended on subsequent environmental conditions; whether overcast/sunny or cool/warm conditions occurred. Using film that had been slotted prior to being laid in the field also increased soil temperature and conserved seedbed water. This enhanced (50 - 80 %) emergence and survival of emerged seedlings, and overcame the need to <b>slit</b> <b>film</b> in the field. A climate analysis and simulation study was also conducted to determine the benefit or otherwise of thin film and early planting over a longer-term than is possible from field studies. Results for both sites indicated that the earlier the planting date (August/September), compared to a "normal" planting date (October) there was a greater the chance of cold (6. 5 vs 2. 5 days) and frost (2. 5 vs 0 days) being experienced, which resulted in lower or no lint yield. Lint yield tended to be greater (3200 vs 2800. kg. lint/ha), although not significantly so, with thin film compared with bare soil. Fibre quality parameters were not affected by the use of thin film. All surface film had degraded {{by the end of the}} season posing no risk of contamination of the lint. Film below ground did remained intact, but this does not pose a contamination risk for the cotton lint at harvest. No plastic film was detected in ginned cotton after being machine harvested at both sites. There was no significant benefit in lint yield due to thin film, while all fibre quality parameters made base grade. Long-term simulation of early planting, with and without thin film, indicated that lint yield was variable with no consistent benefit due to the presence of thin film for the locations simulated. There is still a risk of cold weather or frost occurring when planting early with thin film that growers need to consider. In practical terms it is anticipated that growers would potentially only plant 5 % of their area early depending on the seasonal forecast...|$|E

5000|$|Birt Acres was {{the first}} to attempt an amateur format, {{creating}} Birtac in 1898 by <b>slitting</b> the <b>film</b> into 17.5 mm widths. By the early 1920s, several formats had successfully split the amateur home movies market away from 35 mm: 28 mm (1.1 in) (1912), 9.5 mm (0.37 in) (1922), 16 mm (0.63 in) (1923), and Pathe Rural, a 17.5 mm format designed for safety film (1926). Eastman Kodak's 16 mm format won the amateur market and is still widely in use today, mainly in the Super 16 variation, which remains popular with professional filmmakers. The 16 mm size was specifically chosen to prevent third-party slitting, as it was easy to create 17.5 mm stock from slitting 35 mm stock in two. It also {{was the first}} major format to be released with only fireproof cellulose diacetate (and later cellulose triacetate) [...] "safety film" [...] base. This amateur market would be further diversified by the introduction of 8 mm film (0.31 in) in 1932, intended for amateur filmmaking and [...] "home movies". By law, 16 mm and 8 mm gauge stock (and 35 mm films intended for non-theatrical use) had to be manufactured on safety stock. The effect of these gauges was to essentially make the 35 mm gauge almost the exclusive province of professional filmmakers, a divide which mostly remains to this day.|$|R

A dual curtain FP shutter {{does not have}} precut slits and the spring tension is not adjustable. The exposure slit is formed by drawing open the first curtain onto one drum and then pulling closed the second curtain off a second drum after a clockwork escapement timed delay (imagine two overlapping window shades) and moves at one speed (technically the curtains are still accelerating slightly) across film gate. Faster shutter speeds are provided by timing the second shutter curtain to close sooner after the first curtain opens and narrowing the <b>slit</b> wiping the <b>film</b> (see schematic figures above). Dual curtain FP shutters are self-capping; the curtains are designed to overlap as the shutter is cocked to prevent double exposure.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} analysis of the optical properties of one-dimensional arrays of <b>slits</b> in metal <b>films.</b> Although enhanced transmission windows are dominated by Fabry-Perot cavity modes localized inside the slits, the periodicity introduces surface modes that can either enhance or inhibit light transmission. We thus illustrate the interaction between cavity modes and surface modes in both finite and infinite arrays of slits. In particular we study a grating that clearly separates surface plasmon effects from Wood-Rayleigh anomalies. The periodicity of the grating induces a strong plasmonic band gap that inhibits coupling to the cavity modes for frequencies {{near the center of the}} band gap, thereby reducing the transmission of the grating. Strong field localization at the high energy plasmonic band edge enhances coupling to the cavity modes while field localization at the low energy band edge leads to weak cavity coupling and reduced transmission...|$|R

We demonstrate that the SPP generated on the second slab depends on the frequency but not on the wave vector of the collapsed SPP; a SPP is transmitted even when the two metals forming the slit are different.

40|$|The {{lipid layer}} {{plays a major}} role in {{limiting}} evaporation of the tear film. Based on interference phenomena, there is a test directed to lipid layer pattern (LLP) evaluation, but is affected by subjective interpretation of the patterns. The aim of this study is to compare the LLP evaluation between two experienced observers on a group of healthy patients. Furthermore, the observers re-evaluated the same images in order to check their individual repeatability. LLP was examined using a Tearscope-plus (Keeler, Windsor, UK) attached to a <b>slit</b> lamp. Tear <b>film</b> was ecorded by a Topcon DV- 3 digital camera video and LLP images were captured. This yielded 124 LLP images that were categorized (based on Guillon’s schema) by two expert observers in two sessions separated by one month. Interobserver repeatability and intraobserver repeatability between both sessions were studied by using Cohen’s kappa coefficient. Comparing LLP categorization between both observers, Cohen's kappa coefficient was 0. 615 and 0. 633 for first and second session, respectively. When comparing LLP categorization by the same observer between both sessions, Cohen's kappa coefficient was 0. 770 and 0. 812 for Observer 1 and Observer 2. These results indicate substantial correlation in all cases [range of 0. 61 – 0. 80]. The most frequent misinterpretations were between open and closed meshwork and Wave and closed meshwork patterns. Although substantial correlation was found between categorizations of experienced observers, misinterpretation of the patters may appear even in the same observer. Some misinterpretations between adjacent patterns could be palliated by including intermediate patterns between those categories.
