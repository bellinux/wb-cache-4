40|$|The {{well-established}} semi-analytic {{finite element}} (SAFE) method for predicting guided wave propagation in <b>straight</b> <b>guides</b> is extended {{to deal with}} curved pipes using curvilinear coordinates system, following developments by Treyssède and Laguerre [J. Sound Vib. 329 1702 - 16 (2010) ] for helical wires. The modal solution in the elbow can be obtained and the bi-orthogonality relation known for <b>straight</b> <b>guides</b> still holds. The influence of elbow curvature is exemplified by a short parametrical study. The scattering at the junction between a <b>straight</b> <b>guide</b> and an elbow sharing a common section is then considered. Assuming the modal solutions in the straight part and in the curved one are known, the mode-matching method is specifically derived to compute the scattering matrix which deals with waves arising from one part or the other, that is to say, to predict reflection and transmission coefficients at such a junction. Interestingly, the overall formulation requires a single mesh of the section to compute both the modal solutions and the scattering. The scattering matrix computation makes it necessary {{to take into account}} evanescent modes locally at the junction of both parts. Again, few examples of numerical results are shown to illustrate specific phenomena arising in this complex scattering case...|$|R

Physical examination revealed bradycardia, {{the rest was}} uneventful. Electrocardiogram showed Mobitz II atrioventricular block. Patient was scheduled for permanent pacemaker implantation. Subclavian vein access was performed via direct puncture. The guide wire was advanced, entered the subclavian vein and descended parallel to the spine without crossing over to the right side. Subsequently, the guide wire traversed the coronary sinus and ended in the right atrium. Persistent left superior vena cava was diagnosed.

There is however limited understanding of how losses scale with bend radii. A detailed analysis is performed using two-dimensional finite difference time domain simulations for straight waveguides interconnected by 180 ° micro-bends. Modal overlap optimization at each straight-waveguide to micro-bend junction is successfully performed to give low losses for radii above 20 µm. However, at reduced radii, simply optimizing the lateral offset between waveguides is insufficient for fabrication tolerance and losses are critically defined by the mode-matching between <b>straight</b> <b>guides</b> and micro-bend structures...|$|R
