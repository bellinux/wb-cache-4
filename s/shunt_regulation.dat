Thus, honeycomb composite panels, triple junction solar cells and serie or <b>shunt</b> <b>regulation</b> system can now be taken into account. After a brief summary of the methodology, the improvements are detailed. Finally, some encouraging frequency and time-domain results of magnetic field emitted by a real solar panel are presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{performance}} of prototype single-sided modules with ABCN- 25 front-end chips and 10 x 10 cm 2 Hamamatsu silicon strip sensors is presented. A low mass module assembly has been achieved by gluing a single-sided flex circuit, with read out chips, directly onto the sensor. The design exploits the embedded <b>shunt</b> <b>regulation</b> within the ABCN- 25 providing for a distributed and scalable powered architecture. This allows for multiple modules to be linked together serially to form larger stave structures of up to 12 modules. The stave's digital I/O is realised as a multi-drop LVDS bus flex cable glued to the stave core assembly using a custom receiver/transmitter ASIC (BCC). The results of preliminary electrical tests with 4 module stavelets will be presente...|$|E
40|$|Outer planet {{spacecraft}} have unique {{requirements that}} differentiate them from inner planet and Earth orbiter spacecraft. To meet these requirements, the Voyager and Galileo Power Management And Distribution (PMAD) architectures employed <b>shunt</b> <b>regulation</b> and {{carried on the}} Mariner tradition of AC power distribution {{to many of the}} user loads. Also, autonomous fault recovery was achieved by automatic responses in hardware and software recovery routines. Finally, power distribution switching was expanded to allow for removal of the most trivial load element as the nuclear source depleted itself. The design cycle has begun for a third generation spacecraft set named Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini (a saturn orbiter). In their power systems, AC power distribution, relay/fuse load switching, and fault protection will give way to the advantages of DC power and solid state load switches...|$|E
40|$|The {{proposed}} Jupiter Icy Moon Orbiter, JIMO, mission {{selected a}} Brayton power conversion system as its electrical power generator. Although the JIMO mission power conversion system {{was expected to}} produce {{in the order of}} 100 kW, an available 2 kW Brayton system was used to develop control system strategies for the JIMO mission. This report describes the <b>shunt</b> loading voltage/speed <b>regulation</b> control concept developed for the 2 kW system, and the transient performance of controls. The 2 kW alternator is a permanent magnet alternator as proposed for the JIMO mission, and operates at a similar speed and internal impedance, allowing it to be used as an accurate model for performance of the larger system. The JIMO mission was cancelled in September 2005...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of the Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) on {{alleviation}} of voltage stability problem from a viewpoint of time domain simulations achieved by using in-house developed computer program. The control system of the UPFC's injection model is developed to fulfil functions of reactive <b>shunt</b> compensation, voltage <b>regulation,</b> line power flow regulation, series compensation and phase shifting meeting multiple control objectives by applying boosting transformer injected voltage and exciting transformer reactive current. In addition to these types of regulation, the block for damping of electromechanical oscillations based on transient energy function (TEF) is also implemented in the model. The benefits of the UPFC's contribution to avoiding of voltage collapse are explored by analysing a simple two machine test system retaining versatile regulating and damping capabilities of the controller...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} whether chronic hypoxemia secondary to an intracardiac right-to-left <b>shunt</b> alters <b>regulation</b> of the myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor/adenylate cyclase system, we produced chronic hypoxemia in nine newborn lambs by creating right ventricular outflow obstruction and an atrial septal defect. Oxygen saturation {{was reduced to}} 65 - 74 % for 2 wk. Eight lambs served as normoxemic controls. beta-receptor density (Bmax) and ligand affinity (KD) were determined with the radio-ligand [125 I]iodocyanopindolol and adenylate cyclase activity determined during stimulation with isoproterenol, sodium fluoride (NaF), and forskolin. During chronic hypoxemia, Bmax decreased 45 % (hypoxemic, 180. 6 +/- 31. 5 vs. control, 330. 5 +/- 60. 1 fmol/mg) in the left ventricle (exposed to hypoxemia alone) but was unchanged in the right ventricle (exposed to hypoxemia and pressure overload). KD was not different from control in either ventricle. Left ventricular isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was decreased by 39 % (30. 0 +/- 4. 3 % increase vs. 44. 1 +/- 9. 5 % increase) whereas right ventricular adenylate cyclase activity was unchanged. Stimulation of adenylate cyclase with NaF or forskolin was not different from control in either ventricle. Circulating epinephrine was increased fourfold whereas circulating and myocardial norepinephrine were unchanged. These data demonstrate a down-regulation of the left ventricular beta-adrenergic receptor/adenylate cyclase system during chronic hypoxemia secondary to an intracardiac right-to-left shunt...|$|R
40|$|The Applications Technology Satellite- 6 has {{performed}} more than 20 communications, technological and scientific experiments in 2 years of highly successful operation. Contributing substantially to this {{success has been}} {{the flexibility of the}} power system that allows multiple operation of experiments. The power system, a shunt-boost configuration, uses partial <b>shunt</b> <b>regulation</b> of the solar array and a boost regulator for control of battery power. Regulation is provided for three different operating modes: shunt, charge, and boost. This configuration achieves the highest efficiency of power transfer from the solar array to the loads. The solar array degradation (18. 5 percent) has been less than the predicted 20 percent in spite of extreme cycling from - 160 C to 60 C. A unique battery cycling regime of discharges varying from 5 percent to 60 percent daily is being encountered. During the second year, noneclipse discharges have occurred twice a day to depths of 35 percent and 45 percent. Battery performance has been good with only a small decrease in end-of-discharge voltage...|$|E
40|$|The Applications Technology Satellite- 6 power system, a shunt-boost configuration, uses partial <b>shunt</b> <b>regulation</b> of {{the solar}} array and a boost {{regulator}} for control of battery power. Regulation is provided for three different operating modes: shunt, charge, and boost. This configuration achieves the highest efficiency of power transfer from the solar array to the loads. The excellent dynamic regulation and low output impedance of the power system virtually eliminated the problem of subsystem interactions on the power bus due to conducted interference from load current fluctuations. The performance of the power system continues to be excellent. The solar array degradation (18. 5 percent) was less than the specified 20 percent in two years in spite of extreme cycling from - 160 C to 60 C. A unique battery cycling regime of discharges varying from 5 percent to 60 percent daily is being encountered. During the second year, noneclipse discharges have occurred twice a day to depths of 35 percent and 45 percent. Battery performance was good with only a small decrease in end-of-discharge voltage. A recent test to evaluate capacity gave 12. 4 AH (83 % of the nominal capacity of 15 AH) after over 1400 battery discharge cycles. A small increase in the end-of-charge voltage has recently occurred necessitating {{a change in the}} charge regime to achieve full charge conditions...|$|E
40|$|The current {{state-of-the-art}} {{power saving}} designs progressively evolve, boosted by the notable advancements in microelectronics technologies. However, due to scaling in {{size of the}} electrodes in the modern biomedical implants, high-voltage power supplies (some 5 - 20 V) are necessitated for electrodes actuation purposes while most the implantable electronic sub-systems are operating under low-voltage power supplies (3 V) generated by linear regulators with degenerated power efficiency. Therefore, on system point of view, modern techniques on power saving fall far behind the system level requirements and will have reliability issues in the specific applications such as biomedical implants. The major challenge in our research presented in this thesis is the design of linear power supplies with current recycling capabilities and is required to cope with high-voltage stimulus power supply. For an implantable device, the linear power supply circuit is characterised to have low power dissipation, small real-estate and reliable as well as stable operation under wide range of power supply voltages. In this thesis, we propose a current recycling technique in linear regulators for biomedical implants. The unique technology allows linear regulators being stacked, dividing the high-voltage power supply domain into several low-voltage supply domains; current can be recycled between these power supplies by having a current recycling node and power efficiency in the low-voltage powered circuits can be enhanced. Linear regulators are designed such that they both have series and <b>shunt</b> <b>regulation</b> capabilities. A dual-stacked current recycling linear power supply has been implemented in 0. 35 um high-voltage CMOS process with fully considerations of process variations and mismatch. The fabricated linear power supply circuit occupies an active silicon area of 0. 45 mm 2, achieving maximum Power Saving Factor and Current Efficiency of 48. 6 % and 97. 2 %, respectively, with quiescent current of only 45 uA. Furthermore, with our current recycling technology, a dual-stacked topology can be easily extended to a multiple-stacked structure. A triple-stacked current recycling linear power supply has been implemented using 0. 35 um high-voltage CMOS process, achieving maximum Power Saving Factor and Current Efficiency of 65. 5 % and 96. 4 %, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{improve the}} voice quality of female laryngectomees and/or laryngectomees with a {{hypotonic}} pharyngoesophageal (PE) segment {{by means of}} a pneumatic artificial source of voice incorporated in a regular tracheoesophageal (TE) shunt valve. Study Design: Experimental, randomized, crossover trial. Methods: The new sound source consists of a single silicone lip, which performs an oscillatory movement driven by expired pulmonary air flowing along the outward-striking lip through the TE shunt valve. A prototype of this pneumatic sound source is evaluated in vitro and in six laryngectomees, In vivo evaluation includes speech rate, maximal phonation time, perceptual voice evaluation of read-aloud prose by an expert listener, speech intelligibility measurements with 12 listeners, and self-assessment by the patients. Moreover, extensive acoustical and aerodynamic in vivo registrations are performed using a newly developed data acquisition system. Results: The current prototype seems beneficial in female laryngectomees with a hypotonic PE segment only, For them the sound-producing voice prosthesis improves voice quality and increases the average pitch of voice, without decreasing intelligibility or necessitating other pressure and airflow rates than regular TE <b>shunt</b> speech. Pitch <b>regulation</b> of this prosthetic voice is possible, yet limited. Conclusions: The mechanism is feasible and does not result in unacceptable airflow resistance. For this new mechanism of alaryngeal voice to become an established technique for postlaryngectomy voice restoration, a voice suitably pitched for male laryngectomees has to be generated and {{a large part of the}} melodic and dynamic range of the sound source has to be attainable within physiological airflow rates...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: We {{examined}} {{the influence of}} <b>shunt</b> size on <b>regulation</b> of the pulmonary blood flow in a canine model of a univentricular heart because specific guidelines regarding suitable shunt size in the Norwood operation remain undetermined. Methods: Beagle dogs (n = 8) 3 to 7 months old and weighing 3. 0 to 5. 0 kg were used. Atrial septectomy and patch closure of the tricuspid valve were performed, and a systemic-pulmonary arterial shunt was created by interposing a 3. 5 - or 4. 0 -mm graft between the right subclavian artery and main pulmonary artery. After cardiopulmonary bypass, hemodynamic variables including pulmonary and systemic blood flow were measured consecutively according to physiologically respiratory manipulations. The ratio of shunt size to body weight ranged from 0. 80 to 1. 33 mm/kg (1. 08 ± 0. 16 mm/kg). Results: Each dog with a ratio of shunt size to body weight of 0. 8 to 1. 1 showed significant negative correlation between the pulmonary/systemic blood flow ratio and arterial Pco 2, but those with a ratio of shunt size to body weight of 1. 1 to 1. 4 did not. Consequently each dog with a ratio of shunt size to body weight of 0. 8 to 1. 0 got adequate systemic flow, whereas a ratio of 1. 0 to 1. 4 resulted in inadequate systemic flow and acidic status. Similar phenomena were shown with the grouped data on relationship between the pulmonary/systemic blood flow ratio and inspired oxygen fraction. Conclusions: These findings imply that when the ratio of shunt size to body weight is 0. 8 to 1. 1, the pulmonary/systemic blood flow ratio is controllable by physiologic respiratory manipulations. Larger shunts make pulmonary blood flow excessive and uncontrollable. We recommend that a ratio of shunt size to body weight of 0. 9 to 1. 0 be considered a useful index for suitable systemic-pulmonary arterial shunt in the Norwood operation.
