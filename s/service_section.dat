500|$|Even foreign black dignitaries {{were not}} immune to the {{discrimination}} that African-American travelers routinely encountered. In one high-profile incident, Komla Agbeli Gbedemah, the finance minister of newly independent Ghana, was refused service at a Howard Johnson's restaurant at Dover, Delaware, while traveling to Washington, D.C., even after identifying himself by his state position to the restaurant staff. The snub caused an international incident, to which an embarrassed President Dwight D. Eisenhower responded by inviting Gbedemah to breakfast at the White House. Repeated and sometimes violent incidents of discrimination directed against black African diplomats, particularly on U.S. Route 40 between New York and Washington, D.C., led to the administration of President John F. Kennedy setting up a Special Protocol <b>Service</b> <b>Section</b> within the State Department to assist black diplomats traveling and living within the United States. The State Department considered issuing copies of The Negro Motorist Green Book to black diplomats, but eventually decided against steering them to black-friendly public accommodations as it wanted them [...] "to {{have all of the}} privileges of whiteness." ...|$|E

500|$|Auxiliary Units were a {{specially}} trained and secret organisation that [...] {{would act as}} uniformed commandos to attack the flanks and rear of an enemy advance. They were organised around a core of regular army 'scout sections', supported by patrols [...] of 6 - 8 men recruited [...] from the Home Guard. Although [...] approval for the organisation had been given in June 1940, recruiting only began in early July. Each patrol was a self-contained cell, expected to be self-sufficient. There was, however, no means of communicating with them once {{they had gone to}} ground, which greatly reduced their strategic value. Each patrol was well-equipped and was provided with a concealed underground operational base, usually built in woodland and camouflaged. [...] Auxiliary Units were only expected to operate during an organised military campaign, with an expected lifespan of 14 days. [...] They were not, therefore, intended to operate as a long term resistance organisation. [...] The latter was the responsibility of the Secret Intelligence <b>Service</b> <b>Section</b> VII, which would have only begun to expand its operations once the country had actually been occupied, thus confining knowledge of its existence only to those men and women who would have been available at the time.|$|E

2500|$|With {{representation}} by the American Civil Liberties Union, Summers sued, {{alleging that}} the bar association's actions had infringed his First and Fourteenth amendment rights. The Supreme Court of Illinois held that 1) The courts had no jurisdiction over the issue, and thus no [...] "case or controversy" [...] existed under Article Three of the Constitution; and 2) The bar association had not discriminated against Summers {{on the basis of}} his religion but rather {{on the basis of his}} ability to uphold the military <b>service</b> <b>section</b> of the Illinois state constitution.|$|E

[...] Zhou's chief lieutenants were Gu Shunzhang, who had {{strong ties to}} Chinese secret societies and became an alternate member of the Politburo, and Xiang Zhongfa. Teke had four operational sections: one for the protection and safety of Party members; one for intelligence gathering; one for facilitating internal communications; and, one to conduct assassinations, a team that {{became known as the}} [...] "Red Squad" [...] (红队).|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{the early}} 1930s, {{transport}} aircraft in the Air Corps {{had been assigned to}} air depots and to service squadrons, although provisional transport squadrons had been formed for special projects. [...] By 1932 Major Hugh J. Kerr, Chief of the Field <b>Service</b> <b>Section</b> of the Materiel Division, proposed the formation of a transport squadron at each air depot to act as a cadre for the transport wing the Air Corps proposed to support a field army in the event of mobilization. [...] Major General Benjamin Foulois approved the formation of four provisional squadrons in November 1932.|$|E
2500|$|Initial work in {{the sector}} {{established}} a series of casemates in the Raismes Forest, between Valenciennes and the Belgian border. The casemates were built by the Commission d'Organisation des Régions Fortifiées (CORF), the Maginot Line's design and construction agency. As the fortification of the Escaut Front was commenced later than the main section of the Line to the east, funds were restricted by {{the impact of the}} Great Depression, which had reached France. The plan was also affected by political considerations, in which the fortification of the Belgian frontier was seen as a betrayal of the French plan for forward defense on Belgian territory. Most of the Escaut blockhouses built in 1936-37 were built under local initiatives to designs by the Army Engineering <b>Service</b> <b>Section</b> Technique du Génie (STG). The CORF lines in the Raismes Forest were augmented by lesser positions in the principal line of resistance constructed in 1936-37. In 1940 a few hasty fortifications were built to the rear of Valenciennes under the authority of the Study Commission for the Fortified Zones (Commission des Études des Zones Fortifiées" [...] (CEZF) [...] ).|$|E
