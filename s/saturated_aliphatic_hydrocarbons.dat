In contrast to the more familiar paraffin wax which contains mostly unbranched alkanes, microcrystalline wax contains a higher percentage of isoparaffinic (branched) hydrocarbons and naphthenic hydrocarbons. It is characterized by the fineness of its crystals in contrast to the larger crystal of paraffin wax. It consists of high molecular weight <b>saturated</b> <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> It is generally darker, more viscous, denser, tackier and more elastic than paraffin waxes, and has a higher molecular weight and melting point. The elastic and adhesive characteristics of microcrystalline waxes are related to the non-straight chain components which they contain. Typical microcrystalline wax crystal structure is small and thin, making them more flexible than paraffin wax. It is commonly used in cosmetic formulations.|$|E

This study was designed to remove asphaltenes from light crudes by solvent precipitation and to investigate the comparative performance of n-heptane (single solvent) and n-pentane/n-heptane (mixed solvent) in this regard. Each of three Nigerian crudes: Bonny Export, Bodo and Mogho crudes were first distilled at 350  °C to obtain the atmospheric residuum. Asphaltenes were precipitated from each residuum at different stirring times with single n-heptane and mixed n-pentane + n-heptane solvents. The precipitated asphaltenes were characterized with FTIR, UV–visible spectrophotometers while the maltenes were fractionated to obtain the various fractions. Results show that the asphaltenes were made up of <b>saturated</b> (cyclic <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons)</b> and unsaturated (substituted aromatic hydrocarbon). Also, aromatics to saturates ratio and resins to asphaltenes ratio was higher in Bonny Export and lower in Mogho crude, thus, indicating that Bonny Export has the lowest asphaltene precipitation risk while Mogho crude has the highest risk. The results also showed that resins stabilize asphaltenes in crude as addition of resins to the different crudes reduced the quantity of asphaltene precipitated.|$|R

40|$|The Gas Chromatograph-Ion Mobility Spectrometer (GC-IMS) was {{proposed}} as an analytical technique {{for the analysis}} of Titan's atmosphere during the Cassini Mission. The IMS is an atmospheric pressure, chemical detector that produces an identifying spectrum of each chemical species measured. When the IMS is combined with a GC as a GC-IMS, the GC is used to separate the sample into its individual components, or perhaps small groups of components. The IMS is then used to detect, quantify, and identify each sample component. Conventional IMS detection and identification of sample components depends upon a source of energetic radiation, such as beta radiation, which ionizes the atmospheric pressure host gas. This primary ionization initiates a sequence of ion-molecule reactions leading to the formation of sufficiently energetic positive or negative ions, which in turn ionize most constituents in the sample. In conventional IMS, this reaction sequence is dominated by the water cluster ion. However, many of the light hydrocarbons expected in Titan's atmosphere cannot be analyzed by IMS using this mechanism at the concentrations expected.

The production of complex molecules is thought to occur within dense molecular clouds when ice- mantled grains are processed by various energetic mechanisms. Studies of the processing of interstellar ices and the subsequent production of organic residues have relevance to studies of interplanetary dust, because primitive solar system bodies are likely reservoirs of organic material, either preserved from the interstellar medium or produced in situ. A comparison of the interstellar organics and the Murchison meteorite illustrates the importance of probing the interstellar connection to the solar system, because although the carbonaceous meteorites are undoubtedly highly processed, they do retain specific interstellar signatures (such as diamonds, SiC grains, graphite and enriched D/H). The organic component, while not proven interstellar, has a remarkable similarity to the interstellar organics observed in over a dozen sightlines through our galaxy. This paper compares spectra from laboratory organics produced through the processing of interstellar ice analog materials with the high resolution infrared observations of the interstellar medium in order to investigate the mechanisms (such as ion bombardment, plasma processing, and UV photolysis) that may be producing the organics in the ISM.

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Molecular {{connectivity}} is a topological descriptor of a molecule. It {{has been}} used as an independent variable to describe biological activities, physicochemical parameters (melting points, boiling points, partition coefficients) and chromatographic retention indices. There are inherent problems in using molecular connectivity. A zero connectivity term has two opposing meanings: 1) The connectivity term does not exist in a specific molecule and 2) The molecule is approaching infinite connectivity. This thesis is divided into four parts. Part I describes a study in which two methods of calculating molecular connectivity indices were evaluated. These were the traditional reciprocal square root and nontraditional approach. In each case, two involving biological responses and a third using connectivity to predict octanol-water partition coefficients, the molecular connectivity indices calculated by the traditional reciprocal square root method yielded superior results. This method of calculating indices was used for parts II IV of this thesis. Part II describes a study correlating molecular connectivity indices with gas chromatographic retention indices (Kovats indices) on two sets of compounds, 144 <b>saturated</b> <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> and 53 monounsaturated hydrocarbons. Using subsets from both populations of hydrocarbons, it was shown that the actual regression models using connectivity indices as independent variables are dependent on the particular compounds used to construct the regression equation. Part III compares the relative usefulness of partition coefficients and first order molecular connectivity indices in predicting gas chromatographic retention indices. In general both are equally effective. Both approaches are incapable of distinguishing between sets of alkane isomers with differing branching positions, alkene isomers with differing locations of double bonds, and cis and trans alkene isomers. Part IV examines the relationship of molecular connectivity with extrapolated R[subscript M] and log k' values in liquid chromatography of two sets of phenolic compounds. While good correlations were obtained, it was shown again that the choice of significant molecular connectivity indices is dependent on the particular set of compounds being evaluated...|$|E
40|$|We present new 3600 - 2700 /cm (2. 8 - 3. 7 micrometer) {{spectra of}} objects whose {{extinction}} {{is dominated by}} dust in the diffuse interstellar medium. The observations presented here augment an ongoing study of the organic component of the diffuse interstellar medium. These spectra contain a broad feature centered near 3300 /cm (3. 0 micrometers) and/or a feature with a more complex profile near 2950 /cm (3. 4 micrometers), the latter of which is attributed to <b>saturated</b> <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in interstellar grains and is the primary interest of this paper. As in our earlier work, the similarity of the absorption bands near 2950 /cm (3. 4 micrometers) along different lines of sight and the correlation of these features with interstellar extinction reveal that the carrier of this band lies in the dust in the diffuse interstellar medium (DISM). At least 2. 5 % of the cosmic carbon in the local interstellar medium and 4 % toward the Galactic center is {{tied up in the}} carrier of the 2950 /cm (3. 4 micrometer) band. The spectral structure of the diffuse dust hydrocarbon C-H stretch absorption features is reasonably similar to UV photolyzed laboratory ice residues and is quite similar to the carbonaceous component of the Murchison meteorite. The similarity between the DISM and the meteoritic spectrum suggests that some of the interstellar material originally incorporated into the solar nebula may have survived relatively untouched in primitive solar system bodies. Comparisons of the DISM spectrum to hydrogenated amorphous carbon and quenched carbonaceous composite are also presented. The A(sub V) /tau ratio for the 2950 /cm (3. 4 micrometer) feature is lower toward the Galactic center than toward sources in the local solar neighborhood (approximately 150 for the Galactic center sources vs. approximately 250 for the local ISM sources). A similar trend has been observed previously for silicates in the diffuse medium by Roche & Aitken, suggesting that (1) the silicate and carbonaceous materials in the DISM may be physically correlated and (2) there is either dust compositional variation in the galaxy or galactic variation in the grain population density distribution. We also note a possible absorption feature near 3050 /cm (3. 28 micrometers), a wavelength position that is characteristic of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) ...|$|E
40|$|We have {{obtained}} 5 - 8 micrometers spectra of the Galactic center from the Kuiper Airborne Observatory at resolving powers of approximately 50, approximately 150, and approximately 300. These spectra show absorption features at 5. 5, 5. 8, 6. 1, and 6. 8 micrometers. Together with previously observed {{features in the}} 3 micrometers region, these features are compared with laboratory spectra of candidate materials. The 3. 0 and 6. 1 micrometers features are due to the OH stretching and bending variations of H 2 O and are well fitted by water of hydration in silicates (e. g., talc). The 3. 0 micrometer band is equally well fitted by ice mixtures containing 30 % H 2 O, but such mixtures do not provide a good fit to the observed 6. 1 micrometer band. The 3. 4 and 6. 8 micrometers features are identified with the CH stretching and deformation modes in CH 2 and CH 3 groups in <b>saturated</b> <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> The 6. 1 micrometer band shows a short wavelength shoulder centered on 5. 8 micrometer, attributed to carbonyl (C double bond O) groups in this interstellar hydrocarbon dust component. Finally, the narrow 5. 5 micrometer feature is also attributed to carbonyl groups, but {{in the form of}} metal carbonyls [e. g., Fe(CO) 4]. We have derived column densities and abundances along the line of sight toward the Galactic center for the various identified dust components. This analysis shows that hydrocarbon grains contain only 0. 08 of the elemental abundance of C and contribute only a relatively minor fraction (0. 1) of the total dust volume. Most of the interstellar dust volume is made up of silicates (approximately 0. 6). Small graphite grains, responsible for the 2200 angstroms bump, account for 0. 07 of the total dust volume. The remaining one-quarter of the interstellar dust volume consists of a material(s) without strong IR absorption features. Likely candidates include large graphite grains, diamonds, or amorphous carbon grains, which all have weak or no IR active modes. Finally, various models for the origin of the hydrocarbon dust component of the interstellar dust are discussed. All of them face some problems in explaining the observations, in particular, the absence of the spectroscopic signature of hydrocrbon grains in sources associated with molecular clouds...|$|E
