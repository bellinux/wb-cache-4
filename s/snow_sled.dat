50|$|Five toys {{sit on a}} windowsill {{all waiting}} for {{something}} to happen. There is an owl waiting to see the moon, there is a pig with an umbrella waiting to see the rain, there is a puppy with a <b>snow</b> <b>sled</b> waiting to see the snow, there is a bear with a kite waiting to see the wind and finally there is a rabbit looking outside the window just happy to contemplate what is happening outside.|$|E
5000|$|Shooting Sports - [...] "Lead Sled" [...] is the {{registered}} trademark {{name of a}} device made by Caldwell Shooting Supplies. Roughly resembling a <b>snow</b> <b>sled</b> or toboggan, lead or cast iron weights {{can be added to}} increase stability. The user places the device on a bench or table, adds weight for stability, and uses the device's fixtures to secure a firearm in the [...] "sled" [...] for firing. The purpose of the device is to remove human error from the process of adjusting the firearm's sights or determining the accuracy of the firearm and reduce felt recoil to the shooter.|$|E
50|$|Many {{people used}} them as <b>snow</b> <b>sleds,</b> and a warning label was affixed advising against this use.|$|R
50|$|Coanda spent World War II in {{occupied}} France {{where he}} worked for the Nazis to help their war effort by developing the turbopropulseur (turbopropeller) drive system from his 1910 biplane into a propulsion system for <b>snow</b> <b>sleds.</b> The German contract concluded after one year, yielding no plans for production.|$|R
50|$|Much of the Front Country Ranger District is {{at a lower}} {{elevation}} {{and does}} not get much snow. Snowboarding and skiing are not recommended but <b>snow</b> <b>sledding</b> is acceptable if snow accrues. Mountaintop Ranger District (Lake Arrowhead/Big Bear) and Winter Resorts are recommended by the Front Country Ranger District.|$|R
5000|$|A snow shovel is {{a shovel}} {{designed}} for snow removal. Snow shovels come {{in several different}} designs, {{each of which is}} designed to move snow in a different way. Removing snow with a snow shovel has health risks, but can also have significant health benefits when the snow shovel is used correctly, especially when a modern kind of snow shovel is used that lets one remove snow without lifting it. These include <b>snow</b> <b>sled</b> shovels, also called snow scoops and sleigh shovels, which are large and deep hopper-like implements fitted with a wide handle and designed to scoop up a load of snow and slide it to another location without lifting.|$|E
5000|$|Old Waverly Golf Club, located {{outside of}} West Point and {{recognized}} as one of Mississippi's top golf courses, hosted the 1999 U.S. Women's Open, which was won by Juli Inkster. West Point Country Club is three minutes from downtown West Point and offers 18 rounds of golf, swimming, tennis and a club house. Payne Field was an advanced Aviation School operated from May 1918 to March 1920. About 1,500 pilots were trained there. It is recognized as the first airfield in the state of Mississippi. Despite averaging less than 1" [...] of snow a year West Point was the home of the original Blazon-Flexible Flyer, Inc. proclaimed to make the very best <b>snow</b> <b>sled</b> in the United States, which became an American tradition. It is called The Flexible Flyer.|$|E
50|$|In January 1925, Abel Gance began {{shooting}} Napoléon using a {{wide variety}} of innovative techniques, including strapping a camera to a man's chest, a <b>snow</b> <b>sled,</b> a horse's saddle, a pendulum swing, and wrapping a large sponge around a hand-held camera so that it could be punched by actors during a fight scene. For the Debrie Parvo camera strapped to the horse's saddle, Gance's technical director, engineer Simon Feldman, devised a reversed steam engine for cranking it, powered by two compressed air tanks. Wearing a costume to fit the scene, cameraman Jules Kruger rode another horse to tend the mechanism between shots. Rather than including one or two hand-held scenes for an unusual effect amid an otherwise static film, Gance strove to make his entire film appear as dynamic as possible. It premiered in early 1927.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1860s {{he became}} a logger and wished to devise {{a better way to}} move logs to the mill than on winter <b>snow</b> <b>sleds.</b> He built his own tramway in 1875, on [...] gauge track on wooden ties. This was much more {{efficient}} than his competitors because he could log all year round.|$|R
50|$|During the 1920s, German daredevils had {{experimented with}} using solid-fuel rockets to propel cars, motorcycles, railway carriages, <b>snow</b> <b>sleds,</b> and, by 1929, {{aircraft}} such as Alexander Lippisch's Ente and Fritz von Opel's RAK.1. Solid-fuel rockets, however, have major disadvantages when used for aircraft propulsion, as their thrust cannot be regulated, and the engines cannot {{be shut down}} once fired.|$|R
50|$|The Advance Motor Manufacturing Company was a British {{motorcycle}} {{and engine}} manufacturer established in 1905. As well as supplying aircraft engines to the pioneering monoplane developers, Advance engines {{were also used}} by Captain Robert Scott to power Antarctic <b>snow</b> <b>sleds.</b> After {{the end of the}} Second World War the company was sold to Sheepbridge Engineering and became a motor supplies organisation.|$|R

Drivers maneuver 15-ton Delta cargo vehicles equipped with large balloon-type tires over a more than 50-mile ice road. Alternatively, vehicles towing <b>snow</b> <b>sleds</b> are used to transport cargo. Drivers also deliver food, construction equipment, and scientific equipment that is staged at Marble Point for subsequent airlift to field camps.|$|R
50|$|On 28 April 1940, {{during the}} closing {{days of the}} Norwegian Campaign in South Norway, German prisoners of war from the Norwegian 2nd Division's {{abandoned}} Lom prisoner of war camp and their guards arrived at Turtagrø. The prisoners and guards {{spent the night at}} Turtagrø on their way west to Vadheim in Sogn. The weakest of the prisoners were left under guard at the hotel, later to be retrieved by <b>snow</b> <b>sleds.</b>|$|R
50|$|Kim {{grew up in}} Pennsylvania and was {{the first}} child of parents who immigrated to the United States from Korea. She did well in science and math studies, and {{graduated}} from Dartmouth College in 1996 with a degree in Psychology. She considered becoming a doctor until deciding against it after a depressing month-long hospital stay due to an incident in which she broke her back while <b>snow</b> <b>sledding</b> on a golf course using a cafeteria tray.|$|R
25|$|U.S. ships {{discharged}} cargo at temporary iceports in McMurdo Sound {{prior to}} the military’s invention of the ice pier. Ships during that time moored alongside seasonal pack ice where military longshoremen offloaded cargo onto large <b>snow</b> <b>sleds.</b> Equipment operators then used snow cats and tractors to tow the freight over ice to McMurdo, a difficult and potentially dangerous operation. Tankers arriving with oil, diesel fuel, and gasoline were forced to dock {{as far away as}} ten miles (16km) from the harbour and pump their fuel ashore.|$|R
50|$|In 1987 {{he began}} {{developing}} power kites for traction uses, and designing boats, buggies, boards and <b>snow</b> <b>sleds</b> {{to use with}} them. The sport of kite buggying in its modern form began from a kitesailing craft he developed. It was equipped with three 'skis' and was quite unsuccessful on the water. In 1990 he converted it to a land buggy by replacing the skis with wheels. More than 10,000 of his buggies are now in use, {{and there are also}} many other kite buggy manufacturers. Kite buggying has become a popular worldwide sport.|$|R
50|$|During autumn the {{training}} continued with group exercises and a basic winter training where one learned {{the basics of}} combat and survival in winter. There the skis was the basis of everything. To move long distances, pulling <b>snow</b> <b>sleds,</b> bury themselves in the snow bivouacs, shoot and dress properly. Also mountaineering was included. The last few months consisted of combat and intelligence training in the platoon and company. The soldiers spent days or {{a week in the}} field, then recovered and then went out in the field again. Everything ended with the joint exercise of the military area.|$|R
60|$|It {{was well}} that he did this, {{otherwise}} he might have missed poor Tom, who lay in a slight hollow, partly covered with <b>snow.</b> The <b>sled</b> had hit a rock and the poor youth had been flung out with great force, landing on one shoulder and on his head.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed to {{determine}} the wear properties of nanosilica filled epoxy polymers and FRP composites. Woven fiberglass has been deployed as the reinforcement material. The fibers were mixed with three different percentages of nanosilica-modified epoxy resin, i. e: 5 wt%; 13 wt%; 25 wt%, in order to fabricate the desired samples of FRP composites. The effect of nanosilica on wear properties was evaluated using dry sliding wear and slurry tests. The results show that {{increasing the amount of}} nanosilica content has reduced the amount of accumulated mass loss. It was found that the FRP laminates with 25 wt% of nanosilica have the highest wear resistance. The nanosilica filled fiber reinforced polymer composites have a high potential in tribological application such as ball bearing housing and <b>snow</b> <b>sleds...</b>|$|R

25|$|On 26 April 1940 Lieutenant Colonel Dannevig was {{informed}} that the Germans were about to capture the town of Otta, cutting off the Otta Valley. The commander of the 2nd Division, General Jacob Hvinden Haug, authorized Dannevig to do as he saw best with the forces at his command. Dannevig decided to evacuate the camp and march his troops and prisoners over the mountains to join the Norwegian 4th Division in Sogn. All the prisoners were taken along, while {{about half of the}} Norwegian soldiers were dismissed because of insufficient skiing skills. The march westwards began at 1000hrs on 27 April, the German prisoners dragging ski sleds across the snow-clad mountains. The first night was spent at Krosbu. Many prisoners soon suffered from snow blindness and exhaustion, some having to be left behind at the hotel Turtagrø, where the column spent the second night, to be retrieved later by <b>snow</b> <b>sleds.</b> Over several days the prisoners were brought by boat to Vadheim in Sogn. By the time the prisoners reached Vadheim resistance in the southern parts of Norway was ending and the Germans were left to themselves. Dannevig's militia unit was disbanded on 1 May 1940.|$|R
5000|$|The {{climate in}} the Dorrington/Camp Connell area is {{generally}} pleasant.
