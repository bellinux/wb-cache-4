40|$|In South Asia, {{a number}} of {{developing}} countries like India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Nepal, Afghanistan and Maldives are looking into inexhaustible and repeatable alternative energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro and biomass. Geographically, <b>South</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>countries</b> are located in a region of different climatic conditions such as tropical, humid etc. which provides easy access {{to a variety of}} renewable energy sources. The governments of <b>South</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>countries</b> have initiated renewable energy policies to encourage industries and individuals to employ renewable energy powered systems in power applications. This article provides an updated and comprehensive overview of the renewable energy status in the <b>South</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>countries,</b> and it includes an assessment of the region's renewable potential, current installed renewable energy capacity. This paper gives a brief description about energy scenario, renewable energy potential and challenges in <b>South</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>countries.</b> The study also provides the renewable energy policies and recommendation in <b>South</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>countries...</b>|$|R

The analysis evinces that under complete integration, in terms of tariff elimination, under these three mega deals, the excluded <b>South</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>countries</b> could face a tremendous negative impact on their economies. The analysis also suggests that South Asia may consider joining the TPP to minimize the negative economic impact due to arise from these mega deals. TPP; TTIP; RCEP; South Asia; GTAP; CG...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} three decades, the {{services}} sector has boomed in the <b>South</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>countries.</b> Alongside the growth, liberalisation of the services trade too has become a critical economic agenda for these economies. Some of their services sectors have been liberalised {{as part of their}} commitment under GATS. Under the request-offer process of GATS, there have been requests from other developing and developed countries to open up services sectors of the <b>South</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>countries.</b> Additionally, they have also taken steps for the unilateral liberalisation of the sector. <b>South</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>countries</b> have also taken initiatives to liberalise trade in services among themselves. The latest development of these initiative is the <b>South</b> <b>Asian</b> Agreement on Trade in Services (SATIS) in 2010.

40|$|All five <b>South</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>countries</b> (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal) {{have been}} {{following}} consistent economic reform policy measures emphasizing the market economy and aimed at integrating their economies {{with the rest of}} the world. Consequently, all except Pakistan have experienced higher economic growth and an improvement in most macro economic indicators both in the domestic and external sector. Indeed, the <b>South</b> <b>Asian</b> region has been one of the fastest growing regions in the world in recent years. Overall, the FDI environment has undergone a sea change in <b>South</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>countries</b> during the 1990 s, and more so in recent years. With their liberalized approach to FDI and constant changes in improving the FDI policy framework, it is certain that South Asia has become an important destination for investment. Thus, one can conclude that there has been a positive change in policies with regard to FDI with efforts directed more towards bilateral trade agreements and providing investment incentives to foreign investors in all <b>South</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>countries.</b> However, there are still procedural delays, reserved industries where foreign investors are not allowed to invest and ceilings in many industries/sectors in each of these countries. Accelerating the economic reform process and making their economies politically stable and free from internal conflict would go a long way toward making South Asia an attractive destination for FDI. The basic indicators, including infrastructure, show that all five <b>south</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>countries</b> lack adequate infrastructure facilities and governance. Thus, more effective public investment on economic and social infrastructure, along with stable economic policies to create an enabling environment, would attract more foreign direct investment. Analyses of FDI flows to <b>south</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>countries</b> reveal that there has been an increasing trend of FDI into <b>South</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>countries.</b> However, apart from India, the share as well as the absolute volume of FDI inflow to these countries is negligible. FDI in South Asia is mostly concentrated in manufacturing and services. An analysis of FDI inflows to different sectors shows that FDI is largely domestic market oriented in India and Pakistan, whereas it is concentrated in a few export-oriented industries in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. The results of FDI impact on growth show that FDI has a positive and significant impact on growth for four <b>south</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>countries.</b> Other significant factors that contribute to growth are exports, gross domestic capital formation and infrastructure. Therefore <b>South</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>countries</b> need to improve their domestic investment, exports and infrastructure facilities, along with more foreign investment, to achieve higher growth. Further, FDI has a positive impact on export growth through its positive spillovers for <b>South</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>countries.</b> Though FDI does not affect domestic investment in the current period, it has a positive and significant impact affect over time through dynamic effects. The results of a panel cointegration estimation reveal that FDI and all its potential determinants have a long run equilibrium relationship. Major determinants of FDI in South Asia are market size, labor force growth, infrastructure index and trade openness. Overall, <b>South</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>countries</b> need to maintain growth momentum to improve the market size, frame policies for better use of the abundant labor force, improve infrastructure facilities and follow more open trade policies to attract increased FDI...|$|R
