500|$|The {{episode was}} storyboarded by artist Anthony Williams. Davies offered Edgar Wright the {{opportunity}} to direct the episode, but Wright was forced to decline, as he was still working on Shaun of the Dead. Instead, the episode was directed by Keith Boak. [...] "Rose" [...] began filming in July 2004, {{as part of the}} first production block alongside episodes four and five. The first five days were spent filming in London, while the rest was filmed in Cardiff. The production team was given permission to add more lights to the London Eye. For the scene in which the Doctor and Rose are running through London, careful timing was undertaken by the production team because they wanted a London bus to travel behind them, but this had to be accomplished by waiting for a bus to come. In other scenes filmed in Cardiff, a London bus and a van of the London Evening Standard drove by to give the illusion of London. The exterior of Rose's council estate was filmed at a London estate as well as a Cardiff one in other scenes. Mickey's flat is the same set as the Tyler's, just redecorated. The production team sought to film the Cardiff scenes in secrecy, but the day before they began the Cardiff Council issued a press release naming the streets where they would be filming. The Autons' attack during the climax was filmed on Working Street, Cardiff from 20 to 22 July 2004. with scenes set around major London landmarks like the London Eye being the exception. Henrik's, where Rose works, is actually the department store Howells, and the pizza restaurant is La Fosse. It took the production team a while to find a restaurant that would require minimal set dressing but would be willing to close for a day. The street where Rose joins the Doctor is St David's Market, while <b>service</b> <b>tunnels</b> {{in the basement of a}} hospital in Cardiff were used for the basement of Henrik's where Rose is menaced by Autons. Studio filming mainly took place from August to October 2004.|$|E
500|$|Station {{reconstruction}} {{to accommodate}} the Victoria line was described as the most time-consuming for the Victoria line project. To handle the additional Victoria line passenger loads, a new ticket hall was constructed directly under the road junction. Separate banks of escalators to each line were to be built, with the existing structure {{to be used as}} exits with The lifts to be removed. A new one-way interchange subways system was to be built between the Bakerloo/Victoria lines and the Central line. To excavate the new ticket hall below the roadway, traffic was diverted for {{five and a half years}} (August 1963 to Easter 1968) onto a temporary bridge-like structure known as the [...] "umbrella" [...] covering the Regent Street/Oxford Street intersection. It consisted of 245 pieces of separate prefabricated steel work. The deck plates were placed on top of a system of steel girders which in turn rested on 25 cylindrical 3ft diameter concrete foundations, sunk from 43 up to 73ft deep at night. The cylindrical piles had to clear the sites of the main and secondary roof beams of the new ticket hall and various low-level obstructions. The piles had to be built with wide footings to avoid them from collapsing. <b>Service</b> <b>tunnels</b> were constructed to carry water mains and telecom cables past the new ticket hall. The umbrella deck was extended eastwards along Oxford Street to facilitate the construction of a connecting passageway between the old and new ticket halls during the weekend of the August Bank Holiday in 1966. Construction of the Victoria line station tunnels with their platforms, the new escalator shafts and the linking passages to the Central line platforms was carried out from access shafts sunk from nearby Cavendish Square, Upper Regent Street and Argyll Street. For the construction of the southbound Victoria line platform tunnel, a special design of tunnel segment, fabricated with mild steel was adopted as there was limited space available for the construction of the platform tunnel. A pre-stressed concrete raft was constructed below the Peter Robinson's third basement level as an extra precaution against settlement before driving the platform tunnel. The interchange passageway between the Central line and the Bakerloo line in the area of the former junction with the Bakerloo line lift landing was replaced by the southbound Victoria line platform tunnel. From there, a pilot tunnel Ventilation systems were rearranged with a new ventilation plant installed in the former Bakerloo line lift shaft. A new substation for the Bakerloo line was built at the bottom of the shaft. With the additional escalators in place, the one-way circulation scheme was introduced and the remaining lifts were removed.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the firm capitalised on work funded by British Rail to develop means of calculating the {{aerodynamic}} behaviour of high-speed trains in long, complex tunnel systems (the resulting methods are still used today to design tunnels for rail traffic). MHA and French firm SETEC were appointed as joint advisers to the British and French Channel Tunnel Companies, who proposed a workable scheme. Exploratory construction contracts were let, but the British Government abandoned the scheme in 1975, {{with the first}} tunnel boring machine (built to dig the <b>service</b> <b>tunnel)</b> literally sitting on its launch frame. Despite the lack of funding, a short section of <b>service</b> <b>tunnel</b> was dug beneath the English coast through ground that had been filled with instruments to assess {{the performance of the}} TBM.

50|$|A tunnel {{is said to}} {{run from}} Newbury Town Hall to St Nicolas Church.

A tunnel is also said to run from Newbury Castle (400 ft above sea level) and Shaw House (260 ft, thus 140 ft below it). The point of entry {{is said to be a}} hollow space (now blocked) in the south-east angle of the enclosure. In 1930 workmen investigated the legend by excavating the entrance, but found nothing.|$|E

Lighting installed in <b>service</b> <b>tunnels</b> that run around the outside of the toilets provides optimum safety from electrical shock (keeping the lights outside the toilet), hygiene (no cracks or openings), security (no way for vandals to access the light bulbs), and aesthetics (clean architectural lines that maintain a continuity of whatever aesthetic design is present, e.g., the raw industrial urban aesthetic that works well with glass brick).|$|E

50|$|The {{objective}} was to construct two 7.6 m rail tunnels, 30 m apart, 50 km in length; a 4.8 m <b>service</b> <b>tunnel</b> between the two main ones; pairs of 3.3 m cross-passages linking the rail <b>tunnels</b> to the <b>service</b> one at 375 m spacing; piston relief ducts 2 m in diameter connecting the rail tunnels 250 m apart; two undersea crossover caverns to connect the rail <b>tunnels,</b> with the <b>service</b> <b>tunnel</b> always preceding the main ones by at least 1 km to ascertain the ground conditions.
