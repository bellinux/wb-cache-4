40|$|In ‘Essential stuff' (2008) and ‘Stuff' (2009), Kristie Miller {{argues that}} two {{generally}} accepted theses, often formulated as follows, are incompatible: - (Temporal) mereological essentialism for <b>stuff</b> (or matter), {{the thesis that}} any portion of <b>stuff</b> has the same parts at every time it exists. - <b>Stuff</b> composition, the thesis that for any two portions of <b>stuff,</b> there exists a portion of <b>stuff</b> that is their mereological sum (or fusion). She does this by considering competing hypotheses about <b>stuff,</b> trying to prove inconsistency in all cases and with all corresponding understandings of mereological essentialism and <b>stuff</b> composition.

5|$|American Pharoah {{made his}} track debut in a maiden race over {{six and a}} half furlongs on the Polytrack surface at Del Mar Racetrack on August9.

He ran in a blinker hood, which appeared to unnerve him, as did the commotion in the saddling paddock.

5|$|Diệm's {{government}} formulated procedural regulations ostensibly {{designed to}} ensure results and ballots were correctly accounted for and to prevent election fraud. In reality however, the votes were counted without independent supervision, which resulted in Diệm being credited with 98.2% of the vote. The prime minister tallied 605,025 votes in Saigon, although only 450,000 voters were registered in the capital. Diệm's tally exceeded the registration numbers in other districts. French newspapers claimed that {{only half of the}} registered voters in Saigon had actually voted, and that the rest had boycotted the election, implying that more than 60% of the votes in the capital were not authentic. Defenders of Diệm claim this was due to recently arrived, mostly Catholic, refugees from North Vietnam who voted without being enrolled, rather than large-scale ballot <b>stuffing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium {{seeds and}} stems are edible {{and are used}} in {{traditional}} Native American cuisine by Alaska Natives, Inuit and Inupiat people. The leaves and roots of E.angustifolium are also edible and, because of their astringent properties, used by the Yupik peoples for medicinal purposes, {{through a process of}} decoction, infusion or poultice, to treat aliments of the human gastrointestinal tract, and in the Old World for the treatment of diarrhoea. In abundance, E.angustifolium can grow with enough density to disguise wetland and bog. Consequently, it may be used as a natural indicator of areas which are hazardous and to avoid travelling through. Attempts to make a cotton-like thread from the hairs of the plant's seed-heads have been thwarted by its brittleness, but it has been used in the production of paper and candle wicks in Germany, and was used as a feather substitute in pillow <b>stuffing</b> in Sweden and Sussex, England. In Scotland, during World War I, it was used to dress wounds.|$|E
