40|$|We {{present the}} first study to examine {{indicators}} of autonomic arousal associated with shifts in body image and {{as a function of}} predisposition to report spontaneous anomalous bodily experiences (ABEs) from nonclinical samples. Participants completed the Temporal-Lobe Experience subscale of the Cardiff Anomalous Perception scale-a measure associated with anomalous experiences resulting from temporal lobe dysfunction (Bell, Halligan, & Ellis, 2006) followed by a rubber-hand illusion experiment. We examined: (a) the time taken to induce the illusion, (b) effects on the <b>tonic</b> <b>skin</b> conductance level, and (c) phasic skin conductance responses in the form of nonspecific skin conductance responses (NS-SCRs) in the period leading up to the declaration of the illusion. The illusion took significantly longer to induce in those reporting high levels of ABEs, relative to those reporting low levels of such experiences. A significant increase in the <b>tonic</b> <b>skin</b> conductance level and the frequency of NS-SCRs occurred in the period leading directly up to the declaration of the illusion. Both measures were significantly increased for those reporting higher-levels of ABEs. The data question generic notions of "weak" body representations subserving increasing malleability in body image. Instead, they lend general support for a "dysconnection" account of anomalous bodily experiences-at least for some nonclinical hallucinators. Theoretical considerations are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In healthy {{subjects}} with high hypnotisability (highs) under hypnosis, subjectively effective suggestions for analgesia abolish {{the increases in}} blood pressure associated with cold pressor test (cpt) by reducing the peripheral vascular resistance. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effects of the suggestions of analgesia on the responses to cpt in healthy highs (n = 22) and in low hypnotisable participants (lows, n = 22) out of hypnosis. Cpt was administered without (CPT) and with suggestions for analgesia (CPT+AN). Psychophysical (pain intensity, pain threshold, cpt duration (time of immersion) and pain tolerance, defined as the difference between cpt duration and pain threshold), respiratory (amplitude and frequency) and autonomic variables (<b>tonic</b> <b>skin</b> conductance, mean RR interval (RR = 1 /heart rate), blood pressure, skin blood flow) were studied. The suggestions for analgesia increased cpt duration and RR in both groups, but decreased pain intensity and enhanced pain threshold only in highs; in both groups they did not modulate systolic blood pressure, <b>tonic</b> <b>skin</b> conductance and skin blood flow; thus, increased parasympathetic activity appears responsible for the heart rate reduction induced by suggestions in both groups. In conclusion, our findings show that suggestions modulate pain experience differentially in highs and lows, and are partially effective also in lows. We hypothesize that the mechanisms responsible for the efficacy of suggestions in healthy lows may be involved also in their efficacy in chronic pain patients with low hypnotisability...|$|R

30|$|This {{theme is}} also echoed in our {{supplemental}} data sources. In an interview, Bill Gates advises, ‘I watch the competitive landscape carefully. Microsoft is always {{searching for the}} new thing that is coming along, whether {{it is in a}} research lab or at another company. We try to understand what other people are doing, even if their apparent mission is so distant that it is not obvious competition’ (Gates 1997). In the same interview, Mr. Gates continues, “I don’t settle for platitudes when discussing management challenges. A well-chosen platitude can get people thinking in an appropriate framework. What annoys me is the manager whose only contribution is spouting platitudes such as ‘We should only do what the customer wants.’ This is a poor substitute for thoughtfulness. Of course you want to please customers, but how? What trade-offs are involved?” (Gates 1997). Mary Kay Ash “thought she might stay at home and write a career guide that would help other women avoid the pitfalls that had marred her working life. She began making notes of all her negative experiences in business and then made extensive lists of positive experiences that might result in better productivity and happier, more confident employees. What began as an outlet for personal frustration became, in a period of weeks, a blueprint for a workable direct-sales company, the dream company for which Ash herself would love to work. Then, an idea occurred to her: perhaps she should start such a company herself. All she needed was a product, something that could be used up and re-ordered again and again. For nearly a decade Ash had been buying skin softeners from the daughter of a hide tanner who had developed the formulas from tanning solutions. The potions smelled terrible but were very effective in keeping her skin young looking and smooth. Recalling her use of the home brewed <b>skin</b> <b>tonics,</b> Ash told People: They were dark orange and smelled like a skunk, but they made my skin so soft. I’d be giving a Stanley demonstration, and a client would say, ‘We know about that bowl cleaner, tell us what you've done to your face.’ Ash had discovered her product. Using her life savings of $ 5, 000, she bought the recipes for the skin softeners, furnished a modest storefront in Dallas, and set up a small manufacturing plant. Her first employees included her husband, who handled the legal and financial matters relating to the business; a chemist to create a line of basic skin care products; and a sales force of nine of her friends” (The Pink Producers 1981).|$|R
40|$|Most brain related {{databases}} {{bring together}} specialized information, {{with a growing}} number that include neuroimaging measures. This article outlines the potential use and insights from the first entirely standardized and centralized database, which integrates information from neuroimaging measures (EEG, event related potential (ERP), structural/functional MRI), arousal (skin conductance responses (SCR) s, heart rate, respiration), neuropsychological and personality tests, genomics and demographics: The Brain Resource International Database. It comprises data from over 2, 000 “normative” subjects {{and a growing number}} of patients with neurological and psychiatric illnesses, acquired from over 50 laboratories (in the USA, United Kingdom, Holland, South Africa, Israel and Australia), all with identical equipment and experimental procedures. Three primary goals of this database are to quantify individual differences in normative brain function, to compare an individual's performance to their database peers, and to provide a robust normative framework for clinical assessment and treatment prediction. We present three example demonstrations in relation to these goals. First, we show how consistent age differences may be quantified when large subject numbers are available, using EEG and ERP data from nearly 2, 000 stringently screened normative subjects. Second, the use of a normalization technique provides a means to compare clinical subjects (50 ADHD subjects in this study) to the normative database with the effects of age and gender taken into account. Third, we show how a profile of EEG/ERP and autonomic measures potentially provides a means to predict treatment response in ADHD subjects. The example data consists of EEG under eyes open and eyes closed and ERP data for auditory oddball, working memory and Go-NoGo paradigms. Autonomic measures of <b>skin</b> conductance (<b>tonic</b> <b>skin</b> conductance level, SCL, and phasic skin conductance responses, SCRs) were acquired simultaneously with central EEG/ERP measures. The findings show that the power of large samples, tested using standardized protocols, allows for the quantification of individual differences that can subsequently be used to control such variation and to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of comparisons between normative and clinical groups. In terms of broader significance, the combination of size and multidimensional measures tapping the brain's core cognitive competencies, may provide a normative and evidence-based framework for individually-based assessments in “Personalized Medicine. ”. © 2005, EEG and Clinical Neuroscience Society.

Heart rate (HR), respiratory frequency (RF), <b>tonic</b> <b>skin</b> resistance and different electroencephalographic rhythms were evaluated during a long-lasting hypnotic session including the guided suggestion of a neutral (NS) and an unpleasant (US) imagery, each preceded by a hypnotic relaxation rest period. During NS, the absence of autonomic changes, associated with electroencephalographic gamma power decrement and theta 1 power increment, indicated the prevalence of relaxation on the expected task-related modifications. In contrast, US elicited HR and RF increments together with higher electroencephalographic gamma, beta 3 and beta 2 activities. Thus, hypnotic state appears to prevent the autonomic responses expected during the neutral stimulation, while the emotional valence of the unpleasant imagery overwhelms the hypnosis-related relaxation...|$|R
40|$|Historical {{developments}} of cinema technology {{have contributed to}} the apparent reality of movie-goers 2 ̆ 7 experience. The current study uses both self-report and physiological measures (heart-rate, skin conductance, skin temperature) as indices of 29 participants 2 ̆ 7 negative emotional arousal, so as to investigate the effect of increasing a movie 2 ̆ 7 s perceptual realism (i. e., stereoscopic depth) on emotional experience. Data were recorded while half of the participants viewed emotional movie scenes in 3 D and half viewed them in 2 D. The groups did not differ significantly in terms of their self-reported feelings of negative emotional arousal, <b>tonic</b> <b>skin</b> conductance level or skin temperature. However, the 3 D group reported their experience as significantly more perceptually realistic (natural), and they also demonstrated a significantly higher heart-rate change-score than their counterparts in the 2 D condition. Importantly, the current study provides evidence that these results are not due to group differences in emotional sensitivity, engagement, or the novelty of the 3 D effect. Group differences in heart-rate, but not skin conductance level, suggest that increasing stereoscopic depth reduces the emotional regulation processes. Although caution is expressed about assumptions of causation, consideration is given to the idea that increased physiological arousal contributes to perceived apparent reality and vice versa...|$|R
40|$|Though anecdotal reports link certain speech {{disorders}} to {{increases in}} autonomic arousal, little research has described the relationship between arousal and speech processes in typical speakers. Additionally, {{it is unclear how}} increases in arousal may interact with other cognitive-linguistic processes to affect speech motor control. The primary goal of this experiment was to examine the interactions between autonomic arousal, linguistic processing, and speech motor coordination in adults and children. Autonomic responses (heart rate, finger pulse volume, <b>tonic</b> <b>skin</b> conductance, and phasic skin conductance) were recorded simultaneously with upper and lower lip kinematic data during speech. The lip aperture variability (LA Coordination Index) across multiple repetitions of sentences that varied in length and syntactic complexity was calculated under low- and high-arousal conditions. High arousal conditions were elicited by performance of the Stroop color word task. Results indicated that children had significantly higher coordination indices across all speaking tasks, indicating more variable speech motor coordination. Increases in syntactic complexity and utterance length were associated with increases in the speech motor coordination variability in both speaker groups. There was a significant effect of Stroop task (associated with increases in arousal) on the speech motor coordination of both adults and children, indicating that high arousal levels can influence speech motor control in both adults and children. ...|$|R
40|$|Subjects {{with high}} hypnotizability scores (Highs) have been {{considered}} more prone to experience negative affect and more vulnerable to its autonomic effects with respect to low hypnotizable individuals (Lows). The aim {{of the study was}} to analyze the subjective experience, <b>tonic</b> <b>skin</b> conductance (SC), respiratory fre- quency (RF), heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) of healthy Highs and Lows during a long-lasting, emotionally neutral task (Session R, 46 subjects) and a moderately threatening one (Session T, 35 subjects). At the end of the relaxing Session R, all participants reported an increased relaxation. At the end of the threat- ening Session T, only 20 subjects reported a decreased relaxation (effective T: eT subsample). Highs and Lows of this subsample reported a similarly reduced relaxation and showed a similarly increased skin conductance. HR and HRV did not differ between the two sessions and between Highs and Lows. Among the subjects not reporting decreased relaxation at the end of Session T (ineffective T: iT subsample, n= 15), relaxation was deeper and associated with lower skin conductance in Highs, although HR and HRV did not differ between Highs and Lows. All together, the results do not support the hypothesis of higher proneness of Highs to ex- perience negative affect and to exhibit the autonomic correlates of negative emotion...|$|R
40|$|The {{cognitive}} {{characteristics of}} highly hypnotizable subjects (Highs) {{allow them to}} easily modify their cognitive and autonomic state. Under hypnosis, Highs receiving cognitive, fear-like stimulation exhibit the cardiovascular changes typical of fear/stress, but also show an EEG pattern indicating a balance between fear-induced arousal and hypnotic relaxation. Indeed, hypnosis is effective in the attenuation of both emotional experience and behaviour (emotional numbing). The aim of the present experiment {{was to investigate the}} possible different role of relaxation and suggestion in hypnotic emotional numbing. <b>Tonic</b> <b>skin</b> conductance, respirogram, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were recorded in 3 groups of hypnotized subjects: Group 1 received a fearful guided imagery associated with threat suggestions (Threat) followed by the same fearful suggestion associated with numbing instructions (relaxation and "No-Threat"); Group 2 received the same instructions in the opposite order of presentation; Group 3 received the fearful suggestion with threat instructions twice. The numbing suggestion reduced fear-related emotional experience and autonomic responses; if No-Threat preceded Threat, the heart rate, heart rate variability and blood pressure were also reduced during Threat, in spite of self reports of high negative emotion. Thus, 1) the subjective experience and the autonomic response to fear can be dissociated; 2) the efficacy of numbing suggestion is extended to a subsequent Threat stimulation; 3) habituation does not contribute to the numbing effect. The results indicate that the specific numbing suggestion is the main factor in hypnotic modulation of the experience of fear...|$|R
40|$|The {{cosmetic}} history starts around {{twelve thousand}} years ago, when Ancient Egyptians discovered the healing abilities of scented oils. Perfection and beauty {{have always been}} goals of all civilizations, in fact, cosmetics has played {{a prominent role in}} the advances from ancient civilization to the current lifestyle. Cosmetics have helped to change how people look, to heal sick bodies and to enable to express our religious beliefs. Cosmetic progress over time has not been progressive; this, at certain times it looked like cosmetics were going to disappear from public life. Ancient Egypt is the birthplace of cosmetics. Precisely in Ancient Egypt is where cosmetics became popular in different ways, such as maintain a better body, appearance or fashion, and also, a medical importance to a civilization that lived in very harsh desert conditions. To give an example, Egyptian women made regular use of deodorants, <b>skin</b> <b>tonics</b> and ointments, most of these consisting of donkey milk, yeast, honey, clay and oils. After this, Ancient Rome managed to build for an itself large empire that reached to the edges of known world, with access to vast resources and trade routes to the neighbouring civilizations; it quickly became enchanted with cosmetic products of all types. This came led by the invasion of the Roman Empire over the Greeks, when women belonging to that civilization extended their habits to Roman women, which employed extracts of lemon, rose and jasmine to soft their skin and clay, vinegar and bark to harden their breasts, among other things. Early 20 th century coinciding with the development of the chemical industry, remains {{as one of the most}} exciting times in the history of the cosmetics. During those years, a lot of new products were introduced to the market enabling radical change in fashion styles and society. These products are no longer a luxury and products become accessible to everyone. The First World War had a significant impact and was a parenthesis in this growing industry, which is recovered in the 50 s coinciding with the appearance of the products for skin tanning. After the 20 s, worldwide fashion stabilized into a popular style that was embraced b both older and younger female population. In turn, the 70 s brought big steps that changed forever the modern fashion with the hippy, punk and glam movements, for instance. Nowadays, the cosmetic industry occupies a large place in modern society. Desire of beauty and the investment in it, causes an intensive research of new methods and / or components and cosmetics. In turn, the availability of more precise techniques allows observing changes in skin parameters, and obtaining results of cosmetic products more effectively. Current and future challenges of the cosmetic major focus on prevention and protection from radiation, in an attempt to prevent damage to the skin surface. In a cosmetic, different molecules join together, which provide specific characteristics of odour, colour, etc. to the cosmetic product and free electrons can not unite with each other, due to the free electrons are already attached. This provides that within the container molecules are attracted to each other allowing a uniform product. All cosmetic has a common base: the active ingredient, excipients and additives. The first one refers to the components that perform the action which has been created the cosmetic, e. g. hydrate or reaffirm. The active ingredient can be classified in two distinct groups: the surface (or external impact) or deep (or internal impact). Moreover, additives are one of the most important parts of cosmetics, and where more studies are reversed. They could be natural or synthetic, but nowadays are being questioned for their safety and how they are obtained. For all this, there are researches to find natural substances capable of the same functions as synthetic, without doing any damage. Finally, the excipient is defined as the set of ingredients, formed by a high percentage of water, including the active ingredient and the other components, with the primary objective of transport. This work is done with a main objective, based on studying the potential application of Spirulina Platensis biomass and exopolysaccharides in cosmetics, such as a facial moisturizer. For this purpose, the cultivation of this alga with the successive release of exopolysaccharide, the culture medium and biomass will be studied, being extended with the evaluation of the addition of biomass and EPS in facial moisturizer, proposing a formulation for this. This work also studied the use of metal nanoparticles to improve the properties of Spirulina in the final product. The two main properties of the nanoparticles, which make it used in cosmetics, are its high surface area, which makes them highly reactive, and quantum effects influence the optical, electrical and magnetic behaviour of materials. One of the most curious is the use of nanoparticles in sunscreens. They are used to make creams that do not do white lumps, which are called unsightly, and guarantee a sunscreen more transparent, less viscous and more penetrating on the skin...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{extends the}} findings reported by Salzman and Klein (1978) concerning the skin conductance response (SCR) of {{the offspring of}} parents who had been hospitalized for a psychiatric illness. Skin conductance during rest and during experiments test-ing habituation and conditioning of the SCR was recorded in 7 -year-old (M = 42) and 10 -year-old (w = 57) children. Among the 7 -year-olds, 11 had a parent with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, 12 had a parent with a diagnosis of affec-tive psychosis and 19 had a nonpsychotic parent. Among the 10 -year-olds, the corresponding distribution was 13 (schizo-phrenic), 20 (affective), and 24 (nonpsychotic). The results indi-cate (1) no marked tendency to-ward either rapid or absent habituation in the offspring of schizophrenics; (2) evidence of significantly greater conditioning among the 10 -year-old offspring of schizophrenics; (3) only very weak evidence of greater respon-siveness to intense stimuli among the offspring of schizophrenics; (4) no evidence of differences in SCR recovery time among the three groups of children; and (5) differences between diagnostic groups among the 10 -year-old children {{in the pattern of}} <b>tonic</b> <b>skin</b> conductance levels across ex-periments. Differences in results between the two age groups were unexpected, but may represent either heterogeneity of diagnosis in the parents or developmental trends in electrodermal activity in the children.

Microfilm. ix, 175 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmAlthough it {{has been}} {{frequently}} claimed that regular physical exercise possesses stress-reducing properties, the actual scientific evidence which exists to support this claim is sparse. In addition, the relevant literature has almost exclusively emphasized endurance forms of exercise which contribute to an enhancement of cardiovascular fitness levels. When assessing the effects of cardiovascular fitness alone, the variables of fitness and exercise are by definition confounded, since {{it is difficult to}} enhance cardiovascular fitness without regular exercise. It is possible however, to regularly engage in some forms of exercise without significantly increasing cardiovascular fitness. The present study was designed {{to examine the effects of}} stress induction on several psychophysiological measures as a function of both cardiovascular fitness and exercise. Fifty-five male subjects were exposed to four psychological stressors, and effects on heart rate, <b>tonic</b> <b>skin</b> conductance levels, digital skin temperature, and forearm electromyogram were assessed. General linear model analyses revealed three major findings: 1. While quantity of exercise made no difference for Ss with high fitness levels, for Ss with low fitness levels high quantities of exercise resulted in a potentiation of the stress response. This was interpreted to mean that when an individual's fitness level is low. the act of engaging in high quantities of exercise may actually serve as a stressor itself. 2. When differences in stressor levels were controlled. Ss high in cardiovascular fitness demonstrated lower heart rate levels white recovering from exposure to the stressors. These results suggest that there may be a limited reduction in physiological reactivity to psychological stressors as a function of cardiovascular fitness. 3. When frequency of exercise was held constant, Ss who spent less time per session of exercise showed lower recovery skin conductance levels than those who spent more time per exercise session. suggesting there may be some optimal relationship between frequency and amount of exercise for reducing reactivity to psychological stressors. The results of this study clearly challenge the simple notion that "exercise reduces stress", and indicate that at the least this relationship is mediated by interrelationships between cardiovascular fitness, amount of exercise, and frequency of exercise...|$|R
