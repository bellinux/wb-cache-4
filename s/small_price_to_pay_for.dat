However, Labyrinth was criticized by the three reviewers of Zzap!64.

500|$|Aside from common {{criticism}} {{aimed at}} Carey's lack of vocal bombast, many made heavy comparisons to its predecessor, [...] "We Belong Together". Freedom Du Lac from The Washington Post compared the two heavily, while PopMatters's Evan Sawdey {{felt it was}} [...] "stealing the structure that made 'We Belong Together' such a great song." [...] In his critique, he continued [...] "For being an album {{from one of the}} world's biggest pop stars, its amazing how hook-free and dated if feels a mere two weeks after its release." [...] Slant Magazines critic and writer, Sal Cinquemani, wrote that the single [...] "isn't exactly filled with combustible energy and it lacks the full-throttle belting that accompanied the Return of the Voice three years ago, but it features all of the characteristics one expects from a latter-day Mariah track." [...] Rachel Devitt of Rhapsody expressed a desire to see Carey [...] "show off those legendary five octaves a bit more", while also noting the song's [...] "slightly paranoid/just-this-side-of-crazy lyrics threatening to hunt down her lover if he videos their tryst." [...] New York Daily News critic, David Hinckley, was critical on the song's simplicity, and wrote [...] " [...] a single that could have been cut by any one-hit diva-ette today – has scored a chart grand slam.

500|$|Tender Mercies {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Richard Corliss of Time {{declared it}} the [...] "best American {{movie of the}} new year". Carol Olten of The San Diego Union-Tribune declared Tender Mercies the best movie of 1983, and [...] "the most poignant, but forthright, film of the year, with a brilliant performance by Robert Duvall". Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote, [...] "This is a small, lovely and somewhat overloaded film about small-town life, loneliness, country music, marriage, divorce and parental love, and it deals {{with all of these}} things in equal measure. Still, the absence of a single, sharply dramatic story line is a relatively <b>small</b> <b>price</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the plainness and clarity with which these other issues are defined." [...] She also praised Beresford's direction, which she said lent the movie a light touch. The Times Canby wrote, [...] "In all respects Tender Mercies is so good that it has the effect of rediscovering a kind of film fiction that has been debased over the decades by hack moviemakers, working according to accepted formulas, frequently to the applause of the critics as well as the public." [...] Leonard Maltin gave it three out of four stars, applauding Duvall in particular and describing it as a [...] "winning but extremely low-key film", though he characterized Foote's screenplay as [...] "not so much a story as a series of vignettes". David Sterritt of The Christian Science Monitor praised the film for its values, for underscoring the good in people and for avoiding flashiness and quick cuts in favor of a subtle and deliberately paced story, while maintaining a PG rating and omitting sex, drugs and violence. He also felt, however, that it tended toward melodrama on a few occasions and that the soundtrack had [...] "a bit of syrupy music ... especially at the end".|$|E

6000|$|... § XX. The changes {{effected}} in form, however, {{were the}} {{least part of the}} evil principles of the Renaissance. As I have just said, its main mistake, in its early stages, was the unwholesome demand for perfection, at any cost. I hope enough has been advanced, in the chapter on the Nature of Gothic, to show the reader that perfection is not to be had from the general workman, but at the cost of everything,--of his whole life, thought, and energy. And Renaissance Europe thought this a <b>small</b> <b>price</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> manipulative perfection. Men like Verrocchio and Ghiberti were not to be had every day, nor in every place; and to require from the common workman execution or knowledge like theirs, was to require him to become their copyist. Their strength was great enough to enable them to join science with invention, method with emotion, finish with fire; but, in them, the invention and the fire were first, while Europe saw in them only the method and the finish. This was new to the minds of men, and they pursued it to the neglect of everything else. [...] "This," [...] they cried, [...] "we must have in all our work henceforward:" [...] and they were obeyed. The lower workman secured method and finish, and lost, in exchange for them, his soul.|$|E

Within half an hour Tom was safely ensconced {{in the corner of the}} carriage, with his shoulder braced back, secundum artem, and his arm supported by a sling. How quietly and deftly the two women slipped a shawl here and a rug there to save him from the jarring of the carriage! It is part of the angel nature of woman that when youth and strength are maimed and helpless they appeal to her more than they can ever do in the pride and flush of their power. Here lies the compensation of the unfortunate. Kate's dark blue eyes filled with ineffable compassion as she bent over him; and he, catching sight of that expression, felt a sudden new unaccountable spring of joy bubble up in his heart, which made all previous hopes and pleasures seem vapid and meaningless. The little god shoots hard and straight when his mark is still in the golden dawn of life. All the way back he lay with his head among the cushions, dreaming of ministering angels, his whole soul steeped in quiet contentment as it dwelt upon the sweet earnest eyes which had looked so tenderly into his. It had been an eventful day with the student. He had saved his side, he had broken his collar-bone, and now, most serious of all, he had realized that he was hopelessly in love.|$|E

How can I see so noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief? He is so gentle, yet so wise; {{his mind is}} so cultivated, and when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art, yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence. He is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck, apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests himself deeply in the projects of others. He has frequently conversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without disguise. He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken to secure it. I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my enterprise. One man's life or death were but a <b>small</b> <b>price</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race.
