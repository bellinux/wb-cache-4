5000|$|After {{great success}} in the 1962 World Championships and 1964 Winter Olympics, winning 5 medals {{including}} 3 golds, Goitschel was considered the world's best female skier. She continued her domination at the 1966 World Championships in Portillo, Chile, winning medals in all 4 events, with 3 golds and one silver. When the alpine skiing World Cup debuted {{a few months after}} those championships in January 1967, Goitschel was expected to again dominate the circuit that season. However, she narrowly lost the overall title to Nancy Greene of Canada, but did take the discipline cup in downhill and tied for the win in slalom with her compatriot Annie Famose [...] During the next season, she again missed the overall title, finishing only 4th while repeating as slalom champion. She won her final gold medal in slalom at the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, and then retired from ski racing after that season. Goitschel's total of 11 World Championships medals in alpine skiing is second all-time among women to the 15 won by Christl Cranz of Germany (<b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>note</b> <b>below).</b>|$|E

(<b>See</b> <b>the</b> links and <b>notes</b> <b>below).</b> <b>The</b> name took its origin from [...] "Rzecz Pospolita" [...] (Res Publica), but under the {{communist}} regime {{at the time the}} name was censored and not allowed. It has to be <b>noted,</b> that <b>the</b> band name was invented by Kris Caputa (Polish) currently residing in Victoria BC, Canada, who for the last thirty years worked in various fields of applied science, including astronomical instrumentation and numerical electrodynamics. One of the most notable member was the brother of Jann Castor, Zbigniew Ruciński, who was a guitar virtuoso - and it was him, who brought Grzegorz Ciechowski into the whole picture. The original art (black & white) was created by Ina Koneczna, an artist from Torun, which was later transformed (but based on her art) into black and white stripes that became the bands logo Republika {{became one of the most}} original European bands thanks to their specific anti-mainstream rock & roll songs and black-and-white performance motif. Their new wave-inspired music and lyrics, both catchy and poetic, forged a path into the Polish rock pantheon. Republika debuted at a new wave band concert in Torun in November 1981.|$|R
