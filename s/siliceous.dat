5|$|Geologists can {{classify}} {{oil shales}} {{on the basis}} of their composition as carbonate-rich shales, <b>siliceous</b> shales, or cannel shales.|$|E
5|$|In both localities, B.epica occurs among heath on cliff-top dunes of deep, white <b>siliceous</b> sand over limestone. It co-occurs with B.media in both localities, and B.praemorsa is {{also present}} at Point Culver. Toolinna Cove sand is {{somewhat}} alkaline, making B.epica and B.media the only Banksia species that grow in alkaline soil.|$|E
5|$|Scotch Run flows over Leck Kill soil, a {{deep and}} well-drained fine loamy soil for its entire length. However, the {{northern}} and southern edges of the watershed are on Hazleton soil, a deep, loamy, <b>siliceous,</b> well-drained soil.|$|E
5|$|These two localities are {{unusual in}} having cliff-top dunes of <b>siliceous</b> sand: cliff-top dunes are an unusual {{topographic}} formation, {{and nearly all}} soil in the area is calcareous. As Banksia species are intolerant of calcareous soils, and are not adapted to long range seed dispersal, the two populations of B.epica appear to be reproductively isolated. Nelson has suggested that {{there was once a}} continuous strip of <b>siliceous</b> sand along the coast, providing an extensive and unfragmented habitat for B.epica; rises in the sea level had submerged this strip, leaving only the cliff-top dunes as suitable habitat. The fact that the resultant isolated populations have not perceptibly speciated since then suggests that the species has been fragmented for only a short time, perhaps only since the Last Glacial Maximum.|$|E
5|$|As a result, most geysers form {{in places}} where there is {{volcanic}} rhyolite rock which dissolves in hot water and forms mineral deposits called <b>siliceous</b> sinter, or geyserite, along {{the inside of the}} plumbing systems which are very slender. Over time, these deposits strengthen the channel walls by cementing the rock together tightly, thus enabling the geyser to persist, as mentioned in the previous section.|$|E
5|$|Banksia epica is a shrub {{that grows}} {{on the south}} coast of Western Australia. A {{spreading}} bush with wedge-shaped serrated leaves and large creamy-yellow flower spikes, it grows up to 3½metres (11½ft) high. It is known only from two isolated populations in the remote south east of the state, near {{the western edge of}} the Great Australian Bight. Both populations occur among coastal heath on cliff-top dunes of <b>siliceous</b> sand.|$|E
5|$|Hawksbills {{are highly}} {{resilient}} and resistant to their prey. Some of the sponges they eat, such as Aaptos aaptos, Chondrilla nucula, Tethya actinia, Spheciospongia vesparium, and Suberites domuncula, are highly (often lethally) toxic to other organisms. In addition, hawksbills choose sponge species with {{significant numbers of}} <b>siliceous</b> spicules, such as Ancorina, Geodia (G. gibberosa), Ecionemia, and Placospongia.|$|E
5|$|A {{successful}} {{test for}} beryllium in air and on surfaces has been recently developed and published {{as an international}} voluntary consensus standard ASTM D7202. The procedure uses dilute ammonium bifluoride for dissolution and fluorescence detection with beryllium bound to sulfonated hydroxybenzoquinoline, allowing up to 100 times more sensitive detection than the recommended limit for beryllium concentration in the workplace. Fluorescence increases with increasing beryllium concentration. The new procedure has been successfully tested {{on a variety of}} surfaces and is effective for the dissolution and ultratrace detection of refractory beryllium oxide and <b>siliceous</b> beryllium (ASTM D7458).|$|E
5|$|Abundant and widespread, A.obovatus {{occurs on}} a wide range of soils, favouring soils in the acidic pH range 3.9–5.4. Like most Adenanthos species it is common on deeply leached <b>siliceous</b> sandplain sand. It also occurs on gravelly quartz sand derived from rock outcrops, such as on the rocky hillslopes of the Stirling Range. It is rarely found on gravelly {{lateritic}} soils. It is also one of the few Adenanthos species to grow well in moist environments; it will not tolerate seasonal waterlogging—that niche is filled by A.detmoldii—but thrives in damp soils not subject to waterlogging.|$|E
5|$|Cryolophosaurus {{originally}} was {{collected during the}} 1990–91 austral summer on Mount Kirkpatrick in the Beardmore Glacier region of the Transantarctic Mountains. The discovery was made by Hammer, a professor at Augustana College, and his team. The fossils {{were found in the}} <b>siliceous</b> siltstone of the Hanson Formation, formerly the upper Falla Formation, and dated to the Pliensbachian stage of the early Jurassic. Cryolophosaurus was the second dinosaur, and first theropod, to be discovered in Antarctica. It was discovered after Antarctopelta, but named earlier.|$|E
5|$|Cullacabardee {{is located}} over an {{unconfined}} aquifer {{known as the}} Gnangara Mound, a major supplier of scheme groundwater to the Perth Metropolitan Area. The area is classified as an underground Water Pollution Control Area under the Water Authority Act 1984 and a Priority 1 drinking water source by the Department of Water. A survey of soils {{in the area in}} April 1999 indicated that Cullacabardee's soil is located in the Bassendean Sand soil association, and is a leached white <b>siliceous</b> sand of mineral quartz, with negligible phosphorus retention capability. Vegetation is mainly low woodland forests of sheoak and banksia, with scattered jarrah.|$|E
5|$|Rocks from Incapillo {{are rich}} in sodium and have high ratios of {{lanthanum}} and samarium to ytterbium and high ratios of barium to lanthanum, as well as high lead-206 to lead-204 and strontium-87/strontium-86 ratios. These rare-earth element patterns {{are similar to the}} Late Miocene Maricunga Belt rocks and contrast to early Miocene rocks. The changes occurred {{at the same time as}} the arc migrated eastward, terminating activity in the Maricunga Belt. The element ratios are pronouncedly arc-like with some adakitic signatures. The rocks contain considerably more sodium and alumina than almost all Central Andes <b>siliceous</b> volcanic rocks.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, {{additional}} Dinocephalosaurus specimens {{were discovered}} from the slightly older Luoping locality, {{which has been}} dated to 245–244 million years old based on conodont biostratigraphy as well as preliminary radiometric dating. The specimens originate from bed 74 of the Luoping locality, in deposits located {{near the village of}} Dawazi, Luoping County, Yunnan, China. Bed 74 is part of a section composed of thin dark grey micritic limestone layers mixed with thicker layers of <b>siliceous</b> limestone and silty limestone, which extends downwards to bed 67.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two types}} of geysers: {{fountain}} geysers which erupt from pools of water, typically in a series of intense, even violent, bursts; and cone geysers which erupt from cones or mounds of <b>siliceous</b> sinter (including geyserite), usually in steady jets that last anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes. Old Faithful, perhaps the best-known geyser at Yellowstone National Park, {{is an example of a}} cone geyser. Grand Geyser, the tallest predictable geyser on earth, (although Geysir in Iceland is taller, it is not predictable), also at Yellowstone National Park, is an example of a fountain geyser.|$|E
5|$|Hot springs {{are closely}} {{associated}} with fumaroles, which are vents in an active volcanic area releasing steam and hot gases, such as sulfur dioxide. In general, the water is rotating groundwater that comes into contact with rocks heated by magma and finds openings to the surface. The formation of the springs depends both on the rocks the water has passed through and the profusion of volcanic discharges mixed with the groundwater. Iron oxide, iron sulfides and other substances usually colour pools of boiling mud brilliant yellow, red, brown or green. Hot springs comprising significantly softened silica may deposit it to form <b>siliceous</b> sinter, whereas those comprising softened calcium carbonate deposit spongy-looking calcareous rock called tufa. Overflow of the springs can build masses, spires or stepped terraces of calcareous sinter or tufa.|$|E
5|$|Like {{several other}} volcanoes in {{northern}} British Columbia, Level Mountain was volcanically active during past glacial periods. Its involvement with glaciation resulted in several interactions between magma and ice, affording multiple examples of glaciovolcanic processes. Evidence for contemporaneous volcanism and glaciation is widespread throughout the massif. This includes interlayered unconsolidated fluvioglacial and tuffaceous deposits, tills and glacial erratics {{at the base}} of tuffs and lava flows, lahars composed of till and agglomerate, tuyas on the uppermost surface of the shield and as outliers, till cemented by <b>siliceous</b> sinter and the presence of freshwater pillow basalts and volcano-glacial tuff breccias. It is possible that geothermal outputs at Level Mountain had an influence on dynamics of past ice sheets much like the modern Grímsvötn caldera is an important heat source beneath Vatnajökull in Iceland. However, like other large NCVP volcanoes, much of Level Mountain was formed prior to glaciation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Siliceous</b> sinter is porous, low-density, light-colored <b>siliceous</b> rock {{deposited}} by {{waters of}} hot springs and geysers.|$|E
25|$|Constituents {{that are}} {{permitted}} in Portland-composite cements are artificial pozzolans (blastfurnace slag (in fact a latent hydraulic binder), silica fume, and fly ashes), or natural pozzolans (<b>siliceous</b> or <b>siliceous</b> aluminous {{materials such as}} volcanic ash glasses, calcined clays and shale).|$|E
25|$|Great {{diversity}} of unicellular, marine algae with <b>siliceous</b> (opal) tests, 130 species.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to organic-walled cysts, {{there are also}} calcareous dinoflagellate cysts and <b>siliceous</b> dinoflagellate cysts.|$|E
25|$|Deposits of chert {{formed from}} the {{accumulation}} of <b>siliceous</b> skeletons of microscopic organisms such as radiolaria and diatoms.|$|E
25|$|Porcelanite is a {{term used}} for {{fine-grained}} <b>siliceous</b> rocks with a texture and a fracture resembling those of unglazed porcelain.|$|E
25|$|The outside {{layer of}} a diatom is also called a cribellum. It {{consists}} of a thin <b>siliceous</b> membrane covered with small pores.|$|E
25|$|Demonsponges are {{the most}} {{well-known}} type of sponge since they are used by humans. They are distinguished by a <b>siliceous</b> skeleton of two and four rayed spicules and contain the protein spongin.|$|E
25|$|In addition, white {{wines are}} also {{produced}} on land with a limestone sub-soil {{such as the}} chalky base of the Champagne wine region or the limestone under <b>siliceous</b> marl of Chassagne-Montrachet form the backdrop {{to some of the}} most prestigious wines in world.|$|E
25|$|The last quejigo, Quercus faginea subsp broteri {{requires}} the most moisture and is least resistant to cold. It is found principally {{in the southwest}} quadrant and prefers <b>siliceous</b> soils, somewhat cool. More frequently than in pure concentrations, it is found mixed with cork oaks and Holm oaks.|$|E
25|$|Sponge skeletons {{consist of}} either spongin or {{calcareous}} and <b>siliceous</b> spicules with some collagen molecules interspersed. The collagen holds the sponge cells together. Different lineages of sponges are distinguished {{based on the}} composition of their skeletons. The three main classes of sponges are Demospongiae, Hexactinellid, and Calcareous.|$|E
25|$|The Scots pine {{plays the}} same part in the other peninsular mountains, both <b>siliceous</b> and limy. It is {{accompanied}} and superseded at high altitude by piornales, dwarf junipers, and hummocky high mountain thickets. Their lower altitudinal limit remains patchy, having been extended {{at the expense of}} deciduous forests.|$|E
25|$|Micropaleontology can {{be roughly}} {{divided into four}} areas of study {{on the basis of}} {{microfossil}} composition: (a) calcareous, as in coccoliths and foraminifera, (b) phosphatic, as in the study of some vertebrates, (c) <b>siliceous,</b> as in diatoms and radiolaria, or (d) organic, as in the pollen and spores studied in palynology.|$|E
25|$|Fly ash: A {{by-product}} of coal-fired electric generating plants, {{it is used}} to partially replace Portland cement (by up to 60% by mass). The properties of fly ash depend on the type of coal burnt. In general, <b>siliceous</b> fly ash is pozzolanic, while calcareous fly ash has latent hydraulic properties.|$|E
25|$|Dinocysts or dinoflagellate cysts are {{typically}} 15 to 100µm {{in diameter and}} produced by around 15–20% of living dinoflagellates as a dormant, zygotic stage of their lifecycle, which can accumulate in the sediments as microfossils. Organic-walled dinocysts are often resistant and made out of dinosporin. There are also calcareous dinoflagellate cysts and <b>siliceous</b> dinoflagellate cysts.|$|E
25|$|At {{the bottom}} of granite valleys and on the <b>siliceous</b> riverbanks, there are very typical {{formations}} of ash with Pyrenean oak, especially {{at the foot of}} thin interior mountain ranges. The sheltered gorges of the Serranía de Cuenca have mixed riparian forests of lime and hazel trees, with ashes, willows and Wych elm (Ulmus glabra).|$|E
25|$|Decomposition {{and decay}} of diatoms leads to organic and {{inorganic}} (in {{the form of}} silicates) sediment, the inorganic component of {{which can lead to}} a method of analyzing past marine environments by corings of ocean floors or bay muds, since the inorganic matter is embedded in deposition of clays and silts and forms a permanent geological record of such marine strata. (See <b>siliceous</b> ooze).|$|E
25|$|The <b>siliceous</b> {{shells of}} Collodaria are often {{preserved}} in sediment {{for millions of}} years. Micropaleontologists have utilized the fossil records of Collodaria to describe extinct species {{and the evolution of}} extant species through time using various notable features on the skeleton such as the size, number of radiate spines, and the presence of appendages. It was estimated that the lineage of Radiolarians, the ancestors of Collodaria, arose in early Paleozoic era.|$|E
25|$|Beech forests (Fagus sylvatica) {{are found}} in the {{mountain}} layer of the Iberian Eurosiberian region from 800 to 1500 metres up. The soil is cool, as often chalky as <b>siliceous</b> (rich in silica), and nearly always acidified by rain. The layer is characterised by the beech tree. The beech tree projects a deep shadow, and so its dense foliage usually excludes other woodland species. It therefore has little undergrowth.|$|E
25|$|The {{geological}} formations in the Loire {{river basin}} can be grouped into {{two sets of}} formations, namely, the basement domain and the domain of sedimentary formations. The basement domain primarily consists of metamorphic and <b>siliceous</b> fragmented rocks with groundwater occurring in fissures. The sedimentary domain consists of limestone and carbonaceous rocks, that, where saturated, form productive aquifers. Rock outcrops of granite or basalt also are exposed in the river bed in several stretches.|$|E
