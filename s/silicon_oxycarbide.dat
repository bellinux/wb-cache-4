Tetraethylortosilicate/ polydimethylsiloxane preceramic materials obtained by sol-gel process were thermally treated and attrition milled to 4 micrometers. Subsequently, the preceramic powders were pyrolized at 1100 ºC to obtain <b>silicon</b> <b>oxycarbide</b> powders that were pressed and sintered at 1550 ºC up to 16 hours. <b>Silicon</b> <b>oxycarbide</b> glasses obtained at 1100 ºC from pyrolysis of preceramic materials consist of a Si-O-C network and a carbon like graphite phase well dispersed. At annealing temperatures higher than 1100 ºC <b>silicon</b> <b>oxycarbide</b> glasses undergo a rearrangement which involves a phase separation to silica and silicon carbide and a segregation of carbon like graphite phase.

The natural grains are clearly distinct from synthetic SiC produced by various methods. Most of the natural SiC grains are 6 H and 15 R polytypes. Some of the grains (< 10 %) show extremely complex Raman spectra indicating strongly disordered structures. Some grains also show zoning in impurities, C-isotope composition and cathodoluminescence brightness. Inclusions are heterogeneously distributed within the natural SiC; their size varies from a few nanometers to hundreds of microns. The most abundant inclusions in SiC are Si metal and iron silicide (FeSi 2); a Si-C-O phase with stoichiometry close to Si 4 (C,O) 7 probably {{is related to the}} <b>silicon</b> <b>oxycarbides.</b> FeSi 2 commonly appears to have exsolved from Si metal; in some cases Ti metal then has exsolved from FeSi 2 to form symplectites. Trace elements are strongly concentrated in the inclusions of FeSi 2 and Si 4 (C,O) 7. The trace-element patterns of these phases are generally similar in the different kimberlites, but there are some consistent minor differences between localities. The trace-element patterns of FeSi 2 and Si 4 (C,O) 7 are strongly enriched in LREE/HREE and are broadly similar to the patterns of kimberlites, carbonatites and some diamond-forming fluids. However, extreme negative anoma lies in Eu (and Sm) suggest highly reducing conditions. Yb also shows strong negative anomalies in FeSi 2 from all three localities, and in Si 4 (C,O) 7 from Aikhal and Mir, but not in those from Udachnaya. Trace-element chemistry {{and the nature of the}} inclusions provide a reliable basis for distinguishing natural and synthetic SiC. Textural and chemical features and the presence of oxidation products (Si 4 (C,O) 7 and SiO 2) suggest that moissanite grew at high temperatures and elevated pressures and was subsequently partly oxidised, also at high T.

40|$|This PhD thesis {{focuses on}} the {{synthesis}} and characterization of multifunctional polymer-derived SiOCN ceramics. The main objective is to synthesize N-doped <b>silicon</b> <b>oxycarbides</b> (SiOCs), to characterize their structure and their properties (mainly electrical conductivity) and correlate them {{with the presence of}} N in the structure. We also aim to understand how the architecture of the starting polymer can influence the retention of N into the SiOC structure. First, N-doped SiOC polymer precursors were synthesized via hydrosilylation reaction between Si-H groups present in a commercial polysiloxane (PHMS) and –CH=CH 2 groups of three different commercial N-containing compounds. The structural characterization of as-synthesized preceramic polymer precursor was investigated by FT-IR and NMR. Thermal degradation was studied by TGA. The results show that the architecture of the polymer precursors plays an important role on the pyrolythic transformation. Then, SiOCN ceramics were obtained by pyrolysis of the as-synthesized polymer precursors in nitrogen atmosphere at various temperatures for 1 h using a tubular furnace. Subsequently, high temperature structural evolution was studied using combined techniques such as XRD, FT-IR, NMR, Elemental analysis, and XPS. The obtained results show that the type of N-containing compounds impacts on the crystallization behavior of the final ceramics. Elemental analysis clearly indicates that N is present in the SiOC matrix and the degree of N retention after pyrolysis is related to the type of N-containing starting compounds. XPS data indicate that N-C bonds are present in the SiOC ceramic samples even if only N-Si bonds exist in the starting N-containing precursor. However, a larger fraction of N-C bonds is present in the final SiOCN ceramic when N atoms form bonds with sp 2 carbon atoms in the pre-ceramic polymer. We have also studied electrical and optical properties of the SiOCNs. Electrical conductivity of the powdered ceramic samples was determined using powder-solution-composite technique. The results show an increase in room temperature AC conductivity of three orders of magnitude, from ≈ 10 - 5 (S/cm) to ≈ 10 - 2 (S/cm), with increasing pyrolysis temperature from 1000 to 1400 °C. Furthermore, the electrical conductivity of the SiOCN ceramic derived from N-C bond bearing precursor is three to five times higher than that of the sample derived from N-Si containing precursor at each pyrolysis temperature. The combined structural study by Raman spectroscopy and chemical analysis suggests that the increase of electrical conductivity with the pyrolysis temperature is due to the sp 3 -to-sp 2 transition of the amorphous carbon phase. The higher conductivity of the amine-derived SiOCN is also discussed considering features like the volume...|$|R

40|$|The {{principal}} {{object of}} this thesis is {{the investigation of}} <b>silicon</b> <b>oxycarbide</b> (SiOC) ceramics as anode material for Li-ion batteries. The investigated materials are prepared by cross linking commercial polymer siloxanes via hydrosylilation reactions or hybrid alkoxide precursors via sol-gel. The cross linked polymer networks are then converted in to ceramic materials by a pyrolysis process in controlled argon atmosphere at 800 - 1300 °C. In details the influence of carbon content on lithium storage properties is addressed for SiOC with the same O/Si atomic ratio of about 1. Detailed structural characterization studies are performed using complementary techniques which aim correlating the electrochemical behavior with the microstructure of the SiOC anodes. Results suggest that SiOC anodes behave as a composite material consisting of a disordered <b>silicon</b> <b>oxycarbide</b> phase having a very high first insertion capacity of ca 1300 mAh g- 1 and a free C phase. However, the charge irreversibly trapped into the amorphous <b>silicon</b> <b>oxycarbide</b> network is also high. In consequence the maximum reversible lithium storage capacity of 650 mAh g- 1 is measured on high-C content SiOCs with the ratio between amorphous <b>silicon</b> <b>oxycarbide</b> and the free C phase of  1 : 1. The high carbon content SiOC shows also an excellent cycling stability and performance at high charging/discharging rate with the stable capacity at 2 C rate being around 200 mAh g- 1. Increasing the pyrolysis temperature has an opposite effect on the low-C and high-C materials: for the latter one the reversible capacity decreases following a known trend while the former shows an increase of xi the reversible capacity which has never been observed before for similar materials. The influence of pyrolysis atmosphere on lithium storage capacity is investigated as well. It is found that pyrolysis in Ar/H 2 mixtures, compared to the treatment under pure Ar, results into a decrease of the concentration of C dangling bonds as revealed by electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements. The sample prepared under Ar/H 2 mixture shows an excellent cycling stability {{with an increase in}} the specific capacity of about 150 mAh g- 1 compared to its analogues pyrolysed in pure argon atmosphere. In order to study the role of porosity towards the lithium storage properties, a comparison of dense and porous materials obtained using same starting precursors is made. Porous SiOC ceramics are prepared by HF etching of the SiOC ceramics. HF etching removes a part of the amorphous silica phase from SiOC nanostructure leaving a porous structure. Porous ceramics with surface areas up to 640 m 2 g- 1 is obtained. The electrochemical charging/discharging results indicate that the porosity can help to increase the lithium storage capacity and it also leads to an enhanced cycling stability.

It also addresses {{the changes in}} susceptibility to oxidation due to variations {{in the distribution of}} Si bonded species obtained under different processing conditions. The study is carried out using Si- 29 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and a design of experiments approach to model the oxidation behavior. The NMR results are compared with those obtained by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Samples pyrolyzed under inert conditions are compared to those pyrolyzed in reactive ammonia environments...|$|E
40|$|Single {{crystalline}} {{silicon carbide}} nanowires (SiCNWs) growing along 〈 111 〉 direction were synthesized on a carbon nanotube (CNT) template. A powder mixture of silicon monoxide (SiO) and iron (II) phthalocyanine, FeCNH, (FePc) was mechanically ball milled {{and followed by}} thermal annealing at 1200 °C for 1 hour. Multiwalled CNTs were first produced via pyrolysis of FePc at a lower temperature (1000 °C). SiO vapors reacted with the CNTs at higher temperature (1200 °C) to produce SiCNWs. The mechanical ball milling process {{plays an important role}} for the formation of cylindrical CNTs and SiCNWs. Without this ball milling process, the end products were amorphous <b>silicon</b> <b>oxycarbide</b> nanowires (SiOCNWs) even using the same starting materials under the same annealing conditions...|$|E
40|$|<b>Silicon</b> <b>oxycarbide</b> (SiOC) ceramic foams, {{produced}} by the pyrolysis of a foamed blend of a methylsilicone preceramic polymer and polyurethane (PU) in a 1 / 1 wt. % ratio, exhibit excellent physical and mechanical properties. The proposed process allows to easily modify the density and morphology of the foams, making them suitable for several engineering applications. However, {{it has been shown}} that, due to residual carbon present in the oxycarbide phase after pyrolysis, the foams are subjected to an oxidation process that reduces their strength after high temperature exposure to air (12 h 1200 C). A modified process, imploying the same silicone resin preceramic polymer but a much lower PU content (silicone resin/PU= 5. 25 / 1 wt. % ratio), has been developed and is reported in this paper. Microstructural investigations showed that carbon rich regions deriving from the decomposition of the polyurethane template are still present in the SiOC foam, but have a much smaller dimension than those found in foams with a higher PU content. Thermal gravimetric studies performed in air or oxygen showed that the low-PU containing ceramic foams display an excellent oxidation resistance, because the carbon-rich areas are embedded inside the struts or cell walls and are thus protected by the dense <b>silicon</b> <b>oxycarbide</b> matrix surrounding them. SiOC foams obtained with the novel process are capable to maintain their mechanical strength after oxidation treatments at 800 and 1200 C (12 h), while SiOC foams obtained with a higher amount of PU show about a 30 % strength decrease after oxidation at 1200 C (12 h). # 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|A silicon-containing graft copolymer, poly(dimethylsiloxane) -graft-polyacrylates, was {{explored}} as single-source precursor for {{the preparation}} of <b>silicon</b> <b>oxycarbide</b> (SiOC) with honeycomb microstructures by a novel reliable approach composed of breath figure (BF) process, plasma modification and pyrolysis. Multilayer ordered porous films prepared by a static BF process were treated by oxygen plasma at room temperature, and used as templates for in situ formation of honeycomb microstructured SiOC sheets by further pyrolysis. Plasma modification is believed to {{play a key role}} in templating the formation of patterned SiOC sheets because no special features were found when pyrolysing the unmodified films. The formed sheets possess a nanometer-thickness top layer with an average pore diameter of 1. 893 £gm. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{chemical}} interaction during interface formation between Pd and SiC, Pd layers of various thicknesses were deposited on structurally disordered SiC surfaces at 800 °C. The Pd/SiC interface, which {{plays a crucial role}} for many applications such as high power electronic devices and tristructural-isotropic (TRISO) nuclear fuels, was studied in situ by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. We find that after Pd deposition, Si-C and Si-Si bonds are broken in favor of the formation of not only Pd-Si but also Pd-bonds. In addition, various <b>silicon</b> <b>oxycarbide</b> bonds are observed at the SiC surface and the Pd/SiC interface. These results are not only of relevance for the long-term stability of TRISO fuels but also for a variety of other applications, including Schottky-barrier-type contacts in electronic devices...|$|E
