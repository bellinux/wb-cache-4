5|$|The structuralist {{movement}} originated {{primarily from}} the work of Durkheim as interpreted by two European anthropologists. Anthony Giddens' theory of <b>structuration</b> draws on the linguistic theory of Ferdinand de Saussure and the French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss. In this context, 'structure' refers not to 'social structure' but to the semiotic understanding of human culture as a system of signs. One may delineate four central tenets of structuralism: First, structure is what determines the structure of a whole. Second, structuralists believe that every system has a structure. Third, structuralists are interested in 'structural' laws that deal with coexistence rather than changes. Finally, structures are the 'real things' beneath the surface or the appearance of meaning.|$|E

In this way, <b>structuration</b> theory prioritizes ontology over epistemology. In his own work, Giddens focuses on production and reproduction of social practices in some context. He looked for stasis and change, agent expectations, relative degrees of routine, tradition, behavior, and creative, skillful, and strategic thought simultaneously. He examined spatial organization, intended and unintended consequences, skilled and knowledgeable agents, discursive and tacit knowledge, dialectic of control, actions with motivational content, and constraints. <b>Structuration</b> theorists conduct analytical research of social relations, rather than organically discovering them, since they use <b>structuration</b> theory to reveal specific research questions, though that technique has been criticized as cherry-picking.|$|E

40|$|This thesis studies youth from {{different}} perspectives. These are the life phaseand the generational perspectives, {{which have been}} studied via questions of establishment and individualisation. The main question is whether young people are different {{because they have not}} made socially important transitions into adulthood or if they are different because they have grown up under different circumstances than earlier generations. The consequences of the outcome are important because they can indicate what kind of society young people will reproduce. The following conclusions are drawn: First, there are clear effects of social <b>structurations</b> (class of origin and gender) in the lives of young people. They affect the distribution of attitudes towards welfare state expenditures as well as the economic effects in a long-term perspective. Second, there is rather weak importance of role transitions in relation to what young people believe is important for adulthood, role transitions’ importance for the distribution of attitudes towards the welfare state as well as role transitions’ importance in a long-term perspective. Third, increasing age and subtle socialisation processes may be an explanation to the rather weak meaning of role transitions, cause adjustments to surrounding contexts and people’s expectations. It is concluded that the life phase perspective is a more accurate way of viewing young people, mainly because of the impact of social <b>structurations,</b> which are believed to contribute to continuous reproduction rather than complete change of society...|$|R

Interrogating processes of ‘choosing to trust’, the authors describe various mechanisms through which ‘decisions’ are constrained while emphasising enduring agency to (dis) trust, even amid contexts where choice would appear annihilated by patients’ vulnerability. Drawing initially on Greener, Luhmann and Giddens, the article develops an analysis of how features of vulnerability, time and consciousness function in bounding choices and trust.

40|$|Abstract: This article aims to {{understand}} how the politics of alterity in Japan led to a misdirected understanding of the West during the early Tokugawa period and the interwar periods. By means of two specific narrative matrices shinkoku [land of the gods] and kokutai [national polity essence], conceptual frameworks that operate with powerful begetting capabilities, it is shown how parallel <b>structurations</b> are at work in two distinct, but decisive, confrontations with the West. Shinkoku and kokutai discourses were specific self-understandings/representations promoted by ruling elites, which combined internal and external elements, and which devel-oped the notion of a group and a related process of identification. Originating in medieval times, the shinkoku discourse was used during the early modern period to confront alternative self-understandings/representations, perceived as seditious and pernicious; in particular, Christianity. Within the country, shinkoku discourse contributed to the design of the Tokugawa’s knowledge and moral spaces, in which a Japanese national identity was to be situated.

[...] Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock instead called them mainstream films with transgressive elements.

Ernest Mathijs focused on the accidental nature of cult followings, arguing that cult film fans consider themselves too savvy to be marketed to, while Jonathan Rosenbaum rejected the continued existence of cult films and called the term a marketing buzzword. [...] Mathijs suggests that cult films help to understand ambiguity and incompleteness in life given the difficulty in even defining the term. [...] That cult films can have opposing qualities – such as good and bad, failure and success, innovative and retro – helps to illustrate that art is subjective and never self-evident. [...] This ambiguity leads critics of postmodernism to accuse cult films of being beyond criticism, as the emphasis is now on personal interpretation rather than critical analysis or metanarratives.

Six hydrogels (Mn-LG, Mn-HG, Co-LG, Co-HG, Cu-LG and Cu-HG) were synthesized and studied by spectromechanical analyses. On one hand, Cu-HG, Cu-LG and Co-HG behaved as viscoelastic solids: the elastic contribution was higher than the dissipative component in all the frequency range studied (G'> G''). No flow zone (G''> G') was detected even at very low values of the shearing frequency. On the other, Mn-HG, Mn-LG and Co-LG presented a spectromechanical behavior that resembled that observed classically for entangled polymers. Indeed, at high frequency, these latter materials could be compared to a viscoelastic solid but at low frequency, the flow zone was described and the viscous character became prevalent with finite relaxation time.

Residue at position 8 plays a major role in initiating the folding, while position 12 is not critical. Conformational stability has no major impact on antimicrobial efficacy. However, preformed beta-hairpin in solution may act as a conformational lock that prevents switch to alpha-helical structure.

40|$|Peak oil has {{acquired}} {{prominence in the}} political lexicon of {{an increasing number of}} critical and radical perspectives during the ongoing ecological and economic crisis. By examining examples within academia as well as initiatives such as the Degrowth Movement and the Transition Network, this paper documents how a series of red-green discourses and movements mobilise the narrative of peak oil as an alarm bell that signals the inevitability of the present ecological crises and of the coming collapse of the fossil-fuel economy. The paper, developing an analysis on two levels, argues that the ‘red-green’ mobilisation of peak oil is problematic. First, a close reading of red-green discourses shows how the weaknesses of the narrative highlighted in the literature (such as a naturalising and de-politicising understanding of the materiality and finitude of oil) are reproduced by the red-greens. Second, building on discourse and political theory, the paper highlights that red-green interpellations of peak oil fail to transcend hegemonic discursive <b>structurations</b> in the field of environmental and energy security, where geopolitical apocalyptic imaginaries and biopolitical forms of securitisation are linked in reproducing post-politicisation processes.

The peculiarities of the conceptual interpretations of the consumerism phenomena in the contemporary theoretical sociology is investigated. The cognitive significance of these interpretations for development of advanced surveys in sociology under the modern conditions of the global and regional transformations is underlined by the author. The consumerism phenomena is defined as ontological foundation for elaboration of the "consumer society" sociological theories. The concept of "consumer society" is interpretated by scholars in different ways: 1) as a specific essential component of industrial social system; 2) as the type of the developed part of the world capitalist system; 3) as the latest phase of the historical development of the post-industrial societies in which the sphere of consumption determines all processes of <b>structurations</b> and social changes. In the sociological theories of global modernization consumerism is interpretated as economic phenomena. This theory defines consumerism as a social movement as an important factor of economic growth. In the sociological theories of global dependency and in the radical theories of post-modern sociology consumerism presented as cultural-ideological phenomena which is oriented to protection of the manipulative over-consumption model.

40|$|The {{research}} project poses the question: {{what are the}} polar <b>structurations</b> of a system after unipolar transitions, and should a system transition into a nonpolar structure, how can this phenomenon be explained? In the study of polarity, two deficiencies are diagnosed that can potentially not only fill a serious gap, but also strengthen the theoretical, conceptual, and systemic tools utilized within the field. The first gap {{is the absence of}} any developed treatments of nonpolarity. Categorical taxonomy primarily revolves around uni-, bi-, tri-, or multi- polar structures. The field lacks a coherent conceptualization of nonpolarity, thus limiting the development of a robust theoretical model that can enrich the study of polar structures and world powers. The second deficiency is the shortage of systematized studies of structural transformations, especially the outcome of polar structural transitions after unipolarity. The objective of this research is to conceptualize, test, and analyze the power configurations and post transitional patters within world political systems. The intent is to observe what power configuration unipolar systems transition into, gauge probabilistic outcomes, and if the ensuing power configuration is defined by nonpolarity, address whether a discernible pattern may be ascertained vis-à-vis unipolarity giving way to nonpolarity.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{can be read}} on {{at least}} two levels. On one level it will deal with- how general patterns of cognitive perception set frames for and affect human action in history and how these patterns may change. A study on copper flat axes will serve as a foundation for this discussion. This examination of copper flat axes will, however, at the same time examplify some of the problems concerning archaeological artifact analysis, for example typology. These problems describe another level of this dissertation, which presents and discusses some reflections considering archaeological artifact analysis, and how perception influences our observations and interpretations. The focus of this dissertation is thus set on perception, but the phenomenon of perception is encountered from two differing angles; one general perspective is set on perception and historical change, while the other is set on how perception conditions analytical reasoning in archaeology. The <b>structurations</b> of individual trajectories are suggested as being of central importance for setting the frames for rationality. Changing patterns of trajectories can therefore come to transform the general understanding of things. The reason and the understanding of the world are with other words created through communication. The reason and understanding of the world can come to differ between persons with different patterns of trajectories. It is claimed in this dissertation that the relationships between communication, individual trajectories, reason and ideology have been of large importance for the transformations of cultural discourse in history...|$|R

The author gives an extension to precedent publications (published in the present journal : Langages).

The author uses differents relational semantic primitives, spatio-temporal and intentional primitives, as : to localize, to move, to change, to do, to control, to anticipate [...] ., to construct different semantico-cognitive schemes. These schemes (stative and dynamic schemes) represent the meanings of lexical predicates. The primitives and schemes are elements of a cognitive representation level. With the relational semantic primitives it is possible to organize grammatical continua (as agentivity, passivity, aspectuality, transitivity, diathesis). The schemes are also integrated into predicative relations by means of specific operators (combinators) of combinatory logic; these predicative relations express different places of arguments and casual relations. Some schemes are not specific to typologie group of languages but are invariants : for instance the scheme of transitive active diathesis is a dynamic scheme which is related to the scheme of ergativity and to the schemes of active/inactive languages.

In Lithuania, a former Soviet bloc country undergoing a complex transition, an urge from various societal groups for successful and adequate policies exemplify {{the importance of this}} linkage. The study inquires into its establishment during the transition from the Soviet to the EU by exploring collective action to assist Lithuanian SMEs -a new group of economic actors -with their transition period needs. Policy linkage is operationalised in terms of successful and adequate policies. Methodologically, the study examines the usefulness of bottom-up approach to policy organising for revealing policy process in the transition context. Theoretically, the study tests the explanatory power of the major bottom-up assumptions regarding the preconditions for policy linkage in the Lithuanian transition. Especially the role of the government and formal politicaladministrative institutions is explored. The study findings indicate very limited government, EU and mandated actors’ success in organising adequate SME assistance policies. Ad hoc collective actions with mixed types of actors and alternative <b>structurations</b> were found to frequently supplement for the policy linkage. Useful explanations to this were provided by the employed context, structural and behavioural factors. Active selforganising of policy receivers was a precondition significantly increasing the adequacy of the collective assistance action. Also adherence {{to the rule of law}} principles in policy process should not be undermined to increase chances of policy adequacy. Especially a combination of behavioural factors characteristic of social capital in the localities studied was found important to consider further.

However, the Triassic section is under-explored and its potential is not well known. As a first approach the oil companies will explore near or under already existing fields because it is considered relatively cheap exploration due to the infrastructure in place. The basis for this semi-regional seismic interpretation study was generated from a geological background study of the Hammerfest Basin. The tectonical and paleogeographical history has been described with emphasis on the Triassic period. In addition the petroleum systems were investigated and especially the Tornerose area due to discoveries in the Triassic section. The main seismic interpretation was carried out on areas neighboring the Snøhvit and Albatross Fields on the survey ST 0306. Three key seismic horizons in the Triassic were chosen for the interpretation; Top Snadd, Top Kobbe and Top Klappmyss. After horizon interpretation and gridding several layered attribute maps were generated. With these maps many channels and sand bodies were mapped around the Snøhvit and Albatross Fields. Unfortunately the channels are smaller here than on Tornerose, but most of the sand bodies are very interesting regarding the size and also the location. For the Triassic section in the Hammerfest Basin a fully functional petroleum system is most likely in place, but some uncertainties regarding for instance the reservoir quality and the lack of <b>structurations</b> in the Kobbe Formation and also the possible paleographical distal placement of the Triassic part of the Snøhvit area. However, the paleogrographical map is a big uncertainty itself and some studies indicate that the coastline should be shifted westwards, placing the Snøhvit area in a better position regarding the reservoir quality and thickness. The conclusion from this interpretation study is that there has to be done further investigations before the petroleum potential is fully established, and the target area could also be expanded further. </p...|$|R
