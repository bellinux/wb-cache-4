5000|$|To yield 7.5 image frames per second, {{the disk}} must spin at 450 rpm. A {{household}} fan motor revolves the disc. An external, variable resistor controls the motor speed. The {{man on the}} cover is adjusting scanning wheel speed with a 125-hertz tuning fork. He looks through the vibrating tuning fork at the line pattern on the hub. A stationary pattern indicates that the wheel has arrived at 450 RPM. The proper speed isn't the only requirement. The receiver disk must also match the angular position of the TV station's <b>scanner</b> <b>disk.</b> Until both disks align, the viewer presses a button that momentarily boosts the receiving disk speed. (Note: Most mechanical TV stations used scanners instead of cameras {{to pick up the}} talent.) ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Disk</b> <b>scanners</b> share a major {{limitation}} {{with the}} Farnsworth image dissector. Light is conveyed into the sensing system as the small aperture scans {{over the entire}} field of view. The actual amount of light gathered is instantaneous, occurring through a very small aperture, and the net yield is only a microscopic percentage of the incident energy.|$|R

The player can choose {{from a wide variety of}} weapons and gadgets, including pistols and automatic weapons. On select missions they are given the explosive gum and the Facemaker from the movie. They are also given explosives to set on targets. Other equipment Ethan is provided with includes smoke generators, infra-red contacts, gas injectors, fingerprint <b>scanners,</b> and computer <b>disks.</b>|$|R
30|$|To {{guide image}} fusion of the SPECT with the micro-CT, two acrylic {{circular}} disks containing 3 3.7  MBq 57 Co point sources incorporated in organic ion exchange beads of 1 -mm diameter (Canberra, Zellik, Belgium) were firmly {{fixed to the}} <b>scanner</b> bed. The <b>disks</b> measured 25  mm in diameter and 3  mm in thickness. The six beads provided reference points in both imaging modalities and were used as markers to generate a spatial transformation matrix. The spatial position of the six fiducial markers was determined manually using A Medical Image Data Examiner (AMIDE).|$|R

In a typical example, a socket on a {{computer}} motherboard would have {{one end of a}} cable plugged into it, while {{the other end of the}} cable plugged into a disk drive or other device. Some cables have different types of connectors on them, and some cables can have as many as 16 connectors (allowing 16 devices to be wired together). Different types of connectors may be used for devices inside a computer cabinet, than for external devices such as <b>scanners</b> or external <b>disk</b> drives.|$|R
50|$|<b>Scanner</b> is a <b>disk</b> space {{analyzing}} {{and management}} tool for Microsoft Windows operating systems. It displays the disk space usage of any drive or directory {{in the form}} of a multilevel pie chart which can be navigated up and down through the directory tree. When the mouse cursor is placed above a pie the program displays which directory the pie represents, how many files it contains and the overall disk space occupied by it. A context menu allows to open the directory inside the Windows Explorer, hide and un-hide it from the diagram as well as deleting the pie from the disk either via the Recycle Bin or permanently.|$|R
25|$|Baird {{performed}} one of {{the earliest}} public demonstrations of color television system on 3 July 1928 using an all-mechanical system with three Nipkow <b>disk</b> <b>scanners</b> synchronized with a single disk on the receiving end and three colored lights that were turned on and off in synchronicity with the broadcaster. The same basic system was used on 4 February 1938 to create the first color broadcast transmissions from The Crystal Palace to the Dominion Theatre in London. Baird {{was not the only one}} to experiment with mechanical color television, and a number of similar devices were demonstrated throughout this period, but Baird is recorded as the first to show a real over-the-air transmission in a public demonstration.|$|R

By 1927, Takayanagi improved the resolution to 100 lines, which was unrivaled until 1931. By 1928, {{he was the first to}} transmit human faces in halftones. His work had an influence on the later work of Vladimir K. Zworykin. By 1935, Takayanagi had invented the first all-electronic television. His research toward creating a production model was halted by the US after Japan lost World War II.|$|R

40|$|MiAlbum © (v 1. 0) is {{a system}} {{developed}} at Microsoft Research China for managing family photos {{with the help of}} a semi-automatic image annotation approach. It provides functionalities to import (from <b>scanner,</b> digital camera, <b>disks,</b> PC, CD, web, etc.), label (keywords, name, place, etc.), index, browse, and search (by several means), categorize (by automatic classification into some predefined classes), manipulate (in some ways), and export (send or print) family photo images. In this demo, we show the efficiency of the semi-automatic image annotation method and its help in improving the image retrieval accuracy. As a large number of family photos and other images of personal use have been accumulated, management tasks, including search, browse, and classification of these images are severe problems encountered by the users.

5000|$|In 1928, WRGB, then W2XB, {{was started}} as the world's first {{television}} station. It broadcast from the General Electric facility in Schenectady, NY. It was {{popularly known as}} [...] "WGY Television". Meanwhile, in the Soviet Union, Léon Theremin had been developing a mirror drum-based television, starting with 16 lines resolution in 1925, then 32 lines and eventually 64 using interlacing in 1926. As part of his thesis, on 7 May 1926, he electrically transmitted, and then projected, near-simultaneous moving images on a five-foot square screen. By 1927 he achieved an image of 100 lines, a resolution that was not surpassed until May 1932 by RCA, with 120 lines. On 25 December 1926, Kenjiro Takayanagi demonstrated a television system with a 40-line resolution that employed a Nipkow <b>disk</b> <b>scanner</b> and CRT display at Hamamatsu Industrial High School in Japan. This prototype is still {{on display at the}} Takayanagi Memorial Museum in Shizuoka University, Hamamatsu Campus.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} ephemera {{is a key}} {{instrument}} of cultural memory, marking the things intended to be forgotten. This important role means that when ephemera survives, whether accidentally or deliberately, it does so despite itself. These survivals, because they evoke all those other objects that have necessarily been forgotten, {{can be described as}} uncanny. The paper is divided into three main sections. The first situates ephemera within an uncanny economy of memory and forgetting. The second focuses on ephemera at a particular historical moment, the industrialization of print in the nineteenth century. This section considers the liminal place of newspapers and periodicals in this period, positioned as both provisional media for information as well as objects of record. The third section introduces a new configuration of technologies – <b>scanners,</b> computers, hard <b>disks,</b> monitors, the various connections between them – and considers the conditions under which born-digital ephemera can linger and return. Through this analysis, the paper concludes by considering digital technologies as an apparatus of memory, setting out what is required if we are not to be doubly haunted by the printed ephemera within the digital archive...|$|R
