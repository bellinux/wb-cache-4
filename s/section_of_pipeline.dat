5000|$|During World War Two {{to protect}} the {{pipeline}} from damage or look for possible leaks, a team {{of men and women}} was employed to patrol the pipeline. Each person was responsible for a <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipeline</b> eight to ten miles long. [...] This was clearly very manpower intensive and later it was possible to use commercial not RAF helicopters to patrol the pipelines on a fortnightly basis and helicopter landing pads were constructed on the depots. In the 1950s a means of preventing pipeline corrosion known as cathodic protection became available. This method utilises an electric current to the pipeline such that the natural electrical action which takes place between pipe and soil leading to corrosion is reversed. Cathodic protection was applied to the pipeline system on a rolling programme which started in 1954 and was completed in 1970.|$|E

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{for determining the}} wall condition of water pipelines, by using an inverse transient model to interpret the measured response of the pipeline to deliberately induced controlled transients is presented. Changes in pipe wall lining and thickness theoretically give rise to reflections in measured transient responses and these can be interpreted to assess pipeline wall condition. The results of field tests on a 750 mm diameter pipeline, containing reflections from a damaged <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipeline,</b> are presented. A distribution of known damage (determined from CCTV camera footage) and inferred damage is characterised in terms of four categories of wall deterioration. This distribution of damage is then included in a transient model of the pipeline and the measured and predicted reflection response are found to compare favourably. The transient model is then combined with a Genetic Algorithm and inverse transient analysis is performed using transient data generated from a distribution of known, inferred and arbitrary damage. The inverse transient analysis relatively accurately predicts the pre-determined distribution of damage along the pipeline. M. L. Stephens, A. R. Simpson and M. F. Lamber...|$|E

The Ahvaz-Marun pipeline was about 34 -km and carries Ethan gas from Marun Petrochemical Company (MPC) to Ahvaz. A model was developed incorporating pipeline length, topography, geology, land use, stream, wetland, road and a railroad crossings to identify a least cost pathway.
