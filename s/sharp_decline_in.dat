5|$|From 1810 to 1820, {{the number}} of free blacks in Indiana {{increased}} from 400 to 1200. In 1820 the State Supreme Court case of Polly v. Lasselle ordered all slaves, except those held before the 1787 Northwest Territory Ordinance, to be freed. The new ruling led to a <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> the state's slave population. In 1820 the census recorded 190 slaves; by the 1830 census there were only three.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the {{government}} pressed ahead with its Fast Track Land Reform programme, a policy involving compulsory land acquisition aimed at redistributing {{land from the}} minority white population to the majority black population. Confiscations of white farmland, continuous droughts, and a serious drop in external finance and other supports led to a <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> agricultural exports, which were traditionally the country's leading export-producing sector. Some 58,000 independent black farmers have since experienced limited success in reviving the gutted cash crop sectors through efforts on a smaller scale.|$|E
5|$|In her {{biography}} of McCracken, The Girl Who Fell Down, dance critic Mary Jo Sagolla says that McCracken is little remembered today, and not widely appreciated for her influence on Fosse, {{and for her}} efforts to encourage him to move from dance to choreography. Though her career went into a <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> the 1950s due to her diabetes, she directly influenced the career of MacLaine, as well as Fosse, and was a pioneer in combining comedy and dance.|$|E

5|$|It {{appears that}} {{predation}} by invasive mammalian species including ship rats, cats, and mustelids was an additional {{factor in the}} decline in huia numbers – introduction of these animals by New Zealand acclimatisation societies peaked in the 1880s and coincided with a particularly <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> huia populations. Because it {{spent a lot of}} time on the ground, the huia would have been particularly vulnerable to mammalian predators. Another hypothetical cause of extinction is exotic parasites and disease introduced from Asia with the common myna.|$|E
5|$|The first {{infrared}} {{observations were}} published in 1998, in which both near and far infrared spectroscopy data was presented. The collected data showed Sakurai's Object's steep brightening in 1996, followed by a <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> 1999 as expected. It was later found that the Star's steep decline in light {{was due to the}} circumstellar dust located around the star, which was present at a temperature of ~680 K. Further infrared data recorded by the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope was published in 2000, in which findings of the changing absorption lines were discussed.|$|E
5|$|The thirteenth {{and final}} {{season of the}} Australian police drama Blue Heelers premiered on the Seven Network on 1 April 2006 and aired on Saturday nights at 8:30 pm. The 11-episode season {{concluded}} 4 June 2006, due to its cancellation by the Seven Network {{as a result of}} its <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> ratings. When, in late 2005, the time came to renew Blue Heelers, Seven commissioned eleven further episodes to be produced, but its future after this was still undecided.|$|E

50|$|After the Spanish {{conquest of}} Mexico in 1521, the Spaniards' {{destruction}} of the dams and sluice gates in the 1520s, {{as well as the}} <b>sharp</b> <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> the native population, led to the near abandonment of the Chinampa gardens.|$|R
5|$|This period saw a {{political}} alignment with the Eastern Bloc countries and a shift toward economic insularity. These policies, coupled with economic pressures {{stemming from the}} 1973 oil crisis, resulted in the rapid collapse of Madagascar's economy and a <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> living standards, and the country had become completely bankrupt by 1979. The Ratsiraka administration accepted the conditions of transparency, anti-corruption measures and free market policies imposed by the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and various bilateral donors {{in exchange for their}} bailout of the nation's broken economy.|$|E
5|$|Cairano was {{undoubtedly}} {{affected by this}} period of sudden and profound decay, if {{only because of the}} <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> commissions. After a decade of intense activity with several overlapping projects, a new stage in his career began, one which is obscured from the documentary view. The last relevant document in this regard is the contract for the entrance to the Duomo of Chiari in 1513, while the next document, in 1517, states that Cairano was already dead. Apart from this, there are other works from the period attributed to him, including the complex question of the completion of the Martinengo mausoleum.|$|E
5|$|Replacement {{pilots were}} pushed through an {{abbreviated}} training regimen {{in order to}} meet the short-term needs of the fleet. This led to a <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> the quality of the aviators produced. These inexperienced pilots were fed into front-line units, while the veterans who remained after Midway and the Solomons campaign were forced to share an increased workload as conditions grew more desperate, with few being given a chance to rest in rear areas or in the home islands. As a result, Japanese naval air groups as a whole progressively deteriorated during the war while their American adversaries continued to improve.|$|E
50|$|The {{prognosis}} of Alzheimer's disease also differs {{between men}} and women. Though women tend to experience a much <b>sharper</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> grey matter {{at the onset of}} the disease, men catch up and eventually overtake women in grey matter loss as the disease progresses.|$|R
25|$|Critics have {{suggested}} that the complexity inherent in securitization can limit investors' ability to monitor risk, and that competitive securitization markets with multiple securitizers may be particularly prone to <b>sharp</b> <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> underwriting standards.

The losses sustained also helped create a general anger among investors.|$|R
5|$|The Citra Awards, {{then known}} as the Indonesian Film Festival Awards, were first given at the IFF in early 1955; that year's Best Supporting Actress was Endang Kusdiningsih {{for her role in}} Tarmina. Succeeding festivals were held in 1960 and 1967. From 1973 the IFF was held annually. This {{continued}} uninterrupted until after the 1992 IFF, when a <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> film production led the festival to be discontinued. It was reinstated as an annual event in 2004, after receiving funds from the Indonesian government. The most recent winner is Raihaanun, who won a Citra Award at the 2016 IFF for her acting in Salawaku.|$|E
5|$|The {{installation}} of dams dramatically altered {{the landscape and}} ecosystem of the river. At one time, the Columbia {{was one of the}} top salmon-producing river systems in the world. Previously active fishing sites, such as Celilo Falls in the eastern Columbia River Gorge, have exhibited a <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> fishing along the Columbia in the last century, and salmon populations have been dramatically reduced. Fish ladders have been installed at some dam sites to help the fish journey to spawning waters. Chief Joseph Dam has no fish ladders and completely blocks fish migration to the upper half of the Columbia River system.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{stoppages}} across the UK peaked at 4,583 in 1979, {{when more than}} 29million working days had been lost. In 1984, {{the year of the}} miners' strike, there were 1,221, resulting in the loss of more than 27million working days. Stoppages then fell steadily throughout the rest of Thatcher's premiership; in 1990 there were 630 and fewer than 2million working days lost, and they continued to fall thereafter. Thatcher's tenure also witnessed a <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> trade union density, with the percentage of workers belonging to a trade union falling from 57.3% in 1979 to 49.5% in 1985. In 1979 up until Thatcher's final year in office, trade union membership also fell, from 13.5million in 1979 to fewer than 10million.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} if recent <b>sharp</b> <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> {{the price}} of oil and other fossil fuels will discourage private investment in renewable energy, which is key for climate change mitigation. The increase in private renewables investment in the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region have been driven by <b>sharp</b> <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> costs alongside supportive policies. The sharp fall in {{the price of}} oil and other fossil fuels since 2014 risks disrupting continued private investment in renewables if they becomes insufficiently profitable. The <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> oil and other fossil fuel prices presents an opportunity for governments to reduce subsidies to them. For countries without such large subsidies, governments could increase taxes on them. This would alleviate their negative effects on climate change. Abstract. [...] Introduction. [...] I.

States such as Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Mizoram and Andaman and Nicobar Islands recorded an increase in child sex ratio. National child sex ratio has declined from 927 in 2001 to 914 in 2011. Telangana census was separated from Andhra Pradesh state census figures, after Telangana formally took birth on 2 June 2014.|$|E
5|$|Dhaka {{suffered}} stagnation {{and decline}} began during the mid 19th-century. Its muslin industry {{was destroyed by}} high colonial taxation, restriction of trade and forced imports of British manufactured textiles. The city's weavers starved to death during Bengal famines. The rise of the colonial capital Calcutta caused a <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> the city's population. Dhaka became heavily impoverished. In 1824, an Anglican bishop described Dhaka as a city of magnificent ruins. During the mutiny of 1857, the city witnessed revolts by the Bengal Army. The British Indian rule was established following the mutiny. It bestowed privileges on the Dhaka Nawab Family, which dominated the city's political and social elite. The Dhaka Cantonment was established {{as a base for}} the British Indian Army. The British developed the modern city around Ramna, Shahbag Garden and Bahadur Shah Park. A modern civic water system was introduced in 1874. The electricity supply began in 1901.|$|E
5|$|Edwin's {{defeat and}} death caused his kingdom to {{fragment}} into {{at least two}} parts. It also led to a <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> Christianity in Northumbria when Edwin's immediate successors reverted to paganism. Although Paulinus' deacon, James, remained {{in the north and}} struggled to rebuild the Roman mission, Edwin's widow decided to return to Kent. Paulinus went with her, taking Edwin and Æthelburg's son and daughter, as well as one of Edwin's grandsons. The two boys went to the continent for safety, to the court of King Dagobert I. Æthelburg, Eanflæd, and Paulinus remained in Kent, where Paulinus was offered the see, or bishopric, of Rochester, which he held until his death. Because the pallium did not reach Paulinus until after he had left York, it was of no use to him.|$|E

5|$|Forms of {{traditional}} football have been played throughout Europe and beyond since antiquity. Many of these involved {{handling of the}} ball, and scrummage-like formations. These archaic forms of football, typically classified as mob football, would be played between neighboring towns and villages, involving an unlimited number of players on opposing teams, who would clash in a heaving mass of people struggling to drag an inflated pig's bladder by any means possible to markers {{at each end of}} a town. By some accounts, in some such events any means could be used to move the ball towards the goal, as long as it did not lead to manslaughter or murder. These antiquated games went into <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> the 19th century when the Highway Act 1835 was passed banning the playing of football on public highways.|$|E
5|$|If {{the patient}} {{presents}} {{less than eight}} hours after paracetamol overdose, then acetylcysteine significantly {{reduces the risk of}} serious hepatotoxicity and guarantees survival. If acetylcysteine is started more than 8hours after ingestion, there is a <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> its effectiveness because the cascade of toxic events in the liver has already begun, and the risk of acute liver necrosis and death increases dramatically. Although acetylcysteine is most effective if given early, it still has beneficial effects if given as late as 48hours after ingestion. In clinical practice, if the patient presents more than eight hours after the paracetamol overdose, then activated charcoal is not useful, and acetylcysteine is started immediately. In earlier presentations, charcoal can be given when the patient arrives and acetylcysteine is initiated while waiting for the paracetamol level results to return from the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|In 1830 the new railway {{opened and}} by the end of the year was {{carrying}} freight. Bradshaw immediately went into competition by lowering the rates of carriage on the canal and by offering improved terms to the private carriers. By so doing he managed to maintain the volume of traffic carried by the canal, both freight and passengers, at a time when the country was suffering a trade depression. However Bradshaw's tactics led to a <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> profits. At the same time costs were rising, partly due to the use of steamboats on the Mersey. Further competition came with the opening of the Macclesfield Canal in 1831 which gave separate access to Manchester from the Midlands. In November 1831 Bradshaw suffered a stroke, as a result of which he lost the use of his left arm and leg, and there is evidence that it also impaired his judgement.|$|E
50|$|Because of the <b>sharp</b> <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> the U.S. coal industry, the Harvard Business Review {{discussed}} retraining coal {{workers for}} solar photovoltaic employment {{because of the}} rapid rise in U.S. solar jobs.
