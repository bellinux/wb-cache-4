5|$|Laminar {{boundary}} layers can be loosely classified {{according to}} their structure and {{the circumstances under which}} they are created. The thin <b>shear</b> <b>layer</b> which develops on an oscillating body {{is an example of a}} Stokes boundary layer, while the Blasius boundary layer refers to the well-known similarity solution near an attached flat plate held in an oncoming unidirectional flow and Falkner–Skan boundary layer, a generalization of Blasius profile. When a fluid rotates and viscous forces are balanced by the Coriolis effect (rather than convective inertia), an Ekman layer forms. In the theory of heat transfer, a thermal boundary layer occurs. A surface can have multiple types of boundary layer simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|One {{important}} source of instability in a fluid {{is the presence of}} a velocity gradient or <b>shear</b> <b>layer</b> with an inflection point. Thus, fluid instability can be described as a three dimensional region with flow speed on one axis, disturbance amplitude on the second, and velocity profile on the third.|$|E
25|$|The {{streamline}} which {{separates the}} final flow direction {{and the wall}} {{is known as a}} slipstream (shown as the dashed line in the figure). Across this line there is a jump in the temperature, density and tangential component of the velocity (normal component being zero). Beyond the slipstream the flow is stagnant (which automatically satisfies the velocity boundary condition at the wall). In case of real flow, a <b>shear</b> <b>layer</b> is observed instead of a slipstream, because of the additional no-slip boundary condition.|$|E
40|$|We numerically {{study the}} {{inertial}} waves and zonal flows in spherical shells driven by longitudinal libration, an oscillatory variation of rotation rate. Internal <b>shear</b> <b>layers</b> are generated due to {{breakdown of the}} Ekman boundary layer at critical latitudes. Our numerical results validate the scaling laws of internal <b>shear</b> <b>layers</b> predicted by previous studies. Mean zonal flows are driven by the non-linear interaction in the boundary layers. Non-linear interaction of inertial waves in the interior fluids has no {{significant contribution to the}} zonal flow. Multiple geostrophic <b>shear</b> <b>layers</b> are generated due to non-linearities in the boundary layers at critical latitudes and reflection points of internal <b>shear</b> <b>layers.</b> We also investigate the scaling laws of geostrophic <b>shear</b> <b>layers</b> and extrapolate the results to the planetary setting. ...|$|R

Spatially periodic <b>shear</b> <b>layers</b> developing in time (temporal model) are compared with <b>shear</b> <b>layers</b> developing in the stream-wise direction (spatial model). The regimes of linear growth and saturation of the fundamental are quantitatively scrutinized, the saturation of the subharmonic and vortex merging are investigated, and the effects of a forcing phase-shift between fundamental and subharmonic. For the spatial model the appearance of an unforced subharmonic was also examined. It was found that contrary to temporal <b>shear</b> <b>layers</b> a significant control of vortex merging by means of a forcing phase-shift and vortex shredding are not possible in spatial <b>shear</b> <b>layers</b> due to strong dispersion...|$|R
25|$|Jameson’s {{research}} {{showed that}} the kinetics of flotation of fine particles was a strong function of the bubble diameter and {{that the way to}} improve recoveries was to use small bubbles in the order of 300µm in diameter. What was needed was a practical method of making such bubbles in large quantities, of the order of billions per second. The device needed to be simple to construct and operate, capable of running for long periods with minimal maintenance, and should be resistant to blockage by stray large particles in the feed. He began to look at the theory of bubble breakup in sheared flows, that is, in flow fields in which layers of liquid slide over each other. Lewis and Davidson had recently published a theory to predict the maximum size of bubbles in a well-characterised flow environment. By balancing the forces acting on a bubble in a shearing flow, including the disruptive dynamic stresses from the liquid motion and the restoring force of surface tension, it was possible to predict the critical shear rate required to produce a bubble of given size. Jameson then looked for simple and practical ways of generating the required shear rates, and found inspiration in the kitchen sink. If a jet of water from a tap plunges into a basin full of water, a <b>shear</b> <b>layer</b> develops around the jet, that entrains air from the atmosphere into the water, and at the same time, breaks up the entrained air into fine bubbles. The effect is magnified if there is a detergent in the water. Detergents, known as frothers, are used in flotation to prevent bubble coalescence, and to create stable froths. By the correct choice of jet velocity and diameter, it is possible to provide a controlled shear environment that can generate bubbles of a suitable size for flotation, with the added advantage that the air is naturally aspirated by the jet, so {{there is no need for}} a compressor or blower. Thus the idea of the Jameson Cell was born.|$|E
2500|$|There exist {{some other}} {{discontinuities}} in fluid flow than the shock wave. The slip surface (3D) or slip line (2D) is a plane across which the tangent velocity is discontinuous, while pressure and normal velocity are continuous. Across the contact discontinuity, {{the pressure and}} velocity are continuous and the density is discontinuous. A strong [...] expansion wave or <b>shear</b> <b>layer</b> may also contain high gradient regions which {{appear to be a}} discontinuity. Some common features of these flow structures and shock waves [...] and the insufficient aspects of numerical and experimental tools lead to two important problems in practices: ...|$|E
2500|$|Features {{revealed}} by helioseismology include that the outer convective zone {{and the inner}} radiative zone rotate differently, which is thought by some to generate the main magnetic field {{at least in the}} outer layers of the Sun by a dynamo effect. Broadly speaking, the angular velocity of the convection zone decreases from equator to the poles, varying only weakly with depth; the radiative envelope beneath rotates almost uniformly. [...] These two regions are separated by a <b>shear</b> <b>layer</b> called the tachocline, which is too thin to be resolved directly by seismological analysis alone. The convective zone has [...] "jet streams" [...] of plasma (called torsional oscillations) thousands of kilometers below the surface. The jet streams form broad fronts at the equator, breaking into smaller cyclonic storms at high latitudes. Torsional oscillations are the time variation in solar differential rotation. They are alternating bands of faster and slower rotation. So far there is no generally accepted theoretical explanation for them, even though a close relation to the solar cycle is evident, as they have a period of eleven years, as was known since they were first observed in 1980.|$|E
40|$|In {{contrast}} to free <b>shear</b> <b>layers,</b> which grow continuously downstream, <b>shear</b> <b>layers</b> generated by submerged vegetation grow {{only to a}} finite thickness. Because these <b>shear</b> <b>layers</b> are characterized by coherent vortex structures and rapid vertical mixing, their thickness controls exchange between the vegetation and the overlying water. Experiments conducted in a laboratory flume show that the growth of these obstructed <b>shear</b> <b>layers</b> is arrested once the production of shear-layer-scale turbulent kinetic energy (SKE) is balanced by dissipation of SKE within the canopy. This equilibrium condition, along with a mixing length closure scheme, was used in a one-dimensional numerical model to predict the mean velocity profiles of the experimental <b>shear</b> <b>layers.</b> The agreement between model and experiment is very good, but field application of the model is limited {{by a lack of}} description of the drag coefficient in a submerged canopy.

50|$|A <b>shear</b> <b>layer</b> {{develops}} viscous {{instability and}} forms Tollmien-Schlichting waves which grow, while still laminar, into finite amplitude (1 to 2 {{percent of the}} freestream velocity) three-dimensional fluctuations in velocity and pressure to develop three-dimensional unstable waves and hairpin eddies. From then on, the process is more a breakdown than a growth. The longitudinally stretched vortices begin a cascading breakdown into smaller units, until the relevant frequencies and wave numbers are approaching randomness. Then in this diffusively fluctuating state, intense local changes occur at random times and locations in the <b>shear</b> <b>layer</b> near the wall. At the locally intense fluctuations, turbulent 'spots' are formed that burst forth {{in the form of}} growing and spreading spots — result of which is a fully turbulent state downstream.|$|E
