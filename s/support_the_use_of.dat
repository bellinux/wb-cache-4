5|$|In {{matters of}} self-defence, {{different}} interpretations of ancient Hindu texts have been offered.

Ahimsa {{is not meant to}} imply pacifism.|$|E

5|$|While {{there are}} many {{alternative}} treatments used for the common cold, there is insufficient scientific evidence to <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> most.

5|$|Acetylcysteine, {{also called}} N-acetylcysteine or NAC, works to reduce {{paracetamol}} toxicity by replenishing body stores of the antioxidant glutathione. Glutathione reacts with the toxic NAPQI metabolite {{so that it}} does not damage cells and can be safely excreted. NAC was usually given following a treatment nomogram (one for patients with risk factors, and one for those without) but the use of the nomogram is no longer recommended as the evidence base to <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> risk factors was poor and inconsistent and many of the risk factors are imprecise and difficult to determine with sufficient certainty in clinical practice. Cysteamine and methionine have also been used to prevent hepatotoxicity, although studies show that both are associated with more adverse effects than acetylcysteine. Additionally, acetylcysteine {{has been shown to be}} a more effective antidote, particularly in patients presenting greater than 8 hours post-ingestion.|$|E
5|$|Exercise {{therapy is}} {{effective}} in decreasing pain and improving function for those with chronic low back pain. It also appears to reduce recurrence rates {{for as long as}} six months after the completion of program and improves long-term function. There is no evidence that one particular type of exercise therapy is more effective than another. The Alexander technique appears useful for chronic back pain, and there is tentative evidence to <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> yoga. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has not been found to be effective in chronic low back pain. Evidence for the use of shoe insoles as a treatment is inconclusive. Peripheral nerve stimulation, a minimally-invasive procedure, may be useful in cases of chronic low back pain that do not respond to other measures, although the evidence supporting it is not conclusive, and it is not effective for pain that radiates into the leg.|$|E

5|$|Increasing general {{physical}} activity has been recommended, but no clear relationship to pain or disability {{has been found}} when used {{for the treatment of}} an acute episode of pain. For acute pain, low- to moderate-quality evidence supports walking. Treatment according to McKenzie method is somewhat effective for recurrent acute low back pain, but its benefit in the short term does not appear significant. There is tentative evidence to <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> heat therapy for acute and sub-chronic low back pain but little evidence for the use of either heat or cold therapy in chronic pain. Weak evidence suggests that back belts might decrease the number of missed workdays, but there is nothing to suggest that they will help with the pain. Ultrasound and shock wave therapies do not appear effective and therefore are not recommended.|$|E
5|$|On December 7, 2016, Microsoft {{announced}} that {{as part of}} a partnership with Qualcomm, it planned to support the PC version of Windows 10 on Qualcomm Snapdragon systems-on-chip in 2017, beginning with a focus on laptops. Unlike Windows RT, these devices will <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> an x86 processor emulator to support Win32 desktop applications, along with universal apps. On May 2, 2017, Microsoft unveiled Windows 10 S, an edition of Windows 10 designed for low-end mobile devices targeting the education market (which have led critics to compare the product line to Chrome OS). Similarly to Windows RT, it restricts software installation to applications obtained via Windows Store, but it may be upgraded to Windows 10 Pro for a fee to remove these restrictions.|$|E
5|$|The {{medication}} typically recommended first are NSAIDs (though not aspirin) or {{skeletal muscle}} relaxants {{and these are}} enough for most people. Benefits with NSAIDs; however, is often small. High-quality reviews have found acetaminophen (paracetamol) {{to be no more}} effective than placebo at improving pain, quality of life, or function. NSAIDs are more effective for acute episodes than acetaminophen; however, they carry a greater risk of side effects including: kidney failure, stomach ulcers and possibly heart problems. Thus, NSAIDs are a second choice to acetaminophen, recommended only when the pain is not handled by the latter. NSAIDs are available in several different classes; {{there is no evidence to}} <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> COX-2 inhibitors over any other class of NSAIDs with respect to benefits. With respect to safety naproxen may be best. Muscle relaxants may be beneficial.|$|E
