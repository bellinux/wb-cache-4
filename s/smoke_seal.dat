An air gap of maximum 1/8" [...] per linear foot of width facilitate installation and allows smoke migration through the assembly. European dampers conceal this mechanism, with exterior firestop mortar acting {{as both a}} heatsink and <b>smoke</b> <b>seal.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Both {{the door}} leaf (the {{swinging}} {{panel of the}} door) and the door frame are required to meet the guidelines of the testing agency which provides the product listing. The door frame includes the fire or <b>smoke</b> <b>seals,</b> door hardware, and the structure that holds the fire door assembly in place. Together, these components form an assembly, typically called a [...] "doorset" [...] which holds a numerical rating, quantified in hours of resistance to a test fire. All {{of the components of}} the fire door assembly must bear a listing agencies label (with the exception of ball-bearing hinges which meet the basic build requirements of ANSI 156.2 and NFPA 80) to ensure the components have been tested to meet the fire rating requirements.|$|R
50|$|Bourgmont {{participated in}} a peace {{ceremony}} between the Padouca and the Missouri, Osage, Iowa, Pawnee, Oto, Kaw, and Omaha, wherein a ceremonial pipe was <b>smoked</b> to <b>seal</b> the agreement. The Indians whom Bourgmont called Padouca are believed by some {{to have been the}} people later known as Comanche but were more likely Apache. This was the first recorded French visit to them.|$|R

Joe raised his head from the coils of <b>smoke</b> like a <b>seal</b> rising from surf, grunted, [...] "I'll come 'round t'morrow," [...] and dived down to his three aces.|$|R
50|$|They {{are moved}} to a closed smoking chamber and spread on metal grills, but in recent years, {{producers}} have begun using large gas dryers. Wood is put in a firebox, and the <b>smoke</b> enters the <b>sealed</b> chamber. Every few hours the jalapeños are stirred to mix in the smoke. They're smoked for several days, until most of the moisture is removed. In the end, the chipotles are dry like prunes or raisins. The underlying heat of the jalapeños combines with the taste of smoke. Typically, ten pounds of jalapeños make one pound of chipotles after being thoroughly dried.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the interaction of}} sprinklers and unit entry doors for hotel apartments. Full scale testing was conducted to quantify the smoke leakage performance of typical unit entry doors during simulated sprinkler controlled fire conditions. Test results showed that for a typical tight fitting unit entry door without any <b>smoke</b> gaskets or <b>seals,</b> excessive <b>smoke</b> leakage into adjoining exit corridors will result where no additional mechanical smoke control systems are employed. The contribution of fire and smoke doors to an effective fire safety strategy is recognised by most prescriptive codes and standards throughout the world. The increasing international trend towards the use of performance based codes and fire safety engineering design principles {{has resulted in the}} need for th...|$|R
