A simple experimental set was designed and constructed using low-cost materials. This constructed current balance consists of copper <b>sheet,</b> <b>weight</b> pan, and acrylic sheet. A copper sheet was cut into a U-shape and attached {{at the end of}} acrylic balance arm. A weight pan was hanged in {{the opposite side of the}} balance arm with high sensitivity to a small torque. The horizontal segment of the U-shaped copper sheet, which the length l was 3 cm, was located inside the influence of an uniform magnetic field produced by two parallel bar magnets with opposite poles facing each other. The magnetic field direction was perpendicular to the horizontal segment. When a current was supplied to the copper sheet, the magnetic force acting on a horizontal segment of length l carrying a current I in a magnetic field B was given by BlIFB In the experiment, the current was varied from 0 – 1 A. For each value of applied current, the magnetic force on a thin straight sheet of length l was measured by adding masses to the pan until the balance arm moved to the equilibrium between opposing gravitational and magnetic forces. The results showed that the magnetic force increased linearly with increasing applied current. By plotting a linear graph of magnetic force versus applied current, the magnetic field B can be calculated from l slope B. The calculated and actual values of B were 100. 32 and 100. 13 mT, respectively. This constructed current balance is an excellent tool for high school and undergraduate fundamental physics courses.

The morphology of maps of linear polarization is particularly sensitive to the existence and strength of the current sheets, as field lines wrap around them according to the Biot-Savart law, and the linear polarization responds to different projections of field line directions onto local radius vectors. Of the M 1 lines studied, those of Fe xiii (1074. 7 nm) and Si x (1430. 1 nm) are especially promising because of their relatively strong linear polarization.

Against the {{background}} of the required weight reduction in transportation through lightweight construction, the application of hybrid structures, where dissimilar materials are joined together, has a high technical and economical potential.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the drawability of tailored blanks. In order to assess the forming behavior of the tailor-welded blanks under the influence of weld orientations, a finite element and experimental methods were conducted.

The finite element result showed in a good agreement with the experimental result. The result of the experiment showed that a welded part was characterized by a higher strength and lower plasticity compared to those of the base material. Hence, the weld influences the strain distribution of the tailor-welded specimens. This phenomenon depends strongly on the direction of the weld against the direction of tensile load. The lowest strains occur in the specimen with a longitudinal weld...|$|R
