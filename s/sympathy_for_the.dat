5|$|During {{the course}} of their advance through Belgium, the Germans {{committed}} a number of war crimes against the Belgian civilian population along their route of advance. These massacres were often responses to towns whose populations were accused of fighting as Francs-Tireurs or guerillas against the German army. Civilians were summarily executed and several towns deliberately destroyed in a series of punitive actions collectively known as The Rape of Belgium. As many as 6,500 people were killed by the German army between August and November 1914. In Leuven, the historic library of the town's university was deliberately burned. News of the atrocities, also widely exaggerated by the Allied press, raised considerable <b>sympathy</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Belgian civilian population in occupied Belgium. The <b>sympathy</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> plight of Belgian civilians and Belgian refugees continued in Allied newspapers and propaganda {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th {{century the}} fight for Warsaw {{became one of the}} icons of Polish culture, {{described}} by, among others, Polish romantic poets Adam Mickiewicz and Juliusz Słowacki. It was also the main inspiration behind Chopin's Revolutionary Étude, initially called the Étude on the Bombardment of Warsaw. The fall of Warsaw also garnered <b>sympathy</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Poles and their quest for independence.|$|E
5|$|The White Stripes' third album, White Blood Cells, was {{released}} on July 3, 2001 on <b>Sympathy</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Record Industry. The band enjoyed its first significant success the following year with the major label re-release of the album on V2 Records. Its stripped-down garage rock sound drew critical acclaim in the UK, and in the US soon afterward, making The White Stripes {{one of the most}} acclaimed bands of 2002.|$|E

25|$|On April 12, 1861, South Carolina {{artillery}} {{opened fire}} on Fort Sumter to start the American Civil War. While many gold seekers held <b>sympathies</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Confederacy, the vast majority remained fiercely loyal to the Union cause.|$|R
25|$|Law enforcement, {{local and}} {{national}} politicians, and various heads of state reacted quickly to the bombing, generally condemning the act and expressing <b>sympathies</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> victims.|$|R
5|$|Historians hold differing {{views as}} to whether the mounted police were neutral in these {{disputes}} or sided with the employers, although all agree that the position of the police in managing the strikes became more difficult as organised labour became better established. The mounted police disliked labour agitators and strikers with eastern or southern European backgrounds, but they also had some <b>sympathy</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> difficulties faced by ordinary workers, and were often unwilling to actively assist the company owners if there was a risk it might cause disturbances to break out.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the riot, federal troops were deployed in Rock Springs. They escorted the surviving Chinese miners, most of whom had fled to Evanston, Wyoming, back to Rock Springs a week after the riot. Reaction came swiftly from the era's publications. In Rock Springs, the local newspaper endorsed the outcome of the riot, while in other Wyoming newspapers, support for the riot was limited to <b>sympathy</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> causes of the white miners. The massacre in Rock Springs touched off a wave of anti-Chinese violence, especially in the Puget Sound area of Washington Territory.|$|E
5|$|Jack Abramoff {{wrote and}} co-produced the film Red Scorpion {{with his brother}} Robert in 1989. In the film, Dolph Lundgren plays Nikolai, a Soviet agent sent to assassinate an African revolutionary in a fictional country modeled on Angola. The South African {{government}} financed the film through the International Freedom Foundation, a front-group chaired by Abramoff, {{as part of its}} efforts to undermine international <b>sympathy</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> African National Congress. While working in Hollywood, Abramoff was convicted for fraud and other offenses that he had committed during his concurrent career as a lobbyist.|$|E
50|$|On August 11, 1944 Francesco Federico Falco died in misery in Livorno, totally {{forgotten}} by the Cuban government mainly because he showed <b>sympathies</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Italian Fascism {{in the late}} 1930s.|$|R

5|$|Lucy {{is invited}} to stay with John and Fanny, {{as a way for}} Fanny to avoid {{inviting}} the Dashwood sisters to visit them. Lucy, falsely believing that she has a friend in Fanny, confides her clandestine engagement to Edward and is thrown out of the house. Edward's mother demands that he break off the engagement. When he refuses, she arranges to have his fortune transferred to his younger brother, Robert. On hearing this, Colonel Brandon offers Edward the parish on his estate, feeling <b>sympathy</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> unfortunate but honorable Edward.|$|E
5|$|North & South is a British {{television}} drama serial, {{produced by}} the BBC and originally broadcast in four episodes on BBC One in November and December 2004. It follows the story of Margaret Hale (Daniela Denby-Ashe), a young woman from southern England who has {{to move to the}} North after her father decides to leave the clergy. The family struggles to adjust itself to the industrial town's customs, especially after meeting the Thorntons, a proud family of cotton mill owners who seem to despise their social inferiors. The story explores the issues of class and gender, as Margaret's <b>sympathy</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> town mill workers clashes with her growing attraction to John Thornton (Richard Armitage).|$|E
5|$|The rebels {{began to}} cross from Southwark onto London Bridge on the {{afternoon}} of 13 June. The defences on London Bridge were opened from the inside, either in <b>sympathy</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rebel cause or out of fear, and the rebels advanced into the city. At the same time, the rebel force from Essex made its way towards Aldgate {{on the north side of}} the city. The rebels swept west through the centre of the city, and Aldgate was opened to let the rest of the rebels in.|$|E

50|$|Though {{nothing is}} known of Gormonda save what can be {{confidently}} gleaned from her sirventes, it seems plausible that she was associated closely with the orthodox clergy of southern France and had <b>sympathies</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Papacy and the French monarchy. She was possibly a Dominican.|$|R
5|$|The writers created Mahone's {{character}} in the second season so {{that there would be}} a fugitive pursuer who was not corrupt. When the writers saw that the number of antagonists was increasing, they decided to make him the alter ego of Scofield. The writers try to let Mahone inhabit a gray area, shifting the audience's <b>sympathy</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> character. Fichtner, attracted to the potential of the character, was cast as Mahone just one day before filming began for the second season; he signed on for only two seasons, but was convinced to appear in a third.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War, King Kamehameha IV declared the Kingdom of Hawaii's neutrality on August26, 1861. Despite this stance of neutrality, many Native Hawaiians and Hawaii-born Americans (mainly descendants of American missionaries) abroad and in the islands acted independently and enlisted in the military regiments of various states in the Union and the Confederacy. Native Hawaiian participation in American wars was not unheard of; Native Hawaiians had served in the United States Navy and Army since the War of 1812, and even more fought during the American Civil War. There were varying reasons for joining the war. Hawaiians abroad often sought economic gains and adventures through their enlistment. These included the unemployed sailors on whaling ships who joined the Union Navy and sailors on whaling ships captured by the Confederate Navy who served on the CSS Shenandoah. There was also an ideological <b>sympathy</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> cause of the war. Many Hawaiians sympathized with the Union because of Hawaii's ties to New England through missionaries and the whaling industry, and the opposition of many people in the islands to slavery.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of its}} {{emancipation}} agenda, Seara expressed <b>sympathy</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Romanian Jews, and, {{in contrast}} to the antisemitism of more traditionalist reviews, accepted works sent in by Jewish writers. In October 1913, Seara obtained and published a confidential order which gave Romanian Land Forces officers a free hand to discriminate against Jewish recruits. In September 1914, it hosted the journalistic debut of Jewish avant-garde author Jacques G. Costin, who was, with Vinea, caretaker of the cultural pages. Like Arghezi and Vinea, Costin experimented with satirical genres, his sketch story techniques borrowed from 19th century classic Ion Luca Caragiale (Mateiu's father). Some of the poems published in Seara were authored by Arghezi's Jewish wife, Constanța Zissu. Seara was also receiving contributions from Grigore Goilav, the Armenian Romanian ethnographer and art historian.|$|E
50|$|Despite his <b>sympathies</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Fenian movement, Boyle, {{through his}} paper, opposed any Irish {{invasion}} of Canada. His failure to fully {{distance himself from}} the movement led to a break between him and Irish-Canadians headed by Thomas D'Arcy McGee, James George Moylan, and Archbishop John Joseph Lynch.|$|R

50|$|He espoused Egyptian {{nationalism}} {{in many of}} his works, and expressed <b>sympathies</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> post-World-War era Wafd Party. He was also attracted to socialist and democratic ideals early on in his youth. The influence of socialist ideals is strongly reflected {{in his first two}} novels, Al-Khalili and New Cairo, and also in many of his latter works. Parallel to his <b>sympathy</b> <b>for</b> socialism and democracy was his antipathy towards Islamic extremism.|$|R
5|$|In 1847, in {{response}} to perceived discrimination against First Nations people by the Hudson's Bay Company in the fur trade, Belcourt prepared a petition to Queen Victoria to seek redress. The petition was signed by 977 First Nations people, but the Colonial Secretary, Earl Grey, consulted with advisors who had little <b>sympathy</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> natives and took no action in the case. The Company criticised Belcourt for what it saw as his inciting discontent among the local First Nations. The Company administrators decided that the priest {{should not be allowed}} to remain in British North America. The missionary was arrested, but was released after the charges against him were discovered to be unfounded. At the urging of the Company's Governor, the Archbishop of Quebec asked Belcourt to return to Montreal. Belcourt asked the Governor of the Company to retract the charges for which he was arrested. The Governor apologised for what he described as a mistake on the part of the Company's chief Factors.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Jacobite defeat, on 13 February 1692, in an incident known as the Massacre of Glencoe, 38 members of the Clan MacDonald of Glencoe were killed by members of the Earl of Argyll's Regiment of Foot, who had accepted their hospitality, {{on the grounds that they}} had not been prompt in pledging allegiance to the new monarchs. Another forty women and children died of exposure after their homes were burned. The brutality of the incident was embarrassing for the new government and after a subsequent inquiry Dalrymple, who had ordered the massacre, was forced to resign. The massacre helped create greater <b>sympathy</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Stuart cause and may have contributed to later support for Jacobite risings.|$|E
5|$|On 21 August 1917, guards {{surrounded}} the villa on Nikolaevskaya street where Michael {{was living with}} Natalia. On the orders of Kerensky, they were both under house arrest, along with Nicholas Johnson, who had been Michael's secretary since December 1912. A week later, they were moved to an apartment in Petrograd. Michael's stomach problems worsened and, with the intervention of British ambassador Buchanan and foreign minister Mikhail Tereshchenko, they were moved back to Gatchina {{in the first week}} of September. Tereshchenko told Buchanan that the Dowager Empress would be allowed to leave the country, for England if she wished, and that Michael would follow in due course. The British, however, were not prepared to accept any Russian Grand Duke for fear it would provoke a negative public reaction in Britain, where there was little <b>sympathy</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Romanovs.|$|E
5000|$|While {{intellectual}} and {{cool in the}} courtroom, he adopted the strategy of soliciting juries' <b>sympathies</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> perpetrators {{of even the most}} horrible murders. The tactics used in the Preppy Killer trial earned him scathing criticisms from many quarters, including victims' rights advocates, feminists, and the family of the victim.|$|R
50|$|During {{the run-up}} to the September 2014 Scottish {{independence}} referendum, 2014, the party expressed its <b>sympathies</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> cause of Scottish independence, and stated that it had a lot to learn from the Scots. Party leader Borrinjaland also pointed to Malta and Singapore as two other models that Bornholm should learn from.|$|R
50|$|In the 1981 Luis Valdez Broadway play Zoot Suit {{and film}} of the same name, one {{character}} brings it {{to the attention of}} the protagonist that the popular Chicano styles and mannerisms of the day had been pegged as stemming from sinarquismo with <b>sympathies</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Axis powers by the yellow press.|$|R
5|$|The Guise {{brothers}} {{set about}} persecuting the Protestants with zeal. Catherine adopted a moderate stance and spoke against the Guise persecutions, {{though she had}} no particular <b>sympathy</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Huguenots, whose beliefs she never shared. The Protestants looked for leadership first to Antoine de Bourbon, King of Navarre, the First Prince of the Blood, and then, with more success, to his brother, Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Condé, who backed a plot to overthrow the Guises by force. When the Guises heard of the plot, they moved the court to the fortified Château of Amboise. The Duke of Guise launched an attack into the woods around the château. His troops surprised the rebels and killed many {{of them on the}} spot, including the commander, La Renaudie. Others they drowned in the river or strung up around the battlements while Catherine and the court watched.|$|E
5|$|The {{brutality}} and questionable {{legality of the}} earls' actions helped win political <b>sympathy</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> king. Pembroke was particularly offended, {{as he had been}} made to break his promise of safety to Gaveston, and his chivalric honour had been damaged. From this point on Pembroke sided firmly with King Edward in the political conflict. The king himself swore vengeance on his enemies, but found himself unable to move against them immediately, partly because they were in possession of a number of highly valuable royal jewels taken from Gaveston. A settlement was reached in October, whereby the rebellious barons and their retainers received a pardon. The king nevertheless emerged strengthened from the events, while Warwick and Lancaster were largely marginalised. This all changed in 1314, when the king decided to stage his first major campaign against the Scots. Warwick and Lancaster refused to participate and the campaign ended in a humiliating English defeat at the Battle of Bannockburn on 24 June. This led to another political reversal and Edward was forced to reconfirm the Ordinances, and submit to the leadership of the rebellious barons.|$|E
5|$|The {{next few}} months saw the worst {{extremes}} of the persecution. On December 13, 309, Firmilianus condemned some Egyptians arrested at Ascalon (Ashkelon, Israel) {{on their way to}} visit the confessors in Cilicia. Three were beheaded; the rest lost their left feet and right eyes. On January 10, 310, Peter and the bishop Asclepius from the dualist Christian sect Marcionism, both from Anaia, near (Eleutheropolis, Israel), were burned alive. On February 16, Pamphilus and his six companions were executed. In the aftermath, four more members of Pamphilus's household were martyred for their displays of <b>sympathy</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> condemned. The last martyrs before Galerius's edict of toleration were executed on March 5 and 7. Then the executions stopped. Eusebius does not explain this sudden halt, but it coincides with the replacement of Firmilianus with Valentinianus, a man appointed at some time before Galerius's death. The replacement is only attested to via epigraphic remains, like stone inscriptions; Eusebius does not mention Valentinianus anywhere in his writings.|$|E

Although {{he was an}} official U.S. diplomat, Haldeman spoke quite openly about his <b>sympathies</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Confederacy, {{which may have been}} <b>the</b> reason <b>for</b> William Seward's dissatisfaction with him, according to a letter from Swedish foreign minister Ludvig Manderström to Swedish minister Count Piper in 1864.|$|R
