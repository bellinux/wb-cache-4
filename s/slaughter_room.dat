40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to determine whether reactivity toward humans can be used to predict a pig's reactivity to the slaughter procedure as measured by postmortem muscle metabolism. Forty-two pigs were group-reared in six pens with straw-bedding. Pigs received regular positive (HI) or mildly negative (RC) handling training in a separate pen for 40 d before slaughter. Control pigs remained in their home pens throughout rearing. Pigs were slaughtered at a commercial packing plant, and half of each treatment group (HI, RC, or controls) was accompanied by the handler throughout mixing and transportation, as well as a portion of the lairage time and introduction to the holding pens situated before the <b>slaughter</b> <b>room,</b> whereas the other half was not accompanied by the handler. Muscle pH and temperature, objective color (L*, a*, and b* values), and drip loss were measured on the LM, biceps femoris, semimembranosus, and adductor femoris. Prior handling experience did not in itself influence ultimate meat quality (P > 0. 37); however, the presence of the negative handler (RC pigs) at slaughter accelerated (P < 0. 06) preslaughter glycogen breakdown in the LM. Fighting behavior during mixing explained between 13 and 32 % of the variability of lightness (L* values) of the LM, biceps femoris, and semimembranosus. Visu...|$|E

The sites where air was sampled were the meat teaching laboratory, three neighboring coolers and a meat fabrication room. The average weekly airborne plate counts {{before and after}} occupancy were 220 ABPC/m 3 and 52 ABPC/M 3 (ABPC =airborne plate count); 296 ABPC/M 3 and 153 ABPC/M 3; 296 ABPC/M 3; 296 ABPC/M 3 77 ABPC/M 3, and 313 ABPC/M 3 and 99 ABPC/M 3, for the four sites, respectively. In the <b>slaughtering</b> <b>room,</b> the average total airborne plate counts were 796 ABPC/M 3 at 0 hour and 564 ABPC/M 3 at two hours during the slaughtering operation, which were much higher than those obtained before (31 ABPC/M 3) and after receiving the carcasses in site 2 / 3 cooler. In general, airborne mold counts at all sites were less than 20 ABPC/M 3. Coliform bacteria were detectable only during the slaughtering operation and after receiving the carcasses in site 2 / 3 (cooler).

Das 30 amostras representativas de cada tipo, bactérias do gênero Aeromonas foram isoladas em 10 (33, 3 %) amostras da água dos currais e em 10 (33, 3 %) amostras da água residuária da lavagem de carcaças. Nenhuma das amostras da água tratada de abastecimento das instalações revelou-se positiva no isolamento. As espécies isoladas foram Aeromonas hydrophila em duas (2, 2 %) e Aeromonas caviae em 19 (21, 1 %) amostras. Uma cepa considerada atípica foi isolada da água dos currais. Os resultados evidenciaram que a água dos currais pode ser uma importante fonte de contaminação, principalmente para a pele, e através dela as Aeromonas sp. podem chegar à sala de matança.

40|$|This {{research}} was undertaken {{in response to}} a rising trend in the incidence of notified human leptospirosis cases, particularly in meat workers, between 2000 and 2005 in New Zealand. Meat workers constituted the highest proportion (65 % during 2004) of notified leptospirosis cases. Sheep either alone or in combination with other animals constituted the second most important animal contact source of human infection (after cattle). Further justification of this {{research was}} {{due to the fact that}} a number of cases were reported from meat workers employed in sheep-only abattoirs and concerns were raised that sheep may be a significant source of human infection. A longitudinal study was undertaken to determine the serological and cultural prevalence of two of the most commonly diagnosed serovars, Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Hardjobovis and Leptospira interrogans serovar Pomona. Lines of sheep and individual sheep were systematically randomly sampled at a sheep-only abattoir in Feilding from May 2004 to June 2005. In addition, an assessment of the risk of occupational exposure of meat workers to carcasses shedding live leptospires was carried out using a stochastic model. The association between white-spotted kidney lesions and the serological and cultural prevalence of leptospirosis in sheep was determined along with the diagnostic value of these lesions to predict serological and culture status at the line and individual carcass levels. The study showed that the prevalence of lines with sheep seropositive to one or both serovars was 44 % (95 % CI 35 – 54), corresponding to 45 % (95 % CI 35 – 55) of farms. This indicates that nearly half the sampled farms had been exposed to infection previously. The overall individual serological prevalence in the sample of 15, 855 sheep processed was 6 % (95 % CI 5 – 7). Lambs born in the 2003 – 2004 season had a significantly higher serological prevalence to one or both serovars at the line and individual animal levels compared with lambs born in the 2004 – 2005 season, suggesting a strong seasonal effect. The serological prevalence of Hardjobovis was significantly higher than Pomona at the line and individual animal levels. The overall isolation rates of live leptospires from seropositive kidneys of Hardjobovis and Pomona were 22 % and 17 % respectively, and 1 % from seronegative carcasses. From a purposively selected line (suspected of being from a farm with active leptospirosis) all 13 kidneys of seropositive carcasses were culture positive indicating a high risk of exposure of meat workers to leptospires in such a situation. Kidneys from seropositive carcasses were significantly more likely to return culture positive compared with kidneys from seronegative carcasses. The assessment of daily risk of exposure of meat workers indicated moderate risk for eviscerators and meat inspectors ranging from 3 – 11 (95 % CI 0 – 22) and 6 – 18 (95 % CI 1 – 34) carcasses potentially shedding live leptospires respectively, and a high risk for offal-handlers that ranged from 18 – 54 (95 % CI 7 – 91) shedding carcasses. The results from the third study showed that the prevalence of white spotted kidneys was 16 % and 91 % at the individual sheep and line levels, respectively. Carcasses with white spotted kidneys were 5. 2 times (95 % CI 3. 9 – 7. 1) more likely to test seropositive to one or both serovars, but lesions were poor predictors of serological status as judged by test sensitivity and positive predictive values. Furthermore, a positive linear association between white-spot kidney lesion scores and seropositivity to either or both serovars was evident. Consideration of lesion status of lines rather than for individual animals resulted in higher test sensitivity but still suffered from a low positive predictive value. Leptospires were isolated from 5 % (95 % CI 4 – 8) kidneys that were cultured. There was no statistically significant association between white spotted kidney lesion scores and culture test results in the survey data; however, a significant linear positive association was evident when culture data from a purposively sampled farm was merged with the survey data. We conclude that the processing of sheep in sheep-only abattoirs constitutes a definite exposure risk of meat workers to leptospirosis and that exposure risks ranged from moderate to high degrees depending on type of duties performed on the <b>slaughter</b> <b>room</b> floor. Furthermore, since grossly visible white-spotted kidney lesions were positively associated with serological and cultural prevalence of disease it would be advisable for meat workers to take extra care when processing lines with a high prevalence of carcasses with these lesions to reduce the risk of infection. This recommendation is made despite the poor predictability of serological and cultural status of these lesions...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to estimate the seroprevalence of human brucellosis in livestock professionals and analyze the factors associated with brucellosis focusing on sociodemographic variables and the variables of knowledge and practices related to the characteristics of the activities carried out in livestock. METHODS This is a cross-sectional seroepidemiological study with a population of 131 workers of butchers, <b>slaughter</b> <b>rooms,</b> and slaughterhouse and 192 breeders sampled randomly in Namibe province, Angola. The data were obtained from the collection of blood and use of questionnaires. The laboratory tests used were rose bengal and slow agglutination. The questionnaire allowed us to collect sociodemographic information and, specifically on brucellosis, it incorporated questions about knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of livestock professionals. In addition to the descriptive statistical approach, we used the Chi-square test of independence, Fisher’s test, and logistic regression models, using a significance level of 10 %. RESULTS The general weighted prevalence of brucellosis was 15. 6 % (95 %CI 13. 61 – 17. 50), being it 5. 3 % in workers and 16. 7 % (95 %CI 11. 39 – 21. 93) in breeders. The statistical significance was observed between human seroprevalence and category (worker and breeder) (p < 0. 001) and education level (p = 0. 032), start of activity (p = 0079), and service location (p = 0. 055). In a multivariate context, the positive factor associated with brucellosis in professionals was the professional category (OR = 3. 54; 95 %CI 1. 57 – 8. 30, related to breeders in relation to workers). CONCLUSIONS Human brucellosis in livestock professionals is prevalent in Namibe province (15. 6 %), where the professional category was the most important factor. The seroprevalence levels detected are high when compared with those found in similar studies...|$|R

40|$|Listeria monocytogenes is a {{pathogenic}} bacterium {{found in the}} environment and food. It causes Listeriosis, a serious disease that presents largest fatality rate among foodborne illness. The persistence of these bacteria in food processing plants, favoured by biofilm formation {{is a major problem}} both for industry and public health. The aim {{of the study was to}} compare strains isolated from three sectors in slaughterhouses for their ability to form biofilms. The strains were isolated from holding pens, slaughtering, and cutting in 4 slaughterhouses and for 3 different periods of the year. Biofilm formation analyses were performed for 186 strains under static conditions at 30 °C for 48 hours and 7 °C for 15 days, frequent temperature in meat processing plants. Biomass production in BHI is measured in microplates after staining with crystal violet and measuring the absorbance at 595 nm, the data is normalized to obtain inter strain comparability in 96 well plate. Results show significant difference in biofilm formation between strains according to the period of sampling and origin of strains (slaughterhouse). Biofilm formation by strains belonging to the sampling of period 2 (February to May 2014) were greater than in summer 2015 at 30 °C (p 3 ̆c 0, 0001) and at 7 °C (p= 0, 019). Strains isolated from plants 1 and 2 produced more biomass than those collected from plant 4 at 30 °C (p= 0, 0015) and 7 °C, biofilm formation in isolates from plants 1 and 2 were greater than in strains from plants 3 and 4 (p 3 ̆c 0, 0001). No difference in biofilm formation ability was revealed depending on the place sampled in the plant (holding pens, <b>slaughter</b> or cutting <b>rooms),</b> whatever the temperature tested. Among strains studied here, strong differences in biofilm forming ability were identified; these results are the beginning of our in vestigation aiming to answer the question of strain persistence...|$|R
40|$|Abortion {{and death}} of ewes caused by a {{particular}} strain of Salmonella Brandenburg is an animal disease problem that is unique to the South Island of New Zealand. Like most Salmonella serovars, this organism is zoonotic and has caused cases in occupationally exposed people. As Salmonella are primarily recognised as agents of foodborne disease, the potential for foodborne transmission must be acknowledged, although human cases attributed to consumption of sheep meat {{have not yet been}} reported. Salmonella Brandenburg has an additional concern for New Zealand’s sheep meat industry owing to the possibility that contamination of sheep meat products could compromise market access. In 1995, the Sanitary Phytosanitary Agreement of the World Trade Organisation specified that scientific risk analysis was required before countries could refuse to import animal or plant materials on the basis of risks to animal, plant, or human health. This thesis presents initial microbiological studies of the prevalence and concentration of Salmonella Brandenburg on sheep meat carcasses that were conducted in conjunction with other projects designed to address the Salmonella Brandenburg issue using a modern risk assessment approach. The microbiological studies (Chapters 3 and 4) are preceded by two introductory discussions that provide the context for the project. Chapter 1 presents an overview of national and international regulatory approaches to food safety, foodborne diseases and protection of consumer health relevant to meat and meat products. A selective review of literature on Salmonella focuses on Salmonella in sheep and on aspects most relevant to food safety. Chapter 2 summarises information on published quantitative microbiological risk assessments (QRA) conducted using the guidelines developed by the Codex Alimentarius Commission to apply QRA to microbiological foodborne hazards. A conceptual framework is presented for developing a QRA for Salmonella Brandenburg in sheep meat that covers all sectors of the food supply chain from animal production to the point of consumption. Following the precedent of previous QRA efforts, the food supply chain is divided into a series of five modules: animal production; transport and lairage; slaughter and processing; retail and distribution; and consumer. For each module, key outputs (prevalence and concentration of Salmonella in animals or product at various points in the supply chain), and their likely determinants, are identified. The specific objective of the microbiological studies conducted was to estimate the prevalence and i concentration of Salmonella on sheep carcasses from animals originating from farms that had experienced Salmonella Brandenburg disease and other farms from the same region that had no history of this disease. Prior to undertaking the field studies, it was necessary to conduct some methodological studies to evaluate the effect of sample handling procedures on the results obtained with quantitative bacteriology. Chapter 3 presents three controlled laboratory experiments with swab samples taken from meat contaminated experimentally with the epidemic strain of Salmonella Brandenburg. The Most Probably Number (MPN) method was used to quantify counts of Salmonella Brandenburg per 100 cm 2 area of meat swabbed. In each experiment, control samples were processed immediately, and treatment samples were subjected to different periods and conditions of storage. Treatments were chosen to emulate anticipated conditions that would be required for the field studies due to logistic constraints. The three storage protocols evaluated were: Experiment 1 : Storage of swabs diluted in buffered peptone water (BPW) for 48 h at 40 C Experiment 2 : Storage of swabs diluted in BPW for 5 days at 40 C Experiment 3 : Storage of swabs for 24 h at 40 C before dilution in BPW, followed by storage for a further 48 h at 40 C. Differences in counts between control and treatment samples were not tested statistically, owing to the small samples sizes, but were numerically less than one log difference in all experiments. In 2 of the 3 experiments, counts for stored samples were in fact numerically greater than for samples processed immediately. These results suggested that carcass swabs contaminated with Salmonella could be stored under the specified conditions without affecting the results of quantitative bacteriology using the MPN method. Chapter 4 presents a study undertaken to obtain initial qualitative and quantitative estimates of the presence of Salmonella organisms on sheep carcasses sampled at 3 points in the processing chain (i. e. slaughter floor, cooler, and boning <b>room).</b> <b>Slaughtered</b> sheep (ewes and lambs) were sourced from six farms in the Central Otago/Southland region of the South Island where Salmonella Brandenburg disease is endemic. Three farms (case farms) were selected based on the occurrence of an outbreak of Salmonella Brandenburg ii disease during the spring of 2000. Three non-case farms from the same region were also sampled. As the disease epidemics are temporally clustered in July and August, well before lambs are sent for slaughter, sampling was replicated after an interval of approximately 2 months to assess likely temporal variation in risk of carcass contamination. For comparative purposes, samples from sheep carcasses were also collected from 6 groups of sheep slaughtered at 2 plants in the North Island where salmonellosis due to Salmonella Brandenburg infection in sheep has not been reported. A total of 1417 carcasses were sampled in the study and initially tested by BAX® test. Of these, 1214 samples were sourced from the 3 case and 3 non-case farms supplying the South Island plant. The remaining 203 carcasses were sampled at the 2 North Island plants. A total of 138 (11. 3 %) of the 1214 samples collected in the South Island plant tested positive for the presence of Salmonella Brandenburg. No positive findings were obtained from the samples collected in the North Island plants. The vast majority (130 or 94 %) of the 138 positive samples was obtained in the first period of sampling, indicating a substantial decline in risk of carcass contamination in the period {{between the first and second}} sampling. These findings indicated that the prevalence of carcass contamination with Salmonella Brandenburg was markedly elevated in the region where sheep flocks experienced abortion outbreaks caused by the organism. Although clinical Salmonella Brandenburg enteric disease has not been reported in lambs, the first sampling revealed that overall prevalence of contamination was higher (33 %) for lamb carcasses than ewe carcasses (10 %) from the same farms. While the prevalence of lamb carcass contamination was comparable for both case and non-case farms, the prevalence of ewe carcass contamination was strongly clustered and only 2 samples were positive from non-case farms. Estimates of the prevalence of contamination were influenced by the location of sampling carcasses (e. g. slaughter floor, cooler), but estimates of bacterial numbers on positive carcasses were generally similar regardless of class of stock, time of sampling, or sampling location in the plant. No positive samples were obtained from swabs of primary cuts in the boning room. Collectively these findings suggest that the emergence of Salmonella Brandenburg infection of sheep in the South Island may have considerable implications for product safety and public health. A strong case can be made for more research to better characterise the potential risks and to explore potential risk mitigation strategies. While the data obtained in this study have provided valuable insights into several important aspects of the issue, due to logistic and other constraints they have considerable shortcomings with respect to the requirements of the formal QRA. These shortcomings were discussed and evaluated in terms of representativeness and suitability for quantitative risk assessment. Chapter 5 presents an extension of the conceptual framework for a QRA outlined in Chapter 2, by integrating the data obtained from the bacteriological study, as well as data from other sources. Major data gaps are identified and suggestions are presented with respect to options for ongoing research to advance understanding and management of Salmonella Brandenburg in New Zealand sheep meat. More extensive and representative surveys are required to obtain more reliable data on farm, and within-farm, prevalence of infection as well as more extensive and representative longitudinal studies of the prevalence and concentration of the organism during slaughter and processing. It is considered that more systematic surveys at the time of apparent highest risk would be a more reliable means of assessing potential exposure of consumers than predictive microbiology...|$|R
