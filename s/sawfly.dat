5|$|The {{blackcurrant}} leaf midge {{can cause}} browning, crimping and distortion of leaves at {{the tips of}} shoots but it is seldom a serious problem. The blackcurrant <b>sawfly</b> (Nematus ribesii) lays its eggs {{on the underside of}} the leaves and the voracious larvae work their way along the shoots, stripping off leaf after leaf. In a serious attack, the bush can be denuded of leaves. Larvae of the currant borer drill their way along the centres of shoots, which wilt and die back. Other insect pests include scale insects, aphids and earwigs.|$|E
5|$|Cyclotorna monocentra moths feed on meat ant broods. The larvae {{of these}} moths are parasites to leafhoppers and {{will move to}} meat ant colonies to {{complete}} their development, where they will proceed to consume the brood; the females lay many eggs near ant trails which {{are close to the}} leafhoppers tended by ants. Other observations show that the Iphierga macarista larvae are scavengers in meat ant nests, while Sphallomorpha beetles live in burrows near nests of meat ants, where the larvae capture and prey on workers passing by. The larvae of the spitfire <b>sawfly</b> and Pseudoperga guerini are able to regurgitate a fluid against the meat ant if they are getting attacked by them; depending on how much is regurgitated, an ant will either walk away and clean itself or become fatally affected by it. Lizards such as the thorny dragon, which is a sit and wait predator, consume meat ants, but other lizards which eat Iridomyrmex ants usually reject this species.|$|E
5|$|Various {{insects and}} arachnids reside around the Petitcodiac River. Among them is the stonefly, the mayfly, the caddisfly, the simulium, the {{subfamily}} of tanypodinae, and the Hydracarina. Non-native species, such as the black-footed spider, the beech scale, the white-marked tussock moth, and the mountain ash <b>sawfly</b> have also made their home in the Petitcodiac River watershed. At the southern extremities of the watershed, 50 to 90percent of the world's semipalmated sandpipers feed on the mud shrimp at Shepody Bay. Around 269,445 stop there before migrating to South America, a number which accounts for at least 7.7percent of the total population. Among others, the semipalmated plover (around 2percent of the North American population), the short-billed dowitcher, the red knot, the sanderling, and the least sandpiper are also known for migrating through the Important Bird Area.|$|E
50|$|The {{included}} extant families {{share the}} distinctive {{features of a}} medially narrowed pronotum, paired protibial spurs, {{and the loss of}} the transverse mesonotal groove. The superfamily also includes two extinct families. Meicai and Haiyan (1998) identified 66 extant tribes and 17 subfamilies. The superorder includes the argid <b>sawflies</b> (Argidae), cimbicid <b>sawflies</b> (Cimbicidae), the pine or conifer <b>sawflies</b> (Diprionidae) and the common <b>sawflies</b> (Tenthredinidae).|$|R
5000|$|Tenthredopsis is a genus {{of common}} <b>sawflies</b> {{belonging}} to the family Tenthredinidae subfamily Tenthrediniinae. These <b>sawflies</b> are present in most of Europe.|$|R
50|$|The Diprionidae are a {{small family}} of conifer-feeding <b>sawflies</b> (thus the common name conifer <b>sawflies,</b> though other Symphyta feed on conifers) {{restricted}} to the Northern Hemisphere, with some 90 species in 11 genera worldwide. Larvae are often gregarious, and sometimes there can be major outbreaks, thus these <b>sawflies</b> can be major forest pests at times.|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} sawflies feed on spruce trees. Among them European spruce <b>sawfly,</b> yellow-headed spruce <b>sawfly,</b> green-headed spruce <b>sawfly</b> and the spruce webspinning <b>sawfly</b> (Rose and Lindquist 1985).|$|E
25|$|Between 27 and 40 {{invertebrates}} (including nine moths) in the UK feed on bracken. These {{include the}} <b>sawfly,</b> a planthopper (Dytroptis pteridis), the map-winged swift moth caterpillar, brown silver-line moth caterpillar (Petrophora chlorosata) and Paltodora cytisella. The numbers feeding on the bracken increase {{as the season}} progresses due to the decreasing levels of toxin, {{and the production of}} nectaries in the spring, food for ants which in turn may kill any herbivorous insects in the vicinity.|$|E
25|$|Some larvae of the Hymenoptera order (ants, {{bees and}} wasps) can appear like the {{caterpillars}} of the Lepidoptera. Such larvae are mainly {{seen in the}} <b>sawfly</b> suborder. However while these larvae superficially resemble caterpillars, they can be distinguished {{by the presence of}} prolegs on every abdominal segment, an absence of crochets or hooks on the prolegs (these are present on lepidopteran caterpillars), one pair of prominent ocelli on the head capsule, and an absence of the upside-down Y-shaped suture {{on the front of the}} head.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sawflies</b> first {{appeared}} 250 {{million years ago}} in the Triassic. The oldest superfamily, the Xyeloidea, has existed into the present. <b>Sawflies</b> are distributed globally, though they are more diverse in the northern hemisphere.|$|R
25|$|Some {{invertebrate}} {{species that}} feature (partial) sexual reproduction {{in their native}} range are found to reproduce solely by parthenogenesis in areas {{to which they have}} been introduced. Relying solely on parthenogenetic reproduction has several advantages for an invasive species: it obviates the need for individuals in a very sparse initial population to search for mates, and an exclusively female sex distribution allows a population to multiply and invade more rapidly, potentially up to twice as fast. Examples include several aphid species and the willow <b>sawfly,</b> Nematus oligospilus, which is sexual in its native Holarctic habitat but parthenogenetic where it has been introduced into the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{sometimes}} described, e.g., by Switzer (1960), as relatively {{resistant to}} attack by insects and disease, white spruce {{is far from}} immune to depredation. Important insect pests of white spruce include the spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana [...] ), the yellow-headed spruce <b>sawfly</b> (Pikonema alaskensis Rohwer), the European spruce <b>sawfly</b> (Gilpinia hercyniae [...] ), and spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis [...] ) (Fowells 1965, Rose and Lindquist 1985, Ives and Wong 1988). As well, other budworms, sawflies, and bark beetles, gall formers, bud midges, leaf miners, aphids, leaf eaters, leaf rollers, loopers, mites, scales, weevils, borers, pitch moths, and spittlebugs cause varying degrees of damage to white spruce (Ives and Wong 1988).|$|E
2500|$|The {{seeds are}} {{commonly}} eaten by birds, such as [...] grouse, crossbills, jays, nuthatches, siskins, woodpeckers, and by squirrels. Some birds, notably the spotted nutcracker, Clark's nutcracker and Pinyon jay, are of importance in distributing pine seeds to new areas. Pine needles are sometimes eaten by some Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species (see list of Lepidoptera that feed on pines), the Symphytan species pine <b>sawfly,</b> and goats.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to compound eyes, simple eyes {{are those that}} have a single lens. For example, jumping spiders have a large pair of simple eyes with a narrow field of view, supported by an array of other, smaller eyes for peripheral vision. Some insect larvae, like caterpillars, have {{a different type of}} simple eye (stemmata) which usually provides only a rough image, but (as in <b>sawfly</b> larvae) can possess resolving powers of 4 degrees of arc, be polarization sensitive and capable of increasing its absolute sensitivity at night by a factor of 1,000 or more. Some of the simplest eyes, called ocelli, can be found in animals like some of the snails, which cannot actually [...] "see" [...] in the normal sense. They do have photosensitive cells, but no lens and no other means of projecting an image onto these cells. They can distinguish between light and dark, but no more. This enables snails to keep out of direct sunlight.|$|E

2500|$|Spiders {{and many}} of their {{relatives}} move on eight legs – they are octopedal. However, some creatures move on many more legs. Terrestrial crustaceans may have a fair number - woodlice having fourteen legs. Also, as previously mentioned, some insect larvae such as caterpillars and <b>sawfly</b> larvae have up to five (caterpillars) or nine (sawflies) additional fleshy prolegs in addition to the six legs normal for insects. Some species of invertebrate have even more legs, the unusual velvet worm having stubby legs under the length of its body, with around several dozen pairs of legs. Centipedes have one pair of legs per body segment, with typically around 50 legs, but some species have over 200. The terrestrial animals with the most legs are the millipedes. They have two pairs of legs per body segment, with common species having between 80 and 400 legs overall [...] with the rare species Illacme plenipes having up to 750 legs. [...] Animals with many legs typically move them in metachronal rhythm, which gives the appearance of waves of motion travelling forwards along their rows of legs.|$|E
5000|$|Spruce sawflies {{are various}} <b>sawfly</b> species found in North America that attack spruce. There are {{multiple}} species of sawflies, including, European spruce <b>sawfly,</b> yellow-headed spruce <b>sawfly,</b> green-headed spruce <b>sawfly,</b> little spruce <b>sawfly,</b> and spruce webspinning <b>sawfly.</b> Each kind of <b>sawfly</b> attack particular {{parts of the}} spruce during {{different times of the}} year.
