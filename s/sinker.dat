5|$|The {{structure}} of the root system, comprising a vertical tap root and multiple horizontal laterals, develops in the seedling's first year. Thereafter, the <b>sinker</b> and laterals continue to lengthen, and new laterals appear. There are only three to five laterals at first, but this number typically increases to eight to ten within ten years. During the first winter, {{there is a great}} deal of root system development, especially elongation of the <b>sinker</b> root, but almost no shoot growth. By summer, the <b>sinker</b> root has generally almost reached the water table, and shoot growth increases substantially. Around February, the shoot forms a resting bud, and growth then ceases until October. On resumption of shoot growth, the shoots grow rapidly for a short time, while the plant is under little water stress; then, with the onset of water stress, the plants settles into a long period of slower shoot growth. This pattern of summer-only shoot growth is maintained throughout the life of the plant, except that in mature plants, seasonal shoot growth may cease with the formation of a terminal inflorescence rather than a resting bud. Inflorescence development continues after shoot growth ceases, and flowering commences in February or March. March and April are the peak months for flowering, which ends in July or August.|$|E
5|$|The uptake of {{nutrient}} {{and water}} by the cluster roots peaks through winter and spring, but ceases when the upper layer of soil dries out in summer. The cluster roots are then allowed to die, but the laterals are protected from desiccation by a continuous {{supply of water}} from the <b>sinker</b> root. The water supplied to the laterals by the <b>sinker</b> root is continually lost to the soil; thus this plant facilitates the movement of ground water from the water table into surface soil, a process known as hydraulic redistribution. Cluster roots have been estimated as comprising about 30% of total root biomass in this species; the seasonal production of so much biomass, only for it to be lost {{at the end of the}} growing season, represents a substantial investment by the plant, but one that is critical in the competition for nutrients.|$|E
40|$|Soapstone <b>sinkers</b> are {{commonly}} found at coastal Mesolithic sites in western Norway. The {{large majority of}} these <b>sinkers</b> weigh less than 10 g (small <b>sinkers),</b> and a few weigh between 150 and 200 g (large <b>sinkers).</b> They were used between c. 5900 – 4000 cal BC and have been found at residential sites along the entire coast of western Norway, from Romsdal in the north to Lista in the south. The main area of distribution is between the districts Nordfjord and Nordhordland. Large soapstone <b>sinkers</b> have only been found in Nordfjord. The <b>sinkers</b> were probably quarried by the users themselves in bedrock outcrops of soapstone, which are common in the main area of distribution. They are only found at sites situated in marine environments. The close match between the sizes of the small <b>sinkers,</b> the sizes of fishhooks and the main sizes of the fish caught strongly indicate that they were used as line <b>sinkers</b> for fishing with a rod or for trolling. A few of the <b>sinkers</b> are ornamented with notches or incised lines. These motifs are common among Palaeolithic and Mesolithic populations in a global perspective...|$|R
5000|$|In {{ancient times}} {{as well as}} {{sometimes}} today, fishing <b>sinkers</b> consisted of materials found ordinarily in the natural environment, such as stones, rocks, or bone. Later, lead became the material of choice for <b>sinkers</b> due to its low cost, ease of production and casting, chemical inertness (resistance to corrosion), and density. However, lead is known to cause lead poisoning and enter the environment {{as a result of}} the inevitable occasional loss of fishing <b>sinkers</b> during routine fishing. Thus, most lead-based fishing <b>sinkers</b> have been outlawed in the United Kingdom, Canada, and some states in the United States. Lead based fishing <b>sinkers</b> are banned in all of US and Canadian National Parks. These bans have motivated the use of various other materials in <b>sinkers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Barrel or egg <b>sinkers</b> are rounded {{and often}} bead-like {{with a narrow}} hole through which fishing line is threaded. These <b>sinkers</b> are {{desirable}} on rock or debris covered substrates.|$|R
5|$|Emanuel's mayoral {{campaign}} was {{the inspiration for}} a satirical Twitter account called MayorEmanuel, which received over 43,000 followers, more popular than Emanuel's actual Twitter account. Emanuel announced on February 28 that if the author would reveal himself, he would donate $5,000 to the charity of the author's choice. When Chicago journalist Dan <b>Sinker</b> revealed himself, Emanuel donated the money to Young Chicago Authors, a community organization which helps young people with writing and publishing skills.|$|E
5|$|Laevistrombus {{canarium}} (commonly {{known as}} the dog conch or by its better-known synonym, Strombus canarium) is a species of edible sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Strombidae (true conches). Known from illustrations in books dating from the late 17th century, L.canarium is an Indo-Pacific species occurring from India and Sri Lanka to Melanesia, Australia and southern Japan. The shell of adult individuals is coloured from light yellowish-brown to golden to grey. It has a characteristic inflated body whorl, a flared, thick outer lip and a shallow stromboid notch. The shell is valued as an ornament, {{and because it is}} heavy and compact it is also often used as a <b>sinker</b> for fishing nets.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} {{commonly}} caught throughout its habitat, with sand flats, tidal gutters in estuaries and surf beaches commonly having producing good catches. Excessively shallow water, especially in proximity to Zostera beds may produce numerous undersized fish, {{and may be}} avoided if the young fish are too prevalent. Due to their preferred habitat, light lines with minimal weight added are employed to avoid spooking the fish, with a small running bean or ball <b>sinker</b> commonly rigged above a size 4 or 6 hook. Specialist whiting fishermen often use a red piece of tubing or beads to attract the whiting; whether this works {{has yet to be}} proved, but anecdotal evidence shows the fishermen's catches don't suffer. Baits used resemble the species natural prey, with prawns, nippers, a variety of bivalves and beach worms most often used, with more successful catches obtained using live bait.|$|E
5000|$|More recently, {{terminal}} tackle {{manufacturers are}} experimenting with high density composite resins. These materials present a non-toxic alternative to lead <b>sinkers</b> at a lower monetary cost than alternative metallic <b>sinkers.</b>|$|R

50|$|Takatsu throws {{from the}} sidearm, and relies on {{three types of}} <b>sinkers</b> to mix up opponents. His fastball falls in the mid 80 mph range, and his <b>sinkers</b> have {{different}} speeds. Two fall in the 66-70 mph range (Takatsu pitches these with a screwball mechanics, and these pitches sometimes are described as a changeup), while the other can reach 80 mph. He occasionally throws a curve as well. When Takatsu first arrived in the major leagues, commentators called his <b>sinkers</b> changeups, since they were so slow compared to conventional <b>sinkers.</b> He {{is one of the}} few closers that does not throw a good fastball or a hard breaking pitch, relying on good control to make batters hit themselves into outs.|$|R
5|$|The New York Mets {{concluded}} {{the regular season}} {{with a record of}} 100–60 while the Dodgers had a 94–67 record. The Mets had won ten of the eleven head-to-head regular season contests and were the favorite in the series. On October 4, 1988, Hershiser posted eight scoreless innings in Game 1 of the 1988 NL Championship Series (bringing his unofficial total of consecutive scoreless innings to 67) before surrendering runs in the 9th inning. In both the third and sixth inning the Mets got two runners on base only to have the third out recorded on infield grounders to Hershiser. In the ninth inning, Gregg Jefferies led off with a single on a <b>sinker</b> down the middle and reached second base on a ground out in a hit and run play with Keith Hernandez. Jefferies, a rookie, recorded his third hit in four at bats in his first ever appearance against Hershiser. With Jefferies on second, Darryl Strawberry posted an RBI double on a pitch he described as up in the strike zone. Strawberry had fouled off four fastballs before getting what Lasorda called a hanging curveball. After Hershiser gave up a run in the ninth inning 100 pitches into his performance, pitching coach Perranoski removed him from the game by signaling for a double switch before getting to the mound to talk to Hershiser. The Dodgers' bullpen had led the league in saves that year. Howell had recorded 18 consecutive scoreless innings in relief. Howell's scoreless streak was longer in calendar days, his last runs allowed occurring on August 11. It had been 35 days since anyone had scored a run against Hershiser. Controversially, Mets pitcher David Cone attributed Hershiser's success to luck after the Mets rallied to score against him in the ninth inning. The Mets went on to add two more runs on Gary Carter's shallow fly ball that center fielder John Shelby could not secure until it first hit the ground. The ball bounced out of his glove as he lunged for the catch, yielding the tying and winning runs. Despite the results, Hershiser's scoreless inning streak in the regular season was still intact at 59 consecutive innings, as the runs scored against him on October 4 were in the postseason.|$|E

50|$|Following {{the early}} {{termination}} of a shaft construction contract, in October 2012 EuroChem filed a claim against Shaft <b>Sinkers</b> (Pty) Ltd. (Shaft <b>Sinkers),</b> seeking US$800 million {{compensation for the}} direct costs and substantial lost profits arising from the delay in commencing potash production. This {{was a result of}} the alleged inability of Shaft <b>Sinkers</b> to fulfill its contractual obligations and complete the construction of the Gremyachinskoe cage shaft, primarily due to problems with the grouting technology. In October 2012 Shaft <b>Sinkers</b> presented an interim claim letter to the Group claiming compensation of US$ 45 million in costs incurred by them up to and inclusive of 30 September 2012 in connection with the termination of the construction contract. The above disputes are subject to arbitration as specified in the contract. An outstanding advance given to Shaft <b>Sinkers</b> of 495,387 thousand was written off during the nine months ended 30 September 2012. As well, due to the failure of the grouting technology employed in the cage shaft construction, expenses previously capitalised, amounting to 3.116 billion, were written-off during the nine months ended 30 September 2012.|$|R

25|$|In Southern Australia, the King George whiting {{is often}} the sole target for {{fishermen}} who seek it for its high quality eating. A number of coastal towns rely heavily on the species as a tourism drawcard for anglers seeking a range of fish and crustacean species, but King George whiting {{is often the}} most desired catch. They are a relatively easy species to catch, with no special baits, rigs or techniques required and are often caught from jetties, beaches and rocks; meaning a boat is not necessary. Simple rigs such varieties of running ball <b>sinker</b> or paternoster rigs are commonly used, with a fixed <b>sinker</b> employed in area of high tidal movement. As mentioned previously, molluscs, particularly the Goolwa cockle are common bait, with varieties of worms, gents, squid, cuttlefish, fish pieces and especially raw king prawn are commonly successful. The larger fish inhabiting deep reefs are often caught on whole pilchards while fishing for snapper and morwong.|$|E
25|$|Mary Ann Robson {{was born}} on 31 October 1832 at Low Moorsley (now part of Hetton-le-Hole in the wider Houghton-le-Spring, part of the City of Sunderland), to Michael Robson, a {{colliery}} <b>sinker,</b> and Margaret, née Londsale, and baptised at St Mary's, West Rainton on 11 November. Her sister, Margaret, was born in 1834 but lived only a few months. Her brother, Robert, was born in 1835.|$|E
25|$|Burnett threw four pitches. His main pitches were a four-seam fastball and <b>sinker</b> at 91–94mph, {{as well as}} a knuckle curveball at 80–83. Less frequently, he also threw a changeup to left-handed hitters at 87–89mph. The {{curve is}} {{especially}} good for swinging strikes with its 44% whiff rate for Burnett's career. The changeup has also been good for getting groundouts — it has a ground ball/fly ball ratio of better than 5:1.|$|E

25|$|Pettitte {{throws a}} four-seam fastball, a cutter a curveball, a <b>sinker,</b> a changeup to {{right-handed}} batters, and a slider. His out pitch is a cutter at 84–88mph with good inside break on right-handed batters, {{resulting in a}} lot of ground ball outs and double plays. Before his original 2011 retirement, his fastball was measured in the lower 90s and his curveball was about 74–76mph. As a left-handed pitcher, Pettitte has an exceptional pickoff move to first base, allowing him to record 100 career pickoffs.|$|E
25|$|I have {{a sinking}} fastball {{to either side}} of the plate, a cutter (which changes the {{direction}} of my fastball so it breaks instead of sinking), {{to either side of}} the plate, a curveball I throw at three speeds and three angles, a straight change—using the same arm speed and position as a fastball but with a grip and a release that slows it dramatically, and changeups to different locations that I throw off my <b>sinker</b> which look like batting practice fastballs. Different locations, different speeds, and slightly different arm angles on all those pitches give me a wide palette of choices.|$|E

40|$|Waterbirds {{have died}} of lead {{poisoning}} from ingesting lead <b>sinkers</b> in the United States and Europe. Other tackle and litter has also caused injury and mortality to waterbirds. Despite risks posed to waterbirds, no studies of the abundance of tackle or litter in freshwater systems of the United States have been completed. We tested {{the effectiveness of a}} metal detector to search for lost and discarded tackle, and developed a technique to correct densities of <b>sinkers.</b> We then quantified tackle and litter abundance at various sites around the United States. Tackle and litter densities varied among sites, but were generally highest in heavily fished areas.

Ankiel threw a 94- to 97-mph fastball, a heavy <b>sinker,</b> and a fall-off-the-table curveball that was his main strikeout pitch. He struck out batters at a rate of 9.98 strikeouts per nine innings (second in the National League only to Randy Johnson), and allowed only 7.05 hits per nine innings (second only to Chan Ho Park). He came in second (to the Atlanta Braves' Rafael Furcal) in the NL Rookie of the Year voting. He received The Sporting News Rookie Pitcher of the Year Award.|$|E

Over the next ten years he worked in fertilizer plants in Reading, Pennsylvania and Jacksonville, Florida, as a railroad construction worker and sawmill employee in Florida, as a streetcar motorman in New York City, as a lumber camp and longshoreman in Portland, Oregon and as a sailor.

25|$|Maddux {{relied on}} his command, composure, and guile to outwit hitters. Though his fastball touched 93mph {{in his early}} years, his {{velocity}} steadily declined throughout his career, and was never his principal focus as a pitcher. By {{the end of his}} career, his fastball averaged less than 86mph. Maddux was also noted for the late movement on his <b>sinker</b> (two-seam fastball), which, combined with his control, made him known as an excellent groundball pitcher. While Maddux was not known for his strikeout totals, his strikeout totals have often been undersold because strikeout rate has often been measured per nine innings, rather than per batter faced. Maddux alternated his two-seam fastball with an excellent circle changeup. Though these served as his primary pitches, he also threw a four-seam fastball, a cutter, a curveball, a slider, and a splitter.|$|E
40|$|It is {{paradoxical}} {{that lead}} shot and fishing <b>sinkers</b> are still used widely, given society's understanding of lead contamination and avian lead toxicosis. The statutory action taken by governments varies from total bans on both lead products to no regulation of either shot or <b>sinkers.</b> Many {{government agencies and}} field sport organisations are reluctant to use the precautionary principle and the polluter pays principle and regulate use of available non-toxic substitutes. The attitudes of individuals towards their roles in environmental lead contamination and remediation reflect marked self-deception {{about the need for}} changes and the benefits to be derived from substitution. Fatal lead poisoning of highly symbolic, revered species such as British mute swans and American bald eagles promoted development of national regulations to ban lead shot and fishing weights.
