50|$|With two {{interleaved}} stereo pairs, {{the track}} format {{and speed of}} the RCA tape cartridge is fully compatible with the slower 3.75 IPS speed of consumer reel-to-reel stereo tape recorders.

50|$|To {{eliminate}} the nuisance of tape-threading, various manufacturers introduced cartridges {{that held the}} tape inside a metal or plastic housing to eliminate handling.

50|$|Paris was {{the fourth}} color movie {{released}} by Warner Bros.; the first three were The Desert Song, On with the Show and Gold Diggers of Broadway, all released in 1929. (Song of the West was actually completed by June 1929 but had its release delayed until March 1930). The film was adapted from the Cole Porter Broadway musical of the same name.

[...] "Next Year" [...] features [...] "plaintive" [...] vocals performing as [...] "an odd voice of hope amidst wheezing, clattering sounds and crunch." [...] Raggett said that [...] "A Whole Wide World Ahead" [...] conjures up [...] "the acoustic guitar/rain combination in newer, stranger ways, odd unexpected rhythms, Crause noting, [...] "There's not enough shelter from all the madness around" [...] as the melancholy flow gets more desperate and lost." [...] The album finishes with [...] "Footprints in Snow", which [...] "sparkles and twinkles" [...] and was the described as the album's only moment [...] "of hope".

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{documentation}} is to record intentions and methods of practice for four works madeduring 1988 - 90 at Wollongong University and exhibited in a retrospective at the Fourth Australian Sculpture Triennial Melbourne 1990. However, these works need {{to be seen in}} the context of installations made over the past two decades. The chronology begins with works commenced during studies at the Power Institute of Fine Arts, 1969 - 71, and culminating in works made during three years as a post-graduate at the University of Wollongong, 1988 - 90. I have adopted a structure based on Trilogies. The method of documentation is presented in four forms. 1. Written document 2 ̆ 2 Survey of twenty years of installation 2 ̆ 2 2. Photographic record of D. C. A. works. 3. Poetry and poetic texts as radio scripts 4. Broadcast <b>sound</b> <b>tape</b> from A. B. C. National 2 ̆ 2 Listening Room 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 Landscape in four dimensions 2 ̆ 2. In addition I have incorporated excerpts from articles, reviews and catalogue essays written over the years which explicate the work. I have done this because they serve both interpretative frameworks and contemplations on the completed works. Though they may offer other views of the work, they are frequently the result also of interviews or discussion, between author and artist, and as such they record my intentions and attitudes towards the processes and works. These are affixed as part of the appendix...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The {{research}} study discussed and amplified {{in this paper}} consisted of the development and evaluation of two instructional concepts illustrating the procedures for 1) typing an offset master, and 2) duplicating offset copies. Each concept was prepared for use with the Audiscan projector, which utilizes a 16 mm continuous loop filmstrip and synchronized <b>sound</b> <b>tape.</b> The medium requires individual student performance and participation. The {{study was designed to}} determine whether students using the Audiscan (the experimental groups) could master the two concepts without assistance from an instructor and whether they could complete the required performance activities more efficiently than students not using the Audiscan (the control groups). Two experimental and two control groups were selected from a Business Machines and an Office Procedures class at Oregon State University. Results of testing indicated that the experimental groups did complete the required performance tasks without the aid of the instructor. Evaluation factors indicate that the experimental groups were measurably higher in all categories evaluated. In addition, the attitude {{of the students in the}} experimental groups was highly favorable; they preferred the use of the Audis can and its self-contained concepts to the traditional lecture/demonstration presentation. The development of concepts for the Audiscan by the writer of this study demonstrates that it is possible for a classroom instructor to prepare instructional materials of this type at a minimal cost, provided adequate facilities and technical assistance are available within the institution. If it is necessary to rely upon commercial firms for assistance in production, the costs can become prohibitive...|$|E
