On that account, the suggestion of Lloyd, which places the battle at a gap now crossed by the Naas Road on the section between Kill and Rathcoole, is still worthy of consideration.

500|$|The {{size of the}} Cuthbert Gospel {{places it}} within the Insular {{tradition}} of the [...] "pocket gospels", of which eight Irish examples survive, including the Book of Dimma, Book of Mulling, and Book of Deer, although all the others are or were originally texts of all four gospels, {{with the possible exception}} of a few pages from the Gospel of John enshrined with the Stowe Missal in its cumdach or book-reliquary. [...] There was a tradition of even smaller books, whose use seems to have been often amuletic, and a manuscript of John alone, with a page size of 72 x 56mm, was found in a reliquary at Chartres Cathedral in 1712. [...] It is probably Italian from the 5th or 6th century, and the label it carried in 1712 saying it was a relic of St Leobinus, a bishop of Chartes who died in about 556, may be correct. [...] The other examples are mostly in Greek or the Coptic language and contain a variety of biblical texts, especially psalters. [...] Julian Brown concludes that the three Latin manuscripts of John [...] "seem to attest an early medieval practice of placing a complete Gospel of St. John in a shrine, as a protective amulet; and it <b>seems</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> conclude that our manuscript was placed in St. Cuthbert's coffin to protect it".|$|E
500|$|The Abbasid army, {{following}} the reforms of al-Mu'tasim, was a {{smaller and more}} professional fighting force than the caliphal armies of the past. Although it proved effective militarily, it also posed a potential danger to {{the stability of the}} Abbasid regime: drawn from Turks and other peoples from the Caliphate's periphery and the lands beyond, it was alienated from the society of the Caliphate's heartlands, with the result that the soldiers were [...] "entirely reliant on the state not just for cash but for their very survival" [...] (Hugh Kennedy). As a result, any failure by the central government to provide their pay resulted in a military uprising and a political crisis, as had been repeatedly demonstrated during the Anarchy at Samarra. Consequently, ensuring the regular payment of the army became the prime task of the state. According to Hugh Kennedy, based on a treasury document from the time of al-Mu'tadid's accession, [...] "out of the total expenditure of 7915 dinars per day, some 5121 are entirely military, 1943 in areas (like riding animals and stables) which served both military and non-military and only 851 in areas like the bureaucracy and the harem which can be described as truly civilian (though even in this case, the bureaucrats’ main purpose seems to have been to arrange the payment of the army). It <b>seems</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> conclude that something over 80 per cent of recorded government expenditure was devoted to maintaining the army." ...|$|E

2500|$|The digressions {{individually}} frustrate {{readers who}} expect a clear purpose. Each digression {{has its own}} topic, and each is an essay on its particular sidelight. In his biography of Swift, Ehrenpreis argued that each digression is an impersonation of a different contemporary author. This is the [...] "persona theory," [...] which holds that the Tale is not one parody, but rather a series of parodies, arising out of chamber performance in the Temple household. Prior to Ehrenpreis, some critics had argued that the narrator of the Tale is a character, just as the narrator of a novel would be. Given the evidence of A. C.

2500|$|In {{almost all}} {{cultures}} objects are named using {{one or two}} words equivalent to [...] "kind" [...] (genus) and [...] "particular kind" [...] (species). When made up of two words (a binomial) the name usually consists of a noun (like salt, dog or star) and an adjectival second word that helps describe the first, and therefore makes the name, as a whole, more [...] "specific", for example, lap dog, sea salt, or film star. The meaning of the noun used for a common name may have been lost or forgotten (whelk, elm, lion, shark, pig) but when the common name is extended to two or more words much more is conveyed about the organism's use, appearance or other special properties (sting ray, poison apple, giant stinking hogweed, hammerhead shark). These noun-adjective binomials are just like our own names with a family or surname like Simpson and another adjectival Christian or forename name that specifies which Simpson, say Homer Simpson.

2500|$|A 2013 Cochrane review {{estimated}} that mammography in women between 50 and 75 years old {{results in a}} relative decreased risk of death from breast cancer of 15% and an absolute risk reduction of 0.05%. However, when the analysis included only the least biased trials, women who had regular screening mammograms were {{just as likely to}} die from all causes, and just as likely to die specifically from breast cancer, as women who did not. The size of effect might be less in real life compared with the results in randomized controlled trials due to factors such as increased self-selection rate among women concerned and increased effectiveness of adjuvant therapies. The Nordic Cochrane Collection (2012) reviews said that advances in diagnosis and treatment might make mammography screening less effective at saving lives today. They concluded that screening is “no longer effective” at preventing deaths and “it therefore no longer <b>seems</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> attend” for breast cancer screening at any age, and warn of misleading information on the internet. [...] The review also concluded that [...] "half or more" [...] of cancers detected with mammography would have disappeared spontaneously without treatment.
