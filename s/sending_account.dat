40|$|Project Argus {{is focused}} on helping an analyst explore massive, {{structured}} data. This exploration includes exact and partial match queries, monitoring hypotheses and discovery of new patterns in both static and streaming data. We provide these facilities {{within the context of}} a workbench interface, called Data Explorer. We support exploration of data that is a collection of records, each of which is structured as several distinct fields. For instance, financial transfers are typically represented as structured records, with such fields as sending bank, <b>sending</b> <b>account</b> number, currency, amount, date, receiving account, etc. Most fields are well-defined, like a date, a dollar amount, or the receiving bank. Other fields may be longer and of more free-form content, like the body of an email message. In Argus, we have focused exclusively on the well-defined, structured data. As previously reported, we have been working on methods to retrieve such data flexibly to accommodate the lack of integrity and consistency in real-world data, to monitor it for watch patterns, and to identify novel and emerging trends as it accumulates over time...|$|E

30|$|Our {{findings}} {{also show that}} it takes approximately 20  min to transport a patient from the ward to the anaesthetic room, this is a robust finding as it was true of the both the first patient of the list and “time to send” overall and previous findings [13, 16]. Also in keeping with previous findings time to <b>send</b> <b>accounted</b> for the greatest bulk {{of time in the}} patients’ theatre journey apart from the procedure itself. Time for anaesthesia was relatively short on average taking just 9  min with a range from 3 to 40  min. This information will prove valuable in theatre work planning where it would seem logical to implement an auditable standard, that to start with, at least the first patient is called for 30  min prior to the list start time. In support, Collantes et al. in a review of 1, 241 trauma lists found the number of lists stating on time increased from 3.8 % to 32 % when patients were sent for 26  min earlier at 8.38 a.m. instead of 9.04 a.m. [16].|$|R
50|$|A {{summary of}} a Burstcoin {{transaction}} {{is as follows}} : The sender details the parameters for the required transaction type (sending money, creating an alias, transmitting a message, issuing an asset or an order for an asset). All values for the transaction inputs are bounds checked for validity. If the transaction {{is found to be}} valid then the public key for the generating account is computed using the supplied secret passphrase. A new transaction is created, with a type and sub-type value set to match the type of transaction being created. All specified parameters are included in the Transaction object. A unique transaction ID is generated with the creation of the object. The transaction is digitally signed using the <b>sending</b> <b>account's</b> private key. The encrypted transaction data is placed within a message instructing network peers to process the transaction. The transaction is then broadcast to all peers on the network. Burstcoin transactions are based on the Nxt code base. A detailed explanation of the transaction process can be found on its wiki page.|$|R
