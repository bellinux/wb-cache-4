5|$|Cricket {{followers}} {{from the}} south of England remained slightly distrustful of Hutton owing to the perception that he occasionally carried professionalism to excess. When he was appointed England captain, many in the cricketing establishment held his professionalism against him {{with the result that}} Hutton never felt comfortable dealing with the amateurs who ran English cricket at the time. While captain, he was criticised for caution and negativity but also was expected to lead a successful team at a time when results began to assume a far greater importance than in previous years. Consequently, Hutton never felt <b>secure</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> position and was often uncomfortable around the amateur establishment. Like Herbert Sutcliffe, he attempted to alter his accent to match that of leading southern amateurs to help him to fit in. But he did not enjoy the attention that went with the captaincy, and he often worried about the impression he was making.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1142 Stephen fell ill, and by Easter rumours had begun to circulate that he had died. Possibly this illness {{was the result of}} his imprisonment the previous year, but he finally recovered and travelled north to raise new forces and to successfully convince Ranulf of Chester to change sides once again. Stephen then spent the summer attacking some of the new Angevin castles built the previous year, including Cirencester, Bampton and Wareham. In September, he spotted an opportunity to seize the Empress Matilda herself in Oxford. Oxford was a secure town, protected by walls and the river Isis, but Stephen led a sudden attack across the river, leading the charge and swimming part of the way. Once on the other side, the King and his men stormed into the town, trapping the Empress in the castle. Oxford Castle, however, was a powerful fortress and, rather than storming it, Stephen had to settle down for a long siege, albeit <b>secure</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> knowledge that Matilda was now surrounded. Just before Christmas, the Empress left the castle unobserved, crossed the icy river on foot and made her escape to Wallingford. The garrison surrendered shortly afterwards, but Stephen had lost an opportunity to capture his principal opponent.|$|E
5|$|The series {{revolves}} around the lives of Jaypaw, Lionpaw and Hollypaw, kits of Brambleclaw and Squirrelflight and grandchildren of the ThunderClan leader Firestar. The three slowly {{come to terms with}} their unique paths in life; Lionpaw worries about his thirst for blood on the battlefield, Hollypaw considers {{what it means to be}} truly loyal to her Clan, and Jaypaw is bitter that he was born blind. One day, Jaypaw unintentionally discovers a prophecy that he believes refers to him and his siblings. The three attempt to understand their new destinies, and realize that Lionpaw has the power to never be harmed in battle, whilst Jaypaw can walk in the dreams and read the minds of other cats. Hollypaw, on the other hand, struggles to determine what her unique power is. Hollypaw and Lionpaw are made warriors, becoming Hollyleaf and Lionblaze respectively, whilst Jaypaw becomes a medicine cat and is later given the name Jayfeather. They seek the advice of a mysterious loner named Sol, who promises to give them the answers to their destinies; however, they eventually realize him to be a deceptive liar, and he is banished from the forest. Although uncertain of their powers, the three cats are always <b>secure</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> knowledge that they are deeply loved by their parents. This safe haven is shattered when they are forced into a fire by Ashfur, another ThunderClan warrior. Ashfur wishes to murder the three cats in order to punish their mother, Squirrelflight, for rejecting his love years earlier. However, Squirrelflight admits that the three cats are not her offspring, and Ashfur lets them go. The siblings are deeply distressed by this confession, and attempt to discover who their true parents are. They eventually learn that their mother is Leafpool, the ThunderClan medicine cat, and their father is Crowfeather, a WindClan warrior. Hollyleaf is devastated by this, and murders Ashfur in revenge. Unsatisfied, she then publicly announces to the rest of the Clans the true story of her heritage. When the Clans do not praise her for her honesty, but rather react with shock and confusion, Hollyleaf runs away into a series of collapsing tunnels. Presuming her to be dead, and numb with grief for their sister, Lionblaze and Jayfeather realize that Hollyleaf never had a power in the first place. They instead turn their eyes to two kits newly born in the Clan, one of whom could fulfill the third role in the prophecy.|$|E

25|$|People who {{consent to}} a search, {{knowing full well}} that they possess contraband, {{generally}} consent because they are ignorant {{of the fact that they}} have the right to decline permission to search. Under the laws of most U.S. states, police are not required to disclose to suspects that they have the right to decline a search.

25|$|While in the 18th {{century the}} fact that one of its House of Lords {{entrance}} opened directly onto a street caused little worry, in the Ireland of 1922 with a civil war raging, the building was simply too insecure {{to be used as a}} modern-day parliament building. While the House of Commons entrance was surrounded by railings, it offered only minimal parking space and minimal security from attack, and practically no means of escape in the event of an attack. In contrast Leinster House was located well in from the streets that surrounded it, had considerable parking potential and was far more <b>secure</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> event of an anti-treaty republican attack on the Free State Dáil and Seanad.|$|E

In 1956 the original 1897 church, {{which had been}} serving as the parish house, was demolished to allow {{the construction of the}} attached building that presently serves the same purpose. Its architects used light brown brick to better blend with the church. A Roman brick from St. Albans Abbey in England, Sturgis' partial model for the church, would later be installed in the hyphen connecting the two. Some time afterwards, the 1900 house that served as the church's rectory was purchased.|$|E

25|$|In 926 the Bulgarians sent an army {{to invade}} the Kingdom of Croatia {{in order to secure}} their rear for a new {{offensive}} on Constantinople. SimeonI saw the Croatian state as a threat because king Tomislav (r.910–928) was a Byzantine ally and harboured his enemies. The Bulgarians marched into Croatian territory but suffered a complete defeat {{at the hands of the}} Croats. Though peace was quickly restored through Papal mediation, SimeonI continued to prepare for an assault on the Byzantine capital. It was evident that the Bulgarian losses had not been significant because only a small portion of the whole army had been sent to fight the Croats. The Bulgarian monarch seemed <b>secure</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> belief that king Tomislav would honour the peace. However, like his predecessor Krum, SimeonI died in the midst of the preparations for an attack on Constantinople on 27May 927, aged sixty–three.|$|E
25|$|The entourage {{left from}} Rügen and arrived in Sweden in Karlskrona, {{where she was}} officially welcomed by her spouse, crown prince Adolf Frederick of Sweden. On 18 August 1744, they were welcomed by king Frederick I at Drottningholm Palace, where their second wedding {{ceremony}} was performed the same day, followed by a ball, a court reception and the consummation of the marriage. Louisa Ulrika and Adolf Frederick reportedly had a mutually good impression of each other at their first meeting, and their personal relationship is described as mutually happy and harmonious. Adolf Frederick is described as introverted, gentle, and submissive. Reportedly, Louisa Ulrika was pleased with him because she immediately felt <b>secure</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that she was}} his superior. Already during their first day together, she informed him that her brother Frederick the Great had plans for the alliance between Sweden, Russia and Prussia, and asked him to raise the subject with the Prussian envoy, which he also agreed to.|$|E

25|$|The {{states of}} the Mexican Federation are free, sovereign, {{autonomous}} and independent of each other. They are free to govern themselves {{according to their own}} laws; each state has a constitution that cannot contradict the federal constitution, which covers issues of national competence. The states cannot make alliances with other states or any independent nation without the consent of the whole federation, except those of defense and security arrangements necessary to keep the border states <b>secure</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> event of an invasion. The political organization of each state is based on a separation of powers in a congressional system: legislative power is vested in a unicameral congress (the federal congress has two chambers); executive power is independent of the legislature and vested in a governor elected by universal suffrage; and judicial power is vested in a Superior Court of Justice. Since states have legal autonomy, each has its own civil and penal codes and judicial body.|$|E
25|$|Jumping spiders are {{generally}} diurnal, active hunters. Their well-developed internal hydraulic system extends their limbs by altering {{the pressure of}} body fluid (hemolymph) within them. This enables the spiders to jump without having large muscular legs like a grasshopper. Most jumping spiders can jump several times the length of their bodies. When a jumping spider is moving from place to place, and especially just before it jumps, it tethers a filament of silk (or 'dragline') to whatever it is standing on to protect itself if the jump should fail. Should it fall, for example if the prey shakes it off, it climbs back up the silk tether. Some species, such as Portia, will actually let themselves down to attack prey such as a web spider apparently <b>secure</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of its web. Like many other spiders that leave practically continuous silk trails, jumping spiders impregnate the silk line with pheromones that {{play a role in}} social and reproductive communication, and possibly in navigation.|$|E
25|$|When John II of Aragón (one of the Princes of Aragón) {{broke the}} Truce of Majano (1430) and invaded Castile, King John II of Castile, along with loyal {{followers}} including Bishop Barrientos, {{was forced to}} take shelter in Medina del Campo. Although Medina collected tolls from wayfarers, other than an extensive moat, it had few military fortifications, and was consequently not easily defended. Bishop Barrientos offered {{to act as a}} mediator with the invading forces and apparently obtained beneficial treatment for both sides. Nevertheless, everything points {{to the fact that he}} betrayed his monarch; when John II was celebrating, believing himself to be <b>secure</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heart of Medina del Campo, troops of the Kingdom of Navarre burst into the villa where he was sheltering and took him prisoner. Although he was soon released, his detention made him a laughing stock and dishonored the prestige of the crown. It is possible to read into these events, that Barrientos was one of the instigators of the exile of Álvaro de Luna in 1439, preparing the way for the victory of the Princes of Aragón.|$|E
