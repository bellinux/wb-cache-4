40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} verifying the safety of wellstructured transition systems (WSTS) with auxiliary storage. WSTSs with storage are automata that have (possibly) infinitely many control states along with an auxiliary store, but which have a well-quasi-ordering {{on the set of}} control states. The set of reachable configurations of the automaton may themselves not be well-quasi-ordered {{because of the presence of}} the extra store. We {{consider the}} coverability problem for such systems, which asks if it is possible to reach a control state (with some store value) that covers some given control state. Our main result shows that if control state reachability is decidable for automata with some store and finitely many control states then the coverability problem can be decided for WSTSs (with infinitely many control states) and the same store, provided the ordering on the control states has some <b>special</b> <b>property.</b> The <b>special</b> <b>property</b> we require is defined in terms of the existence of a ranking function compatible with the transition relation. We then show that there are several classes of infinite state systems that can be viewed as WSTSs with an auxiliary storage. These observations can then be used to both reestablish old decidability results, as well as discover new ones. ...|$|R

We use a combination of direct and recursive constructions to construct H(2 n- 2, 2 n) with Property P. In order to apply our main recursive construction, we need group divisible designs with odd group sizes and odd block sizes.

40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} {{development}} of hard and ultrahard ceramic materials especially for light weight personal body armors, gas and oil drilling and metal machining in the automotive industry. The properties of ceramics offer many possibilities for high-performance materials used in advanced applications. The combination of low density with high hardness is well suited for this applications such as light weight armor, and where the intrinsic properties of ceramics fall short, composite materials offer a better solution. The superior properties of polycrystalline diamond (PCD) finds many applications {{that are related to}} transportation or security, for instance in oil and gas drilling. In rock drilling applications PCD drill bits are designed to remove rock by shearing rather than by crushing or grinding, as is the case for most other types of drill. Ultrahard materials based ceramics are used in oil and gas drilling as well as metal machining in the automotive industry. Polycrystalline cubic boron nitride (PCBN) is used for machining ferrous materials. Cubic boron nitride does not react with iron at high temperatures {{at the same rate as}} diamond. The paper also reports on a new hard material (B 6 O-Al 2 O 3, doped or undoped) with promising potential in ferrous alloy machining applications for cutting tools in the automotive industry. The materials are according to their application area harder, lighter, thermally and chemically stable, and/or with good high temperature mechanical <b>properties.</b> <b>Special</b> <b>properties</b> like density, Hv(0. 5), Hv 5, KIC, and phases are given...|$|R
