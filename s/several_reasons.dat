5|$|A {{second study}} in 1989 {{indicated}} higher potential ridership of 700 to 1350 daily riders. The state bought Amtrak's New Haven maintenance facility in May 1989 {{and signed a}} service contract with Amtrak in November. (Metro-North Railroad was not considered for <b>several</b> <b>reasons,</b> largely because Amtrak already owned the rail line east of New Haven). Construction of 5 intermediate stations was completed in April 1990.|$|E
5|$|Between {{approximately}} 1967 and 1978, {{large quantities}} of videotape and film stored in the BBC's Engineering department and film libraries, respectively, were wiped or destroyed {{to make way for}} newer programmes. This happened for <b>several</b> <b>reasons,</b> primarily the belief that there was no practical value to its retention.|$|E

5|$|Bike {{maneuverability}} {{and handling}} {{is difficult to}} quantify for <b>several</b> <b>reasons.</b> The geometry of a bike, especially the steering axis angle makes kinematic analysis complicated. Under many conditions, bikes are inherently unstable and must always be under rider control. Finally, the rider's skill has a large influence on the bike's performance in any maneuver. Bike designs tend to consist of a trade-off between maneuverability and stability.|$|E

5|$|There is, however, {{one notable}} exception. In most implementations, COALESCE evaluates its {{parameters}} {{until it reaches}} the first non-NULL one, while NVL evaluates all of its parameters. This is important for <b>several</b> <b>reasons.</b> A parameter after the first non-NULL parameter could be a function, which could either be computationally expensive, invalid, or could create unexpected side effects.|$|E
5|$|Both Schicchi and Buoso Donati were {{historical}} characters. Dante's verses, and the opera, {{are based}} on an actual incident {{that took place in}} 13th century Florence. Dante had <b>several</b> <b>reasons</b> for his harsh treatment of Schicchi: Dante's wife, Gemma, was of the Donati family; the poet himself was of pure Florentine descent. He despised members of the peasant class such as Schicchi. Dante's class prejudice displays itself in several episodes in the Inferno: in one, three noble Florentines, who have died and gone to Hell, ask Dante for news of their home city. A disgusted Dante tells them that the city is now dominated by the nouveau riche.|$|E
5|$|Evaluating {{pesticide}} {{contributions to}} CCD is particularly difficult for <b>several</b> <b>reasons.</b> First, {{the variety of}} pesticides in use in the different areas reporting CCD {{makes it difficult to}} test for all possible pesticides simultaneously. Second, many commercial beekeeping operations are mobile, transporting hives over large geographic distances {{over the course of a}} season, potentially exposing the colonies to different pesticides at each location. Third, the bees themselves place pollen and honey into long-term storage, effectively meaning a delay may occur from days to months before contaminated provisions are fed to the colony, negating any attempts to associate the appearance of symptoms with the actual time when exposure to pesticides occurred.|$|E

5|$|In biology, natural {{selection}} {{can cause the}} development of patterns in living things for <b>several</b> <b>reasons,</b> including camouflage, sexual selection, and different kinds of signalling, including mimicry and cleaning symbiosis. In plants, the shapes, colours, and patterns of insect-pollinated flowers like the lily have evolved to attract insects such as bees. Radial patterns of colours and stripes, some visible only in ultraviolet light serve as nectar guides {{that can be seen}} at a distance.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the fact that the {{universe}} is well described by four-dimensional spacetime, there are <b>several</b> <b>reasons</b> why physicists consider theories in other dimensions. In some cases, by modeling spacetime in a different number of dimensions, a theory becomes more mathematically tractable, and one can perform calculations and gain general insights more easily. There are also situations where theories in two or three spacetime dimensions are useful for describing phenomena in condensed matter physics. Finally, there exist scenarios in which there could actually be more than four dimensions of spacetime which have nonetheless managed to escape detection.|$|E
5|$|Political {{analysts have}} {{suggested}} <b>several</b> <b>reasons</b> for this victory, including {{the popularity of}} Modi, {{and the loss of}} support for the Congress due to the corruption scandals in its previous term. The BJP was also able to expand its traditionally upper-caste, upper-class support base and received significant support from middle-class and Dalit people, as well as among Other Backward Classes. Its support among Muslims remained low; only 8% of Muslim voters voted for the BJP. The BJP was also very successful at mobilising its supporters, and raising voter turnout among them.|$|E

5|$|Soebadio Sastrosatomo {{wrote that}} Santoso's {{selection}} as social minister {{was important for}} <b>several</b> <b>reasons.</b> Firstly, her selection showed that the government truly respected women's contributions to the nationalist movement. Secondly, {{it was a way}} for Sjahrir to show that the Indonesian people were committed to the needs of their people, by having a woman deal with women's issues. After Santoso, other women have held government positions. The second female Indonesian minister, S. K. Trimurti, served as minister of labour from 1947 to 1948. In 2001, Megawati Sukarnoputri became the first female president of Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} trail a {{particular}} bike has may vary with time for <b>several</b> <b>reasons.</b> On bikes with front suspension, especially telescopic forks, compressing the front suspension, due to heavy braking for example, can steepen the steering axis angle and reduce trail. Trail also varies with lean angle, and steering angle, usually decreasing from a maximum when the bike is straight upright and steered straight ahead. Trail can decrease to zero with sufficiently large lean and steer angles, which can alter how stable a bike feels. Finally, even {{the profile of}} the front tire can influence how trail varies as the bike is leaned and steered.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} date proved unfortunate for <b>several</b> <b>reasons.</b> It clashed {{with a public}} holiday, and many people had left {{the city for the}} country. It was an {{intensely}} hot day, which further reduced the number of people prepared to suffer the discomfort of a stuffy theatre. Worse, the threat of an imminent war between Prussia and Austria caused unrest and anxiety in Prague, which dampened public enthusiasm for light romantic comedy. Thus on its opening night the opera, in its two-act version with spoken dialogue, was poorly attended and indifferently received. Receipts failed to cover costs, and the theatre director was forced to pay Smetana's fee from his own pocket.|$|E

5|$|According to Moyzisch, the German Foreign Office did {{not make}} much use of the documents, because {{officers}} there were divided about their reliability for <b>several</b> <b>reasons.</b> There was {{a steady stream of}} documents, which was highly unusual. Cicero seemed to have used sophisticated photography techniques to create unusually clear images, which raised the question of whether he acted alone. Antipathy between Papen and Ribbentrop added to the ineffective analysis of the intelligence. Aware of the Allied forces attempts to bring Turkey into the war, however, Papen was able to thwart their efforts for a time by threatening to destroy İzmir and Istanbul if Turkey declared war against Germany. Being able to postpone Turkey's alliance with the Allied forces and the use of their airfields, Papen told Ribbentrop that the way was now clear to take the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|Although {{all of its}} {{components}} had been tested in target and drop tests, no full test of a gun-type nuclear weapon occurred before Hiroshima. There were <b>several</b> <b>reasons</b> for not testing a Little Boy type of device. Primarily, there was insufficient uranium-235. Additionally, the weapon design was simple enough {{that it was only}} deemed necessary to do laboratory tests with the gun-type assembly. Unlike the implosion design, which required sophisticated coordination of shaped explosive charges, the gun-type design was considered almost certain to work. Thirty-two drop tests were conducted at Wendover, and only once did the bomb fail to fire. One last-minute modification was made, to allow the powder bags of propellant that fired the gun to be loaded in the bomb bay.|$|E
5|$|Although {{all of its}} {{components}} had been tested, no full test of a gun-type nuclear weapon occurred before the Little Boy was dropped over Hiroshima. The only test explosion of a nuclear weapon concept had been of an implosion-type device employing plutonium as its fissile material, and took place on 16 July 1945 at the Trinity nuclear test. There were <b>several</b> <b>reasons</b> for not testing a Little Boy type of device. Primarily, there was little uranium-235 {{as compared with the}} relatively large amount of plutonium which, it was expected, could be produced by the Hanford Site reactors. Additionally, the weapon design was simple enough that it was only deemed necessary to do laboratory tests with the gun-type assembly.
