40|$|Abstract. The {{structure}} of {{vertical axis wind turbine}} with wind speed-adapting {{is based on}} Darrieus <b>straight-bladed</b> turbine. It features that its blades are composed of movable and fixed blades. Through the opening and closing of the movable blades to adapt to the wind speed automatically, the turbine not only can start up in low wind speed, but also realize the conversion from drag-mode to lift-mode. Due to the special structure, the aerodynamic model of this turbine in drag-mode is different from that of Savonius and Darrieus turbine. So in this article, the aerodynamic model of this turbine in drag-mode is established. Then the coefficient of start-up torque is calculated and compared with that of Darrieus <b>straight-bladed</b> turbine which has the same size. The results show that the start-up performance of this turbine is obviously better than that of Darrieus <b>straight-bladed</b> turbine...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{experimental}} investigation is {{presented with the}} aim of evaluating the performance output of two vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) configurations; <b>straight-bladed</b> and curved-bladed VAWT. The number of blades also varied, which are two and three blades. The individual blade as well as the complete wind turbine is tested in a low-speed wind tunnel at different wind velocities and angle of attack. It has been found that the magnitude of drag coefficient increases as the angle of attack increased and the magnitude of lift coefficient decreases as the wind velocity increased. Furthermore, the lift coefficient of curved blade increases and becomes less influenced by the wind velocity for the <b>straight-bladed</b> as the angle of attack is increased. For the complete wind turbine, the <b>straight-bladed</b> VAWT has a relatively low cut-in velocity as compared to curved-bladed VAWT irrespective the number of blades. The three blades VAWT produce higher rotational speed as compared to the one with two blades...|$|R

30|$|This work {{analyses}} {{the link}} between the aspect ratio of a vertical-axis <b>straight-bladed</b> (H-Rotor) wind turbine and its performance (power coefficient). The aspect ratio of this particular wind turbine is defined as the ratio between blade length and rotor radius. Since the aspect ratio variations of a vertical-axis wind turbine cause Reynolds number variations, any changes in the power coefficient can also be studied to derive how aspect ratio variations affect turbine performance. Using a calculation code based on the Multiple Stream Tube Model, symmetrical <b>straight-bladed</b> wind turbine performance was evaluated as aspect ratio varied. This numerical analysis highlighted how turbine performance is strongly influenced by the Reynolds number of the rotor blade. From a geometrical point of view, as aspect ratio falls, the Reynolds number rises which improves wind turbine performance.|$|R

50|$|The {{development}} of Japanese swordsmanship {{as a component}} system of classical bujutsu created by and for professional warriors (bushi), begins only with the invention and widespread use of the Japanese sword, the curved, single-cutting-edged long sword.In its curved form, the sword is known to the Japanese as tachi in the eighth century. It evolved from and gained ascendancy over its <b>straight-bladed</b> prototype because years of battlefield experience proved that the curved form of sword was better suited {{to the needs of}} the bushi than the <b>straight-bladed</b> kind. Around the curved long sword the bushi built a mystique of fantastic dimensions, one that still influences Japanese culture today.
