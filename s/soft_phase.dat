50|$|In the {{exchange}} spring magnet, the hard phase has high coercivity and the <b>soft</b> <b>phase</b> has high saturation. The hard phase and the <b>soft</b> <b>phase</b> interact through their interface by exchange coupling.|$|E
50|$|The {{dimension}} of the <b>soft</b> <b>phase</b> inside the exchange spring magnet should be kept small enough so as to retain reversible magnetization. Additionally, the volume fraction of the <b>soft</b> <b>phase</b> needs to be as large as possible {{in order to achieve}} a high magnetization saturation. One viable material geometry is to fabricate a magnet by embedding hard particles inside a soft matrix. That way, the soft matrix material occupies the largest volume fraction while being close to the hard particles. The size and spacing of the hard particles is on the scale of nanometers. If the hard magnets are spheres on an fcc space lattice in the soft magnetic phase, the volume fraction of the hard phase can be 9%. Since the total magnetization saturation is summed up by volume fraction, it is close to the value of a pure <b>soft</b> <b>phase.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: After an {{introduction}} recalling {{that we expect}} low energy supersymmetry {{to be part of}} our description of nature because of considerable indirect evidence and successful predictions, and a discussion of the essential role of data for formulating and testing string theory, these lectures focus {{on the role of the}} supersymmetry soft-breaking Lagrangian in connecting experiment and string theory. How to measure tan and the soft parameters is examined via a number of applications, and the diculty of measuring tan at hadron colliders is explained. In each case the important role of <b>soft</b> <b>phases</b> is made explicit, and the true number of parameters is counted. Applications include the chargino and neutralino sectors, the Higgs sector and how its results change when phases are included, measuring the (relative) gluino phase, CP violation in K and B systems and whether all CP violation can be due to <b>soft</b> <b>phases,</b> how to learn if the LSP is the cold dark matter of the universe, and baryogenesis. It is emphasized that the success of supersymmetry in explaining the breaking of electroweak symmetry is probably its most important achievement, and implications of that explanation for superpartner masses are shown. Combining many of these considerations, a further application argues that a lepton collider of total energy 600 GeV with a polarized beam is one we can be condent will do important physics even after LHC.

50|$|In a thin <b>soft</b> <b>phase,</b> it is {{hard for}} the {{external}} field to rotate the magnetic moments, similar to a hard magnet with high saturation magnetization. After applying a high external field to partially demagnetize the magnetic moments in the hard phase and after subsequently removing the external field, the rotated moments in the <b>soft</b> <b>phase</b> can be rotated back by exchange coupling with the hard phase (Figure 5). This phenomenon is shown in the hysteresis loop of an exchange spring magnet (Figure 6).|$|E
50|$|From left {{to right}} in Figure 3, an {{external}} field is first applied in an upward direction in order to saturate the magnet. Then, the external field is reversed and starts to demagnetize the magnet. Since the coercivity of the hard phase is relatively high, the moments remain unchanged so as to minimize the anisotropy and exchange energy. The magnetic moments in the <b>soft</b> <b>phase</b> start rotating to align with the applied field. Because of the exchange coupling at the soft/hard interface, the magnetic moments at the <b>soft</b> <b>phase</b> boundary have to align with the adjacent moment in hard phase. At the regions close to the interface, because of exchange coupling, the chain of magnetic moments acts like a spring. If the external field is increased, more moments in <b>soft</b> <b>phase</b> rotate downward, and {{the width of the}} transition region becomes smaller as the exchange energy density increases. The magnetic moments in the hard phase do not rotate until the external field is high enough that the exchange energy density in the transition region is comparable to the anisotropy energy density in the hard phase. At this point, the rotation of magnetic moments in the <b>soft</b> <b>phase</b> starts to affect the hard phase. As the external field surpasses the hard material's coercivity, the hard magnet gets fully demagnetized.|$|E

The planar shock wave propagating into the powder had a peak pressure calculated to be 12 GPa. Extensive plastic deformation of the powders and solid-state interfacial bonding of the ribbon flakes was obtained during shock compaction, resulting in fabrication of bulk compacts with nearly full density. Retention of nano-scale structure, {{and in fact}} further refinement of the grain size, ensured exchange coupling between the hard and <b>soft</b> <b>phases,</b> resulting in magnetic properties better than those of resin-bonded commercially available magnets. Post-shock annealing of the compacts at 750 and 850 C resulted in deterioration of the magnetic properties due to slight grain growth and decoupling of exchange interactions between hard and <b>soft</b> <b>phases.</b> The results illustrate that dynamic shock consolidation employing explosive loading is a viable method for fabricating bulk nanocomposite magnets and the rapid thermal excursions can be controlled to minimize and in fact eliminate the detrimental effects otherwise observed during high temperature sintering and annealing of the powders...|$|R

50|$|Polymers {{fracture}} via {{breaking of}} inter- and intra molecular bonds; hence, the chemical structure {{of these materials}} plays a huge role in increasing strength. For polymers consisting of chains which easily slide past each other, chemical and physical cross linking {{can be used to}} increase rigidity and yield strength. In thermoset polymers (thermosetting plastic), disulfide bridges and other covalent cross links give rise to a hard structure which can withstand very high temperatures. These cross-links are particularly helpful in improving tensile strength of materials which contain lots of free volume prone to crazing, typically glassy brittle polymers. In thermoplastic elastomer, phase separation of dissimilar monomer components leads to association of hard domains within a sea of <b>soft</b> <b>phase,</b> yielding a physical structure with increased strength and rigidity. If yielding occurs by chains sliding past each other (shear bands), the strength can also be increased by introducing kinks into the polymer chains via unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds.|$|E

In order to address this issue, we report here the results of fretting wear study on Cu- 10 wt% TiB 2 and Cu- 10 wt% TiB 2 - 10 wt% Pb composites, sintered using spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique. It was {{found out that the}} addition of <b>softer</b> <b>phase</b> i. e. 10 wt % Pb to Cu- 10 wt% TiB 2 composites has not resulted in the lowering of the coefficient of friction (COF). The combination of steady state COF (0. 6) and wear rate (10 (- 3) mm(3) /N-m) was measured and such properties are even better than that obtained with TiB 2 coatings reported in the literature. For Cu- 10 wt% TiB 2 sintered at different temperature, a lower wear resistance with increase in hardness is being measured. An attempt has been made to correlate the observed wear behavior with the surface and subsurface deformation. The formation of a wear-resistant delaminated tribolayer consisting of TiB 2 particles and ultrafine oxide debris (Cu, Fe, Ti) (x) O-y was the reason assigned for the observed low wear rate of these composites.

40|$|Our goal is {{to unravel}} the {{mechanisms}} that lead to failure of a ductile two-phase material - that consists of a ductile <b>soft</b> <b>phase</b> and a relatively brittle hard phase. An idealized microstructural model is used to study damage propagation systematically and transparently. The analysis uncovers distinct microstructural features around early voids, whereby regions of the hard phase are aligned with the tensile axis and regions of the <b>soft</b> <b>phase</b> are aligned with the shear directions. These features are consistently found in regions exhibiting damage propagation, whereby the damage remains initiation driven, i. e. voids nucleate independently of each other. Upon localization, damage is controlled on a longer length-scale relying on a critical relative position of 'initiation hot-spots'. The damage rapidly increases in bands of the <b>soft</b> <b>phase</b> wherein several voids are aligned with the shear directions. The relative arrangement of the voids determines whether the microstructure fails early, or at a substantially higher strain.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{competition}} of fracture initiation in the ductile <b>soft</b> <b>phase</b> {{and in the}} comparatively brittle hard phase in the microstructure of a two-phase material. A simple microstructural model is used to predict macroscopic fracture initiation. The simplicity of the model ensures highly efficient computations, enabling an comprehensive study: a large range of hard phase volume fractions and yield stress ratios, for wide range of applied stress states. Each combination of these parameters is analyzed using a large set of (random) microstructures. It is observed that {{only one of the}} phases dominates macroscopic fracture initiation: at low stress triaxiality the <b>soft</b> <b>phase</b> is dominant, but above a critical triaxiality the hard phase takes over resulting in a strong decrease in ductility. This transition is strongly dependent on microstructural parameters. If the hard phase volume fraction is small, the fracture initiation is dominated by the <b>soft</b> <b>phase</b> even at high phase contrast. At higher hard phase volume fraction, the hard phase dominates already at low phase contrast. This simple model thereby reconciles experimental observations from the literature for a specific combination of parameters, which may have triggered contradictory statements in the past. A microscopic analysis reveals that the average phase distribution around fracture initiation sites is nearly the same for the two failure mechanisms. Along the tensile direction, regions of the hard phase are found directly next to the fracture initiation site. This `band' of hard phase is intersected through the fracture initiation site by `bands' of the <b>soft</b> <b>phase</b> aligned with shear. Clearly, the local mechanical incompatibility is dominant for the initiation of fracture, regardless whether fracture initiates in the soft or in the hard phase...|$|E
