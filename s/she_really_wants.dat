500|$|Gordon {{pointed out}} that Martha was not stripping, just pole dancing.

She found it hard dancing in front of her fellow cast members, commenting that [...] "There's even one scene when all of the boys turn up at the club and they're looking at me – it's like having your mates seeing you half naked. It's not very nice, a bit intimidating but it's always exciting to have a challenging story line like that. It's worth while in the end knowing that you've put everything into it." [...] Gordon believed that the storyline was a turning point in Martha's development, as she has to hit rock bottom to realise who she is and what <b>she</b> <b>really</b> <b>wants</b> from life.|$|E
500|$|The track {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from critics. BET writer Dominique Zonyeé {{spoke on the}} track, calling it a [...] "high energy, boastful song in which Azealia struts her stuff while reminding you that competitors have nothing on her". Chris Coplan from Consequence of Sound thought that the song had [...] "the potential to a true club banger". Vanyaland writer Michael Marotta described the track as [...] "brooding and menacing", going on to describe Banks' delivery, [...] "Banks slices through her verses {{in a way that}} recalls the magic she first flashed on the still-lethal 2011 track '212'". In a positive review, Chris Thomas from HipHopWired complimented the track, writing [...] "The Harlem native waxes poetics with a dexterous flow. Her rhymes are laden with braggadocios lines about her boss status". In a mixed review, Kevipod from Direct Lyrics complimented the song's instrumental, but was critical of Banks' vocals, writing [...] "'Heavy Metal and Reflective' possesses a hard-hitting, menacing beat courtesy of Lil Internet and a lot of stale rapping by Azealia", while also commenting on the need for a more mainstream song from Banks' [...] "if <b>she</b> <b>really</b> <b>wants</b> to put her career together again". Robbie Daw from Idolator panned the track, describing the song as [...] "trap-lite trash", recommending that Banks spends more time [...] "actually focus on not making shit music".|$|E

2500|$|In April, {{the sisters}} decided to flat {{together}} but trouble arose with Brooke's flatmate's Bella Cooper (Amelia Reid) and Luke Durville (Gerald Urquhart) refusing to move out. Brooke ended up manipulating the two into relationship problems {{to get them}} out but ultimately helped the two and was at odds with Bree's antagonistic view of the couple. Brooke and Bree's mother Annette (Louise Wallace) returned in July 2012 and the cast enjoyed portraying the relationship between the mother and her illegitimate daughter, with Wallace stating: [...] "It's good looking at the back story and what happened in our relationship and where it all went wrong, why she hates me and why I don't give a rats arse about her. We are deeply flawed." [...] She went on to state that Annette would have never; [...] "anticipated having to deal with this part of her past, so it throws her a real curveball when she arrives and discovers Bree has firmly entrenched herself in Brooke's life" [...] and that; [...] "In some ways, Bree and Annette are more similar than Brooke and Annette, which really riles Annette." [...] Following her lack of respect from Annette, Bree held her captive and mentally tortured her. She decided that life would be easier as Brooke and started to adopt her personality, [...] "All <b>she</b> <b>really</b> <b>wants</b> is acceptance and love and, as we're seeing now, she's finding a way for that to happen by adopting Brooke's persona." [...] The storyline was compared to films: Fatal Attraction and Single White Female, though Blampied tried not to be influenced by them. The storyline climaxed in Bree, under the identity of Brooke, attempting to murder her sister and hiding her body in a storage container. Vinnie realised something was wrong and a search party soon found Brooke. Bree tried to escape but was mown down by a forklift. After finally accepting what she had done was wrong, Bree tried to make up with Brooke but ended up being sectioned to a psychiatric ward.|$|E
