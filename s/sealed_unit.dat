40|$|Purpose. Experimental {{research}} of technical state change in metal-metal <b>sealing</b> <b>units</b> of pneumatic valve with two-positioned polarized electromagnetic drive. Design/methodology/approach. It {{has been shown}} that the work peculiarity of pneumatic valves with two-positioned electromagnetic drive and with metal-metal sealing is shock loads during its closure and opening. Such loads lead to intensive wearing process and increasing of gas leakage through the <b>sealing</b> <b>units</b> of different design and made of different materials. It has been experimentally confirmed, that the effective way of wear intensiveness decreasing in metal-metal <b>sealing</b> <b>units</b> is the use of special damping units in the valve Findings. As a result of experimental research it was concluded that including in the valve design of special damping device reduces the stress in the <b>sealing</b> <b>unit</b> elements, which occurs in the <b>sealing</b> <b>units</b> elements during the valve closing, and, as a result, the wear intensiveness of the <b>sealing</b> <b>unit</b> decreases. Usage of less wear-resisting, comparatively to the stainless steel 08 ? 18 ? 10 ? materials leads to the increase of wear intensiveness of the <b>sealing</b> <b>unit</b> contact surfaces. Originality/value. Comparative analysis of the obtained experimental dependencies shows, that including of the damping device decreases the intensiveness of gas leakage increase through the closed valve, which occurs with the increase of the operational cycles. Damping element provides the kinetic energy dissipation that decreases the wear speed of the sealing surfaces of the valve slide and the saddle. ? ?????? ????????? ????????????????? ???????????? ????????? ???????????? ????????? ???????? ????? ???? ??????? ? ??????? ?????????????? ???????? ? ??????????????? ?????????????? ???????????????? ????????. ????????????, ??? ???????????? ???????????????? ????? ???????????????? ???????? ???????? ????????????? ??????? ???????? ?? ???????? ????????? ???? ??????? ??? ??? ????????, ??? ???????? ? ??????????? ????????? ?????? ? ?????????? ???????? ???? ????? ?????? ? ???????? ?????????. ???????????? ????????????????? ??????????? ?????????? ???????? ???? ????? ???????? ???? ??????? ?????????? ??????????????? ?????????? ? ?????????????? ????????? ??????????????? ??????????. ???????????????? ????????????, ??? ??????????? ???????? ?????????? ????????????? ?????? ????????? ????????? ???? ??????? ???? ??????? ? ??????? ???????? ?????????? ??????????? ???????????? ????????? ? ??????????? ???????...|$|R

This study area for this research is characterised by a regional anticline plunging to the east-south-east with large-scale internal architecture comprising transgressive, retrogradationally stacked stratigraphy that dips gently landward and is unconformably truncated by overlying <b>sealing</b> <b>units.</b> The primary reservoir/aquifer targets for CO₂ injection are palaeo-shoreline parallel nearshore sandstone bodies characterised by high porosity and permeability and good interconnectivity. The key regional <b>sealing</b> <b>unit</b> is the Lakes Entrance Formation, which consists of mudstone and marl capable of sealing large columns of CO₂. The proposed stategy for CO₂ geosequestration is to inject CO₂ outside four-way structural closure to allow up-dip fluid migration to the north then west governed by the structure of regional <b>sealing</b> <b>units.</b> Probabilistic estimates of CO₂ capacity utilising the proposed strategy indicate that 1395 - 2575 Mtonnes could be sequestered.

50|$|All {{units have}} {{openings}} {{that allow the}} entire fluid flow through the pipeline to bypass. The brake unit ensures that a hydraulically activated pig is held back against the fluid flow in the pipeline. The fluid pushes against the following <b>seal</b> <b>unit,</b> which channels it into the openings of the cleaning head. The <b>seal</b> <b>unit</b> and cleaning head restrict the flow, resulting in a pressure difference across the pig. Thus, the fluid is accelerated in the cleaning head's nozzles, creating extremely powerful liquid jets. These jets are directed onto the pipe inner wall to remove any kind of deposits.|$|R

50|$|The main {{weapons of}} mounted Myrmidons, skylances draw on either their stored life-force (enough {{for one or}} two firings) or the lifeforce of the pteridon being ridden to emit a stream of blue fire. For {{security}} reasons, the design of the skylance, which is a <b>sealed</b> <b>unit,</b> precludes its use without a pteridon. Since a pteridon is tied to a living Alector, this limits the ability of ambitious Alectors to employ these dangerous weapons in rebellion.

50|$|The {{most common}} {{applications}} of paper cartridges were in muzzleloading firearms.

5000|$|From Dave Robson, Auckland, NZ. - The titiko, karahue, pupu, Amphibola Crenata or mud-flat snail was {{plentiful}} {{in traditional}} times {{but because it}} took a lot of effort to extract the [...] "meat" [...] it was not a [...] "staple" [...] food of Maori. In earlier times it was preferable to travel miles by waka to collect pipi rather than walk 200m to scoop up the titko and spending a lot of effort to recover the meat. The titiko couldnt be used as a relish (kinaki) as it is a <b>sealed</b> <b>unit</b> with a hard shell and a cap (even 2) attached to its body that closes up and is difficult to remove. The only way in traditional times to remove the meat was to either smash the whole shell or to smash the top end and suck-out the soft contents.|$|E

50|$|In 1924 Ernest Fisk (later Sir Ernest) of AWA - Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) {{suggested}} the introduction the <b>sealed</b> <b>unit</b> system (or, more commonly sealed set or sealed receiver) where radio sets could only receive the transmitting service (or services) {{to which they}} were licensed. Under this model, the Government would issue a licence to transmit on a given wavelength (or frequency in modern terminology) and oversee the manufacture of receivers locked on that wavelength. The owner of the transmitting licence could then charge the receiver's owner a recurrent fee that would be used to run the station. This was seen as preferable to the British situation where the Government backed a monopolistic service (the British Broadcasting Company as it was then) and collected a single licence fee from each household with a receiver. There appears to have been little attention at the time to a third possible model; that of the licensee charging for advertisements, as was done in the United States.|$|E
