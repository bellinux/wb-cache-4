40|$|Contiguous {{multiple}} beams {{are used to}} make use of the set of frequency bands at different beams at different geographical locations and achieve the most efficient use of precious frequency allocation. This is feasible only if the interference among cochannel beams is below some acceptable level, by carrier/interference (C/I) ratio. Individual beam patterns of very low sidelobes, which in turn necessitates narrow feed are required. A physically realizable solution to this problem entails either more than one reflector, more complicated optics, or breaking of each feed into a cluster of smaller elements, some of which would then be shared by adjacent beams. The latter, however, requires a complicated beamforming network (BFN) for the proper feeding of the elements. The feedpacking problem is not unique to reflector antennas and exists in lens type antennas as well. The BFN and associated problems are present in the phased array antennas and on a much larger scale. Poor <b>scan</b> <b>capabilities</b> are associated with reflector systems. The scan properties of offset fed reflector systems can be improved by choosing a very large focal length to parent reflector diameter ((F/Dp) ratio, which requires a longer boom to support the feed. In the case of reflectors with cluster feed arrangements, the scan capability for smaller F/Dp ratios is improved by proper adjustment of cluster element excitations. Such a system seems to be appropriate for up to 10 beamwidths scan. For a larger number of beams, systems with wider <b>scan</b> <b>capabilities,</b> such as phased arrays or phased array/reflector combinations, become more appealing...|$|E

40|$|Today’s society demand faster, easier, {{safer and}} more {{accurate}} spatial information than ever before. Over the past 15 years surveyors have seen the introduction of reflectorless technology and more recently, laser scanning. Reflectorless technology and laser scanning has become a useful tool in many surveying applications. This technology has {{opened the door to}} the majority of demands that the community and other surveyors request. Due to this evolving technology specific laser scanning instruments have been developed. These instruments can cost in excess of half a million dollars and require specific software. In recent times companies have introduced laser <b>scanning</b> <b>capabilities</b> into total stations to reduce costs and integrate technology, which has launched the new evolution in total stations with most now having reflectorless and <b>scanning</b> <b>capabilities</b> included within the instrument.

40|$|The {{increase}} of Computed Tomography (CT) as an applicable method for non-destructive testing (NDT) and metrology awakes interest on expanding the application fields, on which CT was rarely {{applied in the}} past due to their requirements on the imaging system. Especially the classical X-ray generation techniques based on bipolar high voltage (HV) supplies restricted the application fields of CT to typical material penetration lengths {{of only a few}} cm of steel. Even with accelerator technology that offers a suitable way to overcome these restrictions only the 2 D radioscopy technique found a widespread application. Beside the generation and detection of photons in the MeV range itself, the achievable image quality is limited using standard detectors due to the dominating absorption effect of Compton scattering at high energies. Especially for CT reconstruction purposes these effects have to be considered on the development path from classical 2 D radioscopy to 3 D imaging. Most High Energy CT applications are therefore based on line detectors shielding scattered radiation to a maximum with an increase in imaging quality but with time consuming large volume <b>scan</b> <b>capabilities.</b> In this contribution we present the High-Energy X-ray Imaging facility at the Fraunhofer Development Centre for X-ray Technology in Fürth with regards to the potential of the CT-system stage according to metrological and other application capabilities and to the conceptual tasks due to the construction and development of the CT system until now and for the future stages.

NEMA NU- 4 - 2008 performance characteristics were conducted with the MR subsystem switched ON and OFF. Influence of the temperature was also investigated by repeating selected performance tests. In the ON configuration, the radial/tangential FBP spatial resolution ranged from 1. 62 ± 0. 08 / 1. 88 ± 0. 08 mm to 2. 83 ± 0. 11 / 2. 03 ± 0. 03 mm at the axial center field of view. The peak absolute sensitivity for an energy window of 250 - 650 keV was 0. 87 %.

No differences could be identified between the ON and OFF configuration, except for a mean loss in peak absolute sensitivity of 5. 1 ± 0. 5 % which was attributed to a mean rise in temperature of 1. 2 °C when the magnet was ON.

Respect to architecture and archaeology, but more generally to Cultural Heritage, laser scanning technology {{is becoming more}} popular as can be proved in the latest works: big amount of data, accuracy, operability are some of its main characteristics that are fundamental in digital (numerical) models representations. If advantages are clear, it’s possible to attend to a continuous and increasing demand for better performances that correspond to the necessity to update and to implement continuously instruments respect to growing applications.

40|$|To verify {{satisfaction}} of communication requirements imposed by unique missions, {{as early as}} 2000, the Communications Networking Group at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) saw {{the need for an}} environment to support interplanetary communication protocol design, validation, and characterization. JPL's Multi-mission Advanced Communications Hybrid Environment for Test and Evaluation (MACHETE), described in Simulator of Space Communication Networks (NPO- 41373) NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 29, No. 8 (August 2005), p. 44, combines various commercial, non-commercial, and in-house custom tools for simulation and performance analysis of space networks. The MACHETE environment supports orbital analysis, link budget analysis, communications network simulations, and hardware-in-the-loop testing. As NASA is expanding its Space Communications and Navigation (<b>SCaN)</b> <b>capabilities</b> to support planned and future missions, building infrastructure to maintain services and developing enabling technologies, an important and broader role is seen for MACHETE in design-phase evaluation of future SCaN architectures. To support evaluation of the developing Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) field and its applicability for space networks, JPL developed MACHETE models for DTN Bundle Protocol (BP) and Licklider/Long-haul Transmission Protocol (LTP). DTN is an Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) architecture providing communication in and/or through highly stressed networking environments such as space exploration and battlefield networks. Stressed networking environments include those with intermittent (predictable and unknown) connectivity, large and/or variable delays, and high bit error rates. To provide its services over existing domain specific protocols, the DTN protocols reside at the application layer of the TCP/IP stack, forming a store-and-forward overlay network.

40|$|A bench-top {{miniature}} {{mass spectrometry}} system, Mini 12, with a rectilinear ion trap mass analyzer {{has been developed}} and characterized in this thesis work. The ion processing system, vacuum system, and control system were designed. An integrated sample loading system facilitates the automated operation. A user interface has been developed to acquire and to display analytical results for personnel who have limited mass spectrometry knowledge. Peak widths of 0. 6 Thomson (full width at half maximum) and mass range of up to m/z 900 were both demonstrated. Multi-stage MS experiments up to MS 5 were accomplished. Consumable cartridges have been designed for use with ambient paper spray ionization and the recently developed extraction spray ionization method has been employed to improve the quantitation performance. Detecting trace-level therapeutic drugs, monitoring food safety, and environmental protection, were demonstrated. MS/MS <b>scan</b> <b>capabilities</b> were implemented for obtaining the intensities of the fragment ions from the analyte and its internal standard, of which the ratio was used in quantitative analysis of complex samples. Limits of quantitation (LOQ) of 7. 5 ng/mL with relative standard deviations below 10 % have been achieved for selected therapeutic drugs in whole blood throughout their therapeutic ranges. ^ By way of developing 3 D arrays {{of large numbers of}} ion traps but with simple configurations, the concept of ion sponge has also been explored in this thesis work. An ion sponge device with 484 trapping units in a volume of 10 × 10 × 3. 2 cm has been constructed by simply stacking 9 meshes together. A single rf was used for trapping ions and mass-selective ion processing. The ion sponge provides a large trapping capacity and is highly transparent for transfer of ions, neutrals, and photons for gas phase ion processing. Multiple layers of quadrupole ion traps, with 121 trapping units in each layer, can operate as a single device for MS or MS/MS analysis, or as a series of mass-selective trapping devices with interlayer ion transfers facilitated by AC and DC voltages. Automatic sorting of ions to different trapping layers based on their mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios was achieved with traps of different sizes. Tandem in-space MS/MS has also been demonstrated with precursor ions and fragment ions trapped in separate locations. ^ Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is an essential tool in complex mixture analysis, due to its capability of elucidating chemical structures, suppressing chemical noises, and achieving quantitation at high precisions. The typical MS/MS analysis has been done by isolating the target precursor ions, while wasting other ions, followed by a fragmentation that produces the product ions. In this thesis, configurations of dual linear ion traps were explored to develop high efficiency MS/MS analysis. The ions trapped in the first linear ion trap were axially, mass-selectively transferred to the second linear ion trap for MS/MS analysis. Ions from multiple compounds simultaneously introduced into the mass spectrometer could be sequentially analyzed. This development enables a highly efficient use of sample and also significantly improves the analysis speed and the quantitation precision for the ion trap mass spectrometers with discontinuous atmospheric pressure interfaces, especially for the miniature systems with ambient ionization sources.
