6000|$|To filter Muddy Water.--When, at the watering-place, {{there is}} little else but a mess of mud and filth, take a good handful of grass or rushes, and tie it roughly {{together}} {{in the form of}} a cone, 6 or 8 inches long; then dipping the broad end into the puddle, and turning it up, a streamlet of fluid will trickle down through the small end. This excellent plan is used by the Northern Bushmen--at their wells quantities of these bundles are found lying about. (Anderson.) Otherwise suck water through your handkerchief by putting it over the mouth of your mug, or by throwing it on the gritty mess as it lies in the puddle. For obtaining a copious supply, the most perfect plan, if you have means, is to bore a cask full of auger holes, and put another small one, that has had the bottom knocked out, inside it; and then to fill the space between the two, with grass, moss, etc. Sink the whole in the midst of the pond; the water will run through the auger-holes, filter through the moss, and rise in the inner cask clear of weeds and sand. If you have only a single cask, holes may be bored in the lower part of its sides, and alternate layers of sand and grass thrown in, till they cover the holes; through these layers, the water will strain. Or any coarse bag, kept open with hoops made on the spot, may be moored in the mud, by placing a heavy stone inside; it will act on The same principle, but less efficiently than the casks. Sand, charcoal, sponge, and wood, are the substances most commonly used in properly constructed filters: peat charcoal is excellent. Charcoal acts not only as a mechanical filter for <b>solid</b> <b>impurities,</b> but it has the further advantage of absorbing putrid gases. (See below, [...] "Putrid Water.")

40|$|Abstract. Natural and {{anthropogenic}} aerosols have {{a direct}} impact on the earth's radiative balance. Many of the common atmospheric aerosols contain hygroscopic salts and therefore their physical state and composition are sensitive to the relative humidity. The phase of the aerosol particle will dramatically affect the relative rates of atmospheric reactions, and radiative properties such as scattering and optical activity. In order to understand these atmospheric processes and provide accurate input for global modeling, it is imperative that these phase tran-sitions be well defined.

For the efficient treatment of the transition layer, it is necessary clearly to understand the structure and composition of the layer. In this paper, the physical structure and chemical composition of the layer were systematically, layer by layer and phase by phase, analyzed by modern instrumental methods The results show that (1 ）the layer is an emulsion which is composed of oil, water and suspended solids. The water phase has characteristics of weak alkaline, high salinity and viscous polymer. The oil phase contains many natural emulsifiers such as colloid, asphaltene and so on.

In this research, the homogenization behaviour of both lance bubbling and mechanical agitation through two different impellers has been investigated experimentally (power drawn, decolourusation, PIV) and numerically. At equivalent mean specific energy dissipation rates, maximum velocities are higher and mixing times are shorter with the impellers, without to cause surface gas entrainment, the latter being detrimental to fluxing. Two different impellers have been analysed because one is designed to resist at high temperature, STAS, and its material (graphite) does not allow a standard shape, so it was necessary to compare its performance with a standard impeller, 3 PBT 30. In conclusion, the STAS impeller has been considered a good solution for this kind of cleaning process, in fact, despite the strange shape (very thick blades), the impeller shows nice properties like a standard impeller, 3 PBT 30.
