Heme b varied between 40 ± 10 pmol L- 1 in the prebloom period up to a maximum of 700 ± 400 pmol L- 1 just prior to the time of the primary chlorophyll a maximum. Thereafter, heme b concentrations decreased again to an average of 120 ± 60 pmol L- 1. When normalised to total particulate carbon, heme b was most abundant during the initiation of the nutrient replete spring bloom, when ratios reached 52 ± 24 μmol mol- 1; ten times higher than values observed both pre and post the primary bloom. Concentrations of heme b correlated with those of chlorophyll a. Nevertheless, differences were observed in the relative concentrations of the two parameters, with heme b concentrations increasing relative to chlorophyll a during the growth of the primary bloom, decreasing over the period of the secondary bloom and increasing again through the latter period of the experiment.

Widespread soil degradation, growing water scarcity, and looming threat of climate change further compound the problem of achieving food and nutritional security along with improved livelihoods. Large yield gaps in drylands provide a huge opportunity to increase the food production for future food security and mainstreaming of drylands. Soil management for correcting micro and <b>secondary</b> <b>nutrient</b> deficiencies has shown to increase crop productivity by 20 – 66 % in Karnataka, India. During 2009 – 2013 in this state, more than 5 million farmers benefitted and net economic benefits through increased production were estimated {{to the tune of}} US$ 353 million (Rs. 1963 crores). Balanced nutrition led to increased nitrogen uptake efficiency, utilization efficiency, and use efficiency for grain yield and harvest index. Best practices like soil test-based fertilization including micronutrients and improved cultivars also contribute to increasing rainwater use efficiency in crops by channelizing unproductive evaporation loss into productive transpiration. In current rainy fallow regions, the landform management like broadbed and furrow along with balanced nutrition has shown that fallow lands in black soil regions in Madhya Pradesh can be successfully cultivated to grow soybean crop. Similarly soil fertility management along with other best practices provides opportunities for intensification through cultivating 11. 4 million ha rice fallow in India by growing of early maturing chickpea. Thus, efficient rainy and post-rice fallow management is a way forward to enhance land use efficiency for higher productivity and incomes. Along with productivity and economic benefits, improved soil-nutrient-crop-water management is found to contribute to organic C building, enhancing microbial activity and resilience building of production systems.

40|$|Intensification of {{smallholder}} {{agriculture in}} sub-Saharan Africa {{is necessary to}} address rural poverty and natural resource degradation. Integrated Soil Fertility Management (ISFM) is a means to enhance crop productivity while maximizing the agronomic efficiency (AE) of applied inputs, and can thus contribute to sustainable intensification. ISFM consists {{of a set of}} best practices, preferably used in combination, including the use of appropriate germplasm, the appropriate use of fertilizer and of organic resources, and good agronomic practices. The large variability in soil fertility conditions within smallholder farms is also recognised within ISFM, including soils with constraints beyond those addressed by fertilizer and organic inputs. The variable biophysical environments that characterize smallholder farming systems have profound effects on crop productivity and AE and targeted application of limited agro-inputs and management practices is necessary to enhance AE. Further, management decisions depend on the farmer's resource endowments and production objectives. In this paper we discuss the "local adaptation" component of ISFM and how this can be conceptualized within an ISFM framework, backstopped by analysis of AE at plot and farm level. At plot level, a set of four constraints to maximum AE is discussed in relation to "local adaptation": soil acidity, <b>secondary</b> <b>nutrient</b> and micro-nutrient (SMN) deficiencies, physical constraints, and drought stress. In each of these cases, examples are presented whereby amendments and/or practices addressing these have a significantly positive impact on fertilizer AE, including mechanistic principles underlying these effects. While the impact of such amendments and/or practices is easily understood for some practices (e. g., the application of SMNs where these are limiting), for others, more complex interactions with fertilizer AE can be identified (e. g., water harvesting under varying rainfall conditions). At farm scale, adjusting fertilizer applications within-farm soil fertility gradients has the potential to increase AE compared with blanket recommendations, in particular where fertility gradients are strong. In the final section, "local adaption" is discussed in relation to scale issues and decision support tools are evaluated as a means to create a better understanding of complexity at farm level and to communicate best scenarios for allocating agro-inputs and management practices within heterogeneous farming environments...|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of {{agriculture}} is food production. There are always limited resources available for food production, thus the resource efficiency is always the key issue. The modern agriculture is using resources like external nutrients (fertilizers) and non renewable energy in large scale. The high production intensity results in high production per hectare, {{on the other hand}} it results also in serious environmental harms. Organic farming is based on more internal and renewable resources than conventional farming. Very often it results also in lower production intensity and lower production per hectare. There is a common criticism against organic agriculture as inefficient use of land and also inefficient use of nutrients and energy per output unit.

In year two, winter wheat (Pioneer 25 R 54) was planted in 2010 - 11 growing season, followed by double crop soybean (Pioneer 94 Y 06). The second year was to investigate the residual impact of S applied in 2010 versus a second application in 2011. The second study year used a similar experimental design of split plot 4 x 5 factorial with 4 replications in a randomized complete block design in the same treatment plots as the first study year.

40|$|Williams, Christopher K. D'Amico, VincentForested {{riparian}} corridors exist {{because of}} inadvertent habitat fragmentation or purposeful establishment to protect water quality. Previous {{studies have focused}} on the extent of a buffer required to prevent nutrient (e. g. phosphorus) enrichment of surface waters through runoff. If forested corridors are to be effective nutrient buffers, {{it is important to understand}} the patterns of nutrient deposition in buffer soils and the long-term potential for nutrients leaching via shallow groundwater. The first section of this research focuses on patterns of phosphorus and <b>secondary</b> <b>nutrient</b> enrichment and saturation within forested buffers. By testing soil cores taken across the widths of forested riparian corridors bordering active agricultural fields, I found significant declines in phosphorus concentration and saturation levels after 10 m. Phosphorus saturation levels were low to moderate, and none of the buffers I sampled showed a high risk of phosphorus leaching into shallow groundwater. I also found significant declines in base saturation and cation exchange capacity, as well as in the concentrations of calcium, manganese, and potassium as distance from the edge of the buffer increased. These changes suggest that the declines in phosphorus and phosphorus saturation may be due in part to changes in nutrient cycling within the buffer and not entirely due to differential rates of phosphorus deposition. Regardless of the cause of the declining phosphorus concentrations, my data suggest that a forested buffer of 10 m is sufficient under most conditions for the protection of surface waters from phosphorus runoff, though wider buffers may be advisable if active management of the buffer is anticipated. Whether resulting from an effort to protect surface waters or as a natural consequence of human land use patterns, fragmented forested riparian corridors may be the only forest habitat available. As such, they are an opportunity to promote biodiversity within managed ecosystems, and a prime target for efforts to promote biotic integrity. Invasion by non-native plants is one threat to biotic integrity and native biodiversity that is of particular concern in fragmented landscapes. The second section of this research examines the role of corridor width in the exclusion of non-native invasive plants. Some invasive plants, being edge specialists or generalists, have been shown to be less competitive in forest interior habitats. By examining the prevalence of several non-native plants across the forested corridors of varying widths, I determined the extent to which increasing buffer width may help prevent invasive plant domination within corridors and especially along stream banks. While Japanese honeysuckle and multi-flora rose did not significantly decline across corridor widths, Oriental bittersweet and garlic mustard showed strong declines after 20 m. These findings suggest that modest increases in riparian corridor width can have a positive impact on the exclusion of some exotic species from forest interiors and may help to improve the biotic integrity of these habitats.

Rice-wheat cropping system has a capacity to produce more than 8 tons of cereal grain/ha per year removing 400 to 700 kg/ha nutrients from soil against the use of 440 kg/ha nutrients for rice-wheat cropping system (Islam, 1995; Kamal et al., 1999; Prasad et al., 1999). The rice-wheat cropping systems, therefore, cause a considerable depletion of soil nutrients clearly posing an alarming threat to the long-term productivity. Consequently, farmers are compelled to increase fertilizer doses each year to realize the same yield levels which had been obtained with relatively low amounts of fertilizers in the past (Ahlawat et al., 1998; Islam et al., 1999; Islam, 2002). In addition, deficiencies of a number of micronutrients, such as zinc, manganese and boron, and <b>secondary</b> <b>nutrients</b> like sulphur have been reported (Jahiruddin et al., 1994; Islam et al., 1999; Uddin et al., 2002). Despite national fertilizer recommendations in many developing countries, chemical exhaustion of soils still continues (Stoorvogel et al., 1993) as the use o...|$|R
30|$|The composts {{prepared}} {{following this}} methodology were evaluated in on-farm studies in India—vermi-compost in Sagar district during 2011 – 2012 post-rainy season (6 trials with chickpea, 9 trials with wheat) and aerobic-compost in Kadapa district during 2016 rainy season (40 trials with paddy crop). The treatments evaluated were, (1) Balanced nutrition (BN) comprising of soil test-based addition of N, P and K along with deficient micro- and <b>secondary</b> <b>nutrients</b> (i.e. S, Zn and B), and (2) Integrated nutrient management (INM) i.e. 75 % of BN inputs + compost. The vermi- or aerobic-compost was added {{on the basis}} to replace 25 % of N requirement in case of non-legumes and 25 % of P requirement in legumes. The on-farm treatment size was 2000  m 2 side by side. All other crop management practices were similar in both the treatments. Composts and all required nutrients except N in non-legumes were added as basal application. In case of N in non-legumes, 50 % was added as basal and 25 % after 1  month and rest 25 % after 2  months. Crop yields were estimated from 3  m ×  3  m =  9  m 2 plots, and calculated into kg ha− 1.|$|R
30|$|The {{incorporation}} of humic complexes with nutritional action in plants, into the NPK granule, {{can be made}} through their incorporation either {{into one of the}} operational steps involved in the granule formation (I–III) or after granule stabilization in the conditioner drum. Although the latter option seems to be more adequate to prevent any decomposition of the molecules, many times it is not possible because it is very expensive due to the technology involved in it, and in many cases, the amount of humic mineral complexes needed to achieve intended results is too high to be applied by coating. In this sense, more than 1  % in the formula is normally not suitable to be applied as a coating. Then, regarding to the humic-derived molecules considered in this study, those related to micronutrients might be applied by coating (micronutrient concentration in compound fertilizer is rather low, mainly around 0.1  % referred to the micronutrient), while those involving major nutrients in fertilizer formula, such as macronutrients and even <b>secondary</b> <b>nutrients</b> (for instance, Ca and Mg), have to be applied in the granule mass during the granulation process.|$|R
