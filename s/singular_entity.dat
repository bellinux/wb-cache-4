25|$|Historically, {{various forms}} of Nontrinitarianism have {{appeared}} within Christianity. The term may refer to any belief {{about the nature of}} Jesus Christ that affirms God as a <b>singular</b> <b>entity</b> and rejects the doctrine of the Trinity, as affirmed by the mainstream Christianity: a consensus of Christian bishops at the First Council of Nicaea in 325. Nontrinitarianism was especially prevalent during the theological turmoils of the Protestant Reformation. A Spanish physician, Michael Servetus, studied the Bible and concluded that the concept of the Trinity, as traditionally conceived, was not biblical. His books On the Errors of the Trinity and Christianismi Restitutio caused much uproar. Servetus was eventually arrested, convicted of heresy, and burned at the stake in Geneva in 1553 under the order of John Calvin.|$|E

Historically, the notion of [...] "good" [...] as an absolute concept has emerged in parallel with the notion of God being the <b>singular</b> <b>entity</b> identified with good. In this sense, dystheism amounts to the abandonment of a central feature of historical monotheism: the de facto association of God with the summum bonum.|$|E

50|$|Whether W'rkncacnter is a <b>singular</b> <b>entity</b> or {{an alien}} race is unclear. Marathon 2: Durandal {{contains}} many mythological {{texts of the}} S'pht, but they are inconsistent on this point. It {{is possible that the}} W'rkncacnter is a race which is represented as a <b>singular</b> <b>entity</b> in the S'pht mythos, much like their mythological character Yrro has been speculated to be a singularization of the Jjaro. Durandal/Thoth in Marathon Infinity describes the legendary W'rkncacnter as having distinct identities. Another theory is that the W'rkncacnter is both a multiple and <b>singular</b> <b>entity,</b> in some incomprehensible way (possibly multiple manifestations of a single entity). Due to the contradictory descriptions, it is entirely plausible that the W'rkncacnter is a hive mind or functions in a fractal way, possessing multiple bodies/incarnations that can either act separately or as a single entity, and would be identical on any given scale. Given the being's chaotic nature, almost anything is possible.|$|E

40|$|A broadly {{applicable}} formulation {{for identifying}} control difficulties in positioning serial manipulators is developed {{based on the}} Implicit Function Theorem and a proposed acceleration analysis on singular surfaces. Internal singular surfaces upon which the manipulator exhibits control difficulties are determined in closed form and parameterized as a geometric entity with joint variables as parameters (these surfaces are called barriers). Difficulties in manipulator control are identified based on whether the end-effector admits motion normal to a singular surface. An indicator characterizing {{the difference between the}} component of acceleration in the normal direction and the centripetal acceleration on a singular surface yields a quadratic form. Definiteness properties of the quadratic form define directions of admissible output motion associated with a barrier.

40|$|Abstract. Oftentimes {{business}} processes exist not as <b>singular</b> <b>entities</b> {{that can be}} managed in isolation, but as families of variants {{that need to be}} managed together. When it comes to modelling these variants, analysts are faced with the dilemma of whether to model each variant separately or to model multiple or all variants as a single model. The former option leads to a proliferation of models that share common parts, leading to redundancy and possible inconsistency. The latter approach leads to less but more complex models, thus hindering on their comprehensibility. This paper presents a decomposition driven method to capture a family of process variants in a consolidated manner taking into account the above trade-off. We applied our method on a case study in the banking sector. A reduction of 50 % of duplication was achieved in this case study...|$|R
40|$|After briefly {{addressing}} {{the origin of}} the word ontology, I will ask what formal ontology might be. I will first argue that formal ontology {{is not the same as}} formalized or general ontology. In order to understand the meaning of the epithet "formal,â€?

Formal ontology will be shown to be formal insofar as it does not refer to concrete, <b>singular</b> <b>entities.</b> This implies that it cannot be the study of singular things, but also not the study of our knowledge of them. For in both cases, it would depend on empirical facts about concrete things. Rather, formal ontology is about the objectivity of objects, and in this sense, it is the study of the form that objects have only insofar as they are objects...|$|R

40|$|International audienceUsually a {{software}} product line (SPL) is developed by exploiting available resources {{of a set}} of software variants that deem similar. In order to reengineer such variants that are developed by ad-hoc reuse into software product line that are developed by systematic reuse, it is necessary to identify traceability links between features and source code in a collection of product variants. Information retrieval (IR) methods are used widely to achieve this goal. These methods handle product variants as <b>singular</b> <b>entities.</b> However when product variants are considered together, we can get additional information that improves IR results. This paper proposes an approach to improve IR results when they are applied to identify traceability links in a collection of product variants. The novelty of our approach is that we exploit commonality and variability across product variants at feature and implementation levels to apply IR methods in efficient way. The obtained results proved that our approach significantly outperforms direct applying IR technique in conventional way in term of precision and recall metrics...|$|R

Introduction In this paper we will consider a mass transit system in a regional area where both road and rail transportation may be used by commuters. Unlike the urban case [10], in a regional mass transit system, line frequencies are relatively low and trips can be considered as <b>singular</b> <b>entities.</b> We will assume that all the trips run on time according to a given time-table which is known by users; in addition, the vehicles have a fixed capacity (number of seats) which cannot be exceeded.
