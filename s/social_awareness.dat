5|$|Changing {{demographics}} {{and a growing}} <b>social</b> <b>awareness</b> led to increased political and architectural interest in providing cost-effective, sanitary, and comfortable residential space to the growing urban population {{in general and the}} working class in particular. This was known as boligsaken ("the housing cause") in Norwegian popular culture and continues to play a role to this day.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1980s, there were popular hip hop songs, and the celebrities of the scene, like LL Cool J, gained mainstream renown. Other performers experimented with politicized lyrics and <b>social</b> <b>awareness,</b> or fused hip hop with jazz, heavy metal, techno, funk and soul. New styles appeared {{in the latter part of}} the 1980s, like alternative hip hop and the closely related jazz rap fusion, pioneered by rappers like De La Soul.|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, {{research}} on awareness during online collaboration focused on {{topics such as}} the effects of spatial information about group members’ activities on the collaborative process. When the concept of awareness was introduced to computer-supported collaborative learning, this focus shifted to cognitive group awareness (e. g., information about group members’ knowledge and expertise) and <b>social</b> group <b>awareness</b> (e. g., information about group members’ contributions to the group process). In this article, we show how both cognitive and <b>social</b> group <b>awareness</b> affect coordination of collaborative activities in the content (e. g., cognitive learning activities) and relational space (e. g., maintaining a positive group climate) of collaboration. Furthermore, we describe how cognitive and <b>social</b> group <b>awareness</b> tools (i. e., tools designed to enhance cognitive or <b>social</b> group <b>awareness)</b> may help learners coordinate their activities in both spaces. We present a conceptual framework that shows how group awareness affects coordination in both dialogical spaces and the effectiveness of collaboration...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether explicit prior knowledge of the social loafing phenomenon,imparted through a specially designed <b>social</b> loafing <b>awareness</b> module, would reduce subsequent social loafing in a team cycle trial competition. Twenty-seven participants were tested individually for the distance covered in a 1 -minute cycle trial and then randomly assigned to either a control (n= 13) or intervention (n= 14) condition. The intervention group completed a 15 -minute <b>social</b> loafing <b>awareness</b> module consisting of a lecture and an educational video. Both groups completed a second 1 -minute cycle trial in teams. A 2 x 2 repeated measures ANOVA identified no interaction or main effects (p<. 05), suggesting that the module had not reduced social loafing significan tly in the intervention group. Further research is required that would incorporate identification of the initial levels of knowledge of social loafing and explicitly measure the increase in <b>social</b> loafing <b>awareness</b> following participation in the intervention module...|$|R
5|$|Folk-rock {{drew on the}} {{sporadic}} mainstream {{success of}} groups like the Kingston Trio and the Almanac Singers, while Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger helped to politically radicalize rural white folk music. The popular musician Bob Dylan rose to prominence {{in the middle of}} the 1960s, fusing folk with rock and making the nascent scene closely connected to the Civil Rights Movement. He was followed by a number of country-rock bands like The Byrds and the Flying Burrito Brothers and folk-oriented singer-songwriters like Joan Baez and the Canadian Joni Mitchell. However, by the end of the decade, there was little political or <b>social</b> <b>awareness</b> evident in the lyrics of pop-singer-songwriters like James Taylor and Carole King, whose self-penned songs were deeply personal and emotional.|$|E
5|$|The National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights (NCDHR) and the <b>Social</b> <b>Awareness</b> Society for Youths (SASY) {{surveyed}} 8,400 Dalit and non-Dalit {{families in}} 20 {{villages in the}} Cuddalore region in December 2015 and found that around 90 percent of the houses, livestock and crops destroyed in the floods belonged to Dalit families, who made {{up the majority of}} flood-displaced people. The final report alleged dominant caste people blocked access to clean water, medicines; official relief measures were concentrated in more accessible upper-caste neighbourhoods. On average, a majority of Dalit settlements were located only 1.5km from rivers, canals and the sea and most primary health centres were located in dominant caste neighbourhoods and were, on average, three km from Dalit settlements.|$|E
