40|$|AbstractObjectiveHigh {{homocysteine}} {{level is}} {{a risk factor for}} atherosclerosis and has been associated with lacunar infarcts (LIs), white matter lesions (WML) and cognitive dysfunction. It is unclear whether homocysteine is associated with cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) on top of pre-existent atherosclerosis. We evaluated the association between homocysteine and cSVD in a large cohort of patients with <b>symptomatic</b> <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>disease.</b> MethodsWithin the SMART-MR study, a prospective cohort study of patients with <b>symptomatic</b> <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>disease,</b> we estimated cross-sectional associations of total plasma homocysteine (THCY) and hyperhomocysteinemia (HHCY) with WML volume and presence of LI, using automated brain segmentation in MRIs of 1232 patients and cognitive function in 763 patients. WML were expressed as a logarithmic transformed percentage of total brain volume. ResultsLinear regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, vascular risk factors and extent of atherosclerosis showed that THCY and HHCY were significantly associated with larger WML volumes (B= 0. 01 %: 95 % CI 0. 002 – 0. 02 %, and B= 0. 21 %: 95 % CI 0. 04 – 0. 39 %). Increasing THCY was significantly associated with an increased risk of LIs (OR 1. 04, 95 % CI 1. 01 – 1. 07, per 1 μmol). Moreover, HHCY was associated with worse cognitive function (B=− 0. 12 : 95 % CI − 0. 22 to − 0. 01).

40|$|Background: A dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and {{sympathetic}} nervous system in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) has been noted in numerous studies. A recent study has highlighted that the ratio of reactive salivary alpha amylase to salivary cortisol (AOC) {{may be a better}} indicator of MDD than either biomarker alone 1. Yet no studies thus far have examined whether this ratio can be used with baseline values instead of reactive measurements. This study will investigate the relationship between MDD or depressive symptoms and baseline AOC in patients with <b>symptomatic</b> <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>disease.</b> Methods: Data for this study was gathered from the SMART-Medea study, consisting of 614 subjects with <b>symptomatic</b> <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>disease.</b> Detailed information was gathered on MDD status, through the Patient Health Questionnaire- 9 (PHQ- 9) and the Composites International Depression Interview. Samples of salivary alpha amylase and salivary cortisol were taken at several time points in a single day 2. The SMART-Medea study gathered detailed demographic and lifestyle information allowing for extensive use of demographic, sampling, lifestyle and medication covariate use in this study. This study firstly examined the relationship between PHQ- 9 score and AOC through a linear regression analysis. Secondly the difference in AOC values among the three MDD groups (no MDD, subthreshold MDD and MDD) was gathered through an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA). Results: The linear regression with adjustments for age, gender, level of education, smoking, stress, alcohol use, and medication use showed that PHQ- 9 score had a significant positive association with AOC at the time points 45 minutes after awakening and 60 minutes after awakening. The other time points do not show a significant association between PHQ- 9 score and AOC. Results of the ANCOVA do not show a significant difference in AOC among the no MDD, subthreshold and MDD group for any of the time points or the area under the curve values. Conclusion: This study is the first to study the effects of MDD and MDD symptoms on the ratio of baseline salivary alpha amylase to salivary cortisol in subjects with <b>symptomatic</b> <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>disease.</b> Results {{of this study indicate that}} AOC is associated with PHQ- 9, as a marker for MDD symptom expression, at several time points during the day.

We assessed whether DM increased the rate of progression of brain atrophy, vascular brain lesions, and cognitive decline in patients with <b>symptomatic</b> <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>disease.</b> MethodsIn 663 patients (58 ± 10 years) from the SMART-MR study (n= 89 with DM), 1. 5 T MRI and neuropsychological examination were performed at baseline and after 3. 9 ± 0. 4 years follow-up. ResultsRepeated measures ANCOVA (adjusted for age, sex, and vascular risk factors) showed that patients with DM had smaller total brain volume (mean differences as percentage of intracranial volume (ICV) [95 % CI]: − 1. 36 % [− 1. 81; − 0. 91]), smaller gray matter volume (− 1. 23 % [− 1. 85; − 0. 61]), larger ventricular volume (0. 32 % [0. 14; 0. 49]), and larger white matter lesion volume (0. 31 % [0. 09; 0. 53]) than patients without DM. Patients with DM had accelerated increase in ventricular volume over time compared with patients without DM (mean differences ventricular volume as percentage of ICV: 0. 32 % [0. 25; 0. 39] vs. 0. 17 % [0. 15; 0. 19]; p-interaction DM×time< 0. 01).

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} whether severity and progression of periventricular and deep white matter lesions (WML) and lacunar infarcts {{were associated with}} progression of brain atrophy. Methods: Within the SMART-MR study, a prospective cohort on MRI changes in patients with <b>symptomatic</b> <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>disease,</b> 565 patients (57 +/- 9 years) without large infarcts had vascular screening and 1. 5 T MRI at baseline and after a mean follow-up of 3. 9 years. With automated brain segmentation, total brain, cortical gray matter, ventricular, and WML volumes were estimated and expressed relative to intracranial volume (%). Lacunar infarcts were rated manually. Results: Using linear regression analyses adjusted for demographics and vascular risk factors, periventricular WML volume at baseline was associated with greater decrease in cortical gray matter volume (B = - 1. 73 %, 95 % confidence interval [CI] - 3. 15 % to - 0. 30 %, per 1 % WML volume increase) and greater increase in ventricular volume (B = 0. 12 %, 95 % CI 0. 04 % to 0. 20 %). Progression of periventricular WML volume corresponded with a greater decrease in cortical gray matter volume (B = - 0. 45 %, 95 % CI - 0. 9 % to 0 %) and greater increase in ventricular volume (B = 0. 15 %, 95 % CI 0. 1 % to 0. 2 %). Presence of lacunar infarcts was associated with greater decline in total brain volume (B = - 0. 25 %, 95 % CI - 0. 49 % to - 0. 01 %) and progression of lacunar infarcts with a greater decrease of total brain (B = - 0. 30 %, 95 % CI - 0. 59 % to 0. 01 %) and cortical gray matter volume (B = - 0. 81 %, 95 % CI - 1. 43 % to - 0. 20 %).

(1). Platelet activation in patients with stable coronary heart disease increases with the angiographic severity of disease. (2). Patients presenting with the acute manifestations of atherosclerosis have a greater degree of platelet activation than patients with stable disease. (3). Peripheral artery intervention results in the release of the cytokine, sCD 40 L, by platelets. (4). Platelet microparticle levels are higher in patients with Type 2 Diabetes who develop symptomatic macrovascular disease.;Using both flow cytometric and Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) based measurements of platelet activation, this thesis confirms that platelet activation can be related to the clinical severity of atherosclerotic disease. In addition, the development of <b>symptomatic</b> <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>disease</b> is associated with increased platelet microparticle levels. Peripheral artery angioplasty has also been shown to increase sCD 40 L release.

Methods: In a prospective cohort of patients with <b>symptomatic</b> <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>disease,</b> the authors performed retinal photographs and brain MRI. Two ophthalmologists, {{not aware of the}} MR results, independently assessed retinal arterial narrowing, crossings, sclerosis, and tortuosity according to standard scoring lists. Two observers independently assessed white matter lesions (WML) and lacunar infarcts on the MR images. Lesions were considered abnormal only when both ophthalmologists or MR raters agreed. Cerebral SVD was defined as the presence of WML or lacunar infarcts. Results: In 179 patients, retinal photographs and brain MRI were performed. Of the 108 patients with MR signs of SVD, 92 % had at least one retinal vascular abnormality; of the 71 patients without SVD, 77 % had retinal pathology (p < 0. 01). All types of retinal vascular pathology occurred more frequently in patients with SVD, but only retinal arterial narrowing and sclerosis differed significantly. In the 109 normotensive patients, the presence of any retinal vascular change correlated with signs of SVD (p = 0. 01).

40|$|In {{the first}} two years after stroke {{approximately}} one-third of the patients suffer from depression, also referred to as post-stroke depression (PSD). Patients with PSD suffer from symptoms, such as a diminished interest or pleasure (anhedonia), depressed mood, sleep disturbances, loss of energy, changes in appetite, feelings of inappropriate guilt, concentration difficulties, psychomotor retardation or agitation, and suicidal thoughts. PSD aggravates the burden of physical, psychological and social disability after a stroke and hinders patient participation in rehabilitation. Therefore, the timely recognition and diagnosis of PSD is essential for the optimization of patient recovery from stroke. In this thesis, first, the role of nurses in the daily care of depressed stroke patients is studied in a systematic literature review, focusing on the early detection of PSD and therapeutic interventions that they can use. The findings showed that nurses distinguished a screening role from an intervening role. They recognized symptoms of depression, however, they experienced the assessment of psychological status as difficult {{because of a lack of}} knowledge, skills, and training. Measurement scales supporting their observations were seldom used. We also investigated the clinical manifestation of PSD as compared to patients with <b>symptomatic</b> <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>diseases</b> other than stroke or with patients in general practice. The findings demonstrated broadly similar symptom profiles in the three cohorts, showing that PSD is not a different type of depression. However, the stroke patients suffered more severely from these symptoms than the patients with other <b>symptomatic</b> <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>diseases</b> or the patients in general practice. Subsequently, the clinimetric properties of the 9 -item and the 2 -item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ- 9, PHQ- 2) were investigated in daily nursing practice of hospitalized patients with stroke able to communicate adequately. The inter-rater reliability, the test re-test reliability and the internal consistency of the PHQ- 9 were shown to be good. Nurses judged the PHQ- 9 to be a brief and easy-to-use instrument in daily practice of nursing stroke care. The PHQ- 9 performed best at a score ≥­ 10 and the PHQ- 2 at a score ≥ 2. Administering the PHQ- 9 only to patients who scored ≥­ 2 on the PHQ- 2 improved the identification of depression. The timely detection of PSD, however, is complicated by a decrease in the length of hospital stay, resulting in a large proportion of patients who are discharged within two weeks after stroke. Therefore, we developed and validated the Post-Stroke Depression Prediction Scale (DePreS). This prediction rule enables clinicians to estimate the degree of the depression risk for an individual patient within the first week after stroke. The prediction could be used as the basis for a more selective screening process for PSD. In conclusion, to decrease the burden of PSD and the negative impact on patients' recovery health care providers, such as nurses, taking care of patients with stroke should use valid and reliable assessment tools in order to detect PSD, which needs to be followed by effective and efficient treatment...|$|R

Conclusion Constituting an indication for surgical correction, his condition was managed with the performance of carotid-carotid extra-anatomic bypass for the permanent reestablishment of antegrade blood flow in the vascular network supplying the brain. Carotid-carotid extra-anatomic bypass was a good option for our patient, since he remains symptom free after one year of follow up. </p...|$|R

40|$|While {{the risk}} for <b>symptomatic</b> <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>disease</b> {{increases}} after menopause, currently recognized risk factors do not identify ongoing disease processes in low-risk women. This study tested the hypothesis that circulating cell-derived microparticles may reflect disease processes in women defined as low risk by the Framingham risk score. The concentration and phenotype of circulating microparticles were evaluated in a cross-sectional study of apparently healthy menopausal women, screened for enrollment into the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study. Microparticles were evaluated by flow cytometry, and coronary artery calcification (CAC) was scored using 64 -slice computed tomography scanners. The procoagulant activity of isolated microparticles was determined with a sensitive fluorescent thrombin generation assay. Chronological age, body mass index, serum lipids, systolic blood pressure (Framingham risk score 50; range, 93 – 315 Agatston units) CAC compared with women without calcification. The total concentration and percentage of microparticles derived from platelets and endothelial cells were greatest in women with high CAC scores. The thrombin-generating capacity of the isolated microparticles correlated with phosphatidylserine expression, which also was greatest in women with high CAC scores. The percentages of microparticles expressing granulocyte and monocyte markers {{were not significantly different}} among groups. Therefore, the characterization of platelet and endothelial microparticles may identify early menopausal women with premature CAC who would not otherwise be identified by the usual risk factor analysis...|$|E
40|$|Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) is a multifactorial {{syndrome}} {{that most}} commonly affects people over 60 years of age. With {{the aging of}} the population, the prevalence of atherosclerotic disease and its associated adverse outcomes will increase. It has to be noted that the process of established atherothrombosis is not limited to a single arterial location, giving it the character of a systemic and generalized disease. The Reduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health (REACH) registry demonstrated that one out of six patients with (i) PAD, (ii) cerebrovascular disease, or (iii) coronary artery disease had involvement of one or two other arterial beds. Importantly, the presence of multiple affected arterial territories, called polyvascular disease, has been demonstrated to be an independent predictor of long-term cardiovascular outcome in the general population. In response to studies demonstrating the adverse prognosis of atherosclerotic disease, the need for adequate risk factor stratification and reduction has emerged. The importance of risk factor reduction in patients with PAD has resulted in universally recommended atherothrombotic risk factor reduction, with the objective of decreasing the high incidence of heart disease and cerebrovascular disease associated with PAD. In patients with PAD scheduled for vascular surgery, risk factor stratification is directed at the detection of (a) <b>symptomatic</b> <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>disease</b> in other vascular beds than the primary symptomatic arterial location. Early detection of polyvascular atherosclerotic disease has important consequences for risk factor reduction strategies, including life-style interventions and medical therapy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract__ Atherosclerosis is a {{progressive}} {{disease of the}} large and medium-sized arteries. The disease is characterised by endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and the accumulation of fatty and fibrous substances in the vessel wall, resulting in thickening and loss of elasticity of the arteries. The word atherosclerosis has been derived from the Greek words "athera", porridge or gruel, and "skleros", hard or stiff. These words describe the external features of the lipid-loaded lesions that characterize the disease. Although atherosclerosis has been discovered in blood vessels of people living more than 3000 years ago, {{until the end of}} the 18 th century its prevalence was very rare. During the 20 th century, mortality caused by atherosclerosis strongly increased. Nowadays, complications of atherosclerosis are the main cause of death in the developed world, and are predicted to be the leading cause of death worldwide by the year 2020 (Fonarow, 2007). It is difficult to accurately determine the true frequency of atherosclerosis because it is a predominantly asymptomatic condition (Kavey et al., 2006). Early atherosclerotic lesions can already be found in the aorta shortly after birth, increasing in number during childhood. More advanced lesions begin to develop at an age of approximately 25 years. Generally, the clinical manifestations of the disease become apparent in the sixth decade of life. <b>Symptomatic</b> <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>disease</b> most often involves the arteries supplying the heart, brain, kidneys, and lower extremities, and becomes apparent when arterial blood flow is obstructed.

Recent advances in medical and endovascular therapy have placed ICAD at the forefront of clinical stroke research to optimize the best medical and endovascular approach to treat this important underlying stroke etiology. Analysis of symptomatic ICAD studies lead to the question that whether angioplasty and/or stenting is a safe, suitable, and efficacious therapeutic strategy in patients with critical stenoses that are deemed refractory to medical management.

In this study, we evaluate our results with brachial artery reconstruction in patients who present with <b>symptomatic</b> <b>atherosclerotic</b> occlusive <b>disease</b> and compare this cohort's demographics with a similar group with lower extremity ischemia. Methods: From 1986 to 1998, all patients presenting for upper extremity revascularization with chronic ischemia were prospectively entered into a vascular registry. Demographics, indications, outcomes, and patency were recorded. Patients presenting with embolus, pseudoaneurysm, or trauma were excluded. The Fisher exact and Student t tests {{were used to assess}} significance. Results: Fifty-one (83 %) bypass grafts were performed with autogenous conduit and the remainder with polytetrafluoroethylene. Indications included 18 (30 %) patients with exertional arm pain, 35 (57 %) with rest pain, and 8 (13 %) with tissue loss. Twenty-five (45 %) patients were male, 8 (14 %) had diabetes, and 30 (54 %) were smokers. The mean age was 58 years (range, 33 - 93). The operative mortality rate was 1. 8 %, and follow-up ranged from 1 to 140 months. Eight occlusions were identified, with six occurring early. Five of these were in women with a smoking history. Only one of the 26 reconstructions that did not cross a joint occluded, whereas bypass grafts that did cross a joint occluded more frequently. No other major complications were recognized. Conclusion: Arm revascularization for ischemia can be performed with reasonable mortality and morbidity rates. These patients may represent a different subgroup of <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>disease</b> than those with lower extremity involvement: they are more commonly women and smokers and less likely to be diabetic.

40|$|Clopidogrel is a {{recently}} introduced platelet ADP receptor antagonist, {{belonging to the}} thienopyridine derivatives, like its analogue ticlopidine. Its potential advantage is to be safer than ticlopidine. At 75 mg/od clopidogrel significantly inhibits platelet aggregation in ambulatory patients with <b>symptomatic</b> <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>disease</b> and it prevents the recurrence of ischemic events more efficiently than aspirin. Its adequate dose in more acute situations remained to be determined. Therefore, sixty two patients with coronary artery disease were randomly assigned in four groups treated, within 24 h after coronary artery bypass graft, by clopidogrel 50 mg/od, 75 mg/od or 100 mg/od or by ticlopidine 250 mg/bid which was considered as the reference. The tolerance of clopidogrel was fairly good during the whole period of the study. Bleeding time and ex-vivo platelet aggregation induced by ADP 2 microM and 5 microM were performed at day - 1, + 9 and + 28 after surgery. Like ticlopidine, the three dose levels of clopidogrel significantly inhibited ex-vivo platelet activity and prolonged the bleeding time at day 28. However, unlike ticlopidine, the inhibitory effects of clopidogrel were not significant at day 9, especially with 75 mg/od, a dose which was found to significantly protect patients in a chronic situation. Hence, although the clinical outcome for patients included in this limited study was {{the same in the}} four groups, these results suggest that the dose regime of clopidogrel should be more extensively investigated during the early period following coronary artery bypass graft, facing an overproduction of young and hyperreactive platelets. By analogy, the dose regime should be also investigated in other situations with an acute risk of arterial thrombotic occlusion. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Chronic {{exposure}} {{to high levels}} of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) might increase the risk of hypertensive cardiovascular events. However, little data are available on the association of direct measures of ACE activity with vascular risk and disease. We examined whether serum ACE levels were associated with the risk of recurrent vascular events. Methods: Within the SMART-MR study, a prospective cohort study among patients with <b>symptomatic</b> <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>disease,</b> analyses were performed in 950 patients (mean age 58 ± 10 years) without use of ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers. At baseline, participants underwent a vascular screening and serum ACE levels (U/L) were measured. Patients were followed for recurrent vascular events, including vascular death, ischemic stroke, and ischemic coronary heart disease (CHD). Results: After a mean follow up of 7. 2 years (range 0. 2 - 10. 1 years), we documented 55 cases of vascular death, 33 cases of ischemic stroke, and 77 cases of ischemic CHD. Multivariable Cox-regression models showed that higher baseline ACE levels were associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke and CHD; HR's (95 %CI) were 1. 7 (1. 0 - 2. 7) and 1. 8 (1. 2 - 2. 9). High ACE particularly increased risk of stroke in patients with high blood pressure (defined as > 140 / 90 mmHg) (HR = 4. 8; 95 %CI 1. 0 - 19. 4). This relation was independent of several confounders including use of antihypertensive medication. Serum ACE was not significantly associated with risk of vascular death. Conclusion: Our results suggest that in a population with high vascular risk, higher serum ACE levels contribute to an increased risk of ischemic stroke and CHD events. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Atherosclerosis is exaggerated in African American (AA) {{systemic}} {{lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) patients, with doubled cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk compared to White patients. The extent to which common Apolipoprotein L 1 (APOL 1) risk alleles (RA) contribute to this trend is unknown. This retrospective cohort study assessed prevalent atherosclerotic disease across APOL 1 genotypes in AA SLE patients. One hundred thirteen AA SLE subjects were APOL 1 -genotyped and stratified as having: zero risk alleles, one risk allele, or two risk alleles. Chart review assessed CVD manifestations including abdominal aortic aneurysm, angina, carotid artery disease, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, and vascular calcifications. Associations between the genotypes and a composite endpoint defined as one or more CVD manifestations were calculated using logistic regression. <b>Symptomatic</b> <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>disease,</b> excluding incidental vascular calcifications, was also assessed. The 0 -risk-allele, 1 -risk-allele and 2 -risk-allele groups, respectively, comprised 34 %, 53 %, and 13 % of the cohort. Respectively, 13. 2 %, 41. 7 %, and 60. 0 % of the 0 -risk allele, 1 -risk-allele, and 2 -risk-allele groups met the composite endpoint of atherosclerotic CVD (p = 0. 001). Adjusting for risk factors-including smoking, ESRD, BMI > 25 and hypertension-we observed an association between carrying one or more RA and atherosclerotic CVD (OR = 7. 1; p = 0. 002). For symptomatic disease, the OR was 3. 5 (p = 0. 02). In a time-to-event analysis, the proportion of subjects free from the composite primary endpoint, symptomatic atherosclerotic CVD, was higher in the 0 -risk-allele group compared to the 1 -risk-allele and 2 -risk-allele groups (χ 2 = 6. 5; p = 0. 04).

40|$|Intracranial {{atherosclerosis}} {{is considered}} a cause of approximately 8 % of all strokes in the western society. However, its frequency is much higher in Asian countries. In our hospital-based study, among the patients who had angiographic abnormalities, the frequency of intracranial atherosclerosis was approximately 70 % far exceeding that of extratracranial atherosclerosis. <b>Symptomatic</b> <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>diseases</b> were most often found in the middle cerebral artery. Generally, {{it has been shown}} that obesity and hyperlipidemia are related to extracranial diseases while advance hypertension is associated with intracranial diseases. However, these results have not always been replicated, and certain genetic factors may be related with the ethnic differences in the location of atherosclerosis. Recent studies using diffusion weighted MRI showed that the main mechanisms of stroke in patients with intracranial atherosclerosis are the branch occlusion, artery to artery embolism and both. The intracranial stenosis, especially symptomatic one, is not a static condition and may progress or regress in a relatively short period of time. Progressive stenosis of intracranial arteries is clearly related to the development of ischemic events. The annual risk of stroke relevant to the stenosed intracranial vessel is approximately 8 %. In retrospective studies including ASID, anticoagulation was found to be superior to aspirin in reducing the stroke events. However, a recent prospective study failed to confirm the superiority of anticoagulation over aspirin in patients with intracranial stenosis. Moreover, anticoagulation resulted in excessive central nervous system bleeding as compared to aspirin. Because aspirin alone seems to be insufficient in the prevention of progression of intracranial stenosis, a combination of antiplatelets has been tried. Recently, we found that a combination of aspirin + cilostazol was superior to aspirin monotherapy in the prevention of progression of symptomatic intracranial stenosis. However, further studies are required to find out the best combination of antiplatelets for symptomatic intracranial stenosis. The effect of other atheroma stabilizers such as statins should also be properly evaluated. Angioplasty/stent is another important option for the relatively severe intracranial stenosis. According to previous studies, immediate success rate has reached up to 90 %. If patients are carefully selected, and procedures done by experienced hand, angioplasty/stent can be of benefit especially in relatively young patients with proximal, short-segment, severe symptomatic stenosis. However, this procedure is not without complications or long-term re-stenosis. Further studies are required to elucidate the best therapeutic strategy in patients with intracranial atherosclerosis...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: <b>Symptomatic</b> <b>atherosclerotic</b> {{occlusive}} <b>disease</b> of the innominate artery is {{a threatening}} disease pattern {{that offers a}} major challenge in achieving definitive surgical repair. To assess the evolution of treatment strategies and their outcomes for this disease, the authors undertook {{a review of the}} cumulative experience for more than 3 decades at one institution. METHODS: Between 1960 and 1997, 94 patients (mean age, 62 years) underwent direct innominate artery revascularization for occlusive <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>disease</b> to relieve neurologic (n = 85) and/or right upper extremity (n = 26) symptoms or asymptomatic critical stenosis (n = 3). The pattern of atherosclerotic involvement revealed by angiography included critical stenosis (n = 77), complete occlusion (n = 10), and moderate stenosis with plaque ulceration (n = 7). A common brachiocephalic trunk was present in five patients. Transsternal (n = 68) or transcervical (n = 4) innominate endarterectomy was performed in 72 patients and bypass grafting in 22. Forty-one patients underwent concomitant endarterectomy or bypass of innominate branches or adjacent arch vessels, and 3 had coronary bypass grafting. RESULTS: There were three perioperative deaths (3 %), all due to cardiac causes. Postoperative morbidity included four strokes (three resolved), two myocardial infarctions, two transient ischemic attacks, and one sternal dehiscence. Follow-up ranged from 8 months to 20 years. Postoperative actuarial survival rate was 96 % at 1 year, 85 % at 5 years, and 67 % at 10 years. Freedom from recurrence requiring reoperation was 100 % at 1 year, 99 % at 5 years, and 97 % at 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: Innominate artery reconstruction is safe and durable when either endarterectomy or prosthetic bypass is used. The anatomic variation and disease distribution permit endarterectomy for most patients. The technique of innominate endarterectomy can be extended safely to outflow and adjacent vessels...|$|R
