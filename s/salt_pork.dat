5|$|Medieval {{society was}} highly stratified. In {{a time when}} famine was commonplace and social {{hierarchies}} were often brutally enforced, food was an important marker of social status {{in a way that}} has no equivalent today in most developed countries. According to the ideological norm, society consisted of the three estates of the realm: commoners, that is, the working classes—by far the largest group; the clergy, and the nobility. The relationship between the classes was strictly hierarchical, with the nobility and clergy claiming worldly and spiritual overlordship over commoners. Within the nobility and clergy there were also a number of ranks ranging from kings and popes to dukes, bishops and their subordinates, such as priests. One was expected to remain in one's social class and to respect the authority of the ruling classes. Political power was displayed not just by rule, but also by displaying wealth. Nobles dined on fresh game seasoned with exotic spices, and displayed refined table manners; rough laborers could make do with coarse barley bread, <b>salt</b> <b>pork</b> and beans and were not expected to display etiquette. Even dietary recommendations were different: the diet of the upper classes was considered to be as much a requirement of their refined physical constitution as a sign of economic reality. The digestive system of a lord was held to be more discriminating than that of his rustic subordinates and demanded finer foods.|$|E

Washing clothes and children was typically done at night by moonlight, after tying up the boat, {{along the side of}} the canal. Food and provisions for the trip (e.g. flour, sugar, coffee, <b>salt</b> <b>pork,</b> smoked meat, etc.) were bought in Cumberland on Wineow street, from stores such as Coulehan's, Dennis Murphy's, or John McGrinnis's. Some boatmen carried chickens or pigs on the boats. Fish caught in the canal also served as food, as well as turtles. Additional supplies could be bought along the way from lockkeepers and at towns.|$|E

Dried salted meat is one of the main meat products typically produced with a variety of flavors and textures. Neck (14  samples) and ham (14 samples) was salted by nitrite salt mixture during 1 week.

25|$|Before Ariel {{had even}} crossed {{the bar of}} the Min River, Captain Keay had the crew working on the fore and aft trim of the ship, a process that {{continued}} for over two weeks. Adjustments were needed later in the voyage as stores and water were used. The loaded draft of 18 feet 8 inches forward and 18 feet 3 inches aft was eventually altered to 18 feet 1 inch forward and 18 feet 3 inches aft by moving some of the cargo into the after cabin, and generally moving aft any heavy movable material such as hawsers, casks of <b>salt</b> <b>pork,</b> and spare spars. This improved the steering and general sailing performance. Adjusting the trim went on against the continual background of sail trimming, setting and taking in sails, maintenance work and repairs.|$|E

[...] Willis' Bank Note List stated that [...] "there is no probability of them ever getting into general circulation; they are altogether too small." [...] The North Carolina Standard hoped {{that they would be}} struck at the Charlotte Mint and circulated locally to eliminate the problem of small-denomination bank notes from out of state. Coin dealer and numismatic author Q.

500|$|The British {{army was}} {{initially}} deployed from posts {{as far north}} as Hackensack to New Brunswick. [...] The garrison, numbering about 10,000, was concentrated between New Brunswick and Amboy, with a sizable contingent farther north, from Elizabethtown to Paulus Hook. [...] Militia pressure in January led General Cornwallis to withdraw most of the northern troops to the shores of the Hudson. [...] The resulting concentration of troops overflowed the available housing, which had been entirely abandoned by its residents, with some of the troops even living aboard ships anchored nearby; the cramped quarters led to an increase in camp-related illnesses throughout the winter, and morale was low. [...] The area had been heavily plundered during the American retreat in the fall, so there was {{little in the way of}} local provisions. [...] The men subsisted largely on rations such as <b>salt</b> <b>pork,</b> but their draft animals required fresh fodder, for which they sent out raiding expeditions.|$|E
500|$|The British {{began to}} awaken their troops at 9 pm {{on the night}} of April 18 and {{assembled}} them on the water's edge on the western end of Boston Common by 10 pm. Colonel Smith was late in arriving, and there was no organized boat-loading operation, resulting in confusion at the staging area. [...] The boats used were naval barges that were packed so tightly that there was no room to sit down. When they disembarked near Phipps Farm in Cambridge, it was into waist-deep water at midnight. After a lengthy halt to unload their gear, the regulars began their [...] march to Concord at about 2 am. During the wait they were provided with extra ammunition, cold <b>salt</b> <b>pork,</b> and hard sea biscuits. They did not carry knapsacks, since they would not be encamped. They carried their haversacks (food bags), canteens, muskets, and accoutrements, and marched off in wet, muddy shoes and soggy uniforms. As they marched through Menotomy, sounds of the colonial alarms throughout the countryside caused the few officers who were aware of their mission to realize they had lost the element of surprise.|$|E

2500|$|Randolph B. Marcy, an Army {{officer who}} wrote a 1859 guide, advised taking less bacon than the earlier guides had recommended.

Marcy instructed emigrants to put <b>salt</b> <b>pork</b> on the bottom of wagons to avoid exposure to extreme heat. Marcy also recommended the use of pemmican, as well as the storage of sugar in India-rubber or gutta-percha sacks, to prevent it from becoming wet.|$|E
2500|$|Bacon is {{distinguished}} from <b>salt</b> <b>pork</b> and ham by {{differences in the}} brine or dry packing. Bacon brine has added curing ingredients, most notably sodium nitrite, and occasionally potassium nitrate (saltpeter), but sodium ascorbate or erythorbate may also be added to accelerate curing and stabilise colour. Flavourings such as brown sugar or maple syrup are used for some bacon products. Sodium polyphosphates, such as sodium triphosphate, may also be added to make the product easier to slice and to reduce spattering when the bacon is pan-fried. Today, a brine specifically for ham includes {{a large amount of}} sugar. Historically, the terms [...] "ham" [...] and [...] "bacon" [...] referred to different cuts of meat that were brined or packed identically, often together in the same barrel.|$|E

The barnacles were exhausted by mid-April, but the survivors managed to catch additional fish.

2500|$|The term [...] "Creole music" [...] {{is used to}} {{describe}} both the early folk or roots music traditions of French and Metis rural Creoles of South Louisiana and the later more contemporary genre called Zydeco.
