40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the applicability of}} metal spray coating as a waterproofing/corrosion protection method for a concrete structure used for water purification. We carried out an ozone resistance test on four metal sprays and {{evaluated the}} water permeability and bond strength of the metals with superior ozone resistance, depending on the surface treatment method. In the ozone resistance test, four metal sprays and an existing ozone-proof paint were considered. In the experiment on the water permeability and bond strength depending on the surface treatment method, the methods of no treatment, surface polishing, and two types of pore sealing agents were considered. The {{results showed that the}} sprayed titanium had the best ozone resistance. Applying a pore <b>sealing</b> <b>agent</b> provided the best adhesion performance, of about 3. 2 MPa. Applying a pore <b>sealing</b> <b>agent</b> also provided the best waterproofing performance. Scanning electron microscope analysis showed that applying a pore <b>sealing</b> <b>agent</b> resulted in an excellent waterproofing performance because a coating film formed on top of the metal spray coating. Thus, when using a metal spray as waterproofing/corrosion protection for a water treatment concrete structure, applying a pore <b>sealing</b> <b>agent</b> on top of a film formed by spraying titanium was concluded to be the most appropriate method...|$|E
40|$|A novel organic-inorganic hybrid {{material}} of γ-methacryloxypropyltrime-thoxysilane (KH 570) -SiO₂ was fabricated by Sol-Gel method. The hybrid material {{was used as}} the <b>sealing</b> <b>agent</b> for the plasma sprayed Al₂O₃- 13 wt. % TiO₂ coating. Infrared spectrum and grafted mechanism of the hybrid agent (HA) were studied. Moreover, morphology and porosity, as well as characteristics of immersion plus electrochemical corrosion in acid environment of the coating with and without sealing treatment were evaluated, compared with those of the coating sealed with the conventional silicone resin agent (SRA). The results reveal that KH 570 was successfully grafted onto the surface of SiO₂. The HA film sealed {{on the surface of the}} coating presents a little better quality than the SRA film. The porosities of the coatings after the sealing treatment decreased. Furthermore, the sealing treatment can improve efficiently the corrosion resistance of the coating in 5 vol. % HCl solution.

40|$|In this research, we {{investigated}} the cytotoxic mechanisms {{of one of}} the widely used pharmaceuticals that are regularly associated with the adverse effects on the liver, sometimes leading to acute liver failure, diclofenac. Diclofenac liver cytotoxicity was associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and lipid peroxidation which were inhibited by antioxidants and ROS scavengers, ferric chelator, inhibitors of reduced CYP 2 E 1 and CYP 2 C 9, mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore <b>sealing</b> <b>agents</b> and endocytosis inhibitors. Incubation of hepatocytes with diclofenac caused rapid hepatocyte glutathione (GSH) depletion which is another marker of cellular oxidative stress. Most of the diclofenac-induced GSH depletion could be attributed to the expulsion of GSSG. Diclofenac cytotoxicity was also associated with mitochondrial injury, lysosomal membrane rupture and release of digestive proteases which were prevented by antioxidants, MPT pore <b>sealing</b> <b>agents,</b> lysosomotropic agents and inhibitors of cytochrome P 450 isoenzymes. These events could cause cytochrome C release from the mitochondrial intramembrane space to cytosol. The cytochrome C release could trigger activation of caspase- 3 and apoptosis. We finally concluded that diclofenac hepatotoxicity is a result of metabolic activation by CYP 2 E 1 and CYP 2 C 9 and ROS formation, leading to a mitochondrial/lysosomal toxic cross-talk in the liver hepatocytes...|$|R

Methods: Pigs underwent laparotomy and partial resection of the left medial liver lobe. A 16 -Ch silicon catheter was introduced into the common bile duct. Pigs were randomly assigned to 2 groups (n = 4 each). In group 1, TachoSil was applied on the resection surface, and in group 2 Tissucol was applied. After 2 h, pressure in the intrabiliary system was gradually increased. Results: No significant differences in the hemostasis times between TachoSil and Tissucol were observed (210. 0 +/- 12. 9 vs. 208. 8 +/- 14. 2 s; p = 0. 9506). The pressure that could be resisted with Tissucol was significantly lower compared to TachoSil (77. 0 +/- 8. 6 vs. 131. 8 +/- 16. 3 mm Hg; p = 0. 0405). Conclusions: The application of TachoSil on the resection surface is equally effective in obtaining hemostasis and in sealing of biliary ducts as Tissucol.

The process, known as the tape casting, involves the suspension consisting of solvents and binders.

Initial CaCO 3 precipitate forms close to isotopic equilibrium with dissolved inorganic carbon. Subsequent precipitation occurs at - 2 to - 3 parts per thousand offset from isotopic equilibrium, suggesting that the initial delta C- 13 value of CaCO 3 is reset through dissolution followed by reprecipitation with urease molecules {{playing a role in}} offsetting the delta C- 13 value of CaCO 3 from isotopic equilibrium.

Fifty percent of the {{permanent}} molars are decayed {{by the age of}} 12, due to lack of information about protection and occlusal morphology. Pit and fissure sealing undoubtedly plays a fundamental role in preventing occlusal caries. The most common approach to assess the sealing ability of pit and fissure sealants of tooth/restoration is the measurement of dye penetration along the interface. Aims and Objectives: The present study aims to evaluate the microleakage and penetration depth of three different types of dental materials, namely (A) Conventional pit and fissure sealant, (B) Flowable composite, (C) Flowable nanocomposite. Study Design: This in-vitro comparative study comprised of extracted human posterior teeth mounted as blocks. Materials and Methods: In the present study, microleakage and penetration depths of conventional sealants/flowable composite and nanocomposite were measured {{with the help of a}} dye under stereomicroscope. Statistical Analysis: A student′t′ test and Analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were performed to compare the mean microleakage and penetration depth. Results: Microleakage was found to be highest for the flowable composites, and least for the conventional sealant. The nanocomposite values were intermediate. Penetration depth was highest for nanocomposite and least for flowable composite. Conclusions: According to the results, the nanocomposite was found to be an excellent dental material for penetration in deep pits and fissures, though it exhibits mild microleakage.

40|$|Purpose: Depression is {{a public}} {{disorder}} worldwide. Despite {{the widespread use of}} venlafaxine in the treatment of depression, it has been associated with the incidence of toxicities. Hence, the goal of the current investigation was to evaluate the mechanisms of venlafaxine–induced cell death in the model of the freshly isolated rat hepatocytes. Methods: Collagenase-perfused rat hepatocytes were treated with venlafaxine and other agents. Cell damage, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial membrane potential decline, lysosomal damage, glutathione (GSH) level were analyzed. Moreover, rat liver mitochondria were isolated through differential centrifugation to assess respiratory chain functionality. Results: Our results demonstrated that venlafaxine could induce ROS formation followed by lipid peroxidation, cellular GSH content depletion, elevated GSSG level, loss of lysosmal membrane integrity, MMP collapse and finally cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. N-acetyl cysteine, taurine and quercetine significantly decreased the aforementioned venlafaxine-induced cellular events. Also, radical scavenger (butylatedhydroxytoluene and α-tocopherol), CYP 2 E 1 inhibitor (4 -methylpyrazole), lysosomotropic agents (methylamine and chloroquine), ATP generators (L-gluthamine and fructose) and mitochondrial pore <b>sealing</b> <b>agents</b> (trifluoperazine and L-carnitine) considerably reduced cytotoxicity, ROS generation and lysosomal leakage following venlafaxine treatment.

Conclusion: Therefore, our data indicate that venlafaxine induces oxidative stress towards hepatocytes and our findings provide evidence to propose that mitochondria and lysosomes are of the primary targets in venlafaxine-mediated cell damage...|$|R
40|$|Control of the 3 D {{microenvironment}} for {{cultured cells}} {{is essential for}} understanding the complex relationships that biomolecular concentration gradients have on cellular growth, regeneration, and differentiation. This paper reports a microfluidic device for delivering gradients of soluble molecules to cells in an open reservoir without exposing the cells to flow. The cells are cultured on a polyester membrane that shields them from the flow that delivers the gradient. A novel “lid” design is implemented which prevents leakage from around the membrane without requiring <b>sealing</b> <b>agents</b> or adhesives. Once layers are molded, device fabrication can be performed within minutes while at room temperature. Surface gradients were characterized with epifluorescence microscopy; image analysis verified that sharp gradients (∼ 33 μm wide) can be reproducibly generated. We show that heterogeneous laminar flow patterns of Orange and Green Cell Tracker (CT) applied beneath the membrane can be localized to cells cultured on the other side; concentration profile scans show the extent of CT diffusion parallel to the membrane’s surface to be 10 – 20 μm. Our device is ideal for conventional cell culture because the cell culture surface is readily accessible to physical manipulation (e. g., micropipette access), the cell culture medium is {{in direct contact with}} the incubator atmosphere (i. e., no special protocols for ensuring proper equilibration of gas concentrations are required), and the cells are not subjected to flow-induced shear forces, which are advantageous attributes not commonly found in closed-channel microfluidic designs...|$|R

A special unit headed by Dr. Johannes Pohl, {{chief of the}} Hebraica {{collection}} at the Frankfurt Institute’s library, appeared in Salonica, where he had the Alfred Rosenberg <b>agents</b> <b>seal</b> the yeshiva collections, in which the city abounded. However, {{members of the community}} were able to hide or disguise many of the collections from the Germans. A later visit in September 1942 by a scholar named Maertsch, likewise resulted in no new additions to the Frankfurt library. However, a 1943 report does show that 10,000 volumes had been received from Greece.|$|R
