The <b>metal</b> <b>blank</b> is held in {{position}} on the die using blank holder. Mechanical force is applied {{on the part of the}} <b>metal</b> <b>blank</b> above the die cavity through a punch.

40|$|The work is {{dedicated}} to EMF attraction processes which can deform both ferromagnetic and non-ferromagnetic sheet metal materials (low carbon steels, stainless steels and aluminum alloys) using low frequency discharges. The analytical models of both tooling configurations are based upon the solution of Maxwell equations in axially symmetrical formulation. For ferromagnetic materials, the attraction effect is based upon magnetic forces prevailing over the Lorentz forces for low frequency discharges. For nonferromagnetic materials, the attraction forces are created by employing the auxiliary screen which attracts the sheet <b>metal</b> <b>blank.</b> The concept of attraction in this inductor system is based upon inducing currents flowing in the same directions in the screen and in the sheet <b>metal</b> <b>blank.</b> In addition to the analytical models, the described concepts are illustrated by the experimental results on attraction of sheet <b>metal</b> <b>blanks</b> employing a single turn inductor...|$|R

Conventional mechanical and hydraulic dampers require additional machine power and higher loads, which make critical their use in many applications. This paper presents an innovative system, based on magneto-rheological fluids, for the vibrations damping in sheet metalworking operations. The developed prototypes prove to decrease the vibrations generated in sheet <b>metal</b> <b>blanking</b> with significant reduction of the energy dissipated during the process...|$|R
40|$|The article {{describes}} various methods for solving problems of nonstationary heat transfer. Nonstationary heat transfer {{is characterized by}} the fact that the temperature changes not only from point to point, but also in time. The process of cooling <b>metal</b> <b>blanks</b> must be considered a transient thermal conductivity. When solving the problem of cooling <b>metal</b> <b>blanks</b> we need to find the temperature change in the section. The authors show the complexity of the tasks of nonstationary heat transfer. If we consider the process of cooling metal billets as a complex process, in which the addition of nonstationary heat transfer is presented as a process of heat transfer by radiation, great probability of errors in calculations occurs. There is the feasibility of the use of experimental researches of cooling processes for <b>metal</b> <b>blanks</b> after continuous casting, in order to determine the error in the calculated values...|$|R

Grinding wheels designed for steel {{are not to be}} used for grinding <b>softer</b> <b>metals,</b> like aluminium.

50|$|Measurement of {{the amount}} of drawing {{performed}} on a sheet <b>metal</b> <b>blank</b> is quantified using drawing ratio. The higher the drawing ratio, the more extreme the amount of deep drawing. Due to the geometry, forces, metal flow and material properties of the work, {{there is a limit to}} the amount of deep drawing that can be performed on a sheet <b>metal</b> <b>blank</b> in a single operation. The drawing ratio is roughly calculated as,DR = Db/Dp.Db is the diameter of the blank and Dp is the diameter of the punch. For shapes that are noncircular the maximum diameter is sometimes used, or occasionally drawing ratio is calculated using surface areas. The limit to the drawing ratio for an operation is usually 2 or under.|$|R

5000|$|This {{is found}} principally with <b>soft</b> <b>metals.</b> Two <b>soft</b> ligands in mutual trans {{position}} {{will have a}} destabilizing effect on each other.

The phenomenon may be explained in terms of a trans influence:“With two π-acid ligands in mutual trans positions at a class-b metal, there would be a destabilizing competition for the dπ electrons on the metal. A π-acid bonded to a <b>soft</b> <b>metal</b> thus makes a metal a harder Lewis acid. Similarly a soft σ-donor will tend to polarize the electron density on a <b>soft</b> <b>metal,</b> causing it to favour an electrovalently bonded ligand in the trans position.” ...|$|R

40|$|Design and {{realisation}} of a <b>metal</b> <b>blanking</b> {{process in}} current industrial practice are mainly based on empirical knowledge.

The large, localised deformations are handled by an Operator Split Arbitrary Lagrange Euler (OS-ALE) method supplemented by full remeshing. Transport of the state variables between subsequent meshes for the OS-ALE and remeshing methods is accomplished by the Discontinous Galerkin (DG) method and an interpolation procedure, respectively. Ductile fracture is incorporated using a discrete cracking approach, which is shown to generate mesh independent results...|$|R
