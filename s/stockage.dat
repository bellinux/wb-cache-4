40|$|International audienceThe use of CSEM onshore {{monitoring}} for CO 2 plume migration characterization {{completes the}} information brought by seismic methods (localisation of saturation fronts) : it {{is sensitive to}} the positive resistivity variations in the aquifer induced by supercritical C 02 injection. Once a baseline 3 D seismic survey is done and the structural seismic horizons are known, CSEM monitoring could compete with seismic monitoring because of its really low cost and its ease of implementation. CSEM monitoring also brings complementary information to the electrical methods of monitoring: the depth of investigation is significantly higher than electrical methods, and CSEM permit a to inject multi-frequency currents in the ground (which allows a multi-scale scanning of the subsurface). Electrical methods have a very narrow resolution in the superficial subsurface while CSEM map greater depths and larger volumes. Moreover, CSEM surveys are also easy repeatable due to developments in current injections devices {{and the use of}} differential GPS monitoring of surface electrodes positions. Accuracy of CSEM double LEMAM (“Longue-Electrode-Mise-à-la Masse”, using boreholes metallic casings as long electrodes) and double MAM method (“Mise-à la Masse”, using downhole electrodes) for CO 2 injection monitoring has been tested several times. While the repeatability noise is of a 1 % order (shown by Bourgeois et al., 2012 a), the electromagnetic response of a CO 2 plume in a 1 -km deep saline aquifer can reach several percents respect to the original baseline fields (ie pre-injection measurements), depending on the source and reservoir setup. Both double LEMAM and surface-to-LEMAM (or single-LEMAM) setups are particularly suited for deep CO 2 injection monitoring because they are based on current injection directly in the deep aquifer layers using the borehole metallic casings as electrodes. The BRGM knowledge in this domain has been constructed on several consecutive and coherent projects (EMSAPCO 2, CO 2 ReMoVe, CO 2 CARE and EM HONTOMIN) integrating field operations, data processing, uncertainties analysis and modeling (Bourgeois et al., 2012 b). Double MAM CSEM monitoring proved its ability to map the CO 2 plume and to characterize its migration during the Ketzin experiment (Girard et al., 2011). CSEM fields (electric and magnetic fields) measurements showed variations above the repeatability noise and spatially associated with the CO 2 plume migration at short/medium term migration process (the CSEM method was at least able to detect a 17200 t CO 2 bubble propagating at 700 m depth). At Hontomín, a CSEM baseline dataset has been acquired in December 2013 using a new type of CSEM source, involving surface electrodes and one borehole casing, the so-called surface LEMAM setup, which is supposed to be more sensitive to a CO 2 plume than the classical double LEMAM setup (results to be published). The Hontomín experiment is challenging for the CSEM approach because a lower volume of CO 2 than Ketzin will be injected at a depth twice the injection depth at Ketzin. Our strategy to overcome these conditions was to use a dense network of CSEM receiver station, with multi frequency acquisition, two different geometries of source polarization and current injection directly in the reservoir by the surface-LEMAM method. First results will be presented. In addition, in order to assess the feasibility of CSEM imaging for reservoir characterization, we will also present one application in the frame of geothermal exploration: a CSEM survey was performed at the Le Lamentin area (Martinique, French Indies) using 400 m long energized metallic casings of two deep exploration boreholes as long electrodes for current injection (the so-called double Longue Electrode Mise-à-la-Masse setup, hereafter 2 xLEMAM). Imaging results (frequency dependent apparent resistivity maps and profiles) reveal a very conductive area north of the Fort de France Bay connected to a known poly-phased geothermal system and shallow salt water intrusion. The most conductive body is proposed to be the geo-electrical signature of an active hydrothermal system, superimposed on the signature of a conductive fossilized geothermal system. It is spatially well correlated with high temperature borehole logs. Meanwhile, low temperature areas associated with the fossil hydro-thermal system plugged by clay minerals display less conductive values. Bourgeois, B., Coppo, N., Girard,. J. F. (2012).

40|$|The present {{work was}} based on the {{investigation}} of different thin film components of Li ionbatteries. A first part was dedicated to the deposition of cathodes in thin film form of aknown material, LiCoO 2, and an alternative one, Li(NiMnCo) O 2 employing physical vapordeposition (PVD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD), respectively. Results on thedeposition of LiCoO 2 showed how after cycling there is a reduction of rate capability andincrease in interface resistance. The X-ray diffraction pattern showed the presence of severalorientations related to the known HT phases found in literature for LiCoO 2 with lowcrystallinity. On the other hand Li(NixMnyCoz) O 2 thin films prepared via aerosol assistedCVD were analyzed with X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinement using the March-Dollasemodel for the determination of the texturing and microstructural characteristics. Additionallythe morphology of the films was characterized using scanning electron microscopy. Theinvestigation showed that concentration of precursor solution and process pressures have asignificant effect on the film morphology and texturing. A second part was focused on the cathode-electrolyte interface for three case studies: 1) asdeposited LiCoO 2 cathode thin film, 2) ZrO 2 coated LiCoO 2 thin film and 3) LiPON coatedLiCoO 2 thin film. The interface cathode-electrolyte of these three cases were studied beforeand after galvanostatic cycling to determine surface layer characteristics and changes arisingon the interface after battery operation. The interface of a bare LiCoO 2 layer was furtherstudied after soaking in liquid electrolyte to elucidate the effect of short storage procedures inbatteries. Surface analysis done on LiCoO 2 thin films showed changes occurring at the interface layersafter the electrode was in short contact with the electrolyte solution and after galvanostaticcycling. Washing and soaking the electrode material in electrolyte and solvent showed thatsurface reactions start from the first contact. A main component of the electrolyte solution,LiPF 6, has critical effect since it can decompose and form HF which reacts with carbonatesand forms LiF on the surface. Given the large amount of LiF, a high reactivity of LiCoO 2 withthe decomposed species was observed, as the main components of the film were related to thedecomposed LiPF 6 salt. The surface chemistry of the layer formed on LiCoO 2 after cycling was mainly based ondecomposed species from the electrolyte salt arising from carbonated and fluorinated species. Artificial surface layers were deposited on LiCoO 2 by means of rf sputtering. The thin layersof ZrO 2 and LiPON used as coatings had minor effects on the original film morphology andcrystalline structure. An XPS analysis of the interface showed how the nature of each layerafter galvanostatic cycling was different for each case. The resulting artificial surface layerformed from ZrO 2 coating showed mainly inorganic species, while the LiPON coatedcathode showed an organic nature. The final surface layers after electrochemical cycling ofthe ZrO 2 coated film resembled that of the uncoated LiCoO 2. Additionally, LiPON thin films were studied on the basis of structural changes occurringwith nitrogenation and its correlation to a possible mechanism during ion conduction. Composition of phosphate glasses with rf sputtering was proven to be greatly influenced bythe gas ratio employed. The largest variations were observed for lower amounts of N 2 in thegas mixture. The IR spectra results showed important differences in the short range order forfilms with a similar amount of lithium. The lithium phosphorus oxynitride films depositedhere presented glassy structures with mainly ortho and pyro-phosphate units with smallamounts of short metaphosphate chains. Nitrogen insertion favors stability of lithium bygiving an environment with lower potential energy, as was evidenced by the far-IR results. Ce travail porte sur la recherche de différentes compositions de couches minces pouraccumulateurs Li-ion. Une première partie a été dédiée au dépôts de cathode sous forme de couche mince d’unmatériau connu, LiCoO 2, et d’un matériau alternatif, Li(NiMnCo) O 2 en utilisant le dépôtphysique en phase vapeur (PVD) et le dépôt chimique en phase vapeur (CVD),respectivement. Les résultats (LiCoO 2) ont montrés comment, après cyclage, il y a diminutionde la capacité à cycler à régime rapide et augmentation de la résistance à l’interface. Ladiffraction des rayons X a montré la présence de différentes orientations, peu cristallisées,appartenant à la phase LiCoO 2 HT selon confirmation par la littérature. Les couches mincesde Li(NixMnyCo 1 -x-y) O 2 ont été préparées par dépôt chimique en phase vapeur assisté paraérosol. La diffraction des rayons X et l’analyse Rietveld utilisant le modèle March-Dollase aété mise en oeuvre pour la détermination de la texture et des caractéristiques microstructurales. La morphologie des films a été caractérisée par microscopie électronique à balayage. L’étudea montré que la concentration de la solution de précurseur et la pression totale ont un effetmajeur sur la morphologie des films et leur texture. Une seconde partie s’est focalisée sur l’interface cathode-électrolyte pour trois cas d’étude : 1) couche mince de matériau de cathode LiCoO 2, 2) couche mince de LiCoO 2 recouvert de ZrO 2 et 3) couche mince de LiCoO 2 recouvert de LIPON.

Approximately 3. 6 m. mol of methane per gram of water was consumed as MH in the hollow silica matrix and the formation kinetics was extremely fast (180 min).

We describe {{the costs and benefits}} of consolidating these inventories within the Forward Support Battalion's (FSB) Assigned <b>Stockage</b> List (ASL). We show that consolidating at the FSB reduces the overall variance in demand for many of the inventory lines and allows the brigade to stock lower quantities of these lines, while maintaining essentially the same service levels.

40|$|Stable carbon isotopic {{fractionation}} during {{calcium carbonate}} precipitation induced by urease-catalysed hydrolysis of urea was experimentally investigated in artificial water {{at a constant}} temperature of 30 degrees C. Carbon isotope fractionation during urea hydrolysis follows a Rayleigh distillation trend characterized by a C- 13 -enrichment factor of - 20 to - 22 parts per thousand. CaCO 3 precipitate is up to 17. 9 parts per thousand C- 13 -depleted relative to the urea substrate (- 48. 9 +/- 0. 07 parts per thousand). Initial CaCO 3 precipitate forms close to isotopic equilibrium with dissolved inorganic carbon. Subsequent precipitation occurs at - 2 to - 3 parts per thousand offset from isotopic equilibrium, suggesting that the initial delta C- 13 value of CaCO 3 is reset through dissolution followed by reprecipitation with urease molecules {{playing a role in}} offsetting the delta C- 13 value of CaCO 3 from isotopic equilibrium. Potentially, this isotopic systematics may provide a tool for the diagnosis of ureolytically-formed carbonate cements used as sealing agent. Moreover, it may serve as a basis to develop a carbon isotope tool for the quantification of ureolytically-induced CO 2 sequestration. Finally, it suggests carbon isotope disequilibrium as a hallmark of past enzymatic activity in ancient microbial carbonate formation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of Green-House Gas Emissions (GHGE) {{goes through a}} sum of solutions {{that need to be}} tuned to the local context in terms of energy needs and resources, and also to the demand and offer variations with time. The housing heat consumption is particularly concerned as it is seasonal and rarely in phase with the deliverability of alternative or renewable energy sources. This paper studies heat storage in saline untapped aquifers as a solution to overcome the time lag between production and consumption. This process applies to heat networks that supply dense housing complexes. Firstly, a methodology is described to size an Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES) project {{as a function of the}} heat production and consumption characteristics on the one hand, and of the recovery factor of the stored heat on the other hand. The major role played by this recovery factor leads to a review of thermal losses of various origins and to a sensitivity study of influent reservoir parameters such as the aquifer thickness, productivity and heterogeneity, for the purpose of aquifer selection and storage project management. La reduction des Gaz a Effet de Serre (GES) passe par un ensemble de solutions qui doivent etre adaptees au contexte local des besoins et ressources en energie, ainsi qu’aux variations de l’offre et la demande au cours du temps. Ce constat concerne en particulier la consommation d’energie calorifique destinee a l’habitat. En effet, cette consommation de chaleur est saisonniere et rarement en phase avec la disponibilite des sources d’energie alternatives ou renouvelables. Cet article etudie le <b>stockage</b> de chaleur dans des aquiferes salins inexploites en tant que solution pour pallier ce dephasage entre production et consommation. Ce procede concerne les reseaux de chaleur desservant un habitat concentre. En premier lieu, une methodologie quantitative est decrite pour dimensionner le projet de <b>stockage</b> d’energie thermique en aquifere en fonction des caracteristiques de production et de consommation d’une part, et du coefficient de recuperation de la chaleur stockee d’autre part. Le role important joue par ce facteur de recuperation nous amene a une revue des pertes thermiques de diverses origines et a une etude de sensibilite a divers parametres de reservoir, tels que son epaisseur, sa productivite et son heterogeneite, dans l’optique de la selection de l’aquifere et de la conduite du projet de <b>stockage...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The Southern Adriatic Sea {{is one of}} {{the five}} {{prospective}} areas for CO 2 storage being evaluated under the three year (FP 7) European SiteChar project dedicated to the characterization of European CO 2 storage sites. The potential reservoir for CO 2 storage is represented by a carbonate formation, the wackstones and packstones of the Scaglia Formation (Upper Cretaceous-Paleogene). In this paper, we present the geological characterization and the 3 D modeling that led to the identification of three sites, named Grazia, Rovesti and Grifone, where the Scaglia Formation, with an average thickness of 50 m, reveals good petrophysical characteristics and is overlain by an up to 1 200 thick caprock. The vicinity of the selected sites to the Enel- Federico II power plant (one of the major Italian CO 2 emittor) where a pilot plant for CO 2 capture has been already started in April 2010, represents a good opportunity to launch the first Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) pilot project in Italy and to apply this technology at industrial level, strongly contributing at the same time at reducing the national CO 2 emissions.

In France, several agencies and companies {{are involved in the}} development and implementation of LLW technology. The Commissariat a l`Energie Atomic (CEA), is responsible for research and development of new technologies. The Agence National pour la Gestion des Dechets Radioactifs is the agency responsible for the construction and operation of disposal facilities and for wastes acceptance for these facilities. Compagnie Generale des Matieres Nucleaires provides fuel services, including uranium enrichment, fuel fabrication, and fuel reprocessing, and is thus one generator of LLW. Societe pour les Techniques Nouvelles is an engineering company responsible for commercializing CEA waste management technology and for engineering and design support for the facilities. Numatec, Inc. is a US company representing these French companies and agencies in the US. In Task 1. 1 of Numatec`s contract with Martin Marietta Energy Systems, Numatec provides details on the design, construction and operation of the LLW disposal facilities at CSM and CSA. Lessons learned from operation of CSM and incorporated into the design, construction and operating procedures at CSA are identified and discussed. The process used by the French for identification, selection, and evaluation of disposal technologies is provided. Specifically, the decisionmaking process resulting in the change in disposal facility design for the CSA versus the CSM is discussed.
