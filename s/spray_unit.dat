40|$|Application of SCR {{catalyst}} {{technology in}} a light-duty Diesel exhaust system requires injection of a reductant. Aqueous urea is injected with a <b>spray</b> <b>unit</b> {{directly into the}} exhaust upstream of an SCR catalyst. Ideally, the aqueous urea droplets must first evaporate and break down to ammonia and HCNO before reaching the catalyst. Multiple chemical reactions then occur on the catalyst reducing NOx. Droplet size is thus critical in this process. Laser PDPA measurements {{have been made in}} the laboratory of the diameter of water droplets from a commercially available urea <b>spray</b> <b>unit</b> in hot air flow to characterize the spray. These measurements have shown significant numbers of droplets with diameters greater than 120 microns. Measurements have also been made with a typical mixer unit downstream of the <b>spray</b> <b>unit</b> and the effect of this on the droplet size distribution is reported. A simple model of the warm up and evaporation of an aqueous urea droplet convecting in a Diesel exhaust has been developed. This can be run as a single droplet simulation programme but could be incorporated into a full CFD model. The latter is required for designing SCR injection systems without recourse to testing. The model is valid for the early part of the evaporation process where it is assumed that water leaves the aqueous urea droplet and also for the later stage where the urea leaves the droplet prior to breaking down by thermolysis. The model has been tested against data available in the literature. The effect of initial droplet size, droplet injection temperature and velocity, and of the exhaust temperature, vapour pressure and flow rate under typical operating conditions are demonstrated. The implications of the model are that the urea droplets must be very small, less than 50 microns, if they are to evaporate in the short distance between the injector and the catalyst in a typical light duty Diesel exhaust system...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Pest {{and disease}} control in {{vineyards}} and orchards {{is a key}} feature for obtaining healthy and economically efficient crops, spraying equipments being widely used for plant protection. The technical performance of the spraying equipment has a significant effect over the efficiency indices of the plant protection methods: specific consumption of chemical solution, working capacity of the <b>spraying</b> <b>units,</b> fuel consumption, homogeneity of distribution over the entire foliage system etc. In this paper a new design of the vineyard spraying equipment was investigated, aiming for the partial recovery of the chemical solution, which otherwise would be lost; thus the consumption of chemical substance was decreased. The sprayer was equipped with recovery panels, mounted sideways, in order to retain the liquid droplets which would otherwise pass through the foliar system. he above-mentioned system can be mounted on different types of universal vineyard spraying machines.

Highly skilled labors {{and a number of}} adjustable knobs are required to produce the high quality coating works using the conventional au-tomatic spray gun which is cost intensive. Therefore, linear motor operated multiple spray operations spray gun has been developed. This spray gun consists of two spray units, an air control and supply unit and a triggering unit to carry out the multiple spray operations. This paper focuses on the design optimization and fabrication of the housing of the spray units which hold fluid nozzles, air nozzles, an assembly cap, a needle valve or a ball valve. In the air less and air assisted airless spray systems, high pressurized liquid is passed through the nozzle which is held by the housing of the <b>spray</b> <b>unit.</b> Before entering into the nozzle, the high pressurized liquid is passed through the housing. For the simplicity of the analysis, it is assumed that the housing is an open-ended pressure vessel.

40|$|A novel mobile fine <b>spray</b> <b>unit,</b> utilising a Spill-Return Atomiser® (SRA) {{has been}} {{designed}} and developed {{for the purpose of}} decontamination within healthcare environments. The unit is able to spray uniformly onto any given surface, providing 'mist like' coverage. The high liquid pressure fine spray swirl atomiser that has been developed incorporates a spill-return orifice into the rear face of the swirl chamber with the aim of giving a significant reduction in flow rate whilst maintaining droplet size. Initial work modified a commercial atomiser to add spill-return. However drop sizes were considered to be too large and a new design was constructed based upon earlier work on efficient high pressure (up to 12 MPa) swirl atomisation. The atomiser was characterised for different geometries, supply pressures and spill return orifice sizes using a Laser Particle Sizer (Malvern Mastersizer-X) and Phase Doppler Anemometry (PDA). Spill-Return Swirl Atomiser (SRA) with a long swirl chamber was also designed and experimentally tested. This was found to have a direct reflection on the control of spray characteristics and the determination of the coating performance of the SRA on various surfaces in achieving the desired efficiency in the disinfection procedure. The subsequent coating and coverage produced by the SRA was analysed both quantatively and qualitatively via a range of test procedures. The investigation has found that the utilisation of fine sprays (15 um<D 32 < 25 um) at high liquid pressure (< 12 MPa) and low flow rates (< 0. 3 1 /min) is indeed suitable for surface disinfection in healthcare applications (i. e. MRSA, VRSA etc.). Moreover, the resulting fine sprays can be used for various applications such as humidification, cleaning, coating, cooling and decontamination.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} impact of {{instructional}} guidance in the regular use of use nicotine nasal spray (NNS) on the true use of NNS during the first three weeks of smoking cessation for heavy smokers who are willing to quit. METHODS: This randomized, open, controlled trial included 50 patients who were heavy smokers, were willing to quit, and attending an academic outpatient clinic in Western Switzerland. Patients were randomised to instruction on NNS use as "ad libitum" (administration whenever cravings appear; control group) or to use NNS when craving appears and at least every hour when awake (intervention group). Intakes were monitored using an electronic device fixed in the <b>spray</b> <b>unit</b> (MDILog) during the first three weeks of use. Self reported abstinence from smoking at six months was confirmed by expired-air carbon monoxide. Using intention-to-treat analysis, random-effect GLS regression was used to calculate the mean difference of daily doses between groups controlling for lack of independence between measures from the same individual. RESULTS: One patient was lost to follow-up. At baseline randomization, the group receiving instruction to use NNS hourly included more women, patients with previous desires to quit, and patients with more psychiatric comorbidities and less somatic complaints compared to the group instructed to use NNS with cravings (group imbalance). Both groups self-administered more than the daily recommended dosage of 8 uses. Mean daily usage was 13. 6 dose/day and 11. 1 dose/day for the group instructed to use NNS hourly and with cravings, respectively. Adjusting for baseline imbalance, the increased daily doses in the intervention group (hourly use) remained nonsignificant compared to ad libitum use (- 0. 5 dose/day; CI 95 % - 6. 2; 5. 3, from day 1 to day 7; and 2. 3 dose/day; CI 95 % - 5. 4; 10. 0, from day 8 to day 21). Instructing patients to use the NNS daily had no effect on smoking cessation at six months (RR = 0. 69; CI 95 % 0. 34; 1. 39). CONCLUSION: Heavy smokers willing to quit use NNS frequently, regardless of the instructions given. Recommending the use of NNS only when craving appears for heavy smokers willing to quit seems acceptable compared to prescribing hourly administration.

This property, along with their good water solubility, enables them to be applied to tree crops by trunk injection, aerial application or backpack <b>spray</b> <b>units</b> for the control of Phytophthora root rots.

Recent work completed at Murdoch University in conjuction with Alcoa of Australia Ltd and CALM has indicated that some plants (i) vary in their response to phosphite as the concentration increases, (ii) are affected by and recover from phytotoxicity in different ways and time periods, (iii) distribute phosphite differently within the plant, and (iv) sometimes reduce flowering and seed set.

40|$|THESIS ABSTRACT Current control {{strategies}} for livestock ectoparasites {{are limited by}} problems associated with chemical resistance and residues. Fungal biopesticides could provide an alternative control without these problems. However, a strategic approach is needed to first evaluate the suitability of selected fungal isolates for fungal biopesticide development. Two ectoparasites of significance to cattle and sheep are the cattle tick Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (Canestrini) and the Australian sheep blowfly Lucilia cuprina (Wiedmann). The fungus Metarhizium anisopliae (Metsch.) Sorokin) was evaluated for its potential to control these livestock ectoparasites. The growth characteristics of 30 isolates of M. anisopliae were investigated. Radial growth measurements were used to identify vigorous isolates that grew well at 30 C and were capable of growing at 35 C. A qualitative assessment of sporulation capacity further refined the candidate isolate group. A possible nutritive role {{of oil in the}} formulation was also investigated. However, there was no clear support for the theory that oil as a formulation additive could boost the germination and growth of the fungal conidia in vitro. Quantal response bioassays were conducted with cattle ticks and sheep blowflies using a range of conidial doses of three different isolates of M. anisopliae and different methods of inoculation. Ticks were either dosed with 2 µl or immersed in the conidial doses. Blowflies were either dosed with 2 µl of the conidial doses or fed conidia mixed with sugar. Probit analyses were carried out on the mortality data to compare the virulence of these isolates to ticks and blowflies and look for indications of different virulence mechanisms employed by M. anisopliae isolates when invading these hosts. One isolate (ARIM 16) showed high virulence to both hosts killing 95 % of ticks after two days and 88 (± 2) % of blowflies after four days. Strikingly different mortality patterns indicated quite different virulence mechanisms operating when M. anisopliae invades ticks or blowflies. The mortality pattern seen with ticks suggested that the number of conidia adhering per unit area of the cuticle was more important for rapid tick death than the total number of conidia contacting the entire tick surface. Blowflies fed conidia mixed with food died rapidly after an initial lag phase regardless of dose. Microscopic investigations were carried out to resolve the basis of the virulence patterns observed. The spatial and temporal aspects of the invasion of ticks and blowflies by M. anisopliae isolate ARIM 16 were investigated with different types of microscopy. The scanning electron microscope and stereo light microscope were used to record surface changes and events and the compound light microscope revealed internal changes. Two distinctly different patterns of invasion were found in ticks and blowflies. Fungal conidia germinated on the surface of ticks then hyphae simultaneously penetrated into the tick body and grew across the tick surface. There was extensive fungal degradation of the tick cuticle with a preference for the outer endocuticle. While large numbers of conidia adhered to the surface of blowflies, no conidia were recorded germinating on external surfaces. One germinating conidium was seen in the entrance to the buccal cavity. Investigations of the fly interior revealed a higher density of hyphal bodies in the haemolymph surrounding the buccal cavity than in haemolymph from regions of the upper thorax. This pattern suggested that fungal invasion of the blowfly is through the buccal cavity. Plentiful extracellular mucilage was seen around the hyphae on ticks, and crystals of calcium oxalate were seen amongst the hyphae on the surface of ticks and in the haemolymph of blowflies killed by M. anisopliae isolate ARIM 16. It was considered that cattle ticks are more suited for control with fungal biopesticides than adult blowflies. Three field trials were conducted over twelve months to assess the pathogenicity of M. anisopliae to parasitic stages of R. microplus on dairy heifers under different environmental conditions. Two isolates were selected based on their high optimal growth temperature (30 oC), good conidial production characteristics and ability to kill adult engorged ticks in the laboratory in minimum time. Conidia were formulated in an oil emulsion and applied using a motor driven <b>spray</b> <b>unit.</b> Surface temperatures of selected animals were monitored, as were the ambient temperature and relative humidity.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to create a calibration model based on near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy data obtained during a small-scale coating process to predict in-line the coating layer thickness of tablets coated in a side-vented drum coater. The developed setup for the small-scale coating process consisted of a rotating plate with 20 tablets molds that pass a <b>spraying</b> <b>unit,</b> a heating unit, and an in-line NIR spectroscopy probe during one rotation. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) was compressed to flat-faced tablets, and these were coated with a sustained release coating suspension containing Kollicoat IR and Kollicoat SR 30 D. The film thickness of these tablets was determined for each tablet individually with a digital micrometer. A calibration model of predicted film thickness versus real-film thickness using PLS regression was developed. This model was tested against in-line NIR data obtained from a coating drum process, in which biconvex HDPE tablets were film-coated with the same film-coating suspension. The model predicted a final coating thickness of 240 μm, while the measured average thickness (n = 100 tablets) was 210 μm. Taking into account the use of a different setup and differently shaped tablets, it was possible to predict the coating thickness with accuracy comparable to the one of the digital micrometer. Thus, the small-scale rotating plate system was found to be an efficient means of preparing calibration model for a tablet-coating drum process...|$|R

40|$|In this study, the {{temperature}} {{distribution of the}} surfaces of several substrates under an impinging gas jet from a cold spray nozzle was determined. A low-pressure cold-gas dynamic <b>spraying</b> <b>unit</b> was used to generate a jet of hot compressed nitrogen that impinged upon 02 at substrates. Computer codes based on a 01 nite differences method were used to solve a simpli 01 ed 2 D temperature distribution equation for the substrate to produce nondimensional relationships between the surface temperature and the radius of the impinging 02 uid jet, the axial velocity of the cold spray nozzle, the substrate thickness, and the heating time. It was found that a single pro 01 le of the transient nondimensional maximum surface temperature {{could be used to}} estimate the dimensional maximum surface temperature, regardless {{of the value of the}} compressed gas temperature. It was found further that, as the thermal conductance of the substrate increased, the maximum surface temperature of the substrate beneath the gas jet decreased. Heat exchange between the substrate and the compressed gas jet during motion of the nozzle to produce heat conduction within the substrate was characterized by the nondimensional Pecle 4 t number. It was found that lower Pecle 4 t numbers produced higher temperatures within the substrate. The close agreement of the numerical results with the experimental results suggests that the nondimensionalized results may be applied to a wide range of conditions and materials.

40|$|We {{report on}} a {{flexible}} ultraviolet (UV) photodetector fabricated using an all-spray-coating process. Two <b>spray</b> coating <b>units</b> were utilized to deposit semiconducting tin oxide nanowires as an active channel layer and metallic silver nanowires as an electrode layer. The device was mounted {{on the back of}} a human hand, and the UV intensities in sunlight were monitored over time. The fabricated flexible UV photodetector showed highly sensitive, stable, and reproducible detection properties. The main advantage of the proposed fabrication method is the extension of the integration environment by allowing direct application on various substrates, such as clothes and human skin, with varying device size and shape...|$|R
