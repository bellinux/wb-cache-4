50|$|Surgical uses of 3D printing-centric therapies have {{a history}} {{beginning}} in the mid-1990s with anatomical modeling for bony reconstructive surgery planning. By practicing on a tactile model before surgery, surgeons were more prepared and patients received better care. Patient-matched implants were {{a natural extension of}} this work, leading to truly personalized implants that fit one unique individual. Virtual planning of surgery and guidance using 3D printed, personalized instruments have been applied to many areas of surgery including total joint replacement and craniomaxillofacial reconstruction with great success. Further study of the use of models for planning heart and solid organ surgery has led to increased use in these areas. Hospital-based 3D printing is now of great interest and many institutions are pursuing adding this specialty within individual radiology departments. The technology is being used to create unique, patient-matched devices for rare illnesses. One example of this is the bioresorbable trachial splint to treat newborns with tracheobronchomalacia developed at the University of Michigan. Several devices manufacturers have also begin using 3D printing for patient-matched <b>surgical</b> <b>guides</b> (polymers). The use of additive manufacturing for serialized production of orthopedic implants (metals) is also increasing due to the ability to efficiently create porous surface structures that facilitate osseointegration. Printed casts for broken bones can be custom-fitted and open, letting the wearer scratch any itches, wash and ventilate the damaged area. They can also be recycled.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE This {{systematic}} review verified the usefulness/limitations of static <b>surgical</b> <b>guides</b> during implant {{surgery in the}} edentulous maxilla. The PICO question was: "Does the use of digitally generated <b>surgical</b> <b>guides</b> vs conventional techniques affect the following outcomes: surgical complications, implant complications, prosthesis complications, implant survival, prosthesis survival, economics, patient satisfaction, and maintenance intervention?" MATERIALS AND METHODS The electronic searches retrieved 2, 588 unique articles from which eventually 36 full-text articles were read for eligibility. Because no randomized controlled clinical trials could be found, the PICO question had to be reformulated, now only looking to the outcome of digitally generated <b>surgical</b> <b>guides</b> without comparison with conventional techniques. RESULTS Although long-term data are lacking, the outcome of implants placed with a static guide and of the prosthetic reconstruction seems similar to that expected from conventional techniques. The number of surgical complications with guided surgery is negligible. Guided flapless implant surgery offers slightly more comfort for the patient; however, the economic benefits are unclear.

30|$|Currently, {{preoperative}} surgical simulations {{are widely}} used and confer an array of advantages [13].

40|$|Background: A {{reduction}} in orthodontic treatment {{time can be}} attained using corticotomies. The aggressive nature of corticotomy due to the elevation of muco-periosteal flaps and to {{the duration of the}} surgery raised reluctance for its employ among patients and dental community. This study aims to provide detailed information on the design and manufacture of a 3 D-printed CAD-CAM (computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing) <b>surgical</b> <b>guide</b> which can aid the clinician in achieving a minimally-invasive, flapless corticotomy. Material and Methods: An impression of dental arches was created; the models were digitally-acquired using a 3 D scanner and saved as STereoLithography (STL) files. The patient underwent cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) : images of jaws and teeth were transformed into 3 D models and saved as an STL file. An acrylic template with the design of a <b>surgical</b> <b>guide</b> was manufactured and scanned. The STLs of jaws, scanned casts, and acrylic templates were matched. 3 D modeling software allowed the view of the 3 D models from different perspectives and planes with perfect rendering.

40|$|Implant {{treatment}} increasingly {{focuses on}} the reduction of treatment time and postoperative impairment. The improvement of 3 D dental diagnosis by ConeBeam computed tomography allows detailed preparation for the surgical placement of dental implants under prosthetic considerations.

40|$|Abstract Background Malunion is {{the most}} common {{complication}} of distal radius fracture. It has previously been demonstrated that there is a correlation between the quality of anatomical correction and overall wrist function. However, surgical correction can be difficult because of the often complex anatomy associated with this condition. Computer assisted surgical planning, combined with patient-specific <b>surgical</b> <b>guides,</b> has the potential to improve pre-operative understanding of patient anatomy as well as intra-operative accuracy. For patients with malunion of the distal radius fracture, this technology could significantly improve clinical outcomes that largely depend on the quality of restoration of normal anatomy. Therefore, the objective {{of this study is to}} compare patient outcomes after corrective osteotomy for distal radius malunion with and without preoperative computer-assisted planning and peri-operative patient-specific <b>surgical</b> <b>guides.</b> Methods/Design This study is a multi-center randomized controlled trial of conventional planning versus computer-assisted planning for surgical correction of distal radius malunion. Adult patients with extra-articular malunion of the distal radius will be invited to enroll in our study. After providing informed consent, subjects will be randomized to two groups: one group will receive corrective surgery with conventional preoperative planning, while the other will receive corrective surgery with computer-assisted pre-operative planning and peri-operative patient specific <b>surgical</b> <b>guides.</b> In the computer-assisted planning group, a CT scan of the affected forearm as well as the normal, contralateral forearm will be obtained. The images will be used to construct a 3 D anatomical model of the defect and patient-specific <b>surgical</b> <b>guides</b> will be manufactured. Outcome will be measured by DASH and PRWE scores, grip strength, radiographic measurements, and patient satisfaction at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Discussion Computer-assisted surgical planning, combined with patient-specific <b>surgical</b> <b>guides,</b> is a powerful new technology that has the potential to improve the accuracy and consistency of orthopaedic surgery. To date, the role of this technology in upper extremity surgery has not been adequately investigated, and it is unclear whether its use provides any significant clinical benefit over traditional preoperative imaging protocols. Our study will represent the first randomized controlled trial investigating the use of computer assisted surgery in corrective osteotomy for distal radius malunions.
