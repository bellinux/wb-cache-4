40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a research programme on the estimation of moisture content in timber using ultrasonics, by developing working relationships between ultrasonic wave velocity, temperature and percentage moisture content in timber samples during kiln drying. A detailed experimental programme was undertaken to develop relationships between ultrasonic wave propagation velocity and temperature, and between velocity and percentage moisture content for a large number of timber samples. The experimental programme was primarily restricted to samples of jarrah timber, but the procedures can be applied to other species. The results show conclusively that both temperature and moisture content {{have a significant effect on}} the ultrasonic wave propagation velocity in timber, whereas material density does not. Thus, ultrasonics can be used to monitor variations in percentage moisture content during the drying process in a kiln environment. A simple field-testing procedure has been developed for monitoring moisture content in timber using ultrasonics either manually (with a hand calculator) or incorporated into a computer program for on-line monitoring. The procedure is based on simple quadratic equations derived from a statistical regression analysis of velocity and temperature relationships, and velocity and percentage moisture-content relationships.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine how board tenure affects the {{compensation}} of CEOs using a sample of 93 publicly traded US banks. Design/methodology/approach – The paper proposes a CEO allegiance hypothesis whereby long-term relationships with executives and other directors will shift allegiance from shareholders to executives vs a more traditional expertise hypothesis that predicts superior monitoring of executives by directors with longer tenure. A generalized least squares regression methodology is used to examine the relationship between CEO compensation and outside director tenure. Findings – For the full <b>sample,</b> <b>board</b> tenure variables were found to be insignificant. However, when examining a subsample of firms with CEO tenure of greater than six years or more, the relationship between CEO pay and the median tenure of outside directors becomes positive, supporting a CEO allegiance hypothesis. Research limitations/implications – On a caveat, since this study relies on data for large bank holding companies over a short period of time, further research is needed to determine if the results carry over to a broader sample of firms and across time. Practical implications – The results suggest that the independence of outside directors may be compromised when they serve for longer tenure periods together with the same CEO; an important consideration for better corporate governance. Originality/value – The study provides a unique examination of outside director independence from the perspective of board tenure and the long-term relationships with executives and other directors that may result in allegiance shifts away from shareholders and towards managers.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} emerged linking {{physical}} activity with improved academic performance, classroom behavior and school attendance among children and youth. 1 Yet, some communities lack safe and accessible places {{for children to}} play and some schools lack adequate facilities and resources for physical activity and physical education programs. 2 A strategy to expand physical activity opportunities, programs and services for students, staff and the community involves the district or county office of education (COE) jointly sharing recreational facilities with another governmental agency, community-based organization or the community before, during and/or after the school day. This strategy involves sharing program costs, liability, maintenance and operations. This approach {{is commonly known as}} “joint use ” because the school and other entity jointly use one or more facilities, such as gymnasiums, pools, playgrounds, school yards, playing fields, tracks and/or multi-purpose rooms. Policies and practices that provide opportunities for physical activity, such as safe and available open space, indoor/outdoor facilities and physical activity programs and equipment, can help promote healthy behaviors, improve academic outcomes and prevent childhood obesity. In a time of shrinking budgets for school districts/ COEs and local governments, joint use projects provide an opportunity to work together to identify creative solutions to achieve shared goals and priorities (see CSBA’s <b>sample</b> <b>board</b> policy BP 1330. 1 – Joint Use Agreements). Common examples of joint use include: 1) The district/COE opens existing school recreational facilities for public use during non-school hours.

40|$|About {{half the}} total volume of sawlogs end up as sawn timber. The rest is lostdue to drying {{shrinkage}} or is turned into byproducts like wood chips, sawdustand shavings. As the raw material is a large expense for a sawmill, {{it is important to}} fully utilize the logs. The inherent properties of timber are such that warp, such as bow, cup, spring and twist, is inevitable, and extensive knowledge of whether and to what extent warp will appear is therefore important for managing the production. It is also important to develop strategies to handle warped timber, for example in the planing process. This thesis focuses on how twisted timber is affected by the planing process with regard to twist reduction, cross-sectional shape, planer misses and cutting depth. This was studied in three practical tests on sawn timber with differentapproaches. In one test, sawn pine timber with a large variation of twist withinthe group was planed with standard settings, and five evenly spaced crosssections {{along the length of the}} sawn timber were subjected to more detailed studies. In the second test, the main yield from spruce logs was planed. One <b>sample</b> <b>board</b> from each log was planed with the normal pressure settings of the planing mill, while the second sample was planed with a pressure either higher or lower than the normal settings. In this study, seven cross-sections were studied in more detail, three close to the top end, three close to the butt end, and one in the middle of the sawn timber. In the third test, sawn pine timber with a more moderate twist was planed with standard settings in another similar planer.

40|$|The Tasmanian {{sawmilling}} industry typically {{does not}} season eucalypt material specifically for furniture applications {{because of its}} highly refractory seasoning characteristics. Boards cut with wide faces parallel to the growth rings ('backsawn or 'flatsawn' boards), in particular, shrink significantly with drying and often experience surface checking (seasoning 'degrade'). It is standard practice to season timber batches under schedules designed to produce relatively high-grade structural material and sell the small proportion of boards that do not suffer seasoning degrade as furniture grade material. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate optimum seasoning of backsawn material specifically for furniture applications to take advantage of the premium prices paid by furniture manufacturers for degrade-free material. Acoustic emission is a well known non-destructive testing tool. Acoustic emission results from stress waves generated by irreversible stress release activity such as the growth of small cracks in a solid material under load. Acoustic emission is typically used in homogeneous materials such as plastics and metals to determine the structural integrity of components in situ. Acoustic emission was first measured in timber subject to external load over thirty years ago and has subsequently been measured in drying timber specimens where differential drying rates between the surface and centre of a sample may cause appreciable drying stresses. Acoustic emission appeared to be related to the severity of the drying conditions and the development of surface checking (Becker 1982, Noguchi et al. 1987). Under harsh drying regimes, surface checking occurred and a significantly higher AE rate was measured than in the same species subject to mild drying conditions. The 'AE rate' is a measure of the occurrence of high-energy bursts of acoustic waves during a particular time-period - the higher the AE rate, the more energetic bursts are measured. On this basis, it appeared feasible to measure acoustic emission in sample boards in a kiln during drying and adjust the drying conditions as the AE rate approached levels previously determined to correspond to surface checking. Various AE-based kiln control systems were reported in the literature (Honeycutt et al. 1985, Noguchi et al. 1987) but it appears acoustic emission was not satisfactorily related to surface check development. These control systems controlled the drying conditions based on arbitrary AE rates that were nominally selected as 'safe' without optimising the drying process. The heterogeneous structure of timber posed significant obstacles to forming a clear picture of the stress release processes occurring in timber. Acoustic emission measured in drying Tasmanian eucalypt boards was employed in this project as an online measure of the magnitude of the stresses during drying. Numerous batches of eucalypt boards were obtained from a sawmill during the project and dried under harsh conditions to induce surface checking. It was determined that the AE rate generated at the onset of surface checking in backsawn and quartersawn boards was effectively constant (within the variability of the material). This 'AE checking threshold' was independent of basic density and clearly independent of bulk stiffness (since the bulk tangential stiffness is effectively half the radial stiffness in the species studied). It appeared that the acoustic emission phenomenon was independent of the timber bulk material properties. It is proposed that acoustic emission waves propagate from irreversible slips or dislocations in the crystalline cellulose regions of cell walls under high stress. These slips are sudden, energetic stress release events which propagate stress waves from the local site. The amorphous regions of the cell structure behave in a rather plastic manner with local stress expected to be consumed by ductile flow processes that do not generate elastic waves. Dinwoodie (1968) reported the existence of such crystalline slips in spruce timber under external compression. Siau (1984) reported that the proportion by mass of cellulose in normal wood (as opposed to tension and compression wood) was remarkably constant and apparently independent of species. Further, the proportion of crystalline cellulose is also relatively constant (Siau 1984). This appears to be directly related to the remarkably constant AE rate measured at the onset of surface checking in this study. This finding led to the measurement of acoustic emission in other species. It was hoped that the same AE 'rate would be measured at the onset of checking in different woods. Acoustic emission was measured in backsawn radiata pine (Pinus radiata) and myrtle (Nothofagus cunninghamii). The acoustic emission measured in radiata pine was significantly different from the acoustic emission measured in the eucalypt material, with relatively 'massive' AE rates detected in boards free of seasoning degrade. This behaviour was attributed to brittle failure in the resin canals, structural elements not present in the eucalypt genus. The characteristic AE responses measured in drying myrtle boards resembled the behaviour measured in the eucalypt boards, apparently due to the more similar structure. Surface checking was detected at approximately the same AE rate as that measured in the eucalypt boards. Much of the improved understanding of the acoustic emission phenomenon developed in this study was facilitated by the existence of a one-dimensional nonlinear drying model developed by Oliver (1991). Oliver wrote KILNSCHED (KILN SCHEDULING PROGRAM), a computer program based on this model, which simulates the drying behaviour of a single board, with arbitrary bulk material properties, subject to arbitrary drying conditions. KILNSCHED is particularly suited to low temperature drying of eucalypt materials. Kiln drying trials quickly revealed that 'green' Tasmanian eucalypt boards invariably suffered surface checking within 24 hours when subject to drying temperatures as low as 23 °C dry bulb temperature and 21 °C wet bulb temperature (at 0. 5 m/s airspeed). Such temperatures are significantly lower than those often employed in drying material direct off-saw in the timber industry but none-the-less are considered 'harsh' in this study. At the commencement of this study, KILNSCHED was used in a purely predictive mode to assess drying schedules prior to drying. The author of this thesis modified KILNSCHED to simulate drying using the real-time drying temperatures measured in the experimental kiln. This allowed measured acoustic emission during drying to be compared with the drying behaviour calculated with KILNSCHED. This modification revealed that Tasmanian eucalypt timber is far more sensitive to small temperature fluctuations than was previously expected. The reader must keep this material sensitivity to temperature and temperature change in mind at all times when reading this thesis. The AE rate measured during drying was successfully related to the instantaneous strain at a board surface calculated with KILNSCHED using the measured drying conditions. Instantaneous strain is the strain component employed as the failure criterion in the drying model. This enabled the author to place considerable confidence in behaviour calculated with KILNSCHED and the 'optimum drying' program SMARTKILN discussed below. This author modified KILNSCHED to incorporate an optimisation algorithm that determined the optimum drying conditions required to dry the timber in the minimum time at a preset arbritrary maximum surface instantaneous strain. The resulting program, SMARTKILN, develops drying schedules to maintain the calculated surface instantaneous strain at a preset 'Control Strain' below the ultimate surface instantaneous strain. Together, SMARTKILN and acoustic emission measurement form the basis of Clever Kiln Controller®, a kiln control system to dry Tasmanian eucalypt timber in the minimum time with minimum degrade. In Clever Kiln Controller, SMARTKILN uses datalogged real time drying conditions to simulate the drying behaviour of a <b>sample</b> <b>board</b> in the kiln. Calculated drying behaviour is continuously compared with measured drying behaviour (measured AE rate and moisture profiles measured by regularly slicing sample boards). Provided the calculated and measured drying behaviour are satisfactorily matched, the optimum drying schedule developed by SMARTKILN is applied to the kiln. When the AE rate approaches the AE checking threshold, the drying conditions are automatically ameliorated to prevent surface checking. Subsequently, SMARTKILN develops a refined optimum schedule to incorporate the new datalogged drying conditions. This study has developed the understanding of acoustic emission from the existing (often misleading) information recorded in the literature to a level that could be incorporated with current knowledge of the behaviour of drying timber. The thesis describes how this was achieved. Various aspects of the understanding have been reported in papers published, in press or under review. The final result is the development of a commercial kiln controller which is described and already implemented in some selected experimental kilns at present restricted to eucalypt materials...|$|E

The current work research has been conducted to dry radiata pine sapwood in hot air and in modified oxygen-free drying medium, namely, gases A, B and C. Four sets of matched samples were dried at three different temperatures of 50, 70 and 90 °C, one set in a tunnel dryer simulating commercial hot air drying and three sets in a newly designed stainless steel cylinder, which was placed in an oven, for tests using the three oxygen-free drying media. The results show that no obvious KBS was detected near the surface of <b>sample</b> <b>boards</b> dried in all of the oxygen-free gases except for one run using gas B at 70 °C. However, for hot air drying, the discolouration of wood could only be reduced by drying at the low temperature of 50 °C. How kiln drying in air at or above 70 °C induces surface darkening and KBS. These results indicate that using an alternative non-oxygen atmosphere to kiln dry wood could reduce surface discolouration and KB...|$|R

A Kingston HyperX [...] "prosumer" [...] product using this controller was showcased at the Consumer Electronics Show 2014 and promised similar performance. Mushkin also showcased products using the SF 3700 series at CES, highligting their M.2 Helix series up to 480GB (512GiB) and up to 2TB in for the 2.5 inch format.|$|R
50|$|The edge {{crush test}} is a {{laboratory}} test method {{that is used}} to measure the cross-direction crushing of a <b>sample</b> of corrugated <b>board.</b> It gives information on the ability of a particular board construction to resist crushing. It provides some relationship with the peak top-to-bottom compression strength of empty singlewall regular slotted containers in laboratory conditions.|$|R
40|$|Five wood species {{originated}} from Jambi were observed for their machining properties in this study. Sawing characteristics (feed speed and surface smoothness) of each species were observed {{to determine its}} cuning-ability. Sawn timbers were then cut to <b>sample</b> <b>boards</b> and air-seasoned to appraximately 17 % moisture content prior to farther machining processes. The examined machining properties include planing, shaping, boring, turning and sanding. Examinalions were undergone according lo the modified ASTM D- 1666 as firstly described in the Forest Products Research lnstitute Report No. 160 (1982). Results ftom {{this study showed that}} most of the species could be sawn at mediwn feed speed with a variation in cutting surface quality, ranging from fair lo rough. One species, i. e., rengas pantai (Ghaa renghas) is fairly difficult to saw for its irregular (Partt interlocked) grain orietuation and the abundant deposition of silica (crystals) in its fiber structures. Some species consislenly showed good quatilies in almost all machining tests, and likely produced excelleni surface quality when worked out using sharp cutting tools and controlled machining condition. Wood samples tested in wet condition produced a fairly good planing and shaping quality for most wood species. In comparison, however, the air-dried samples significantly revealed a better machining quality. Based on the machinmg characteristics observed on the five wood specie from Jambi, it is recommendable to use rengas tembaga, sumpung and rengas manuk for woodworking purposes. Whereas, rengas pantai and kempas are more suitably intended for indoor structural uses...|$|R
40|$|Wood as {{a natural}} {{resource}} material can be modified by applying different drying techniques {{in order to have}} end products with improved properties. In wood drying industries, each parameter that has effect on end product quality and cost is elaborated intensively. In this context, stickers which are used to enable heat and moist air circulate through timber layers that are put in kilns for drying process are in concern, too. It {{is due to the fact}} that stickers are one of the major cost parameters in wood drying industries: not only the cost issue, but stickers also have direct effect on heat treatment process generated in kiln chambers, the total volume of timber that can be put in kilns and end product quality. This thesis makes both an evaluation and comparison for wood and aluminum sticker types which were used in heat treatment of Norway spruce boards by ThermoWood process. It was in interest to use wood and aluminum stickers in one single wood stack and make investigations on them broadly. Therefore, the evaluation of stickers and sticker stains was conducted in four different dimensions which were referred as chemical, physical, statistical (multivariate analysis approach) and economical research aspects. In chemical aspect, formation of the sticker stains was tried to be understood by literature reviews and a simple acidity test was made on sticker stained zones of <b>sample</b> <b>boards.</b> It was inferred that the sticker stain formation was generated due to a combination of both physical and chemical phenomenon which take place during drying. In the acidity test, the pH values of sticker underneath zones were lower (more acidic) than the sticker adjacent zones. However, the differences between pH values were not significant and both zones had pH values around 4 units. In physical aspect, color measurements were made on <b>sample</b> <b>boards</b> in subsequently increasing planing depths in order to investigate the severity degree of sticker stains on heat treated wood surface. These color measurements were made in L* C* h color space and the sticker stains’ severity degrees were successfully quantified by E*ab color difference values. The sufficient planing depth required to have a uniform looking heat treated surface without sticker stains was determined 1 - 2 mms. The other issues which might affect the sticker stain severity degree and planing process were discussed. In the statistical aspect, the data obtained from color measurements were used to make a multivariate analysis to investigate the variables which were influencing sticker stains and the relations between them. It was found that planing was the most influential factor on color variables. In the economical aspect, cost estimation and comparison were made for wood and aluminum stickers for short and long term utilization periods. The results indicated that aluminum stickers were costing less than wood stickers in long term utilization periods. However, it was also found out that the handling issues of stickers (installation-sticker removing and conveying systems) in sawmill operations was in great importance for a facility to make a decision for using a certain sticker type.
