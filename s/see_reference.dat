25|$|The case of simply-connected {{fillings}} {{is equivalent}} to Pu's inequality. Recently the case of genus-1 fillings was settled affirmatively, as well (<b>see</b> <b>reference</b> by Bangert et al. below). Namely, {{it turns out that}} one can exploit a half-century old formula by J. Hersch from integral geometry. Namely, consider the family of figure-8 loops on a football, with the self-intersection point at the equator (see figure {{at the beginning of the}} article). Hersch's formula expresses the area of a metric in the conformal class of the football, as an average of the energies of the figure-8 loops from the family. An application of Hersch's formula to the hyperelliptic quotient of the Riemann surface proves the filling area conjecture in this case.|$|E
25|$|In Saint John, New Brunswick in 1883, {{following}} {{the efforts of}} Colonel James Domville in procuring a collection of materials to replace the many private collections lost in the Great Fire of Saint John, New Brunswick the first free, tax-supported public library was established. Guelph, Ontario and Toronto, Ontario opened public libraries that same year as well. Due to Canada's size and diversity, {{the development of the}} modern Canadian public library was more of a slow evolution than a quick transition as each of the provinces' specific conditions (geographic, economic, cultural, demographic, etc.) had first to be addressed. The public library therefore took on many forms in Canada's earlier years; the three most prevalent of these forms were school-district libraries, Mechanics Institutes, and association/social libraries (<b>see</b> <b>reference</b> to Literary and Historical Society of Quebec above).|$|E

25|$|The final breach {{is often}} {{considered}} to have arisen after the capture and sacking of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204; the final break with Rome occurred circa 1450. The sacking of Church of Holy Wisdom and establishment of the Latin Empire as a seeming attempt to supplant the Orthodox Byzantine Empire in 1204 is viewed with some rancour to the present day. In 2004, Pope John Paul II extended a formal apology for the sacking of Constantinople in 1204, which was importantly also strongly condemned by the Pope at the time (Innocent III, <b>see</b> <b>reference</b> at end of paragraph); the apology was formally accepted by Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople. Many things that were stolen during this time —holy relics, riches, and many other items—were not returned and are still held in various European cities, particularly Venice.|$|E
500|$|Commonly carbon-containing {{compounds}} {{which are}} associated with minerals or which do not contain hydrogen or fluorine, are treated separately from classical organic compounds; the definition is not rigid (<b>see</b> <b>reference</b> articles above). Among these are the simple oxides of carbon. The most prominent oxide is carbon dioxide (...) [...] This was once the principal constituent of the paleoatmosphere, but is a minor component of the Earth's atmosphere today. Dissolved in water, it forms carbonic acid (...) , but as most compounds with multiple single-bonded oxygens on a single carbon it is unstable. Through this intermediate, though, resonance-stabilized carbonate ions are produced. Some important minerals are carbonates, notably calcite. Carbon disulfide (...) is similar.|$|E

This peaking concern is partially attributable to the fact much less was then known about world climate and causes of ice ages. Climate scientists were aware that predictions based on this trend were not possible - because the trend was poorly studied and not understood (for example <b>see</b> <b>reference).</b> Despite that, in the popular press the possibility of cooling was reported generally without the caveats present in the scientific reports, and [...] "unusually severe winters in Asia and parts of North America in 1972 and 1973...pushed the issue into the public consciousness".|$|E
2500|$|Sir Alan Cobham's Grappled-line looped-hose air-to-air {{refueling}} system {{borrowed from}} techniques patented by David Nicolson and John Lord, and was publicly demonstrated {{for the first}} time in 1935. In the system the receiver aircraft, at one time an Airspeed Courier, trailed a steel cable which was then grappled by a line shot from the tanker, a Handley Page Type W10. The line was then drawn back into the tanker where the receiver's cable was connected to the refueling hose. The receiver could then haul back in its cable bringing the hose to it. Once the hose was connected, the tanker climbed sufficiently above the receiver aircraft to allow the fuel to flow under gravity.
