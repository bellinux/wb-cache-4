5|$|Some {{species of}} fish are {{viviparous}}. In such species the mother retains the eggs and nourishes the embryos. Typically, viviparous fish have a structure analogous to the placenta seen in mammals connecting the mother's blood supply {{with that of the}} embryo. Examples of viviparous fish include the surf-perches, <b>splitfins,</b> and lemon shark. Some viviparous fish exhibit oophagy, in which the developing embryos eat other eggs produced by the mother. This has been observed primarily among sharks, such as the shortfin mako and porbeagle, but is known for a few bony fish as well, such as the halfbeak Nomorhamphus ebrardtii. Intrauterine cannibalism is an even more unusual mode of vivipary, in which the largest embryos eat weaker and smaller siblings. This behavior is also most commonly found among sharks, such as the grey nurse shark, but has also been reported for Nomorhamphus ebrardtii.|$|E
5|$|Most teleost {{species are}} oviparous, having {{external}} fertilisation with both eggs and sperm being {{released into the}} water for fertilisation. Internal fertilisation occurs in 500 to 600 species of teleosts but is more typical for Chondrichthyes and many tetrapods. This involves the male inseminating the female with an intromittent organ. Fewer than {{one in a million}} of externally fertilised eggs survives to develop into a mature fish, but there is a much better chance of survival among the offspring of members of about a dozen families which are viviparous. In these, the eggs are fertilised internally and retained in the female during development. Some of these species, like the live-bearing aquarium fish in the Poeciliidae family, are ovoviviparous; each egg has a yolk sac which nourishes the developing embryo, and when this is exhausted, the egg hatches and the larva is expelled into the water column. Other species, like the <b>splitfins</b> in the family Goodeidae, are fully viviparous, with the developing embryo nurtured from the maternal blood supply via a placenta-like structure that develops in the uterus. Oophagy is practised by a few species, such as Nomorhamphus ebrardtii; the mother lays unfertilised eggs on which the developing larvae feed in the uterus, and intrauterine cannibalism has been reported in some halfbeaks.|$|E

50|$|In the wild, {{both male}} and female redtail <b>splitfins</b> prefer to mate with fish of similar size. This limits the sexual {{advantage}} to males that grow especially large. This minimizes the sexual dimorphism {{in the size of the}} fish between males and females.|$|E
5000|$|Like other Goodeidae, {{butterfly}} <b>splitfins</b> mate {{by internal}} fertilization and spawn fully developed young. The females become sexually mature at {{about six months}} of age and can give birth every six to 10 weeks according to the water temperature and {{the condition of the}} fish. Mating is preceded by a courtship, where the males present themselves to the females with their heads pointing downwards [...] - [...] up to 45° from horizontal [...] - [...] and shake the forward part of their bodies. In that respect, they resemble the jeweled splitfin (Xenotoca variata); {{they do not have a}} ritualized [...] "courtship dance" [...] as some other <b>splitfins,</b> but the male sometimes rotates to present either flank to the female. The females respond by shaking their heads.|$|E

5000|$|Butterfly <b>splitfins</b> are voracious, and eat most {{forms of}} {{commercial}} fish food.
