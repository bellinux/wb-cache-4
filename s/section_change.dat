This cone and its conic <b>section</b> <b>change</b> with the seasons, as the Sun's declination changes; hence, sundials that follow the motion of such light-spots or shadow-tips often have different hour-lines for different times of the year. This is seen in shepherd's dials, sundial rings, and vertical gnomons such as obelisks. Alternatively, sundials may change the angle or position (or both) of the gnomon relative to the hour lines, as in the analemmatic dial or the Lambert dial.|$|E

For 14 bars, there is then a section for melody and accompaniment. Candélas then enters with two bars of [...] "Ah!"s. The piano then follows with two bars of octave chords. There is then a question and answer section between Candélas and the piano, one bar at a time, for 17 bars. There are then trills for the piano for a further 8 bars. A quaver, quaver rest, quaver, quaver rest pattern follows with straight crotchets for 8 bars. A melody then comes in above the base rhythm for 24 bars. The piano then has a large section of chords and (mainly) quavers for 33 bars. There are then trills for one bar and another quaver, quaver rest, quaver, quaver rest pattern with a straight crotchet accompaniment for 4 bars. There are then 20 bars of more trills. A section with melody and accompaniment then follows. The above section then repeats. However, at the repeat is not complete, as the third movement is then cut off half way through by an ascending scale of triplets for four bars.Here the tempo changes to Più mosso, ma giusto. This is the coda. Semi-quavers then follow for two three bar phrases of ascending scales. Candélas then has [...] "Ah!"s {{at the start of}} every other following bar for the next four bars. These bars finish with semi-quavers and then an ascending scale. There are then crotchet chords for 15 bars. A descending arpeggio and low final note finish the piece.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{development}} and the tailoring of a open source multidimensional CFD code {{to the analysis of}} the internal flow-field in hydraulic components. A preliminary study of two basic geometries is carried out by simulating the efflux of an incompressible fluid through circular pipes and through an abrupt <b>section</b> <b>change</b> determined by a small sharp-edged cylindrical orifice. A qualitative description of the internal flow-field distribution, and a quantitative comparison of pressure and velocity profiles along the pipe axis are used to asses the multidimensional open-source code capabilities. For the circular pipe the results are compared with experiments and with theoretical trends coming from literature fundamentals (Hagen-Poiseuille theory and Nikuradse interpolation), while for the abrupt <b>section</b> <b>change</b> experimental measurements available in literature are taken as a reference for the numerical accuracy determination. Furthermore, the influence of grid resolution and of turbulence models on the vena contracta on the characteristics recirculating regions, on the reattachment point and on the pressure and velocity fields is addressed. Afterwards, to investigate the mixing of different fluids, a preliminary analysis of a reference test case is carried out. The modified VOF approach, used for modeling the fluid-fluid mixing process, is tailored in order to account for turbulence. Different grid resolutions and turbulence models are adopted and results are compared with experiments in order to asses their influence on the interface and on the fluids distribution inside the reference geometrical domain. In particular, two different turbulence models (k-e – SST) are implemented in the original code to address their effect on actual fluids mixing. Finally, the dynamic behavior of a low pressure fuel rail is investigated and the fuels distribution history within the rail is determined for different operating conditions to assess both the fuel mixture at injectors’ inlet, and to highlight the differences among the cylinders in terms of injected fuel blend...|$|E

40|$|A {{graphene}} bilayer phototransistor (GBL-PT) {{is proposed}} and analyzed. The GBL-PT under consideration has {{the structure of}} a field-effect transistor with a GBL as the channel and the back and top gates. The positive bias of the back gate results in the formation of conducting source and drain sections in the channel, while the negatively biased top gate provides the potential barrier which is controlled by the charge of the photogenerated holes. The features of the GBL-PT operation are associated with the variations of both the potential distribution and the energy gap in different sections of the channel when the gate voltages and the charge in the barrier <b>section</b> <b>change.</b> Using the developed GBL-PT device model, the spectral characteristics, dark current, responsivity and detectivity are calculated as functions of the applied voltages, energy of incident photons, intensity of electron and hole scattering, and geometrical parameters.

40|$|Previous {{investigations}} {{of the flow of}} gases through sudden area changes in pipes are briefly reviewed, both unsteady and steady flow conditions being considered. The present paper concerns the effects of such area changes on single pressure waves of finite amplitude, and covers incident wave amplitudes greatly in excess of those previously investigated. Theoretically, the flow at the area change is assumed to be quasi-steady and one-dimensional, and two alternative treatments are presented. These are based respectively on reversible adiabatic (isentropic) and, more accurately, irreversible adiabatic conditions. Experiments using a simple shock tube confirm the validity of the more accurate theor-etical treatment over the range of area and incident pressure ratios considered, namely, 8. 1 and 2. 4 respectively. The theoretical treatment based on the assumption of isentropic flow at the <b>section</b> <b>change,</b> however, is inadequate in some respects. Discrepancies between theory and experiment are observed when considering, firstly, the reflected wave at an enlargement and, secondly, the transmitted wave at a contraction.
