In his History of the Filipino People Teodoro Agoncillo writes that the Filipino troops could match and even exceed American brutality on some prisoners of war. Kicking, slapping, and spitting at faces were common. In some cases, ears and noses were cut off and salt applied to the wounds. In other cases, captives were buried alive. These atrocities occurred regardless of Aguinaldo's orders and circulars concerning the good treatment of prisoners.|$|E
2500|$|Information {{reconciliation}} {{is a form}} {{of error}} correction carried out between Alice and Bob's keys, in order to ensure both keys are identical. It is conducted over the public channel and as such it is vital to minimise the information sent about each key, as this can be read by Eve. A common protocol used for information reconciliation is the cascade protocol, proposed in 1994. This operates in several rounds, with both keys divided into blocks in each round and the parity of those blocks compared. If a difference in parity is found then a binary search is performed to find and correct the error. If an error is found in a block from a previous round that had correct parity then another error must be contained in that block; this error is found and corrected as before. This process is repeated recursively, which {{is the source of the}} cascade name. After all blocks have been compared, Alice and Bob both reorder their keys in the same random way, and a new round begins. At the end of multiple rounds Alice and Bob have identical keys with high probability; however, Eve has additional information about the key from the parity information exchanged. However, from a coding theory point of view information reconciliation is essentially source coding with <b>side</b> <b>information,</b> in consequence any coding scheme that works for [...] this problem can be used for information reconciliation. Lately turbocodes, LDPC codes [...] and polar codes [...] have been used for this purpose improving the efficiency of the cascade protocol.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} scalable source coding with decoder <b>side</b> <b>informations.</b> Two special cases of this problem have been investigated in the literature, namely successive refinement Wyner-Ziv (SR-WZ) coding and side-information scalable (SI-scalable) coding, whose distinction lies in the degraded structure of the <b>side</b> <b>informations.</b> In this work, we first show the achievable region for the SI-scalable problem provided in a previous work is tight when either the first stage or the second stage requires lossless reconstruction. Then the notion of perfectly scalable coding is introduced as both the stages operate on the Wyner-Ziv bound, {{and a set of}} necessary and sufficient conditions is given for sources satisfying a mild support condition. Furthermore, generalizing the coding scheme for the SR-WZ and SI-scalable coding, we provide a conclusive solution for the (multi-stage) quadratic Gaussian scalable coding problem with arbitrary number of jointly Gaussian <b>side</b> <b>informations</b> (SI) in an arbitrary order of quality.

More specifically, a new fusion technique between temporal, homography and Disparity Compensation View Prediction (DCVP) <b>side</b> <b>informations</b> is introduced. For this purpose, a binary mask is computed at the encoder based on knowledge of the original video. This mask is compressed and then transmitted to the decoder. The latter merges the different <b>side</b> <b>informations</b> {{with the help of}} the reconstructed binary mask. The simulation results show that the fusion improves the rate-distortion performance over monoview DVC by a maximum gap of around 1. 0 dB. 1...|$|R

This is the average Kullback-Leibler divergence, or information gain, of the a posteriori probability distribution of X given the value of Y relative to the a priori distribution, or stated odds, on X. Notice that the expectation is taken over Y rather than X: we need to evaluate how accurate, in the long term, our <b>side</b> <b>information</b> Y is before we start betting real money on X. This is a straightforward application of Bayesian inference. Note that the <b>side</b> <b>information</b> Y might affect not just our knowledge of the event X but also the event itself. For example, Y might be a horse that had too many oats or not enough water. The same mathematics applies in this case, because from the bookmaker's point of view, the occasional race fixing is already taken into account when he makes his odds.|$|E

50|$|Under {{the mandate}} of list-decoding, for {{worst-case}} errors, the decoder is allowed to output a small list of codewords.

50|$|Precoding is a {{technique}} which exploits transmit diversity by weighting the information stream, i.e. the transmitter sends the coded information to the receiver to achieve pre-knowledge of the channel.

50|$|The {{nature of}} <b>side</b> <b>information</b> is {{extremely}} finicky. We {{have already seen}} that it can affect the actual event {{as well as our}} knowledge of the outcome.

We certainly do not want to bet all our money on that horse just upon a rumor: that informer may be betting on another horse, and may be spreading rumors just so he can get better odds himself. Instead, as we have indicated, we need to evaluate our <b>side</b> <b>information</b> in the long term to see how it correlates with the outcomes of the races. This way we can determine exactly how reliable our informer is, and place our bets precisely to maximize the expected logarithm of our capital according to the Kelly criterion. Even if our informer is lying to us, we can still profit from his lies if we can find some reverse correlation between his tips and the actual race results.|$|E
