25|$|On September 21, 2008, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, {{the last}} two major {{investment}} banks in the United States, both confirmed that they would become traditional bank holding companies. The Federal Reserve's approval of their bid to become banks ended the business model of an independent <b>securities</b> <b>firm,</b> 75 years after Congress separated them from deposit-taking lenders, and capped weeks of chaos that sent Lehman Brothers into bankruptcy {{and led to the}} rushed sale of Merrill Lynch & Co. to Bank of America Corp.|$|E

40|$|In {{securities}} markets, {{entities that}} can deal securities {{are limited to}} members of market associations like <b>securities</b> <b>firms</b> {{in order to maintain}} efficiency of their operation. Naturally, those <b>securities</b> <b>firms</b> hold <b>securities</b> not only for themselves but also for clients. Although clients should be the owners of their own securities, the Japanese legal system does not give a satisfactory explanation for the ownership of clients 2 ̆ 7 securities as such held by <b>securities</b> <b>firms</b> in certain situations. The main obstacle to this problem is that the <b>securities</b> <b>firms</b> necessarily deal with clients 2 ̆ 7 securities in the markets by their own names. Moreover, Japanese civil code obligates the <b>securities</b> <b>firms</b> as delegates to transfer assets which they obtain through market trades to their clients. It presumes that the <b>securities</b> <b>firms</b> obtain the property rights to the securities first then transfer them to their clients. This presumption, however, faces to a difficult problem when the <b>securities</b> <b>firms</b> go into bankruptcy before transferring the securities to their clients. 　This study will focus on the relationship between the <b>securities</b> <b>firms</b> and the clients and will argue to utilize trust theory to solve the problem as above. Especially, dual ownership construct of legal ownership and equitable interest is a useful concept for further study in relation to intangible assets such as money held by intermediaries...|$|R
40|$|A bank {{acquisition}} {{affects the}} combination of financial services that are offered, and the potential synergy between services. Consequently, an acquisition can affect the performance and risk of the bank. While much research is focused on bank acquisitions and other financial institutions, {{there is very little}} research on the performance following bank acquisitions of <b>securities</b> <b>firms.</b> Until recently, banks were restricted from acquiring <b>securities</b> <b>firms.</b> Thus, related research could only speculate on the effects from integrating bank and securities services, or measure the initial market response to related regulatory changes. It is found that the announcement effects when banks acquire <b>security</b> <b>firms</b> are not significant. Similar results are found for a matched sample of bank acquisitions of other banks. Second, bank acquirers of <b>security</b> <b>firms</b> do not experience a reduction in risk, offering no support for the diversification hypothesis. These results also hold when applying a cross-sectional analysis that controls for other characteristics of the acquirers. Third, banks that acquire <b>security</b> <b>firms</b> experience weaker performance following the acquisitions than banks that acquire other banks. The results may be attributed to the high level of risk of <b>securities</b> <b>firms</b> as independent entities, the high price paid to acquire these firms, and the difficulty in merging bank and securities operations and cultures. These findings do not refute the notion of beneficial synergies between banks and <b>security</b> <b>firms.</b> However, they may suggest that the favourable revaluations of banks as a result of signals about impending consolidation were excessive. Consequently, the price paid by banks for <b>security</b> <b>firm</b> targets may have been excessive, allowing a wealth transfer to the <b>security</b> <b>firm</b> shareholders before the wave of acquisitions occurred. In addition, the market may have underestimated the complications and cost resulting from the integration of security activities with banking activities. ...|$|R

Aside from the Section 21 prohibition on <b>securities</b> <b>firms</b> taking deposits, neither savings and loans nor state-chartered banks that {{did not belong to}} the Federal Reserve System were restricted by Glass–Steagall. Glass–Steagall also did not prevent <b>securities</b> <b>firms</b> from owning such institutions.

2500|$|A {{year before}} the law was passed, Citicorp, a {{commercial}} bank holding company, merged with the insurance company Travelers Group in 1998 to form the conglomerate Citigroup, a corporation combining banking, securities and insurance services under a house of brands that included Citibank, Smith Barney, Primerica, and Travelers. [...] Because this merger {{was a violation of}} the Glass–Steagall Act and the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, the Federal Reserve gave Citigroup a temporary waiver in September 1998. [...] Less than a year later, GLBA was passed to legalize these types of mergers on a permanent basis. The law also repealed Glass–Steagall's conflict of interest prohibitions [...] "against simultaneous service by any officer, director, or employee of a <b>securities</b> <b>firm</b> as an officer, director, or employee of any member bank".|$|E
50|$|The Consumer Federation of America {{and other}} {{commentators}} suggested <b>securities</b> <b>firms</b> had avoided becoming “financial holding companies” {{because they wanted}} to avoid Federal Reserve supervision as bank holding companies. The SEC (through its Chairman Arthur Levitt) had supported efforts to permit <b>securities</b> <b>firms</b> to engage in non-FDIC insured banking activities without the Federal Reserve’s “intrusive banking-style oversight” of the “overall holding company.” After the GLBA became law, <b>securities</b> <b>firms</b> continued (and expanded) their deposit and lending activities through the “unitary thrifts” and “nonbank banks” (particularly industrial loan companies) they had used before the GLBA to avoid regulation as bank holding companies. Alan Greenspan later noted <b>securities</b> <b>firms</b> only took on the “embrace” of Federal Reserve Board supervision as bank holding companies (and financial holding companies) after the financial crisis climaxed in September 2008.|$|R

2500|$|Bond markets, unlike {{stock or}} share markets, {{sometimes}} {{do not have}} a centralized exchange or trading system. Rather, in most developed bond markets such as the U.S., Japan and western Europe, bonds trade in decentralized, dealer-based over-the-counter markets. In such a market, market liquidity is provided by dealers and other market participants committing risk capital to trading activity. In the bond market, when an investor buys or sells a bond, the counterparty to the trade is almost always a bank or <b>securities</b> <b>firm</b> acting as a dealer. In some cases, when a dealer buys a bond from an investor, the dealer carries the bond [...] "in inventory", i.e. holds it for their own account. The dealer is then subject to risks of price fluctuation. In other cases, the dealer immediately resells the bond to another investor.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1990 case Advest, Inc. v.

[...] "We regard the standard of review undergirding these various formulations as identical, no matter how [...] their shadings," [...] wrote Bruce Selya. [...] "However nattily wrapped, the packages are fungible." [...] He derived a standard from the pleadings of the petitioner, a <b>securities</b> <b>firm</b> seeking to overturn an award to a former customer, {{to be applied to}} all such cases outside of labor arbitration.

2500|$|While {{permitting}} affiliations between securities {{firms and}} companies other than Federal Reserve member banks, Glass–Steagall distinguished between what a Federal Reserve member bank could do directly and what an affiliate could do. Whereas a Federal Reserve member bank could not buy, sell, underwrite, or deal in any security except as specifically permitted by Section 16, such a bank could affiliate {{with a company}} so long as that company was not [...] "engaged principally" [...] in such activities. Starting in 1987, the Federal Reserve Board interpreted this to mean a member bank could affiliate with a <b>securities</b> <b>firm</b> so long as that firm was not [...] "engaged principally" [...] in securities activities prohibited for a bank by Section 16. By the time the GLBA repealed the Glass–Steagall affiliation restrictions, the Federal Reserve Board had interpreted this [...] "loophole" [...] in those restrictions to mean a banking company (Citigroup, as owner of Citibank) could acquire one of the world's largest securities firms (Salomon Smith Barney).|$|E

2500|$|Stephen Friedman, {{a former}} {{director}} of Goldman Sachs, was named Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in January 2008. Although he had retired from Goldman in 1994, Friedman continued to own stock in the firm. Goldman's conversion from a <b>securities</b> <b>firm</b> to a bank holding company in September 2008 meant it was now regulated by the Fed and not the SEC. When it became apparent that Timothy Geithner, then president of the New York Fed, would leave his role there to become Treasury Secretary, Friedman was granted a temporary one-year waiver of a rule that forbids [...] "class C" [...] directors of the Fed from direct interest with those it regulates. Friedman agreed to remain on the board until the end of 2009 to provide continuity {{in the wake of the}} turmoil caused by Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy. Had the waiver not been granted, the New York Fed would have lost both its president and its chairman (or Friedman would have had to divest his Goldman shares). This would have been highly disruptive for the New York Fed's role in the capital markets. Friedman later said he agreed to stay on the NY Fed board out of a sense of public duty, but that his decision was [...] "being mischaracterized as improper".|$|E
