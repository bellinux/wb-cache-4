This papers discusses the application of <b>speciality</b> <b>paper</b> in architectural and interior designs, and as important materials, <b>speciality</b> <b>paper</b> is to become a trend in the design fields in the future, which is significant in aspects of improving people’s living environment and environmental protection. The invention of paper can be called {{as one of the most}} important inventions in human history. Along with the development of science and technology, paper is used in every aspect of human society. In the recent years, <b>speciality</b> <b>paper</b> rises as a new force in the green-material market, and it develops so fast that great influences are exerted on industries of architectural and interior designs. Specility paper differs from plain paper in raw materials, paper characteristics, performance, application et al. because of its reproducibility, high technology content and additional value, <b>speciality</b> <b>paper</b> can be used widely in areas such as industry, agriculture, architecture, interior decoration, medical treatment, food, advanced designs, and is of high potential in its future development.

40|$|The ferti-irrigational {{effect of}} an agro-based <b>paper</b> <b>mill</b> {{effluent}} on Abelmoschus esculentus (var. IHR- 31) was investigated. Different doses of <b>paper</b> <b>mill</b> effluent viz. 5, 10, 25, 50, 75 and 100 % {{were used for}} fertigation of A. esculentus along with bore well water (control). The study revealed that <b>paper</b> <b>mill</b> effluent had significant (p +, K +, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Fe 2 +, TKN, PO 4 3 ¯, SO 4 2 ¯, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn and Zn of the soil in both seasons. Insignificant (p> 0. 05) changes in WHC and bulk density of the soil were observed after irrigation with <b>paper</b> <b>mill</b> effluent. The agronomical performance of A. esculentus was increased from 5 to 25 % and decreased from 50 to 100 % concentration of <b>paper</b> <b>mill</b> effluent as compared to control in both seasons. The heavy metals concentration was increased in A. esculentus from 5 to 100 % concentrations of <b>paper</b> <b>mill</b> effluent in both seasons.

The order of Contamination Factor (Cf) of various heavy metals was Cr>Cd>Mn>Zn>Cu for soil and Zn>Mn>Cu>Cr>Cd for A. esculentus plants after fertigation with <b>paper</b> <b>mill</b> effluent. Therefore, <b>paper</b> <b>mill</b> effluent {{can be used as}} a biofertigant after appropriate dilution to improve yield of A. esculentus...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In general, <b>paper</b> <b>mill</b> {{wastewater}} contains complex {{organic substances}} {{which could not}} be treated completely using conventional treatment processes, e. g. aerobic processes. As a result, anaerobic technology is a promising alternative for <b>paper</b> <b>mill</b> wastewater treatment due to its ability to degrade hard organic compounds. In the present study, treatment of <b>paper</b> <b>mill</b> wastewater using a stage anaerobic reactor was investigated. The more specific objectives of this study were to confirm whether <b>paper</b> <b>mill</b> wastewater can be tolerated by methanogenic sludge and to assess the stability of reactor for measured parameters (e. g. COD removal, and methane composition). Results showed up to 98 % COD removal efficiency in the anaerobic reactor when the reactor was operated at an OLR of 1. 560 kg COD/m 3. d. Anaerobic digestion can provide high treatment efficiency for recalcitrant substrates, which generates robust microorganism (acidogenesis and methanogenesis), for the degradation of recalcitrant compounds such as in the <b>paper</b> <b>mill</b> wastewater. Key words: Anaerobic digestion; <b>Paper</b> <b>mill</b> wastewater; Recalcitrant compound...|$|R
