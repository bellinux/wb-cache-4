40|$|ABSTRACT Examining the Effects of Anxiety on Running Efficiency in a Cognitive-motor Dual-task Mai-Linh Dovan Dual-tasking is {{commonly}} defined as performing two tasks simultaneously and is commonplace in simple {{activities of daily}} living such as walking across the street while talking on a cell phone. When even simple motor tasks such as standing or walking are coupled with a mental task (cognitive-motor dual-task), performance of one or both tasks decreases because total available attention is limited. Dual-task performance {{has been shown to be}} affected by anxiety created by a physically threatening or disturbing environment. This can be explained by the attention-consuming effect of anxiety. Few studies have examined whether “performance anxiety” may have similar effects. This study examined the effects of performance-related anxiety on running when performed concurrently with a math task. Twenty-nine healthy university level <b>students</b> <b>participated</b> <b>voluntarily</b> in this study. Participants ran on a treadmill at a 20...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Reading errors like {{switching}} letters is {{a persistent}} characteristic of errors for dyslectics (Braams, 2001). This type of error {{can be explained}} by the magnocellular theory (Stein, 2001; Stein, Talcott, & Walsh, 2000). The font “Dyslexie ” is developed to increase the reading accuracy and readability of texts for dyslectics, so that the errors by switching letters are reduced. Aim: To examine difference in reading speed and accuracy between dyslectics and normal readers, while reading printed words and non-words in the fonts “Dyslexie ” and Arial. Sample: Twenty-one dyslectic and twenty-two normal reading <b>students</b> <b>participated</b> <b>voluntarily</b> or received European Credits or money Method: Students read the reading tests EMT and Klepel twice. Once printed in the font Arial and once in the font “Dyslexie”. The order was randomly assigned. In-between the reading tests an auditory task was fulfilled. Results: No significant difference in speed was measured, but there were some positive and negative effects found for the interaction font and dyslexia on the accuracy for reading words and non-words. Conclusion: Reading with the font “Dyslexie ” does not improve the reading speed for reading words. However some specific type of reading errors are decreased, but others are increased. Overall the dyslectics read fewer errors while reading the words printed in the font “Dyslexie”.

Material and Methods: 93 <b>students</b> <b>participated</b> <b>voluntarily</b> in the study from three different sports clubs. The ages in which the participants started basketball varied between 10 and 13, and their durations of weekly trainings differed from each other. The end-of-the-year academic success average points of the participants were considered in determining the academic success levels; and the International Physical Performance Test Profile (IPPTP) (Kamar, 2008) was used in measuring the motoric skills. The issue of whether there was a significant difference between the participants was determined by using the SPSS 21. 0 Package Program together with the One-Way ANOVA Test. Results: According to the findings, it was determined that there were no relations between the academic success rates and the basketball playing durations, the number of weekly trainings, and their motoric skills (p> 0. 05). On the other hand, a statistically significant difference was determined between the age variable and the academic success levels (p< 0. 05). Conclusions: No significant differences were detected between the motoric skills, number of trainings, starting basketball dates and the academic success levels of the sportsmen who receive basic basketball training (which contribute to the development of motoric skills) with different numbers of weekly training and with different basketball starting dates; while a negative significance was detected between the age variable and academic success...|$|E
40|$|Engaging {{students}} in reading permits students to experience reading {{in a more}} meaningful manner as well as develop their identity as effective readers. Currently, the teaching of reading does not allow students to experience reading in an engaging and meaningful manner because the process of retrieving the required information {{at the end of}} the reading text has hindered them from experiencing reading in this manner. This exploratory study presents an approach to facilitate students‟ reading engagement through the employment of epistolary writing. The purpose was to explore the employment of epistolary writing in facilitating ESL students‟ reading engagement. The students wrote their understanding and interpretation of printed texts in the form of a letter to their instructor. Three third year <b>students</b> <b>participated</b> <b>voluntarily</b> in this case study. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and documents such as students‟ letters, instructor's reflective notes, and pre-teaching and post-teaching questionnaires.

The numbers in the QS summaries correspond to numbers placed {{in the body of}} the document where the summarized ideas are discussed in full. Aim. To examine the influence of QS summaries on participants’ perceptions of text quality (i. e., comprehensibility, structure, and interest) and recall, an experimental – control group design compared the effects of a QS text with a structured abstract (SA) text. Sample. Forty psychology <b>students</b> <b>participated</b> <b>voluntarily</b> or received course credits. Method. Students first read a control (SA) or experimental (QS) text on flashbulb memory (FBM). Next, their perceptions of text quality were measured through a questionnaire. Recall was assessed with an open answer test with items for facts, comprehension and higher order information. Results. Perceptions of text quality did not vary across conditions. But QS did lead to significantly and substantially (d= 1. 57) higher overall recall scores. Participants with the QS text performed significantly better on all item types than participants with the SA text. Conclusion. Studying a QS text led to a substantial improvement in recall compared to an SA text. Further research is needed to examine how readers study QS texts and whether a text model hypothesis or a repetition effect hypothesis accounts for the effectiveness. The first hypothesis posits that the QS summaries support the reader in constructing a text schema. The second attributes the effects of these summaries to their repetition of text topic...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Students and {{university}} community are social {{and human resources}} of the country. The students’ viewpoints {{about the quality of}} educational services can be considered as a basis for planning quality promotion and improving organizational performance. This study was conducted to determine the quality gap in educational services by the students of Health and Nutrition School of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 140 <b>students</b> <b>participated</b> <b>voluntarily</b> (age range= 19 to 40 years). The service quality (SERVQUAL) questionnaire was used for data collection. This questionnaire measured the quality gap in 5 dimensions of educational service including assurance, responsiveness, empathy, reliability, and tangibility. The students’ perception about the current conditions and their expectations as to optimal conditions can be determined, using this questionnaire. The score of the gap in quality of educational services is calculated from difference between perception and expectation scores. Due to non-normality of data, non-parametric tests were used. To this end, data were analyzed by statistical tests including Wilcoxon, Friedman, Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whiteny tests in SPSS 14. Results: The results showed that there was quality gap in all 5 dimensions of educational services. The largest and the smallest gaps were observed in "responsiveness" with a mean±SD of - 0. 94 ± 0. 74 and in "reliability" with a mean±SD of - 0. 76 ± 0. 69, respectively. There was a significant difference in quality gap between the 5 dimensions (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: According to the results, the students’ expectations were higher than their perceptions of current conditions; also, in all aspects of the services their expectations were not met. It is recommended that workshops on customer services, communication skills and personnel’s technical skills development should be planned and held. Also, allocating more resources for improving educational facilities and physical environment is recommended...|$|E

When compared to national estimates, the prevalence of a positive screen for MDD was over five-fold higher in medical trainees compared to age-matched controls (16 % vs. 2. 8 %, p< 0. 0001). Similarly, the prevalence of a positive screen for GAD was over eight-fold higher in medical trainees (19 % vs. 2. 3 %, p< 0. 0001). The prevalence was consistently higher within age strata. 33. 3 % of postgraduates and 32 % of MS {{believe there is a}} significant impact of depression or anxiety on their academic performance.

The participants in this study were college <b>students</b> who <b>participated</b> <b>voluntarily.</b> A questionnaire on motivation (AMTB) created by Robert Gardner (1985) was given to the students as a pre-test/post-test in order to obtain quantitative measures. Also, a researcher was present during the computer laboratory sessions and a group discussion was conducted at the end of the study to collect qualitative samples. Four classes consisting of a total of 143 <b>students</b> <b>participated</b> in this study. The second language was French and the level was 103, a level intended for students who already had taken French in high school. French 103 reviews in one semester the material that is covered by students in French 101 and French 102 during two semesters. ^ The four classes were divided into two groups, an experimental group and a control group. The study was conducted in a computer laboratory, where each of the four classes attended once a week. The experiment was conducted over an eight-week period at the beginning of the Spring semester 1997, from January 14 to March 4. Both classes from the control group, one arriving at 9 : 30 a. m. and the other at 1 : 30 p. m., were exposed to regular classroom material; nothing was done to modify the procedure of the classes 2 ̆ 7 activities. The two experimental classes, one at 8 : 30 a. m. and the other at 11 : 30 a. m., both received a treatment of ten minutes at the end of the computer class period. ^ The statistical results of the study did not support the hypothesis that the use of a different cultural input would increase the students 2 ̆ 7 motivation, but the qualitative part of the study provided a fountain of information. Information which demanded reflection. Information which contributed to my personal development as a researcher, as an observer, and, most importantly, as a teacher. ...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study is}} twofold. First, it is aimed to observe how pre-service teacher trainees interacted within the system when they are given the tool to organize their own communities of learning. Secondly, what are their perceptions of using the system? 65 university <b>students</b> <b>voluntarily</b> <b>participated</b> in this qualitative study. The data was gathered through server statistics, personal interviews, and an open-ended questionnaire. The analyses included descriptive statistics for quantitative and content analysis for the qualitative data. The findings indicate that participants embraced the notion of forming and being part of a learning community, were willing to participate in using the system in their courses, and suggested some improvements for better use of the system...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine {{prospective}} early childhood educators' attitudes towards teaching multicultural classes using the planned behavior theoretical framework. One hundred and forty-eight undergraduate <b>students</b> <b>voluntarily</b> <b>participated</b> in the study. Participants were divided into two groups. The first group comprised students who attended courses on multicultural education, whereas the second group comprised students who did not attend those courses. A specifically designed questionnaire was administered to assess attitudes toward teaching multicultural classes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and self-assessed knowledge. Results showed that the planned behavior model can be applied to the multicultural domain. Self-assessed knowledge significantly increased the predictability of the prospective students' intentions only for the first group (R 2 =. 61). It was concluded that prospective early educators' participation in courses regarding cultural diversity facilitated their attitudes towards teaching children from various cultural backgrounds...|$|R
