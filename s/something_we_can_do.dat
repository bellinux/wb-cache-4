40|$|Ernst Cassirer (1944), in {{his article}} {{discussing}} the role of group theory in perception, asserts that the primitive form of understanding {{is that of the}} intuitive concept of a group. The usefulness of the group concept in contemporary mathematics and theoretical physics offers strong support to the validity of this insight. One of the chief functions of group theory in mathematics and physics has been to describe what properties of objects, events, or even natural laws remain invariant, or symmetrical, across different domains, or under modification by transformations. In geometry, Felix Klein, in pursuing his Eriangen program, succeeded in showing that different geometries can be represented by specific groups of tra~sformations which leave only certain geometric properties of objects invariant when applied. Consequently, Herman Weyl provided a very simple definition of the term "invariant, " indicating that it is merely a synonym of the term "symmetrical, " namely, that a thing is symmetrical i f there is <b>something</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> to it so that after we have done it, it appears the same as it did b e f ~ r e. ~ The precise statement of what the thing is, an...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We may get {{significant}} {{guidance from}} industry on {{the requirement for}} NDT skills, training, certification, costs and standards; {{on the other hand}} being as we are the experts, we may need to encourage or even persuade industry as to what is best for them. In either case, our role is clear; we are here to represent industry, ensuring that they get affordable NDT that meets legislative requirements. The cost of training, specifically that associated with Specialist Methods, like Time of Flight Diffraction (TOFD) and Phased Array, is very high and in some cases prohibitive; is there <b>something</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> about this or are we content that high training costs will in some cases dissuade some companies from training their operatives appropriately? In the UK, British NDT Standards have almost entirely been superseded by European Norm Standards; this is okay, it makes it a lot easier for European countries to work across Europe rather than simply in their own country. However, many industries work worldwide and therefore have to conform to both EN standards and ISO standards; so how is the divergence of EN 473 and ISO 9712 helping this process? In the UK, the training and standards issues are not helped by an acknowledged skills shortage and the lack of new entrants to NDT; the age profile is alarmingly high and it is noticeable that there are very few young people entering the profession. This paper discusses the difficulties industry has in maintaining an NDT certificated workforce in the light of spiralling NDT training costs and skills shortages; it also discusses the conformity issues relating to EN and ISO standards. Don’t forget, we are supposed to be representing industry. 1...|$|E

40|$|In ethical theory one {{deals with}} {{questions}} about what is good or rational to do by referring to practical reasons. Bernard Williams's Internalism is such a theory of practical reasons. His main claim is that practical reasons are conditionally normative -they must rest on a psychological foundation. If we say of someone that they have reason to <b>do</b> <b>something,</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> only <b>do</b> that if the person himself could, by some sort of sound reasoning, concur with such a judgement. Externalism of practical reasons does not have such a requirement. What people have reasons to do is provided by truth independently of any person's psychological make up. In this thesis I argue that internalism is right in forcing a psychological demand on ethical theories. In essence this means that ethical theory needs pedagogy, and that internalism is that which meets such a demand best. However, internalism might be basing itself on a wrong picture of psychology. McDowell accepts the psychological demand on ethical theories, but he offers a different account of psychology that is more congenial to the externalist interpretation of reasons...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The goal of {{this project}} {{is to show that}} a general system of smart cells can be {{designed}} to cooperate to perform an arbitrarily complex, sequential, producer−consumer process that automatically performs adaptive load balancing. In more plain terms, a bunch of mobile agents can be programmed so that they can automatically turn themselves into an assembly line. That assembly line can repair itself if some parts fail, without central control or human interference. To demonstrate this goal, we shall build chemical factories (in simulation) using smart cells. It is difficult, through normal human−controlled chemical means, to reliably, precisely and efficiently construct molecules such as hydrocarbons, proteins and other small molecules. In this system, the product of one stage of reactions is needed to execute the second stage, but the two cannot occur at the same cell. While the ability to control such reactions within cells is not <b>something</b> that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> in the wet−lab yet, it is nevertheless likely to be something that is doable in the next several years. The cells in this system will have the ability to signal each other by sending chemicals out into their environment. They will also be able to monitor and modify their own state. We would like to see if these smart cells would develop into sensible morphologies and whether or not those morphologies would restore themselves should cells die. One of the main differences in approaching amorphous computing from the centralized contro...|$|R
40|$|My early {{research}} in film focused on ways of using found footage; Following Your Heart extends this exploration. Many artists who use found footage simply cut it together. My film is more orchestrated: {{the sound is}} perfected in a recording studio and the rhythms are all adjusted to fit so it is bound into a stronger whole. I bring together a variety of material, from adverts for mobile phones, credit cards, bread, and new DVDs, to Fantastic Voyage, the classic film about a miniature craft inserted into a person. The work’s central conceit is to take found footage and manipulate it into a new artistic experience while unpicking the common contradictions of mass media. The video is a fast orchestration of elements that use the verve and life of the original adverts but in a lyrical fashion. The adverts all relate to the ‘heart’ in some way, either in terms of health or, in the usual capitalistic fashion, by asking people to consume by appealing to the emotions. Yet, as the piece intimates, following your heart has consequences – it is not <b>something</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> always <b>do,</b> in shops or in life. The messages start to collide and contradict. Consumerism wants us to act on impulse, to just do it, yet this is a dark message if people are cajoled into applying it to other aspects of their life. The research contributes to a wider critique of Western society: in a pleasurable way it points to the moral vacuum that would ensue if one treated loved ones as commodities to be cashed in or dropped as we wish...|$|R
40|$|Upper {{division}} {{courses in}} college are where math majors learn real mathematics. For {{the first time}} they get to examine the foundations of algebra, geometry and analysis, come face-to-face with the deductive nature of mathematics on a consistent basis and, most importantly, learn to do serious theorem-proving. For reasons not unlike these, most mathematicians enjoy teaching these courses more than others. While teaching graduate courses may be professionally more satisfying, it also involves more work, and the teaching of lower division courses — calculus and elementary discrete mathematics — is a strenuous exercise in the suppression of one’s basic mathematical impulses. By contrast, the teaching of upper division courses involves no more than doing elementary mathematics the usual way: abstract definitions can be offered without apology and theorems are proved as a matter of principle. This is <b>something</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> all <b>do</b> on automatic pilot. But have we been on automatic pilot for too long? Mathematicians approach these courses as a training ground for future mathematicians. Even a casual perusal of the existing textbooks would readily confirm this fact. We look at upper division courses as the first steps of a journey of ten thousand miles: in order to give students a firm foundation for future research, we feed them technicality after technicality. If they do not fully grasp {{some of the things they}} are taught, they will when they get to graduate school or, if necessary, a few years after they start their research. Then they will put everything together. In short, we build the undergraduate education program for our majors on the principle of delayed gratification. Whatever their misgivings for the time being, students will benefit in the long haul. This is the abbreviated version of a longer paper [W 4] which discusses the same issues from a slightly different perspective, that of training prospective school teachers. I am indebted t...|$|R

6000|$|... "These be pessimistic pronouncements," [...] you say. Well, no, not exactly. For, after all, we {{must never}} shut our eyes to the actual; {{and in the world}} as it is, meliorism, not optimism, is the true {{opposite}} of pessimism. Optimist and pessimist are both alike in a sense, seeing they are both conservative; they sit down contented--the first with the smug contentment that says [...] "All's well; I have enough; why this fuss about others?" [...] the second with the contentment of blank despair that says, [...] "All's hopeless; all's wrong; why try uselessly to mend it?" [...] The meliorist attitude, on the contrary, is rather to say, [...] "Much is wrong; much painful; what <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> to improve it?" [...] And {{from this point of view}} there is <b>something</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> all <b>do</b> to make martyrdom less inevitable in the end, for the man who has a thought, a discovery, an idea, to tell us. Such men are rare, and their thought, when they produce it, is sure to be unpalatable. For, if it were otherwise, it would be thought of our own type--familiar, banal, commonplace, unoriginal. It would encounter no resistance, as it thrilled on its way through our brain, from established errors. What the genius and the prophet are there for is just that--to make us listen to unwelcome truths, to compel us to hear, to drive awkward facts straight home with sledge-hammer force to the unwilling hearts and brains of us. Not what you want to hear, or what I want to hear, is good and useful for us; but what we don't want to hear, what we can't bear to think, what we hate to believe, what we fight tooth and nail against. The man who makes us listen to that is the seer and the prophet; he comes upon us like Shelley, or Whitman, or Ibsen, and plumps down horrid truths that half surprise, half disgust us. He shakes us out of our lethargy. To such give ear, though they say what shocks you. Weigh well their hateful ideas. Avoid the vulgar vice of sneering and carping at them. Learn to examine their nude thought without shrinking, and examine it all the more carefully when it most repels you. Naked verity is an acquired taste; it is never beautiful at first sight to the unaccustomed vision. Remember that no question is finally settled; that no question is wholly above consideration; that what you cherish as holiest is most probably wrong; and that in social and moral matters especially (where men have been longest ruled by pure superstitions) new and startling forms of thought have the highest a priori probability in their favour. Dismiss your idols. Give every opinion its fair chance of success--especially when it seems to you both wicked and ridiculous, recollecting that it is better to let five hundred crude guesses run loose about the world unclad, than to crush one fledgling truth in its callow condition. To the Greeks, foolishness: to the Jews, a stumbling-block. If you can't be one of the prophets yourself, you can at least abstain from helping to stone them.|$|R
