40|$|SummaryThe {{benefits}} and costs of stratification of affected-sib-pair (ASP) data were examined in three situations: (1) {{when there is no}} difference in identity-by-descent (IBD) allele sharing between stratified and unstratified ASP data sets; (2) when there is an increase in IBD allele sharing in one of the stratified groups; and (3) when the <b>data</b> are <b>stratified</b> on the basis of IBD allele-sharing status at one locus, and the stratified ASPs are then analyzed for linkage at a second locus. When there is no difference in IBD sharing between strata, a penalty is always paid for <b>stratifying</b> the <b>data.</b> The loss of power to detect linkage in the <b>stratified</b> ASP <b>data</b> sets is the result of multiple testing and the smaller sample size within individual strata. In the case in which etiologic heterogeneity (i. e., severity of phenotype, age at onset) represents genetic heterogeneity, the power to detect linkage can be increased by <b>stratifying</b> the ASP <b>data.</b> This benefit is obtained when there is sufficient IBD allele sharing and sample sizes. Once linkage has been established for a given locus, <b>data</b> can be <b>stratified</b> on the basis of IBD status at this locus and can be tested for linkage at a second locus. When the relative risk is in the vicinity of 1, the power to detect linkage at the second locus is always greater for the unstratified ASP data set. Even for values of the relative risk that diverge sufficiently from 1, with adequate sample sizes and IBD allele sharing, the benefits of <b>stratifying</b> ASP <b>data</b> are minimal...|$|R

We seek to estimate accuracy and select instances for labeling in a loop via a continuously refined stratified sampling strategy. For <b>stratifying</b> <b>data</b> we develop a novel strategy of learning r bit hash functions to preserve similarity in accuracy values. We show that our algorithm provides better accuracy estimates than existing methods for learning distance preserving hash functions. Experiments on {{a wide spectrum of}} real datasets show that our estimates achieve between 15 % and 62 % relative reduction in error compared to existing approaches. We show how to perform stratified sampling on unlabeled data that is so large that in an interactive setting even a single sequential scan is impractical. We present an optimal algorithm for performing importance sampling on a static index over the data that achieves close to exact estimates while reading three orders of magnitude less data.

40|$|Capture-recapture {{methods are}} {{frequently}} employed to estimate abundance of cetaceans using photographic techniques {{and a variety}} of statistical models. However, there are many unresolved issues regarding the selection and manipulation of images that can potentially impose bias on resulting estimates. To examine the potential impact of these issues we circulated a test data set of dorsal fin images from bottlenose dolphins to several independent research groups. Photo-identification methods were generally similar, but the selection, scoring, and matching of images varied greatly amongst groups. Based on these results we make the following recommendations. Researchers should: (1) determine the degree of marking, or level of distinctiveness, and use images of sufficient quality to recognize animals of that level of distinctiveness; (2) ensure that markings are sufficiently distinct to eliminate the potential for “twins” to occur; (3) <b>stratify</b> <b>data</b> sets by distinctiveness and generate a series of abundance estimates to investigate the influence of including animals of varying degrees of markings; and (4) strive to examine and incorporate variability among analysts into capture-recapture estimation.

30|$|A major {{limitation}} to {{the present}} study was the inability to compare emotional conditions to neutral conditions.

Another limitation was the amount of artifact encountered by taking N 2 d difference waves for hypothesis two.

Previous research has included the use of a feedback tone for slow responses to “Go” stimuli, which helps to elicit the N 2 ERP more reliably and effectively [28]. The last main limitation to this study was the sampling bias of including summer semester students who were also student athletes. Compared to women, a larger proportion of these student athletes were men, and <b>stratifying</b> <b>data</b> by sex for hypothesis one resulted in more consistent findings for women than men.

40|$|In this thesis, we {{are mainly}} {{interested}} in representing and stratifying objects, states, and events. From an epistemological or perceptual perspective, {{states may be}} seen as "time stamped data" or "basic observations". Perception and cognition organize sensory outputs by grouping them in units that allow us to interact with the world in a quick and fruitful way. Similarly, states can be organized by synchronically grouping them into complex configurations of the world, or diachronically grouping them into events. We are specially interested in the logical forms of existential dependencies between states, objects and events. In the view of some philosophers, the world is stratified in levels by means of existential dependencies. This view is also present in theories of granularity, where (i) an abstraction mechanism allows for the simplification of fine-grained (lower level) entities into coarser (higher level) entities, stratifying entities in levels of abstraction; or (ii) data resolution is considered a criterion for <b>stratifying</b> <b>data</b> in levels of granularity, reflecting a more epistemological perspective on levels.

40|$|Assessing {{treatment}} {{effects in}} observational studies is a multifaceted problem {{that not only}} involves heterogeneous mechanisms of how the treatment or cause is exposed to subjects, known as propensity, but also differential causal effects across sub-populations. We introduce a concept termed the facilitating score to account for both the confounding and interacting impacts of covariates on the treatment effect. Several approaches for estimating the facilitating score are discussed. In particular, we put forward a machine learning method, called causal inference tree (CIT), to provide a piecewise constant approximation of the facilitating score. With interpretable rules, CIT splits data {{in such a way}} that both the propensity and the treatment effect become more homogeneous within each resultant partition. Causal inference at different levels can be made on the basis of CIT. Together with an aggregated grouping procedure, CIT <b>stratifies</b> <b>data</b> into strata where causal effects can be conveniently assessed within each. Besides, a feasible way of predicting individual causal effects (ICE) is made available by aggregating ensemble CIT models.
