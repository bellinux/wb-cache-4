Subjects with high- (Highs) and low (Lows) -susceptibilities to hypnosis have shown {{different levels of}} skill at visual and somesthetic-guided imageries performed during upright stance. The aim of this experiment is to study the modulation of the EEG alpha and theta band amplitude during guided visual and <b>somesthetic</b> imageries in Highs and Lows, as these rhythms are responsive to the cognitive activities involved in mental imagery. Our results show that, at variance with standing subjects, subjects in both groups in a semi-reclined position report higher vividness and lower effort for visual than for <b>somesthetic</b> imagery. EEG patterns however are different between the two groups. Highs exhibit a more widespread alpha desynchronization and slightly different EEG patterns during visual and <b>somesthetic</b> imageries, while Lows show segregated alpha- and theta-desynchronization, without any difference between the tasks. Our results indicate that different, hypnotizability-related cognitive strategies, that are revealed by differences in EEG modulation, {{are responsible for the}} similar subjective experience associated with visual and <b>somesthetic</b> imageries in Highs and Lows. In addition, in both groups higher order mental representation of different sensory modalities might be subserved by a unique integrated neural network...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Despite {{consensus}} {{regarding the}} interference of cognitive processes {{on the human}} balance, the impact that different sensory stimuli have on the stabilometric measures remains unclear. Here, we investigated changes in the postural balance of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in healthy controls undergoing different proprioceptive and <b>somesthetic</b> pitfalls. We included 17 subjects submitted to eight sensorimotor dynamics with differences in the support bases, contact surfaces, and visual clues. The measurements used to assess participants balance were as follows: position {{of the body in}} space, range of instability, area of the support base, and velocity of postural control. From a total of 56 cross-sectional analyses, 21. 42 % pointed out differences between groups. Longitudinal analyses showed that tasks with proprioceptive and <b>somesthetic</b> pitfalls similarly impact imbalance in both groups. The current results suggest that AD subjects and healthy controls had different patterns submitted to balance, but suffered similar interference when undergoing proprioceptive and <b>somesthetic</b> challenges...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the contribution of otolithic and <b>somesthetic</b> inputs {{in the perception of}} body orientation when pitching at very slow velocities. In Experiment 1, the subjects' task was to indicate their subjective postural vertical, in two different conditions of body restriction, starting from different angles of body tilt. In the "strapped" condition, subjects were attached onto a platform by means of large straps. In the "body cast" condition, subjects were completely immobilized in a depressurized system, which attenuates gravity-based <b>somesthetic</b> cues. Results showed that the condition of body restriction and the initial tilt largely influenced the subjective postural vertical. In Experiment 2, subjects were displaced from a vertical position and had to detect the direction of body tilts. Results showed that the threshold for the perception of body tilt was higher when subjects were immobilized in the body cast and when they were tilted backward. Experiment 3 replicated the same protocol from a supine starting position. Compared to results of Experiment 2, the threshold for the perception of body tilt decreased significantly. Overall, these data suggested that gravity-based <b>somesthetic</b> cues are more informative than otolithic cues for the perception of a quasi-static body orientation...|$|E

The projections of the posterolateral and posteromedial ventral nuclei (VPL, VPM) to the second <b>somesthetic</b> area (SⅡ) are organized somatotopically. The posterior portion of SⅡ (hindlimb area) receives fibers largely from the dorsolateral part of VPL, the middle portion of SⅡ (forelimb area) from the ventromedial part of VPL, and the anterior portion of SⅡ(face area) from VPM. These topical projections are more loosely organized and less densely arranged than those to the first <b>somesthetic</b> area (SI). The SⅡ receives a few fibers from the medial geniculate nucleus, particularly its magnocellular and dorsal principal parts, and from the suprageniculate nucleus.

Impairments were more apparent for smaller (3 degrees) than for larger (15 degrees) movements. Previous studies that have failed to show major motor impairments in deafferented subjects examined movements involving rather large joint displacements, and this may have been a factor in the failure of these studies to reveal severe deficits.

40|$|The dorsal column nuclei, cuneatus and gracilis, play a {{fundamental}} {{role in the}} processing and integration of <b>somesthetic</b> ascending information. Intracellular and patch-clamp recordings obtained in cat in vivo have shown that cuneothalamic projection neurons present two modes of activity: oscillatory and tonic (Canedo et al 1998 Neuroscience 84 603 – 17). The former is the basis of generating, in sleep and anaesthetized states, slow, delta and spindle rhythms {{under the control of the}} cerebral cortex (Mariño et al 2000 Neuroscience 95 657 – 73). The latter is needed, during wakefulness, to process <b>somesthetic</b> information in real time. To study this behaviour we have developed the first realistic computational model of the cuneothalamic projection neurons. The modelling was guided by experimental recordings, which suggest the existence of hyperpolarization-activated inward currents, transient low- and high-threshold calcium currents, and calcium-activated potassium currents. The neuronal responses were simulated during (1) sleep, (2) transition from sleep to wakefulness and (3) wakefulness under both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input.

There were no starting or ending reference points or preparatory signals. Monkeys were trained to perform movements larger than 15 degrees within 500 ms of the stimulus presentation. After electrolytic lesion of the dentate nucleus ipsilateral to the trained arm, changes in reaction time (RT) were observed. Mean daily RTs of movements triggered by light and sound were lengthened by 50 - 70 ms. RTs of movements triggered by <b>somesthetic</b> stimuli were not changed in one monkey, whereas a small increase of only 20 ms was observed in the other animal. Spontaneous firing of precentral neurons {{was about the same}} before and after dentate lesion. However, movement-related responses of cortical neurons were affected by the lesion. Whenever there was an increase in RT according to the triggering stimuli, a corresponding increase in the response time of neurons (RS) appeared. Both RS and RT increased by the same amount when movements were triggered by visual and auditory stimuli, whereas they remained about the same when <b>somesthetic</b> stimuli were used to trigger movements. In contrast, the time interval between the appearance of the change of neuronal firing and onset of arm displacement (RM) was not modified after the lesion. Gating of sensory conditioning inputs and modification of RT by the presentation of more than one stimulus were not abolished by dentate lesion. As a whole, the effects of dentate lesion on motor cortical neurons are consistent with the hypothesis that the neocerebellum controls the initiation of simple ballistic limb movements by controlling the discharge of motor cortex neurons. The effects could be attributed to the withdrawal of a facilitatory influence of dentate neurons on the motor cortical cells, particularly for movements triggered by teleceptive inputs...|$|E

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients from each group (BMS, ITN, PHN) and 60 healthy controls were evaluated with a systematized quantitative approach of thermal (cold and warm), mechanical, pain, gustation, olfaction and salivary flow; data were analyzed with ANOVA, Tukey, Kruskal Wallis and Dunn tests {{with a level of}} significance of 5 %. RESULTS: There were no salivary differences among the groups with matched ages; the cold perception was abnormal only at the mandibular branch of PHN (P = 0. 001) and warm was abnormal in all trigeminal branches of PHN and BMS; mechanical sensitivity was altered at the mandibular branch of PHN and in all trigeminal branches of BMS. The salty, sweet and olfactory thresholds were higher in all studied groups; the sour threshold was lower and there were no differences of bitter.

Most observers report that visual subjective vertical is tilted in the direction opposite to the head/body tilt. The results can be interpreted by employing a model developed by Mittelstaedt (1983), which suggests that visual subjective vertical is derived from a gravity vector transduced by vestibular and <b>somesthetic</b> receptors combined with 'idiotropic vectors' that represent {{the orientation of the}} observer's own head and body axes...|$|E
40|$|Without {{relevant}} visual cues, {{the subjective}} visual vertical (SVV) is biased in roll-tilted subjects toward the body axis (Aubert or A-effect). This {{study focused on}} the role of the somatosensory system with respect to the SVV and on whether <b>somesthetic</b> cues act through the estimated body tilt. The body cast technology was used to obtain a diffuse tactile stimulation. An increased A-effect was expected because of a greater underestimation of the body position in the body cast. Sixteen subjects placed in a tilt chair were rolled sideways from 0 degrees to 105 degrees. They were asked to verbally indicate their subjective body position and then to adjust a luminous line to the vertical under strapped and body cast conditions. Results showed a greater A-effect (p <. 001) but an overestimation of the body orientation (p <. 01) in the body cast condition for the higher tilt values (beyond 60 degrees). Since the otolith organs produced the same gravity response in both conditions, errors were due to a change in <b>somesthetic</b> cues. Visual and postural errors were not directly related (no correlation). However, the angular distance between the apparent body position and the SW remained stable, suggesting that the change in somatosensory pattern inputs has a similar impact on the cognitive processes involved in assessing the perception of external space and the sense of self-position...|$|E

The illusion is most often experienced as a <b>somesthetic</b> phantom, but rarer SPLs may be intentionally triggered or seen. Here, we report {{the case of a}} left visual, tactile, and intentional SPL caused by right subcortical damage in a nondeluded woman. Methods: Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the multimodal nature of this phantom, which the patient claimed to be able see, use, and move intentionally. The patient participated in a series of sensorimotor and motor imagery tasks involving the right, the left plegic, and the SPL’s hand. Results: Right premotor and motor regions were engaged when she imagined that she was scratching her left cheek with her left plegic hand, whereas when she performed the same task with the SPL, additional left middle occipital areas were recruited. Moreover, comparison of responses induced by left cheek (subjectively feasible) versus right cheek scratching (reportedly unfea-sible movement) with the SPL demonstrated significant activation in right <b>somesthetic</b> areas. Interpretation: These findings demonstrate that intentional movements of a seen and felt SPL activate premotor and motor areas together with visual and sensory cortex, confirming its multimodal dimension and the reliability of the patient’s verbal reports.

40|$|Travelling {{on board}} of {{locomotion}} vehicles often induce sensorial stimulations which provoke perceptive illusions. These erroneous perceptions of body position were {{defined in the}} literature as spatial disorientation, which is principally considered as otolithic origin. In fact, during a forward sustained linear acceleration, the resultant of the imposed acceleration and gravity is no longer aligned with the gravitational vertical. As other physical accelerometer, the otolithic system cannot discriminate the acceleration of gravity from sustained inertial acceleration, and will perceive this resultant, defined as gravito-inertial acceleration (GiA), as the new vertical. Elevator and oculogravic illusions are listed among the most experienced behavioural effects. These illusions are defined as erroneous visual perception of object position in hypergravity environment. This thesis takes an interest in i) sensorial information cues involved in perceptive illusions in hypergravity, ii) interindividuals differences in the estimation of visual horizon, iii) the role of egocentric and exocentric references implicated in elevator and oculogravic illusions.

All the balance subsystems [1] are involved, with a reduction in: Vestibular receptor cells (20 % to 40 %) [2] Visual acuity, field and depth, contrast sensitivity Myelinated and unmyelinated fibers (axonal atrophy with decline in conduction velocity and sensor...|$|E
40|$|Neurons with somatic sensory {{receptive}} {{fields were}} examined electrophysiologically in the thalamic reticular {{nucleus of the}} cat. All cells had receptive fields much larger than those of neurons in the ventral posterior nucleus and were driven by less readily defined <b>somesthetic</b> stimuli. Response latencies to peripheral or medial lemniscal stimulation were, on average, longer than in the ventral posterior nucleus and suggested activation of the reticular nucleus cells by collaterals of thalamocortical relay cell axons arising in the ventral posterior nucleus. When injected intracellularly with horseradish peroxidase, reticular nucleus cells displayed thin axons with intrareticular collaterals and diffuse branches {{through much of the}} ventral posterior and posterior thalamic nuclei. Dendrites ended i...|$|E
