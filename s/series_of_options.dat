2500|$|ROV {{is usually}} used when {{the value of}} a project is {{contingent}} on the value of some other asset or underlying variable. (For example, the viability of a mining project is contingent on the price of gold; if the price is too low, management will abandon the mining rights, if sufficiently high, management will develop the ore body. Again, a DCF valuation would capture only one of these outcomes.) Here: (1) using financial option theory as a framework, the decision to be taken is identified as corresponding to either a call option or a put option; (2) an appropriate valuation technique is then employed – usually a variant on the Binomial options model or a bespoke simulation model, while Black Scholes type formulae are used less often; see Contingent claim valuation. (3) The [...] "true" [...] value of the project is then the NPV of the [...] "most likely" [...] scenario plus the option value. (Real options in corporate finance were first discussed by Stewart Myers in 1977; viewing corporate strategy as a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>options</b> was originally per Timothy Luehrman, in the late 1990s.)

5000|$|Recently, real options {{have been}} {{employed}} in business strategy, both for valuation purposes {{and as a}} conceptual framework. The idea of treating strategic investments as options was popularized by Timothy Luehrman [...] in two HBR articles: [...] "In financial terms, a business strategy is much more like a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>options,</b> than a series of static cash flows".

Our model assumes a small risk of a rare disaster that is calibrated based on the international data on large consumption declines. We allow the risk of this rare disaster to be stochastic, which turns out to be crucial to the model’s ability to explain both equity volatility and option prices.

50|$|For example, in the West, {{applicants}} {{prefer to}} eliminate details {{and focus on}} the larger issue, tending towards a comprehensive evaluation starting from individual elements then moving towards the whole.

Likewise, there are differences between individualist and collectivist cultures in the types of answers they chose. When given a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>options,</b> individualists tend to choose the task oriented option that involves direct communication with others.

The price of volatility risk is estimated from option prices simultaneously for stocks and the index. We find that the volatility risk premia is not constant over time and that it differs across stocks. However, our model yields very small option pricing errors both in-sample and out-of-sample. Our future work will focus on (1) improving the estimation from the joint data <b>of</b> returns and <b>option</b> prices, and test the statistical significance of model parameters, (2) compare our modeling approach with existing univariate models from a trading perspective, and (3) extend our model with a latent process to describe the price of volatility risk...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{gives an}} arbitrage-free {{prediction}} for future prices of an arbitrary co-terminal set <b>of</b> <b>options</b> with a given maturity, {{based on the}} observed time <b>series</b> <b>of</b> these <b>option</b> prices. The statistical analysis of such a multi-dimensional time <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>option</b> prices corresponding to n strikes (with n large, e. g. n≥ 40) and the same maturity, is a difficult task {{due to the fact}} that option prices at any moment in time satisfy non-linear and non-explicit no-arbitrage restrictions. Hence any n-dimensional time series model also has to satisfy these implicit restrictions at each time step, a condition that is impossible to meet since the model innovations can take arbitrary values. We solve this problem for any n∈ in the context of Foreign Exchange (FX) by first encoding the option prices at each time step in terms of the parameters of the corresponding risk-neutral measure and then performing the time series analysis in the parameter space. The option price predictions are obtained from the predicted risk-neutral measure by effectively integrating it against the corresponding option payoffs. The non-linear transformation between option prices and the risk-neutral parameters applied here is not arbitrary: it is the standard mapping used by market makers in the FX option markets (the SABR parameterisation) and is given explicitly in closed form. Our method is not restricted to the FX asset class nor does it depend on the type of parameterisation used. Statistical analysis of FX market data illustrates that our arbitrage-free predictions outperform the naive random walk forecasts, suggesting a potential for building management strategies for portfolios of derivative products, akin to the ones widely used in the underlying equity and futures markets.
