40|$|ABSTRACT A <b>spontaneous</b> <b>infertility</b> {{condition}} in hens {{taken from a}} commercial turkey flock was studied. Forty-eight hens from the original flock of about 2200 were housed in cages to obtain individual fertility records. Thirteen of the 48 hens were sterile upon arrival from the parent flock while five laid eggs which were all fertile. The fertility of other individuals fell between these extremes. Even hens with fertility as low as 9 % laid a scattering of fertile eggs after insemination, showing they did store sperm. Reinsemination of the hens with good quality semen did not amelio-rate the condition. Insemination in a manner designed to bypass the normal sperm storage glands (i. e. intramagnal AI) increased fertility from less than 10 % to over 85 %. Hens inseminated in this manner had an average fertility level of 70. 6 % in the second week after AI and 23. 1 % in the third. Low fertility hens which underwent a period of sexual rest and ovarian and oviducal regression had high levels of fertility when egg laying resumed. In the 7 th and 8 th weeks after resumption of lay it appeared that fertility was again declining...|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between time from planned to achieved pregnancy and pregnancy outcome {{has been studied}} {{in a group of}} 18, 658 workers in the textile, clothing and foot-wear industries. Information on pregnancy outcome and delay in conception in the period 1979 - 84 was collected by self administered questionnaires in 1985. The response rate was 70. 3 %. During the study period there had been 5, 171 live births and 708 spontaneous abortions. Information on delay in conception was collected in broad categories. The data were analysed by means of a newly developed statisti-cal parametric model in order to collect all possible in-formation from the highly grouped data.

40|$|Experimental and {{clinical}} data {{reported in the}} literature emphasize the important role that immune factors may play in the genesis of male infertility even if many problems still remain to be solved. Auto or homo-sensitization in animals (and in male volunteers) can be obtained with testicular homogenate or epididymal spermatozoa and complete Freund's adjuvant. Immune orchitis in spontaneous human pathology has also been reported. Vasectomy for the voluntary control of male fertility may be considered a particular form of experimental autoimmunization; and many vasectomized individuals develop antisperm antibodies in blood serum and/or in seminal plasma. In <b>spontaneous</b> male <b>infertility</b> antisperm antibodies can: (i) be a mere epiphenomenon; (ii) be a factor aggravating a pathologic situation already able to cause infertility; (iii) play a pathogenetic role in some forms of so-called idiopathic infertility and so could be defined as infertility due to antisperm antibodies. If the antisperm autoimmune reaction represents the casual factor of infertility, corticosteroid therapy seems to give the most satisfactory results, administered either in high doses for a very short time period or in low doses over a prolonged period, or even after transient pharmacologically induced azoospermia...|$|R

40|$|Chromosomal {{abnormality}} is {{a leading}} cause of aging-related <b>infertility,</b> <b>spontaneous</b> abortion and congenital birth defects in humans. Karyotype analyses of spontaneously aborted human fetuses reveal high proportions (~ 50 %) being chromosomal abnormal with the majority being trisomies of various chromosomes. As a model organism, mice are widely used for studies of reproduction and reproductive aging. Like older women, older mice exhibit high incidences of early embryo death. However, it is not known if aneuploidy is prevalent amongst resorptions in older mice. We have karyotyped 65 retarded/resorbed fetuses in 10 -month-old C 57 BL/ 6 mice, and found that 55 (84. 6 %± 8. 8 %, with 95 % confidence) were euploid. Similarly, of 40 such fetuses from 17 month-old C 57 BL/ 6 mice, we found 38 (95 ± 7 %, with 95 % confidence 95 %) being euploid.

We carried out meiotic studies in an infertile male to detect meiotic non-disjunction mechanisms leading to aneuploidy in spermatogenesis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Meiotic studies were performed in testicular and semen samples from a 38 -year-old teratozoospermic male with normal somatic karyotype {{and a history}} of spontaneous abortions. We analysed 262 spermatocytes (69 pachytene cells, 106 metaphases I (MI), 87 metaphases II (MII)) by multiplex-fluorescence in situ hybridization and 20 193 spermatozoa by multicolour-FISH with probes for chromosomes 9, 10, 15, 21, X and Y. The results indicate high increase of 21 and XY disomies, as well as diploidy in both spermatocytes at MII and spermatozoa (P < 0. 0001). Achiasmate segregation of sex chromo-somes was found in 3. 4 % of spermatocytes II, preceded by early-dissociated XY bivalent at MI (41. 5 % of cells). We also detected premature separation of sister chromatids (PSSC) in 4. 6 % of MII. CONCLUSION: This individual presents high levels of numerical abnormalities in germ cells, caused by two different nondisjunction mechanisms during meiosis I.

The scope {{of this investigation was}} to screen a selected group of children with idiopathic mental retardation for subtelomeric anomalies using the multiprobe telomeric FISH method and also to develop and test a new assay, the MAPH telomeric assay, in the same group of patients. The new MAPH telomeric assay uses the recently published MAPH methodology that permits the measurement of locus copy number by hybridisation with a specifically designed set of probes located at the end of human chromosomes. Seventy patients with idiopathic mental retardation have been screened using the established multiprobe telomeric FISH assay and the new MAPH telomeric assay, for all telomeres. One patient with de novo 8 p subtelomeric deletion was identified. The new MAPH telomeric assay confirmed the same results in both normal and abnormal samples. This is the first description of the use of MAPH methodology to detect chromosomal imbalances near the telomeres in idiopathic mentally retarded patients. The new MAPH telomeric assay offers a new, fast, accurate and cost effective diagnostic tool to detect chromosomal imbalances near telomeres in mentally retarded patients, as well as the characterisation of known {{chromosomal abnormalities}}, <b>spontaneous</b> recurrent miscarriages, <b>infertility,</b> hematological malignancies, preimplantation genetic diagnosis, and other fields of clinical and research interests...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Natural killer (NK) {{cells are}} the {{predominant}} lymphocyte {{population in the}} decidua. Being the most abundant leucocytes, the activity of NK cells is important in different immuno-pathological conditions, such as recurrent <b>spontaneous</b> abortions, <b>infertility</b> and problems in implantation. The NK cells recognize HLA class I molecules on trophoblasts trough killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) found on their surface. The KIRs are classified as either activating or inhibitory, regarding the effect they produce on NK cells upon interaction with corresponding ligand. Since KIR genes exhibit extensive polymorphism and individuals differ in both the number and kind (activating vs. inhibitory) of KIR genes, it is hypothesized that the KIR gene content might influence the pregnancy outcome. Aim: The aim of this pilot study is to analyze the frequency of different KIR genes in women with infertility problems, and compare them to healthy women. Material and Methods: Total of 122 healthy women (Control) and 25 women with reproductive problems (MISSC) participated in this study. After signing of written consent DNA was isolated from peripheral blood using phenol/chloroform method. The genotyping of 16 KIR genes was performed using commercially available kit from Dynal Biotech, (Pel-Freez Clinical Systems, Brown Deer, WI, USA), based on SSP method. Results: We found that inhibitory KIR are present in similar observed frequency in both control and patients with MISSC, except KIR 2 DL 5 which was found in lower frequency in patients with MISSC. There are no significant differences of all noninhibitory KIR between control and patients with MISSC. The number of inhibitory KIR genes in patients with MISSC was lover, except for seven inhibitory KIR genes which was almost doubled. The number of noninhibiotry (stimulatory) KIR genes was lower in patients with MISSC, except for those with three KIR genes which were almost four times more frequent. We found significantly bigger percentage of 0, 34 – 0, 60 activating/inhibitory KIR gene number ratio in the patients with MISSC. Conclusion: In conclusion, {{there are differences in}} the KIR gene distribution, gene number, and activating/inhibitory KIR gene number ratio between control and Macedonian patients with MISSC. Further analysis of frequencies of corresponding KIR genotypes or in the ratio of activating/inhibiting genes content in two groups are needed. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTranslocation {{is one of}} {{the more}} common {{structural}} rearrangements of chromosomes, with a prevalence of 0. 2 %. The two most common types of chromosomal translocations, Robertsonian and reciprocal, usually result in no obvious phenotypic abnormalities when balanced. However, these are still associated with reproductive risks, such as <b>infertility,</b> <b>spontaneous</b> abortion and the delivery of babies with mental retardation or developmental delay. In recent years, array-based whole-genome amplification (WGA) technologies, including microarray comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH; aCGH) and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) micro-arrays, have enabled the screening of every chromosome for whole-chromosome aneuploidy and segmental imbalance. These techniques have been shown to have clinical application for translocation carriers. Promising studies have indicated that array-based PGD of translocation carriers can lead to transfer pregnancy rates of 45 – 70 % [2]. In addition to genetic testing techniques, the embryo biopsy stage (polar body, cleavage embryo or blastocyst) and the mode of embryo transfer (fresh or frozen embryos) can affect the outcome of PGD. It is now generally recommended that blastomere biopsy should be replaced by blastocyst biopsy to avoid a high mosaic rate and biopsy-related damage to cleavage-stage embryos, which might affect embryo development. However, more clinical data are required to confirm that the technique of SNP array-based PGD (SNP-PGD) combined with trophectoderm (TE) biopsy and frozen embryo transfer (FET) is superior to traditional FISH-PGD combined with Day 3 (D 3) blastomere biopsy and fresh embryo transfer...|$|R
40|$|Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) {{represents}} a common endocrinopathy, with anovulation and hyperandrogenism as cardinal symptoms. In recent {{years it has}} been recognized that insulin resistance is an intrinsec feature of the disorder and plays {{a central role in}} pathogenesis. PCOS is associated with important reproductive morbidity as shown by high prevalence of anovulatory <b>infertility,</b> <b>spontaneous</b> abortion, gestational diabetes and preeclampsia. The association of insulin resistance with this reproductive pathology has been well documented. Due to major implication of insulin resistance in PCOS pathogenesis, insulin reduction strategies were studied as a possible treatment for infertility in PCOS patients. Weight loss, even modest was proved to be a simple and efficient method to improve reproductive parameters in PCOS patients and should be recommended to all overweight and obese patients with infertility. Metformin was showed to induce ovulation, at least in a subset of patients with PCOS, but there are not unequivocal proves concerning its efficacy for pregnancies and live-birth rate, mainly because few trials studied this aspect. Therefore there are not enough evidences to recommend metformin for infertility treatment in PCOS. Few small studies with newer thiazolidindiones suggest their efficacy for ovulation induction, but further extensive studies are needed to confirm these results. In conclusion, reduction of insulin resistance was proved to ameliorate ovulation rate in PCOS patients, but strong evidences to sustain the utility of insulin-sensitizing drugs as a therapeutic option for infertility are lacking. Future studies are needed to elucidate these aspects and to characterize the particular subtype of patients with higher probability to respond to this treatment...|$|R

30|$|When a {{farm animal}} is {{killed by a}} predator, the Swedish {{authorities}} provide a set sum of compensation {{for the value of}} the animal. However, the greatest costs caused by predators to farms practising forest pasturing are not animals killed, but changes in animal behaviour, which farmers claim as threat to the basis of their farming practices. These include animals not returning home at night, decreasing milk production and occasionally, although more frequently in sheep than cows, <b>spontaneous</b> abortion or <b>infertility</b> during the following insemination season. All these effects are said {{to be the result of}} stress but are inherently difficult to account for. In most cases, farmers notice that predators have come close to their cattle when they find their herd has scattered. This is usually not noticed until it is time for the cattle to come home to their stalls in the evening and they fail to do so. Cattle can also hurt themselves as they flee from predators, even when they are fenced in, as they run straight through the fence. After being collected and put back in their stalls they can become unmanageable or prove to be less trustworthy during daily routines such as milking or being sent out to graze in the forest. In one such case when cows showed increasing aggression after having been in contact with bears, a local official recommended that the cows be put down, as they had become afraid of predators. The farmer was also recommended to place bear skins in the stall to get the animals used to their smell, supposedly making them less afraid. The farmer told me that he did not agree with this advice, as he thought that, if anything, cows with an instinct to flee predators would have a better chance of surviving predator attacks, but complied anyway as he was worried that not complying would damage his relationship with the authorities.|$|R
40|$|Deoxyribonucletides (dNTPs) are {{synthesized}} via the de novo and salvage pathways. The {{de novo synthesis}} involves initial {{synthesis of}} ribonucleotides whereas the salvage pathway uses deoxyribonucleosides. Deoxynucleoside kinases (dNKs) initiate the salvage pathway and this step is often considered as rate limiting. The two pathways eventually coincide to one where nucleoside monophosphate kinases are the shared enzymes. In this thesis two thymidine kinases (TKs) and a thymidylate kinase (TMPK) are cloned, expressed and characterized and they originate from Ureaplasma urealyticum (Uu) and Bacillus anthracis (Ba). Uu causes urethritis and is associated with complications in pregnancy, e. g. premature births, <b>infertility,</b> <b>spontaneous</b> abortions and chronic lung disease in the infants. Ba causes anthrax; cutaneous, inhalational and gastrointestinal, where the two latter have a high mortality rate. Ba is also considered as a potent bioweapon because of its spore forming ability. TK from Uu (Uu-TK) was strictly pyrimidine specific and used all nucleoside triphosphates as phosphate donors, except dTTP that was a feedback inhibitor. Further studies discovered that analogs with halogen substitutions at the 5 -position gave the highest activity. Analogs with modifications at the N 3 - or 3 ’-position showed good to moderate activities while 2 ’-substituents were not substrates. A fluorine substitution was tolerated in the 2 ’-arabinosyl position. These results correlated well with the active site structure of Uu-TK. The Uu-TK structure contained a unique domain, the lasso domain with a structural zinc ion, and belonged structurally to another enzyme family than the other dNKs. TK and TMPK from Ba (Ba-TK and Ba-TMPK) were strictly pyrimidine and thymidylate specific, respectively. Ba-TK used all nucleoside triphosphates as phosphate donors, except dTTP, and phosphorylated several nucleoside analogs. The analog activities of Ba-TK were {{similar to that of}} Uu-TK. Ba-TMPK used ATP and dATP as phosphate donors and a number of analogs as substrates. FMAUMP (1 -(2 -deoxy- 2 -fluoro-D-arabinofuranosyl) - 5 -methyluracil- 5 ’-monophosphate) was the best substrate and its nucleoside form was a potent inhibitor. Enzymes in thymidylate synthesis are potential targets for antibacterial therapy and the studies conducted in this thesis have discovered several potential leads, which will contribute to future design of antibiotics...|$|R
40|$|Background: Sexually {{transmitted}} infections (STIs) {{remain a}} challenge mainly in developing countries, {{and in particular}} in sub-Saharan Africa, which also faces a serious HIV epidemic. Sexually Transmitted Infections can lead to serious complications such as <b>infertility,</b> <b>spontaneous</b> abortions, still births, cervical cancer and also enhance transmission of HIV. Control of STIs is thus important. Many STIs are curable, and prompt care seeking shortens the duration of an STI and prevents complications in the source patient as well as secondary spread of the infection. The World Health Organization recommends the use of syndromic guidelines {{for the management of}} STIs in countries with limited diagnostic facilities. A search of the literature showed gaps in current information on STIs in Zambia. This thesis focused on the causes of genital ulcer disease (GUD), its predictors, healthcare seeking and sexual behaviour among individuals with genital ulceration, and further examined syphilis trends in pregnant women compared with changes in the general population. Methods: The thesis utilised data from the Antenatal Clinic (ANC) sentinel surveillance system, the Zambia Demographic and Health Surveys (ZDHS) and a cross sectional survey of 200 patients with GUD in Lusaka district. Both the ANC and ZDHS data comprised information from interviews as well as syphilis and HIV test results. In the GUD study, swabs from the genital ulcers were tested for Treponema pallidum, Herpes Simplex types 1 and 2, Haemophilus ducreyi, and Chlamydia trachomatis using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: The ANC surveys showed an overall significant decline in syphilis trends between 1994 and 2008 among urban and rural women. The decline was sharp irrespective of educational level, however, there were striking provincial variations noted. A comparison with the ZDHS 2001 / 2 and 2007 data also showed an overall reduction (though not significant), in syphilis prevalence among urban and rural {{men and women in the}} general population. The pathogens detected by PCR from the 200 patients with GUD in Lusaka were as follows: Herpes Simplex Virus type 2 (HSV- 2) was detected in 28 % of ulcers, Treponema pallidum in 11 %; Chlamydia trachomatis in 3 %; Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 in 0. 5 %, and Haemophilus ducreyi was not detected at all. Fifty five percent of the patients did not have any pathogens detected from their ulcers. The 2007 ZDHS showed a low prevalence of self-reported genital ulcers (GU) in the general population (3 %). Important predictors for GU were age (25 - 39 years), being widowed/separated/divorced and having had a high number of lifetime sexual partners. No differences in care-seeking for GU were observed by age and gender, and more than half the respondents sought care from public health facilities. Among patients that presented with GUD in Lusaka, 57 % reported sex after onset of symptoms and only 15 % of these reported consistent condom use. Conclusion: Syphilis declined by about 60 % or more in rural and urban pregnant women between 1994 and 2008. The variations however that were noted at provincial level need to be studied further to understand the local context of the epidemics, and to guide STI prevention and control programmes in the different geographical settings. Detection of pathogens using PCR showed that HSV- 2 was the commonest cause of GUD among patients with genital ulceration in primary health care clinics in Lusaka. The fact that Haemophilus ducreyi was not detected in any of the patients requires further studies. If the findings are validated, treatment guidelines for GUD need to be revised in Zambia. Since the majority of the respondents who reported symptoms of GU also reported having sex and only a minority had used a condom, there is need for awareness campaigns on the importance of abstinence or use of condoms when experiencing symptoms of GUs. </p...|$|R
