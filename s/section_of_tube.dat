5000|$|Fixed {{occlusion}} - In {{this kind}} of pump, the rollers have a fixed locus as it turns, keeping the occlusion constant as it squeezes the tube. This is a simple, yet effective design. The only downside to this design is that the occlusion as a percent on the tube varies with the variation of the tube wall thickness. Typically the wall thickness of the extruded tubes vary enough that the % occlusion can vary with the wall thickness (see above). Therefore, a <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>tube</b> with greater wall thickness, but within the accepted tolerance, will have higher percent occlusion, which increases the wear on the tubing, thereby decreasing the tube life. Tube wall thickness tolerances today are generally kept tight enough that this issue is not of much practical concern. For those mechanically inclined, {{this may be the}} constant strain operation.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{problems}} with the chain model of a siphon, and understanding these differences helps to explain the actual workings of siphons. First, unlike in the chain model of the siphon, it is not actually the weight on the taller side compared to the shorter side, that matters. Rather it is the difference in height from the reservoir surfaces {{to the top of the}} siphon, that determines the balance of pressure. For example, if the tube from the upper reservoir to the top of the siphon has a much larger diameter than the taller <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>tube</b> from the lower reservoir to the top of the siphon, the shorter upper section of the siphon may have a much larger weight of liquid in it, and yet the lighter volume of liquid in the down tube can pull liquid up the fatter up tube, and the siphon can function normally.|$|E

The strength of fillet welded connections is investigated for different leg lengths. The ultimate strength of weld metal is determined by considering the forces acting on the welds. The effect of different leg lengths on the strength of welds is investigated by numerical methods and compared with analytical calculations which show that they are in agreement. The increasing in weld leg length is caused of increasing in weld strength and decreasing in stress progress in weld that cause the increasing in life and strength of the weld which is also in agreement with Iman Hadipour [4]...|$|E

40|$|Fluid {{flows through}} elastic-walled tubes {{are common in}} {{biological}} and industrial systems, and have received much attention through experimental, numerical and analytical studies. Experiments show that steady flow along an elastic-walled tube can become unstable to large-amplitude oscillations involving both the tube wall and the fluid. To study these oscillations theoretically, we need to model the fluid mechanics of the interior fluid and the solid mechanics of the elastic wall. In previous work by the author, the latter has been accomplished using a rationally-derived `tube law' valid for long-wavelength small amplitude deformations. The tube law links the pressure difference P across the wall to the change α in cross-sectional area of the tube at each axial position z. Axial tension effects are included by a term involving ∂^ 2 α/∂ z^ 2. However, this second-order tube law does not process enough axial derivatives to satisfy the full set of boundary conditions where an elastic <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>tube</b> is clamped to a rigid section. Boundary layers are needed, in which some of the neglected axial derivatives are reintroduced. Asymptotic analysis reveals a rich variety of different bending and shearing tube-end boundary layers in different regimes, some of which can have significant effects on the interior solutions...|$|E

Currently, corrosion phenomena are particularly observed on superheater’s tubes. Corrosion rates depend mainly on installation design, operating conditions i. e. gas and steam temperature and velocity of the flue gas containing ashes. This paper presents the results obtained using an innovative laboratory-scale corrosion pilot, which simulates MSWI boilers conditions characterized by a temperature gradient at metal tube {{on the presence of}} corrosive gases and ashes.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{development}} of photobioreactors is very important because the bioreactor is the technical centerpiece of the production of microalgae biomass. Apart from maximum production, other factors such as geometric and hydrodynamic parameters, measured performance criteria and mode and stability of operation, and cost effectiveness of the bioreactor need to be optimized. Clear criteria are missing for an assessment such as is needed to establish a uniform basis of data for sustainability and life-cycle assessments. Although several reactors will be presented in the following paper, the primary objective is to set the framework for such an assessment of photobioreactors. This begins in design features, but also goes beyond this to a definition of performance parameters, whose measurement is required and which ultimately determine whether {{the use of a}} reactor is successful. the primary objective being to set a framework for assessing photobioreactors. 2 Direct Design Features In contrast to usual reactors, there must be a transparent surface in order to ensure the light influx reaches the contents. This results in two basic forms. Photobioreactors are divided into plate reactors and tubular reactors (fig. 1). Plate reactors are perfused with gas from the bottom to ensure the CO 2 influx. The pneumatic energy brought in by the bubbles is converted into mechanical mixing energy. Circulation of the medium in tubular reactors is maintained by hydraulic pumps that provide the necessary mechanical energy. Gassing takes place {{at the beginning and end}} of a <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>tube.</b> Starting from these basic types, important design features and parameters for process engineering will be discussed below.

40|$|Eddy current (EC) {{estimate}} of flaw size obtained from inservice inspection {{is often the}} primary means of assessing the structural integrity of steam generator tubes. Reliable prediction of failure pressure and leak rate in tubes with complex cracking requires more detailed information about the geometry and extent of degradation than is generally available from conventional bobbin coil examinations. High-resolution inspections with EC rotating probes are thus carried out on selected regions of tubing to provide the more extensive nondestructive evaluation (NDE) information {{that is needed to}} better assess flaw size and distribution. Interpretation of signals from complex cracking that are often distorted by coherent and incoherent noise can be a challenging NDE task. Studies at Argonne National Laboratory have demonstrated that computer-aided data analysis can be used for more accurate and efficient processing of the large amounts of data collected by such probes. The basic structure of a rule-based multiparameter data analysis algorithm is described in this paper. Multiple-frequency inspection data from a standard rotating pancake coil were used for the analyses. The codes were implemented as MATLAB scripts and provide, as the final outcome, profiles of flaw depth in a <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>tube.</b> Graphical user interface tools were devised to read the information needed to carry out various stages of data processing. These interactive tools allow conversion, calibration, analysis, and display of data in various formats. Representative cases of estimated flaw profiles are shown for tube specimens with laboratory-grown cracks (with and without simulated artifacts) that were used to assess sizing accuracy. The statistical analyses used to determine NDE performance are also discussed briefly. Results of investigations to date suggest that improved resolution and sizing accuracy can be obtained in a fraction of the time required for manual analysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{superelastic}} {{behavior of}} polycrystalline nano-grained NiTi {{shape memory alloy}} micro-tube under uniaxial tension and tension-torsion are reported in this paper.

Both direct surface observation and observation by using a special surface coating show that the deformation of the tube is via the nucleation and propagation of macroscopic stress-induced martensite band. It is {{also found that the}} martensite nucleates {{in the form of a}} spiral lens-shaped narrow band that inclines at about 33 ° to the plane of the cross <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>tube</b> when the stress reaches the peak of the stress-strain curve.

The subsequent deformation of the tube is realized by the growth of this cylindrical martensite band. Several other deformation features of the tube are also observed and the results are discussed and compared with the theoretical analysis in this paper. The tension-torsion test results further revealed that: (1) During uniaxial tensile loading the deformation (via stress-induced transformation) of the micro-tube is realized by the initiation and growth of the spiral martensite band with quite sharp A-M interface; (2) During loading by torsion (pure shear) the stress strain curve exhibits monotonic hardening and the stress-induced transformation is homogeneous throughout the whole tube; (3) Under tension-torsion combined loading, with increasing the shear/tension stress ratio there is a gradual change in the deformation mode from localization and propagation (in pure tension) to the homogeneous deformation (in pure shear). The surface morphology of the tube and the macroscopic A-M interface thickness evolution are recorded. The results are analyzed by Eshelby’s inclusion theory and the obtained theoretical results on the band orientation and shape agree quite well with experiments...|$|E
