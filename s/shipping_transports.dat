40|$|International <b>shipping</b> <b>transports</b> around 90 {{percent of}} global {{commerce}} and is of major {{importance for the}} global economy. Whilst {{it is the most}} efficient and environmentally friendly mode of transport, CO 2 emissions from shipping activities still account for an estimated three percent of global emissions. As a consequence, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has recently introduced mandatory measures to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from shipping, making emission cuts not only a normative, but also a legal requirement. One means of significantly reducing fuel consumption and thereby GHG emissions from shipping are wind propulsion technologies (i. e. towing kites, Flettner rotors and sails) - yet current market uptake is very low. Therefore, the aim of this research was to identify the possibilities of the IMO as the main regulatory body in international shipping to promote the uptake of wind propulsion technologies. To this end, the theoretical approach of technological innovation systems was adopted. This approach combines structural system components with so-called system functions which represent the dynamics underlying structural changes in the system. The fulfillment of these functions is considered important for the development and diffusion of innovations. First, the level of function fulfillment was evaluated, followed by the identification of structural drivers and barriers influencing function fulfillment. Third, the IMO’s governing capacities were analyzed, enabling the formulation of policy recommendations tailored to the IMO. Data was collected from newspaper articles, company websites and an expert survey (step 1), 14 semi-structured interviews (step 2), and the review of scientific articles (step 3). Across all three wind propulsion technologies, function fulfillment was found to be low or medium, at best, which inhibits further technological development and diffusion. Several structural barriers exist, including, amongst others, a lack of policies and incentive schemes promoting wind propulsion, lack of financial resources, insufficient collaboration among different actor groups and conservative and risk-averse attitudes prevalent in the maritime industry. The number and severity of the structural barriers outweigh those of the mostly emerging structural drivers. Next, it could be asserted that in order to promote technological development and diffusion, policy interventions should focus on stimulating the development and diffusion of knowledge and help mobilize resources. Yet, even though the IMO is well-suited to facilitate knowledge development and diffusion, which it could achieve by establishing a working or correspondence group on wind propulsion, it is less suited to mobilize resources. Nonetheless, it is suggested that the IMO intensifies efforts in relation to the introduction of market-based mechanisms (MBMs), as they increase the economic viability of wind propulsion and can provide funds to be used for research and development activities on low-carbon propulsion technologies. Until the introduction of MBMs, the IMO could set up a temporary fund for the same purpose, with financial contributions from international donor organizations, national governments and industry parties...|$|E

40|$|International <b>shipping</b> <b>transports</b> {{more than}} 80 percent of global trade. Traditionally bulk {{carriers}} {{have been built}} to minimize construction cost and maximize cargo-carrying capacity, neglecting hydrodynamic characteristics. By 2025, all new ships {{will be required to}} be 30 % more energy efficient than those built in 2014. When designing bulk ships, a number of restrictions have already been applied even before the naval architect has stated designing the ship, e. g. port restrictions, canals and legislative limitations. This thesis investigate how speed performance and power requirements may be improved by lifting some of the restriction on main dimensions when designing ship hulls. Lindstad et al. (2013) introduce the idea that increasing the breadth of bulk carriers while keeping the length, draft and displacement constant, and thereby reducing the block coefficient, will be an efficient way of reducing the resistance and fuel consumption of a ship. Lindstad et al. (2013) uses an empirical model based on Holtrop and Mennen (1984) and conclude that the brake power is reduced with reduced block coefficient. However, when evaluating hull dimensions outside the range the empirical data is based on, the result obtained has high uncertainty. Numerical methods using CFD has been applied in combination with CAD program to optimize hull lines. Using CFD to calculate added resistance in waves is however very computational demanding and time consuming and can hardly be applied in an optimization process. By using a simplified numerical method {{on a wide range of}} hull designs, this thesis attempts to bridge the gap between the idea of Lindstad et al. (2013) and the numerical approach used in simulation based design. Based on an adaption of a commercial bulk carrier (CBC) and MOERI KVLCC 2 there has been designed two series of ships with a deadweight of 80 000 tons. The block coefficient varies from 0, 59 to 0, 8 for the MOERI KVLCC 2 series and 0, 64 to 0, 87 for the CBC series. When designing the hull and ship lines the focus has been on optimizing the bow, the transition between the bow and parallel midship area (forward shoulder), the parallel midship body and the stern area. Initially, the two numerical calculations programs ShipX and Michlet was tested. ShipX calculates the wave resistance of conventional monohull ships using potential theory. To make ShipX more robust it satisfies the boundary condition of the surface some distance away from the hull surface. The satisfying of the boundary condition makes it less prone to catch details in different hulls. Using Geritsma & Beukelman method combined with strip-theory approximation the added resistance in waves is calculated. Michlet is an open source research code utilizing thin ship theory to calculate wave resistance. The essential assumption is that the hull is thin, that is, the breadth is small compared to all other characteristic lengths of the problem. A benchmarking with the MOERI KVLCC 2 show that results from ShipX are correlating best with experimental results. ShipX is therefore used to calculate the calm water resistance and added resistance in waves for the two design series. When comparing the brake power as a function of block coefficient calculated using empirical and numerical methods there is a clear disagreement in the results. For both of the design series the empirical calculations show a decreasing brake power with decreasing block coefficient, giving no clear optimum. For the CBC series the numerical calculations show an optimal block coefficient of 0, 73. For the MOERI KVLCC 2 series the numerical calculations show an optimal block coefficient of 0, 78. In additions, results indicate that for a given block coefficient moving the longitudinal center of buoyancy (LCB) backward reduce the wave resistance. From the results it is concluded that the optimal block coefficient for ships in the New Panamax and Capesize segment (60 00...|$|E
