Mercury emissions to the atmosphere are reported from all high temperature processes, such as utility, commercial and residential boilers, secondary iron and steel smelters, Waste-to-Energy (WTE) plants, and sewage <b>sludge</b> <b>incinerators.</b> At present, the primary sources of atmospheric emissions in HRB are utility and industrial boilers (873 kilograms of mercury/year), secondary iron and steel plants (595 kg), Waste-to-Energy plants (147 kg), and sewage <b>sludge</b> <b>incinerators</b> (90 kg). The total deposition of mercury from the atmosphere on the surface of HRB was estimated at about 1, 100 kilograms per year. The study examined in detail the decrease in mercury emissions from WTE plants. A metric was developed that expresses emissions from WTE plants as kilograms of mercury per million tons of MSW combusted. It was shown that reported annual emissions of mercury from the U. S.

40|$|According to the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) guidelines, when calculating CO 2 {{emissions}}, CO 2 {{emissions from}} biomass should {{be excluded from}} {{the total amount of}} CO 2 emissions and should be separately reported due to their “carbon neutrality”. Sewage sludge is one of the representative biomass fuels. It is mixed with fossil fuels to achieve greenhouse gas reduction or is used by itself as a fuel to replace fossil fuels. According to the results of this study, biomass fractions of both the sewage sludge and the sewage sludge incineration exhaust gases did not amount to 100 %. At present, in many countries (South Korea, Japan, and Germany), when calculating greenhouse gas emissions from sewage sludge incinerators, all CO 2 emissions from sewage sludge are judged to be biomass and only the greenhouse gas emissions that correspond to non-CO 2 gases are calculated as greenhouse gas emissions. However, since, according our results, the content of sewage sludge is not 100 % biomass, if CO 2 emissions are excluded according to the existing greenhouse gas emission calculation method, the amount of emissions may be underestimated.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a {{development of a}} numerical model and experimental validation of the hydrodynamics in industrial-scale sewage sludge bubbling fluidized bed incinerator. The numerical model and simulations are performed using commercial CFD software package ANSYS Fluent 14. 5. The complex geometry of the developed numerical model represents the actual industrial-scale bubbling fluidized bed combustor. The gassolid flow behaviour inside the bed was described using the Eulerian-Eulerian multiphase model. The momentum exchange coefficients between the gas phase and solid particles were described by the Syamlal and O’Brien drag model equations. The CFD transient simulations were run for 350 seconds at the optimum operating conditions of the used fluidized bed with bed temperature of 850 °C. The experiments were carried out using quartz sand with three different particle sizes having a diameters ranging from 0. 5 mm to 1. 5 mm and a density of 2650 kg/m³. The industrial-scale furnace was filled with bed material to a bed height of 0. 85 m. The same operating parameters have been applied for both experimental and numerical studies. The hydrodynamics of the gas-solid industrial-scale bubbling fluidized bed at operating conditions are investigated in the CFD numerical model and simulations of this three-dimensional (3 D) complex geometry. To estimate the prediction quality of the simulations based on the developed numerical model, the minimum fluidization gas velocity and pressure drop results obtained from the CFD simulations are validated with the experimental measurements.

40|$|PCDD/F {{data are}} {{presented}} from 75 samples of primary emissions sampled between 1995 – 1997 {{as part of}} the compliance monitoring survey undertaken by the UK Environment Agency. Municipal solid waste (MSW), chemical waste and clinical waste incinerators, cement kilns, sinter plants and sewage <b>sludge</b> <b>incinerators</b> were the source categories monitored and reported here. Based on this monitoring programme, the previous national UK emission estimates by Eduljee and Dyke (1) of 560 – 1100 g I-TEQ a− 1 for 1993 have been revised downwards to 220 – 660 g I-TEQ a− 1. Despite source reduction measures, MSW incinerators remain a significant source of PCDD/Fs to the atmosphere, contributing between 30 – 50 % of the ΣPCDD/F I-TEQ emission, rather than the 80 % they were estimated to contribute in 1993. 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted PCDD/F congener profile data are presented for some of the source categories and generally support the view that differences in the mixtures (‘fingerprints’) of PCDD/Fs emitted from different sources are observed. New data on the dioxin-like PCB emissions are presented for cement kilns and sinter plants. These show that TEQ-rated PCBs can make an important contribution to the I-TEQ emitted from certain combustion sources.

40|$|Two {{methods for}} {{improving}} the energy efficiency of fluidized bed <b>sludge</b> <b>incinerators</b> were evaluated. The first method used paper pulp and polymer as conditioning agents for municipal sludge instead of lime and ferric chloride. Automatic control of the incinerator was the second method evaluated for energy savings. To evaluate the use of paper pulp and polymer as conditioning agents, varying quantities of paper pulp {{were added to the}} liquid sludge to determine the optimal sludge-to-paper pulp ratio. The effect of the paper pulp and polymer-conditioned sludge on plant operations also was evaluated. When compared to sludge conditioned with lime and ferric chloride, the paper pulp and polymer-conditioned sludge had similar cake release and feed characteristics, higher BTU values for the dry sludge solids, required less auxiliary fuel for incineration, and generated less ash for disposal. The paper pulp and polymer did not have any appreciable negative effects on the operation of the wastewater treatment plant. It was estimated that processing and incinerating the sludge conditioned with paper pulp and polymer resulted in a cost savings of up to $ 91. 73 per dry ton of activated sludge solids. To evaluate the effect of automatic control, all the incinerator operating parameters including air flow rates, fuel oil feed rates, and sludge feed rates, were automatically monitored and controlled to minimize auxiliary fuel oil use and to keep the incinerator running at optimal conditions. Although effective, the estimated cost savings for automatic control of the incinerator were small...|$|R

This similarity, found at 9 UK incinerators, {{suggests that there is}} a universal characteristic PGE pattern produced by common processes of dispersal of Pt, Pd and Rh derived from automobile catalytic converters. Ninety-one sewage <b>sludge</b> and <b>incinerator</b> ash samples from the sewage treatment facilities in Sheffield, Birmingham and 7 other UK cities were analyzed for PGE. The highest concentrations are 602 ppb Pt and 710 ppb Pd with lower maximum concentrations of 65 ppb Rh, 100 ppb Ru, 33 ppb Ir and 12 ppb Os. Ash from incinerated sewage was found to have higher PGE concentrations compared to the original sludge and the PGE ratios are preserved during incineration. Rh is more mobilized and dispersed than the other PGE as it is transported from roads into the drainage system and into sewage. Pt/Pd ratios of 1. 0 in road dust and 0. 9 in sewage and incinerator ash suggest that Pd is more mobile than Pt during dispersal. PGE abundances in stored incinerator ash of varying ages appear to have been affected by the variation in use of Pt, Pd and Rh in catalytic converters due to variation in their market prices. Concentrations of Os, Ir and Ru in ashes are greater in Sheffield and London than all the other city sites and may be derived from point industrial sources...|$|R

The {{contribution}} {{deals with}} grain size analysis and leaching test of fly ash as a solid waste from gas treatment technology at <b>sludge</b> <b>incinerator.</b> Grain size analysis and leaching test {{was carried out}} to determine hazardous substances which have adverse effect on environment. <b>Sludge</b> <b>incinerator</b> {{is a part of}} petrochemical complex and it’s used for ecological disposal of mechanical and biological sludge from the wastewater treatment plant (Géci 2013). Incineration technology of thermal oxidation is divided in two steps. In first step mixed sludge is warmed, dried and organic matter is burned off. In second step flue gas emissions are cleaned in four-step cleaning technology to keep up air emission quality. Product of the treated gas, during combustion process, is fly ash where annually production is approximately 600 t per year (Polc et al. 2013) and depends on chemical composition of burned sludge, working time per year and air emission quality. Fly ash is a mixture of inorganic compounds, salts of acidic flue gas components dissolved in water (fluorides, sulphates) and insoluble components (zeolite and activated carbon). It is a fine powder of light brown to light grey color. It contains unreacted NaHCO 3, Na 2 SO 3, Na 2 SO 4, NaCl, NaF (Špak et al. 2012, Polc et al. 2013), further small content of silicon, calcium, magnesium, iron, sodium and potassium oxides and traces of heavy metals adsorbed on the zeolite and activated carbon. The samples used for mineralogical composition were then studied at diffractometer Philips PW 1710. X-ray diffraction sample record has a relatively high background, indicating the presence of amorphous phase (23. 1 wt. %), which seems to be the amorphous glass or unburnt organic material. Mineral phase gehlenite (46. 9 wt. %) has the highest proportion in the sample, followed by maghemite (12. 7 wt. %), hematite (6 wt. %) and thenardite (6 wt. %). In granulometry analysis has been shown that fly ash is very fine material, were 97 % mass fraction is under 0. 09 mm grain size. Overall results are that 2 % of mass fraction is under 0. 04 mm gran size, 79 wt. % under 0. 063 mm, 97. 0 wt. % under 0. 09 mm, 99 wt. % under 0. 125 mm and 100 wt. % under 0. 25 mm grain size. In leaching test, there was in execution potential of hazardous compounds discharge to environment. Leaching test was executed in water solution according Annex 22 and 23 of the Decree No. 310 / 2013, which implements certain provisions of the Waste Act and this method is suitable mainly for inorganic parts of waste. Leaching of trace elements from ash is affected by the chemical composition of the solution during weathering distribution of these elements in the solid matrices and secondary phases. Secondary phases produced during weathering, have a significant control to their mobility in ash (Eary et al. 1990). Given that the flue gas cleaning technology aims to reduce emissions of acidic compounds into the atmosphere. Therefore there is the “enrichment” of these components in the waste, which leads to concentration of f luorides, sulphates, and other components in leachate. Potentially toxic elements shows decreasing leaching tendency from Al > V > Pb > Mo > As > Sn > Zn. According to high proportion of acidic components and fine fraction, leaching is also an important parameter in terms of determine the way of next handling (landfilling) of fly ash. The stabilization of waste is particularly important because of the potential leaching of acidifying components – fluoride, sulfate and total dissolved solids into environment.

Life-cycle energy and impact assessments were conducted for the Ann Arbor Water Treatment Plant (WTP) and Ann Arbor Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) in Michigan. The framework for assessment was modified to assess the environmental burdens from Laguna WWTP in California and Ypsilanti Community Utility Authority (YCUA) WWTP in Michigan. From the comparative assessment of the three WWTPs, {{it is found that}} the life-cycle energy for the YCUA WWTP is the highest- 21 GJ/MG; out of which, 46 % is from electricity used for operation, 44 % from natural gas used for the <b>sludge</b> <b>incinerator</b> and 10 % from production of chemicals used for treatment. For Ann Arbor WWTP, electricity utilized accounts for 50 %, natural gas use for 25 %, sludge-hauling for 16 % and chemicals used for 9 % of the total life-cycle energy of 16 GJ/MG. The life-cycle energy for the Laguna WWTP is the lowest - 11 GJ/MG, as it meets the total requirement for natural gas and 40 % of the electricity required from methane produced upon anaerobic sludge digestion. Hence, 91 % of the life-cycle energy for Laguna WWTP is from electricity, 8 % from chemicals and a mere 1 % from sludge-disposal. From the assessment of the Ann Arbor ‘water and wastewater’ system, it is found that the Ann Arbor ‘water and wastewater’ treatment system accounts for 54 % of the total electricity required by the Ann Arbor municipal government sector. Further, the lifecycle energy required for the system is 40 GJ/MG of clean water, out of which 60 % is from the operation of the Ann Arbor WTP. The system also generates 5, 230 kg CO 2 eq. /MG clean water or 3. 57 million kgs CO 2 eq. per year. Electricity required for operation of the Ann Arbor WTP and WWTP contributes significantly to the total life-cycle energy and emissions. Thus, energy conservation at the plants, adoption of renewable energy and an anaerobic sludge digestion system coupled with co-generation unit would prove to be useful for reducing the total life-cycle energy and environmental burdens from the system...|$|E
40|$|Platinum (Pt) and Palladium (Pd) {{concentrations}} {{have been}} analysed in 194 samples {{from within the}} city of Sheffield in the UK. The samples were taken from road dust, gully pots (also known as drains), soils, a motorway drainage pipe, rivers, lakes, sewage <b>sludge,</b> <b>incinerator</b> ash, incinerator ash in landfill, street cleansers and gully cleansers. The introduction of Pt- and Pd-bearing automobile catalysts, has been cited {{as the cause of}} a rise in the concentration of urban Pt and Pd accumulations. Geochemical analyses for the different sample types are used here to show how the Pt and Pd accumulate in different urban environments as they are transported from their catalytic source. Initially Pt and Pd collect in road dust and gully pots at values of up to 450 ppb although most analyses for both elements are around 100 ppb. The four roadside soils analysed, have a great range in values, the highest with a value of over 600 ppb Pt and 1000 ppb Pd. Then the fate of the Pt and Pd is either to be removed by gully flushers and road sweepers (which contain around half the concentration of that in road dust) or to be washed from the roads, through the gully pots, into either the river or urban drainage systems. Due to the addition of terrestrial sediments, river samples contain much reduced values of Pt and Pd, at approximately an order of magnitude lower than in road dust. Similarly, sewage sludge contains Pt and Pd values which are lower than road dust. However, the Pt and Pd analyses are much higher in incinerated sewage (with many samples over 150 ppb for both metals), probably due to the loss of the mass of other material during the incineration process. Weathered incinerator ash in landfill has lower values of Pt and Pd than fresh ash from the incinerator. Although the range in values of Pt and Pd is similar for road dust and gully pot sediments their modal values tell a different story. The mode for Pt is very similar for both road dust and gully pot sediments, at around 100 ppb, whereas there is a drop of 50 ppb in the mode for Pd in the gully pots (from 80 ppb to around 40 ppb). Given that gully pot sediment is derived from road dust, it is suggested that in gully pots, Pd is preferentially mobilized over Pt. Furthermore, a comparison of the modal values of Pt and Pd in river sediments suggests that this process continues into the natural drainage system of the city...|$|E
40|$|The {{acceptance}} and processing of fats, oils, and grease (FOG) wastes at municipal {{wastewater treatment plants}} (WWTPs) is of increasing interest {{because of the need}} to keep these materials out of wastewater collection systems, as well as the added energy recovery potential when FOG wastes are anaerobically digested. Adding FOG waste to anaerobic digesters is particularly attractive over other feedstocks such as food waste because of the high volatile content that can yield over one cubic metre of methane per kg and high degradation with minimal extra solids requiring disposal. The addition of FOG wastes to a WWTP usually requires combining the FOG waste with sludges from the WWTP, in a process that utilises the energy from FOG, such as anaerobic digestion. The manner in which this is done can impact the performance of the anaerobic digesters as well as other solids handling processes, and so must be done properly. The objective {{of this paper is to}} present a body of experience for assessing the feasibility of coprocessing FOG and other wastes with municipal sludge in anaerobic digesters. The paper also focuses on FOG waste receiving and process flow alternatives to minimise the problems that have been associated negatively with introduction of FOG wastes into a treatment plant.

Samples from vacuum bag dust from homes of 40 residents of Detroit, Los Angeles, Seattle, or Iowa who participated in a population-based case-control study of non-Hodgkin lymphoma conducted in 1998 - 2000 were analyzed using high resolution gas chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometry for 7 PCDD and 10 PCDF congeners considered toxic by the U.

Locations of 10 types of PCDD/F-emitting facilities {{were obtained from the}} EPA; however only 4 types were located near study homes (non-hazardous waste cement kilns, coal-fired power plants, sewage <b>sludge</b> <b>incinerators,</b> and medical waste incinerators). Relationships between concentrations of each PCDD/F and proximity to industrial facilities, freight routes, and major roads were evaluated using separate multivariate regression models for each congener. The median (inter-quartile range [IQR]) toxic equivalence (TEQ) concentration of these congeners in the house dust was 20. 3. pg/g (IQR. =. 14. 3, 32. 7). Homes within 3 or 5. km of a cement kiln had 2 to 9 -fold higher concentrations of 5 PCDD and 5 PCDF (p. <. 0. 1 in each model). Proximity to freight routes and major roads was associated with elevated concentrations of 1 PCDD and 8 PCDF. Higher concentrations of certain PCDD/F in homes near cement kilns, freight routes, and major roads suggest that these outdoor sources are contributing to indoor environmental exposures.

40|$|One {{target of}} any sludge {{disposal}} strategies {{is to develop}} an economy in closed loops. The usability of wastes has to be investigated. This paper is focusing on the reuse of sewage sludge ashes from mono-incinerators as raw material in the ceramic industry (brick and clay pipe manufacturing). At first, the chemical composition and the particle size distribution of sewage sludge ashes was investigated. The variations of these parameters of four sewage <b>sludge</b> <b>incinerators</b> were described within one year. Additionally {{the impact of the}} sewer system and wastewater treatment on the ash composition is presented. It was possible to simulate the mineralogical genesis of the sewage sludge ashes via firing trials. The physical impact of the ashes on the shaping, drying and firing properties and on the ceramic properties of the products became obvious. At last, the elution behaviour of the ash bricks has been described. The following results have been generated: The sewer system (combined or separated) influence the ash composition mainly. Having a combined sewer system, the collected silicate 'dilutes' the inorganic sludge components of the municipal wastewater. This can be shown by a linear dependency between the contents of SiO_ 2 and P_ 2 O 5. Furthermore, a dependency between the ignition loss of the primary sludge and the SiO_ 2 -content in the ash has been shown. It seems to be possible to predict the ash composition from operational data. The ash composition is influenced by the precipitation agents used for phosphorous elimination directly. Artificial and ash-typical minerals are generated during sludge incineration from the iron phosphates and aluminium phosphates in the sludge with participation of calcium carbonate. CO_ 2 -gas is then evaporating and makes the ash particles very porous. Therefore the calcium content of an ash is an indicator for its self-porosity. (orig.)

In this configuration, contaminants are both chemically stabilized and physically solidified, making the process a true stabilization/solidification (S/S) technology. Unlike conventional hydraulic cement grouts or thermosetting polymers, thermoplastic polymers such as polyethylene require no chemical. reaction for solidification. Thus, a stable, solid, final waste form product is assured on cooling. Variations in waste chemistry over time do not affect processing parameters and do not require reformulation of the recipe. Incorporation of waste particles within the polymer matrix serves as an aggregate and improves the mechanical strength and integrity of the waste form. The compressive strength of polyethylene microencapsulated waste forms varies based on the type and quantity of waste encapsulated, but is typically between 7 and 17. 2 MPa (1000 and 2500 psi), well above the minimum strength of 0. 4 MPa (160 psi) recommended by the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for low-level radioactive waste forms in support of 10 CFR 61 (NRC, 1991; 1983) Because polyethylene is a relatively new material, it is difficult to predict its long-term durability. However, prior to scale-up of the microencapsulation process, a study was conducted to evaluate potential degradation mechanisms. The study examined potential effects on mechanical integrity from exposure to chemicals and solvents, thermal cycling, saturated environments, microbial attack, and high gamma-radiation fields (Kalb et al., 1991). At ambient temperatures, polyethylene is relatively inert to most chemicals, including organic solvents, acids, and alkaline solutions. Exposure to changes in temperature or saturated soil conditions have been shown to degrade the mechanical integrity of some waste forms, but had little or no measurable impact on polyethylene waste forms. Low-density polyethylene is not susceptible to growth of microbial organisms, a fact that is evidenced by the lack of plastics decomposition in municipal waste landfills. When exposed to gamma-radiation at total doses of up to lo 8 rad, additional cross-linking of the polymer occurs, resulting in increased strength and lower leachability...|$|R

All 167 homes and facilities {{are connected to}} the piped water and sewer system and are fully plumbed. An ocean outfall line was recently added for seafood processing waste. The city collects refuse. The Tribe operates a recycling program which is currently on hold. A landfill, <b>incinerator,</b> <b>sludge</b> and oil disposal site have recently been completed. A new $3 million power plant came online in 2000. A small wind turbine provides power and hot water to the village office, but it is not connected to the power grid. The village corporation has three turbines. Wind turbines were due to be installed summer/fall 2007. Electricity is provided by St. Paul Municipal Electric Utility.|$|R
40|$|The Transportable Vitrification System (TVS) {{is a large}} scale, fully integrated, {{vitrification}} {{system for}} the treatment of low-level and mixed wastes in the form of <b>sludges,</b> soils, <b>incinerator</b> ash, and many other waste streams. It was demonstrated on surrogate waste at Clemson University and at the Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR) prior to treating actual mixed waste. Treatment of a combination of dried B and C Pond sludge and CNF sludge was successfully demonstrated at ORR in 1997. The demonstration produced 7, 616 kg of glass from 7, 328 kg of mixed wastes with a 60 % reduction in volume. Glass formulations for the wastes treated were developed using a combination of laboratory crucible studies with the actual wastes and small melter studies at Clemson with both surrogate and actual wastes. Initial characterization of the B and C Pond sludge had not shown the presence of carbon or fluoride, which required a modified glass formulation be developed to maintain proper glass redox and viscosity. The CNF sludge challenges the glass formulations due to high levels of phosphate and iron. The demonstration was delayed several times by permitting problems, a glass leak, and electrical problems. The demonstration showed that the two wastes could be successfully vitrified, although the design glass production rate was not achieved. The glass produced met the Universal Treatment Standards and the emissions from the TVS were well within the allowable permit limits...|$|R
40|$|This study synthesizes the {{information}} on the use of waste materials in highway construction. The information was obtained from a review of published literature supplemented by: recent unpublished reports, presentations of research updates by professionals at different forums, anti personal meetings with the experts. In addition, a questionnaire regarding the use of waste materials was prepared and distributed to each of the state highway agencies. A majority of states responded to the questionnaire, giving a summary of current practices in the use of waste materials in highway construction and their experiences on the technical, environmental, and economic aspects of the various applications of the materials. The report briefly gives the state-of-the-practice {{in the use of the}} waste materials in highway construction in the United States and discusses the applications of selected waste materials, including: waste tires, waste glass, reclaimed paving materials, slags and ashes, building rubble, sewage <b>sludge,</b> and <b>incinerator</b> residue. An evaluation based on the technical, environmental, and economic factors indicated that reclaimed paving materials, coal fly ash, blast furnace slag, bottom ash, boiler slag. Steel slag and rubber tires have significant potential to replace conventional materials for various applications in highway construction, and should be projected for future construction. Specific applications of the waste products and the potential problems associated with their usage in highway operations, which must be addressed prior to their extensive use, are included in the report...|$|R
40|$|Over 300 million {{tones of}} {{industrial}} wastes are being produced per annum by chemical and agricultural process in India. These materials pose problems of disposal and health hazards. The wastes like phosphogypsum, fluorogypsum and red mud contain obnoxious impurities which adversely affect {{the strength and}} other properties of building materials based on them. Out of several wastes being produced at present, the use of phosphogypsum, fluorogypsum, lime sludge, hypo sludge, red mud, and mine tailing is of paramount significance to protect the environment. Paper making generally produces {{a large amount of}} solid waste. Paper fibers can be recycled {{only a limited number of}} times before they become too short or weak to make high quality paper. It means that the broken, low-quality paper fibers are separated out to become waste sludge. All the inks, dyes, coatings, pigments, staples and ”stickies” (tape, plastic films, etc.) are also washed off the recycled fibers to join the waste solids. The shiny finish on glossy magazine-type paper is produced using a fine kaolin clay coating, which also becomes solid waste during recycling. This paper mill sludge consumes a large percentage of local landfill space for each and every year. Worse yet, some of the wastes are land spread on cropland as a disposal technique, raising concerns about trace contaminants building up in soil or running off into area lakes and streams. Some companies burn their <b>sludge</b> in <b>incinerators,</b> contributing to our serious air pollution problems. To reduce disposal and pollution problems emanating from these industrial wastes, it is most essential to develop profitable building materials from them. Keeping this in view, investigations were undertaken to produce low cast concrete by blending various ratios of cement with hypo sludge. This project is concerned with experimental investigation on strength of concrete and optimum percentage of the partial replacement by replacing cement via 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 %, 60 % and 70 % of Hypo Sludge...|$|R
