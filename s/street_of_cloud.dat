40|$|Different types <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> amounts have {{different}} {{influences on the}} calculation of the radiation energy of the soil-air system. Based on the occurrence of the overlaying of high, medium and low types <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> and the interaction and interrelationship of information provided by them, this paper puts forwards new concepts of "effective" frequency <b>of</b> occurrences <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> and "effective" time-average cloud amount and their calculation formulas, while the commonly used calculation formula for time-average cloud amount is treated as a special case of the calculation formula for "effective" time-average cloud amount. Through a principal component analysis of the correlation coefficient matrix formed by conditional probabilities exhibited by any other type <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> when a certain type <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> occurs, the normalized weight of the conditional probability exhibited by any other type <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> when this particular type <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> occurs is ascertained. When this particular type <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> is obscured by another type <b>of</b> <b>cloud,</b> the weight {{can be seen as}} the probability of this particular type <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> being obscured by another type <b>of</b> <b>cloud.</b> With the formula for the "effective" frequency <b>of</b> occurrences <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> and the formula for "effective" average cloud, this probability can be used to calculate the "effective" time-average <b>cloud</b> amount <b>of</b> this particular type <b>of</b> <b>cloud.</b> By applying this method to the analysis and calculation of the "effective" average cloud amount in the four different seasons as observed by 15 observation stations worldwide, this paper finds that the sum of the "effective" time-average <b>cloud</b> amounts <b>of</b> each type <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> is far closer to the observed value <b>of</b> the total <b>cloud</b> amount than the sum <b>of</b> the time-average <b>cloud</b> amounts derived by using only the calculation formula for time-average cloud amount, with more than 87 % of the relative errors <b>of</b> the total <b>cloud</b> amount corrections made by the former being smaller than 15 % and all relative errors of the total average cloud corrections made by the latter exceeding 15 %.

The analysis and experiment results show that the range of atomized factor corresponded to cloud distribution is from 3 to 18; when it is greater than 18, cloud distribution will reduce to normal distribution, and backward cloud model with uncertainty is no longer applicable.
