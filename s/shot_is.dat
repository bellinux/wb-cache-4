5|$|The {{statistics}} for team play, including team skins play, are listed below. The percentages are {{calculated for each}} player by rating their shots in each game. Each shot the player attempts is scored out of four based on how well the <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> made.|$|E
5|$|Goalkeepers {{should be}} wary of dummying, lob shots and skip or bounce shots. Dummying is where players fake shots, leading keepers {{to come out of}} the water too early. This can cause the goalkeeper to come up too early and have to go back down for energy. The lob <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> where a field player {{attempts}} to put the ball over where the goalkeeper's hands can reach. This usually happens either if the goalkeeper is out of position from the dummies or if they are too far out from the goal. The goalkeeper should swim back to try to block it, as it is nowhere near as fast as the power shot. The bounce or skip <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> where a player propels the ball at the water with enough force to make it bounce or skim along the water. It can take the goalkeeper by surprise as they cannot predict the direction the ball will go.|$|E

The direction and general rolling distance of each <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> arranged with the analog stick, and the shot's strength is set by the A button.|$|E
2500|$|The Warren Commission {{additionally}} {{concluded that}} three <b>shots</b> <b>were</b> fired {{and said that}} [...] "a substantial majority of the witnesses stated that the <b>shots</b> <b>were</b> not evenly spaced. Most witnesses recalled that {{the second and third}} <b>shots</b> <b>were</b> bunched together." ...|$|R

5|$|The {{sequence}} of events during the injection mould of a plastic part is called the injection moulding cycle. The cycle begins when the mould closes, followed by the injection of the polymer into the mould cavity. Once the cavity is filled, a holding pressure is maintained to compensate for material shrinkage. In the next step, the screw turns, feeding the next shot to the front screw. This causes the screw to retract as the next <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> prepared. Once the part is sufficiently cool, the mould opens and the part is ejected.|$|E
5|$|The severed ear that Jeffrey discovers {{is also a}} key {{symbolic}} element, leading Jeffrey into danger. Indeed, just as Jeffrey's troubles begin, {{the audience}} is treated to a nightmarish sequence in which the camera zooms into the canal of the severed, decomposing ear. Notably, the camera does not reemerge from the ear canal {{until the end of}} the film. When Jeffrey finally comes through his hellish ordeal unscathed, the ear canal <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> replayed, only in reverse, zooming out through Jeffrey's own ear as he relaxes in his yard on a summer day.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{occasional}} controversy surrounding triple-doubles made when a player achieves the feat with a late rebound. Players with nine rebounds {{in a game}} have sometimes been accused of deliberately missing a shot {{late in the game}} in order to recover the rebound; a few have even gone so far as shooting off their opponent's basket trying to score a triple-double. To deter this, NBA rules allow rebounds to be nullified if the <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> determined not to be a legitimate scoring attempt.|$|E
50|$|Round <b>shot</b> <b>were</b> undeniably inaccurate. This was because, {{despite their}} name, round <b>shot</b> <b>were</b> never {{perfectly}} spherical, {{nor did they}} fit their gun barrels exactly. Air acted on the irregular surface of the projectile. These irregularities invariably threw them off target to some degree. It is often also a matter of confusion as to why a 12pdr <b>shot</b> <b>was</b> so much more effective than a 6pdr <b>shot.</b> This <b>is</b> because {{the impact of a}} <b>shot</b> <b>was</b> not only related to its weight but also to its velocity, which, with a heavier projectile, was much greater {{at the end of the}} trajectory.|$|R

5|$|Where the <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> {{tracking}} with Superman as {{he flies}} (such {{as in the}} Superman and Lois Metropolis flying sequence), front projection was used. This involved photographing the actors suspended {{in front of a}} background image dimly projected from the front onto a special screen made by 3M that would reflect light back at many times the original intensity directly into a combined camera/projector. The result was a very clear and intense photographic reproduction of both the actors and the background plate, with far less image deterioration or lighting problems than occur with rear projection.|$|E
5|$|Despite Pauline's pleas {{that the}} duel is a trap, Silence stands outside the saloon. A killer shoots his left hand, greatly {{impairing}} his speed and marksmanship. Loco then {{stands in the}} doorway, ready to face the weakened Silence. As Silence begins reaching for his Mauser, Loco reaches for his Colt Single Action Army – but as Silence draws, another wounding <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> fired. Loco fires at Silence's head, killing him. Distraught, Pauline attempts to shoot Loco herself, but swiftly dies as well. The bounty killers turn their guns on the outlaws, massacring the entire group. As Loco and his men prepare to collect their bounties, he takes Silence's Mauser from Pauline's hands. The killers ride out of Snow Hill into the morning sun. A title card explains that Loco's actions resulted in public condemnation of bounty killing, and a memorial was erected in Snow Hill to honor those who died by his greed.|$|E
5|$|No player {{along the}} lane may enter the key until the <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> released; the player {{shooting}} the free throw, and anyone {{on top of}} the key, should not pass the free throw line until the ball hits the rim. If any of the offensive players violate the rule, no points are awarded for the shot and, if there are no more shots remaining, the ball is given to the defending team. If a defending player is in the lane too soon, an extra shot will be awarded regardless of whether the shot was made or missed.|$|E

5|$|The Lucky <b>Shot</b> <b>is</b> a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The plot is follows Jack Hunt, {{the son of a}} wealthy woman, who weds a chorus singer Nell Horsley. Jack's mother forgives the son's error, but rejects his wife. Then Jack is killed while on strike duty in the local militia and the Nell and her child struggle in poverty. Nell begs her mother-in-law for aid, but the woman is enraged and drops dead. Her property goes to the young boy who saves the finical future of the family by finding a hidden fortune with a lucky shot while playing 'Indian'. Released on July 12, 1910, the film received positive attention and saw an international release. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|The {{critically}} endangered California condor {{has also}} been affected by lead poisoning. As scavengers, condors eat carcasses of game that have been shot but not retrieved, and with them the fragments from lead bullets; this increases their lead levels. Among condors around the Grand Canyon, lead poisoning due to eating lead <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> the most frequently diagnosed cause of death. In an effort to protect this species, in areas designated as the California condor's range the use of projectiles containing lead has been banned to hunt deer, feral pigs, elk, pronghorn antelope, coyotes, ground squirrels, and other non-game wildlife. Also, conservation programs exist which routinely capture condors, check their blood lead levels, and treat cases of poisoning.|$|E
5|$|The team's {{previous}} experience was with turn-based combat games, and it struggled {{to develop a}} real-time combat system affected by customizable attributes and abilities that provided feedback to the player on how those statistics were affecting the battle. It initially found that by adhering too closely to the White Wolf source material rules for guns, where {{the effectiveness of a}} <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> determined in a contest between the player's skill and the opponent's defense, the firearms seemed broken; the player would not hit where they aimed. Troika found it difficult to mesh the available factors in a real-time setting. Melee combat had to deal with a variety of melee weapons and animations and adjust for melee-on-melee and melee-on-ranged combat.|$|E

5|$|These {{are used}} when the casting alloy {{cannot be used}} in hot-chamber machines; these include aluminium, zinc alloys with a large {{composition}} of aluminium, magnesium and copper. The process for these machines start with melting the metal in a separate furnace. Then a precise amount of molten metal is transported to the cold-chamber machine where it is fed into an unheated shot chamber (or injection cylinder). This <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> then driven into the die by a hydraulic or mechanical piston. The biggest disadvantage of this system is the slower cycle time due {{to the need to}} transfer the molten metal from the furnace to the cold-chamber machine.|$|E
5|$|Videoball plays as a {{two-dimensional}} hybrid of air hockey and soccer {{on a single}} screen. Players form two teams of one to three players. Each player uses an analog stick to control a triangle-shaped avatar and presses a single button to shoot triangle-shaped projectiles. The object {{of the game is}} to knock one or more circular balls into the opposing team's goal. Players hold the button to charge a shot, which fires upon release. The projectile can propel the ball, block other projectiles, and incapacitate opponents. Since the <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> triangle-shaped, it can only drive the ball for some distance before the ball veers off-course.|$|E
5|$|Angered by the situation, {{the group}} and their {{supporters}} decide to protest peacefully at India Gate, a war memorial in New Delhi. Police forcefully break up their protest using batons; in the process, Rathod's mother (Waheeda Rehman) is severely injured and slips into a coma. DJ, Karan, Aslam, Sukhi, and Laxman decide that they must emulate the early freedom fighters and resort to violence to achieve justice. As a result, they kill the defence minister to avenge Rathod's death, while Karan murders his father for his corrupt actions. The minister {{is reported to have}} been killed by terrorists and is hailed as a martyr by the media. To bring forth their intentions behind the killings, the five of them attempt to reach the public through a radio station. They forcibly take over the All India Radio station premises after having evacuated its employees. Karan goes on air and reveals the truth about the defence minister and his wrongdoings. While still on the air, the police proclaim that they are dangerous terrorists who have forcefully taken over the AIR, and therefore they are to be shot on sight. The first to be <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> Daljit, who tries to get out of cover and establish that they are not terrorists. Sukhi, unable to control his anger, shows himself and is instantly shot. As they are trying to lock the terrace doors, Aslam and Pandey are then killed by a grenade and the once archenemies die holding hands and smiling, as they have visions of Ram Prasad Bismil and Ashfaqullah Khan.|$|E
50|$|Extreme long <b>shots</b> <b>are</b> usually {{done in a}} {{high angle}} so the viewer can look down upon a setting or scene. Extreme longs <b>shots</b> <b>are</b> used mainly to open the scene or {{narrative}} and show the viewer the setting. The rest of the <b>shots</b> <b>are</b> most typically done in an eye level or point of view <b>shot</b> although it <b>is</b> possible to do any shot with any angle. There <b>is</b> the long <b>shot</b> which shows the subject even though the setting still dominates the picture frame.|$|R
5000|$|Lead <b>shot</b> <b>was</b> {{produced}} by dropping molten lead through a colander {{at the top}} of the tower: as it fell and cooled, the lead formed into spherical droplets, which solidified when they hit a trough of water at the bottom of the tower. The production of shot suitable for contemporary muzzle loading sports guns was completed in several stages. [...] First, after drying the <b>shot,</b> it <b>was</b> rolled down inclined glass planes to remove defective (irregularly shaped) pellets. It was then polished in a revolving cask using plumbago (graphite), which also blackened it. Finally, the <b>shot</b> <b>was</b> passed through a tower of 10 sieves which sorted it by diameter. The graded <b>shot</b> <b>was</b> packaged in hand sewn linen bags; at the height of production, 100 tons of <b>shot</b> <b>were</b> produced each year.|$|R

5|$|Qwak! is a single-player duck hunting light gun shooter arcade game {{in which}} the player uses a rifle-shaped light gun to fire at targets on the screen. One duck at a time flies across the screen, with each duck {{appearing}} {{in a different place}} {{on the sides of the}} screen and flying in different paths. The player is allowed three shots to hit the duck as it flies across the screen. As with other light gun games, a hit is registered if the gun is pointed at the duck or similar light source when the trigger is pulled; no projectile is fired. When a <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> fired, a mark appears on the screen where the player was aiming; if the shot misses the duck, it changes direction away from the bullet. If the player hits a duck, it falls to the ground, and a hunting dog runs over and collects it. Each duck hit adds a small image of a duck to a row at the top of the screen. An screen overlay shows an image of marsh reeds and a tree branch. The gun is attached to the game cabinet by a metal cord, and is holstered in a small circular recess in the cabinet when not in use. Attempting to remove the gun sounds an alarm buzzer. Each game costs a quarter, and runs until the time limit runs out. Machines have adjustable time limits or can be set to run each game indefinitely, starting the score count over when the start button is pressed.|$|E
5|$|Six {{teams from}} North America and six teams {{representing}} {{the rest of}} the World play a series of games against each other in order to win points. The first side to win a majority of the points available wins the cup. Teams compete in four formats: team games, mixed doubles games, singles competitions, and skins games. Team games are regular curling games, with two teams of four playing against each other. Mixed doubles games involve two teams, each consisting of one male and one female, playing against each other. Mixed doubles teams use only six stones per end, one of which is positioned {{prior to the start of}} the end. This is in contrast to the eight stones per end used by teams of four in regular curling games. The singles competition involves two teams playing against each other. There are six types of shots contested in the singles competitions. Each curler from each team is assigned to throw at least one type of shot. Points are given based on how well the <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> made. After all of the shots have been thrown, the team with the most points wins the competition. Skins games involve two teams playing against each other, where the objective is to win skins by scoring two or more points with the hammer or stealing points without the hammer. The points for the skins games, which go toward the total points for the cup, are distributed throughout the game, and the teams earn these points by winning skins.|$|E

Saint Mary Lake and Wild Goose Island in Glacier National Park, Montana was the filming location for the aerial shots of the opening scenes, with the Volkswagen Beetle driving along Going-to-the-Sun Road. The Timberline Lodge on Mount Hood in Oregon was filmed for a few of the exterior shots of the fictional Overlook Hotel; notably absent in these <b>shots</b> <b>is</b> the hedge maze, something the Timberline Lodge does not have.|$|R
50|$|The British Army {{released}} a statement after the shootings in which they claimed that between 23.45 and 03.00 there was a severe gun battle in the New Lodge area. In about 30 separate incidents, nearly 200 <b>shots</b> <b>were</b> fired at the security forces and fire was returned on most occasions. They said that seven of the people <b>shot</b> <b>were</b> gunmen and six of them died, eyewitness claims dispute these statements claiming none of those <b>shot</b> <b>was</b> armed {{at the time they}} were killed.|$|R
