40|$|Of {{the many}} known stoichiometries and crystal phases of {{manganese}} oxide, {{a select few}} {{have been found to}} have remarkable properties for electrochemical <b>charge</b> <b>storage.</b> Among these are hollandite α-MnO 2 and spinel λ-MnO 2, which are studied in this work. α-Mn O 2 has been observed to have a high electrochemical <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> capacity with incredible rate capability and cycle lifetime in aqueous alkali salt electrolytes. In these conditions, this material also exhibits the unique property of pseudocapacitance, meaning that the electrochemical behavior mimics the properties of a parallel-plate dielectric capacitor. However, the underlying mechanism for <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> in α-MnO 2, and the origins of pseudocapacitance are generally not understood. Conversely, λ-MnO 2 is a well-studied cathode for lithium ion batteries with a high capacity and rate for <b>charge</b> <b>storage,</b> which is known to degrade quickly, especially at elevated temperatures. In this work, we study both pseudocapacitive Mn O 2 and λ-MnO 2 using computational chemistry and experimental techniques. Computationally, the <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> properties of these two materials are framed within a band-diagram and electronic structure framework to elucidate the e_ect of physical properties such as band gap, work function, point of zero charge, and pH on <b>charge</b> <b>storage.</b> Experimentally, thicknesses up to 200 nm of MnO grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) are converted by electrochemical treatment into pseudocapacitive NaMn 4 O 8 and spinel LiMn 2 O 4. By studying the electrochemical properties of pseudocapacitive NaMn 4 O 8 and spinel LiMn 2 O 4 at varying thicknesses, a more detailed mechanistic understanding for <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> in each material is established.

The main objective of the proposed algorithm is to maximize the total profit and to minimize the costs regarding the refinery process over a planning horizon. The refinery planning problem is solved in discrete time over a pre-determined prediction horizon and this prediction horizon is shifted by one time interval at each subsequent step where the optimization is repeated. To demonstrate the performance of this receding horizon strategy, two literature examples are introduced where the refinery process comprises the oil fields, crude oil vessels, the <b>storage,</b> <b>charge</b> and production tanks, {{as well as the}} crude distillation units (CDU).

30|$|At present, {{research}} on hybrid AC/DC microgrids is mainly {{focused on their}} control strategy, whereas there is relatively little {{research on}} their optimal operation [10]. In [11], a multi-time-scale optimization model, which adjusts the power distribution by considering the impact of real-time electricity prices and unbalanced power, is proposed to maximize the revenue of hybrid AC/DC microgrids. However, the cost model {{does not take into}} account the energy <b>storage</b> <b>charge</b> and discharge costs due to round-trip losses. In [5] a two-layer optimization control model is proposed, which includes the system layer and the equipment layer. The system layer model optimizes the unit combination to realize the power balance, and the equipment layer is designed to stabilize the AC and DC voltages. However, neither paper discusses the negative effects of uncertainty from intermittent energy on the operation of hybrid AC/DC microgrids. The output power of widely used intermittent energy sources, such as wind power and photovoltaic power, often deviate from the predicted value.|$|E
40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of global ocean transportation, storage space in container terminals {{is becoming a}} scarce resource.

Recent studies have confirmed {{that they are not}} normally distributed over time. The increase in renewable energy installation has brought the issue of energy <b>storage</b> <b>charge</b> and discharge control. Thus, storage control methods that properly address non-normality are required. In this paper, we formulated the economically optimal storage control problem using Markov decision process (MDP) and the conditional value at risk (CVaR) measure to deal with the non-normality of predictive distribution about the household’s net load. The CVaR measure was employed to treat with the chance constraint on the battery capacitor, in other words, overcharge risk and over-discharge risk. We conducted a simulation to compare the annual economic saving performances between two MDPs: one is the MDP with a Gaussian predictive distribution and the other is the MDP with a normalized frequency distribution (non-normal).
