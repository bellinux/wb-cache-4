5|$|The most {{important}} East–West <b>shipping</b> <b>lane</b> in the Baltic Sea passed the Hiiu sandbank. Already {{before the year}} 1490 the Hanseatic merchants were seeking permission to mark this peninsula with an outstanding landmark. Around 1490 they asked the bishop of Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek to let them build a landmark on the Kõpu peninsula which was under the bishop’s control. This action had no real results.|$|E

Passing east of Okinawa and spotting no ships, she cruised south arriving at the Guam-Leyte <b>shipping</b> <b>lane</b> on 27 July. She spotted a tanker escorted by a destroyer and Hashimoto ordered her to launch two kaitens at 14:31 and 14:43. She heard explosions at 15:21 and 15:31 but her crew was unable to determine if the kaitens had struck their targets. Hashimoto reported a tanker assumed sunk.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Miami Tunnel project {{involved}} {{the design and}} widening of the MacArthur Causeway by one lane in each direction {{leading up to the}} tunnel entrance, the relocation of Parrot Jungle Trail, and the reconstruction of roadways on Dodge Island. The tunnel itself has two side by side tubes carrying traffic underneath the cruise ship channel of the Government Cut <b>shipping</b> <b>lane.</b> Jacobs Engineering Group was responsible for the design of the roadways, Langan Engineering & Environmental Services was the geotechnical engineer, and Bouygues was the prime contractor for the tunnel project itself. Chosen due to their key involvement {{in the construction of the}} Channel Tunnel, a major tunnel in Europe, the selection of Bouygues was also met with controversy and protested by the Cuban exile community in Miami, due to the company's involvement with locally opposed construction projects in Cuba.|$|E

Facing the western coast of Peninsular Malaysia there is the Straits of Malacca towards the south, and the Andaman Sea towards the north.

25|$|On 19 September 1943, Sisu {{struck a}} Soviet mine {{that had been}} dropped on the <b>shipping</b> <b>lane</b> west of the island fort of Rysäkari off Helsinki. While no-one was injured, the {{explosion}} damaged the propeller shafts and the icebreaker had to be towed to Hietalahti Shipyard for extensive repairs. While the vessel returned to service three months later, these damages were never fully repaired and followed Sisu until her final decommissioning in the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|Departing Milne Bay, New Guinea, on 13 November for {{her first}} war patrol, Ray searched the area north of the Bismarck Archipelago. On the New Hanover-Truk <b>shipping</b> <b>lane,</b> she made radar contact with a three-ship convoy, escorted by three patrol craft. Attacking just before dawn she scored three hits {{on one of the}} freighters. Then, after evading the escorts' countermeasures, she {{followed}} the convoy and sank the converted gunboat Nikkai Maru with a spread of torpedoes. Before ending her patrol in December, Ray twice unsuccessfully attacked another convoy.|$|E

The container terminal at the Port of Kingston has undergone large expansion in capacity {{in recent years to}} handle growth both already realised as well as that which is projected in coming years. Montego Freeport in Montego Bay also handles a variety of cargo like (though more limited than) the Port of Kingston, mainly agricultural products.|$|E
25|$|The Dover Harbour Board is the {{responsible}} {{authority for the}} running of the Port of Dover. The English Channel, here at its narrowest point in the Straits of Dover, is the busiest <b>shipping</b> <b>lane</b> in the world. Ferries crossing between here and the Continent have to negotiate their way through the constant stream of shipping crossing their path. The Dover Strait Traffic Separation Scheme allots ships separate lanes when passing through the Strait. The Scheme is controlled by the Channel Navigation Information Service based at Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre Dover. MRCC Dover is also charged with co-ordination of civil maritime search and rescue within these waters.|$|E

25|$|In June 2009, Toowoomba sailed from Fleet Base West, Western Australia {{to embark}} upon the ship's second MEAO deployment. In September, the frigate was {{assigned}} to Combined Task Force 151 (CTF-151); Toowoomba was the first Australian warship to work with CTF-151, a US-led, multinational force tasked with protecting merchant vessels from pirate attacks {{off the coast of}} Somalia. Toowoomba {{was assigned to}} escort merchant shipping and conduct overt patrols in the International Recommended Transit Corridor (IRTC), a <b>shipping</b> <b>lane</b> extending the Gulf of Aden towards the Somali Basin and the Horn of Africa, in support of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1846 and 1851. The frigate was also the first to operate with the counter-terrorism Combined Task Force 150 (CTF-150) in the Arabian Sea.|$|E
25|$|The man {{is passed}} by two {{container}} ships, {{which do not}} see him, despite his use of signaling flares. He drifts out of the <b>shipping</b> <b>lane</b> with no food and water. On the eighth day, he writes a letter, puts it in a jar, and throws it in the water as a message in a bottle. Later that night, he sees a light in the distance. He tears pages from his journal along with charts to create a signal fire. The fire grows {{out of control and}} consumes his raft. He falls into the water and allows himself to sink. Underwater, he sees the hull of a boat with a search light approaching his burning raft. He swims up towards the surface to grasp an outstretched hand.|$|E
25|$|The {{regiment}} relieved 2nd S/L Rgt on the Scheldt on 23 January, with Regimental HQ at Goes on South Beveland, 1st S/L Bty HQ at 's-Heerenhoek and 2nd S/L Bty HQ at Krabbendijke. These two batteries {{took over}} a permanent radar watch to provide early warning for the LAA units deployed with them. The regiment also supplied the S/Ls for two Landing Craft Flak operating in the estuary under 124th (Highland) LAA Rgt. The AA units on the Scheldt were employed both in the AA and coastal defence role, because of German miniature submarines infiltrating into the <b>shipping</b> <b>lane.</b> 7th Searchlight Battery was detached and deployed at Brasschaat near Antwerp on anti-Diver duties under 5th Royal Marine AA Brigade. On 25 February a V-1 hit inflicted casualties of five killed, two missing and six wounded on this battery.|$|E

25|$|Moshe Dayan was {{covering}} the Vietnam War to observe modern warfare up close {{after he left}} political life. In fact, he was on patrol as an observer {{with members of the}} US Marine Corps. Although Dayan did not take part in most of the planning before the Six-Day War of June 1967, he personally oversaw the capture of East Jerusalem during the 5–7 June fighting. During the years following the war, Dayan enjoyed enormous popularity in Israel and was widely viewed as a potential Prime Minister. At this time, Dayan was the leader of the hawkish camp within the Labor government, opposing a return to anything like Israel's pre-1967 borders. He once said that he preferred Sharm-al-Sheikh (an Egyptian town on the southern edge of the Sinai Peninsula overlooking Israel's <b>shipping</b> <b>lane</b> to the Red Sea via the Gulf of Aqaba) without peace, to peace without Sharm-al-Sheikh. He modified these views later in his career and {{played an important role in}} the eventual peace agreement between Israel and Egypt.|$|E
25|$|In November 2011, Shell Oil Company {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} with Arctia Offshore and chartered the Finnish multipurpose icebreakers Fennica and Nordica to serve as primary ice management vessels in the Chukchi Sea during the summer seasons of 2012–2014. The primary purpose of Nordica was to protect the drilling platform Kulluk by steering large ice floes so that they don't endanger the drilling operation. The decision to charter the Finnish icebreakers to support Arctic offshore drilling was widely criticized due potential environmental damage in case of oil spill. On 16 March 2012, some 52 Greenpeace activists from five different countries boarded Fennica and Nordica at Arctech Helsinki Shipyard to protest Shell's drilling operations in Alaska. The protests continued on May Day when the 52 activists from 15 different countries tried again to prevent Nordica from leaving Helsinki. On 3 May, while Nordica was passing the Swedish island of Öland in the Baltic Sea, six Greenpeace activists boarded the icebreaker, forcing the vessel to stop at Karlskrona where the protesters were arrested by the Swedish police and coast guard. Finally, in the following night 14 activists forced Nordica to carry out evasive manoeuvres in the sea region between Denmark and Germany by stopping boats {{in the middle of}} the <b>shipping</b> <b>lane</b> in front of the icebreaker and even swimming in the sea.|$|E
