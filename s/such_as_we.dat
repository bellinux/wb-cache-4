5|$|These flights covered {{performance}} tests <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> do on planes undergoing Navy tests. The very first flight exposed {{weaknesses of the}} Zero which our pilots could exploit with proper tactics... immediately apparent {{was the fact that}} the ailerons froze up at speeds above 200 knots so that rolling maneuvers at those speeds were slow and required much force on the control stick. It rolled to the left much easier than to the right. Also, its engine cut out under negative acceleration due to its float-type carburetor. We now had the answer for our pilots who were being outmaneuvered and unable to escape a pursuing Zero: Go into a vertical power dive, using negative acceleration if possible to open the range while the Zero's engine was stopped by the acceleration. At about 200 knots, roll hard right before the Zero pilot could get his sights lined up.|$|E

Of his seventy to ninety screenplays, he wrote many anonymously to avoid the British boycott of his work in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The boycott was a response to Hecht's active support of paramilitary action against British forces in Palestine and sabotaging British property there (see below), during which time a supply ship to Palestine was named the S. S. Ben Hecht.|$|E

500|$|Johnson did {{not attempt}} to create schools of {{theories}} to analyse the aesthetics of literature. Instead, he used his criticism for the practical purpose of helping others to better read and understand literature. When it came to Shakespeare's plays, Johnson emphasised the role of the reader in understanding language: [...] "If Shakespeare has difficulties above other writers, it is to be imputed to the nature of his work, which required the use of common colloquial language, and consequently admitted many phrases allusive, elliptical, and proverbial, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> speak and hear every hour without observing them".|$|E
500|$|Captain James Cook saw Mt. Redoubt {{during the}} summer of 1778, {{describing}} it as [...] "emitting a white smoke but no fire which made some think it {{was no more than a}} white thick cloud <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have frequently seen on the Coast, for the most part appearing on the sides of hills and often extends along a whole range and at different times falls or rises, expands or contracts itself and has a resemblance to Clouds of white smoke. But this besides being too small for one of those clouds, remained as it were fixed in the same spot for the whole time the Mountain was clear which was above 48 hours."

5|$|A {{number of}} white jazz musicians {{regularly}} {{performed at the}} club alongside blacks. Jazz guitarist Pat Martino recalls that he began playing at the club as a teenager (in the late 1950s), and would often play until 4am in the morning.

2500|$|The unicorn, tamable only by {{a virgin}} woman, was well {{established}} in medieval lore by the time Marco Polo described them as [...] "scarcely smaller than elephants. They have the hair of a buffalo and feet like an elephant's. They have a single large black horn {{in the middle of}} the forehead... They have a head like a wild boar's… They spend their time by preference wallowing in mud and slime. They are very ugly brutes to look at. They are not at all <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> describe them when we relate that they let themselves be captured by virgins, but clean contrary to our notions." [...] It is clear that Marco Polo was describing a rhinoceros. In German, since the 16th century, Einhorn ("one-horn") has become a descriptor of the various species of rhinoceros.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Kennedy also concurred, and {{proposed}} yet another test. [...] He {{wrote that he}} [...] "would apply a narrower test applicable only in the infrequent case, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have here, in which the two-step interrogation technique was used in a calculated way to undermine the Miranda warning." [...] If a two-step procedure was deliberately used, the subsequent statement would be inadmissible unless the police [...] "cured" [...] the problem by taking measures that would enable the suspect to distinguish the first interrogation from the second [...] "and appreciate that the interrogation has taken a new turn." [...] Kennedy suggested that a long break between the two interrogations would usually be sufficient, as would an explanation to the suspect that the first statement would probably be inadmissible in court.|$|E
2500|$|To {{argue in}} favor of this thesis, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, a {{prominent}} German philosopher, says, [...] "The senses, although they are necessary for all our actual knowledge, are not sufficient to give us the whole of it, since the senses never give anything but instances, that is to say particular or individual truths. Now all the instances which confirm a general truth, however numerous they may be, are not sufficient to establish the universal necessity of this same truth, for it does not follow that what happened before will happen in the same way again. … From which it appears that necessary truths, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> find in pure mathematics, and particularly in arithmetic and geometry, must have principles whose proof does not depend on instances, nor consequently on the testimony of the senses, although without the senses it would never have occurred to us to think of them…" ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{with each}} of the other Neolithic sites, the {{comparison}} is based on only a handful of isolated pictures, and there is again no evidence of use in strings of symbols <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> would expect with true writing – none of these appear jointly. Wáng Níngshēng thus concluded that they are marks of personal or clan identity rather than writing. According to Wáng, [...] "True writing begins when it represents sounds and consists of symbols that are able to record language. The few isolated figures found on pottery still cannot substantiate this point." [...] Keightley opines that [...] "they probably served as emblems of ownership or identity on these pots and jades, rather than as words in a writing system". Boltz agrees that they may have been [...] "the pre-Shang counterpart to the Shang clan-name insignia" [...] (p.48), but contrasts this with an actual writing system, for which there isn't any evidence at that time (p.51–52), while Qiu concludes: ...|$|E
