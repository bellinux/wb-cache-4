5|$|While Philip {{was walking}} through Abydos, he <b>saw</b> <b>people</b> killing {{themselves}} and their families by stabbing, burning, hanging, and jumping down wells and from rooftops. Philip was surprised to see this, and published a proclamation announcing that would give three day's grace to anybody wishing to commit suicide. The Abydenians, who were bent on following the orders of the original decree, thought that this would amount to treason to the people who had already died, and refused to live under these terms. Apart from those in chains or similar restraints, each family individually hurried to their deaths.|$|E

Although he only saw Gaddafi at one game, he met Gaddafi's sons Al-Saadi and Mutassim and {{considered}} following their footsteps into the oil business. In his first few weeks in Benghazi, he witnessed several protests against Gaddafi but relatively little violence. In addition, he <b>saw</b> <b>people,</b> including his teammates, gathering ammunition and weapons to prepare for the revolution.|$|E
25|$|As our {{television}} sets show bombers preparing for war against Iraq, we survivors of Guernica and Dresden recall our own helplessness and horror {{when we were}} flung into the inferno of bombing—we <b>saw</b> <b>people</b> killed. Suffocated. Crushed. Incinerated. Mothers trying to protect their children with only their bodies. Old people with no strength left to flee from the flames. These pictures are still alive in our memory, and our accounts capture indelibly what we went through.|$|E

25|$|People in the {{immediate}} area and from across London rallied to assist victims of the fire, in a response that <b>saw</b> <b>people</b> of all ages, races and social classes come together. Donations of food, water, toys, and clothes were made. St Clement's Church, Treadgold Street and St James' Church, Norlands, in the Deanery of Kensington, provided shelter for people evacuated from their homes, as did nearby mosques and temples. Notting Hill Methodist Church near to Grenfell tower became a focus of tributes and held regular vigils for the victims.|$|E

He has said in Vitamin Retailer Magazine that Water Works started the day he <b>saw</b> <b>people</b> weeping over water related deaths. The Fort Lauderdale Daily News boasted Kershaw using its airport as his launch pad to give people clean water. They reported him saying it is his oasis in between trips and it's the crew's production home base to debrief before flying all over the world. The Lodi news said while Kershaw was in Indonesia he lost ten pounds from a water borne illness and a doctor traveled to document Kershaw's condition.|$|E
25|$|JCP {{had almost}} {{accomplished}} {{its goal of}} creating a national promotion. Between the purchasing of several NWA territories, World Class Championship Wrestling in Texas leaving the NWA in 1986 (and later merging with Jerry Jarrett's Championship Wrestling Alliance in Memphis to create the United States Wrestling Association brand), and the once highly viable Pacific Northwest territory, {{as it had been}} known, closing in 1992, WCW was the last bastion of the NWA, and the last member with national television exposure. Since it was all they now <b>saw,</b> <b>people</b> began to believe that WCW was the NWA. Although WCW and the NWA were still two separate entities, with Crockett as NWA President, they were very much on the same page. The NWA was effectively an on-paper organization funded by Jim Crockett Promotions, and allowed JCP to use the NWA brand name for promoting.|$|E

25|$|Bryant {{then moved}} towards the coaches. One {{of the coach}} drivers, Royce Thompson, {{was shot in the}} back as he was moving along the passengers' side of a coach. He fell to the ground and was able to crawl, then roll under the bus to safety, but later died of his wounds. Brigid Cook was trying to guide a number of people down between the buses and along the jetty area to cover. Bryant moved to the front of this bus and walked across to the next coach. People had quickly moved from this coach towards the back end, in an attempt to seek cover. As Bryant walked around it, he <b>saw</b> <b>people</b> {{scrambling}} to hide and shot at them. Brigid Cook was shot in the right thigh, causing the bone to fragment, the bullet lodging there. A coach driver, Ian McElwee, was hit by fragments of Miss Cook's bone. Both were able to escape and survived.|$|E

500|$|Vladimir Bukovsky, {{well known}} for his {{struggle}} against political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union, explained that using psychiatry against dissidents was usable to the KGB because hospitalization {{did not have an}} end date, and, as a result, there were cases when dissidents were kept in psychiatric prison hospitals for 10 or even 15 years. [...] "Once they pump you with drugs, they can forget about you", he said and added, [...] "I <b>saw</b> <b>people</b> who basically were asleep for years." ...|$|E

[...] Despite the cessation of the Sheriff's March in 1838, Clements' establishment became [...] "the social centre of the growing village, where concerts, dinners and meetings of all kinds were held".|$|E

[...] On May 13, two A-7D Corsairs saw the 39 man crew board a fishing boat and <b>saw</b> <b>people</b> disembarking fishing boats at Koh Tang Island. They assumed that the Mayaguez crew was on the island. Elements of the 1st Battalion, 4th Marines, the 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines, and the 2nd Battalion, 9th Marines, were flown to an advanced staging of a joint US Task Force. [...] On May 14, the Marines from Company D, 1st Battalion, 4th Marines boarded the Mayaguez only to find it deserted and raised the American flag.

500|$|Throughout {{the day of}} 2 August the besieged party heard distant cannon {{fire and}} <b>saw</b> <b>people</b> in the town hurriedly loading carts with their belongings. The {{constant}} fire from muskets on the building lessened and finally ceased; it was approached by two men, who told the occupants that the besiegers were defeated and a relief force was expected to arrive in Arrah the following day. The occupants were sceptical, despite visual evidence, and sent out a small party at midnight to reconnoitre the area—they found {{no sign of the}} mutineers and brought in a large quantity of gunpowder and the mutineers' two artillery pieces. They then sent a party under cover of darkness to destroy a number of outhouses which the mutineers had been using as cover. This party discovered a mine dug directly under the foundations of the building by the mutineers, charged and ready to be primed, so this charge was destroyed by them. The following morning at about 7:00am, two members of Major Eyre's expedition arrived at the house and the siege was officially broken. Eyre, in his official report, wrote that Wake's defence of the building [...] "seems to have been almost miraculous." [...] About the outcome of the first relief attempt, he wrote: [...] "I venture to affirm, confidently, that no such disaster would have been likely to occur, had that detachment advanced less precipitately, so as to have given full time for my force to approach direct from the opposite side, for the rebels would then have been hemmed in between the two opposing forces, and must have been utterly routed." ...|$|E

500|$|With {{his wife}} {{administering}} the campaign organization, Sunday {{was free to}} do what he did best: compose and deliver colloquial sermons. Typically, Homer Rodeheaver would first warm up the crowd with congregational singing that alternated with numbers from gigantic choirs and music performed by the staff. When Sunday felt the moment right, he would launch into his message. Sunday gyrated, stood on the pulpit, ran from one end of the platform to the other, and dove across the stage, pretending to slide into home plate. Sometimes he even smashed chairs to emphasize his points. His sermon notes had to be printed in large letters so that he could catch a glimpse of them as he raced by the pulpit. In messages attacking sexual sin to groups of men only, Sunday could be graphic for the era. A theological opponent, Universalist minister Frederick William Betts, wrote, [...] "Many of the things said and done bordered upon things prohibited in decent society. The sermon on amusements was preached three times, to mixed audience of men and women, boys and girls. If the sermons to women had been preached to married women, if the sermons to men had been preached to mature men, if the sermon on amusements had been preached to grown folks, there might have been an excuse for them, and perhaps good from them. But an experienced newspaper reporter told me that the sermon on amusements was 'the rawest thing ever put over in Syracuse.' I can not, must not, quote from this sermon...", [...] "fainted under that awful definition;", [...] "if you do not 'hit the trail' then watch out for the fireworks"... says that Mr. Sunday's sermon on the sex question was raw and disgusting. He also heard the famous sermons on amusements and booze. [...] says that all in all they were the ugliest, nastiest, most disgusting addresses he ever listened to from a religious platform or a preacher of religion. He <b>saw</b> <b>people</b> carried out who had fainted under that awful definition of sensuality and depravity.|$|E
