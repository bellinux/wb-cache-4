40|$|A rather broad {{investigation}} was carried {{on in the}} materials and methods which are considered possibly useful in forming ceramic to metal seals and composite structures {{for use in the}} environment of cesium-plasma thermionic converters. Initially, studies of five specific meands of joining refractory metals to alumina were undertaken, as well as studies of metallizing methods, of forming graded tungsten-alumina composites, and of the possible metals and ceramics which could be utilized best in structures operated at 2000 deg C. The five joining methods studied are: (1) Formation of a continuous electroplated layer of refractory metal across the adjacent surfaces of metal and ceramic. (2) Welding of a metal member to the ceramic by ultrasonic welding techniques; i. e., without heat. (3) Use of high temperature brazing alloys. (4) Formation of a bond between metal and ceramic by the diffusion of compatible intermediate materials into both structural members. (5) Welding of single oxide ceramics directly to refractory metals using electron-beam welding equipment. The study of metallizing methods was started because the first three of the joining methods listed require the use of a metallized surface of the alumina. It was determined that three of the five methods for joining refractory metals to alumina which were under study were not practically fessible. The methods considered impractical are: formation of a continuous electroplated joint, welding by ultrasonic energy, and welding with electron beam techniques. The studies on these methods were ended. Significant achievements {{have been made in the}} other studies. A metallizing process has been developed by which a strongly adherent sintered tungsten film can be applied to commercially available, high-purity, silica-free alumina. No fluxing materials or active metals which are susceptible to attack by cesium are used in this process. Bonding of alumina to molybdenum has been successful by several methods developed from the diffusion seal study. Some of these have been tested at 1500 deg C successfully, i. e., with neither structural failure nor loss of hermeticity resulting from the test. Methods of fabricating graded-composition, tungsten-alumina emitter and envelope <b>stractures</b> have been developed. Techniques for making brazed joints between refractory metals and high-purity alumina metallized with tungsten, using high temperature brazing alloys, are considered to be well enough developed for use of these structures near 1500 deg C. Diffusion joining methods for molybdenum or niobium and alumina are also considered to be processes which are immediately applicable to joining molybdenum or niobium and commercially available high-purity alumina for use at this temperature. Tungsten, rheniuan, hafnia, thoria, and yttria have been identified as the most promising materials for 2000 deg C service. The techniques developed for fabrication of tungsten-alumina composite bodies are considered to be directly applicable to formation of composite structures utilizing combinations of the materials for 2000 deg C service. Diffusion bonding of tungsten or rhenium to hafnia, thoria, or yttria demonstrates a high potential capability as a means of joining these materials for use at 2000 deg C. (auth...|$|E

30|$|Artificial {{polyploidy}} generally {{enhances the}} concentration of secondary metabolites (Lavania 2013). The mechanism to explain these changes relies {{on the assumption that}} chromosome doubling induces an increase in cell size the amount of genetic substance within the nuclei and the nuclear membrane decreases the chromatin is in contact with the nuclear membranes, thereby enhancing gene activity and photosynthetic rate on a per cell basis (Lavania and Lavania 2005; Levin 2002). It may be that with more chromatin coming into contact with the nuclear membrane due to the lower ratio of nuclear membrane to gene dosage after polyploidization, gene activity is elevated (Levin 2002). Changing the metabolic profile in autopolyploid plants by a simple duplication of the basic genome was interpreted as a cause of an alteration in the mechanism(s) which regulates the biosynthesis of individual compounds (Dehghan et al. 2012). Lipophilic flavonoid aglycones have a limited distribution in plants compared to their water-soluble glycosides. As they usually accumulate on the leaf surface, and are found in glandular trichomes or are extruded through the cuticle, they are known as surface or external flavonoids. Aglycone flavonoids, especially in the highly methylated form, accumulate in the Lamiaceae family (Tomás-Barberán and Wollenweber 1990). Therefore another possible reason for flavonoid methoxy enhancement can be because of high glandular trichomes <b>stracture</b> in tetraploid plants. To our knowledge there is only a few reports related to the effects of ploidy level on accumulation of medicinally important flavonoids.

With china's WTO accession looming after the 15 years of hard negotiations, it is virtually certain that China will further integrated into the world economic system and play a growing influence on the world economy and trade. As the shipping market is a derivative market of the intemational trade market, the events affecting the world economy and trade will also have dramatic effects on the shipping market.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{empowerment}} {{has been used}} extensively {{over the last decade}} in an attempt to improve clinical practice, to minimise power imbalances and to offer better care to consumers. Working collaboratively is seen as a cornerstone of empowerment and it is generally assumed that health professionals strive to achieve this in their clinical practice. This research investigates these issues within the context of alcohol and other drag (AOD) treatment. The study that is presented in this thesis was carried out in a variety of AOD treatment facilities including an in-patient detoxification unit, an AOD outpatients 2 ̆ 7 clinic, a methadone maintenance clinic, a residential detoxification and rehabilitation unit using a twelve-step treatment model and a residential unit using cognitive behavioural therapy. The non-probability sample consisted of fifty-seven staff and consumers who were interviewed in depth using a semi-stmctured interview format. Data were analysed using a modified grounded theory approach. The findings, which are summarized below, were further analysed using the 2 ̆ 7 frames of power 2 ̆ 7 developed by Michel Foucault. Although clinicians use the rhetoric of empowerment to explain how treatment is implemented, it is a contradictory discourse and it is compliance that they describe, not empowerment. Institutional arrangements assist in ensuring that empowerment does not happen. The major value underpinning practice is not empowerment but control. Clinical practice is concerned with who has control, who wants control and how control is maintained. Clinicians are afraid of losing power and employ discursive practices which serve to maintain their position and reinforce their notion of 2 ̆ 7 truth 2 ̆ 7. The real purpose of treatment accepted by both clinicians and consumers is to make people 2 ̆ 7 normal 2 ̆ 7. Women in AOD treatment face more difficulties in accessing treatment than do men. The dominant 12 -step abstinence philosophy was designed for men by men, and the organisational <b>stracture</b> of many treatment facilities is geared more towards the needs of men. AOD clinicians feel disempowered by the attitudes of other health professionals; by the attitudes of their own multi-disciplinary team; by the attitudes of clinicians from disciplines other than their own; and by the volatile and political nature of AOD policy and treatment. These are factors in {{the ways in which they}} disempower consumers. By exploring the notion of discourse and discursive practices, the link between power and knowledge assists in explaining why the 2 ̆ 7 taken for granted 2 ̆ 7 practices 2 ̆ 7 in AOD treatment occur and are perpetuated. The process by which consumers and clinicians are subjugated exposes the dominance of the medico-scientific disciplines and the dominant discourses that operate in AOD treatment. Foucault 2 ̆ 7 s metaphor of the panopticon is important in understanding issues of discipline, surveillance and the subsequent use of the gaze. Self-surveillance, the birth of the clinic and the production of docile bodies allow yet another way of viewing and understanding AOD treatment. Finally, the power of compliance, which is the unspoken goal of AOD treatment, can be clearly identified using a Foucauldian analysis...|$|R
40|$|Adolescent dehnquency is {{a growing}} social problem {{affecting}} individuals, families, and communities. The cunent research comprised three studies, which sought to explore the contribution of family and personality factors to self-reported delinquency, and to discover {{the nature of the}} relationship between perceptions of parental discipline style and perceptions of the seriousness of delinquent behaviour. The fust study examined the links between perceptions of family relationships, perceptions of parental discipline style, locus of control, self-esteem and selfreported delinquency among Australian high school stadents (N = 177). The prediction that locus of control and self-esteem would mediate the effects of family processes on delinquency was tested using stmctural equation modelling. Although there appeared to be a good fit between the data and the proposed model, the amount of variance explained by the predictor variables was not large. Among females, the best predictor of low levels of self-reported delinquency was an inductive discipline style, whilst for males high levels of self-reported delinquency were best predicted by a punitive discipline style. Among males, positive family relations was a significant predictor of high self-esteem. No mediating effects of self-esteem and locus of confrol were observed. Given these results and the findings of previous research indicating links between family process factors, Eysenck 2 ̆ 7 s Psychoticism (P) factor, and delinquency, the second study investigated the relationships between perceptions of parental discipline style, perceptions of parental bonding, P, and selfreported delinquency among a sample of delinquent youth (N = 39). It aimed to determine the intervening effect of P on family process factors and self-reported delinquency. As expected, this sample of delinquent youth obtained significantly higher delinquency scores than mainstream high school students, as well as significantly higher P levels than established norms. Scores on the parental bonding instmment differed significantly in the expected direction from nondelinquent students. Self-reported delinquency was significantly related to an inductive parental discipline style and high P levels. As predicted, P mediated the effect of inductive parenting on delinquency. The third study aimed to assess the <b>stracture</b> of adolescents 2 ̆ 7 and adults 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the seriousness of behaviours labelled as 2 ̆ 2 delinquent 2 ̆ 2, and to determine whether these perceptions vary across the sex of the respondent and sex of target (that is, the person engaging in the behaviour). A further aim was to examine whether these perceptions are linked to particular parenting discipline styles. The results indicated that, within a sample of high school students (N = 321) and their parents (N = 193), adolescent and adult perceptions of delinquent behaviours are multi-dimensional, possessing a particular stmcture. As expected, sex of target and sex of respondent were found to have some impact on adolescents 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of offence seriousness. Parental discipline style was found to be especially important in predicting the perceptions of adolescent boys rather than girls, as well as some perceptions of parents. In exanuning the contribution of family and personality factors to delinquency, all the studies in this research found parental discipline style to be a key variable. The results of the three studies are discussed with reference to previous research, recommendations for intervention and clinical practice are made, and implications of the findings for further research are noted...|$|R
