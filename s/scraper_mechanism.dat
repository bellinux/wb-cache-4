40|$|The {{system is}} {{particularly}} for disc- or washer-type workpieces of rigid or elastic material. These are discharged from a storage hopper (2) by a conveyor (8), with which a <b>scraper</b> <b>mechanism</b> (15) works, together forming the outlet gap (18). The conveyor {{can be of}} the linear type, particularly with a belt or vibrator. The scraper can be formed by a rotary component on a vertical or horizontal axis, and turning against the conveyor working direction or a rigid baffle plate. The height or width of the gap can be adjustable. The rotary component can have elastic lips, brushes or spherical bodies round the periphery.

40|$|AbstractThe {{increasing}} {{share of}} renewables in today's generation mix {{and the accompanying}} fluctuation in generation requires large scale as well as decentralized storage capacities to secure grid stability. In the described power-to-heat concept, electricity, produced from PV-plants or small scale wind farms, is used to heat up high temperature latent heat storages. The heat {{can be used in}} industrial processes. The storage is equipped with electrical heating elements, directly immerged into the phase change material to achieve best conversion efficiency. Discharging takes place by an oil cooled plate heat exchanger. For heat transfer enhancement during discharging, a concept, using moving blades to scrape off the solidifying material, was developed. With this method, the solidified layer of phase change material on the heat exchanger surface is kept at constant thickness, allowing for constant heat flux during the major period of the discharging process. Feasibility of the concept with moving scrapers was demonstrated, proving the advantages over the passive concept. Various aspects have been identified for improvement of the concept. In the second generation design it is intended to combine the electrical heating with the cooling plate to minimize the amount of components and material inside the storage and to maximize the available heat exchanger surface. With this solution, the same heat exchanger surface can be used for charging or discharging. Flat heat exchanger surfaces will allow a very narrow gap between scraper and heat exchanger plate. The mounting of the <b>scraper</b> <b>mechanism</b> is changed from a central slide to a portal frame, supported by four ball bearings. Two bearings each are guided in a track on each sides of the storage. For exact positioning in relation to the cooling plates, two bearings each are mounted {{in the middle of the}} traversal trusses, and guided along the middle track. The scraper is re-designed to also be able to scrape off solidifying salt at the bottom of the storage. In addition investigation are under way, to reduce the adhesion between PCM and heat exchanger surface by nanotechnology or any other means...|$|E
40|$|Scraping of the SPS beam will be {{required}} prior to extraction towards the LHC in order to remove the beam tails and ensure clean injection conditions. <b>Scraper</b> <b>mechanisms</b> recuperated from the ISR and collimators coming from LEP are installed since a few years in the SPS to test this concept. The purpose of these tests was to show that {{with the help of}} the associated two stage collimation system, it is possible to make the scraping process very clean by confining the losses at the collimator locations, hence without irradiating any other part of the machine...|$|R
