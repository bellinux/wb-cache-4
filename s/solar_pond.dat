40|$|Many {{natural systems}} such as oceans, lakes, etc [...] ., are {{influenced}} by the effect of double-diffusive convection. This phenomenon, which is a combination of heat and mass transfer, can destroy the stability of system-flows. In the case of <b>solar</b> <b>ponds</b> the middle layer, that is linearly stratified, acts as a thermal and mass insulator for the lower layer. This middle layer, called the Non-Convective Zone (NCZ), needs special care to avoid convection and to maintain its stability. In fact, due to an excess of heat stored, a thermal gradient occurs within the NCZ. A convective movement appears {{at the bottom of the}} stratified-layers and then grows to a double-diffusive convection movement. This movement transforms the stratified-layers into a well mixed layer, reducing the storage capacity of the pond.

A pond operating at a location in Singapore attains a fairly high temperature but the temperature requirements are also high for the desired applications such as space cooling in conjunction with a refrigeration cycle. Although a pond at Kew attains a lower temperature compared with a pond at Singapore, it can supply considerable amounts of thermal energy to support a space heating load.

5000|$|At the Eddy Potash Mine in New Mexico, a {{technology}} called [...] "salinity gradient solar pond" [...] (SGSP) is being utilized {{to provide the}} energy needed by the mine. This method does not harness osmotic power, only solar power (see: <b>solar</b> <b>pond).</b> Sunlight reaching {{the bottom of the}} saltwater pond is absorbed as heat. The effect of natural convection, wherein [...] "heat rises", is blocked using density differences between the three layers that make up the pond, in order to trap heat. The upper convection zone is the uppermost zone, followed by the stable gradient zone, then the bottom thermal zone. The stable gradient zone is the most important. The saltwater in this layer can not rise to the higher zone because the saltwater above has lower salinity and is therefore less-dense and more buoyant; and it can not sink to the lower level because that saltwater is denser. This middle zone, the stable gradient zone, effectively becomes an [...] "insulator" [...] for the bottom layer (although the main purpose is to block natural convection, since water is a poor insulator). This water from the lower layer, the storage zone, is pumped out and the heat is used to produce energy, usually by turbine in an organic Rankine cycle.|$|E

One of the most important topics to address at that time concerning physics was Turkish society's energy needs.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a novel heat extraction method, {{which can be}} operated in batch or continuous, modes for salinity gradient <b>solar</b> <b>ponds.</b> A comparison between the performance of two <b>solar</b> <b>ponds</b> {{of the same size}} (10, 000 m 2) in Adana (Turkey) and Ahvaz (Iran) is also presented. The heat extraction method entails brine removal from the non-convective zone (NCZ) as well as the heat storage zone (HSZ). The presented model incorporates the heat losses from the bottom and surface of the pond as well as the cooling effect imposed {{as a consequence of the}} replacement of extracted brine from each layer, and the supply of freshwater to the surface of the pond to maintain its inventory. The model can be employed to predict the performance of <b>solar</b> <b>ponds</b> of various dimensions for any given location. It was established that the pond modelled for Ahvaz would perform 30 % better than the pond in Adana in both batch and continuous heat extraction modes, predominantly due to the higher quantities of solar energy reaching the surface of the pond and the higher air temperatures throughout the year at this location. The quantities of heat provided in the first year of operation from the ponds in Adana and Ahvaz in batch mode extraction are 2. 8 x 106 MJ and 4. 0 x 106 MJ, respectively. These values are approximately three times higher than those from the continuous mode of heat extraction due to the larger volume of withdrawal in the batch mode. Using the proposed heat extraction method in batch mode, 85 % of the total heat is removed from the HSZ while this is just over 50 % for the continuous mode indicating the better energy storage performance of the batch mode. Both heat extraction modes offer an efficient mechanism of stabilising a temperature gradient throughout the pond with the aim of insulating the HSZ for heat storage. This is carried out by designating brine removal thresholds of 70 °C, 80 °C and 90 °C within the NCZ and 95 °C in the HSZ. It is also demonstrated that the requirement for the supply of freshwater to the surface of <b>solar</b> <b>ponds</b> is significantly dependant on the wind velocity at each location and is unaffected by the mode of heat extraction...|$|R
