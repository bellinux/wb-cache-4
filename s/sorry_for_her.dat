2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Jason Damas, {{in a review}} for PopMatters, felt that the song sounds [...] "almost exactly like Dizzee Rascal", and added, [...] "Lyrically, this is where Gwen sinks the lowest here, {{especially}} on a breakdown where she repeats, 'This shit is bananas / B-A-N-A-N-A-S!' several times".

I'd quote the lyrics, but they're so bad, I almost feel <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> A 35-year-old woman singing about pom-poms and 'talking shit' in high school betrays such a delusional self-image that it's {{hard not to be}} taken aback. And on top of that, The Neptunes' beats are clunky and the production is senselessly bombastic." [...] Nick Sylvester of Pitchfork also criticized the track, referring to it as a [...] "Queen pastiche [...] which has about as much club potential as a 13-year old with a milk moustache and his dad's ID".

Serena Williams expressed surprise at Sharapova’s announcement but commended her for being [...] "upfront with what she had done". Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray all publicly condemned Sharapova and argued that she deserved to be punished on the basis that she failed the doping test, with Murray adding that [...] "Taking a drug you don't necessarily need because it's legal is wrong" [...] and Federer stating that [...] "Whether it's intentional or not, I don't see too much difference. You must be 100 percent about what you are taking". Sharapova's case prompted Federer to urge the tennis federation to conduct more anti-doping tests. Novak Djokovic said that he felt <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> but that she must still be ready for punishment. Victoria Azarenka and Dominika Cibulkova were far less supportive, with Cibulkova adding that she didn't feel sorry at all for Sharapova and didn't miss having her on the tour, describing her as [...] "a totally unlikeable person; arrogant, conceited, and cold".

In her timeline, she {{sailed to}} Australia to deliver supplies aboard the upgraded nuclear submarine , captained by a reprogrammed Terminator, Queeg, {{of which she}} is the executive officer. Queeg diverts the submarine {{to pick up a}} package and return it to John Connor. Her crew is curious of what is in the package so they open it. Inside is a T-1001 and one of the crew members, a woman, points her gun at it. The T-1001 kills her and takes her form, then shakes its finger at the rest of the crew. Queeg kills a crewman after he beat on Jesse. Jesse does not trust Queeg so she relieves him of command. Queeg does not obey her orders so she terminates him and destroys the submarine in an attempt to kill the T-1001. On her way out, she encounters the T-1001 and it tells her, [...] "the answer is no." [...] In 2007, she is on a possibly self-imposed mission to find and stop Cameron from adversely influencing young John, by recruiting Riley Dawson in the future and bringing her back to frame Cameron for her murder. In the future from which Jesse comes, John has withdrawn from humans and speaks only with Cameron. It is unclear whether this mission is self-appointed, but comments by her and the fact she was able to access the time travel machinery with Riley suggests others in the Resistance leadership group may share her concerns about Cameron's influence on John. John Connor later figures out that Jesse killed Riley and informs Derek, but orders her life to be spared. Derek confronts Jesse. He tells her that they are from two different futures and that he doesn't know who she is. He tells her, [...] "John Connor wanted to let you go. I'm not John Connor." [...] He pulls his gun on her and she takes off running. Whether or not Derek actually kills her is left ambiguous, although he does pull the trigger on his handgun. When asked about it by John he just says, [...] "John Connor wanted to let her go." [...] This could either mean that he obeyed John Connor's order or since he is not John Connor, he didn't want to let her go and he shot her. Later on in a flashback, Cameron is seen talking to Jesse. Cameron tells her that she is <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> loss. She says that the pressure from leaving the submarine killed her baby, she was pregnant with Derek's baby. Jesse tells Cameron, [...] "Tell John Connor it said [...] "The answer is no"" [...] Then, Jesse asks Cameron, [...] "If the answer is no, what was the question?" [...] Cameron answers with, [...] "Will you join us?" [...] Cameron tells Derek about the miscarriage and he says he never had any kids.|$|E
