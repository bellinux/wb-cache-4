500|$|Potter {{completed}} {{the text of}} Timmy Tiptoes but decided it was too long. She was also uncertain exactly how to put the bird calls into print. She revised the text, and wrote publisher Harold Warne: [...] "I have compressed {{the words in the}} earlier pages, but it seems unavoidable to have a good deal of nuts. The songs of the little birds will be easier to judge as to spelling when one sees it in type." [...] The illustrations presented another problem. For her earlier productions, Potter was able to observe the <b>species</b> <b>concerned</b> in the wild, and kept specimens at home as pets and models. For Timmy Tiptoes however, she was unable to do so. Instead, she relied on specimens in the London Zoological Gardens as models, and checked photographs in reference books including one from the firm of taxidermist Rowland Ward. [...] "The book obtained from Rowland Ward will be very useful," [...] she wrote.|$|E
500|$|There are {{multiple}} ways {{to define the}} concept of [...] "species." [...] The choice of definition {{is dependent on the}} particularities of the <b>species</b> <b>concerned.</b> For example, some species concepts apply more readily toward sexually reproducing organisms while others lend themselves better toward asexual organisms. Despite the diversity of various species concepts, these various concepts can be placed into one of three broad philosophical approaches: interbreeding, ecological and phylogenetic. The Biological Species Concept (BSC) {{is a classic example of}} the interbreeding approach. Defined by Ernst Mayr in 1942, the BSC states that [...] "species are groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations, which are reproductively isolated from other such groups." [...] Despite its wide and long-term use, the BSC like others is not without controversy, for example because these concepts cannot be applied to prokaryotes, and this is called the species problem. Some researchers have attempted a unifying monistic definition of species, while others adopt a pluralistic approach and suggest that there may be different ways to logically interpret the definition of a species.|$|E

50|$|The {{water flow}} rate in a raceway system needs to be {{sufficiently}} high to meet the respiratory (dissolved oxygen) requirements for the <b>species</b> <b>concerned</b> and to flush out metabolic wastes, especially ammonia. In a well designed system, the existing water in the raceway is largely replaced by new water when the same volume of new water enters the raceway. Self-cleaning can sometimes be achieved if the fish stocks density is sufficiently high and the water level is sufficiently low. For example, if trout are stocked at 20 kilograms per cubic metre, they can keep the raceway unit clean by their swimming movements, preventing waste solids from settling to the raceway floor.|$|E

There are generally however more restrictions on such zoos (which may go as far as only holding non-breeding animals for educational purposes), and there are certainly restrictions on the number of programmes they may participate in.

40|$|Non-native {{salmonids}} {{are often}} introduced into areas containing <b>species</b> of <b>concern,</b> yet a comprehensive {{overview of the}} short- and long-term consequences of these introductions is lacking in the Great Plains. Several authors have suggested that non-native salmonids negatively influence <b>species</b> of <b>concern.</b> The objective {{of this paper is}} to review known interactions between non-native salmonids and native fishes, with a focus on native <b>species</b> of <b>concern.</b> After an extensive search of the literature, it appears that in many cases non-native salmonids do negatively influence <b>species</b> of <b>concern</b> (e. g., reduce abundance and alter behavior) via different mechanisms (e. g., predation and competition). However, there are some instances in which introduced salmonids have had no perceived negative influence on native fishes. Unfortunately, the majority of the literature is circumstantial, and there is a need to experimentally manipulate these interactions...|$|R
50|$|The genus Huernia (family Apocynaceae, {{subfamily}} Asclepiadoideae) {{consists of}} stem succulents from Eastern and Southern Africa, first {{described as a}} genus in 1810. The flowers are five-lobed, usually somewhat more funnel- or bell-shaped than in the closely related genus Stapelia, and often striped vividly in contrasting colours or tones, some glossy, others matt and wrinkled depending on the <b>species</b> <b>concerned.</b> To pollinate, the flowers attract flies by emitting a scent {{similar to that of}} carrion. The genus is considered close to the genera Stapelia and Hoodia. The name is in honour of Justin Heurnius (1587-1652) a Dutch missionary who is reputed to have been the first collector of South African Cape plants. His name was actually mis-spelt by the collector.|$|E
50|$|To {{test whether}} the {{hypothesis}} was true, experiments {{were performed on}} ground squirrels, cowbirds and golden hamsters. It was found that juvenile Belding's ground squirrels behaved differently when presented with plastic cubes rubbed with secretions from their relatives as compared to non-kin secretions. An experiment with chicks of brown-headed cowbirds provided evidence of self-referent phenotype matching, but in this case, a visual cue was used rather than an olfactory one. An experiment using young golden hamsters showed that they could recognise kin from non-kin even when, as infants, they {{had been removed from}} their mother at birth and reared by an unrelated female. In general, the armpit effect seems to exist and to be beneficial to the <b>species</b> <b>concerned</b> because it lessens the chance of inbreeding.|$|E
50|$|Within the retina, rod cells provide high visual {{sensitivity}} (at {{the cost}} of acuity), being used in low light conditions. Cone cells provide higher spatial and temporal resolution than rods can, and allow {{for the possibility of}} colour vision by comparing absorbances across different types of cones which are more sensitive to different wavelengths. The ratio of rods to cones depends on the ecology of the fish <b>species</b> <b>concerned,</b> e.g., those mainly active during the day in clear waters will have more cones than those living in low light environments. Colour vision is more useful in environments with a broader range of wavelengths available, e.g., near the surface in clear waters rather than in deeper water where only a narrow band of wavelengths persist.|$|E
