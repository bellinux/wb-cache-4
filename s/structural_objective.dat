40|$|The {{widening}} {{application of}} information and communication technology (ICT) in organizations alters the temporal and spatial circumstances under which work groups operate. Yet, time and space have not been major foci in the past work group research. Though temporal and spatial dispersion have been widely recognized in studies of work groups interacting with ICT, only few {{attempts have been made}} to examine the implications of changed operating logics of time and space as enabled by ICT. In this paper, we address this void. Specifically, we argue that, in addition to temporal and spatial dispersion, ICT in general, and mobile technology in particular, erect novel aspects of time (i. e., instantaneity and simultaneity) and space (i. e., independence from fixed places and fluidity of context), which enables novel forms of time-space configurations (i. e., multi-presence) that need to be carefully explored. We conceive that time and space can act both in independent and dependent variable roles in work group research. Moreover, we consider both the <b>structural</b> (<b>objective)</b> and experienced (interpretive) aspects of time and space as induced by ICT. Using these classifications we identify four major research challenges in time and space research related to ICT use in groups. To this end the paper suggests nine specific research questions that need to be engendered in future research on ICT use within work groups...|$|E
40|$|This article proposes {{an account}} of {{individual}} participation in social movements that combines structural and cultural factors. It aims to explain why certain activists continue {{to be involved in}} social movements while others withdraw. When activists remain embedded in social networks relevant for the protest issues and, above all, when they keep a symbolic linkage between their activism and their personal life-spheres, sustained participation is likely to occur. When these two factors become progressively separated from each other and the process of self-interaction by activists loses its strength, disengagement can be expected. The argument is illustrated with life-history interviews of activists who have kept their strong commitment to a major organization of the Swiss solidarity movement, and others that, in contrast, have abandoned their involvement. The findings support the argument that the interplay of the structural positions of actors and the symbolic meanings of mobilization has a strong impact on commitment to social movements and hence on sustained participation or disengagement. In particular, the interviews show the importance of a sense of coherence and of a holistic view of one's personal life for keeping commitment over time. This calls for a view of individual participation in social movements that draws from social phenomenology and symbolic interactionism in order to shed light on the symbolic (subjective) dimensions of participation,yet without neglecting the crucial role played by <b>structural</b> (<b>objective)</b> factors...|$|E

The main working hypothesis was tested that the best {{quality of life}} is found among emigrants living in Montreal. The research also explicated the historical connection between policies of migration and housing concerns in Canada and in Italy. Quality of life was measured using a battery of <b>structural,</b> <b>objective</b> and subjective indicators that were calibrated for relative comparisons between the two cities of destination by the re-analysis of two large surveys (Milano n = 966; Montreal n = 461), and by the use of of official statistics.

The objective indicators based on the ratios of income to need and those based on income relative to each city, are most influential in Montreal. Subjective indicators such as attitudes and lifestyles are more consistently related to levels of education than to place of residence.

40|$|Ausgehend von Jürgen Zinneckers Darstellung "Selbstsozialisation - Essay über ein aktuelles Konzept" (ZSE 3 / 00) zielt der Beitrag auf die grundlagentheoretische Debatte in der Sozialisationsforschung. Es wird aufgezeigt, dass das Programm der Selbstsozialisation nicht die beanspruchte Rolle bei der Reformulierung der Sozialisationsforschung spielen kann. Das Konzept der Selbstsozialisation zentriert die Sozialisationsforschung auf die Perspektive des Subjekts und vernachlässigt die Analyse struktureller Bedingungen der Sozialisation. Dieser "strukturlose Subjektzentrismus" kann rückblickend als ein Hauptcharakteristikum sozialisationstheoretischer Erklärungsansätze der vergangenen zwei Jahrzehnte angesehen werden. Das {{normative}} Subjektverständnis (das Postulat individueller Handlungsautonomie) und der Einfluss der Individualisierungsthese (die analytische Auflösung sozialer Strukturen) erfüllen jedoch nichtjene Kriterien, die an eine umfassende Theorie der Sozialisation angelegt werden müssen. Daher wird abschließend, auf Grundlage der Habitustheorie Pierre Bourdieus, die Vermittlung einer Subjekt- undstrukturtheoretischen Perspektive als eine erneuerte erkenntnisleitende Heuristik in der Sozialisationsforschung vorgestellt. (DIPF/Orig.) Refering to Jürgen Zinnecker 2 ̆ 7 s contribution " Selfsocialisation - EssayAbout a Current Theoretical Debate" (ZSE 3 / 00) {{the present}} article aims at a crucial theoretical debate in socialization research. It is shown {{that the concept of}} self socialization fails to fulfil its postulated role in reformulating theory of socialization since socialization research is restricted to a mere subjectivism and <b>structural</b> (<b>objective)</b> conditions of developmental and socialization processes are neglected. Looking back on the last two decades particularly within the German discussion the diagnosis of the outlined and as "structure less subjectivism " defined paradigm is also applicable to mainstream socialization theory. As consequence, a normative comprehension of subjectivity (pure autonomy of the individual) and the impact of individualization thesis (eliminating an understanding of social structure in contemporary social science) do not comply with the requirements of a comprehensive socialization theory. Based on Pierre Bourdieu 2 ̆ 7 s habitus theory the author finally presents a synthesis of structural approach and theory of actor that in conclusion may contribute to a reevaluation of socialization theory and to further empirical research.

40|$|International audienceThe {{field of}} {{topology}} optimization seeks to optimize shapes under <b>structural</b> <b>objectives,</b> such as achieving the most rigid shape using a given quantity of material. Besides optimal shape design, these methods are increasingly popular as design tools, since they automatically produce structures having desirable physical properties, a task hard to perform by hand even for skilled designers. However, {{there is no}} simple way to control {{the appearance of the}} generated objects. In this paper, we propose to optimize shapes for both their structural properties and their appearance, the latter being controlled by a user-provided pattern example. These two objectives are challenging to combine, as optimal structural properties fully define the shape, leaving no degrees of freedom for appearance. We propose a new formulation where appearance is optimized as an <b>objective</b> while <b>structural</b> properties serve as constraints. This produces shapes with sufficient rigidity while allowing enough freedom for the appearance of the final structure to resemble the input exemplar. Our approach generates rigid shapes using a specified quantity of material while observing optional constraints such as voids, fills, attachment points, and external forces. The appearance is defined by examples, making our technique accessible to casual users. We demonstrate its use in the context of fabrication using a laser cutter to manufacture real objects from optimized shapes...|$|R
40|$|Principal stress-lines are {{pairs of}} {{orthogonal}} curves that indicate trajectories of internal forces. Subsequently, these curves idealize paths of material continuity, and naturally encode the optimal topology for any structure {{for a given}} set of boundary conditions. Stress-line analysis {{has the potential to}} offer a direct and geometrically-provocative approach to optimization that can synthesize both design and <b>structural</b> <b>objectives.</b> However, its application in design has generally been limited {{due to a lack of}} standardization and parameterization of the process for generating and interpreting stress lines. Addressing these barriers, this thesis proposes a new implementation framework that enables designers to take advantage of stress-line analysis to inform conceptual structural design. Central to the premise of this research is a new conception of structurally-inspired design exploration that does not impose a singular solution, but instead allows for the exploration of a diverse high-performance design space in order to balance the combination of structural and architectural design objectives. Specifically, the thesis has immediate application for the topological design of both regular and irregular thin shell structures predominately subjected to in-plane and compressive structural actions. by Kam-Ming Mark Tam.

40|$|International audienceThe {{challenge}} of seismic exploration in fold and thrust belt settings is {{to optimize the}} depth seismic images of the deep <b>structural</b> <b>objectives</b> beneath a complex overburden that may show strong horizontal and vertical velocity variations. In such areas, the seismic image is frequently of poor quality and the depth models of deep layers is often false due to the perturbed propagation of seismic energy through the deforming lens of the overlying layers. A range of seismic processing tools, including post-stack and pre-stack depth migrations, are appropriate to predict the accurate geometry of deep target structures and to improve {{the building of a}} depth structural model. A strong combination of geological reasoning and depth seismic imaging processing can improve the understanding of the deep geological structures by reducing the uncertainties in depth geometrical and velocity model estimation.

40|$|Geometric patterns, pioneered {{centuries ago}} as a {{dominant}} form of ornamentation in Islamic architecture, represent an abundant source of possible topologies and geometries that can be explored in the preliminary design of discrete structures. This diverse design space motivates the coupling between Islamic patterns and the form finding of funicular grid shells for which structural performance is highly affected by topology and geometry. This thesis examines one such pattern through a parametric, performance-driven framework {{in the context of}} conceptual design, when many alternatives are being considered. Form finding is conducted via the force density method, which is augmented {{with the addition of a}} force density optimization loop to enable grid shell height selection. A further modification allows for force densities to be scaled according to the initial member lengths, introducing sensitivity to pattern geometry in the final form-found structures. The results attest to the viable synergy between architectural and <b>structural</b> <b>objectives</b> through grid shells that perform as well as, or better than, quadrilateral grid shells. Historic and cultural patterns therefore present design opportunities that both expand the conventional grid shell design vocabulary and offer designers an alternative means of referencing vernacular traditions in the modern built environment, through a structural engineering lens.
