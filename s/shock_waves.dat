5|$|Even in {{the absence}} of an impact, {{significant}} acceleration or deceleration of the head can cause TBI; however in most cases a combination of impact and acceleration is probably to blame. Forces involving the head striking or being struck by something, termed contact or impact loading, are the cause of most focal injuries, and movement of the brain within the skull, termed noncontact or inertial loading, usually causes diffuse injuries. The violent shaking of an infant that causes shaken baby syndrome commonly manifests as diffuse injury. In impact loading, the force sends <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> through the skull and brain, resulting in tissue damage. <b>Shock</b> <b>waves</b> caused by penetrating injuries can also destroy tissue along the path of a projectile, compounding the damage caused by the missile itself.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann made {{fundamental}} {{contributions in}} exploration {{of problems in}} numerical hydrodynamics. For example, with Robert D. Richtmyer he developed an algorithm defining artificial viscosity that improved the understanding of <b>shock</b> <b>waves.</b> When computers solved hydrodynamic or aerodynamic problems, they tried to put too many computational grid points at regions of sharp discontinuity (<b>shock</b> <b>waves).</b> The mathematics of artificial viscosity smoothed the shock transition without sacrificing basic physics. Other contributions to fluid dynamics included the classic flow solution to blast waves, and the co-discovery of the ZND detonation model of explosives. During the 1930s, Von Neumann became an authority on the mathematics of shaped charges.|$|E
5|$|Iridium {{is used in}} {{particle}} physics {{for the production of}} antiprotons, a form of antimatter. Antiprotons are made by shooting a high-intensity proton beam at a conversion target, which needs to be made from a very high density material. Although tungsten may be used instead, iridium has the advantage of better stability under the <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> induced by the temperature rise due to the incident beam.|$|E

The energy was according to the theory calculated from known <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> velocity, <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> position and <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> pressure-time profile at the defined position. Method of characteristic in the Kirkwood – Bethe modification was used for the calculation of the <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> pressure time profile.

Numerical results are given for a two-dimensional circular diffuser. The subsequent <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> motion is classified into a stable oscillation about the initial steady flow shock position and an unstable case where the <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> moves upstream of the throat, depending on {{the frequency of the}} pressure disturbance, the initial shock position, and the diffuser efficiency of the subsonic region downstream of the <b>shock</b> <b>wave.</b> The stability criterion of the <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> is shown with example calculations...|$|R
5000|$|The {{stalling}} of the <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> {{represents the}} supernova problem, because once stalled, the <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> {{should not be}} [...] "reenergized". The prompt convection model states that the <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> will increase the luminosity of the neutrinos produced by the core collapse, and this increase in energy will start the <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> going again. The neutron fingers model has instability near the core expel another wave of energized neutrinos which reenergizes the <b>shock</b> <b>wave.</b> The entropy convection model has matter falling inward from above the shock layer down to the gain radius, which would not increase neutrino luminosity, but would allow the <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> to continue outwards.|$|R

Many show signs of being subjected to high pressure <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> that are generated during impact events. Some of the returned samples are of impact melt (materials melted near an impact crater.)

The supernova then devolves {{into a black}} hole, where Arrow falls. The burst of <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> and maximum engine power enable Amelia to pilot the ship to safety. Amelia mourns the loss of Arrow, and suspects Jim of failing to secure the lifelines, while in fact Arrow's line was cut by a ruthless insectoid crew member named Scroop.|$|E

40|$|Understanding of the {{three-dimensional}} shock wave-vortex loop interaction phenomena {{plays a key}} role in noise reduction. This study focuses on {{the three-dimensional}} <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> distortion and propagation phenomena in a near-field supersonic jet. Shock-square vortex loop interaction was experimentally investigated in a square cross-sectional open-end <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> generating tube at an incident shock Mach number of 1. 39  ±  0. 05. A square vortex loop impinged on a reflected <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> from a wall located in front of the nozzle end. The planar reflected <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> transforms into either a concave or convex distorted shape due to the opposing high-speed flow emitted from the nozzle corner. The convex shaped <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> scatters towards the outside of the vortex loop, whereas the concave one converges towards the centre of the vortex loop. The concave shaped <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> results in <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> focusing. In shock-square vortex loop interaction, the <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> is locally focused along the axis of the nozzle corner...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Shock</b> <b>wave</b> {{parameters}} of cabins for shipboard defensive structure are studied based on <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> theory. The destroy of defensive structure {{can be estimated}} by impulse of <b>shock</b> <b>wave.</b> In the process of air <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> propagating, isentropic suction wave is reflected from void cabin into defense structure. The solution of <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> attenuation of void cabin {{can be reached by}} using isentropic line to replace the shock adiabatic of the reflected shock.

5|$|Infrared {{emission}} {{also reveals}} {{the presence of}} un-ionised material such as molecular hydrogen (H2) and argon. In many planetary nebulae, molecular emission is greatest at larger distances from the star, where more material is un-ionised, but molecular hydrogen emission in NGC 6543 seems to be bright at the inner edge of its outer halo. This {{may be due to}} <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> exciting the H2 as ejecta moving at different speeds collide. The overall appearance of the Cat's Eye Nebula in infrared (wavelengths 2–8μm) is similar in visible light.|$|E
5|$|Reynolds {{received}} his PhD in physics from Princeton in 1943, writing a thesis of {{the propagation of}} <b>shock</b> <b>waves.</b> During World War II, he joined the United States Navy, and served with the Manhattan Project.

5|$|The RaLa Experiment, or RaLa, was {{a series}} of tests during and after the Manhattan Project {{designed}} to study the behavior of converging <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> to achieve the spherical implosion necessary for compression of the plutonium pit of the nuclear weapon. The experiment used significant amounts of a short-lived radioisotope lanthanum-140, a potent source of gamma radiation; the RaLa is a contraction of Radioactive Lanthanum. The method was proposed by Robert Serber and developed by a team led by the Italian experimental physicist Bruno Rossi.|$|E
50|$|An oblique <b>shock</b> <b>wave,</b> {{unlike a}} normal shock, is {{inclined}} {{with respect to}} the incident upstream flow direction. It will occur when a supersonic flow encounters a corner that effectively turns the flow into itself and compresses. The upstream streamlines are uniformly deflected after the <b>shock</b> <b>wave.</b> The most common way to produce an oblique <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> is to place a wedge into supersonic, compressible flow. Similar to a normal <b>shock</b> <b>wave,</b> the oblique <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> consists of a very thin region across which nearly discontinuous changes in the thermodynamic properties of a gas occur. While the upstream and downstream flow directions are unchanged across a normal shock, they are different for flow across an oblique <b>shock</b> <b>wave.</b>|$|R

First bubble pulse profile was also precisely measured by pressure gauge using fluoropolymer. The experimental results shows that the late energy release by aluminum reaction in detonation products enhanced both <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> and first bubble pulse. It is demonstrated that the impulse of first bubble pulse is about 2. 5 times greater than <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> impulse, although peak pressure of first bubble pulse is only 10 ~ 15 % of peak <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> pressure...|$|R
5|$|About an {{hour after}} {{fragment}} K entered Jupiter, observers recorded auroral emission near the impact region, {{as well as at}} the antipode of the impact site with respect to Jupiter's strong magnetic field. The cause of these emissions was difficult to establish due to a lack of knowledge of Jupiter's internal magnetic field and of the geometry of the impact sites. One possible explanation was that upwardly accelerating <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> from the impact accelerated charged particles enough to cause auroral emission, a phenomenon more typically associated with fast-moving solar wind particles striking a planetary atmosphere near a magnetic pole.|$|E
5|$|After the 1918 {{enactment}} of the Representation of the People Act, allowing women over age30 to vote, Singh joined the Suffragette Fellowship and remained a member until her death.

In September 1919 Singh hosted the Indian soldiers of the peace contingent at Faraday House. Five years later, she made her second visit to India with Bamba and Colonel Sutherland. Singh visited Kashmir, Lahore, Amritsar, and Murre, where they were mobbed by crowds who came to see their former maharaja's daughters, and this visit boosted the cause of female suffrage in India.

However, the shape of the diffracting <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> except near the wall were similar in spite that the corner radius changes.

40|$|In recent years, {{the food}} self-support rate of Japan is 40 %, and this value {{is the lowest}} level in major {{developed}} countries. This reason includes decreasing of diverting rice consumption in Japan and increasing abandonment of cultivation. Therefore, these problems are solved by using rice powder instead of expensive flour, and we manage to increase the food selfsupport rate. Previously, the rice powder is manufactured by two methods. One is dry type, {{and the other is}} wet type. The former is the method getting rice powder by running dried rice to rotating metal, and has a problem which that starch is damaged by heat when processing was performed. The latter is performed same method against wet rice, and has a problem which a large quantity of water is used. As a method to solve these problems, an underwater <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> is used. <b>Shock</b> <b>wave</b> is the pressure wave which is over speed of sound by discharging high energy in short time. Propagating <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> in water is underwater <b>shock</b> <b>wave.</b> The characters of underwater <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> are long duration of <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> because water density is uniform, water is low price and easy to get and not heat processing. Thinking of industrialization, the electric discharge is used as the generating source of underwater <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> in the experiment. As the results, the efficiency of obtaining enough grain size, 100 ìm, of rice powder was too bad only using the simple processing using underwater <b>shock</b> <b>wave.</b> Therefore, in Okinawa National College of Technology collaborating with us, obtaining rice powder with higher efficiency by using converged underwater <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> is the goal of this research. In this research, the underwater <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> with equal energy of the experimental device of underwater <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> is measured by the optical observation.

5|$|This {{appeared}} {{to offer a}} solution {{to one of the}} most vexing problems of the era, designing an aircraft that was effective at subsonic and supersonic speeds. Subsonic lift is created by the airflow around the wing following streamlines, but supersonic lift is generated by <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> at points of critical curvature. No single design could offer high performance for both regimes. The blown disk could attack this problem by being laid out for supersonic performance only, and then using jet thrust to modify subsonic airflow into a semblance of a normal wing. The resulting design would be tuned for high supersonic performance, have reasonable subsonic performance, and would also offer VTOL, all in a single design.|$|E
