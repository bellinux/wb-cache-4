40|$|Electrostatically {{actuated}} {{radio frequency}} microelectromechanical systems (RF-MEMS) generally consist of microcantilevers and clamped-clamped microbeams. The presence of residual stress in these microstructures affects the static and dynamic {{behavior of the}} device. In this study, nonlinear finite element method (FEM) modeling and the experimental validation of residual stress induced in the clamped-clamped microbeams and the symmetric toggle RF-MEMS switch (STS) is presented. The formation of residual stress due to plastic deformation during the thermal loading-unloading cycle in the plasma etching step of the microfabrication process is explained and modeled using the Bauschinger effect. The difference between the designed and the measured natural frequency and pull-in voltage values for the clamped-clamped microbeams is explained {{by the presence of}} the nonhomogenous tensile residual stress. For the <b>STS</b> <b>switch</b> specimens, three-dimensional (3 D) FEM models are developed and the initial deflection at zero bias voltage, observed during the optical profile measurements, is explained by the residual stress developed during the plasma etching step. The simulated residual stress due to the plastic deformation is included in the STS models to obtain the switch pull-in voltage. At the end of the simulation process, a good correspondence is obtained between the FEM model results and the experimental measurements for both the clamped-clamped microbeams and the <b>STS</b> <b>switch</b> specimens...|$|E
30|$|The PT {{continuously}} broadcasts {{radio signals}} within its coverage area to transfer information to PRs. PRs receive these broadcast signals using their RF communication interface. Furthermore, PRs concurrently report CSI between PT and PR to STs located nearby, using their backscatter interface. Those STs that {{will receive the}} CSI from a PR are considered as its nearby STs. Based on the information received from the PR, nearby STs estimate the interference that may be induced to the PR. This estimated interference is then used by the STs to select either harvest-then-transmit mode or backscatter mode. It {{should be noted that}} STs cannot operate on harvest-then-transmit mode and backscatter mode simultaneously [5]. Therefore, <b>STs</b> <b>switch</b> between one of the two modes to transfer their information to SRs. To receive useful information from STs, SRs may tune to either RF communication or backscatter communication, depending upon the communication mode used by STs.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the Design of Experiments (DOE) based parametric design optimization of the Symmetric Toggle RF-MEMS Switch (STS) for minimizing the actuation voltage considering the fabrication process uncertainties and thermally induced residual stress. Initially, three-dimensional (3 D) non-linear Finite Element Method (FEM) models are developed {{and the formation}} of residual stress during the plasma etching step of the microfabrication process is explained using the Bauschinger effect. The pull-in voltage values and the switch profiles obtained after the thermal loading-unloading cycle in the FEM models are compared with the experimental values and optical profile measurements which showed a close agreement. A DOE based Dual Response Surface Methodology (DRSM) is implemented to identify the significant design parameters affecting the <b>STS</b> <b>switch</b> pull-in voltage in the presence of thermally induced residual stress. Two separate response surface empirical models are developed; one for the mean pull-in voltage and other for variation in the pull-in voltage due to microfabrication process tolerances. The developed response surface models are optimized simultaneously using the desirability function approach. The optimal levels of the design parameters that result in minimum pull-in voltage with increased insensitivity to process uncertainties are obtained using the direct search algorithm...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{show that}} Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) aging of sleep {{transistors}} (STs), together with its detrimental effect for circuit performance and lifetime, presents considerable benefits for power gated circuits. Indeed, it reduces static power due to leakage current, and increases <b>ST</b> <b>switch</b> efficiency, making power gating more efficient and effective over time. The magnitude of these aging benefits depends on operating and environmental conditions. By means of HSPICE simulations, considering a 32 nm CMOS technology, we demonstrate that static power may reduce by more than 80 % in 10 years of operation. Static power decrease over time due to NBTI aging is also proven experimentally, using a test-chip manufactured with a TSMC 65 nm technology. We propose an ST design strategy for reliable power gating, in order to harvest the benefits offered by NBTI aging. It relies {{on the design of}} STs with a proper lower Vth compared to the standard power switching fabric. This can be achieved by either re-designing the STs with the identified Vth value, or applying a proper forward body bias to the available power switching fabrics. Through HSPICE simulations, we show lifetime extension up to 21. 4 X and average static power reduction up to 16. 3 % compared to standard ST design approach, without additional area overhead. Finally, we show lifetime extension and several performance-cost trade-offs when a target maximum lifetime is considered...|$|R
