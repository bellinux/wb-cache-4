40|$|Coherent {{parity check}} (<b>CPC)</b> <b>codes</b> {{are a new}} {{framework}} {{for the construction of}} quantum error correction codes that encode multiple qubits per logical block. In this paper, we provide a detailed introduction to <b>CPC</b> <b>codes</b> using conventional quantum circuit notation. We demonstrate that syndrome information from a full encode-decode cycle of a [[4, 2, 2]] <b>CPC</b> <b>code</b> on the IBM 5 Q superconducting quantum computer can be used to increase state fidelity by post-selection. We then generalise <b>CPC</b> <b>codes</b> to other quantum technologies by showing that their structure allows them to be efficiently compiled using any experimentally realistic native two-qubit gate. We introduce a three-stage CPC design process for the construction of hardware-optimised quantum memories. As a proof-of-concept example, we apply our design process to an idealised linear seven-qubit ion trap. In the first stage of the process, we use exhaustive search methods to find a large set of [[7, 3, 3]] codes that saturate the quantum Hamming bound for seven qubits. We then optimise over the discovered set of codes to meet the hardware and layout demands of the ion trap device. The quantum error correction codes presented in this paper are suitable for deployment on current ion trap hardware. We also discuss how the CPC design process will generalise to larger-scale codes and other qubit technologies. Comment: 40 pages including appendices. 23 figures.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a high-level graphical {{framework for the}} design, analysis, and verification of quantum error correcting codes. The coherent parity check construction for stabilizer codes allows us to construct {{a broad range of}} quantum codes based on classical codes, and gives a framework in which large classes of such codes can be both analytically and numerically discovered. Using graphical tools based on the calculus, we explicitly construct small distance 3 and 5 codes with high code rates using this framework. We also show how this framework can be used to represent CSS codes and conversely how to compute stabilisers for a <b>CPC</b> <b>code.</b> We give a construction turns (almost) any pair of classical [n,k, 3] codes into a [[2 n - k + 2, k, 3]] <b>CPC</b> <b>code,</b> and give a straightforward technique for machine search which yields thousands of potential codes, and demonstrate its operation for distance 3 and 5 codes. Finally we use the graphical tools we introduce to demonstrate how Clifford computation can be performed within <b>CPC</b> <b>codes.</b> Comment: 64 pages, 31 figures, minor updates to add an author and fix a crucial typo in V 2.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{software}} package {{designed to reduce}} the computational burden of hadron collider measurements in Parton Distribution Function (PDF) fits. The APFELgrid package converts interpolated weight tables provided by APPLgrid files into a more efficient format for PDF fitting by the combination with PDF and α_s evolution factors provided by APFEL. This combination significantly reduces the number of operations required to perform the calculation of hadronic observables in PDF fits and simplifies {{the structure of the}} calculation into a readily optimised scalar product. We demonstrate that our technique can lead to a substantial speed improvement when compared to existing methods without any reduction in numerical accuracy. Comment: 13 pages, 2 figures.
