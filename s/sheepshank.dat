5|$|Pathfinder : This is {{the first}} real {{advancement}} badge. It focuses on basic Scout training, including the six basic knots (Reef Knot, Bowline, Sheet bend, <b>Sheepshank,</b> Figure-of-eight, and Clove hitch), basic first aid (treatment of open wounds and bleeding), and introduces Scouts to camping. The badge encourages a Scout to participate in patrol activities. The Scout is required to have camped away from their normal Scout meeting place {{for at least five}} nights.|$|E

60|$|The heavy weeks dragged slowly by, and {{a one-sided}} {{correspondence}} is like posting letters into a dream. My progress with Miss Austen was slow, because {{she made me}} think and argue with her. Apart from her, I devoured every fragment of print I could lay hands on. For when fiction palled I turned to facts, mastered the <b>sheepshank,</b> the running bowline, and the figure-of-eight; and wrestled on with my sea-craft. It was a hard task, and I thought it fair progress if in that I covered half a knot a day.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sheepshanks</b> {{was born}} in Leeds in 1794. She was the {{daughter}} of Joseph and Ann <b>Sheepshanks.</b> Her mother was from Kendal and her father was a cloth manufacturer. Her brothers were John and Richard <b>Sheepshanks.</b> In 1819 her brother Richard returned from being tenth wrangler and after obtaining his masters degree at Trinity College, Cambridge. <b>Sheepshanks</b> went to live with him. When he died unmarried in Reading in 1855 she was his heir. She gave 196 books from her brothers book collection to the Royal Astronomical Society.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. <b>Sheepshanks</b> harked back. [...] "I am {{a married}} man, and--d'ye see?--Mrs. <b>Sheepshanks,</b> {{as you might}} say, has no sympathy with ballooning. She was a Guthrie of Dumfries." ...|$|R
50|$|This {{version of}} the <b>sheepshank</b> is tied by using slipknots instead of half-hitches. It {{is one of the}} safest <b>sheepshank</b> variations.|$|E
50|$|The man-o'war <b>sheepshank</b> is a <b>sheepshank</b> knot with a Handcuff knot in the middle. This {{configuration}} {{with the}} half-hitches formed {{close to the}} central knot is used in rope rescue and is called a Fireman's chair knot.|$|E
50|$|A shank {{is a type}} of knot that is used {{to shorten}} a rope or take up slack, such as the <b>sheepshank.</b> The <b>sheepshank</b> knot is not stable. It will fall apart under too much load or too little load.|$|E
6000|$|... "They still leave <b>Sheepshanks</b> to be {{accounted}} for." [...] Byfield began to irritate me. I {{turned to the}} stowaway. [...] "Perhaps," [...] said I, [...] "Mr. <b>Sheepshanks</b> will explain." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Sheepshanks</b> {{collected}} pictures, {{mainly by}} British artists, and in 1857 presented his notable collection to the nation. These {{are at the}} Victoria & Albert Museum, London, which no longer observes all the conditions which he attached to the gift. He retired from business in 1833 and died a bachelor in 1863. His sister and brother were Anne <b>Sheepshanks</b> and Richard <b>Sheepshanks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sheepshanks</b> gave £10,000 to the Cambridge Observatory. This {{fund was}} used to {{purchase}} a modern photographic telescope at the observatory, which was named in her honour, and also to establish the <b>Sheepshanks</b> Exhibition. [...] She became an honorary member of the Royal Astronomical Society. The crater <b>Sheepshanks</b> on the Moon is also named after her, {{one of the few}} lunar craters with a female eponym.|$|R
5000|$|An {{alternative}} method for quickly constructing a <b>sheepshank</b> is as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Sheepshank</b> knots are {{typically}} used for securing loads to trucks or trailers, and in sailing applications.|$|E
50|$|The kamikaze knot is {{a slight}} variant of the <b>sheepshank.</b> To perform a kamikaze knot, a <b>sheepshank</b> is first constructed. Whilst holding {{sufficient}} tension on the <b>sheepshank</b> so it will not slip out, the middle rope is sliced. This allows climbers rappelling down cliff faces to keep most of the rope used for the rappel, by tying the knot at the top, and shaking the rope when they reach the bottom. The shaking disconnects the knot at the top, allowing the longer section of rope to fall, meaning {{only a small amount}} of rope is retained by the anchor {{at the top of the}} cliff. Thin or slippery rope is unsuitable for such a knot, as it can easily slip, and the knot should not be performed unless desperately needed.|$|E
5000|$|Born on 23 February 1834 in Belgravia, London to Thomas <b>Sheepshanks</b> (1796-1875), rector of St John's, Coventry and his wife, Katherine (née Smith 1804 or 1805-1869). <b>Sheepshanks</b> {{was educated}} at Coventry Grammar School, then at Christ's College, Cambridge.|$|R
5000|$|Ernest Richard <b>Sheepshanks,</b> {{also known}} as Dick <b>Sheepshanks,</b> (22 March 1910 [...] - [...] 31 December 1937) was an English amateur {{first-class}} cricketer, who played one match for Yorkshire County Cricket Club in 1929, and was a war correspondent, {{who was killed in}} the Spanish Civil War.|$|R

5000|$|Although {{certainly}} not invented by him this {{variant of the}} <b>sheepshank</b> knot appeared in an episode of the TV show Man Vs Wild. Bear Grylls uses a modification of this knot by cutting one of the lengths of rope in the knot, while rappelling down an edge during the Ireland episode of Man vs. Wild in order to retrieve his rope at the bottom by severing the middle leg of the <b>sheepshank</b> knot before his descent. He refers {{to it as a}} [...] "Kamikaze" [...] knot.|$|E
5000|$|Demonstrate with rope how {{to tie a}} (1) Reef Knot, (2) <b>Sheepshank,</b> (3) Clove Hitch, (4) Round Turn and Two Half Hitches, (5) Bowline, {{and explain}} their uses.|$|E
50|$|Knots of {{more recent}} origin include the {{friendship}} knot of Chinese knotting. The <b>sheepshank</b> knot originates from 1627 while the Western Union splice originates {{from the beginning}} of telegraphy.|$|E

50|$|The catshank is {{a variant}} of the <b>sheepshank,</b> {{clinched}} by two overhand knots with the bights passed through the twists (one end of the rope must be available to tie the overhands).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>sheepshank</b> was {{developed}} before {{the use of}} modern [...] "slippery" [...] synthetic ropes. Constructed from such ropes, under load, it can fail. It is strongly advised that an alternative knot be used.|$|E
50|$|A Police {{task force}} {{operation}} <b>sheepshank</b> began after a report was compiled on an alleged paedophile ring at the Aboriginal community of Kalumburu, in the Kimberley resulting in arrests of {{three men and}} a juvenile from Oombulgurri.|$|E

50|$|In December 1937, {{during the}} Battle of Teruel, a Republican shell hit {{just in front}} of the car in which Philby was {{travelling}} with the correspondents Edward J. Neil of the Associated Press, Bradish Johnson of Newsweek, and Ernest <b>Sheepshanks</b> of Reuters. Johnson was killed outright, and Neil and <b>Sheepshanks</b> soon died of their injuries. Philby suffered only a minor head wound.|$|R
50|$|He married Eleanor Louisa Henry, the illegitimate {{daughter}} of the English astronomer Richard <b>Sheepshanks</b> (1794-1855).|$|R
50|$|The dogshank is {{a variant}} of the <b>sheepshank,</b> where the eyes formed at each end have the ends of the rope passed through them to prevent the knot from spilling. At least one end of the rope must be available.|$|E
5000|$|This {{version of}} the knot uses a sheepshank-like construction, {{in this kind of}} {{application}} also known as a bell ringer's knot, to form the loop. It is quicker to make than a fixed loop, but is less dependable. [...] It is avoided in critical applications (such as securing a load on a truck) as it can fall apart under too little load or too much load, and can capsize if not dressed properly. [...] However, this knot may be made secure by adding a Half Hitch by using the top bight of the <b>Sheepshank.</b> This form of the trucker's hitch is least likely to jam, coming apart easily once tension is released. Different sources show slight variations in the way the <b>sheepshank</b> portion is formed and dressed.|$|E
5000|$|As a {{teenager}} Randolph {{fell in love}} with Diana Mitford, sister of his friend Tom Mitford. Tom Mitford was regarded as having a calming influence on him, although his housemaster Colonel <b>Sheepshank</b> wrongly suspected them of being lovers; Randolph replied [...] "I happen to be in love with his sister".|$|E
6000|$|... "Hear, hear! Silence! 'His name is <b>Sheepshanks.</b> On the Grampian Hills {{his father}} kept his flocks--a {{thousand}} sheep,' and, I make no doubt, shanks in proportion. Excuse you, <b>Sheepshanks?</b> My dear sir! At this altitude one shank {{was more than}} we {{had a right to}} expect: the plural multiplies the obligation." [...] Keeping a tight hold on his hysteria, Dalmahoy steadied himself by a rope and bowed.|$|R
50|$|Richard <b>Sheepshanks</b> (30 July 1794, in Leeds - 4 August 1855, in Reading) was an English astronomer.|$|R
6000|$|Byfield {{produced}} {{from one of}} the lockers a pork pie and a bottle of sherry (the viaticum in choice and assortment almost explained the man) and we sat down to the repast. Dalmahoy's tongue ran like a brook. He addressed Mr. <b>Sheepshanks</b> with light-hearted impartiality as Philip's royal son, as the Man of Ross, as the divine Clarinda. He elected him Professor of Marital Diplomacy to the University of Cramond. He passed the bottle and called on him for a toast, a song--"Oblige me, <b>Sheepshanks,</b> by making the welkin ring." [...] Mr. <b>Sheepshanks</b> beamed, and gave us a sentiment instead. The little man was enjoying himself amazingly. [...] "Fund of spirits your friend has, to be sure, sir--quite a fund." ...|$|R
