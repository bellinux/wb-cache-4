5|$|Like <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>else,</b> {{this is hard}} to say, but {{the balance}} of historians' judgements is that there {{may well have been}} bishops based in Llanbadarn for a period, or even periods, in Celtic times. Church {{organisation}} in early medieval (pre-1100) Wales was flexible, and there were no fixed dioceses. The claim in Padarn's Life that he was bishop of Ceredigion reflects a tradition, but the actual area of the saint's influence was in north Ceredigion and what is now Radnorshire (mid-Powys). Ceredigion south of the river Wyre was David country. Some time after this the church is said to have lost its episcopal privileges. The church is thought to have been annexed, after the dissolution of the see, to that of St David's; although as with much of the early history this is uncertain. Bishops at this time were, in Wales, rather more itinerant than they later became, and diocesan boundaries much more fluid than they were later. Gerald of Wales (Gerald de Barri, better known as Giraldus Cambrensis), reported that he had been told that the bishopric had been lost because at some time past Llanbadarn's bishop had been murdered and the church lands appropriated by his killers, the forerunners of the clas which held the church {{at the time of his}} visit in 1188.|$|E
500|$|The nudity was {{optional}} for the performers. The French cast was [...] "the nudest" [...] of {{the foreign}} groups, while the London cast [...] "found nudity the hardest to achieve." [...] The Swedish cast was reluctant to disrobe, but in Copenhagen, the tribe thought the nudity too tame and decided to walk naked {{up and down the}} aisle during the show's prelude. In some early performances, the Germans played their scene behind a big sheet labeled [...] "CENSORED". Original Broadway cast member Natalie Mosco said, [...] "I was dead set against the nude scene at first, but I remembered my acting teacher having said that part of acting is being private in public. So I did it." [...] According to Melba Moore, [...] "It doesn't mean anything except what you want it to mean. We put so much value on clothing. .... It's like <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>else</b> people get uptight about." [...] Donna Summer, who was in the German production, said that [...] "it was not meant to be sexual. ... We stood naked to comment on the fact that society makes more of nudity than killing." [...] Rado said that [...] "being naked in front of an audience, you're baring your soul. [...] Not only the soul but the whole body was being exposed. It was very apt, very honest and almost necessary." ...|$|E

It was published on 7 October 2009, in German with a [...] "separate English translation along with Shamdasani's introduction and footnotes" [...] {{at the back}} of the book, according to Sara Corbett for The New York Times. She wrote, [...] "The book is bombastic, baroque and like <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>else</b> about Carl Jung, a willful oddity, synched with an antediluvian and mystical reality." ...|$|E

2500|$|USA Today {{comments}} that {{compared to other}} crime shows, the show [...] "is built on a more traditional and solid foundation: {{the strength of its}} characters" [...] and [...] "what sets Tuesday's Bones premiere apart from the procedural pack are stars Emily Deschanel and David Boreanaz, as the season's most appealing new crime fighters." [...] On the other hand, Media Life Magazine posited that while Bones has [...] "an amazingly clever notion, brilliant even", its [...] "execution doesn't match the conception" [...] and based on its first episode, the show [...] "fails to evolve into a gripping series. In fact, it quickly becomes so derivative of <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>else</b> on television — especially, strangely, X-Files — that one might even call it bone-headed." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{electric}} power systems, inductive reactance (and capacitive reactance, however inductive reactance is more common) can limit the power capacity of an AC transmission line, because {{power is not}} completely transferred when voltage and current are out-of-phase (detailed above). That is, current will flow for an out-of-phase system, however real power at certain times will not be transferred, {{because there will be}} points during which instantaneous current is positive while instantaneous voltage is negative, or vice versa, implying negative power transfer. Hence, real work is not performed when power transfer is “negative”. However, current still flows even when a system is out-of-phase, which causes transmission lines to heat up due to current flow. Consequently, transmission lines can only heat up <b>so</b> <b>much</b> (or <b>else</b> they would physically [...] "sag" [...] too <b>much),</b> <b>so</b> transmission line operators have a “ceiling” on the amount of current that can flow through a given line, and excessive inductive reactance can limit the power capacity of a line.|$|R

Anne, methinks I see the traces of tears. If you've been crying DO own up. It will restore my self-respect, for I was shedding tears freely before Ruby came along. I don't mind being a goose <b>so</b> <b>much</b> if somebody <b>else</b> is goosey, too. Cake? You'll give me a teeny piece, won't you? Thank you. It has the real Avonlea flavor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And what, after all, {{is the use}} {{of these}} wars?" [...] said she to herself [...] "What do they get by taking so many towns, and getting so many guns, and killing so many men? I don't know who's the better for it, but I know very well who's the worse. Why can't they let the blues alone; and the blues let them alone? I worked my poor fingers to the bone making a white flag before they went to Saumur, and all they did was to leave it in the streets of Nantes. There's not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as a bottle of beer, and hardly a bushel of flour left in Echanbroignes. There's the poor dear lovely Cathelineau dead and gone. There's M. Henri engaged to the girl of his heart, and he can't <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as stay a day from {{fighting}} to get himself married; and there's Jacques just as bad. If Jacques cares a bit for me, he must take himself off, and me with him, to some place where there's not quite <b>so</b> <b>much</b> fighting, or <b>else</b> I'll be quit of him and go without him. I've no idea of living in a place where girls are not, to be married till the wars are over. Wars, wars, wars; I'm sick of the wars with all my heart." ...|$|R
60|$|As to poor Ben Greenway, {{the good}} woman was greatly {{relieved}} {{that her son}} had not mentioned him, and she took care {{not to do it}} herself. She did not wish to strain her optimism. Kate, having <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>else</b> upon her mind, never thought of this good man.|$|E

60|$|It {{appeared}} that Manasomba {{was not a}} Man-gnaja, and that his suspicions were excited by anything so inexplicable to the negro mind as white men going about with <b>so</b> <b>much</b> cloth without buying slaves nor <b>much</b> of anything <b>else.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Yes;--I {{do think}} Ayala Dormer {{is a very}} pretty girl, and I [...] do think, also, that she is clever. I quite agree that she [...] is ladylike.

60|$|He {{knew that}} she was a Harpy. He knew that her soft words would only bring him to new grief. But yet he could not help himself.
