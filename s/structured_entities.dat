One important difference between these views is that on the Russellian account, two propositions that are true in all the same states of affairs can still be differentiated. For instance, the proposition that two plus two equals four is distinct on a Russellian account from three plus three equals six. If propositions are sets of possible worlds, however, then all mathematical truths (and all other necessary truths) are the same set (the set of all possible worlds).|$|E

40|$|I {{defend the}} Fregean model of propositions: propositions are (a) the referents of that-clauses and (b) <b>structured</b> <b>entities</b> made of concepts. Schiffer (2003) has {{presented}} {{a group of}} arguments against the Fregean model and advanced an alternative view: propositions are unstructured pleonastic entities. My purpose is twofold: (i) to counter each of his arguments sketching the guidelines for a theory of concepts as basic constituents of propositions; (ii) to maintain {{that the notion of}} pleonastic entity is not robust enough for claiming the existence of propositions. 1. Schiffer (2003 pp. 24 - 27) presents a group of arguments against the Fregean model of thatclauses. The Fregean model holds three main theses: (A) That-clauses are singular terms standing for propositions. (B) Propositions are <b>structured</b> <b>entities</b> determined by the referents of the expressions forming the that-clauses and by their syntactic structure. (C) Expressions occurring in that-clauses have concepts as referents.

40|$|Methods {{that measure}} {{compatibility}} between mention pairs are currently the dominant approach to coreference. However, they {{suffer from a}} number of drawbacks including difficulties scaling to large numbers of mentions and limited representational power. As the severity of these drawbacks continue to progress with the growing demand for more data, the need to replace the pairwise approaches with a more expressive, highly scalable alternative is becoming increasingly urgent. In this paper we propose a novel discriminative hierarchical model that recursively <b>structures</b> <b>entities</b> into trees. These trees succinctly summarize the mentions providing a highly-compact information-rich structure for reasoning about entities and coreference uncertainty at small, large, and massive scales. The unique recursive <b>structure</b> of our <b>entities</b> allows our model to adapt to entities of various sizes, express features over entity hierarchies, and scale to massive data, making our approach a desirable new standard to replace the antiquated pairwise model. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{relationships}} and behavioral dependencies can be seen abstractly as associative knowledge amongst individuals of the same complexity. Conversely, part-whole knowledge defines the relationships and behavioral dependencies between individuals of different complexity, arranged in part-whole hierarchies. Most of the current modeling paradigms do not correlate the two kinds of knowledge. It can be argued, rather, that an ontological dependency exists between associative and part-whole knowledge. Complex <b>structured</b> <b>entities,</b> {{referred to in the}} paper as wholes, are then required to explicitly encapsulate associative knowledge, thus providing units of reuse and stability. The principle is applied to behavioral modeling in Statecharts, where entity synchronization represents the associative knowledge used to compose complex behaviors from simpler ones.

40|$|This work aims to {{parameterize}} {{the urban}} structure types (UST) in Santiago de Chile on statistical block level. In connotation of remote sensing UST {{are defined as}} land-use <b>structure</b> <b>entities.</b> Central input data for this object-oriented approach is spatially very high resolution panfused and atmospherically corrected Quickbird data. To analyse and assess the structural properties of urban land- cover objects within block level entities, basic and robust land-cover class descriptions are developed. For enhanced class descriptions several image object scales are created. Based on defined UST and additional field data a set of test areas is selected for four municipalities assigned to different socio-spatial clusters in Santiago de Chile. In all test areas {{the distribution of the}} basic land- cover classes is parameterized using complex sub-object and relational image object descriptions. The central features to characterise the UST in this study are percentage area and density of subscale land-cover class objects. To carry out this analysis, the expert knowledge on UST is valuable to choose specific reference objects within the statistical block level. After the concept is implemented at the smallest scale, the approach can successfully be applied to the whole municipality once specific structural information are aggregated. The work is linked to activities of the project Risk Habitat Megacity and developed in close cooperation with the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research – UFZ in Leipzig, Germany. Finally, the resulting land-use <b>structure</b> <b>entities</b> will be linked to socio-spatial characteristics in the above mentioned cluster with respect to urban vulnerability...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} speeding up Entity Recognition systems that exploit existing large databases of <b>structured</b> <b>entities</b> to improve extraction accuracy. These systems require the computation of the maximum similarity scores of several overlapping segments of the input text with the entity database. We formulate a Batch-Top-K problem {{with the goal of}} sharing computations across overlapping segments. Our proposed algorithm performs a factor of three faster than independent Top-K queries and only a factor of two slower than an unachievable lower bound on total cost. We then propose a novel modification of the popular Viterbi algorithm for recognizing entities so as to work with easily computable bounds on match scores, thereby reducing the total inference time by a factor of eight compared to stateof-the-art methods. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Many {{computational}} {{methods are}} based on the manipulation of entities with internal structure, such as objects, records, or data structures. Most conventional approaches based on neural networks have problems dealing with such <b>structured</b> <b>entities.</b> The algorithms presented in this paper represent a novel approach to neural-symbolic integration that allows for symbolic data in the form of objects to be translated to a scalar representation that can then be used by connectionist systems. We present the implementation of two translation algorithms that aid in performing object-oriented function approximation. We argue that objects provide an abstract representation of data that is well suited for the input and output of neural networks, as well as other statistical learning techniques. By examining the results of a simple sorting example, we illustrate the efficacy of these techniques. I...|$|E
