Traditional recipes call for three types of sausage: Morteau sausage or Montbéliard sausage, <b>Strasbourg</b> <b>sausage</b> and Frankfurt sausage. Fatty, inexpensive or salted cuts of pork also often form a part of choucroute garnie, including ham hocks, pork knuckles and shoulders, back bacon and slices of salt pork.
