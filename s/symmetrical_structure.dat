5|$|The hymn is {{probably}} {{best known as the}} basis for Bach's funeral motet of the same name, BWV 227. Scored for five vocal parts—two sopranos (S), alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)—Bach alternates the stanzas of the chorale and text from Paul's epistle to the Romans. Within an overall <b>symmetrical</b> <b>structure,</b> he varies his treatment of the verses of the hymn: stanzas 1 and 6 are the same simple four part setting; stanzas 2 and 4 are settings with the cantus firmus in the soprano and an expressive accompaniment in the lower three or four voices; stanza 5 is a chorale fantasia with the cantus firmus in the alto; and stanza 3 is freely composed with no connection to the hymn tune.|$|E
5|$|The text {{consists}} of different Bible {{passages from the}} Old and New Testament, {{as well as individual}} verses of hymns by Martin Luther and Adam Reusner, which all together refer to finiteness, preparation for death and dying. There are two distinct parts to the cantata: the view of the Old Testament on death shown in the first part is confronted by that of the New Testament in the second part, leading to a <b>symmetrical</b> <b>structure.</b> The juxtaposition of texts from the Old and New Testament appeared before in the Christliche Betschule (Christian school of prayer) by Johann Olearius. Markus Rathey, professor at the Yale Institute of Sacred Music, argued in 2006, that the sermon given at the funeral of Strecker is similar in ideas to the themes of the cantatas. It may be an indication that Bach composed the work for this occasion.|$|E
5|$|The {{text of the}} cantata {{is taken}} from a 1704 {{collection}} of librettos from Meiningen, many {{of which had been}} set to music in the cantatas of Bach's distant cousin Johann Ludwig Bach, Capellmeister at Meiningen. The librettos have been attributed to his employer Duke Ernst Ludwig von Sachsen-Meiningen. The <b>symmetrical</b> <b>structure</b> of seven movements is typical for this collection: the opening quotation from the Old Testament, followed by a recitative and an aria; then the central quotation from the New Testament, followed by an aria and a recitative, leading into the final chorale. The theme of BWV 39 is an invocation to be grateful for God's gifts and to share them with the needy.|$|E

5|$|By August30, strong outflow {{developed}} around Luis despite convection remaining {{displaced from}} the low pressure center. Once the shear began to relent, shower and thunderstorm activity redeveloped around the center, allowing the storm to intensify. Around 1800UTC that day, Luis attained Category1 hurricane status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale; however, operationally Luis was not upgraded to a hurricane until 0900UTC on August31. The newly upgraded hurricane steadily intensified as banding features developed around {{the periphery of the}} cyclone. By the morning of August31, cold cloud tops surrounded a developing eye. Around this time, Luis was located due south of the area of high pressure and tracking steadily towards the west-northwest. Further development resulted in the appearance of a ragged eye appearing on visible satellite images. Winds within the eyewall were estimated at 100mph (155km/h), making Luis a low-end Category2 hurricane. Later that day, the storm became increasingly organized, with a <b>symmetrical</b> <b>structure</b> and a well-defined center. The NHC forecast the hurricane to peak as a Category3 hurricane in 36hours before interacting with Hurricane Iris and Tropical Storm Karen.|$|E

40|$|Jane Austen' s Sense and Sensibility {{contains}} several <b>symmetrical</b> <b>structures</b> {{that we can}} analyse {{from the}} viewpoint of the story's shift of scenes at Norland Park, Barton Park, London and Cleveland. Each of these places shows a large-scale symmetry. In Norland Park, for example, John and Fanny Dashwood's money worship is countervailed by the sentimentalism of Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters. Barton Park is the place where the Middletons' carefree optimism is put in a sharp contrast to the Dashwoods' continual misgivings about their household economy. In London we find that the mammonism of Mrs. Ferrars and the Steele sisters torments the lovelorn hearts of Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. Although Cleveland does not necessarily show characters' symmetrical relations, it is chosen as the place for Marianne's overcoming her romantic sensitivity. <b>Symmetrical</b> <b>structures</b> are quite effective in delineating the characters' personalities and accelerating the plot towards its climax.
