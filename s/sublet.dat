5|$|During the 18th century, Stokesay Castle {{continued}} to be leased by the Baldwyn family, although they <b>sublet</b> the property {{to a range of}} tenants; after this point it ceased {{to be used as a}} domestic dwelling. Two wood and plaster buildings, built against the side of the hall, were demolished around 1800, and by the early 19th century the castle was being used for storing grain and manufacturing, including barrel-making, coining and a smithy.|$|E
5|$|Houses at Noel Park were {{deliberately}} {{designed to}} be relatively small, both for cheapness and to discourage tenants from taking on lodgers. Many of the larger houses at Shaftesbury Park had been <b>sublet</b> and split, and the practice went against {{the principles of the}} Artizans Company's founders. To discourage the practice at Queen's Park and Noel Park, cottage flats were built; these maintained the terraced façade, but split the house into upper and lower flats, each flat having a separate front door onto the street. Many properties, particularly on the central Gladstone Avenue, were built in this style; this maintained the unbroken façade of the first-class houses, but allowed large numbers of smaller and low-income families to be housed.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} {{for an interview}} with Splits Magazine, cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) demands that new cheerleader Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) lose ten pounds in a week. She reserves the school auditorium for cheer practice, so glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) has to find the club a new rehearsal space. He visits a local roller rink where he finds former glee club member April Rhodes (Kristin Chenoweth), who tells him that she is the mistress of the wealthy eighty-year-old tycoon who owns the rink. Upon learning that Will is looking to <b>sublet</b> his apartment, April invites herself to visit. After spending the night sharing a bed, Will forbids April from staying over again and tells her she is worth more than being a mistress. April says she will break up with her tycoon.|$|E

5|$|John Ebers, a bookseller, {{took over}} the {{management}} of the theatre in 1821, and seven more London premieres of Rossini operas (La gazza ladra, Il turco in Italia, Mosè in Egitto, Otello, La donna del lago, Matilde di Shabran and Ricciardo e Zoraide) took place there in the following three years. Ebers <b>sublet</b> the theatre to Giambattista Benelli in 1824, and Rossini was invited to conduct, remaining for a five-month season, with his wife Isabella Colbran performing. Two more of his operas, Zelmira and Semiramide, received their British premieres during the season, but the theatre sustained huge losses and Benelli absconded without paying either the composer or the artists. Ebers engaged Giuditta Pasta for the 1825 season, but he became involved in lawsuits which, combined with a large increase in the rent of the theatre, forced him into bankruptcy, after which he returned to his bookselling business.|$|E
5|$|The Trocadero sits in {{the area}} between Coventry Street, Great Windmill Street and Shaftesbury Avenue, with the main {{entrance}} on Coventry Street. The origins of the site {{can be traced back}} to 1744, when John Cartwright gave a 99-year lease on this land to Thomas Higginson, in order to construct a real tennis court. Higginson retained ownership of the court until 1761, after which it had a number of owners through to the 19th century. From the 1820s onwards, it was used as a music and exhibition hall. After the lease expired in 1842, ownership passed to John Musgrove, who <b>sublet</b> it to Robert Bignel. Bignel redesigned the premises as a number of assembly rooms called the Argyll Rooms. It acquired a notorious reputation for prostitution, and consequently closed in 1878. It re-opened four years later as the Trocadero Palace, a music hall. A group of shops were established on the site in 1889, and the entire development was sold to J. Lyon's & Co in 1895. Having been part of the Lyons restaurant complex and shops for much of the 20th century, it is now a shopping centre.|$|E

25|$|The Merovingians {{established}} {{themselves in}} the power vacuum of the former Roman provinces in Gaul, and Clovis I converted to Christianity following his victory over the Alemanni at the Battle of Tolbiac (496), laying {{the foundation of the}} Frankish Empire, the dominant state of early medieval Western Christendom. The Frankish kingdom grew through a complex development of conquest, patronage, and alliance building. Due to salic custom, inheritance rights were absolute, and all land was divided equally among the sons of a dead land holder. This meant that, when the king granted a prince land in reward for service, that prince and all of his descendants had an irrevocable right to that land that no future king could undo. Likewise, those princes (and their sons) could <b>sublet</b> their land to their own vassals, who could in turn <b>sublet</b> the land to lower sub-vassals. This all had the effect of weakening the power of the king as his kingdom grew, since the result was that the land became controlled by not just by more princes and vassals, but by multiple layers of vassals. This also allowed his nobles to attempt to build their own power base, though given the strict salic tradition of hereditary kingship, few would ever consider overthrowing the king.|$|E
40|$|Many {{businesses}} in the UK occupy premises on fixed term leases, which usually run for several years. During this time property requirements can change. This research critically examines the three main mechanisms by which tenants can bring their leases to an end; breaks, assignment and <b>subletting.</b> We examine the legal rules governing these devices and undertake an analysis of lease data and surveys. Break clauses are providing a useful exit mechanism for many tenants, but they cannot give the more general flexibility of assignment and <b>subletting.</b> However, change is necessary to ensure that these latter provisions provide real flexibility for tenants. ...|$|R

25|$|The metayer {{system was}} common, {{especially}} on temple lands. The landlord found land, labour, oxen for ploughing and working the watering machines, carting, threshing or other implements, grain seed, rations for the workmen and fodder for the cattle. The tenant, or steward, usually had other land of his own. If he stole the seed, rations or fodder, the Code stipulated that his fingers be cut off. If he appropriated or sold the implements, or impoverished or <b>sublet</b> the cattle, he was heavily fined and in default of payment, might be condemned {{to be torn}} to pieces by the cattle on the field. Rent was determined by contract.|$|E

25|$|Like {{the three}} other lighthouses in Saugeen Shores, Ontario, this station was {{nominated}} under the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act. The other three were subsequently designated as protected under the Act in 2012. The Chantry Island site {{has yet to be}} designated. The Act requires ownership of a light station to be first transferred from the federal government to another entity, such as the Town, which did take over ownership of the other lighthouses. That transfer has not occurred because of the uncertainty created by First Nations land claims to islands in the Lake Huron basin. In the meantime, the Chantry Island light station is leased to the Town and <b>sublet</b> to the Marine Heritage Society.|$|E
25|$|To {{the north}} of the library, where an Athletic Institute was {{originally}} to stand, a six-storey office block was built in 198889 by Leonard J. Multon & Partners.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{increasing}} numbers of low-income families in Third World cities have {{found it necessary to}} share housing accommodation. Those with access to land may be unable to afford to build their house or to pay the fees associated with their housing (particularly in upgrading or sites & service projects). Families who entered the market later may be unable to buy land as a result of tightening markets. Government has interests in this process because, while it takes away aspects of their control in sponsored projects, it produces new housing stock with a minimum of government's financial or administrative resources,and without consuming government owned land or the land of powerful political constituents. This thesis is divided into three parts. The first explores the interests of government in <b>subletting.</b> The second looks at the housing needs of landlord-occupants and renters in the present context. And, the third examines three mechanisms of subletting: commodification of housing, consolidation (as both a prerequisite to and result of <b>subletting),</b> and architectural design as an agent in the occurrence of <b>subletting.</b> by Susan Ruth Bailey.
