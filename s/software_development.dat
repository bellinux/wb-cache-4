The two projects described remarkably display the same strong trends even though they were done in very different parts of the business, in different kinds of <b>software</b> <b>developments,</b> and in different geographic locations. Both projects had an organizational {{structure of}} strongly empowered teams, understood the technical problems and their solutions at a fundamental level (a good match of core competencies and expert knowledge of problem), and used some innovative software engineering technology.
