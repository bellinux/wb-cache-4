Tachanun is said according to nusach Ashkenaz. No vidui is said at Mincha, as per nusach Ashkenaz. However, Kaddish and Kedushoh are said according to nusach Sefard, and Boruch she'omar is said after Hodu.|$|E

50|$|Casriel Dovid Kaplin {{was born}} in the East End of London in 1931 (Chol Hamoed <b>Sukkos</b> 5632) to Jerusalem-born Noach Kaplin, a {{grandson}} of Reb Nochum Magid who formerly held lectures in the Hurva Synagogue in the Old City of Jerusalem. During World War II the family was evacuated to Letchworth because of their dwelling's proximity to the London Docks, a major target of German bombing. He became barmitzva while living at Letchworth; in later years he would bemoan {{the fact that he was}} not able to have his own personal tefilin at the ceremony. However, the pilpul (discourse) he delivered on the occasion of his barmitzva was heard by Rabbi Elya Lopian and Dayan Yehezkel Abramsky, two great Torah scholars who were living in Letchworth at the time.|$|E
5000|$|S'chach has {{to derive}} from things that have [...] "grown from the ground", such as palm leaves, bamboo sticks and pine tree branches. Some types of wooden slats {{and other types of}} organic {{material}} can be used for s'chach, unless they were processed for a different use. The s'chach must have been disconnected from the ground so, for example, placing a sukkah under the boughs of a tree would render it not valid. As a minimum, the s'chach must be thick enough that it provides more shade than light in the sukkah. As a maximum, there is a concept of being able to see the stars through the s'chach, but the absolute maximum is that rain should be able to penetrate into the sukkah.If the sukkah is kept year round, you must replace the s'chach no more than 30 days before <b>Sukkos.</b> It is not necessary to completely remove the s'chach; it would be sufficient to lift each piece of s'chach up one foot or more into the air, and then put it back down.|$|E
