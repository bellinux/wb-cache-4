5|$|Stela 14 {{dates to}} about AD 870 and <b>stands</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{junction}} of two causeways {{and is in}} a good state of preservation. It has stylistic similarities with sculptures at distant Chichen Itza in the extreme north of the Yucatán Peninsula.|$|E

Jain artwork in temples and texts depicts the final liberation and {{cremation}} of Mahavira, sometimes symbolically shown as a miniature pyre of sandalwood {{and a piece of}} burning camphor.|$|E
5|$|A {{memorial}} {{stone was}} raised at Syrebekkstølen, commemorating {{the death of}} Tronstad and Gunnar Syverstad. Also, several streets in Norway have been named after him. A statue of Tronstad today <b>stands</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> square Leif Tronstads plass in Sandvika, the administrative centre of Bærum.

5|$|Isidore's Latin, {{replete with}} nonstandard Vulgar Latin, <b>stands</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cusp of Latin {{and the local}} Romance {{language}} of Hispania. According to the prefatory letters, the work was composed {{at the urging of}} his friend Braulio, Bishop of Saragossa, to whom Isidore, {{at the end of his}} life, sent his codex inemendatus ("unedited book"), which seems to have begun circulating before Braulio was able to revise and issue it with a dedication to the late Visigothic King Sisebut.|$|E
5|$|It {{consists}} of three buildings, namely the station itself, the operation center on the northeast side, and the parking tower on the southwest side. The size of the station is smaller {{than the other two}} buildings, but it is the focal point as it <b>stands</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> center of the site and provides most of the services and functions.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} of the Castellania contains offices, court halls, a chapel and prison cells. A large allegorical statue representing Lady Justice or Astraea wearing a blindfold and holding weighing scales <b>stands</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> staircase which lead to the former courtrooms. The statue stands on a pedestal, and its sculptor is unknown. The staircase is grandiose on its own.|$|E
5|$|East Tilbury, which <b>stands</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{western end}} of {{the section of the}} Thames known as Lower Hope Reach, was {{fortified}} long before the building of Coalhouse Fort due to its vulnerability to seaborne attackers. Settlements {{on both sides of the}} Thames were raided by the French in 1379 during the second phase of the Hundred Years' War. The attack prompted the building of Cooling Castle on Kent's Hoo Peninsula between 1380 and 1385 but there was initially no corresponding move to improve the defences of East Tilbury.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the entire}} party, none were skilled skiers and only Bernacchi and Armitage had any {{experience}} with dog-sledges. The {{results of the}} men's early efforts to master these techniques were not encouraging, and tended to reinforce Scott's preference for man-hauling. The dangers of the unfamiliar conditions were confirmed when, on 11 March, a party returning from an attempted journey to Cape Crozier became stranded on an icy slope during a blizzard. In their attempts to find safer ground, one of the group, Able Seaman George Vince, slid {{over the edge of}} a cliff and was killed. His body was never recovered; a cross with a simple inscription, erected in his memory, still <b>stands</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> summit of the Hut Point promontory.|$|E

5|$|The Queen's castle {{was used}} {{prominently}} in the advertising of the film (acting as {{the backdrop of the}} film's poster). Later Disney fairy tales, including Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, feature similarly fantastical castles and palaces, and often these buildings act as centrepieces or backdrops for the movies' posters. A fairy tale castle <b>stands</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> centre of each Disney theme park, and the image of the castle is used in the logo for Buena Vista International.|$|E
5|$|The {{church and}} {{cemetery}} are accessible through a gravel driveway to the north; to the west, {{a cluster of}} tall oak trees blocks access to the road. Capon Chapel is landscaped with boxwoods on its north and south sides, a single holly on its east side, and forsythias along its west side. The Capon Chapel property consists of the church structure (c. 1852), and its associated cemetery, which is enclosed partly by the historic wrought iron fence and partly by a chain link fence. A flagpole <b>stands</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> center of the cemetery's eastern perimeter.|$|E
5|$|The incline {{from there}} is not visible because of tree growth and it is {{difficult}} to get access to it without unreasonable encroachment on private property, although the OS map shows a public footpath crossing the incline about two-thirds of the way up. The remains of Brendon Hill station are Grade II listed. The remains of the summit winding house can be approached but are dangerous to enter: they are located just west of the junction of the B3224 and B3190 roads. A chapel built to attend to the spiritual needs of the miners and their families still <b>stands</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> junction.|$|E
