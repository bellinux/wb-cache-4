5|$|As the {{consultant}} {{talks with the}} residents of the town and investigates its history, the backstory of his injury is gradually revealed. After repeatedly <b>stubbing</b> his toe and covering it up with Apex bandages, {{the consultant}} accidentally stepped into pig feces during a company team retreat. Because of the colored bandage, he never discovered how his toe was badly infected, and fainted on the sidewalk after fleeing from an awards party. This led to the amputation of his toe, his departure from the nomenclature firm, and the beginning of his hermetic lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|Late one night, Ashley (Ashley Ryder)– a {{young man}} with a childlike mentality– arrives at the caravan home of his Uncle David (David Hoyle) on the Isle of Sheppey. Ashley confides in his uncle that his mother has been {{physically}} abusing him by <b>stubbing</b> cigarettes out on his hand. David lambasts the mother and society in general; the two embrace in a kiss before going to bed together. The next morning, they awake and have breakfast in bed before David bathes Ashley in the bathtub, telling him a story about an unhappy nuclear family. Going to a local café and then a park bench, David continues to explain his anti-establishment opinions about society. Ashley reveals that he wants to die, and the two express their love for one another.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Krabs {{is about}} to give SpongeBob and Patrick the job, but he hits his foot on a rock, {{dropping}} the paint and says all 13 swear words while complaining about his foot being injured. When SpongeBob and Patrick hear all the swear words, they run to Mama Krabs' house to tattle on him. When they all reach her house, they all explain what happened at once, saying the same swear words in the process. This makes her faint, but shortly after Mr. Krabs scolds SpongeBob and Patrick for saying all those bad words {{in front of her}} she regains consciousness. Mama Krabs states that all three of them should be ashamed for saying all those words. She then gives all three of them the task of painting her house with a fresh coat of paint as punishment. Later on, she leaves the three alarmed when she appears to be saying a 14th swear word after <b>stubbing</b> her toe on a rock; she claims that the sound came from Old Man Jenkins, who is driving by in his jalopy, which produces an identical sound and everyone laughs.|$|E
50|$|Radial <b>stubs</b> are a planar {{component}} {{that consists of}} a {{sector of a circle}} rather than a constant-width line. They are used with planar transmission lines when a low impedance <b>stub</b> is required. Low characteristic impedance lines require a wide line. With a wide line the junction of the <b>stub</b> with the main line is not at a well defined point. Radial <b>stubs</b> overcome this difficulty by narrowing to a point at the junction. Filter circuits using <b>stubs</b> often use them in pairs, one connected to each side of the main line. A pair of radial <b>stubs</b> so connected is called a butterfly <b>stub</b> or a bowtie <b>stub.</b>|$|R
5|$|Another common {{low-pass}} design {{technique is}} {{to implement the}} shunt capacitors as <b>stubs</b> with the resonant frequency set above the operating frequency so that the <b>stub</b> impedance is capacitive in the passband. This implementation has a lumped-element counterpart of a general form similar to the filter of figure 6. Where space allows, the <b>stubs</b> may be set on alternate sides of the main line {{as shown in figure}} 7(a). The purpose of this is to prevent coupling between adjacent <b>stubs</b> which detracts from the filter performance by altering the frequency response. However, a structure with all the <b>stubs</b> on the same side is still a valid design. If the <b>stub</b> is required to be a very low impedance line, the <b>stub</b> may be inconveniently wide. In these cases, a possible solution is to connect two narrower <b>stubs</b> in parallel. That is, each <b>stub</b> position has a <b>stub</b> {{on both sides of the}} line. A drawback of this topology is that additional transverse resonant modes are possible along the λ/2 length of line formed by the two <b>stubs</b> together. For a choke design, the requirement is simply to make the capacitance as large as possible, for which the maximum <b>stub</b> width of λ/4 may be used with <b>stubs</b> in parallel on both sides of the main line. The resulting filter looks rather similar to the stepped impedance filter of figure 5, but has been designed on completely different principles. A difficulty with using <b>stubs</b> this wide is that the point at which they are connected to the main line is ill defined. A <b>stub</b> that is narrow in comparison to λ can be taken as being connected on its centre-line and calculations based on that assumption will accurately predict filter response. For a wide <b>stub,</b> however, calculations that assume the side branch is connected at a definite point on the main line leads to inaccuracies as this is no longer a good model of the transmission pattern. One solution to this difficulty is to use radial <b>stubs</b> instead of linear <b>stubs.</b> A pair of radial <b>stubs</b> in parallel (one on either side of the main line) is called a butterfly <b>stub</b> (see figure 7(b)). A group of three radial <b>stubs</b> in parallel, which can be achieved at the end of a line, is called a clover-leaf <b>stub.</b>|$|R

[...] Rivernall may not have wanted to pay the charge for the letter, or he may have wished {{to distance himself from}} Turpin's affairs, and so the letter was moved to the post office at Saffron Walden where James Smith, who had taught Turpin how to write while the latter was at school, recognised the handwriting. [...] He alerted JP Thomas <b>Stubbing,</b> who paid the postage and opened the letter. [...] Smith travelled to York Castle and on 23February identified Palmer as Turpin.

50|$|In {{microwave}} and radio-frequency engineering, a <b>stub</b> or resonant <b>stub</b> is {{a length of}} transmission line or waveguide that is connected at one end only. The free end of the <b>stub</b> is either left open-circuit or (always {{in the case of}} waveguides) short-circuited. Neglecting transmission line losses, the input impedance of the <b>stub</b> is purely reactive; either capacitive or inductive, depending on the electrical length of the <b>stub,</b> and on whether it is open or short circuit. <b>Stubs</b> may thus function as capacitors, inductors and resonant circuits at radio frequencies.|$|R
5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, <b>stubs</b> {{lend themselves}} to band-pass designs. General forms of these are similar to <b>stub</b> low-pass filters except that the main line {{is no longer a}} narrow high impedance line. Designers have many different topologies of <b>stub</b> filters to choose from, some of which produce identical responses. An example <b>stub</b> filter is shown in figure 12; it consists of a row of λ/4 short-circuit <b>stubs</b> coupled together by λ/4 impedance transformers. The <b>stubs</b> {{in the body of the}} filter are double paralleled <b>stubs</b> while the <b>stubs</b> on the end sections are only singles, an arrangement that has impedance matching advantages. The impedance transformers have the effect of transforming the row of shunt anti-resonators into a ladder of series resonators and shunt anti-resonators. A filter with similar properties can be constructed with λ/4 open-circuit <b>stubs</b> placed in series with the line and coupled together with λ/4 impedance transformers, although this structure is not possible in planar technologies.|$|R

40|$|We {{have built}} a {{research}} operating system in which all services are presented through interfaces described by an interface description language. The system consists of a micro-kernel that supports {{a small number of}} these interfaces, and a large number of interfaces that are implemented by user-level code. A typical service implements one or more interfaces, but is a client of many other interfaces that are implemented elsewhere in the system. We have an interface compiler that generates client-side and server-side <b>stubs</b> to deliver calls from clients to servers, providing location transparency if the client and server are in different address spaces.

Open-circuited <b>stubs</b> are also theoretically possible, but an implementation in waveguide is not practical because electromagnetic energy would be launched out of the open end of the <b>stub,</b> resulting in high losses. <b>Stubs</b> are a kind of resonator, and the lumped element equivalent is an LC resonant circuit.
