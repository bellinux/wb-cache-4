5|$|The {{karyotype}} in T.talamancae is variable. Samples {{from two}} different localities in Venezuela have 34chromosomes and a fundamental number of 64 chromosomal arms (2n=34, FN=64). Four specimens from another Venezuelan locality each have a different karyotype, {{with the number of}} chromosomes ranging from 40 to 42 and the fundamental number from 66 to perhaps 67. The autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) of the 2n=34 karyotype all have two major arms, but the 2n=40–42 karyotypes include several acrocentric autosomes, which only have one major arm. The 2n=34 karyotype includes two large submetacentric pairs, which have two long arms but one distinctly longer than the other, and one pair of subtelocentric chromosomes, with a long and a much <b>shorter</b> <b>arm,</b> but the 2n=40–42 karyotypes lack the submetacentrics and have another pair of subtelocentrics. Both Robertsonian translocations (fusions of the long arm of one chromosome with the long arm of another and the short arm of the one with the short arm of the other) and pericentric inversions (reversals of part of a chromosome that includes the centromere) are needed to explain {{the difference between the two}} groups. Musser and colleagues, in discussing these karyotypes, assumed that the 2n=40–42 sample was from within a hybrid zone between two karyotypic morphs.|$|E

50|$|TX {{multirotor}} UAV is an unmanned helicopter with a {{total of}} sixteen rotors which are arranged in a very unusual way that is different than most multirotors currently in serive. The layout of TX Multirotor is a large cross, and each arm of the large cross is a smaller cross. There are four rotors installed on each arm of the large cross, with two rotors on the tips of the <b>shorter</b> <b>arm</b> of the small cross. The remaining two rotors is mounted on longer arm of the smaller cross, with one {{on each side of the}} <b>shorter</b> <b>arm,</b> one of them halfway between the <b>shorter</b> <b>arm</b> and the tip of the longer arm, and the other halfway between the <b>shorter</b> <b>arm</b> and the base of the longer arm that is attached to the center of the multirotor.|$|E

40|$|Chromosomal heteromorphisms are {{described}} as interindividual variation of chromosomes without phenotypic consequence. Chromosomal polymorphisms detected include most regions of heterochromatin of chromosomes 1, 9, 16 and Y and the <b>short</b> <b>arms</b> of all acrocentric chromosomes. Here, we report a girl with Down-syndrome such as facies and tremendously enlarged <b>short</b> <b>arm</b> of a chromosome 22. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a probe specific for all acrocentric <b>short</b> <b>arms</b> revealed that the enlargement p arms of the chromosome 22 in question contained exclusively heterochromatic material derived from an acrocentric <b>short</b> <b>arm.</b> Parental studies identified a maternal origin of this heteromorphism. Cryptic trisomy 21 of the Down-syndrome critical region was excluded by a corresponding FISH-probe. Here, we report, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, largest ever seen chromosome 22 <b>short</b> <b>arm,</b> being ~× 1. 5 larger than the normal long arm...|$|R

These two extra copies are found in the cell as an isochromosome, in addition to the normal 46 chromosomes. An isochromosome is formed when one of the arms of a chromosome is duplicated (in this case, the <b>short</b> <b>arm),</b> and the other is lost (in this case, the long arm), forming a chromosome with two identical arms.

50|$|The {{steel square}} {{is a tool}} used in carpentry. Carpenters use various tools to lay out {{structures}} that are square (that is, built at accurately measured right angles), {{many of which are}} made of steel, but the name steel square refers to a specific long-armed square that has additional uses for measurement, especially of various angles. Today the steel square is more commonly referred to as the framing square or carpenter's square. It consists of a long arm and a <b>shorter</b> <b>arm,</b> which meet at an angle of 90 degrees (a right angle). It can also be made of aluminum or polymers, which are light and resistant to rust.|$|E

Coptic crosses are made of four arms equal in length, {{each of which is}} crossed by a <b>shorter</b> <b>arm</b> (similar to the heraldic cross crosslet fitchy or cross bottony). The lotus flower, also known as the Egyptian White Water-lily (Nymphaea lotus), has been a symbol of creation since Ancient Egyptian times. Remains of the flower were found in the burial tomb of Pharaoh Ramesses II. Hence, its use on the flag represents the desire of all Coptic people to overthrow the Arab Islamic government and restore a native monarchy.|$|E
5000|$|A1::DQ2 is 4,731,878 {{nucleotides}} in length. The haplotype begins {{before the}} [...] locus approximately 28.8 million nucleotides from the telomere of chromosome 6's <b>shorter</b> <b>arm.</b> AH8.1 extends past the [...] about 33.5 million nucleotides from the telomer. Marked deterioration occurs however after the DQB1 gene at 32.8 million nucleotides. A1::DQ2 {{is not the}} longest haplotype, but the longest, HLA A3-Cw7-B7-DR15-DQ6 (A3::DQ6), had already undergone significant recombination and is nearly equal in frequency to HLA A2-Cw7::DQ6 bearing version. In the US Caucasians, 57% of haplotypes with a core component, Cw7-B8, extend from HLA-A1 locus to DQ2 locus. This compares with 25%of Cw7-B7 that extend to A3::DQ6 [...] Of 25 potential genetic recombinants of A1::DQ2, none exceed 10% of the Cw*0702-B*0801 frequency. Two recombinants A24-Cw7~DQ2, A1::B8-DR1-DQ5 are notable. Thus, A1::DQ2 haplotype is both long and shows greater deficiency of recombination (called linkage disequilibrium).|$|E

They are different from the Latin cross that possesses three short arms and a longer arm. The lotus flower, also known as the Egyptian White Water-lily (Nymphaea lotus), is one of ancient Egypt's most highly regarded flowers. It used to represent creation and resurrection, for it disappears under water after sunset, then resurfaces and blooms at dawn.

The source of the longer arm looks like a triangular area which is used as the borders of three districts: Espiye, Alucra and Torul.

After the two arms of the stream flow parallel for nearly 40-50 kilometers they aggregate as Gelevara after Arpacık village in Güce district adjacent to Espiye district. Gelevara flows down to Black Sea in the east end of Espiye town like Yağlıdere stream, its sister.

An awning supported on timber posts runs around 3 sides of the main living area. The external walls are built of volcanic rocks to sill height, with bark sheeting above. Internal walls are of slab and corrugated iron. Shutters hinged from above close window openings. The floor appears to be ant bed that has been repaired with concrete.
