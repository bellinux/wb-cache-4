5|$|In {{addition}} to archaeological evidence, Zenobia's life {{was recorded in}} different ancient sources but many are flawed or fabricated; the Augustan History, a late-Roman collection of biographies, is the most notable (albeit unreliable) <b>source</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> era. The author (or authors) of the Augustan History invented many events and letters attributed to Zenobia {{in the absence of}} contemporary sources. Some Augustan History accounts are corroborated from other sources, and are more credible.

5|$|Although {{called an}} offstream storage {{reservoir}} by USBR, the reservoir floods {{part of the}} San Luis Creek valley. San Luis Creek, however, is not the primary water <b>source</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> reservoir. Downstream of San Luis Reservoir is O'Neill Forebay, which is intersected by the Delta-Mendota Canal, a separate CVP facility. Water is pumped from the canal into the Forebay and uphill into San Luis Reservoir, which functions as an additional water source during dry periods.|$|E
5|$|Asser is {{sometimes}} {{cited as a}} <b>source</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> legend about Alfred's having founded the University of Oxford, which is now known to be false. A short passage making this claim was interpolated by William Camden into his 1603 edition of Asser's Life. Doubts have also been raised periodically about whether the entire Life is a forgery, written by a slightly later writer, but it is now almost universally accepted as genuine.|$|E
5|$|Ecgric (killed circa 636) was a king of East Anglia, the {{independent}} Anglo-Saxon kingdom that today includes the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. He {{was a member}} of the ruling Wuffingas dynasty, but his relationship with other known members of the dynasty is not known with any certainty. Anna of East Anglia may have been his brother, or his cousin. It has also been suggested that he was identical with Æthelric, who married Hereswith and was the father of Ealdwulf of East Anglia. The primary <b>source</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> little that is known about Ecgric's life is Bede's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{this series}} of events is {{extremely}} improbable. Constantius had already left Helena {{by the time he}} left for Britain.

5|$|Hugh de Neville was {{a member}} of the {{household}} of Prince Richard, later , and also served Richard's father, King Henry II at the end of Henry's reign, administering two baronies for the king. Neville accompanied Richard on the Third Crusade; he was one of the few knights who fought with the king on 5 August 1192 outside the walls of Jaffa, when the king and a small force of knights and crossbowmen fought off a surprise attack by Saladin's forces. Neville's account of events was a <b>source</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> chronicler Ralph of Coggeshall's entries on Richard's activities in the Third Crusade.|$|E
5|$|Kauri gum is a fossilised resin detracted from kauri trees (Agathis australis), {{which is}} made into crafts such as jewellery.

Even afterward, ancient kauri fields continued to provide a <b>source</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> gum and the remaining forests.|$|E

5|$|One {{possible}} lingering {{effect of}} the Winfield Scotts wreck was the introduction of black rats to the ecosystem of the Channel Islands.

5|$|Patras, on {{the northwestern}} {{coast of the}} Peloponnese, is claimed by the Chronicle of Monemvasia—a work of highly disputed {{accuracy}} and chronology, but an essential <b>source</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> period—to {{have been one of}} the cities abandoned c. 587/8 as a result of the Slavic depredations, its population fleeing to Rhegion in Calabria. This was followed by 218 years of independent Slavic rule in the Peloponnese, until around 804/5. The archaeological record on the other hand shows Patras to have remained in Byzantine control throughout the period, although it is possible that part of the population indeed emigrated to Italy.|$|E
