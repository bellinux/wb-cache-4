40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{simulate}} the nonlinear wave propagation in granular chains of beads using a recently introduced multiple impact model and to compare numerical results to experimental ones. Different kinds of granular chains are investigated: monodisperse chains, tapered <b>chains</b> and <b>stepped</b> <b>chains.</b> Particular attention is paid to the dispersion effect, and the wave propagation in tapered chains, the interaction of two solitary waves in monodisperse chains, and the formation of solitary wave trains in <b>stepped</b> <b>chains.</b> We show that the main features of the wave propagation observed experimentally in these granular chains are very well reproduced. This proves that the considered multiple impact model and numerical scheme are able to encapsulate the main physical effects that occur in such multibody systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A fair {{scheduling}} algorithm {{accounting for}} the weight and execution time of tasks is critical in the Grid environment. The MTWCT (Minimize Total Weighted Completion Time) has been proved to minimize the total weighted completion time {{of a set of}} independent tasks in a processor, but it results in another problem that the response time of some tasks is far longer. To decrease the incidence of the starvation phenomena, an improved algorithm named CSA (Controlled Scheduling algorithm) based on MTWCT is proposed, which computes the ρ factors of tasks by the execution time and weight of <b>step</b> <b>chains,</b> and selects the unexecuted <b>step</b> <b>chain</b> in terms of ρ factor and the executed time of task. Experimental results exhibit that CSA compared with the MTWCT, decreases the completion time of short tasks and the average turnaround time by sacrificing a little total weighted completion time...|$|R

40|$|Value {{creation}} and value appropriation are key aims of business organisations. While value {{has been studied}} in many management contexts, the value creating potential of product returns management remains under-researched. Extant literature on product returns management has concentrated on the cost dimension of the returns process, with limited attention given to exploring the nature of value, its creation, and appropriation. The boundary spanning scope of product returns management has also been ignored, with most studies focussing on the activity of a single party in the product <b>returns</b> <b>chain.</b> Further, despite {{the increasing use of}} 3 PLs in product returns management, the role of the 3 PL in value creation remains little understood. This research examines what value means in the context of product returns. It explores how value is created and appropriated in a product <b>returns</b> <b>chain</b> using a triadic case study composed of a retailer, two of its suppliers, and a 3 PL engaged by the retailer, in the consumer electronics sector. The research extends the understanding of product returns value beyond a single party in the <b>returns</b> <b>chain</b> to a triad of entities. Using an inductive qualitative methodology, this study found that value in the product <b>returns</b> <b>chain</b> was multi-dimensional. Value consisted of tangible (financial) and intangible elements; residual product value was of little importance to the suppliers and the retailer in the study. The main drivers of value involved the structure of the product <b>returns</b> <b>chain,</b> a collaborative orientation of the parties, and information management. The study also identified a process of value evolution that explains changes in value for the product <b>returns</b> <b>chain</b> parties when the <b>returns</b> <b>chain</b> changed from a decentralised configuration to a centralised structure. The study has two major contributions. First, it offers a comprehensive explanation of the nature of value in product returns, and contributes a value evolution matrix to explain how value in a product <b>returns</b> <b>chain</b> could be realised, based on the value orientation of the <b>returns</b> <b>chain</b> members, and the nature of facilitation in the product returns process. Second, it develops a value {{creation and}} appropriation framework to explain how value orientation of the parties in the product <b>returns</b> <b>chain</b> and external facilitation by a 3 PL could bring about process alignment to increase resource effectiveness and operational efficiency, and how trust, power, and relationship quality could affect value appropriation. These findings challenge the traditional cost-based view of product returns, offering insights on how a 3 PL could facilitate to align the operations of a retailer with those of its suppliers to create value in the product <b>returns</b> <b>chain.</b> The study contributes to our theoretical understanding of the product returns process, and reveals a practical managerial path to value creation and appropriation in product returns management...|$|R
40|$|Product returns {{management}} (PRM) is a core {{supply chain}} management process (Rogers, Lambert et al. 2002). Extant literature on PRM typically focuses on the cost dimension of the returns process (e. g., Stuart, Bonawi-tan et al. 2005), such as efficiency of reverse logistics activities (e. g., Richey, Chen et al. 2005), disposition of the returned products - product reuse, material recycling and salvage - and the associated aspects of production planning and inventory management (e. g., Li and Olorunniwo 2008). This paper overcomes the limitations in extant literature on PRM - it explores value creation and appropriation by several parties in the product <b>returns</b> <b>chain.</b> Specifically it answers the following research questions: - What constitutes value in the product returns process for parties involved in the <b>returns</b> <b>chain?</b> - How is value created in the product <b>returns</b> <b>chain?</b> - Who appropriates this value in the product <b>returns</b> <b>chain...</b>|$|R

In order to elucidate early nucleation stages polyester-coated nanotubes {{were obtained from}} highly diluted solutions. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) revealed helical morphologies for PET/SWNTs and PEN/SWNTs {{and the formation of}} lobules with different orientations for PBT/SWNTs. To explain the morphological behavior one model was proposed based on crystallographic interactions, that is, epitaxy. Theoretical epitaxy calculations indicated that epitaxy is not possible from the strict epitaxy point of view. Instead, aromatic self-assembly mechanism was proposed based on π-π interactions and the chirality of the nanotube. It was proposed that the mechanism implies two steps to produce helical or lobular morphologies with different orientations. In the first <b>step</b> polymer <b>chains</b> were approached, aligned parallel to the nanotube axis and adsorbed due to electrostatic interactions and the flexibility of the molecule.
