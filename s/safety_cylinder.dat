40|$|Abstract. To {{increase}} comprehensive {{properties of}} cylinder steel, high-pressure cylinder steel 30 CrMo-M was developed {{on the basis}} of steel 30 CrMo. Tests and researches were made on factors which influence heat treatment properties, such as chemical composition, quenching temperature, and tempering temperature. The results indicated that the 30 CrMo-M steel has stable chemical composition, its strength rises with increase of carbon equivalent, and thus it has better relativity. When concentration of quenching liquid is 5 %, yield ratio of the steel can be guaranteed to be low, thus <b>safety</b> of <b>cylinder</b> is improved. Tempered between 570 ℃~ 622 ℃, the strength of the steel is increased and plasticity rises with increase of temperature. When tempered at 570 ℃, inner wall structure of cylinder contains tempering martensite, the strength is high but the plasticity is low. When tempered between 610 ℃~ 615 ℃, temper brittleness happens very easily and toughness is on the low side. The best heat treatment technology is: quenched at 930 ℃ with temperature holding for 40 minutes and quenching liquid concentration as 5 %, tempered at 580 ℃ with temperature kept for 90 minutes. The microstructure treated by this technology is tempered sorbite with higher strength, plasticity and toughness...|$|R

Here, a theoretical analysis has been developed to study the effects of the natural gas composition on the filling process of an onboard Natural Gas Vehicle (NGV) cylinder. The cylinder is assumed as a lumped system. The analysis is based on laws of thermodynamics and mass balance. Based on AGA 8 Equation of State (EOS) and thermodynamics relationships, the required properties of natural gas mixtures have been calculated. The results are presented for an adiabatic system. The results show that the compositions of natural gas have great effects on the filling process and final in-cylinder conditions.

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science in Mobile Telecommunication and Innovation at (MSc. MTI) at Strathmore UniversityTracing and verification of the authenticity of filled Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders has been marked with numerous challenges especially in the Sub-Saharan region. With an increase in LPG consumption, numerous sales points have sprouted in residential estates which even sell unbranded cylinders. Some traders involved in the illegal refilling and branding of cylinders use cylinders that {{do not meet the}} quality standards of the Kenya Bureau of Standards, thus compromising consumers’ safety. Consequently, unlicensed gas operators are gaining an unfair advantage as they do not incur the cost of purchasing cylinders. Consumers end up paying the same for genuine and illegal products in spite of the non-compliance on <b>safety</b> checks, <b>cylinder</b> re-validation, gas specifications, quantity and value added tax remittance. This research used document survey and an online questionnaire that was distributed to 96 LPG consumers to provide a detailed study of the characteristics of the authenticity of a filled LPG cylinder, methods and technology currently used to trace and verify the authenticity of filled LPG cylinder and how a mobile application for tracing and verification of the authenticity of filled LPG cylinder can be designed, developed, tested and validated. The data collected from the 96 respondents was analysed using Google analytics tools and the results used to obtain the system requirements and design of an Android mobile application for tracing and verifying the authenticity of filled Liquefied Petroleum Gas cylinders. Agile software development methodology was used which allows faster iteration and more frequent user feedback. The Android application was integrated with an analytical back-end for LPG manufacturers, distributors and retailers that present a summary of LPG supplies made. Testing and validation was done on the final prototype by the potential users and developer of the application. Users stand to benefit by using the mobile application to ensure their safety by verifying the authenticity of gas cylinders anytime and from anywhere...|$|R
40|$|This {{information}} sheet is about gas <b>cylinder</b> <b>safety.</b> While the Private Health Regulation Team usually sees small cylinders not secured properly, {{the content of}} this {{information sheet}} applies to all cylinders regardless of size, and to empty as well as full cylinders as there can be residual gas and pressure in an “empty ” cylinder. 1. This first excerpt and illustration is from www. safety. rochester. edu/safetyinfo/compressedgascylinders. pdfrochester. edu Highly pressurized, cylinders can become missile-like projectiles All compressed gas cylinders are hazardous {{because of the high}} pressures inside the cylinder. Cylinders can become damaged from falling, heat, electric circuits, motion, vibration or anything that can cause a weakness or crack in the cylinder wall or shell. There have been many cases in which damaged cylinders have ruptured, exploding sharp metal pieces in the surrounding area. The most common hazard associated with cylinders occurs when cylinders tip or fall over. Falling cylinders have broken bones and caused contusions; but far more dangerous, falling cylinders have been known to become missile-like projectiles, causing severe injury and damage. This can happen when unsecured cylinders are knocked over causing the cylinder valve to break and high pressure gas to escape rapidly. 2.

This study describes a novel technique in treating early PLE with under-flap CXL (ufCXL) to the stromal bed and reports on 6 -month outcomes. Patients and methods: Case series of seven patients (eight eyes) with topography-diagnosed early PLE treated with ufCXL. Inclusion criteria were early, mild PLE defined as new-onset postoperative manifest refraction cylinder ≤ 1. 50 D, with new topographic inferior steepening consistent with ectasia, uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) of 20 / 40 or better, and corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) of 20 / 25 or better. Existing LASIK flap was lifted, riboflavin was applied {{directly to the}} stromal bed, flap was repositioned, and 18 mW/cm 2 ultraviolet light was applied for 3 minutes to the corneal surface. Post-ufCXL manifest refraction, UDVA and CDVA, corneal cylinder, Kmax, and corneal irregularity index were compared with pre-ufCXL measurements. Results: Patients had a pre-ufCXL sphere of 0. 09 ± 0. 48 D and cylinder of − 0. 78 ± 0. 49 D. At  6  months, post-ufCXL sphere (0. 06 ± 0. 8 D; P= 0. 89) and cylinder (− 1. 09 ± 0. 76 D, P= 0. 26) were unchanged. Cumulative post-ufCXL UDVA was unchanged, achieving 20 / 20, 20 / 30, and 20 / 40 in 25 %, 88 %, and 88 %, respectively, compared with 13 %, 63 %, and 88 % pre-ufCXL (P= 0. 68). Post-ufCXL CDVA was unchanged (P= 0. 93) with a gain of one line in two eyes, a loss of one line in one eye, and five eyes unchanged. The efficacy index (P= 0. 76), safety index (P= 0. 89), Kmax (P= 0. 94), and corneal irregularity index (P= 0. 73) were also unchanged. Conclusion: Preliminary results with ufCXL for early PLE are promising, demonstrating maintenance of visual accuracy, efficacy, <b>safety,</b> Kmax, and <b>cylinder,</b> with much quicker recovery times than surface CXL.

40|$|The Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) is a {{high power}} and high neutron flux {{research}} reactor operating in the United States. Powered with highly enriched uranium (HEU), the ATR has a maximum thermal power rating of 250 MWth. Because of the high total core power and high neutron flux, the ATR is an ideal candidate for assessing the feasibility of converting an HEU driven reactor to a low-enriched core. An optimized low-enriched uranium (LEU) (U- 10 Mo) core conversion case, which can meet the project requirements, has been selected. However, LEU contains a significant quantity of high density U- 238 (80. 3 wt. %), which will harden the neutron spectrum in the core region. Based on the reference ATR HEU and the optimized LEU full core plate-by-plate (PBP) models, the present work investigates and compares the neutron spectra differences in the fuel element (FE), Northeast flux trap (NEFT), Southeast flux trap (SEFT), and East flux trap (EFT) positions. A detailed PBP MCNP ATR core model was developed and validated for fuel cycle burnup comparison analysis. The current ATR core with HEU U 235 enrichment of 93. 0 wt. % {{was used as the}} reference model. Each HEU fuel element contains 19 fuel plates with a fuel meat thickness of 0. 508 mm (20 mil). In this work, an optimized LEU (U- 10 Mo) core conversion case with a nominal fuel meat thickness of 0. 330 mm (13 mil) and the U- 235 enrichment of 19. 7 wt. % was used to calculate the impact of the neutron spectrum in FE and FT positions. MCNP-calculated results show that the neutron spectrum in the LEU FE is slightly harder than in the HEU FE, as expected. However, when neutrons transport through water coolant and beryllium (Be), the neutrons are thermalized to an equilibrium neutron spectrum as a function of water volume fraction in the investigated FT positions. As a result, the neutron spectrum differences of the HEU and LEU in the NEFT, SEFT, and EFT are negligible. To demonstrate that the LEU core fuel cycle performance can meet the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) safety requirements, additional studies will be necessary to evaluate and compare safety parameters such as void reactivity and Doppler coefficients, control components worth (outer shim control <b>cylinders,</b> <b>safety</b> rods and regulating rod), and shutdown margins between the HEU and LEU cores...|$|R
