50|$|The {{technology}} roadmap {{outlines the}} major initiatives for standardizing the IT environment and increasing IT’s efficiency and effectiveness {{over the next}} five years. The initiatives were determined by various sources including business-side IT roadmaps, executive management planning meetings, client planning sessions, and client year-end reviews. The three major initiatives identified are enterprise architecture, security and privacy programs, and fiscal discipline.The enterprise architecture initiative will focus on simplifying the environment to ensure stable and economical performance for mission-critical applications. Simplifying the environment to decrease costs will include activities, such as decreasing the number of application systems and migrating applications off the mainframe. Efficiencies will also be gained by expanding capabilities for manipulating large data sets and storing traditional paper-based files electronically. The SOA service center will manage code (or services) for all development teams to discover and use, which will <b>save</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs</b> in application development, testing and deployment.|$|E
5000|$|Colonial governments {{accepted}} {{a degree of}} responsibility for pauper patients who were not convicts. However, as convict numbers declined and the emancipated and free population grew, the government disengaged itself from direct responsibility for the 'respectable poor'. Meanwhile, the Sydney Dispensary had been created in 1826 to provide outpatient care for 'free poor persons, unable to pay for medical attendance'. It was conducted on traditional charitable lines and operated from several city premises before obtaining the south wing of the Rum Hospital in 1845 where it remained until 1848. This change in use of the South Wing required more repairs to {{the internal and external}} building fabric from 1843. At the same time, the Sydney Dispensary expanded to serve inpatients and changed its name to the Sydney Infirmary and Dispensary, a title officially approved in 1844. Convict inpatients continued to be treated in the separately managed hospital in the centre wing, next door. With the dissolution of the convict hospital system, the Sydney Infirmary and Dispensary gave up the south wing in 1848 in return for permissive occupancy of the entire middle section of the Rum Hospital complex.In 1851, the New South Wales Legislative Council petitioned to establish a mint in Sydney, {{to take advantage of the}} gold discovered by Edward Hargreaves at Ophir, just outside Bathurst.

40|$|Aims: It is very {{important}} to detect the coagulase-negative Staphylococci, which produce the hospital infections. Being {{one of the most expensive}} and time-consuming stages before the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA extraction is one of the primary stages of PCR. Then, it should be noticed that the elimination of the stage might <b>save</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs.</b> The aim of this study was to compare two PCR methods including the method with the utilization of the extracted DNA with the extraction kit and the direct PCR method in the detection of the methicillin-resistant genes in the coagulase-negative Staphylococci. Materials & Methods: In the descriptive cross-sectional study, 135 Staphylococcus epidermidis and 88 Staphylococcus saprophyticus samples were studied, separated from blood, wounds, urinary catheter, and urine samples of patients hospitalized in the treatment centers of Zahedan. The direct PCR was done on the Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis colonies. PCR with the extracted DNA was done for mecA and 16 srDNA genes using the extraction kit, and the results were compared. Findings: In both methods, mecA and 16 srDNA genes were successfully amplified in 310 bp and 420 bp related to Staphylococcus bacteria identifying gene and methicillin resistant gene, respectively. In addition, there were approximately the same band qualities. Conclusion: In order to <b>save</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs,</b> the direct PCR method can be used to detect methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci...|$|E
