50|$|Porosity Sealing or Resin Impregnation {{is similar}} to potting, but doesn't use a shell or a mold. Parts are {{submerged}} in a polymerizable monomer or solvent-based low viscosity plastic solution. The pressure above the fluid is lowered to a full vacuum. After the vacuum is released, the fluid flows into the part. When the part is withdrawn from the resin bath, it is drained and/or cleaned and then cured. Curing can consist of polymerizing the internal resin or evaporating the solvent, which leaves an insulating dielectric material between different voltage components. Porosity <b>sealing</b> (<b>Resin</b> Impregnation) fills all interior spaces, and {{may or may not}} leave a thin coating on the surface, depending on the wash/rinse performance. The main application of vacuum impregnation porosity sealing is in boosting the dielectric strength of transformers, solenoids, lamination stacks or coils, and some high voltage components. It prevents ionization from forming between closely spaced live surfaces and initiating failure.|$|E
40|$|The {{preventive}} {{effect of}} sealing materials depends on ability to penetrate into the fissures, and microleakage absence, resulting with better clinical success. The aim of {{present study was}} to investigate the influence of ozone on microleakage and penetration of nanoparticle fissure <b>sealing</b> <b>resin</b> and flowable composite, and quantitative and qualitative analysis of microleakage. Forty extracted non carious third molars were randomly divided in 4 groups. Group A: KaVo Healozone and Grandio Seal; Group B: Kavo Healozone and X-Flow; Group C: Grandio Seal; Group D: X-Flow. The teeth were thermocycled, immersed in 5 % methylene dye for 24 hours, and sectioned with precision saw. The total of 149 slices were analysed with stereomicroscope for microleakage and sealant penetration. According to qualitative scores, there is a significant difference between groups C and D, group C showing better results. According to quantitative scores, there are no statistical differences between the groups. The treatment of the enamel with KaVo HealOzone after etching does not affect either microleakage or penetration proportion of flowable composite or <b>sealing</b> <b>resin.</b> There is no statistically significant difference in a degree of penetration between different groups of sealing materials. Groups of materials with flowable composite in combination with an adhesive system show a good degree of penetration into the fissure and low microleakage meaning that they {{can be used as a}} fissure sealing materials...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Ethylene based ionomers {{have been}} used in film {{applications}} for many years. Ionic associations formed by neutralizing ethylene-acid copolymers with metal salts, typically sodium or zinc, give these ionomers a unique combination of low seal initiation temperature and high melt strength, clarity, stiffness, toughness, and oil and grease resistance that make them outstanding heat <b>seal</b> <b>resins.</b> New properties can be achieved by manipulating the nature and strength of the ionic associations. Examples of two new developments are described. The first is an ethylene ionomer that when blended with standard polyolefins such as PE or PP imparts permanent antistatic properties. The second is a new family of ionomers that have high gas permeability, which is important for a number of packaging film applications...|$|R

It was neccesary to prove the clinical success of sealing with flowable composite with the use of adhesive system and preventing effect of sealants on caries developement. Our study included children aged from 6 to 15, and we sealed 326 teeth with materials from the group of flowable composites in combination with adhesive system (Admira Bond+Admira Flow, Excite+ Tetric Flow) and other <b>sealing</b> <b>resins</b> (Teethmate F 1, Admira Seal, Helioseal Clear Chroma, Fissurit FX).

Only 5 molars (1. 5 %) developed clinical caries, so fissure sealing has showed to be an excelent prevention of occlusal caries. Flowable composites used with adhesive system are equal to other sealing materials. Sealing materials show great and durable preventive effect against caries development in the fissure system.

The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the influence of rebonding and bleaching on the release of metallic ions and microstractures of admixed and spherical amalgams. Materials and Methods: This experimental in vitro study was performed on 96 Class V cavities (3. 5 mm in length, 2 mm in width and depth) prepared on sound human premolars and restored with amalgams containing spherical and admixed particles. In half of the samples of each amalgam type rebonding procedure was carried out with Scotchbond Multi-purpose adhesive system and Guardian <b>Seal</b> <b>resin</b> sealant. Then half of the amalgam restorations, with or without rebonding, were exposed to 30 % carbamide peroxide (n = 12). The amount of metallic ions released from amalgams was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. Surface topography and compositions of two samples in each group were observed under a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Data were analyzed by t-test and multivariate ANOVA (α = 0. 05). Results: 30 % carbamide peroxide gel caused a significant increase in Hg released from amalgams in non-rebonded groups (p value < 0. 001). There was no significant difference in ion release from spherical and admixed amalgams (p value = 0. 73). Rebonding resulted in significant reduction in Hg release (p value = 0. 007). Conclusion: Exposure of spherical and admixed amalgams to 30 % carbamide peroxide gel, without rebonding, caused a significant increase in Hg release from amalgam and changed amalgam microstructure.

40|$|International audienceDue to its {{chemical}} inertness and physical properties PET is particularly suitable for food packaging applications, especially for drinking water. More bottled water is consumed than other bottled beverages. This {{article is a}} survey and toxicological investigation of chemical compounds, which are able to diffuse from PET bottles to water. The exact detailed chemical composition of plastic materials is known only from information provided by manufacturers. A declaration of conformity according to EC regulation no. 10 / 2011 is required {{to ensure the safety}} of plastic materials in contact with foodstuffs. This regulation established a positive list of monomers and additives which are authorized for use in plastic materials. Some substances are subject to restrictions and/or specifications according to their toxicological data. However, Non-Intentionally Added Substances (NIAS) not listed in this regulation such as breakdown products from monomers and additives and/or impurities found in initial polymerization reactants may be present in a PET bottle wall. Also, recycled PET can be a source of unknown chemical compounds found in water. All these substances may potentially migrate from the PET bottle wall to bottled water. It is well-known that acetaldehyde and antimony are leached from PET bottles. However, several studies have shown the presence of other substances not expected a priori in bottled water, sometimes in non-negligible concentrations. The origin of these compounds has not been clearly established and remains controversial (PET container, cap <b>sealing</b> <b>resins,</b> background contamination, water processing steps, NIAS, etc). Overall, it is difficult to compare the reported results due to the variety of parameters favoring the release of substances (contact time, type of simulant, temperature, sunlight exposure and bottle color). Considering all these difficulties and controversies, further investigations are needed to clearly identify the migration products from PET and to ensure that the consumption of PETbottled water does not involve any health hazards...|$|R
40|$|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Self-adhesive resin cements were {{designed}} to bond without any pretreatment of dentin. However, pretreatments such as the application of desensitizing resin or the <b>resin</b> <b>sealing</b> of dentin with priming/bonding solutions might influence the bonding quality of these self-adhesive resin cements. Little {{is known about the}} effect of dentin pretreatment on the bond quality of self-adhesive resin cements. PURPOSE: This study evaluated whether dentin desensitizing or sealing methods influenced the shear bond strength of 1 self-adhesive and 2 conventional resin cements. MATERIAL AND METHODS: One-hundred and eighty human molars were assigned to 5 different pretreatment groups: 1) freshly ground dentin, 2) glutaraldehyde/hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA) desensitized dentin (Gluma), 3) contamination of desensitized dentin with provisional cement, 4) sealed dentin (dual bonding technique), and 5) contamination of sealed dentin with provisional cement. The shear bond strength of a self-adhesive resin cement (RelyX Unicem; RXU) and 2 conventional resin cements (Variolink II; VAR, Panavia 21; PAN) was assessed for each pretreatment group (n= 12 per cement types). Two-way ANOVA and 1 -way ANOVA together with the post hoc Tukey multiple comparison (α=. 05) were performed. RESULTS: On freshly ground dentin, PAN exhibited the highest shear bond strength values (P<. 001). The use of the glutaraldehyde/HEMA resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} bond strength of RXU as compared to fresh dentin (P<. 001). <b>Resin</b> <b>sealing</b> of dentin increased the bond strength of RXU but had no significant effect on VAR or PAN. RXU exhibited the highest mean bond strength after the contamination of resin-sealed dentin by provisional cement. CONCLUSIONS: Glutaraldehyde/HEMA treatment and <b>resin</b> <b>sealing</b> of dentin have a beneficial effect on the shear bond strength of self-adhesive resin cement (RXU). Contamination of dentin with provisional cement has no influence on the bond strength of the self-adhesive resin cement (RXU) or VAR but lowered the bond strength of PAN...|$|R
