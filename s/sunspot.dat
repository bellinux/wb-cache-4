5|$|At a {{distance}} of about eight light-minutes, the most frequently studied star is the Sun, a typical main-sequence dwarf star of stellar class G2 V, and about 4.6 billion years (Gyr) old. The Sun is not considered a variable star, but it does undergo periodic changes in activity known as the <b>sunspot</b> cycle. This is an 11-year oscillation in <b>sunspot</b> number. Sunspots are regions of lower-than- average temperatures that are associated with intense magnetic activity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{earliest}} known {{drawing of}} <b>sunspots</b> appears in The Chronicle of John of Worcester, which was compiled {{in the first}} half of the twelfth century. In this medieval chronicle, the Latin text describing the <b>sunspots</b> is accompanied by a colourful drawing, albeit idealised, which shows the apparent positions and sizes of two <b>sunspots</b> on the solar disk. The date of this observation of <b>sunspots</b> from Worcester, England is firmly established as AD 1128 December 8. Assuming that the drawing was prepared fairly carefully, the angular diameters of the two <b>sunspots</b> are at least about 3 arcmin and 2 arcmin in the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively. Similarly, the heliographic latitudes of both <b>sunspots</b> are within the approximate range of 25 ◦ – 35 ◦. About five days after this observation of <b>sunspots</b> on the solar disk, o...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows that}} {{incomplete}} {{information can be}} {{a rich source of}} <b>sunspots</b> equilibria. This is demonstrated in a standard dynamic general equilibrium model of monopolistic competition … la Dixit-Stiglitz. In the absence of fundamental shocks, the model has a unique certainty (fundamental) equilibrium, but there are also multiple stochastic (<b>sunspots)</b> equilibria that are not mere randomizations over fundamental equilibria. In other words, <b>sunspots</b> can exist in infinite-horizon dynamic models with a unique saddle path steady state. In contrast to the recent <b>sunspots</b> literature (e. g., Benhabib and Farmer 1994), <b>sunspots</b> arising under incomplete information can be serially correlated and are robust to parameters associated with production technologies and preferences. Markup is always countercyclical in <b>sunspots</b> equilibria (which is consistent with empirical evidence) and fluctuations driven by <b>sunspots</b> look very similar to fluctuations driven by technology shocks.

5|$|An 11-year <b>sunspot</b> {{cycle is}} {{half of a}} 22-year Babcock–Leighton dynamo cycle, which {{corresponds}} to an oscillatory exchange of energy between toroidal and poloidal solar magnetic fields. At solar-cycle maximum, the external poloidal dipolar magnetic field is near its dynamo-cycle minimum strength, but an internal toroidal quadrupolar field, generated through differential rotation within the tachocline, is near its maximum strength. At {{this point in the}} dynamo cycle, buoyant upwelling within the convective zone forces emergence of toroidal magnetic field through the photosphere, giving rise to pairs of sunspots, roughly aligned east–west and having footprints with opposite magnetic polarities. The magnetic polarity of <b>sunspot</b> pairs alternates every solar cycle, a phenomenon known as the Hale cycle.|$|E
5|$|During {{the solar}} cycle's declining phase, energy shifts from the {{internal}} {{toroidal magnetic field}} to the external poloidal field, and sunspots diminish in number and size. At solar-cycle minimum, the toroidal field is, correspondingly, at minimum strength, sunspots are relatively rare, and the poloidal field is at its maximum strength. With {{the rise of the}} next 11-year <b>sunspot</b> cycle, differential rotation shifts magnetic energy back from the poloidal to the toroidal field, but with a polarity that is opposite to the previous cycle. The process carries on continuously, and in an idealized, simplified scenario, each 11-year <b>sunspot</b> cycle corresponds to a change, then, in the overall polarity of the Sun's large-scale magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Observations of <b>sunspots</b> were {{recorded}} during the Han Dynasty (206 BC–AD 220) by Chinese astronomers, who maintained records of these observations for centuries. Averroes {{also provided a}} description of <b>sunspots</b> in the 12th century. The invention of the telescope in the early 17th century permitted detailed observations of <b>sunspots</b> by Thomas Harriot, Galileo Galilei and other astronomers. Galileo posited that <b>sunspots</b> were {{on the surface of}} the Sun rather than small objects passing between Earth and the Sun.|$|R
5|$|<b>Sunspots</b> {{are visible}} as dark patches on the Sun's photosphere, and {{correspond}} to concentrations of magnetic field where the convective transport of heat is inhibited from the solar interior to the surface. As a result, <b>sunspots</b> are slightly cooler than the surrounding photosphere, and, so, they appear dark. At a typical solar minimum, few <b>sunspots</b> are visible, and occasionally none {{can be seen}} at all. Those that do appear are at high solar latitudes. As the solar cycle progresses towards its maximum, <b>sunspots</b> tend form closer to the solar equator, a phenomenon known as Spörer's law. The largest <b>sunspots</b> can be tens of thousands of kilometers across.|$|R
40|$|<b>Sunspots</b> are {{the most}} {{conspicuous}} aspects of the sun. They have a lower temperature, {{as compared to the}} surrounding photosphere; hence, <b>sunspots</b> ap-pear as dark regions on a brighter background. <b>Sunspots</b> cyclically appear and disappear with a 11 -year periodicity and are associated with a strong magnetic field (∼ 103 G) structure. <b>Sunspots</b> consist of a dark umbra, surrounded by a lighter penumbra. Study of umbra-penumbra area ratio can be used to give a rough idea as to how the convective energy of the sun is transported from the interior, as the <b>sunspot’s</b> thermal structure is related to this convective medium. An algorithm to extract <b>sunspots</b> from the white-light solar images obtained from the Kodaikanal Observatory is proposed. This algorithm computes the radius and center of the solar disk uniquely and removes the limb darkening from the image. It also separates the umbra and computes the position as well as the area of the <b>sunspots.</b> The estimated results are compared with the Debrecen Photoheliographic Results. It is shown that both area and position measurements are in quite good agreement. 1...|$|R

5|$|The Sun's {{magnetic}} field leads to many effects that are collectively called solar activity. Solar flares and coronal-mass ejections tend to occur at <b>sunspot</b> groups. Slowly changing high-speed streams of solar wind are emitted from coronal holes at the photospheric surface. Both coronal-mass ejections and high-speed streams of solar wind carry plasma and interplanetary {{magnetic field}} outward into the Solar System. The effects of solar activity on Earth include auroras at moderate to high latitudes and {{the disruption of}} radio communications and electric power.

This is possible, as there was a transit on May 24, 1032, but Avicenna did not give the date of his observation, and modern scholars have questioned whether he could have observed the transit from his location at that time; he may have mistaken a <b>sunspot</b> for Venus.

5|$|Celestial bodies {{interior}} to {{the orbit}} of Mercury have been hypothesized, and searched for, for centuries. The German astronomer Christoph Scheiner thought he had seen small bodies passing {{in front of the}} Sun in 1611, but these were later shown to be sunspots. In the 1850s, Urbain Le Verrier made detailed calculations of Mercury's orbit and found a small discrepancy in the planet's perihelion precession from predicted values. He postulated that the gravitational influence of a small planet or ring of asteroids within {{the orbit of}} Mercury would explain the deviation. Shortly afterward, an amateur astronomer named Edmond Lescarbault claimed to have seen Le Verrier's proposed planet transit the Sun. The new planet was quickly named Vulcan but was never seen again, and the anomalous behaviour of Mercury's orbit was explained by Einstein's general theory of relativity in 1915. The vulcanoids take their name from this hypothetical planet. What Lescarbault saw was probably another <b>sunspot.</b>|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{calculations of}} the magnetic helicity injection due to rotating <b>sunspots</b> and a determination {{of the characteristics of}} the rotating <b>sunspots</b> in the active regions with simple magnetic configurations. Four active regions are investigated to study the relationship between rotating <b>sunspots</b> and magnetic helicity. The observations indicate that significantly more helicity is injected during the period of rotation in polarities with strong magnetic field. This may be a result of the emergence of a magnetic flux rope from below the solar surface. Moreover, our preliminary study on a large sample of 90 active regions shows that the level of flaring activity increases with the rate of helicity injection. Finally, a statistical study is carried out to determine the relation between rotating <b>sunspots</b> and the emergence of magnetic flux tubes. Among 82 active regions which exhibit flux emergence, 93 % are associated with rotating <b>sunspots.</b> Among 50 active regions without well-defined flux emergence, 60 % of <b>sunspots</b> are observed to be rotating, though relatively slowly.

25|$|Due to its link {{to other}} kinds of solar activity, <b>sunspot</b> {{occurrence}} {{can be used to}} help predict space weather, the state of the ionosphere, and hence the conditions of short-wave radio propagation or satellite communications.

Sunspots themselves, in terms of the magnitude of their radiant-energy deficit, have a weak effect on terrestrial climate in a direct sense.
