40|$|Abstract—The use of Impulse Radio-Ultra Wide Band (IR-UWB) {{introduced}} a low data rate and {{low power consumption}} systems, which are suitable for sensor networks. Due to strict regulations of the power transmission and frequency use, the range and usage of IR-UWB remained very limited. To enlarge the range of UWB, this paper presents a system design on how to replace the radio part of the physical layer (PHY) of UWB by free space optics, without changing the major parts of the <b>standard,</b> including <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> and coding. The performance of such a system on optical links is analyzed in Monte-Carlo simulation. The utilization of optical links will offer new configurations for uplink and downlink. This system will deal with optical noise and optical multipath channel and shows the performances {{of the new system}} in presence of Line of Sight (LOS) and diffuse links.

40|$|Channel-adaptive {{relaying}} {{has recently}} been proposed {{as a means to}} exploit spatial and temporal diversity in multihop ad hoc networks with fading. In conjunction with appropriate routing protocols, adaptive relaying enables each forwarding node in a multihop path to dynamically select the next-hop relay {{as a function of the}} measured (time-varying) channel state, providing a form of selection diversity at each hop. Based on the notion that links to diversity-selected relays have higher information capacity and therefore can support higher data rates than links obtained with traditional routing, this paper proposes marrying channel-adaptive relaying with rate adaptation (or adaptive modulation-coding). In particular, we specify a protocol for performing joint rate and relay adaptation in 802. 11 ad hoc networks with geographic routing. Using both analytical and simulation tools, synergistic gains are observed in throughput, capacity and delay. Performance results are given for individual links as well as for multihop networks, in time-varying, correlated Rayleigh and Ricean fading channels over a range of channel speeds. Of particular interest in this study is the robustness of the adaptation to increasing channel Doppler. As a by-product of this work, we propose a new, SNR-based rate adaptation scheme for use in 802. 11 systems that requires no modification to the <b>standard</b> 802. 11 <b>frame</b> <b>structure.</b> I...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> for {{spectrum}} sensing {{in a network}} of secondary users, and optimize the sum throughput of the network under the constraint on the aggregate interference offered by the network to the primary user. We contrast its performance with the traditional Stop And Sense (SAS) <b>frame</b> <b>structure,</b> which involves the secondary users stopping transmissions and sensing for spectrum holes. We obtain near-optimal, easily computable solutions for the sensing duration and sensing thresholds that approximately maximize the secondary throughput under an aggregate interference constraint. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we present a detailed comparison of the two schemes, and characterize the operating regimes where each <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> is preferable over the other. In general when switching latencies are not accounted for, {{we find that the}} proposed Simultaneous Sense and Access (SSA) <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> performs similar to the existing SAS <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> in terms of throughput for all values of primary signal SNR. When switching latencies are accounted for, the SSA <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> offers significantly higher throughput gain for all values of primary SNR.

The dynamic characteristics and the seismic {{performance of the}} RAC <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> are analyzed and validated with the shaking table test results. Specifically, the natural frequency and the typical responses (e.g., storey deformation, capacity curve, etc.) from Model 1 (exclusion of strain rate effect) and Model 2 (inclusion of strain rate effect) are analyzed and compared. It is revealed that Model 2 {{is more likely to}} provide a better match between the numerical simulation and the shaking table test as key attributes of seismic behaviors of the <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> are captured by this model. For the purpose to examine how seismic behaviors of the RAC <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> vary under different strain rates in a real seismic situation, a numerical simulation is performed by varying the strain rate.

It can diminish the impact on environment, by avoiding to dug or fill the slope, using an opening platform, supported by beams and columns. Because the <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> on a slope connects with the ground on different elevation level, it is evidently different from general <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> in seismic design. Four sets of <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> example on a slope sample are designed, with three opening floors connected with the ground on different elevation level, and three, six, nine, twelve upper floors correspondingly. The seismic responses characteristics of frames on a slope are studied in the paper from period, lateral deformation, seismic shear and so on, based on {{the analysis of the}} characteristics of <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> on a slope. The main conclusions are as follows: the slope can enhance structural lateral stiffness to a certain extent; the opening floors connected with the ground on different elevation level, are not necessarily frail stories; the distribution of seismic force is uneven between the columns in the same floors which connect with the ground on different elevation level, and fixed columns undertake more than others, making them more fragile; the torsional effect is noticeable in the <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> on a slope...|$|R
