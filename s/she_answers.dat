5|$|With {{a scenic}} {{view of the}} Taj Mahal, Chanda motivates Apu to always follow her dreams, as they are {{dependent}} on efforts and not circumstances. A few years later, Apu attends her Union Public Service Commission interview, having passed her examinations successfully. After being asked what inspired her to apply for IAS, <b>she</b> <b>answers</b> that she is inspired by her mother, who now tutors struggling math students for free.|$|E
5|$|Amfortas arrives, borne on a {{stretcher}} by Knights of the Grail. He calls out for Gawain, whose attempt at relieving the King's pain had failed. He is told that Gawain has left again, seeking a better remedy. Raising himself somewhat, the King says going off without leave ("?") {{is the sort of}} impulsiveness which led himself into Klingsor's realm and to his downfall. He accepts the potion from Gurnemanz and tries to thank Kundry, but <b>she</b> <b>answers</b> abruptly that thanks will not help and urges him onward to his bath.|$|E
60|$|Hermione paused before <b>she</b> <b>answered.</b> <b>She</b> saw {{perfectly}} well the other woman's vaunt: it seemed truly vulgar.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>answered</b> him as <b>she</b> {{might have}} <b>answered</b> her husband, {{in the days}} of her unhappy marriage.|$|R
60|$|Then Nina {{paused a}} moment before <b>she</b> <b>{{answered}}.</b> But <b>she</b> did <b>answer,</b> and answered with that bold defiant air which at first had disconcerted her aunt.|$|R
5|$|As Alice's memory {{begins to}} fade, she daydreams {{of her mother}} and sister, who died in a car crash when she was a teenager. She memorizes words and sets a series of {{personal}} questions on her phone, which <b>she</b> <b>answers</b> every morning. She hides sleeping pills in her room, and records a video message instructing her future self to swallow the pills when she can no longer answer the questions. As her disease advances, she becomes unable to give focused lectures and loses her job. She becomes lost searching for the bathroom in her own home and does not recognize Lydia after seeing her perform in a play.|$|E
5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) entertains her parents, William Scully (Don Davis) and Margaret Scully (Sheila Larken), {{shortly after}} Christmas. After they leave, she falls asleep on her sofa. Several hours later, {{she wakes up}} to see her father sitting across from her, {{speaking}} silently. The telephone rings, and after looking at the phone, she finds the chair empty again. <b>She</b> <b>answers</b> the call—from her mother, who tells her that her father {{died of a heart}} attack an hour earlier.|$|E
5|$|In March 2014, Dot is told by {{the police}} that Nick has died of {{respiratory}} failure from a heroin overdose the previous week. One of the police officers who breaks the news to Dot is Nick's son Charlie Cotton, although it is later revealed that he is impersonating a police officer. Charlie explains that he was conceived from a brief marriage Nick had with his mother Yvonne. During the funeral, Charlie and undertaker Les Coker prevent Dot from looking in the coffin. Dot is suspicious and invites Yvonne {{to tell the truth}} and she assures Dot that Charlie is her grandson. A few weeks later, Carol Jackson asks Charlie for advice, when he leaves his phone at her house, <b>she</b> <b>answers</b> a call and discovers that Nick is still alive.|$|E
60|$|She {{walked along}} at his side, and, gently {{accommodating}} himself to her humour, he said Coketown was a busy place, was it not? To which <b>she</b> <b>answered</b> 'Eigh sure! Dreadful busy!' Then he said, {{she came from}} the country, he saw? To which <b>she</b> <b>answered</b> in the affirmative.|$|R
60|$|She was {{far above}} the paltry {{affectation}} of being confused. <b>She</b> <b>answered</b> me as <b>she</b> might have <b>answered</b> a brother or a father.|$|R
60|$|Eve hesitated, and {{she changed}} colour slightly, before <b>she</b> <b>answered.</b>|$|R
5|$|Yoshikawa {{develops}} {{misgivings about}} Asami after {{he is unable}} to reach any of the references on her résumé, such as a music producer she claimed to work for, who is missing. However, Aoyama is so enthralled by her that he pursues her anyway. She lives in an empty apartment, containing a sack and a phone. For four days after the audition, she sits perfectly still next to the phone waiting for it to ring. When it finally does, <b>she</b> <b>answers</b> pretending that she never expected Aoyama to call. After several dates, she agrees to accompany him to a seaside hotel, where a smitten Aoyama intends to propose marriage. At the hotel, Asami reveals burn scars on her body. Before making love, Asami demands that Aoyama pledge his love to her and no one else. A deeply moved Aoyama agrees. In the morning, Asami is nowhere to be found.|$|E
25|$|Trinity, an infamous hacker, is cornered {{by police}} in an {{abandoned}} hotel. She overpowers them with superhuman abilities, but a group of sinister superhuman black-suited Agents lead the police in a rooftop pursuit. <b>She</b> <b>answers</b> a ringing public telephone and vanishes.|$|E
25|$|Gabriel has {{blond hair}} and multicoloured wings. His right hand is raised and in his left he holds lilies, {{traditionally}} found in paintings of the annunciation as symbols of Mary's virginity. His words to Mary are written alongside him in Latin: AVE GRACIA PLENA D(OMI)N(U)S TECU(M) ("Hail who art full of grace, the Lord is with you"). The horizontal inscription extends out the panel and halfway across the neighbouring image. As in van Eyck's Washington Annunciation of c. 1434–6, the letters of Mary's reply are inscribed in reverse and upside-down; as if for God to read from heaven, or for the holy spirit, as represented by the dove, to read as he hovers directly above her. <b>She</b> <b>answers</b> ECCE ANCILLAM D(OMI)NI ("Behold the handmaiden of the Lord").|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} sleep," [...] <b>she</b> <b>answered.</b> <b>She</b> spoke languidly and wearily. If {{she was an}} actress once, she had not {{forgotten}} her calling.|$|R
6000|$|Again Clara was silent, {{not knowing}} how to answer that last question. And when <b>she</b> did <b>answer</b> it, <b>she</b> <b>answered</b> it thoughtlessly. [...] "Of course he knows that he can do that." ...|$|R
60|$|Agatha's eyes fell. She {{felt that}} she could not look at him nor could <b>she</b> <b>answer</b> his {{question}} honestly as <b>she</b> desired to <b>answer</b> it.|$|R
25|$|The bar {{is packed}} with students, artists and flower girls, singing and dancing. Magda enters and attracts the {{attention}} of several young men. She hurries over to a table at which Ruggero is sitting alone. She apologizes for intruding and tells him that she will move away {{as soon as the}} young men at the bar stop watching her. Ruggero, who does not recognize Magda in her disguise, asks her to stay. They chat and Ruggero tells Magda that she reminds him of the quiet and elegant girls from his home town, Montauban. They dance happily together. Prunier and Lisette enter, arguing about Prunier's desire to turn Lisette into a lady and to educate her. Magda and Ruggero return to their table and Magda begins to reminisce about a past love affair. Ruggero asks for her name and <b>she</b> <b>answers</b> 'Pauletta'. She writes the name on the tablecloth and Ruggero adds his own beneath. The attraction between Magda and Ruggero grows as they talk. Lisette and Prunier pass their table and Lisette recognizes Magda. Magda signals to Prunier not to give away her secret and Prunier tells Lisette she is mistaken. To prove his point, he introduces Lisette to Magda, who tries to maintain her disguise, to the puzzlement of Lisette. The two couples sit together and drink a toast to love. Prunier notices that Rambaldo has come in, and orders Lisette to take Ruggero out of the room for a few minutes, which she does. Rambaldo demands an explanation from Magda for her behaviour and disguise; she tells him that she has nothing to add to what he has already seen. Rambaldo suggests they leave together but she refuses and declares her love for Ruggero, apologizing for any pain she is causing Rambaldo by her actions. Rambaldo tells her that he cannot prevent her staying with Ruggero. As he leaves, Ruggero returns, and tells Magda that dawn is breaking. They decide to begin a new life together, but Magda secretly worries that she is deceiving Ruggero.|$|E
500|$|Leslie and Tom {{arrive at}} the pageant. Leslie, who wants the Miss Pawnee winner to be dignified and graceful, favors Susan (Anne Elizabeth Gregory), a student and children's {{hospital}} volunteer. But the other judges favor Trish (April Marie Eden), an attractive but untalented and unintelligent woman. Tom is particularly impressed with Trish, even when <b>she</b> <b>answers</b> Leslie's question about how [...] "we as citizens can improve on the great experiment?" [...] by making fluffy remarks about America and expressing a distaste for immigrants. April puts on an act by {{pretending to be a}} shallow beauty contestant, but instantly quits when she learns the $600 prize actually consists of gift certificates for a fence company.|$|E
500|$|Several {{chapters}} {{are devoted}} to a detailed [...] "behind the scenes" [...] look at how an episode of The Simpsons is made, including the writing, recording and animation. My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy contains multiple excerpts from Cartwright's diary detailing various events, mostly encounters with The Simpsons guest stars. Guest stars she talks about include Ernest Borgnine, Danny DeVito, Kirk Douglas, Mel Gibson, Kelsey Grammer, Tom Jones, Michael Jackson, Mickey Rooney, Meryl Streep and Elizabeth Taylor. One chapter describes the day she found out that Phil Hartman, a frequent guest star on The Simpsons, was murdered. The final chapter is a retrospective in which <b>she</b> <b>answers</b> the question [...] "what {{is it like to}} be the voice behind the star?" ...|$|E
60|$|A little flush {{crept into}} Carrie's face, but <b>she</b> <b>answered</b> languidly.|$|R
60|$|Her voice, when <b>she</b> <b>answered</b> me, {{showed some}} signs of agitation.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>answered,</b> looking all {{the while}} at her husband for leave.|$|R
500|$|The {{procession}} leaves. The squires eye Kundry with mistrust {{and question}} her. After a brief retort, she falls silent. Gurnemanz tells them Kundry has often helped the Grail Knights {{but that she}} comes and goes unpredictably. When he asks directly why she does not stay to help, <b>she</b> <b>answers,</b> [...] "I never help! (""). The squires think she is a witch and sneer that if she does so much, why will she not find the Holy Spear for them? Gurnemanz reveals that this deed is destined for someone else. He says Amfortas was given guardianship of the Spear, but lost it as he was seduced by an irresistibly attractive woman in Klingsor's domain. Klingsor grabbed the Spear and stabbed Amfortas. The wound causes Amfortas both suffering and shame, and will never heal on its own.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Beyoncé writing the {{sequence}} 9-4-8-1 and B'Day on the mirror with her lipstick. As the song begins, she briefly dances {{in a silver}} dress around a red room and later answers a telephone on a black couch. She, Solange, Rowland and Williams then walk across a multi-colored room to a black door where they all pose for the camera. As the chorus begins, Beyoncé, Solange, Rowland and Williams step out of a black limousine; they are all sporting matching silver dresses. They execute some dance steps as they walk inside, where people are partying. As the chorus ends, the song is paused while Beyoncé enters a room, where everyone begin to ask who she is, before <b>she</b> <b>answers,</b> [...] "It's B!" [...] and snaps her fingers to start back the music.|$|E
500|$|The Rights of Woman is an {{extension}} of Wollstonecraft's arguments in the Rights of Men. In the Rights of Men, as the title suggests, she is concerned with the rights of particular men (18th-century British men) while in the Rights of Woman, she is concerned with the rights afforded to [...] "woman", an abstract category. She does not isolate her argument to 18th-century women or British women. The first chapter of the Rights of Woman addresses the issue of natural rights and asks who has those inalienable rights and on what grounds. <b>She</b> <b>answers</b> that since natural rights are given by God, for one segment of society to deny them to another segment is a sin. The Rights of Woman thus engages not only specific events in France and in Britain but also larger questions being raised by political philosophers such as John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.|$|E
60|$|Again that inscrutable look {{gathered}} on the girl's face, and <b>she</b> <b>answered.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>answered</b> him, {{with the}} bright color {{suddenly}} flowing over her face.|$|R
60|$|She paused before <b>she</b> <b>answered,</b> for he {{was very}} stern and peremptory.|$|R
500|$|Elizabeth David asks why [...] "this {{peerless}} writer" [...] was {{eclipsed by}} [...] "imitators so limited in experience, and in capacity of expression so inferior?" [...] <b>She</b> <b>answers</b> her own question {{with the suggestion}} that Acton, born in 1799, was [...] "in taste and in spirit, {{a child of the}} eighteenth century." [...] David notes that the year after Modern Cookery was first published, Bird's Custard Powder was launched: [...] "What we know as modern cookery, and it {{had little to do with}} Eliza Acton's version, was on its way." [...] And she points out that manuals like Mrs Beeton's, which in later editions were edited and re-written by other hands, existed to allow cooks to look up recipes, rather than to read cookery books. She concludes that [...] "A book such as Miss Acton's, written as a coherent whole, is essentially one to be read, as it is written, with intelligence and understanding and application." ...|$|E
500|$|Sayid is torturing a Shiite {{prisoner}} {{suspected of}} bombing [...] "the Party's" [...] headquarters. When he steps outside, {{he sees a}} new prisoner who he recognizes. He is then instructed to torture her until <b>she</b> <b>answers</b> his questions. Sayid discovers that the woman is Nadia (Andrea Gabriel), a childhood friend. She reveals {{that she has been}} tortured before, and nothing Sayid does will persuade her to talk. Omar (Navid Negahban), Sayid's friend and superior officer, tells him to execute Nadia. Sayid cuffs Nadia and puts a hood over her head. When he and Nadia are alone he frees her and tells her how to escape. Omar finds them but Sayid fatally shoots him. Nadia thinks that Sayid will have to escape with her now, but he instead shoots himself in the leg and tells her to leave as reinforcements arrive, making it appear as if Nadia shot Sayid and the other officer to escape.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Stewie {{finds out}} that Brian has a new girlfriend. Brian later (reluctantly) allows Stewie to meet his new girlfriend, Jillian. Stewie discovers she is a dumb blonde, and mocks Brian. Jillian visits the house, where Peter and Chris take an instant liking to her while Lois and Stewie find her stupidity amusing. The next day, Brian goes out with Jillian, where he meets her equally unintelligent friends. [...] Stewie tells Brian that the {{relationship}} will not succeed. Brian visits Jillian's apartment to end the relationship (with Stewie waiting in his car), but he is distracted by her naked body when <b>she</b> <b>answers</b> the door and he has sex with her instead. Stewie apparently anticipated this when he returns three hours later, turns on the stereo, plays his mix tape, and starts singing {{to the tune of}} Gary Numan's [...] "Cars": [...] "Brian had sex/With a really dumb girl/Now he's taking his friend Stewie/To get some ice cream/In his car." [...] After Brian turns off the stereo, Stewie responds [...] "Oh, you're a poor sport.".|$|E
60|$|He {{glanced up}} hastily, and <b>she</b> <b>answered</b> the {{question}} in his eyes.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs Dale {{was silent}} {{for a minute or two}} before <b>she</b> <b>answered</b> this, but then <b>she</b> did <b>answer</b> it. [...] "I think I do," [...] said she. [...] "I think I do wish for it." ...|$|R
60|$|Mary waited, perhaps, {{for a whole}} {{minute before}} <b>she</b> <b>answered.</b> <b>She</b> would willingly have given the jewels away for ever and ever, {{so that they might}} not have been there now to trouble her. But <b>she</b> did <b>answer</b> at last, knowing, as she did so, that her last chance was gone.|$|R
