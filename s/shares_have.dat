Gateway bank agreed to be bought out by Hampton Roads Bankshares Inc. to make up for a writedown of $40 million on its stock in Fannie and Freddie, which put it below regulatory requirements to be considered adequately capitalized.|$|E
25|$|Lufthansa was a {{state-owned}} enterprise (and flag carrier) until 1994. Deutsche Lufthansa AG <b>shares</b> <b>have</b> been publicly traded on all German stock exchanges since 1966. In addition to floor trading, {{it is also}} traded electronically using the Xetra system. It is a DAX index share and is listed in the German Stock Exchange’s Prime Standard. In its annual report for 2016, Lufthansa reported that German investors held 68.6 per cent of the shares (previous year: 74.9 per cent). The second largest group, with 13.4 per cent, were shareholders from the USA. Investors from Luxembourg accounted for 4.2 per cent, followed by the United Kingdom and Ireland, with 2.9 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively. This ensures continued {{compliance with the provisions}} of the German Aviation Compliance Documentation Act (LuftNaSiG). 54.5 per cent (previous year: 53.9 per cent) of the shares were held by institutional investors and 45.5 per cent (previous year: 46.1 per cent) by private individuals.|$|E
25|$|The {{share is}} {{the cutting edge}} of the {{moldboard}} plow. The share makes the horizontal cut that separates the furrow slice from the soil below and when it is worn it is important to fit a new one. Conventional <b>shares</b> <b>have</b> points that are shaped. This shape, which was developed through years of field experience, penetrates ordinary soil efficiently and stands rough use. The share is shaped so that it pulls itself into the ground. As the share wears away, it becomes blunt and the plough will require more power to pull it through the soil. A plough body with a worn share will not have enough 'suck' to ensure that it penetrates the ground to its full working depth. The tip of the share is pointed downward, causing the plow to run into the ground. This is called “suction or down suck”; it literally sucks the plow into the ground, to a regulated depth. The clearance, also usually referred to as “suction or down suck”, varies with different makes and types of plows (the related clearance at the side is called “land suck”). Its configuration is related to soil type, particularly in the down suction, or concavity, of its lower surface. Generally, three degrees of clearance or down suction are recognized: regular for light soil, deep for ordinary dry soil, and double-deep for clay and gravelly soils. In addition, the share has horizontal suction, which is related to the amount its point is bent out of line with the landside. Down suction causes the plow to penetrate to proper depth when pulled forward, while horizontal suction causes the plow to create the desired width of furrow. The share is a plane part with trapezoidal shape. It cuts the soil horizontally and lifts it. Common types are regular, winged-plane, bar-point, and share with mounted or welded point. The regular share conserves a good cut but is recommended on stone-free soils. The winged-plane share is used on heavy soil with a moderate amount of stones. The bar-point share can be used in extreme conditions (hard and stony soils). The use of the share with mounted point is somewhere between the last two types. Manufacturers have designed shares of various shapes (trapezium, diamond, etc.) with bolted point and wings, often separately renewable. Sometimes the share cutting edge is placed well in advance of the moldboard to reduce the pulverizing action of the soil.|$|E

2500|$|Premium {{redemption}} convertibles such as {{the majority}} of French convertibles and zero-coupon Liquid Yield Option Notes (LYONs), provide a fixed interest return at issue which is significantly (or completely) {{accounted for by the}} appreciation to the redemption price. If, however, the bonds are converted by investors before the maturity date, the issuer will have benefited by having issued the bonds on a low or even zero-coupon. [...] The higher the premium redemption price, (1) the more the <b>shares</b> <b>have</b> to travel for conversion to take place before the maturity date, and (2) the lower the conversion premium has to be at issue to ensure that the conversion rights are credible.|$|E
2500|$|Where <b>shares</b> <b>have</b> been shorted and {{the company}} that issues the shares {{distributes}} a dividend, the question arises as to who receives the dividend. The new buyer of the shares, who is the holder of record and holds the shares outright, receives the dividend from the company. However, the lender, who may hold its shares in a margin account with a prime broker and {{is unlikely to be}} aware that these particular shares are being lent out for shorting, also expects to receive a dividend. [...] The short seller therefore pays the lender an amount equal to the dividend to compensate—though technically, as this payment does not come from the company, it is not a dividend. The short seller is therefore said to be short the dividend.|$|E
2500|$|Short selling {{is a form}} of {{speculation}} that allows a trader to take a [...] "negative position" [...] in a stock of a company. [...] Such a trader first [...] "borrows" [...] shares of that stock from their owner (the lender), typically via a bank or a prime broker under the condition that he will return it on demand. Next, the trader sells the borrowed shares and delivers them to the buyer who becomes their new owner. [...] The buyer is typically unaware that the <b>shares</b> <b>have</b> been sold short: his transaction with the trader proceeds just as if the trader owned rather than borrowed the shares. Some time later, the trader closes his short position by purchasing the same number of shares in the market and returning them to the lender.|$|E

2500|$|With many US {{retailers}} {{expanding into}} Canada, including competitor Express, and fast fashion {{stores such as}} H and Zara gaining market share, Le Château relaunched their brand in 2012.

The rebranding was complete with a new logo and new white, sterile, more upscale stores, with nickel fixtures and glass shelving. Known for their tailored and form-fitting clothes, it sells formal wear, casual wear, evening wear, and footwear. Le Chateau now has over 240 stores in Canada. [...] While Le Château is publicly traded, the company is tightly held with 67% of shares owned by Silverstone, the company's board, executives and two institutional investors.

2500|$|One {{variant of}} selling short {{involves}} a long position. [...] "Selling short against the box" [...] consists of holding a long position {{on which the}} <b>shares</b> <b>have</b> already risen, whereupon one then enters a short sell order for {{an equal number of}} shares. The term box alludes to the days when a safe deposit box was used to store (long) shares. [...] The purpose of this technique is to lock in paper profits on the long position without having to sell that position (and possibly incur taxes if said position has appreciated). Once the short position has been entered, it serves to balance the long position taken earlier. Thus, from that point in time, the profit is locked in (less brokerage fees and short financing costs), regardless of further fluctuations in the underlying share price. For example, one can ensure a profit in this way, while delaying sale until the subsequent tax year.|$|E
