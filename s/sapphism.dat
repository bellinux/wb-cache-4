50|$|Before {{the last}} decades of the 19th century words like uranism, homosexual, <b>sapphism,</b> lesbian and {{transvestite}} didn't exist. Being called a true Sappho of Lesbos was a high compliment for female poets, without sexual connotations. Words like sodomy, pederast and hermaphrodite existed and had their Dutch-language counterpart, but only very partially covered what would become LGBT (Dutch equivalent: holebi) in a more modern understanding. Generally the older terms, most of all sodomy, had a negative connotation. Writing about these topics was usually either pornographic or in terms of condemnable (religious) sin. From the 19th century these subjects were also more often treated in medical science, {{which led to the}} more modern terminology.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{her return}} to Korea, Gong began working as a model. She {{appeared}} in advertisements, notably the [...] "Happy to Death" [...] commercial for telecom 700-5425. After {{a year and a}} half of modeling, she made her acting debut in a supporting role in Memento Mori. Co-directed by Kim Tae-yong and Min Kyu-dong, the horror film reinvented its genre with its fresh approach on teenage femme sexuality and its destructive force, melding <b>sapphism</b> and the supernatural at a girls high school. Although it was not a box office hit in 1999, the film is frequently cited by young Korean filmmakers and cinema fans as a modern-day classic. At first Gong wasnt serious about acting and couldnt wait for filming to be over, but Memento Moris critical success encouraged her to continue acting, and she followed that with a role in 2000 sitcom My Funky Family.|$|E

40|$|Comparative {{studies of}} British and French {{literature}} have {{paid little attention}} to <b>sapphism</b> even though critics have long defined {{the difference between the two}} national literatures as sexual, particularly with respect to the novel. For most comparatists the sexual difference between nineteenth-century British and French literature is exclusively heterosexual: against the staid British novel of courtship throbs the French novel of adultery. But the lack of any British counterpart to the <b>sapphism</b> that thrived in France shows that the difference between the two literatures is also homosexual. With respect to heterosexuality, nineteenth-century French and British novels offer a contrast between two kinds of presence; with respect to <b>sapphism,</b> the contrast is between presence and absence. It would thus seem that the critic who compares nineteenth-century French and British <b>sapphism</b> is in the paradoxical position of comparing something to nothing...|$|E
40|$|With queer {{theory and}} gender studies, the {{knowledge}} that Virginia Woolf was probably bisexual {{has come to the}} forefront of scholarship concerning the writer and her works. With queer theory has come an interest in <b>Sapphism,</b> a term evoking Sappho, the only female lyric poet for whom any poetry remains. Sappho’s poetry reveals her to be a “lesbian”: a woman expressing homoerotic feelings for other women. The word Sapphist has become interchangeable with the word lesbian, and Virginia Woolf has been proven to be a Sapphist in that sense; however, <b>Sapphism</b> as a literary philosophy has remained untouched by scholars. In the following composition, I examinine reflections of Sappho’s themes, motifs, and symbols such as the chora and male interruption, to then argue that literary <b>Sapphism</b> as it exists in the fragments, is also present in Virginia Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, A Room of One’s Own, and The Waves. ...|$|E

40|$|ENG) The {{primary focus}} of this thesis is on the {{elements}} of <b>Sapphism</b> (lesbianism) and gender as present in the Virginia Woolf novels Mrs Dalloway and Orlando: A Biography, {{as well as the}} novel The Well of Loneliness by Radclyffe Hall. It also includes information about the authors' backgrounds that bear some relevance to the queer aspects of their work. The interpretation of the aforementioned text is mostly done through a queer and transfeminist and intersectional feminist lens (the author being a transgender woman), although some time is spent arguing with the past interpretations by lesbian feminists and literary critics who, in the author's opinion, intentionally erased or accidentally overlooked relevant information that would make some of the texts not qualify as works of lesbian fiction. This thesis challenges the idea that Clarissa Dalloway is somehow a closeted lesbian who was forced by society to give up on her romantic relationship with Sally Seton and was made to agree to a heterosexual marriage. While the text does suggest that she was not able to further pursue and deepen her relationships with Sally and some other women, {{in large part because of}} social norms regarding same-gender relationships, there is not enough textual evidence to support that Clarissa is a lesbian, especially [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The famous legend that Queen Victoria {{denied the}} {{existence}} of lesbianism may not be true, but {{for hundreds of years}} love and sex between women in Britain has been largely downplayed or invisible. Now, for the first time, the stories of women who desired other women are told in a revealing narrative sweep of 500 years, from the cross-dressers of Tudor England to the Lesbian Avengers of twenty-first century activism. " "Over those years, British attitudes towards women's same-sex desire underwent many transformations and women found many different ways to express their love for each other. Negotiating historical events (such as the outbreak of wars or changes in property law), the 'female husbands' of the eighteenth century, the 'Romantic Friends' of the nineteenth and the 'New Women' of the twentieth all forged new lesbian identities. Their shared history is made up of individual voices. Some are famous, such as Radclyffe Hall, whose novel The Well of Loneliness was banned for obscenity, or Virginia Woolf, whose love affair with Vita Sackville-West produced Orlando. Others are little-known, but equally eloquent. The recent discovery of the sexually explicit diaries of the Yorkshirewoman Anne Lister has thrown a totally new light on early Victorian lesbian lives.
