50|$|N-2-(5-pyridiniovaleroylthio)benzoylsulfacetamide bromide (referred to as {{compound}} 45) is a pyridinioalkanoyl thiolester {{that can}} {{function as a}} zinc ejector. Once activated with <b>silver,</b> <b>compound</b> 45 uses its pyridinioalkanoyl groups to covalently modify NCp7, specifically altering cysteines 36 and 49 on the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger. It ejects the zinc from the zinc binding sites in a two steps.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Silver</b> <b>compounds</b> {{have been}} used for their medical {{properties}} for centuries and in dentistry for more than a century. The aim of this review is to examine the evidence supporting the therapeutic use of silver in dentistry and the outcomes from the clinical trials, as well as mode of action and biocompatibility. DATA SOURCES: Literature was searched using the PubMed database between the year 1966 and 2011, with principle key terms such as 'Silver Nitrate', 'Silver Fluoride', 'Silver Diammine Fluoride', 'Silver compounds' and 'Dental caries'. Hand searching was performed for relevant papers cited in the indices back to the year 1905. RESULTS: In vitro, in vivo and clinical evidence have demonstrated that <b>silver</b> <b>compounds</b> are viable agents for preventing and arresting caries both in the primary and permanent dentition; however they are associated with adverse tooth discolouration and some reports that pulp irritation may occur. Further research has investigated its effectiveness as a dentine desensitiser, root canal disinfectant and even in silver impregnated restorative materials. The mode of action of <b>silver</b> <b>compounds</b> on carious tooth tissues is thought to include inhibition of the demineralization process, as well as an anti-bacterial effect by interference of bacterial cell membranes, cytoplasmic enzymes and inhibition of bacterial DNA replication. CONCLUSION: <b>Silver</b> <b>compounds</b> {{have been shown to be}} an effective anti-caries agent; however, there is an incomplete understanding of how <b>silver</b> <b>compounds</b> prevent caries. Further research is required to help identify its most efficacious use and limitations. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|In {{animals and}} humans chronic intake of silver {{products}} commonly leads to gradual accumulation of <b>silver</b> <b>compounds</b> {{in various parts of}} the body. As in photography (where silver is useful because of its sensitivity to light), exposure of pale or colourless <b>silver</b> <b>compounds</b> to sunlight decomposes them to silver metal or silver sulfides. Commonly these products deposit as microscopic particles in the skin, in effect a dark pigment. This condition is known as argyria or argyrosis.|$|R

50|$|The second book, with Ronald Wilfred Gurney, On the Physical Chemistry of Solids {{was more}} diverse. It treated notably of the {{oxidation}} of metals at low temperatures, where it described {{the growth of}} the oxide layer as due to the electric field developed between the metal and absorbed oxygen ions, which could force the way of metallic or oxygen ions through a disordered oxide layer. The book also analysed the photographic reactions in ionic <b>silver</b> <b>compound</b> in terms of precipitation of silver ions into metallic clusters.|$|E
5000|$|Native silver {{occurs as}} {{elongated}} dendritic coatings or irregular masses. It may also occur as cubic, octahedral, or dodecahedral crystals. It may occur alloyed with gold as electrum. It often occurs with silver sulfide and sulfosalt minerals. [...] Various amalgams {{of silver and}} mercury or other metals and mercury do occur rarely as minerals in nature. An example is the mineral eugenite (Ag11Hg2) and related forms. [...] Silver nuggets, wires, and grains are relatively common, {{but there are also}} a large number of <b>silver</b> <b>compound</b> minerals owing to silver being more reactive than gold.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{is used in}} {{numerous}} applications other than as currency, such as solar panels, water filtration, jewellery, ornaments, high-value tableware and utensils (hence the term silverware), and as an investment medium (coins and bullion) Silver is used industrially in electrical contacts and conductors, in specialized mirrors, window coatings, and in catalysis of chemical reactions. <b>Silver</b> <b>compounds</b> are used in photographic film and X-rays. Dilute silver nitrate solutions and other <b>silver</b> <b>compounds</b> are used as disinfectants and microbiocides (oligodynamic effect), added to bandages and wound-dressings, catheters, and other medical instruments.|$|R

50|$|The {{object to}} be gilded is coated, immersed, or packed in a {{suitable}} acid or salt. These chemicals then attack the metallic copper and {{silver in the}} object's surface, transforming it to various copper and <b>silver</b> <b>compounds.</b> The object is usually heated to make the etching process more efficient. Regardless, the resulting copper and <b>silver</b> <b>compounds</b> can {{be removed from the}} object's surface by a number of processes. Washing, chemical leaching, heating, or even physical absorption by porous materials such as brick dust have all been used. However, the relatively inert gold remains behind, unaffected. The result is a thin layer of nearly pure gold {{on the surface of the}} original object.|$|R
5000|$|Type 1 {{photosensitive}} anodized aluminum is anodized aluminum {{that has}} been impregnated with a <b>silver</b> <b>compound</b> which, when exposed to a light source, creates an activated latent image. [...] Upon development and fixing a black, silver-based image is formed inside of the metal. Type 1 photosensitive anodized aluminum is then sealed in boiling water similarly to common anodized aluminum. Sealing hydrates the aluminum oxide surface, trapping the image beneath the anodized layer. The combined benefits of UV stability and the high image resolution of silver photography along with the abrasion and corrosion resistance of anodized aluminum are used to advantage in applications where permanent product identification is critical such as equipment nameplates, IUID barcode labels, outdoor signage, safety/warning plates, machine control panels and fine art.|$|E

5000|$|Silver {{and most}} <b>silver</b> <b>compounds</b> have an {{oligodynamic}} effect and are toxic for bacteria, algae, and fungi in vitro. The antibacterial action of silver {{is dependent on}} the silver ion. The effectiveness of <b>silver</b> <b>compounds</b> as an antiseptic is based on the ability of the biologically active silver ion (...) to irreversibly damage key enzyme systems in the cell membranes of pathogens. The antibacterial action of silver has long been known to be enhanced by the presence of an electric field. Applying an electric current across silver electrodes enhances antibiotic action at the anode, likely due to the release of silver into the bacterial culture. The antibacterial action of electrodes coated with silver nanostructures is greatly improved in the presence of an electric field.|$|R

40|$|<b>Silver</b> <b>compounds</b> {{have become}} popular for the {{treatment}} of arresting dental caries and dentine hypersensitivity. This study investigated the interaction of <b>silver</b> <b>compounds</b> in demineralised dentine under different conditions. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), ion chromatography (IC) and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) were used to analyse these interactions. A systematically-approached literature review was conducted on <b>silver</b> <b>compounds</b> in dentistry. They have been demonstrated to be effective for preventing and arresting caries, as well dentine desensitivity. The mode of action of <b>silver</b> <b>compounds</b> on carious teeth includes inhibition of demineralisation process and anti-bacterial effect. Reaction products of Silver Diammine Fluoride (SDF) on dentine in different saliva substitutes were determined. Dentine samples were stored in deionised water (DIW), non-protein artificial saliva (NPAS), basal medium mucin (BMM), and un-stimulated whole saliva (UWS). These samples were chemically demineralised. Afterwards 38 wt-% SDF was applied. Dentine surfaces were analysed by SEM and showed different surface deposits and coatings. EDX, XPS and XRD detected metallic <b>silver</b> and <b>silver</b> <b>compounds</b> (predominantly AgCl) were formed and the amount was highest in NPAS group. BMM and UWS groups showed similar reactions. Sulphur was detected only in BMM and UWS groups. Chemical composition of BMM and UWS were determined by IC. Dentine samples were pre-saturated with BMM, UWS and DIW and then chemically demineralised. Either of 42 wt-% AgNO 3, 22 wt-% AgF and 38 wt-% SDF was applied. Treated samples were replaced in their respective “saliva”. The exposed surface and a cross-section of dentine was analysed by quantitative EDX. A precise linear relation of the silver standard wires (wt-%) according to EDX counts was obtained (R 2 > 0. 99). The amount of silver was concentrated between 0 to 60 μm in depth. BMM groups yielded the highest amount of silver for AgF and AgNO 3 compounds (p < 0. 06), which {{may be related to the}} greater concentration of salivary protein and chloride in BMM solution. ICP-MS was used to quantitatively determine silver present on SDF-treated dentine. Dentine samples were pre-saturated with BMM or UWS and chemically demineralised. Afterwards 10 wt-%, 24 wt-% or 38 wt-% of SDF was applied and the treated samples were re-placed with respective “saliva” daily for 5 days. Dentine samples were then digested in 70 % HNO 3 and silver concentration was determined by ICP. For UWS, silver was in proportion to the application of various concentrations of SDF. However, for BMM, the higher amount of silver at 10 wt-% and 38 wt-% SDF suggests an interaction effect with excessive salivary protein and chloride. Reaction products of <b>silver</b> <b>compounds</b> on dentine can be determined by the combined SEM-EDX, XPS and XRD techniques. Both modified SEM-EDX and ICP techniques are qualified for quantitative comparison of silver concentration between treatment groups. The interaction effects of silver with different in vitro salivary components should be considered in future investigations as this may affect the chemical reaction outcomes. published_or_final_versionDentistryDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Staphylococcus aureus, {{the main}} cause of {{nosocomial}} infection worldwide result in significant increases in mortality, morbidity, and cost related to prolong treatments. <b>Silver</b> <b>compound</b> has been in use since time immemorial for the treatment of burns, wounds and several other bacterial infections. In the present work, we explore the antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) dispersion (5 - 10 nm) against reference strain and clinical isolates of Methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), and Methicillin-Resistant S. aureus (MRSA). The typical minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against standard reference strain as well as, MSSA and MRSA were observed in the range of 12 - 48 µg/ml and 12 - 96 µg/ml, respectively. The MBC/MIC ratios against all strains were found in the range of ≤ 1 to ≤ 4, which shows that Ag-NPs inhibit bacterial growth in a bactericidal rather than a bacteriostatic manner. Our finding suggests that Ag-NPs are effective broad-spectrum antibacterial agents regardless of their drug-resistance mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|The {{advent of}} printed {{electronics}} {{has shown the}} incessant requirement for the reduction of printed features less than tens of micrometers, where conventional printing technologies have not easily reached. To augment the resolution and registration capabilities of conventional printing technologies, surface energy patterning techniques have been explored. However, they require additional pre-patterning processes to differentiate regions with low or high surface energy and do not completely prevent electrical defects, which frequently occur when conducting ink coalesces across two adjacent electrodes. In addition, they do not provide an appropriate solution to precisely place the channel electrode between them. In this study, novel fabrication techniques for the self-patterning of two adjacent electrodes {{without the aid of}} surface energy patterning and the self-registration of the channel electrode between them have been demonstrated by exploiting the chemical and optical traits of an organic <b>silver</b> <b>compound</b> in conjunction with polyaniline. It is found that the combination of self-patterning and self-registration techniques could form two adjacent electrodes as narrow as 13. 3 ± 1. 5 µm and precisely place the channel electrode between them.

40|$|Silver-resistant mutants were {{selected}} by stepwise exposure of silver-susceptible clinical strains of Escherichia coli, {{two of which}} did not contain any plasmids, to either silver nitrate or silver sulfadiazine. These mutants showed complete cross-resistance to both compounds. They showed low-level cross-resistance to cephalosporins and HgCl 2 but not to other heavy metals. The Ag-resistant mutants had decreased outer membrane (OM) permeability to cephalosporins, and all five resistant mutants tested were deficient in major porins, either OmpF or OmpF plus OmpC. However, the well-studied OmpF- and/or OmpC-deficient mutants of laboratory strains K- 12 and B/r were not resistant to either <b>silver</b> <b>compound.</b> Resistant strains accumulated up to fourfold less (110 m) AgNO 3 than the parental strains. The treatment of cells with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone increased Ag accumulation in Ag-susceptible and -resistant strains, suggesting that even the wild-type Ag-susceptible strains had an endogenous Ag efflux activity, which occurred at higher levels in Ag-resistant mutants. The addition of glucose as an energy source to starved cells activated the efflux of Ag.

However, silver fluoride and silver nitrate are caustic and can cause tissue damage, resulting in gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, falling blood pressure, cramps, paralysis, and respiratory arrest. Animals repeatedly dosed with silver salts have been observed to experience anaemia, slowed growth, necrosis of the liver, and fatty degeneration of the liver and kidneys; rats implanted with silver foil or injected with colloidal silver have been observed to develop localised tumours. Parenterally admistered colloidal silver causes acute silver poisoning. Some waterborne species are particularly sensitive to silver salts {{and those of the}} other precious metals; in most situations, however, silver does not pose serious environmental hazards.|$|R
