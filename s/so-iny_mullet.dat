50|$|The so-iuy mullet (Liza haematocheilus), {{also known}} as the haarder, redlip mullet or <b>so-iny</b> <b>mullet,</b> is a species of fish in the family Mugilidae.|$|E
40|$|Background: Interleukin- 22 (IL- 22) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the regulation of immune responses. However, little is known about its function or structure in fish. Results: The IL- 22 gene was first cloned from <b>So-iny</b> <b>mullet</b> (Liza haematocheila), one of commercially important fish species in China. Then, 3 -D structure model of the mullet IL- 22 was constructed by comparative modeling method using human IL- 22 (1 M 4 R) as template, and a 5 ns molecular dynamics (MD) was studied. The open reading frame (ORF) of mullet IL- 22 cDNA was 555 bp, encoding 184 amino acids. The mullet IL- 22 shared higher identities with the other fish IL- 22 homologs and possessed a conserved IL- 10 signature motif at its C-terminal. The mullet IL- 22 model possessed six conserved helix structure. PROCHECK, SAVES and Molprobity server analysis confirmed that this model threaded well with human IL- 22. Strikingly, analysis with CastP, cons-PPISP server suggested that the cysteines in mullet IL- 22 might not be involved in the forming of disulfide bond for structural stabilization, but related to protein-protein interactions. Conclusions: The structure of IL- 22 in <b>So-iny</b> <b>mullet</b> (Liza haematocheila) was constructed using comparative modeling method which provide more information for studying the function of fish IL- 22...|$|E
