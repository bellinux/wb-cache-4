40|$|AbstractEffect of <b>small</b> <b>size</b> on {{dispersion}} characteristics of waves in multi-walled carbon nanotubes is investigated using an elastic shell model. Dynamic governing equations {{of the carbon}} nanotube are formulated {{on the basis of}} nonlocal elastic theory. The relationship between wavenumber and frequency of wave propagation is obtained from the solution of the eigenvalue equations. The numerical results show that the {{dispersion characteristics}} of wave in the multi-walled carbon nanotube are affected by the <b>small</b> <b>size.</b> Effect of <b>small</b> <b>size</b> is not obvious for the smaller wavenumber, and it will arise and increase gradually with the increase of the wavenumber. Effect of the <b>small</b> <b>size</b> will decrease as the inner radius of carbon nanotubes increases. In addition, the explicit expressions of the cut-off frequencies are derived.

40|$|Simulations {{have been}} {{performed}} to investigate the impact of radial variation of neutral atoms (neutral puff) on the edge plasma of <b>small</b> <b>size</b> divertor tokamak. It was demonstrated that, the variation of neutral atoms (neutral puff) in edge plasma of <b>small</b> <b>size</b> divertor tokamak generates additional large radial electric field and large radial electric field shear near separatrix which can significantly influence global confinement by affecting the transition from low (L) to high (H) confinement. This simulation was performed by using B 2 SOLPS 0. 5. 2 D fluid transport code based on a reduced form of the transport form of transport equations. These transport equations are implemented in B 2 SOLPS 0. 5. 2 D fluid transport code and solved for the parameters of <b>Small</b> <b>Size</b> Divertor tokamak. The results of simulation by fluid transport B 2 SOLPS 0. 5. 2 D code can be summarized as follow: 1) The Plasma Parameters are significantly effect by neutral atoms puffing in the edge plasma of <b>small</b> <b>size</b> divertor tokamak; 2) Contrary to previous expectation [1] of the predominant role of neutral viscosity on toroidal flux, anomalous transport {{was found to be}} mainly effect on toroidal flux; 3) Puffing of gas (neutral) in the edge plasma of <b>small</b> <b>size</b> divertor tokamak produce strong ITB; 4) Puffing of gas (neutral) in the edge plasma of <b>small</b> <b>size</b> divertor increase plasma density especially in SOL through charge exchange and ionization processes; 5) Puffing of gas (neutral) in the edge plasma of <b>small</b> <b>size</b> divertor has significant effect on the distribution of plasma heat flux; 6) The radial electric field is affected by gas (neutral) puffing in the edge plasma of <b>small</b> <b>size</b> divertor; 7) Puffing of neutral (atoms) in the edge plasma of <b>small</b> <b>size</b> divertor tokamak produce large radial electric field shear which contribute to L-H transition; 8) The centrifugal effect has no influence on distribution of the radial profile of parallel (toroidal) velocity of edge plasma of <b>small</b> <b>size</b> divertor tokamak during gas (neutral) puffing; 9) The bootstrap current in edge plasma of <b>small</b> <b>size</b> divertor tokamak is significantly affected by gas (neutral) puffing...|$|R

25|$|In the Caucasus, jackals mainly hunt hares, small rodents, pheasants, partridges, ducks, coots, moorhens and passerines. They readily eat lizards, snakes, frogs, fish, {{molluscs}} and insects. During {{the winter}} period, they will kill many nutrias and waterfowl. During such times, jackals will surplus kill and cache {{what they do}} not eat. Jackals will feed on fruits such as pears, hawthorn, dogwood and the cones of Common Medlars. European jackals tend not to be as damaging to livestock as wolves and red foxes are, though they can become a serious nuisance to <b>small</b> <b>sized</b> stock when in high numbers.

25|$|Mining, {{manufacturing}} and construction {{accounts for about}} 39% of the GDP, with manufacturing alone accounting for 32%. This has remained steady {{for the past few}} decades. Minerals is one of the state’s two main natural resources. Mining is a traditional economic activity for the state. There are ten mining districts in the Sierra Gorda alone producing lead, silver, zinc, copper, gold, mercury and antimony. Nonmetallic products include marble, kaolin, sandstone, and more. Opals are a distinctive state resource. State and local governments, in partnership with private industry, actively promote foreign investment into the region. The priority of the state government is to encourage industries which use low levels of water for environmental reasons. These have mostly been auto parts, food processing and electronics. Other major industries include chemicals, plastics, textiles, paper products and printing and wood products. Most are micro and <b>small</b> <b>sized</b> operations.|$|E

A comparison between the flextensioanl transducer with slotted shell and the Class flextensional transducer was made. The maximum size of the shell is 200 mm. The transmitting voltage response of the transducer reaches to 131 dB with resonant frequency 600 Hz in water.

25|$|The new {{minister}} {{found himself}} {{at odds with}} the political establishment over the issue of land redistribution: promised by Ion I. C. Brătianu's National Liberal (PNL) government during World War I, and partly carried out in December 1918, the move viewed as incomplete - expropriations had not led to a redefinition of peasant property, and land had remained with provisional cooperatives instead of being allocated to members. Mihalache supported the fragmentation of all land property in a country of medium to <b>small</b> <b>sized</b> landowners. The Peasants' Party calculated leaving no landowner with more than on one square kilometre, which also included expropriating land for common pasture. At the same time, Vaida-Voevod's government created a conflict over its projects for constitutional reform, clashing with the PNL over the highly centralized government and support for the 1866 Constitution of Romania advocated by the latter. Mihalache is also known to have traveled incognito to various locations, as a means to observe first-hand abuse by government officials.|$|E
25|$|The visual {{ability of}} {{birds of prey}} is legendary, and the keenness of their {{eyesight}} {{is due to a}} variety of factors. Raptors have large eyes for their size, 1.4 times greater than the average for birds of the same weight, and the eye is tube-shaped to produce a larger retinal image. The resolving power of an eye depends both on the optics, large eyes with large appertures suffers less from diffraction and can have larger retinal images due to a long focal length, and on the density of receptor spacing. The retina has a large number of receptors per square millimeter, which determines the degree of visual acuity. The more receptors an animal has, the higher its ability to distinguish individual objects at a distance, especially when, as in raptors, each receptor is typically attached to a single ganglion. Many raptors have foveas with far more rods and cones than the human fovea (65,000/mm2 in American kestrel, 38,000 in humans) and this provides these birds with spectacular long distance vision. It is proposed that the shape of the deep central fovea of raptors can create a telephoto optical system, increasing the size of the retinal image in the fovea and thereby increasing the spatial resolution. Behavioural studies show that some large eyed raptors (Wedge-tailed eagle, Old world vultures) and have ca 2 times higher spatial resolution than humans, but many medium and <b>small</b> <b>sized</b> raptors have comparable or lower spatial resolution.|$|E
