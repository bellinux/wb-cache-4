40|$|International audienceTo {{understand}} the reported difference between double band, sarcomeric <b>second</b> harmonic <b>generation</b> pattern of isolated myofibril and predominant single band pattern found in thick muscle tissues, we studied {{the effect of}} myofibril preparation on the <b>second</b> harmonic <b>generation</b> pattern. We found that double band sarcomeric <b>second</b> harmonic <b>generation</b> pattern usually observed in myofibrils (prepared from fresh tissue) is due to muscle alteration during the mixing and triton treatment processes. Single band sarcomeric <b>second</b> harmonic <b>generation</b> pattern could be observed in isolated myofibrils when this alteration is previously prevented using paraformaldehyd fixed tissue. We conclude that single band sarcomeric <b>second</b> harmonic <b>generation</b> pattern is a signature of adult muscle myofibrils in normal physiological condition, suggesting that sarcomeric <b>second</b> harmonic <b>generation</b> patterns {{could be used as}} a valuable diagnosis tool of muscle health...|$|R

5|$|Rivalry came {{predominantly}} {{from the}} Ford Falcon—also locally built. Prior to the <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> Commodore of 1988, the Holden was positioned a full class below the full-size Falcon. To varying degrees, competition also came from mid-size offerings from Toyota Australia {{as well as}} Chrysler Australia, which morphed into Mitsubishi Motors Australia. Moreover, between 1989 and 1997, Australian federal government policy saw {{the launch of the}} Toyota Lexcen, which was a rebadged version of the <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> Commodore. With the introduction of the third generation in 1997, Holden implemented its largest export programs involving Commodore and its derivatives. In the Middle East, South Africa and Brazil, the Commodore sold as a Chevrolet. High-performance export versions followed in North America, sold as Pontiac and later Chevrolet. HSV also exported to the United Kingdom as Vauxhall, in the Middle East as Chevrolet Special Vehicles (CSV) and in New Zealand and Singapore as HSV.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} <b>second</b> {{harmonic}} <b>generation</b> {{can be enhanced}} by Fano resonant coupling of asymmetric plasmonic metal nanostructures. We develop a theoretical model examining the effects of electromagnetic interaction between two metal nanostructures on the <b>second</b> harmonic <b>generation.</b> We compare the <b>second</b> harmonic <b>generation</b> efficiency of a single plasmonic metal nanostructure with that of two coupled ones. We show that <b>second</b> harmonic <b>generation</b> from a single metal nanostructure can be enhanced about 30 times by attaching a second metal nanostructure with a 10 times higher quality factor {{than that of the}} first one. The origin of this enhancement is Fano resonant coupling of the two metal nanostructures. We support our findings on Fano enhancement of <b>second</b> harmonic <b>generation</b> by an experimental study of a coupled plasmonic system composed of a silver nanoparticle and a silver nanowire on glass surface in which the ratio of the quality factors are also estimated to be around 10 times...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This study {{looks into}} intergenerational use of {{language}} in the Malay community of Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The first and <b>second</b> <b>generations</b> have managed {{to hold on to}} Malay while adopting Arabic, but this seems to be a transitional stage before a total shift takes place to Arabic in the third generation. This shift has also influenced the attitude of the speakers, i. e. while the first and <b>second</b> <b>generations</b> still consider themselves Malays, the third generation refers to themselves as Arabs. Another process of change is taking place, and that is a reversal to the ancestral language with the hope of returning to the original homeland, due to the selective policy of the host government in awarding citizenship to foreign settlers...|$|R
