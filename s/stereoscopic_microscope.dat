Once divided into follicular unit grafts, the surgeon implants each unit is individually inserted into small recipient sites made by an incision in the bald scalp. In the newer technique, roots are extracted from the donor area and divided into strips for transplantation. The strip, two to three millimeters thick, is isolated and transplanted to the bald scalp. After surgery, a bandage is worn for two days to protect the stitched strip during healing. A small strip scar remains after healing, which can be covered by scalp hair growing over the scar.|$|E
5000|$|Tools {{to detect}} {{oil and gas}} have been {{evolving}} for over a century. The simplest and most direct tool is well cuttings examination. Some older oilmen ground the cuttings between their teeth and tasted to see if crude oil was present. Today, a wellsite geologist or mudlogger uses a low powered <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>microscope</b> to determine the lithology of the formation being drilled and to estimate porosity and possible oil staining. A portable ultraviolet light chamber or [...] "Spook Box" [...] is {{used to examine the}} cuttings for fluorescence. Fluorescence can be an indication of crude oil staining, or of the presence of fluorescent minerals. They can be differentiated by placing the cuttings in a solvent filled watchglass or dimple dish. The solvent is usually carbon tetrachlorethane. Crude oil dissolves and then redeposits as a fluorescent ring when the solvent evaporates. The written strip chart recording of these examinations is called a sample log or mudlog.|$|E
50|$|The {{examination}} of the Nahal Hemar artifacts included: 1. All the plaster statue fragments and plaster beads were examined under a Wild M-8 <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>microscope</b> under oblique illumination. This was used in order to roughly define the homogeneity of the samples. 2. Tiny lumps of plaster {{were removed from the}} items on several locations using a diamonds saw, spatulas, and fine drills bits. Chips with the film casting pigments were sampled in several cases for chemical analyses of straining materials. They used broken artifacts in most cases to prevent further damage to the remaining artifacts. 3. Bulk samples were subjected to Thin-Section Petrographic Analysis (TSPA). 4. Mineralogical analyses of the non calcareous components were carried out to more samples, in which the admixture of clay was observed by the TSPA analysis. The samples were powdered and soaked in 3% HCl to remove the carbonate ingredients and the clay mineralogy was determined by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). 5. Chemical analyses were done on most samples using Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES). The benefit of this method is that it has high accuracy with low limits of detection. 6. Small lumps that were coated with yellow, green, red, or dark pigments were removed from the plaster statue and beads and used for X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) analysis, which provided a chemical definition of the pigment materials.|$|E

Objective: Evaluate the efficacy of the isolation of Langerhans islets from dogs, by means of mechanical-enzymatic separation technique with stationary digestion using collagenase, and purification with a discontinuous dextran density gradient. Methods: The counting of islet numbers and evaluation of their sizes was accomplished by staining with diphenylthiocarbazone and using <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>microscopes</b> equipped with eyepiece reticule for the measurement of average diameters of stained islets.

The average number of islets isolated per kg of body weight showed significant correlation with body weight and weight of the pancreas resected.

30|$|This study {{observed}} the air-drying of self-etching primer using the MoraVision™ 2 3 D video microscope system. This system has two main components: MoraScope™ and MoraVu 3 D™. The MoraScope {{is made of}} two self-contained digital <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>microscopes</b> in one housing. It combines two zoom stereo microscopes and their high definition (HD) video cameras into one compact (applox. 13  cm) cube to provide magnification levels from 0.5 to 30 × [37]. The MoraVu 3 D is a real time stereoscopic display module. 3 D real-time images are projected to the liquid crystal display (LCD) monitor when the dentist and their dental assistants wear 3 D glasses [38]. With typical microscopes, {{it is necessary to}} illuminate the surgical field with a high intensity LED light source when the expanded surgical field of view is used, because the high magnification images are darker than the normal images. Since restorative composite material will be polymerized by the LED illuminator, it is impossible to spend a long time shaping and contouring the composite restoration under the expanded surgical microscope field. On the other hand, MoraVision 2 microscope can project a clear image even with relatively weak illumination. Therefore, in a clinical situation, it is possible to spend more time shaping the anatomical contours under the expanded operating view.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{measure and}} {{compensate}} for soft tissue deformation during imageguided neurosurgery, {{we have developed}} a novel approach to estimate the threedimensional (3 -D) topology of the cortical surface and track its motion over time. METHODS: We use stereopsis to estimate the 3 -D cortical topology during neurosurgical procedures. To facilitate this process, two charge-coupled device cameras have been attached to the binocular optics of a <b>stereoscopic</b> operating <b>microscope.</b> Before surgery, this stereo imaging system is calibrated to obtain the extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameters. During surgery, the 3 -D shape of the cortical surface is automatically estimated from a stereo pair of images and registered to the preoperative image volume to provide navigational guidance. This estimation requires robust matching of features between the images, which, when combined with the camera calibration, yields the desired 3 -D coordinates. After the 3 -D cortical surface has been estimated from stereo pairs, its motion is tracked by comparing the current surface with its previous locations. RESULTS: We are able to estimate the 3 -D topology of the cortical surface with an average error of less than 1. 2 mm. Executing on a 1. 1 -GHz Pentium machine, the 3 -...|$|R
