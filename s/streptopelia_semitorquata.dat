5|$|The {{wide variety}} of birds in Basse Casamance was noted by early explorers. While Basse Casamance National Park and Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve have not been open for years due to the Casamance Conflict, Carabane {{has been found to}} be very conducive to ornithological observation. A study in 1998 {{discovered}} the following species on the island: African darter (Anhinga rufa), Goliath heron (Ardea goliath), palm-nut vulture (Gypohierax angolensis), black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), Caspian tern (Sterna caspia), blue-spotted wood-dove (Turtur afer), red-eyed dove (<b>Streptopelia</b> <b>semitorquata),</b> white-rumped swift (Apus caffer), woodland kingfisher (Halcyon senegalensis), grey-backed camaroptera (Camaroptera brachyura), red-bellied paradise-flycatcher (Terpsiphone rufiventer), pied crow (Corvus albus), black-rumped waxbill (Estrilda troglodytres) and yellow-fronted canary (Serinus mozambicus).|$|E

40|$|Linear {{measurements}} and derived indices from striated trypanosomas in nine species of sub-Saharan birds representing seven {{families of the}} Passeriformes, were compared. The dimensions of the striated trypomastigotes from the Carduelinae, Estrildidae, Nectarinidae, Passeridae, Pycnonotidae, Turdinae and Zosteropidae were similar {{to each other as}} well as to those of the striated trypanosomes from the boreal owl (Strigidae). All these trypanosomes were considered to be Trypanosoma avium Danilewsky, 1885. A further 20 avian species were considered to harbour T. avium, thus greatly extending the reported host range of this trypanosome. Non-striated trypanosomes from the estrildid Uraeginthus angolensis closely resembled Trypanosoma bouffardi Leger & Blanchard, 1911 in appearance and dimensions, and were considered to be of this species. Additional host records for T. bouffardi from an additional nine avian species have been reported. The uniquely small and stumpy Trypanosoma everetti Molyneux, 1973 was reported from an additional 18 avian species. A large non-striated trypanosome from the laughing dove, Streptopelia senegalensis, was identified as Trypanosoma hannae Pittaluga, 1905 and this species was re-described. An infection of this parasite was also found in a single Streptopelia capicola and a single <b>Streptopelia</b> <b>semitorquata.</b> Two trypanosomes seen in the francolin, Francolinus natalensis, were identified as Trypanosoma calmettei Mathis & Leger, 1909...|$|E
40|$|Eleven popcorn {{varieties}} {{cultivated in}} the humid forest zone of south-western Nigeria {{were subjected to}} natural infections with disease causing agents and vertebrate pest infestation. Data were taken on the incidence and severity of maize field diseases, birds and on rodents attacks. Result of the experiments reveled that all the 11 popcorn varieties were found susceptible to leaf spot diseases {{with varying degrees of}} incidence. Five out of 11 Popcorn varieties namely Mercy, Ashland, Pearl shaped, P 618 and DMRSR were found having maize rust infection. The incidence of occurrence of streak was found in New A 2, Pearl shaped and Grace, while the remaining popcorn varieties had no streak infection. The popcorn variety with the least leaf blight incidence of 12. 4 was New A 2 followed with Prayer with the incidence of 14. 6 %. There was no incidence of smut and downy mildews recorded on the popcorn varieties. The vertebrate pests found associated with popcorn include bird species such as Ploceus cucullatus (Weaverbirds), <b>Streptopelia</b> <b>semitorquata</b> (Dove) and Francolinus bicalcaratus (Bush fowl), while the rodents include species such as Xerus erythropus (Red legged Ground Squirrel), Rattus rattus (Black grey Rat), Mastomys natalensis (Multimammate Rat) and Thryonomys swinderianus (Grass cutters/Cane rats). The activities of these vertebrate pests were more significant in P 618, followed by Mercy, Yellow composite and Mixed grain...|$|E
