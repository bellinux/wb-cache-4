Finally, phenological analysis datas, were crossed with those obtained from the total seed production, with the aim of identifying the most appropriate method to define the optimal timing of harvest.

30|$|A single-plane {{osteotomy}} has {{a number}} of advantages over a wedge osteotomy: the <b>second</b> <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> a wedge osteotomy is difficult to make accurately once the bone is divided, making it easy to create a new deformity; it is possible to under-correct the original deformity; and an incorrectly created wedge can produce a bone gap. Resection of a bone wedge creates shortening that can be avoided by the use of a single-plane osteotomy. Obliquity of this single-plane osteotomy often allows stable inter-fragmentary screw fixation with compression and a large area of bone contact that is not possible with a transverse osteotomy. Translation along the plane of osteotomy allows correction of translational deformity with restoration of length. Where the surgical anatomy dictates the need for an approach to the concavity of angulation, a closing wedge may be technically challenging, whereas a single cut and rotation about a single oblique plane provides an elegant solution.|$|R

40|$|AbstractTwo field {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} the experimental station farm, faculty of agriculture, Ain Shams University at Shalakan, Kalubia Governorate, during the two growing seasons, i. e. 2009 and 2010, to investigate the response of growth and forage yield production of pearl millet cv. Shandaweel 1 to nitrogen fertilization rates and cutting height above the soil surface. Four nitrogen rates as ammonium nitrate (33. 5 %N), 0, 30, 45, and 60 kgN/fed, were arranged in the main plots and two levels of cutting heights (10 and 20 cm above the soil surface) in the subplot with four replicates in split-plot design. In the second season, nitrogen application increased up to 75 kgN/fed. The main results were as follows: Significant increases were appeared in plant height (cm), number of tillers/m 2, number of leaves/m 2, and leaf area index during the two growing seasons as nitrogen fertilization rates increased except at the third cut in the first season for plant height (cm) and number of tillers/m 2, the first and <b>second</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> the first season for number of leaves/m 2 and at the third cut during the first season of study for leaf area index, while leaf/stem ratio was not affected significantly during the two growing seasons. Green forage yield/fed was significantly increased as nitrogen application rates increased during the two growing seasons except at the third <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> the first season of study. Increasing nitrogen fertilization rates up to 75 kgN/fed caused significant increases in dry forage yield during the three collected <b>cuts</b> in the <b>second</b> season of study and the <b>second</b> <b>cut</b> during the first season of study {{as well as in}} the combined results. Plant height (cm) was significantly affected as cutting height above the soil surface increased in the <b>second</b> <b>cut</b> (2009) and the first cut (2010) where plant height increased at 10 cm as cutting height than at 20 cm above the soil surface. Significant differences were appeared in number of tillers/m 2 as cutting height varied from 10 to 20 cm in the two studied seasons. The highest <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> number of tillers/m 2 was scored at 20 cm cutting height than those at 10 cm in the <b>second</b> and third <b>cuts</b> during the two growing seasons. A number of leaves/m 2 as well as leaf area index were influenced significantly as cutting height increased during the two growing seasons except in the <b>second</b> and third <b>cuts</b> during 2009 or the third cut during 2010 for number of leaves/m 2 and in the <b>second</b> <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> the first season (2009) and the third cut during 2010 for leaf area index. Significant effects were noticed in leaf/stem ratio as cutting height differed in the <b>second</b> or third <b>cut</b> in 2009 and in the three collected cuts in combined analysis. Green forage yield, dry forage yield/feddan increase significantly as cutting height differed during the two growing seasons as well as the combined results except in the first cut during the first season of study for dry forage yield. Green forage yield as well as dry forage yield was significantly affected by the interaction between nitrogen fertilization rates and cutting height, where the highest yield was detected with adding 60 – 75 kgN/fed and 20 cm as cutting height (30. 7 ton/fed) ...|$|R

USE - The method is useful {{for analyzing}} sward and plant species make-up of sports and amenity turf in sward sample obtained from sports or amenity turf e. g. golf green, cricket playing surface, grass tennis court, bowls green and croquet green. ADVANTAGE - The method simply identifies plants growing in sports and amenity turf surfaces. Technology Focus/Extension Abstract: TECHNOLOGY FOCUS - BIOTECHNOLOGY - Preferred Method: The method involves using sward sample that is obtained from first <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> sward and/or <b>second</b> <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> sward. The <b>second</b> <b>cut</b> is performed within 24 hours <b>of</b> first <b>cut.</b> The <b>second</b> <b>cut</b> is performed at the same cutting height as first cut, or cutting height of less than 2 mm lower than first <b>cut.</b> The sample <b>of</b> sward is obtained from verticut. The method involves extracting DNA from the sample of sward within 48 hours of collection. The sample is stored in DNA extraction buffer within 48 hours of collection. The one or more genetic markers comprise one or more single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The genetic marker is ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase gene (Rbcl), section of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-plastoquinone oxidoreductase subunit 7 (ndhH), trnH-psbA spacer or trnk-r 1 spacer. The method involves analyzing the presence of one or more markers in sample, where the amount of one or more markers indicates the amount of one or more species of plant. The method involves multiplying the amount of one or more markers by a weighting factor to determine the amount of one or more species of plant, where the weighting factor of 2 - 5 determines the amount of Agrostis capillaris or A. stolonifera, weighting factor of 1 - 3 determines the amount of A. canina, Festuca ovina, F. rubra, Lolium perenne, or Poa annua, weighting factor of 1 - 2 determines the amount of P. pratensis, or weighting factor of 1 - 5 determines the amount of Holcus lanat...|$|R

40|$|Symbiotic {{nitrogen}} fixation (SNF) in perennial legume-grass leys {{is the primary}} source of N to organic farming systems in northern countries. This work aimed to quantify SNF in organically managed red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) -grass leys and to relate SNF to explanatory variables. The study was carried out on 27 farms located in the coastal regions of Finland and included 117 ley crops subjected to regular organic farming practices. SNF was calculated from clover herbage dry-matter yield with an empirical model. In the accumulated first and <b>second</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> one- and two-year-old red clover-grass leys, SNF averaged 185. 4 kg N ha- 1 yr- 1 (SD ± 90. 0 kg N ha- 1 yr- 1); fixation in the aftermath added 62. 1 kg N ha- 1 yr- 1 (SD ± 49. 8 kg N ha- 1 yr- 1). Due to the poor persistence of red clover, SNF declined with ley age. Between- and within-field coefficients of variation of SNF in one- and two-year-old leys averaged 51. 1 and 51. 8 %, respectively. SNF was positively related to soil fertility parameters, mainly to soil structure. It is concluded that the preceding crop value of legume-grass leys needs to be assessed individually. The spatial heterogeneity of soil properties can be reduced through site-specific amelioration and regular applications of animal manure...|$|R

Except for the classic production of forage, alfalfa is very important for seed production. In our conditions Alfalfa seed are produced from the <b>second</b> <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> alfalfa.

This trial tests three different densities and four varieties {{in order to determine the}} impact on yield and quality of forage dry matter. In the year of establishment, cultivars from the treatment A 1 achieved higher yields of dry matter for 2. 3 t ha- 1 in relation to the treatment A 2.
