Another of Cleveland's architectural treasures is The Arcade (sometimes called the Old Arcade), a five-story arcade built in 1890 and renovated in 2001 as a Hyatt Regency Hotel. Cleveland's landmark ecclesiastical architecture includes the historic Old Stone Church in downtown Cleveland and the onion domed St. Theodosius Russian Orthodox Cathedral in Tremont, along with myriad ethnically inspired Roman Catholic churches. Running east from Public Square through University Circle is Euclid Avenue, which was known for its prestige and elegance.

This is a very simple axle setup, and components are relatively easy to change. Each piece, such as wheel hub, disc brake rotor, sprocket, etc., are slid onto the axle and are held in place by set screws or locking collars. The components can also be separated by bushings that are cut to the desired length. Since the axle spins, the wheel, brake, and sprocket components must be locked to the axle.

Because of this, squares have an important place in urban life. In times, squares like the other urban spaces, have showed a change according to religious beliefs, economic and politic life of society andhuman needs. In spite of this, squares, in every age, act as an important element to provide social experience and occurrence of city identity. Urban public squares provide an effective ground for human interaction and communication. Therefore, they are important to determine the social character of cities and cultural identity. Urban public squares can establish a proper stage for spontaneous social experience and multiple human relationship in a direct relation with the environment. Because of this, they provide more opportunity for social experience than a barely sheltered place of our so called modem society. In contrast to many European cities, there is not a well established public square understanding which provides social experience and gives an identity to the city in our country. Although the squares have become a necessity for our society due to rapid structural changes in Turkish social life, they are still neglected by our current urban design practices. For, this reason, this study focuses on the spatial analysis of public squares in a rapidly changing social setting. Thus the study area of " public squares" is chosen as a research topic because of its importance in our society as well as in urban design. This research also aims to address the need for public squares in our society and contains a study in an urban design project in Konak izmir through an analysis of the characteristics of the <b>square.</b> <b>KEY</b> WORDS: Square, Space, Place, Public Space, Plaza, Urban Space, Enclosure, Continuity, Diversity, Vitality, Perception, Spatial Perception...|$|E
