5|$|In late 2016, {{construction}} work commenced at the Swinefleet Drain {{end of the}} nature reserve. The {{construction work}}s include the installation and commissioning of a permanent Archimedes <b>Screw</b> <b>type</b> Pumping Station which will ensure the water level in the Peat Bog is kept at an optimum level for Peat regeneration. The principal contractor for the works was North Midland Construction PLC.|$|E
5|$|The D-1 {{howitzer}} {{was essentially}} {{a combination of the}} barrel of the 152-mm howitzer model 1938 (M-10) on the carriage of the 122-mm howitzer M1938 (M-30). Since the new carriage was lighter than that of the M-10, the barrel was fitted with a massive double-baffle muzzle brake DT-3 to soften the shock of recoil. The breech block was of interrupted <b>screw</b> <b>type,</b> the recoil system consisted of a hydraulic buffer and a hydro-pneumatic recuperator. The separately loaded ammunition included a variety of shells and eight different propellant charges in cartridges.|$|E
25|$|The Type 38 75mm Field Gun was a {{thoroughly}} conventional design for its day, complete with crew {{seats on the}} gun shield and a solid box trail. It had a hydrospring recoil system, interrupted <b>screw</b> <b>type</b> breechblock, and 1/16-inch gun shield.|$|E

30|$|Among the surfaces, {{the highest}} WR was {{obtained}} at tangential surfaces (radial direction) in both <b>screw</b> <b>types</b> and nail, whereas the transverse surface (longitudinal direction) showed the lowest withdrawal strength for screws and nail.|$|R

A panoramic sight was used for both indirect and direct fire.|$|E
25|$|The Type 38 150mm Howitzer was a {{conventional}} design for its day, complete with crew {{seats on the}} gun shield and a solid box trail. It had a hydrospring recoil system, interrupted <b>screw</b> <b>type</b> breechblock, and 1/16-inch gun shield. It {{was designed to be}} moved by a team of eight horses, but in practice, its heavy weight was a problem.|$|E
25|$|When {{using this}} convention, in {{contrast}} to the other convention, the defined handedness of the wave matches the handedness of the <b>screw</b> <b>type</b> nature of the field in space. Specifically, if one freezes a right-handed wave in time, when one curls the fingers of one’s right hand around the helix, the thumb will point in the direction which the helix progresses given that sense of rotation. Note that it is the nature of all screws and helices that it does not matter in which direction you point your thumb when determining its handedness.|$|E
30|$|The screw WR {{was found}} to be higher than the ones in the nails. Among the <b>screw</b> <b>types,</b> the highest WR was {{obtained}} for chipboard screws at all combinations of moisture content and surface.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the other}} roller <b>screw</b> <b>types</b> above, loads are {{transferred}} from the nut through the rollers to the screw (or in the reverse order). In this type of actuator, thrust bearings and a freely rotating internally grooved bearing ring transfer loads between the rollers and the nut.|$|R

30|$|In this study, the {{characteristic}} strength properties {{of a joint}} constructed with structural glulam members made of fast-grown Japanese cedar was evaluated. Four self-tapping <b>screw</b> <b>types</b> with various numbers were designated to a beam–girder connection, {{and the effect of}} assembly approaches including the face-nailing approach and toe-nailing approach on the structural joint performance were also considered.|$|R
30|$|For each default properties, {{the basic}} {{statistics}} were computed. Comparing the results between the <b>screw</b> <b>types,</b> the moisture contents and the surfaces were executed using multi-variant analyses.

50|$|A {{total of}} 640 wooden-body, bogie locomotive-hauled {{carriages}} were constructed, mostly to variants {{of the basic}} design between 1874 and 1903.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{compared}} {{the maintenance of}} tightening torque in different retention <b>screw</b> <b>types</b> of implant-supported crowns. Materials and Methods: Twelve metallic crowns in UCLA abutments cast with cobalt-chromium alloy were attached to external hexagon osseointegrated implants with different retention screws: group A: titanium alloy retention screw; group B: gold alloy retention screw with gold coating; group C: titanium alloy retention screw with diamond-like carbon film coating; and group D: titanium alloy retention screw with aluminum titanium nitride coating. Three detorque measurements were obtained after torque insertion in each replica. Data were evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA), Tukey's test (P < 0. 05), and t test (P < 0. 05). Results: Detorque value reduced in all groups (P < 0. 05). Group A retained {{the highest percentage of}} torque in comparison with the other groups (P < 0. 05). Groups B and D retained the lowest percentage of torque without statistically significant difference between them (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: All <b>screw</b> <b>types</b> exhibited reduction in the detorque value. The titanium screw maintained the highest percentage of torque whereas the gold-coated screw and the titanium screw with aluminum titanium nitride coating retained the lowest percentage.

40|$|Abstract. The {{structure}} of the “star ” defect in 4 H-SiC substrates {{and its effects on}} the extended defect structures in the epilayers were studied by molten KOH etching and transmission x-ray topography. Star defects consist of a center region with high densities of threading dislocations (both edge and <b>screw</b> <b>types)</b> and six arms of dislocation arrays extending along directions. In addition, multiple linear dislocation arrays extending perpendicular to the off-cut direction were observed in the epilayers. Dislocation arrays extending along directions are consistent with the slip bands generated by the prismatic slip: a/ 3 { 1 - 100 }. Bands of linear dislocation arrays extending perpendicular to the off-cut direction correspond to the threading edge dislocations nucleated during epitaxial growth...|$|R
