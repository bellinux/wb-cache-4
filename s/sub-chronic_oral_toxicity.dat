This study assesses acute and sub-chronic toxicity profile of hydro-methanolic extract of CS seeds using OECD guidelines. In acute toxicity study, mice were once orally administered 1000, 3000 and 5000 mg/kg body weight of CS extract. There were no any behavioral alterations or mortality recorded in CS treated groups. The LD 50 value was more than 5000 mg/kg body weight. In the <b>sub-chronic</b> <b>oral</b> <b>toxicity</b> study, the animals were orally administered with CS extract (1000, 2000 and 3000 mg/kg body weight) daily for 28 days whereas; vehicle control group received 0. 5 % carboxy methyl cellulose. There was significant reduction in food intake, body weight gain and plasma lipid profiles of CS 2 and CS 3 (2000 and 3000 mg/kg body weight respectively) groups {{as compared to the}} control group. However, there were no alterations in haematological profile, relative organ weights, histology and plasma markers of damage of vital organs (heart, liver and kidney). The overall finding of this study indicates that CS extract is non-toxic up to 3000 mg/kg body weight and can be considered as safe for consumption...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at {{determining}} the acute and <b>Sub-chronic</b> <b>oral</b> <b>toxicity</b> of Melissa officinalis essential oil and to serve as criteria to recommend the ethno pharmacological uses of the plant. In the acute toxicity test, oral administration of 300 and 2000 mg/kg of the Melissa officinalis essential oil was evaluated in mice. Sub-chronic toxicity was studied by daily oral dose of 100 and 200 mg/kg for three month. On day 0, 30, 60 and 90, blood samples collected from retro-orbital sinus of the eye rats were used for evaluation of serum biochemistry, hematology and histopathological examination of the heart, lungs, liver, kidney and spleen. The acute toxicity oral study revealed no observable signs of toxicity. In rats, the examination of signs, animal behavior and the changes in body and organs weights showed no abnormalities in the test groups {{as compared to the}} controls. There were no significant variations in the hematological parameters of both Melissa officinalis essential oil treated and untreated rats. However, biochemical parameters showed significant decrease in blood sugar. Melissa officinalis essential oil significantly (p< 0. 05) increased serum urea suggesting degenerative changes in the kidney. We can conclude that, Melissa officinalis essential oil is well tolerated in short term therapies but may have long term toxic effects on the kidney...|$|E
40|$|The {{acute and}} <b>sub-chronic</b> <b>oral</b> <b>toxicity</b> studies of hydro-methanolic {{extracts}} of Grewia crenata leaves were evaluated in rats. The extract {{at a single}} dose of 5000 mg/kg did not produce treatment related signs of toxicity or mortality {{in any of the}} animals tested during 14 days observation period. Therefore, LD 50 of this plant was estimated to be more than 5000 mg/kg. Phytochemical screening of the leaves extract revealed the plant to contain saponins, steroids, flavonoids, anthraquinones and glycosides. In the repeated dose 28 days oral toxicity study, administration of 900, 1800, 2700 and 3600 mg/kg of body weight G. crenata leaves extracts revealed no significantly difference (p< 0. 05) in the hematological parameter except for reduced platelet and increased differential blood count shown in some of the treated groups. Analysis of serum liver enzymes, uric acid, total protein, albumin, cholesterol, electrolytes and creatinine revealed no significant (P< 0. 05) changes in the extract treated groups compared to control group. However, significant differences (P< 0. 05) were seen in glucose, urea and bilirubin of the treated groups when compared to the control group. These results suggest that the sub-chronic administration of hydro-methanolic leaves extracts of Grewia crenata has no marked acute and sub-chronic toxic effect in rats...|$|E

Materials and methods In this sub-chronic toxicity study, rats were orally administered with the aqueous extract of H. erinaceus (HEAE) at doses of 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg body weight (b. w.) for 90 days. Body weights were recorded on a weekly basis and general behavioural changes were observed. The blood samples were subjected to haematological, biochemical, serum electrolyte, and antioxidant enzyme estimations. The rats were sacrificed and organs were processed and examined for histopathological changes. Results No mortality or morbidity was observed in all the treated and control rats. The results showed that the oral administration of HEAE daily at three different doses for 90 days had no adverse effect on the general behaviour, body weight, haematology, clinical biochemistry, and relative organ weights.

This diet was fed in 3 other treatments {{with the addition of}} phytase (500, 1000, or 2000 U/kg). Feed intake, body weight, tibia ash (%) and strength (N) and P and Ca utilization (% of intake) and excretion (g/kg DM) were measured. Enzyme safety was determined by genotoxicity and <b>sub-chronic</b> <b>oral</b> <b>toxicity</b> studies. Lower feed intake and higher weight gain was obtained with the treatment containing 2000 U/kg phytase compared to the two control treatments and the treatment containing 500 U/kg phytase, leading to a significant improvement in FCR with the 2000 U/kg phytase. Tibia strength and ash were improved with the latter and were dose-dependent described by an exponential function. Safety test using a concentrated preparation of the novel 6 -phytase enzyme did not reveal any toxicological significant findings. The enzyme did not induce mutagenic activity in the Ames test and did not increase the frequency of micronucleated binucleated cells in the micronucleus assay. In conclusion, this novel microbial 6 -phytase improved broiler performance and reduces the need for phosphate fortification of feed.

Though NK has been widely used for several decades, no scientific report was available on its safety. Present study was undertaken to demonstrate the <b>oral</b> <b>toxicity</b> of NK in Sprague Dawley rats. Methods Acute and 28 -day repeated <b>oral</b> <b>toxicity</b> studies were performed following OECD test guidelines 423 and 407, respectively, with minor modifications. In acute <b>oral</b> <b>toxicity</b> study, NK was administered at 2000 mg/kg b. wt., p. o and animals were observed for toxic signs at 0, 0. 5, 1, 4, 24 h and for next 14 days.

Two satellite groups (control and high dose) were also maintained to determine the delayed onset toxicity of NK. Animals were observed for mortality, morbidity, body weight changes, feed and water intake. Haematology, clinical biochemistry, electrolytes, gross pathology, relative organ weight and histopathological examination were performed. Results In acute toxicity study, no treatment related death or toxic signs were observed with NK administration. In the repeated dose study, no significant differences in body weight changes, food / water intake, haematology, clinical biochemistry and electrolytes content were observed between control and NK groups. No gross pathological findings and difference in relative organ weights were observed between control and NK treated rats. Histopathological examination revealed no abnormalities with NK treatment. Conclusion Acute study reveals that the LD 50 of NK is greater than 2000 mg/kg, b. wt. in fasted female rats and can be classified as Category 5. 28 -day repeated <b>oral</b> <b>toxicity</b> demonstrates that the No Observed Adverse Effect Level of NK is greater than 900 mg/kg b. wt. /day, p. o in rats.

No mortalities or evidence of adverse effects have been observed in Swiss albino mice following acute oral administration of ethanolic extract of M. pruriens at the dose of 2000 mg/ kg. This is the first report on the acute <b>oral</b> <b>toxicity</b> of M. pruriens and thus {{the findings of this study}} provide scientific validation on the use of the M. pruriens as a medicine for treating various ailments...|$|R
40|$|Mucuna Pruriens Linn. is an annual, {{climbing}} shrub {{which has}} an important place among aphrodisiac herbs in India since the ancient times. The plant has been using traditionally for many medicinal purposes such as Infertility, Parkinson’s disease, Loss of libido, Antioxidant, Anti venom, Anti microbial etc. The present study was carried out to investigate the preliminary phytochemical analysis and acute <b>oral</b> <b>toxicity</b> of the seeds of M. pruriens on albino mice. Matured seeds of M. pruriens were dried in shed and grinded in a mechanical grinder. The preliminary phytochemical analysis was done by following standard protocols. For acute <b>oral</b> <b>toxicity</b> study, methanolic extract of the seeds were used. The extract was prepared in a Soxlet apparatus. The preliminary phytochemical analysis showed the presence of protein, carbohydrates, glycosides, alkaloids, steroids, flavonoids, phenols and tannins. The acute <b>oral</b> <b>toxicity</b> study showed no mortality up to a dose of 4000 mg per kg body weight. The presence of plant chemicals revealed the medicinal values and the non toxic property of the plant indicated {{the value of the}} plant as medicine. Thus, we can conclude that, the seed of the plant {{can be used as a}} safe drug against many diseases...|$|R
40|$|In vitro {{cytotoxicity}} assays {{can be used}} as alternative toxicity {{tests to}} reduce the total number of animals needed for acute <b>oral</b> <b>toxicity</b> tests. This unit describes two methods for determining the in vitro cytotoxicity of test substances using neutral red uptake (NRU) and using the in vitro data to determine starting doses for in vivo acute <b>oral</b> systemic <b>toxicity</b> tests, e. g., the up-and-down procedure or the acute toxic class method. The use of the NRU methods to determine starting doses for acute <b>oral</b> <b>toxicity</b> tests may reduce the number of animals required, and for relatively toxic substances, this approach may also reduce the number of animals that die or require humane euthanasia due to severe toxicity. An interlaboratory validation study has demonstrated that the methods are useful and reproducible for these purposes. Two standardized protocols provide details for performing NRU tests with rodent and human cells. JRC. I. 2 -Chemical assessment and testin...|$|R
