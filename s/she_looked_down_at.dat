60|$|<b>She</b> sighed, and <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the {{handkerchief}} {{with which she}} had been toying.|$|R
60|$|Felicity said nothing. <b>She</b> kept <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{the grass}} {{on which she}} sat, absently pulling at the slender blades. Presently we saw two big tears roll down over her cheeks. The Story Girl looked surprised.|$|R
