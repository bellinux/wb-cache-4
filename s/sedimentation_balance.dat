Powders measured were Kanto loam, fused alumina, glass beads, ground feldspar and ground quartz. As a result, {{it was found that}} the average sizes obtained by the methods measuring a number of particles (optical microscopy, Coulter counter and light scattering) were greater than those by the methods based on settling particles in the liquid phase (Andreasen pipette, <b>sedimentation</b> <b>balance</b> and photo extinction).

40|$|This article {{presents}} a simple physical concept of aeolian dust accumulation, {{based on the}} behaviour of the subprocesses of dust deposition and dust erosion. The concept is tested in an aeolian dust wind tunnel. The agreement between the accumulation curve predicted by the model and the accumulation curve obtained in the experiments is close to perfect and shows {{that it is necessary}} to discriminate between the processes of aeolian dust deposition and aeolian dust accumulation. Two important thresholds determine the accumulation process. For wind speeds below the deflation threshold, the aeolian accumulation of dust increases linearly with the wind speed. For wind velocities between the deflation threshold and the accumulation limit, the <b>sedimentation</b> <b>balance</b> is above unity and there is still accumulation, though it rapidly drops once the deflation threshold has been exceeded. At wind speeds beyond the accumulation limit, the <b>sedimentation</b> <b>balance</b> is below unity and there will no longer be an accumulation of dust. The thresholds have been determined in a wind tunnel test at friction velocity u(*) = 0. 34 m s(- 1) (deflation threshold) and u(*) = 0. 43 in s(- 1) (accumulation limit), but these values are only indicative since they depend heavily on the characteristics of the accumulation surface and of the airborne grains.

The distribution of settling velocities then is calculated from an equation, which is known as Oden's formula. In this note the influence of random errors in the measured weight on the precision of the calculated distribution of settling velocities is analyzed. It is shown that the number of digitally sampled data values needed to calculate the distribution function increases with the ratio of time to sampling time interval, and that a compromise has be sought between precision and resolution.

40|$|In the {{mangrove}} of the Caeté Estuary (North Brazil) {{a detailed}} sampling {{was carried out}} in order to gain insight into the dynamics of inorganic nutrients and organic matter in one of the world's largest mangroves and to identify the driving forces behind these processes. Throughout 36 tidal cycles in the course of one year, concentrations of dissolved and particulate organic carbon and nitrogen (DOC, POC, DON, PON) and dissolved inorganic nutrients (N, P, Si compounds) were determined in a mangrove tidal creek. Annual average concentrations (in uM) were DOC 360, POC 240, DON 20, PON 29, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) 11, silicate 170 and phosphate 2. 4. Ammonium and nitrite were about 80 and 3 % of DIN, respectively. Nutrient dynamics in the creek were significantly influenced by porewater input from the upper forest sediment layer. This led to characteristic tidal signatures of nutrient and organic matter concentrations with maximum values during low tide. Annual phosphate and DOC oscillations were caused mainly by tidally dependent variations of porewater input. Their concentrations in the creek were directly proportional to the hydraulic gradient between creek and sediment water table. Due to autotrophic activity, dissolved oxygen, pH and DOC were higher and DIN was lower during daytime than at night. Annual oscillations of DIN and DON could also be attributed to varying phytoplanktonic activity. Silicate and phosphate showed only weak response to aquatic photosynthesis with slightly lower concentrations during the day. Assuming equilibrated fluxes, nitrogen fixation in the forest could be estimated to be 2. 3 mmol N/m 2 /d. Based on these findings, tidal range and porewater concentrations were identified as driving forces behind coastal outwelling of nutrients and organic matter from mangroves. Outwelling probably occurs only from mangroves where the nutrient concentration in porewater exceeds the demands of the benthic community and trees, caused by positive <b>sedimentation</b> <b>balances</b> and high nitrogen fixation rates, and only in macrotidal regions where porewater can flow in considerable amounts to the tidal creeks and the ocean...|$|R

In northern Bolivia, the orogenic wedge {{of the eastern}} Andes is very large, and its forward propagation controls the morphology of the Madeira drainage basin. We consider here the erosion and <b>sedimentation</b> mass <b>balance</b> {{in this part of}} the Amazon Basin, estimated on the basis of recent sediment yield data, within the current tectonic and geomorphic framework. The total suspended sediment (TSS) flux exported from the present orogenic wedge of northern Bolivia has been estimated at 500 - 600 million t year(- 1). More than 50 % of the total sediment load crossing the Madeira foreland basin system is deposited. The rest of the sediments (less than 46 %) reaches the eastern Amazon Basin, bypassing the Brazilian craton to the north. The average mass of sediment that has been deposited from the late Miocene to the present in the Madeira foreland basin sedimentation system is less than that intercepted today, by a factor of about 2. 4. These results can be interpreted as an increase in Bolivian foreland basin flexural Subsidence over time, associated with crust thickening and orogenic loading, and accentuated by the growing mass of retained sediments. They are consistent with the uplift rates of the Cordillera Oriental, obtained from fission-track dating, which began increasing significantly around 10 - 15 Ma...|$|R

By October 2013, the amount of sediment in Zhenshui reached 0. 2365 billion m 3, and the sand bar was 5. 78 m in height. Influenced by operational mode of reservoir and terrain, the formation of sand bar at Zhenshui estuary has certain inevitabilities. The sand bar can prevent water and sediment exchange between mainstream and tributary, and the internal storage capacity of tributary is not effectively used. Analyzing sand bar and its cause can supply some technical supports for prevention.

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 The Gorda Basin {{is a young}} oceanic plate {{which comes}} {{in direct contact with}} the {{convergent}} margin of western North America. Two long sonobuoy refraction profiles crossing the basin provide nearly continuous data for computing the velocity structure of the crust and adjacent continental slope. Time-term analysis utilizing multiple receivers and overlapping profiles revealed a thick transition layer which averages 2. 3 km but displays considerable lateral variation. The seismic compressional velocity of this layer is 5. 3 km/sec. Th average thickness of Layer 3 is 3. 4 km with a velocity of 6. 9 km/sec. The base of the crust is marked by the seismic Moho, the velocity below which is 8. 1 km/sec. Refraction and reflection studies of sediment cover indicate a thickening of turbidite deposits to the southeast from less than 100 meters to over 2. 5 km along the continental margin. Ophiolite studies indicate that the top of Layer 3 marks the upper extent of amphibolite facies metamorphism of basaltic sheeted dikes. Lateral depth variations of this seismic boundary in the Gorda Basin may suggest the occurrence of isograd relief along the spreading center. The Moho marks the boundary between mafic and ultramafic rocks near the ridge but may represent the maximum depth of serpentinization in the crust after it moves away from the spreading axis. Thin crust (4 - 5 km) and deep bathymetry in the central portion of the basin have resulted from crustal formation processes occurring at ridge crest offsets and are coincident with recent seismicity in the area. The Gorda ridge offsets and asymmetrical fan spreading of magnetic anomalies are features observed in response to a regional change in spreading directions and encroachment of the Pacific and North American plates. The Gorda plate as a whole does not respond rigidly to the resulting north-south compression. Complex structures of the continental slope, revealed by seismic reflection, limited the reduction of refraction data using plane layer methods. A simplified seismic section was computed consisting of three probable sediment layers with velocities of 1. 8, 2. 5 and 4. 0 km/sec overlying oceanic crust. The crust is observed to dip about two degrees towards the continent {{at the base of the}} slope. A model of subduction unique to the northern California margin is one whereby young crust is subducted slowly and quickly reheated so that no brittle portion remains at normal Benioff depths.

The earliest recovery of three grades by sedimentation ccurred in 1784. The term "mechanical nalysis " was introduced in 1800. Sieving and decantation were combined into a single technique in 180, 5.

At the optimum dosage, the settling rate of the floc formed by MeSP was 6 - 7 mm/s, while those formed by chitosan and PAC were about 2 mm/s. MeSP showed the highest flocculation performance at pH 3 - 7 among these flocculants. At pH 8 - 12, the flocculation performance of MeSP was much higher than that of PAC, but lower than that of chitosan.

40|$|The {{particle}} size distribution and mean {{particle size}} {{are the most important}} characteristics in particulate or powder technology. Various approaches have been used to measure {{particle size distribution}}s. For solid-liquid systems, the particle size distributions have been measured by the Stokes diameter. The Andreasen pipette method, <b>sedimentation</b> <b>balance</b> method, centrifugal sedimentation method, etc. have been used to measure the particle size distribution in suspensions. These methods measure the migration velocities of particles in solution, and then particle size is calculated using Stokes formula. However, all these methods are time consuming and require special skills. On the other hand, a different principle can be used to analyze the particle size distribution through microscopy, laser diffraction/scattering method, and a Coulter counter method. These methods require numerous samples to accurately determine the particle size distribution. Although the laser diffraction/scattering and Coulter counter methods produce highly accurate results within a shorter time, they require extremely expensive equipment. Hence, a simple and cost effective method to determine the particle size distribution is highly demanded. The investigation of particle size distributions by the buoyancy weighing-bar method which is a novel method in particle size distribution measurement have been done for several samples particles of Japan Industrial Standard (Test Powders 1 and Test Powders 2), Sumitomo 3 M (glass beads K 1, K 37, S 60 HS), polystyrene beads (spherical), nylon beads (cylindrical), etc. The influence of solid concentration, influence of shape and size of weighing bar and influence of vessel size also had been investigated in particle size distribution measurement by the buoyancy weighing-bar method. The result data obtained by the buoyancy weighing-bar method were comparable with the others particle size analyzer, such as <b>sedimentation</b> <b>balance</b> method, Andreasen pipette method, Coulter counter method, microscopy and the laser diffraction/scattering method. The buoyancy weighing-bar method is suitable for measuring the settling particle size distribution and the floating particle size distribution. The buoyancy weighing-bar method could be used to measure the particle size distribution in Stokes region and in Allen region. The particle size distribution obtained by the buoyancy weighing-bar method could be used to estimate the smaller particle size by using the Rosin-Rammler distribution. Theory was rediscussed and the new mean particle size was defined. Beside, the buoyancy weighing-bar method could be used to determine the mean particle sizes for a ternary mixture and multi-component particles in a short time. This ability is very useful in the powder industry. Similar to other methods to analyze particle size, the buoyancy weighing-bar method is accurate in an initially homogeneous suspension. Because the buoyancy weighing-bar method apparatus can be made by hand, it is also economical. Additionally, the buoyancy weighing-bar method is easier to be implemented compared to other sedimentation particle analysis methods. 室蘭工業大学 (Muroran Institute of Technology) 博士（工学...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The {{objectives}} of the field study were to evaluate the measurement of rumen-pH and titration of rumen fluid and to assess the diagnostic value of sedimentation and flotation time and methylene blue test compared to rumen-pH changes. Material and methods: The study comprised 293 rumen fluid samples from clinically healthy heifers (n= 24) and cows (n= 62) which were kept in 10 different dairy herds. Four consecutive samples from each animal were obtained at the following time periods: 1. dry cows/heifers, 30 days ante partum to calving; 2. cows immediately post partum (p. p.), 0 to 7 days p. p.; 3. cows in early lactation, 8 to 30 days p. p., and 4. cows in middle lactation, 80 to 150 days p. p. Results: There were {{no statistically significant differences}} between heifers and cows and also no differences between the herds. The highest rumen-pH was measured in animals during dry period. In contrast, cows immediately after calving and in early lactation had the lowest rumen-pH-values. Compared to physiological pH-range (5. 8 – 7. 2) 20 animals had rumen-pH-values &# 60; 5. 8 (among those six animals &# 60; 5. 5) and 21 animals &# 62; 7. 2. The mean titration balance in animals during dry period was neutral and the rumen fluid showed a significant base deficit during lactation. The buffer capacity was lowest in cows immediately after calving and in early lactation. A very high correlation coefficient (r= 0. 98, p&# 60; 0. 001) was found between rumen-pH and titration <b>balance.</b> <b>Sedimentation</b> and flotation time and methylene blue test did not differ during the study period. Conclusion and clinical relevance: Since the rumen-pH measurements precisely reflect the acid-base-status of the rumen fluid the more laborious titration method might not be required in routine diagnostic. However, titration has the potential advantage to measure buffer capacity of rumen fluid and therefore to estimate the stability of rumen pH.

According to the estimation of 4. 9 millon ha in Pampa Ondulada Region, 1. 600. 000 ha (36 % of agricultural soils) are affected by the erosion. Field measurements of soil erosion and sediment deposition using classical techniques are difficult, time consuming, and expensive but indispensable to feed the prediction models for conservation practices design and fa rm planning. Many authors have reported that the measurement of fallout nuclides is useful tool to characterize geomorphical processes. Walling and He proposes models for conve rting 137 Cs depletion/enrichment amounts to net soil loss/deposition. These models are based in the comparison between a reference 137 Cs profile in a long term undisturbed site (control site) and the 137 Cs profiles in the suspected eroded or deposited sites in the landscape. The aim {{of this study is to}} provide a complete and well representative set of data on the erosion intensity in topographical conditions for the Pampa Ondulada Region in A rgentine by using a tracer technique. The study area is a small watershed (about 300 ha), located in Arroyo del Tala medium basin, within Partido of San Pedro in Buenos Aires Province, Argentine. This paper presents a group of results from a detailed investigation of erosion and sediment delivery, within a 49 ha cultivated field study site in this watershed. The base of sampling strategy is the grid approach. A reference inventory, representing the local fallout input, was searched for at a site experiencing neither erosion nor deposition. Radiocaesium analyses were made at the Nuclear Regulatory Authority Laboratory by a GE Hp detector. To make an interpretation of 137 Cs distribution of soil losses and <b>sedimentation,</b> the Mass <b>Balance</b> Model 2 was used (Walling and He 1997). The erosion/deposition rates from Mass Balance Model 2 are in the range of 0 to - 30 t·ha- 1 ·y- 1 for erosion, and 0 to 19 t·ha- 1 ·y- 1 for deposition, and these values matched well, with the rates of erosion obtained by classical methods.

40|$|On a {{timescale}} {{of years}} to decades, vegetated foredunes may show various modes of morphological development. Vegetation {{is one of the}} factors that determine the sedimentation pattern and thus morphology on the foredune. In turn, the vegetation pattern may be controlled by the sedimentation pattern. Although these effects have been quantified for short timescales, there is relatively little information on the interaction between vegetation and sedimentation for timescales of over a year. For the island of Ameland, the Netherlands, elevation measurements and aerial photographs between 2002 and 2012 were used to derive changes in elevation and vegetation patterns on a year-to-year basis. This was done for a range of stable to accreting foredunes. Sedimentation increases from the beach to a maximum halfway up the seaward slope of the foredune, and then decreases again when going landward. This trend is further modified by the vegetation's spatial pattern. On a timescale of years, there is no correlation between the density of vegetation cover and the amount of accretion. However, by accounting for the gradual depletion of the sand load over the foredune, a relationship can be defined between vegetation cover and its trapping efficiency. Foredune vegetation spreads mainly by lateral expansion of existing patches. No strong effect was found of the <b>sedimentation</b> <b>balance</b> on the expansion of vegetation. It is suggested that other growth-limiting factors are of similar importance, masking any possible dependency of vegetation growth on sand accretion...|$|E

Three rather different sets of samples were studied to evaluate the application of this methodology to questions of the origin and dispersion of quartz in deep-sea sediments. Textural analysis of chemically purified quartz reveals the following general features: 1. All the samples are polymodal in the 2 to 64 micron size range. 2. The modal character of quartz in river sediment persists in the marine environment and can serve as a provenance indicator. 3. Dispersal processes that act on a fine-grained sediment may change the relative proportions of the constituent quartz modes, but do not significantly alter the position of these modes. The way in which the relative proportion of the assorted modes vary within a depositional area may serve as a tool for mapping energy fields at the sea floor...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, two {{important}} thermo-physical properties of nanofluids: thermal conductivity and viscosity together with shelf stability {{of them are}} investigated. Nanofluids are defined as colloidal suspension of solid particles {{with the size of}} lower than 100 nanometer. Thermal conductivity, viscosity and stability of nanofluids were measured by means of TPS method, rotational method and <b>sedimentation</b> <b>balance</b> method, respectively. TPS analyzer and viscometer were calibrated in the early stage and all measured data were in the reasonable range. Effect of some parameters including temperature, concentration, size, shape, alcohol addition and sonication time has been studied on thermal conductivity and viscosity of nanofluids. It has been concluded that increasing temperature, concentration and sonication time can lead to thermal conductivity enhancement while increasing amount of alcohol can decrease thermal conductivity of nanofluids. Generally, tests relating viscosity of nanofluids revealed that increasing concentration increases viscosity; however, increasing other investigated parameters such as temperature, sonication time and amount of alcohol decrease viscosity. In both cases, increasing size of nanofluid results in thermal conductivity and viscosity reduction up to specific size (250 nm) while big particle size (800 nm) increases thermal conductivity and viscosity, drastically. In addition, silver nanofluid with fiber shaped nanoparticles showed higher thermal conductivity and viscosity compared to one with spherical shape nanoparticles. Furthermore, effect of concentration and sonication time have been inspected on stability of nanofluids. Test results indicated that increasing concentration speeds up sedimentation of nanoparticles while bath sonication of nanofluid brings about lower weight for settled particles. Considering relative thermal conductivity to relative viscosity of some nanofluids exposes that ascending or descending behavior of graph can result in some preliminary evaluation regarding applicability of nanofluids as coolant. It can be stated that ascending trend shows better applicability of the sample in higher temperatures while it is opposite for descending trend. Meanwhile, it can be declared that higher value for this factor shows more applicable nanofluid with higher thermal conductivity and less viscosity. Finally, {{it has been shown that}} sedimentation causes reduction of thermal conductivity as well as viscosity. For further research activities, it would be suggested to focus more on microscopic investigation regarding behavior of nanofluids besides macroscopic study...|$|E

The coasts of the Ligurian Sea {{are among the most}} urbanised and industrialised along the Italian coastline: the main causes of disturbance being littoral urban development and harbour activities, the building of littoral rail- and highways, and the presence of several polluted discharges. This review, by evaluating the huge scientific output published in the last three decades, describes and discusses the most important geological, hydrological and biological characteristics of the Ligurian Sea. We show that this regional sea has largely been investigated in terms of its geological and structural evolution, as well as in terms of the sedimentation dynamics of the littoral and deep bottoms, with particular attention to the <b>sedimentation</b> <b>balance</b> of the beaches and their erosive processes. We report that the prevalent hydrodynamic and meteo-oceanographic conditions favour a continuous exchange of coastal water masses, and that the seasonal and interannual dynamics of water masses can effects the local climate, with direct and indirect consequences on fish and benthic communities documented in the last decade. We stress that although recent studies offer good knowledge of the distribution of coastal benthic communities, only scant information is available for the whole continental shelf, the submarine canyons and the rocky bathyal bottoms. Our meta-analysis reveals that significant fishing activities are monitored, but also that certain sectors of the biological resource are suffering, and suggests the set up of appropriate management measures. The Ligurian Sea hosts a number of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) of high relevance, while the institution of the Whale Sanctuary completes the protection policy of the Regione Liguria. Our meta-analysis points out the need for long-term studies, based primarily on the analysis of those areas of the Ligurian Sea that have been little investigated to date.
