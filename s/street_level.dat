5|$|After delays due to {{concerns}} over nearby wetlands {{and the appearance}} of the ramps from <b>street</b> <b>level,</b> the Town of Winchester granted approval in March 2011. In April 2011, the MBTA began soliciting bids for the primary construction work on the station, worth $1.525 million. The scope of work included construction of the mini-high platforms and ramps from <b>street</b> <b>level,</b> as well as adding lighting, rehabilitating the low level platforms, and creating accessible parking spaces. After bids came in higher than expected, a $2.503 million contract was awarded in July 2011 with notice to proceed in August.|$|E

30|$|From an {{implementation}} perspective, providing {{small cell}} backhaul at <b>street</b> <b>levels</b> is more challenging and expensive than providing macrocell backhauling at rooftops. This {{is because it}} is difficult to reach <b>street</b> <b>levels</b> using inexpensive LOS links. Deploying backhauling at <b>street</b> <b>levels</b> also requires backhaul equipment which has to be compact and secure to avoid accidental damages and tampering as well as to ease the deployment.|$|R

Convention Place is the only bus-exclusive station in the tunnel, and consists of four sheltered platforms in a sunken, open-air layover space below <b>street</b> <b>level.</b> Buses enter the tunnel under 9th Avenue, passing under the historic Camlin Hotel, before joining the University Link Tunnel used by light rail trains headed north for three blocks under Pine Street to Capitol Hill station.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} design planned for most theater patrons {{to enter the}} theater from the underground parking garage, but the success of Millennium Park and neighboring businesses has caused most attendees to enter at <b>street</b> <b>level.</b> The design's limited elevator service has caused bottlenecks for <b>street</b> <b>level</b> patrons. Additional elevators and escalators, which would require special dedicated funding, have been considered. The initial construction leaked and did not protect some non-public spaces from water exposure; this cost Chicago taxpayers $1million for repairs in 2008.|$|E

5|$|The Public Safety Building, {{located at}} the station's {{northeast}} entrance, was demolished in 2005.

5|$|A new {{station was}} built in 1897, {{slightly}} to the southeast, behind the Lovell Block. In 1927, the Fitchburg Cutoff became freight-only between the Alewife area and Somerville Junction. Passenger trains from the Lexington Branch and the Central Massachusetts Railroad were diverted to the Fitchburg mainline and began to stop at Cambridge station. In 1937, the Boston and Maine Railroad built a two-story brick depot by the bridge, with the ticket office at <b>street</b> <b>level</b> and the waiting room and platforms below.|$|E
5|$|Between April and August 2016 the Bakerloo line {{platforms}} {{were closed}} to enable escalator replacements {{and the construction}} of connecting passageways to the new Crossrail platforms due to open in 2018. In December 2016 Westminster City Council approved proposals to construct a new mixed-use development called Paddington Quarter on a site adjacent to the mainline station. The plans include reconstruction of the Bakerloo line station to provide a larger ticket hall and better access between platforms and <b>street</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E
