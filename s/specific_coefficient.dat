But so far, it has been difficult to detect PM 2. 5 mass concentration profile. The proposed methodology to study the relationship between aerosol extinction coefficient and PM 2. 5 mass concentration is described, which indicates that the PM 2. 5 mass concentration profile could be retrieved by combining a charge-coupled device (CCD) side-scatter lidar with a PM 2. 5 sampling detector. When the relative humidity is less than 70  %, PM 2. 5, mass concentration is proportional to the aerosol extinction coefficient, and then the <b>specific</b> <b>coefficient</b> can be calculated. Through this <b>specific</b> <b>coefficient,</b> aerosol extinction profile is converted to PM 2. 5 mass concentration profile.

The characteristics of PM 2. 5 mass concentration profile at the near-ground level during the cases of these 3 nights in the western suburb of Hefei city were discussed. The PM 2. 5 air pollutant concentration is comparatively large close to the surface and varies with time and altitude.

40|$|The {{exploration}} of alternative solvents for supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) {{technology has been}} attributed to the high capital investment due to higher pressure required by using supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO 2) as a solvent. One of the potential alternative solvent is the sub-critical R 134 a, which can be operated at lower pressure than SC-CO 2. This research investigate the use of dense gas approach, density based approach and solubility parameter to predict the solubility model of palm oil extraction from palm fruit using sub-critical R 134 a in SFE systems. Firstly, the dense gas approach involves the estimation of pure component vapour pressures, critical properties and binary interaction was implemented. This is followed by the development of thermodynamic model by using the equation of states (EOS) which are Peng-Robinson (PR) and Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) combined with four mixing rules that includes excess Gibbs energy model. The density-based as the second approach requires the information of density, pressure and temperature. The performance of seven density based models were analysed in this research. Lastly, the solvent and solute solubility parameters were calculated using regular solution theory. Solvent <b>specific</b> <b>coefficient</b> for R 134 a was then determined using experimental data published. The proposed solvent <b>specific</b> <b>coefficient</b> for R 134 a is 11. 8138 and this coefficient can be used for universal calculation of solubility which involves R 134 a as a solvent. Based on comparison of all correlation method, dense gas approach using the combination of PR EOS and Solute-Solute Interaction (SSI) mixing rule shows the lowest Average Absolute Relative Deviation (AARD), 0. 08 % compared to other methods. Due to complex calculation involved, T-P model regressed by Design Expert software is suggested as the best method to model the solubility behaviour of palm oil extraction from palm fruit using sub-critical R 134 a in the SFE systems...|$|E

40|$|The {{value of}} travel time savings (VTTS) {{is often the}} largest benefit from {{transportation}} projects. As a result, the value of time (VOT) has been studied extensively. Recently, additional {{attention has been paid}} to the fact that travelers also benefit from reliable travel times. Thus, the value of reliability (VOR) is beginning to factor into cost/benefit analyses of transportation projects and understanding travelers? mode and route choices. VOR has almost always been estimated through stated preference data or survey based revealed preference data. In this research, empirical data was used in an attempt to estimate VOR. The first concern regarding estimating VOR from empirical data is the lack of a definitive measurement for reliability. In this research, data from Katy Freeway, where travelers choose between tolled but reliable lanes and free but less reliable lanes, was used in an attempt to find the best measurement of reliability that could lead to the best explanation of travelers? lane choice. Multinomial logit models and mixed logit models were used to estimate travelers? lane choice based on trip attributes including travel time, travel time reliability and toll. Although models including only travel time and toll yielded reasonable results and VOTs ($ 2. 78 /hr, $ 9. 09 /hr, and $ 10. 52 /hr for off-peak, shoulder, and peak-period travelers, respectively), adding alternative <b>specific</b> <b>coefficient</b> (ASC) or reliability measures to the models caused counter-intuitive results. Although various reliability measures were used in the models, it was not possible to conclude which measure is the best as all models had counter-intuitive results. Models also had a relatively large alternative <b>specific</b> <b>coefficient</b> which indicates a weak relationship between lane choice and other trip attributes. Therefore, the results from this research suggest that more research on how travelers perceive benefits of managed lanes (MLs) and choose between managed lanes and general purpose lanes (GPLs) is needed (particularly how, and if, they value reliability) ...|$|E
