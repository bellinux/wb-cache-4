5|$|At the marabout's zawiya, Eberhardt was {{weakened}} by fever. She returned to Aïn Sefra, and was treated {{at the military}} hospital. She left the hospital against medical advice and asked Ehnni, from whom she had been separated for several months, to join her. Reunited on 20October 1904, they rented a small mud house. The following day, a flash flood struck the area. As soon as the waters subsided, Lyautey launched a search for her. Ehnni was discovered almost immediately, saying that Eberhardt had been swept away by the water. Based on this information, Lyautey and his men searched the surrounding area for several days before deciding to explore {{the ruins of the}} house the couple had stayed in. Her body was crushed under one of the house's <b>supporting</b> <b>beams.</b> The exact circumstances of her death were never discovered. While some biographers have raised suspicions regarding Ehnni, most believe it more likely that Eberhardt, who had always believed she would die young, instead accepted her fate. Mackworth speculated that after initially trying to run from the floodwaters, Eberhardt instead turned back to face them. Blanch argued that due to Eberhardt's history of suicidal tendencies, she probably would have still chosen to stay in the area even if she had known the flood was coming. Lyautey buried Eberhardt in Aïn Sefra and had a marble tombstone, engraved with her adopted name in Arabic and her birth name in French, placed on her grave.|$|E

After long-term research in design and application, the system of simply <b>supported</b> <b>beam</b> bridges (20, 24 and 32  m in span) for Chinese passenger dedicated line was formed [3, 4]. According to statistical data, the total kilometrage of simply <b>supported</b> <b>beam</b> bridges is {{more than half of the}} total length of high-speed railways in China, and the most widely used is the 32  m simply <b>supported</b> <b>beam.</b> Thus, ensuring the service performance of continuous welded rail (CWR) on the simply <b>supported</b> <b>beam</b> bridge is essential for safe operation of railways.|$|R
40|$|A novel, {{suspended}} {{thin film}} bulk acoustic wave resonator (SFBAR) has been fabricated from an aluminum nitride film sputtered directly on a (100) silicon Substrate. The suspended membrane design uses thin <b>beams</b> to <b>support,</b> {{as well as}} electrically connect, the resonator and has been fabricated using both thin film processing and bulk silicon micromachining. The quality factor and the effective electromechanical coupling coefficient were characterized {{as a function of}} the number and the length of the <b>support</b> <b>beams.</b> The length of the <b>support</b> <b>beams</b> was found to affect neither the quality factor at resonance nor the effective electromechanical coupling factor. However, longer <b>support</b> <b>beams</b> did facilitate better frequency pair response.

500|$|The {{original}} {{exterior of}} Manjakamiadana comprised over 70,000granite stones, of which approximately 20,000 had become cracked during {{the fire and}} needed replacement. The western wall of the palace partially collapsed in January 2004 and required complete rebuilding. [...] Every stone was removed and numbered to facilitate the reinsertion of each one in its original place with two French stone-masonry companies engaged to supervise the work. The foundation was modernised, first using laser technology to assess the topography of the site, then by driving 22cement piles into the ground beneath the foundation base {{to a depth of}} [...] Phase2 consisted of replacing each of the numbered exterior wall stones in its original place, bolstered where needed by new stones to replace those damaged in the fire. Although the palace interior was originally made of wood, the reconstructed building was designed using reinforced concrete interior <b>supporting</b> <b>beams</b> for the walls, ceiling and roof due to concerns over the availability and durability of hardwood. Finally, the roof was re-tiled in blue-gray slate imported from quarries near the French city of Angers.|$|E
500|$|In {{some ways}} the armour {{protection}} given to the Indefatigables was weaker than that of their predecessors as the armour was reduced in thickness {{in a number of}} places, but it was spread out to a greater extent. The main belt ran from stem to stern; it was [...] thick for the middle [...] of the ship, but was reduced to [...] abreast the end 12-inch gun barbettes and magazines and thinned still further to [...] at the ends of the ship. A [...] bulkhead met the barbette of X turret while the forward bulkhead was [...] in thickness. The gun turrets and barbettes were protected by [...] of armour, except for the turret roofs which used [...] of Krupp non-cemented armour (KNC). The <b>supporting</b> <b>beams</b> for the turret roofs were reinforced over those of the Invincibles based on lessons learned in firing trials conducted during 1907. The thickness of the main deck was generally [...] of nickel steel, but increased to [...] {{around the base of the}} barbettes. The lower deck armour of nickel steel was [...] on the flat and 2inches thick on the slope, but increased to two inches at the ship's ends. The sides of the forward conning tower were [...] thick while the spotting tower had four inches. The roof and floor of both towers were KNC armour 3inches thick while the conning tower's communication tube was four inches of KNC. The torpedo director tower 1inch of nickel steel all around. Nickel steel torpedo bulkheads of 2.5-inch thickness were fitted abreast the magazines and shell rooms. The funnel uptakes were protected with 1.5inches of nickel steel on the sides and 1inch on the ends. Krupp cemented armour was used throughout, unless otherwise mentioned.|$|E

To allow {{the opening of a}} room at the ground floor and therefore create some usable space, the pagoda's central shaft, which originally reached the ground, was shortened to the upper stories, where it rested on <b>supporting</b> <b>beams.</b> In that room are enshrined statues of the temple's main objects of worship.

40|$|Abstract—The {{nonlinear}} {{dynamics of}} micromechanical oscil-lators are explored experimentally. Devices consist of singly and doubly <b>supported</b> Si <b>beams,</b> 200 nm thick and 35 μm long. When illuminated within a laser interference field, devices self-oscillate {{in their first}} bending mode due to feedback between laser heating and device displacement. Compressive prestress buckles doubly <b>supported</b> <b>beams</b> leading to a strong amplitude–frequency relationship. Significant frequency instability is seen in doubly <b>supported</b> devices. Self-resonant <b>beams</b> are also driven inertially with varying drive amplitude and frequency. Regions of primary, sub-, and superharmonic entrainment are measured. Statistics of primary entrainment are measured for low drive amplitudes, where the effects of frequency instability are measurable. Sub-and superharmonic entrainment are not seen in singly <b>supported</b> <b>beams.</b> A simple model is built to explain why high-order entrainment is seen only in doubly <b>supported</b> <b>beams.</b> Its analysis suggests that the strong amplitude–frequency relationship in doubly <b>supported</b> <b>beams</b> enables hysteresis, wide regions of primary entrainment, and high orders of sub- and superharmonic entrainment.

2500|$|The {{architecture}} of ancient Greece is of a trabeated or [...] "post and lintel" [...] form, i.e. it {{is composed of}} upright beams (posts) supporting horizontal beams (lintels). Although the existent buildings of the era are constructed in stone, {{it is clear that}} the origin of the style lies in simple wooden structures, with vertical posts <b>supporting</b> <b>beams</b> which carried a ridged roof. The posts and beams divided the walls into regular compartments which could be left as openings, or filled with sun dried bricks, lathes or straw and covered with clay daub or plaster. Alternately, the spaces might be filled with rubble. It is likely that many early houses and temples were constructed with an open porch or [...] "pronaos" [...] above which rose a low pitched gable or pediment.|$|E
