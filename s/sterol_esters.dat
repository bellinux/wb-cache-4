They are added to certain oil-containing products like margarine, milk, or yogurt to make functional foods for controlling cholesterol levels. Studies have indicated that consumption of about 2 grams per day of phytosterol esters provides a reduction in LDL cholesterol of around 10%. <b>Sterol</b> <b>esters</b> are added to certain Unilever products under the brand name Becel/Flora.|$|E

The <b>sterol</b> and <b>sterol</b> <b>ester</b> contents of walls did not change during germination. The <b>sterol</b> <b>ester</b> content of membranes and cell sap remained constant during germination, whereas the sterol content increased during the outgrowth of germ tubes. On the basis of differential extraction studies {{it was concluded that}} the loss of. resistance to polyenes that occurred {{in the early stages of}} swelling of conidia during germination was not due to a movement of <b>sterol</b> or <b>sterol</b> <b>ester</b> out of the wall. Radioactive-labelling experiments demonstrated that, although the amounts of conidial wall <b>sterol</b> and <b>sterol</b> <b>ester</b> did not change during germination, they were metabolically active.

Lytic activity was found to be lost when samples were boiled for 5 min. An examination of the lipid composition of LF before and after boiling showed changes which may be useful in studies on the mechanism of activity of this factor.

50|$|Increasing fiber {{consumption}} {{has been}} shown to reduce levels of LDL cholesterol. Each gram of increase in soluble fiber reduces LDL by an average of 2.2 mg/dL (0.057 mmol/L). Increasing consumption of whole grains reduces LDL cholesterol, with whole grain oats being particularly effective. The inclusion of 2 g per day of plant stanol or <b>sterol</b> <b>esters</b> and 10 to 20 g per day of soluble fiber decrease dietary cholesterol absorption.

A serving of of the food supplies ___grams of plant stanol esters.Reviewing clinical trials involving phytosterol supplementation, the FDA concluded that when consumed in the range of 1 to 3 grams in enriched foods, phytosterols resulted in statistically significant (5-15%) reductions in blood LDL cholesterol levels relative to placebo. The FDA also concluded that a daily dietary intake of 2 grams a day of phytosterols (expressed as non-esterified phytosterols) is required to demonstrate a relationship between phytosterol consumption and cholesterol lowering for reduced CVD risk.|$|E
50|$|Lanolin (from Latin lāna, ‘wool’, and oleum, ‘oil’), {{also called}} wool wax or wool grease, is a wax {{secreted}} by the sebaceous glands of wool-bearing animals. Lanolin used by humans comes from domestic sheep breeds that are raised specifically for their wool. Historically, many pharmacopoeias {{have referred to}} lanolin as wool fat (adeps lanae); however, as lanolin lacks glycerides (glycerol esters), {{it is not a}} true fat. Lanolin primarily consists of <b>sterol</b> <b>esters</b> instead. Lanolin's waterproofing property aids sheep in shedding water from their coats. Certain breeds of sheep produce large amounts of lanolin. There is an inverse correlation between fiber diameter and wool wax content.|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} sterols {{were identified}} in barley shoots: stigmasterol, β-sitosterol, campesterol, and cholesterol. The total sterol content of green and etiolated tissue was 2. 84 and 3. 20 milligrams per gram dry weight, respectively. The free sterols accounted {{for most of the}} difference in total sterol content. The <b>sterol</b> <b>ester,</b> <b>sterol</b> glycoside, and acylated sterol glycoside contents of green and etiolated barley shoots were essentially the same. Etiolated tissue had twice as much total β-sitosterol as stigmasterol, while green tissue had equal amounts of these two sterols. The campesterol and cholesterol content was the same in green and etiolated tissue. This same sterol composition pattern held true for the free, glycosidic, and acylated glycosidic sterols; however, the <b>sterol</b> <b>ester</b> fraction had a completely different composition pattern. The esterified stigmasterol content was quite low in green and etiolated tissue, and campesterol was the second largest esterfied sterol component in etiolated tissue. Etiolated barley seedlings exposed to light had a shift in the ratio of free stigmasterol to β-sitosterol in favor of stigmasterol; however, no correlation was observed between chlorophyll synthesis and shift in sterol composition...|$|R

Co-immunoprecipitation and bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments demonstrated that these proteins dimerize, either by flexible pairing (ABCG 11 and ABCG 9) or by forming strict heterodimers (ABCG 14). In addition, metabolome analyses and measurement of <b>sterol</b> <b>ester</b> contents in the mutants suggested that ABCG 9, ABCG 11 and ABCG 14 are involved in lipid/sterol homeostasis regulation.

5000|$|The name Becel {{originates}} {{from the}} three letter acronym BCL (Blood Cholesterol Lowering). When introduced, the blood cholesterol lowering effect was achieved by modifying the triacylglycerol (TAG) profile of the fat used in the margarine: an increased level of poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) reduces the blood cholesterol level. More recently, products were introduced under the [...] "Pro-activ" [...] sub-brand. These products {{are based on the}} effects of plant sterols and <b>sterol</b> <b>esters</b> on blood cholesterol lowering. In recent years the Becel/Flora brand has added cooking oil, pot yogurt and yogurt drinks to the non-margarine products, all of which are designed to help lower blood cholesterol level. This is achieved by a highly increased resorption of beta-sitosterol and other phytosterols which accumulate especially in the intima of blood vessels and may cause arteriosclerotic plaques. In consequence, consumption of Becel products does not lower the risk for coronary diseases such as arteriosclerosis and therefore does not inherit any medical benefits.|$|E

Design: Randomised, controlled, single-blind study with <b>sterol</b> <b>esters</b> and non-esterified plant stanols provided in breakfast cereal, bread and spreads. Study 1 comprised 12 weeks during which <b>sterol</b> <b>esters</b> (2. 4 g) and stanol (2. 4 g) -containing foods were eaten during 4 week test periods of cross-over design following a 4 week control food period. In Study 2, in a random order cross-over design, a 50 % dairy fat spread with or without 2. 4 g <b>sterol</b> <b>esters</b> daily was tested. Subjects: Hypercholesterolaemic subjects; 22 in study 1 and 15 in study 2. Main outcome measures: Plasma lipids, plasma sterols, plasma carotenoids and tocopherols. Results: Study 1 &frac 34;median LDL cholesterol was reduced by the <b>sterol</b> <b>esters</b> (- 13. 6 %; P< 0. 001 by ANOVA on ranks; P< 0. 05 by pairwise comparison) and by stanols (- 8. 3 %; P= 0. 003, ANOVA and < 0. 05 pairwise comparison). With <b>sterol</b> <b>esters</b> plasma plant sterol levels rose (35 % for sitosterol, 51 % for campesterol; P< 0. 001); plasma lathosterol rose 20 % (P= 0. 03), indicating compensatory increased cholesterol synthesis. With stanols, plasma sitosterol fell 22 % (P= 0. 004), indicating less cholesterol absorption. None of the four carotenoids measured in plasma changed significantly. In study 2, median LDL cholesterol rose 6. 5 % with dairy spread and fell 12. 2 % with the sitosterol ester fortified spread (P= 0. 03 ANOVA and < 5 % pairwise comparison). Conclusion: 1. Plant <b>sterol</b> <b>esters</b> and non-esterified stanols, two-thirds of which were incorporated into low-fat foods, contributed effectively to LDL cholesterol lowering, extending the range of potential foods. 2.
