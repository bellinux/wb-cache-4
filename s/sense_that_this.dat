Some distinctions seem motivated by (or reflect) actual philosophical differences between Judaism and Samaritanism. Some of these are glaringly obvious, like {{the inclusion of a}} passage in the Samaritan version of the Ten Commandments that restates the command to build an altar on Mt. Gerizim, and says plainly that Mt. Gerizim is the site where all future sacrifices must be offered. Since the location of God's holy site is probably the central original difference between Judaism and Samaritanism, it makes <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> passage is in one version and not the other.|$|E

The result is an event comic that has two more issues to go yet still hasn’t decided exactly what this story is really about." [...] He however, enjoyed Lex Luthor's appearance in the issue. Conversely, Richard Gray of Newsarama gave the issue an 8 out of 10, saying [...] "For all the false starts and misdirection of the New 52, the first major crossover in “Trinity War” has come together nicely.

[...] Jim Johnson of Comic Book Resources gave the issue 4 stars out of 5, feeling it was [...] "loads of fanboy fun" [...] and the issue actually progressed the series storyline, not just the event's storyline.|$|E

Ashley Zimmerman from the New Times Broward-Palm Beach called the opening night of the tour [...] "memorable", {{describing}} the set by Thirty Seconds to Mars as [...] "a bit like a party", during which lead vocalist Jared Leto provided [...] "raw and beautiful vocals". She further wrote that co-headliner Linkin Park played a [...] "great mix {{of old and new}} songs" [...] that was able to please those who brought the band to fame, while still showcasing the newest work. Jay Cridlin of the Tampa Bay Times commented that the two bands made Steinbrenner Field's return to concert a [...] "smashing spectacle" [...] creating a [...] "powerful, festival-like feeling". He felt that Thirty Seconds to Mars delivered a [...] "fully committed performance", praising the band's energy on stage, and noticed the [...] "futuristic" [...] production of the show by Linkin Park. Alison Angel, writing for Creative Loafing Charlotte, opined that the tour offered fans a chance to catch [...] "three big rock bands" [...] on a single event and felt that each performance was a [...] "sight to behold". She further said, [...] "between AFI tearing up the stage before the headliners even appeared, to the theatrics in Thirty Seconds to Mars' act and the grand performance of hard-rocking Linkin Park, fans walked out with a <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> moment was truly once in a lifetime."

2500|$|According to the Ahmadiyya view, much of {{the imagery}} {{presented}} in the Qur'an regarding Heaven, but also hell, is in fact metaphorical. They propound the verse which describes, according to them how the life to come after death {{is very different from}} the life here on earth. The Quran says: [...] According to Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the founder of Ahmadiyya sect in Islam, the soul will give birth to another rarer entity and will resemble the life on this earth in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> entity will bear a similar relationship to the soul, as the soul bears relationship with the human existence on earth.

With this, an [...] "embyonic soul" [...] begins to take shape. Different tastes are said to be born which a person given to carnal passions finds no enjoyment. For example, sacrifice of one's own's rights over that of other's becomes enjoyable, or that forgiveness becomes second nature. In such a state a person finds contentment and Peace at heart and at this stage, according to Ahmadiyya beliefs, it can be said that a soul within the soul has begun to take shape.|$|E
2500|$|The first quatrain of the sonnet {{lets the}} reader know the poet has been [...] "infected", in a sense, by his mistress. Though {{the idea of}} being [...] "love-sick" [...] has been often {{idealized}} and romanticized in modern culture, the way the poet describes his lustfulness and want leads to a more dark reading, almost as if he is a host to some sort of sickly desired parasite feeding on his sense and reason. The poet begins the sonnet by linking and treating love and disease as parallel and intricately linked concepts. The poet's mistress has planted a sickly fever within the poet, being a type of bodily love and desire, which is causing an illness within him. His love/lust and wantonness is weakening him to the point where his lust has perhaps taken on its own sort of force and being, much as a fever does, and is now occupying a space in his body. There also appears a never ending cycle, within the first two lines. Carl Atkins points out that , [...] "In this author longing still For that which longer nurseth the disease' is not idle wordplay, but suggests the patient's <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> condition is never going to end".

The common idiom and medical belief of the times was to [...] "feed a cold, starve a fever".|$|E
