I show that by differentiating word- and phrase-level stress rules, one can account for the superficial differences exemplified in (1) above and many of the stipulations suggested by previous scholars. The paper is organized as follows. In section 1, I look at nouns and adjectives and propose a rule that would account for their stress pattern. In section 2, I extend the stress rule to verbs and show the problem this category poses to our generalization. The main proposal of this paper is discussed in section 3.

40|$|Extrametricality {{has played}} an {{important}} role in metrical theory since its beginnings (cf. Liberman and Prince 1977), but its formal representation has been quite varied. Examples of its application to syllables range from a simple diacritic on the syllable (Hayes 1979, 1981) to exclusion of that syllable and its segmental content from the domain of rule application (Inkelas 1989). In the extended bracketed grids theory of Idsardi (1992), extrametricality results from the insertion of a foot edge that leads to exclusion of a syllable from foot structure. While this approach is appealing in its elegance, I argue that it cannot account adequately for the interaction of extrametricality with quantity sensitivity. The argument is based on two languages with the same foot structure — moraic trochees constructed at the right edge of the word — and similar, but importantly distinct, roles for extrametricality. Section 1 outlines Latin stress and extrametricality and its theoretical analysis, while section 2 demonstrates problems that this analysis encounters in treating the similar facts in Manam.

30|$|As for columns bend {{in double}} {{curvature}} modes as groups No. 3 and 4, {{none of them}} developed tensile strain in the longitudinal bars at the mid-height section.

As illustrated in Table  2, it can be noted that increasing the end eccentricities resulted in decreasing the developed compressive strain on the longitudinal bars at the mid-height section due to increase the bending moment effect.|$|R
50|$|When {{the load}} {{is applied to}} a beam the beam has the {{property}} to resist it. When the beam is indeterminate it forms sufficient number of hinges to make itself determinate.

This process of shift of application of moment in the beam is termed as moment redistribution in beam.|$|R
40|$|Natural {{fracture}} {{systems are}} often {{influenced by the}} presence of different layers with contrasting rock mechanical properties. Understanding the distribution of stress between different mechanical layers is essential to the interpretation of fracture networks within these systems. Knowledge of the fracture system’s geometry and spatial distribution is crucial in understanding the planning and development of any fractured reservoir. In this study, stress/strain distributions and deformation patterns in a three layered medium with and without pre-existing fracture set are analysed. Starting from the most simple to a complex configuration, finite element models are used to understand these patterns. Stress distribution in the presence of fractures gives {{a better understanding of the}} type of failures that the rock can undergo. Stress and strain localizations at fracture tips are observed. The study indicates that tensile stresses will result in the fractured layer in response to remote compression alone given sufficient input parameters. In this case, tensile stress arises without the requirement for an additional body force such as internal fluid pressure. Frictional sliding (displacement) causes localization of deformation at the fracture tips. The displacement intensity varies as a function of fracture orientation (?) (?: angle between the fracture strike and the bulk compression orientation). This displacement along the fractures present in the middle layer of the model also impacts the stress distribution within the surrounding layers as well. Any change in the orientation of the remote stress may lead to significant differences in the stress magnitude within the three layers. Similar analyses have been done with increasing complexity and the impact of fracture length, spacing and overlap/underlap between the adjacent fractures are studied. It is observed that all these parameters not only impact the stress and strain distribution within the fractured layer but also have a significant or subtle impact on the surrounding layers. The study also aims to predict if these patterns are localized or if deformation between the fractures is also influenced by these parameters. The scenario with two fractures is therefore used to investigate the influence of one fracture on the other and it is observed that the stresses are compressive in nature and the magnitude is influenced by the fracture spacing and fracture overlap/underlap. The study gives a confirmation on why finite element modelling is one of the better tools to do such an analysis and more importantly that it gives a first-hand understanding of the impact on such a system under external <b>stress.</b> <b>Section</b> Applied GeologyGeoscience & EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A. (MW)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. The overall {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to assess the assertive behaviour of social workers. The dissertation consists of five sections. Section A refers to the problem statement, research objectives and procedures that were followed. Furthermore the limitations of the research report were discussed, definitions of key terms given and the framework of the research report given. The problem statement can be condensed as follows: Social workers are assertive in relation to their client management, but not in relation to their personal needs which are affected within their profession. This can lead to burnout/stress in the social work profession. The problem statement leads to two research aims. "Developmental Research and Utilization"-model (DR&U-model) was used as well as the research model. Literature studies were conducted on the themes of assertive behaviour, burnout and <b>stress.</b> <b>Section</b> B consists of two articles that form the report about research outcomes. Each article is treated as a self-contained entity, which focuses on specific research aims undertaken based on unique research methods. The two articles are: Article 1 : The nature of assertive behaviour The aim of this article is to assess the nature and extent of assertive behaviour. Assertive behaviour is defined and common concepts identified by means of a literature overview. Attention is further given to the nature of burnout as well as the correlation between burnout and assertive behaviour. The influence of assertive behaviour is divided into the psychological influence, physical influence and social influence as well as occupational influence. Several factors influence assertive behaviour. In this regard self-image, norms and values, verbal and non-verbal communication are discussed. Lastly the focus is placed on the importance and role of assertive behaviour in the social work profession. Article 2 : Assertive behaviour of social workers The aim of this article is to assess the nature of assertive behaviour in social workers. Attention is given to social workers' assertive behaviour in general and also individually in relation to their clients, colleagues, supervisor, other professionals and the community. Attention is also given to the extent of burnout social workers are experiencing and the relationship between feelings of burnout and assertive behaviour of social workers. Two self developed questionnaires were distributed to and completed by social workers in the North-West province as measuring instruments which evaluated their assertive behaviour as well as the extent of burnout and job stress these social workers experienced in their different occupational fields. In section C a summary is provided of the most important findings and conclusions of the entire research project. Further recommendations are discussed.

30|$|Inspite {{that the}} maximum <b>stressed</b> <b>section</b> {{was not the}} same for all tested columns {{depending}} on the end eccentricities combinations, the developed normal strains on the longitudinal bars were measured at the mid-height section. Based on the used steel type, the yield strain of the longitudinal bars is 2069 micro-strain. Since the column C- 0 - 0 was short in both directions, i.e., the effect of slenderness is minimal, the developed strains along the entire height of the reinforcing bars should reach the yielding point at failure. That happened, as expected, where the measured compressive strain near failure was 2247 micro-strain for column C- 0 - 0.|$|R

30|$|Estimation of pore-fluid {{pressures}} {{depends on}} the assumed stress pattern, as demonstrated in the previous section. The discrepancy between the assumed and true stress patterns yields modeling errors in the estimation of pore-fluid pressure. Unlike random observation errors, modeling errors will cause biased results in inversion analysis (e.g., Yagi and Fukahata 2008). In this section, we consider the estimation errors of the regional stress pattern (Terakawa et al. 2016) in the FMT analysis. In “Estimation errors of the regional stress field around Mt. Ontake” section, we evaluated the estimation errors of the regional stress pattern using multivariate normal random numbers. In “FMT analysis considering estimation errors of the assumed <b>stress</b> pattern” <b>section,</b> we determined the average value of the pore-fluid pressure triggering each event in the final dataset in “Data for the FMT analysis” section, considering the estimation errors of the assumed stress pattern. Subsequently, we applied the FMT method to these data to estimate the pore-fluid pressure field. Comparing the pore-fluid pressure field in “Pore-fluid pressure field with the regional <b>stress</b> pattern” <b>section</b> with that in “FMT analysis considering estimation errors of the assumed <b>stress</b> pattern” <b>section,</b> we evaluated the level of pore-fluid pressure driving microseismic swarm activity.|$|R

40|$|The growth {{responses}} to osmotic <b>stress</b> of hypocotyl <b>sections</b> of Vigna unguiculata were studied by the xylem perfusion method. Hypocotyl sections shrank upon ex-posure to osmotic <b>stress.</b> <b>Sections</b> showed no adaptive re-sponses to osmotic stress {{when they were}} in an IAA-depleted condition as a result of perfusion with solutions that lacked IAA for 3 - 4 h. The correlation between the growth rate and the membrane potential of the xylem/sym-plast boundary (V*) was very limited in the absence of IAA. By contrast, hypocotyl sections showed distinct adap-tive {{responses to}} osmotic stress after perfusion with solu-tions that contained 10 fiM IAA. In the presence of IAA, V * increased in the negative direction and growth resumed in spite of the osmotic stress. The growth rate was closely correlated with the xylem membrane potential. Hyper-polarization of the membranes of the xylem/symplast boundary always preceded the recovery of growth under osmotic stress. It appears that IAA is essential for the adap-tive recovery of growth under osmotic stress and, more-over, that the xylem proton pump plays an indispensable role in modulating the growth of hypocotyl sections.
