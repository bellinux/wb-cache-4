Because of the {{proximity}} of the M60 motorway and the risk that deep excavations might damage it, seven of the final settling tanks were built above ground.

The upgrade also included five primary settlement tanks and eight sludge consolidation tanks.

500|$|In 1960, {{there was}} {{extensive}} flooding of the Rother Valley, with some [...] inundated, {{and in some}} areas the water did not recede for several months. In 1962 the Kent River Board introduced a bill to Parliament, which would authorise improvements to the river banks, {{with the construction of}} a sluice and associated lock below Rye, to prevent tidal flooding. At the time, the river was used by a fishing fleet of at least ten trawlers, and a freighter of 250 tons used the river for a trade in timber. There was some concern in the House of Lords that the lock would not be large enough to accommodate the freighter, although {{it would be possible to}} open both sets of lock gates when the tide level was suitable. The bill did not become an Act of Parliament, due to lack of parliamentary time, and so the sluice was not constructed. However, the Rother Area Drainage Improvement Scheme began in 1966, and was completed in 1980. This involved raising the level of the floodbanks along much of the river. Those in the Wet Level, an area of [...] between the junction with the Maytham Sewer and Blackwall Bridge, were not raised as much, so that during periods of high flow when the river is tide-locked, the levels can be used for flood storage. The scheme included the installation of 20 pumping stations, which raise water from the low-lying marshes into the embanked river using Archimedes' <b>screw</b> <b>pumps.</b> Some of the drainage ditches in the marshland had to be reconfigured to deliver the water to the pumping stations.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCompared {{with the}} general {{centrifugal}} <b>pump,</b> the <b>screw</b> centrifugal <b>pump</b> has a spiral radial impeller and opening flow passage. The impeller inlet is a spiral blade and outlet of blade looks like to mixing-flow pump blade. Its special structure made the <b>screw</b> <b>pump</b> not only having spiral propelling effect but also having centrifugal effect, therefore the <b>screw</b> centrifugal <b>pump</b> has both the merits of <b>screw</b> <b>pump</b> and centrifugal pump.

Lastly drawing outlet pressure change curves to evaluate the concrete effect of rotational speed on the performance of the pump. The results indicate that the lifting capacity of the pump and pressure bearing capacity of single stage increase with the rotational speed increasing. The centrifugal performance of the full metal single <b>screw</b> <b>pump</b> is more obvious. So it needs to give full consideration to the effect of rotational speed on characteristics of <b>screw</b> <b>pump</b> in the process of <b>screw</b> <b>pump</b> designing and using, especially the selection of pump series and rotational speed.
