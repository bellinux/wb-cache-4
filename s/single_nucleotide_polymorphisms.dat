MethodsTwenty-two patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and three with myelodysplastic syndromes were studied. The G-banding karyotyping and <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphism</b> array analysis (CytoScan® HD) were performed using cells from bone marrow, DNA extracted from mononuclear cells from bone marrow and buccal cells (BC). ResultsThe mean age of the patients studied was 54 years old, and the median age was 55 years (range: 28 – 93). Twelve (48 %) were male and 13 (52 %) female. Ten patients showed abnormal karyotypes (40. 0 %), 11 normal (44. 0 %) and four had no mitosis (16. 0 %). Regarding the results of bone marrow <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphism</b> array analysis: 17 were abnormal (68. 0 %) and eight were normal (32. 0 %). Comparing the two methods, karyotyping identified a total of 17 alterations (8 deletions/losses, 7 trissomies/gains, and 2 translocations) and <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphism</b> array analysis identified a total of 42 alterations (17 losses, 16 gains and 9 copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity). ConclusionIt is possible to standardize <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphism</b> array analysis in acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndromes and compare the results with the abnormalities detected by karyotyping. <b>Single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphism</b> array analysis increased the detection rate of abnormalities compared to karyotyping and also identified a new set of abnormalities that deserve further investigation in future studies...|$|R

25|$|One {{human genome}} was sequenced in full in 2003, and {{currently}} efforts {{are being made}} to achieve {{a sample of the}} genetic diversity of the species (see International HapMap Project). By present estimates, humans have approximately 22,000 genes. The variation in human DNA is very small compared to other species, possibly suggesting a population bottleneck during the Late Pleistocene (around 100,000 years ago), in which the human population was reduced to a small number of breeding pairs. Nucleotide diversity is based on single mutations called <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> (SNPs). The nucleotide diversity between humans is about 0.1%, i.e. 1 difference per 1,000 base pairs. A difference of 1 in 1,000 nucleotides between two humans chosen at random amounts to about 3 million nucleotide differences, since the human genome has about 3 billion nucleotides. Most of these <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> (SNPs) are neutral but some (about 3 to 5%) are functional and influence phenotypic differences between humans through alleles.|$|E

25|$|The CST3 gene {{is located}} in the cystatin locus and {{comprises}} 3 exons (coding regions, as opposed to introns, non-coding regions within a gene), spanning 4.3 kilo-base pairs. It encodes the most abundant extracellular inhibitor of cysteine proteases. It is found in high concentrations in biological fluids and is expressed in virtually all organs of the body (CST3 is a housekeeping gene). The highest levels are found in semen, followed by breastmilk, tears and saliva. The hydrophobic leader sequence indicates that the protein is normally secreted. There are three polymorphisms in the promoter region of the gene, resulting in two common variants. Several <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> have been associated with altered cystatin C levels.|$|E

These are computational techniques, and are in contrast to special experimental methods based on known population-wide <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> (see SNP genotyping). Due to the increasing abundance of NGS data, these techniques are becoming increasingly popular for performing SNP genotyping, {{with a wide variety of}} algorithms designed for specific experimental designs and applications. In addition to the usual application domain of SNP genotyping, these techniques have been successfully adapted to identify rare SNPs within a population, as well as detecting somatic SNVs within an individual using multiple tissue samples.|$|E

25|$|Two large {{genome-wide}} association studies linking <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> (SNPs) to {{prostate cancer}} {{were published in}} 2008. These studies identified several SNPs which substantially affect the risk of prostate cancer. For example, individuals with TT allele pair at SNP rs10993994 were reported to be at 1.6 times higher risk of prostate cancer than those with the CC allele pair. This SNP explains part of the increased prostate cancer risk of African American men as compared to American men of European descent, since the C allele is much more prevalent in the latter; this SNP {{is located in the}} promoter region of the MSMB gene, thus affects the amount of MSMB protein synthesized and secreted by epithelial cells of the prostate.|$|E
25|$|Monozygotic twins, {{although}} genetically very similar, are not genetically {{exactly the}} same. The DNA in {{white blood cells}} of 66 pairs of monozygotic twins was analyzed for 506,786 <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> known to occur in human populations. Polymorphisms appeared in 2 of the 33 million comparisons, leading the researchers to extrapolate that the blood cells of monozygotic twins may have {{on the order of}} one DNA-sequence difference for every 1.2 x 107 nucleotides, which would imply hundreds of differences across the entire genome. The mutations producing the differences detected in this study would have occurred during embryonic cell-division (after the point of fertilization). If they occur early in fetal development, they will be present in a very large proportion of body cells.|$|E

When a person has a disease or health condition, pharmacogenomics can examine an individual’s genetic makeup to determine what medicine and what dosage would be the safest and most beneficial to the patient. In the human population, there are approximately 11 million <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> (SNPs) in people’s genomes, making them the most common variations in the human genome. SNPs reveal information about an individual’s response to certain drugs. This type of genetic testing {{can be used for}} cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.

25|$|In vitro {{studies have}} shown that {{presence}} of a number of <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> in the CA/SP1 cleavage site have resulted in resistance to bevirimat. However, mutations at these sites were not found in phase I and II clinical trials. Instead, mutations in the glutamine-valine-threonine (QVT) motif of the SP1 peptide are also known to cause bevirimat resistance. In addition, V362I mutations have been shown to confer strong resistance to bevirimat, where the S373P and I376V mutations may confer low resistance to bevirimat. A further complication of the use of bevirimat is that, since bevirimat targets the CA/SP1 cleavage site, it could also be used in the treatment of protease inhibitor resistant patients. Except for A364V, mutations in the CA/SP1 cleavage site have showed to result in fitness deficits when combined with protease inhibitor resistance. This proposes that these mutations may develop slowly. It has been shown that protease inhibitor resistance can result in an increase in the occurrence of mutations within the downstream QVT motif.|$|E

500|$|Additionally, Fischbach and {{his colleagues}} are working on the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC), which is {{designed}} to identify genetic factors that increase the risk of autism. [...] Over 100 researchers and 13 universities have interviewed and collected blood samples from more than 2000 families to look for a genetic linkage to autism. The majority of tested individuals have moderate to severe autistic symptoms and do not display high levels of intellectual disability. [...] Additionally, autistic individuals from enrolled SSC families exhibit genetic deletions, duplications, and copy number variants (CNVs) that are not present in unaffected family members. [...] Siblings serve as ideal control groups to identify unique CNVs associated with autism. [...] Although CNVs are rare and are found in only up to 1% autistic individuals, the presence of multiple CNVs in autistic individuals may account for a larger fraction of autism cases. Ultimately, the goal of the SSC is to expand the number of individuals enrolled in the program in hope of identifying penetrant CNVs, small de novo mutations, and <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> that are linked to a higher risk of autism.|$|E
