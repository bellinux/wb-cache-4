40|$|A {{fastener}} {{system is}} provided for securing a component to supporting structure. The fastener system comprises {{a pair of}} cooperating fastener modules. The first module includes a first <b>stationary</b> <b>member</b> attached to the supporting structure and a first bolt member threadedly engaged with the first <b>stationary</b> <b>member.</b> The second module includes a second <b>stationary</b> <b>member</b> also attached to the supporting structure and a second bolt member threadedly engaged with the second <b>stationary</b> <b>member.</b> The second bolt member also extends freely through a longitudinal bore in the first bolt member. Head members on {{the first and second}} head members are mutually engaged for their unitary rotation and the first head member engages the component. When the head members are rotated in one direction, they are advanced toward the supporting structure thereby drawing the component toward the supporting structure. Rotation in the opposite direction is effective to cause the head members to retract from the supporting structure and thereby separate the component from the supporting structure. With this construction, upon fracture either of the first fastener means at a location away from the first head member or of the second fastener means at a location away from the second head member, upon rotation of the first head member in the one direction, the first head member nevertheless continues to advance toward the supporting structure...|$|E
40|$|A thermal {{conduction}} switch includes a thermally-conductive first member having a first thermal contacting structure for securing the first member as a <b>stationary</b> <b>member</b> to a thermally regulated body or a body requiring thermal regulation. A movable thermally-conductive second member has a second thermal contacting surface. A thermally conductive coupler is interposed {{between the first}} member and the second member for thermally coupling the first member to the second member. At least one control spring is coupled between the first member and the second member. The control spring includes a NiTiFe comprising shape memory (SM) material that provides a phase change temperature < 273 K, a transformation range < 40 K, and a hysteresis of < 10 K. A bias spring is between the first member and the second member.

40|$|Part 5 : Distributed ComputingInternational audienceThe {{concept of}} graph-transformational swarms {{is a novel}} {{approach}} that offers a rule-based framework to model discrete swarm methods. This paper continues the research on graph-transformational swarms by focusing on a special type of members called stationary members. The stationary members are assigned to particular subgraphs of the considered environment graphs. Every <b>stationary</b> <b>member</b> is responsible for calculations and transformations at the assigned area, and {{the applicability of the}} member’s rules depends only on this area and not on the whole environment. A further advantage of stationary members is that it is easier to guarantee that they can act in parallel than for moving members. Cloud computing is an engineering topic where swarms with stationary members can be applied in an adequate way, namely, by modeling the nodes of the server network that forms the cloud as stationary members. We illustrate the proposed concept by means of a case study...|$|E
50|$|Now {{there is}} more {{interest}} in superconducting AC synchronous electric machines (alternators and synchronous motors). The direct current electromagnet field winding on the rotor (rotating member) use superconductors but the alternating current multiphase winding set on the stator (<b>stationary</b> <b>members),</b> which have no practical support by superconductors, uses conventional, normal conduction copper conductors. Often the stator conductors are cooled to reduce, but not eliminate, their resistive losses.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIP {{multicast}} {{was initially}} designed for <b>stationary</b> <b>members</b> {{and does not}} consider extra requirements for mobile parties. In fact, to deploy IP multicast, two essential components are required: a membership management protocol to manage the join/leave process, and a routing protocol to build the multicast delivery tree. Currently, multicast membership protocols such as IGMPv 3 and MLDv 2 rely on a periodic forwarding model between the Querier and the receivers. However, when dealing with mobile IP receivers, the periodic queries prohibit mobile hosts from using sleep mode to conserve battery power when no multicast traffic is present. In addition, the home agent (HA) has to implement the IGMP/MLD forwarding functions, and to tunnel periodically membership messages to all remote mobile receivers, which induces a significant processing overhead. To solve this problem, we propose an adaptive solution in which the HA does not periodically transmit membership messages to mobile receiver. We prove by simulation that our solution reduces significantly the amount of membership messages sent through the mobile IP bi-directional tunne...|$|R
40|$|The figure {{depicts a}} micromachined silicon {{vibratory}} gyroscope that senses rotation about its z axis. The rotation-sensitive vibratory element is a post oriented (when at equilibrium) along the z axis and suspended {{at its base}} by thin, flexible silicon bands oriented along the x and y axes, respectively. Unlike in the vibratory microgyroscopes described in the immediately preceding article ["Cloverleaf Vibratory Microgyroscope With Integrated Post" (NPO- 20688) ] and other previous articles in NASA Tech Briefs, the rotation-sensitive vibratory element does not include a cloverleaf-shaped structure that lies (when at equilibrium) in the x-y plane. As {{in the cases of}} the previously reported vibratory microgyroscopes, vibrations of the rotation-sensitive vibratory element are excited electrostatically, the vibrations are measured by use of capacitive proximity sensors, and the rate of rotation along the axis of sensitivity is deduced from the effect of the Coriolis force upon the vibrations. To create electrodes for electrostatic excitation and capacitive sensing of vibrations, portions of the facing surfaces of the post and of the four <b>stationary</b> <b>members</b> that surround the post are rendered electrically conductive; this can be accomplished by either depositing metal films or else doping the silicon in the affected areas...|$|R
40|$|There is {{widespread}} {{interest in the}} nonlinear dynamics of macro-beams and nano/micro-beams as they are essential components of structural assemblies designed for enhanced performance. A recent research effort of the authors pertains to the vibratory response of electrostatically actuated microbeams {{in the presence of}} spatially concentrated, compliant, but stiff, limit constraints. Such devices, when integrated in a microassembly, have been proposed as tunable threshold sensors for which snap-through could be induced, for example, by bursts of acceleration (e. g., Wilcox and Dankowicz [1]). The operating principle of the proposed threshold sensors is the strong destabilizing influence of lowrelative- velocity contact between the microbeam and the constraint on the vibratory steady-state response of the microbeam. Recent results have demonstrated that the onset of contact, for a sufficiently stiff constraint, results in a rapid transient from a relatively-low-amplitude solution with sustained low-velocity contact with the constraint to a relatively-high-amplitude oscillation with larger contact velocities. Indeed, by suitable design of the system parameters, this transition may result in snap-through of the microbeam towards a <b>stationary</b> <b>member</b> of opposite charge, thus shorting a circuit and triggering a suite of appropriate action. While such dynamic snap-through may occur {{even in the absence of}} a stiff constraint, the corresponding critical amplitude becomes a tunable parameter in the presence of the constraint, whereas it is determined by material and electric parameters in its absence...|$|E
40|$|Simultaneous {{measurement}} of electrical contact resistance (ECR) and {{coefficient of friction}} (COF) at the sliding interface is essential to assess the performance of selected material contact pairs for the transfer of current from <b>stationary</b> <b>member</b> to moving member (or vice-versa). Low and stable values of ECR and COF are desirable during the intended operating life of the contact members. These parameters may change with respect to time {{as a consequence of}} change in the surface properties of contact members due to their relative movement. Hence experimental investigations have been conducted to study the variation of ECR and COF while different riders sliding on copper and brass flat samples in different environments. As a part of the experimental investigation, a reciprocating sliding setup is designed and developed to study the variation of ECR and COF in terms of normal force, sliding speed, current and environment. The details of the experimental setup are described along with its construction and operation. The sample preparation, instrumentation, data acquisition and presentation are explained in detail. The variations of ECR and COF at different normal forces, currents and sliding speeds by moving OFHC copper, brass, silver, Ag 10 Cu and Ag 20 Cu riders on OFHC copper and brass flat samples in vacuum, argon, nitrogen and air are studied in detail. Studies are also conducted to evaluate the performance of metallic contacts under lubricated condition using general purpose lubricating oils of different viscosity. Metallic contacts show a decrease in ECR with increase in normal force at all sliding speeds in all media. Sliding metallic contacts show a significant decrease in both ECR and COF during the initial sliding cycles at constant normal force in all media. Surface roughness of flat sample is found to {{have a significant effect on}} both ECR and COF in all media. Wear of rider is found to be significant as compared to wear of flat samples. Metallic contacts show an inverse relationship between ECR and COF in all media under mild wear regime (0. 2 < COF≤ 0. 4). ECR and COF of sliding metallic contacts are independent of current (≤ 4 A) in mild wear regime in all media. Reasonably low values of ECR and COF are observed for prolonged duration with lubricants having low viscosity. The presence of wear fragments at the sliding zone is found to have significant effect on both ECR and COF in all media. Low values of ECR are observed while copper rider sliding on brass sample as compared to silver rider under same operating conditions. Significant amount of metal transfer is observed with silver based riders sliding on copper and brass flat samples in different media. The present investigations are useful in understanding the contact behaviour of copper and brass flat samples for similar and dissimilar riders sliding on them in various environments...|$|E
40|$|An {{optical disk}} buffer concept can provide gigabit-per-second data rates and terabit {{capacity}} {{through the use}} of arrays of solid state lasers applied to a stack of erasable/reusable optical disks. The RCA optical disk buffer has evoked interest by NASA for space applications. The porous graphite air bearings in the rotary spindle as well as those used in the linear translation of the read/write head would be replaced by magnetic bearings or mechanical (ball or roller) bearings. Based upon past experience, roller or ball bearings for the translation stages are not feasible. Unsatisfactory, although limited experience exists with ball bearing spindles also. Magnetic bearings, however, appear ideally suited for both applications. The use of magnetic bearings is advantageous in the optical disk buffer because of the absence of physical contact between the rotating and <b>stationary</b> <b>members.</b> This frictionless operation leads to extended life and reduced drag. The manufacturing tolerances that are required to fabricate magnetic bearings would also be relaxed from those required for precision ball and gas bearings. Since magnetic bearings require no lubricant, they are inherently compatible with a space (vacuum) environment. Magnetic bearings also allow the dynamics of the rotor/bearing system to be altered {{through the use of}} active control. This provides the potential for reduced vibration, extended regions of stable operation, and more precise control of position...|$|R

40|$|LecturePg. 95 - 102 The use of {{abradable}} and rub tolerant polymer seals {{to reduce}} leakage between rotating and <b>stationary</b> <b>members</b> in centrifugal compressors and steam turbines has {{increased over the}} years. Abradable materials such as mica-filled tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), nickel graphite, and aluminum alloy containing silicon/polyester are {{the most commonly used}} and have gained acceptance in the marketplace. This paper highlights the development of anew abradable silicon rubber adhesively bonded to a metal substrate. The abradability of the material was found to be excellent with no damage to the rotating member. For rub tolerant polymer seals little data are available on the effects of an aggressive rub with relation to deflection and wear at various temperatures. A series of test was done on labyrinth seals manufactured from various forms of carbon fill polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and polyamideimide (PAI). these test evaluated their mechanical performance at low temperatures, room temperatures, and high temperatures. The results of the tests indicated that at room temperature and low temperatures, the seals exhibited acceptable deflection properties without damage to the rotating shaft and minimal material loss from the labyrinth teeth. However, at high temperatures of 150 ?F, the PAI material had greater deflection values than the two types of PEEK, which resulted in the PAI exhibiting greater tooth height loss compared to the PEEK materials. For steam turbines, nickel chrome and nickel graphite were tested in a steam turbine and results are highlighted. This paper also shows the efficiency improvement for applying abradable seals to centrifugal compressors and steam turbines...|$|R

A spiral tubular member encircles the inner concentric cylinder and is contained within the space between the inner and outer cylinders. One portion is connected to the inner concentric cylinder and a second portion connected to the outer concentric cylinder. A heated fluid is conveyed through the tubular member and is periodically cooled causing the tubular member to expand and contract.

40|$|A plasma sprayed dual density ceramic {{abradable}} seal system for direct {{application to the}} HPT seal shroud of small gas turbine engines. The system concept {{is based on the}} thermal barrier coating and depends upon an additional layer of modified density ceramic material adjacent to the gas flow path to provide the desired abradability. This is achieved by codeposition of inert fillers with yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) to interrupt the continuity of the zirconia struture. The investigation of a variety of candidate fillers, with hardness values as low as 2 on Moh's scale, led to the conclusion that solid filler materials in combination with a YSZ matrix, regardless of their hardness values, have a propensity for compacting rather than shearing as originally expected. The observed compaction is accompanied by high energy dissipation in the rub interaction, usually resulting in the adhesive transfer of blade material to the <b>stationary</b> seal <b>member.</b> Two YSZ based coating systems which incorported hollow alumino silicate spheres as density reducing agents were surveyed over the entire range of compositions from 100 percent filler to 100 percent YSZ.
