Apart from these bridge repair actions the works also included the placementof additional architectural elements such as viewpoints on the bridge, the supply and placement of lighting, bank access steps and the construction of two decorative arches. The Freyssinet company was awarded the contract to reconstruct the Mitrovica Bridge. The contract's terms stipulated that Freyssinet hire a multi-ethnic construction team to rebuild the bridge. In September 2000 the 61 workers from Kosovo were chosen - one Albanian for one Serb. The project manager was Pierre Lottici. The Department of Transport and Infrastructure - a division of the UNMIK Joint Interim Administrative Structure (JIAS) - oversaw the bridge contract. At the end of June 2001, the new DM 3 million Mitrovica Bridge was handed over to the City of Mitrovica.|$|E

The core optimizations of TxCF-Tree’s operations are: providing a traversal phase {{that does not}} use any lock and/or speculation, and deferring the lock acquisition or physical modification to the transaction’s commit phase; isolating the <b>structural</b> <b>operations</b> (such as re-balancing) in an interference-less housekeeping thread; and minimizing the interference between <b>structural</b> <b>operations</b> and the critical path of semantic operations (i. e., additions and removals on the tree).

40|$|Hajek and Sasaki showed that, for {{continuous}} traffic and packet radio network, {{the selection of}} paths that minimize the maximum nodal degree generates schedules of minimum-length. This result suggests that minimization of the maximum nodal degree provides good (although not necessarily optimal) performance in slotted networks with fixed-length packets. In this paper, we give a multispace search algorithm that inter-plays <b>structural</b> <b>operations</b> {{in conjunction with a}} local search algorithm for the minimization of the maximum nodal degree. <b>Structural</b> <b>operations</b> disturb the environment of forming local minima, which makes multispace search a very natural approach to the problem.

To avoid this intractability we present a new approach to logicbased abduction; through the geometrical view of data employed in array-based logic we embrace abduction in a simple <b>structural</b> <b>operation.</b> We argue that a theory of abduction on this form allows for an implementation which, at runtime, can perform abductive inference quite efficiently on arbitrary rules of logic representing knowledge of finite domains. ...|$|R

40|$|Induction is {{the process}} by which we obtain {{predictive}} laws or theories or models of the world. We consider the structural aspect of induction. We answer the question as to whether we can find a finite and minmalistic set of operations on structural elements in terms of which any theory can be expressed. We identify abstraction (grouping similar entities) and super-structuring (combining topologically e. g., spatio-temporally close entities) as the essential <b>structural</b> <b>operations</b> in the induction process. We show that only two more <b>structural</b> <b>operations,</b> namely, reverse abstraction and reverse super-structuring (the duals of abstraction and super-structuring respectively) suffice in order to exploit the full power of Turing-equivalent generative grammars in induction. We explore the implications of this theorem with respect to the nature of hidden variables, radical positivism and the 2 -century old claim of David Hume about the principles of con-nexion among ideas. ...|$|E

40|$|Current {{research}} in autonomic computing {{suffers from the}} lack of a common definition of the basic autonomic entities. Defining and developing the basic autonomic entities and making it publicly available would greatly simplify prototyping of different self-management techniques and permit autonomic techniques to be compared and benchmarked. Although different aspects of autonomic computing are explored in isolation, the <b>structural</b> <b>operation</b> of an autonomic element itself has not been completely modeled. This paper presents a self regulating design of an autonomic element in a distributed object environment. The goal of this architectural design is to provide an easy to program autonomic element which can be implemented in most domains with only minor modifications. Profiling and experimentation with this design shows that it is lightweight and performs smoothly without causing deadlock (since all internal communication and data structures are deadlock resistant) or producing excessive overhead...|$|R
