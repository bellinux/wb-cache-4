England then lost 8/25 and Miller {{finished}} with 4/91 as England were bowled out for 247 {{in their first}} innings. Miller came in to bat at 4/35 on a wet wicket and lofted Laker for a six, before proceeding to sweep anything that the off spinner delivered on a leg stump line. This helped Australia recover to 202, 45runs in arrears, with Miller top-scoring with 61. He took another the wicket of Sheppard in the second innings as England made 3/182 across several rain-interrupted days, before May declared and set Australia 228 to win in two hours. Australia collapsed again and Miller came in for his last Test innings in England at 3/5. He ended unbeaten on seven when stumps were drawn at 5/27, after batting defensively for 66 minutes. The series ended 12. He ended the series with 201runs at 22.55 and topped the bowling with 21wickets at 22.23.|$|E

Convexity in prices and concavity in quasi-fixed factors of the restricted profit function are simultaneously imposed using Bayesian techniques. The empirical model is dlsaggregated in the input side, utilizes a Fuss-quadratic flexible functional form, incorporates the impact of agricultural policies, and introduces a new weather index. The methodology is applied to Illinois’s agriculture, and implications for agriculture in the Corn Belt and the Northeast are briefly dkcussed. Measuring ease of substitutability between produc-tion factors is of practical and theoretical impor-tance in economics. Many pessimistic predictions of natural-resource depletion proved to be grossly incorrect because the models used failed to recog-nize important substitution relationships (Field and Bemdt). Concerns over ground- and surface-water quality, food safety, land retirement, and altern-ativeproduction systems call for quantitative as-sessments of the effect of changing market condi-tions or government policies on the demand for agricultural inputs. In U. S. agriculture, it is par-ticularly important to assess policy alternatives tar-geted to limit the use of fertilizers and pesticides (chemical inputs), which have contributed to the contamination of water resources and to the pres-ence of toxic residues in food. Groundwater con-tamination is particularly serious in areas with high application rates of nitrogen or mobile pesticides, shallow water tables, and permeable, coarse-textured <b>soils</b> (<b>Miller).</b> About 10 % of the nation’s 3, 000 counties, located chiefly in the Upper Mid-west and East, have been identified to have poten-tial for contamination of groundwater by both ni-trates and pesticides (Lee).

40|$|The {{representation}} of soil water movement exposes uncertainties in all model components. We assess the key uncertainties {{for the specific}} hydraulic situation of a 1 -D soil profile with TDR (time domain reflectometry) -measured water contents. The uncertainties addressed are initial condition, soil hydraulic parameters, small-scale heterogeneity, upper boundary condition, and the local equilibrium assumption by the Richards equation. We employ an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) with an augmented state to represent and estimate all key uncertainties, except for the intermittent violation of the local equilibrium assumption. For the latter, we introduce a closed-eye EnKF to bridge the gap. Due to an iterative approach, the EnKF was capable of estimating <b>soil</b> parameters, <b>Miller</b> scaling factors and upper boundary condition based on TDR measurements during a single rain event. The introduced closed-eye period ensured constant parameters, suggesting that they resemble the believed true material properties. This closed-eye period improves predictions during periods when the local equilibrium assumption is met, but requires {{a description of the}} dynamics during local non-equilibrium phases to be able to predict them. Such a description remains an open challenge. Finally, for the given representation our results show the necessity of including small-scale heterogeneity. A simplified representation with Miller scaling already yielded a satisfactory description...|$|R
30|$|Post-wildfire {{maps are}} created from {{remotely}} sensed data {{as soon as}} the fire is out to capture immediate post-fire conditions of soils and vegetation. These maps are commonly referred to as burn severity maps and are primarily used to assist rapid-response Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) teams in assessing the immediate and long-term fire effects on vegetation, soil, and related ecological processes (Lentile et al. 2006). Standard burn severity mapping methodologies are based on classification of spectral indices (such as the Normalized Burn Ratio, or NBR) calculated from differenced pre- and post-fire multispectral satellite imagery (Key and Benson 2006, Clark et al. 2003). For these post-fire maps, the landscape is classified into categories of unburned, low, moderate, and high burn severity, corresponding to the magnitude of change in the post-wildfire appearance of vegetation, litter, and <b>soil</b> (<b>Miller</b> and Yool 2002, Lentile et al. 2006, Lutes et al. 2006).|$|E
30|$|Figure 3 (c) {{shows the}} {{moisture}} content variation in m 3 /m 3 near the weather station at Mizusawa Observatory, measured every 5 min with a {{soil moisture meter}} (Profile Probe PR 2; Delta-T Devices Ltd.). This meter observes voltage changes at six sensors, and converts these voltages into an overall moisture change by using the conversion equation for organic <b>soil</b> (<b>Miller</b> and Gaskin, 1999). In this figure, θobs(t) (solid line) signifies the average moisture from the six observations at 0 – 1 -m depth below the ground surface, and Δθobs(t) (gray envelope) is the 1 -σ error range for the observed moisture. The absolute moisture value is 0.40 ∼ 0.55, and {{is consistent with the}} value found by a soil test (Grossman and Reinsch, 2002) of 0.51 ± 0.04 on 8 November, 2008. θobs(t) increases sharply at rainfall events dependent on the amount of rain, and decreases exponentially after rainfall because of evapotranspiration and infiltration. However, the moisture level is approximately constant during the winter seasons (from December to April), suggesting that the covering snow blocks evapotranspiration from the soil surface and the covering snow provides moisture to the soil at a constant rate.|$|E
30|$|The 2003 {{southern}} California wildfires burned ∼ 300, 000 ha, much {{of which}} was in chaparral vegetation that has a more open canopy and less litter accumulation {{on the ground as}} compared to a typical coniferous forest. These conditions are {{due in part to the}} rocky soils in the area and relatively low rainfall that prevent vegetation from becoming dense, except in segregated patches. These vegetation patterns create a unique situation when classifying the severity of the fire using a differenced index such as dNBR (differenced normalized burn ratio) that is dependent on the magnitude of change from pre- to post-fire condition (Miller and Thode 2007). Where vegetation is sparse, the complete removal of vegetation due to fire will be classified as high burn severity, even though the relative change to the pre-fire condition and the soil effects on the soil are less severe than similarly classified burned non-chaparral systems. This potentially leads to unnecessary erosion mitigation efforts based on the calculated change in reflectance, rather than the physical alteration of the <b>soil.</b> <b>Miller</b> and Thode (2007) have recently proposed a new index, the Relative dNBR (RdNBR) that takes into account the relative pre-fire to post-fire change in amount of vegetation across the landscape. They suggest that this relative index may be more appropriate than the dNBR for mapping sparse vegetation or mixed vegetation types.|$|E
30|$|Soil {{microbiota}} communities play {{crucial role}} in maintaining the soil ecological balance {{as well as the}} sustainability of both natural ecosystem and agro-ecosystem. Beneficial rhizospheric microbe-plant interactions have a great influence on plant health and soil quality (Wu et al. 2008). Among these beneficial rhizospheric microbes, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and plant-growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) can be considered. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are obligate symbionts that colonise the roots of most cultivated plant species. Mycorrhizal symbiosis can be found in nearly all types of eco-logical situations and most plant species are able to form this symbiosis naturally (Gong et al. 2012). These associations occur naturally when plantlets are transplanted into the field, favouring plant development by increasing nutrient uptake, growth rates and hormonal activities (del Carmen Jaizme-Vega et al. 2006; Chandanie et al. 2009). Mycorrhizae may also increase plant tolerance to stress conditions such as salinity and drought (Latef and He 2011), heavy metals (Tian et al. 2013), root <b>soil</b> borne pathogens (<b>Miller</b> and Jastrow 1992) and the improvement of soil structure (Matthiasc et al. 2010).|$|R
30|$|It is well {{accepted}} that fire can adversely affect surface soil properties and alter the spatial patterns of soil resources (Allen and Steers 2011, Sankey et al. 2012 a, Sankey et al. 2012 b). This {{is important for}} predicting erosion and revegetation, but conducting post-fire surveys of soil conditions are expensive and often challenging to complete in a timely manner. It is typical to utilize soil surveys to obtain properties related to erosion and revegetation potential and other characteristics (US National Park Service 2006). Soil maps are thus a critical component for post-fire planning and assessment. For example, soil burn severity assessments are commonly linked with existing models that predict post-fire hydrology and erosion using soil property information (Parsons et al. 2010). Numerous models {{have been used to}} predict erosion and debris flow following fire including WEPP (Laflen et al. 1997), GeoWEPP (Renschler 2003), ERMiT (Robichaud et al. 2007), and Ravel RAT (Fu 2004), all of which require <b>soil</b> property inputs (<b>Miller</b> et al. 2016). In most cases, conventional soil maps like STATSGO 2 and SSURGO are used to derive these inputs; however, digital soil maps can provide more detailed information with spatially explicit representations of model confidence that can subsequently be incorporated into landscape models.|$|R
40|$|The {{considerable}} {{spatial variability}} of soils makes {{the possibility of}} making teoric models of survey and representation difficult. Nowadays, traditional surveys and others using the application of new technologies are still {{the best way to}} mark soils in a specific area. One main difference is that with the first methods, (openings of profiles, drillings, chemical analysis) is very expansive to do measurements in all the points of a particular site, and these expenditures are not sustainable by normal research centres and in general by public spending while, with the second methods there is a considerable reduction in prices. In the thesis's work the two different applied methodologies have been faced with different survey scale. In particular: with a very detailed scale the EMI (Induced ElectroMagnetism) technology has been used. This technology has the prerogative of being a forwarding method in mapping pedological variations, without any inconveniences neither to the structure nor to the dynamic character of the <b>soil</b> (Godwin and <b>Miller,</b> 2003; McBratney et al., 2003; Sommer et al., 2003). For the semi-detailed scale the area of Foglio Geologico Italia 549 - Muravera�is been chosen with a scale 1 : 50. 000 Geopedological indications are from many executed profiles (66), and they have been used to value the spatial variability to a little scale and to represent with the Pedolandscape chart, with a scale of 1 : 50. 000. The purpose is the management and visualization of obtained data in a synthetic way, and a geographic information system (GIS) is been predisposed to this. ...|$|R
30|$|It {{has often}} been {{observed}} that N uptake by plants in biochar amended soils is low and therefore it is required to supplement biochar amended soils with N fertilizer for improved crop growth (Lehmann et al. 2003; Asai et al. 2009). Nitrogen concentrations in leaves of the seedlings and scions, and total N uptake measured {{at the end of}} the experiment suggests that for Hevea nursery plants, application of biochar did not have any significant negative effect either on N nutritional status (Table 3) or on total N uptake (Figure 1). Leaf P concentrations in both seedlings and scions were not significantly affected by treatments suggesting either P availability in the soil has not been increased or plants were in the optimum P status or higher. In several previous experiments also we have noticed that Hevea nursery plants grown in these soils did not respond to currently recommended P levels in these soils. These soils are high in Fe and Al oxides and posses a very high P fixation capacity (Silva et al. 1977). However, significantly high total P uptake in biochar[*]+[*]N-Mg treatments suggests that P acquisition by plants were more efficient in these treatments. Roots of Hevea plants can form associations with exotic vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae species (Jayaratne et al. 1984). The application of biochar could have promoted colonization of mycorrhizae species (Warnock et al. 2007), probably due to changes in N/P ratios in the <b>soil</b> (<b>Miller</b> et al. 2002), resulting an efficient P uptake even in low available P soils.|$|E
30|$|For {{many species}} of plants that have seeds {{dispersed}} by gravity or wind after fire, the highest likelihood of establishment is from those seeds that land on bare mineral <b>soil</b> (<b>Miller</b> 2000). Reasons for this include improved moisture and nutrient availability, decreased competition, and destruction of allelopathic chemicals in plant litter that inhibit germination. Schimmel and Granström (1996) reported that aerial seeders are favored by seed beds {{with a high degree}} of organic matter consumption, while the results of Zasada et al. (1983) are more extreme. They described the results of artificial seeding on experimentally burned sites in interior Alaska upland black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] Britton, Sterns & Poggenb.) and feathermoss (Hypnaceae) stands. In three burn units with differing burn severity (and, thus, duff consumption levels), a fixed number of seeds of eight native woody species were sown onto 1 m 2 plots in October or June, depending on the timing of their natural dispersal date. Seeded species included paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.), alder (Alnus viridis [Chaix] DC ssp. crispa [Aiton] Turrill), black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] Britton, Sterns & Poggenb.), aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), balsam poplar (P. balsamifera L.), feltleaf willow (Salix alaxensis [Andersson] Coville), Scouler willow (S. scouleriana Barratt ex Hook.), and Bebb willow (S. bebbiana Sarg.). By the third year, of the 1322 seedlings still alive on experimental blocks, 1316 were growing on the heavily burned seed beds. Improved models of organic layer consumption that include bare mineral soil seed bed creation would enhance our ability to model the establishment from seeds (e.g., Miyanishi and Johnson 2002).|$|E
40|$|Many of the {{advantages}} conferred to plants by arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) are associated {{to the ability of}} AM plants to explore a greater volume of soil through the extraradical mycelium. Sieverding (1991) estimates that for each centimetre of colonized root there is an increase of 15 cm 3 on the volume of soil explored, this value can increase to 200 cm 3 depending on the circumstances. Due to the enhancement of the volume of soil explored and the ability of the extraradical mycelium to absorb and translocate nutrients to the plant, one of the most obvious and important advantages resulting from mycorrhization is the uptake of nutrients. Among of which the ones that have immobilized forms in soil, such as P, assume particular significance. Besides this, many other benefits are recognized for AM plants (Gupta et al, 2000) : water stress alleviation (Augé, 2004; Cho et al, 2006), protection from root pathogens (Graham, 2001), tolerance to toxic heavy metals and phytoremediation (Audet and Charest, 2006; Göhre and Paszkowski, 2006), tolerance to adverse conditions such as very high or low temperature, high salinity (Sannazzaro et al, 2006), high or low pH (Yano and Takaki, 2005) or better performance during transplantation shock (Subhan et al, 1998). The extraradical hyphae also stabilize soil aggregates by both enmeshing <b>soil</b> particles (<b>Miller</b> e Jastrow, 1992) and producing a glycoprotein, golmalin, which may act as a glue-like substance to adhere soil particles together (Wright and Upadhyaya, 1998). Despite the ubiquous distribution of mycorrhizal fungi (Smith and Read, 2000) and only a relative specificity between host plants and fungal isolates (McGonigle and Fitter, 1990), the obligate nature of the symbiosis implies the establishment of a plant propagation system, either under greenhouse conditions or in vitro laboratory propagation. These techniques result in high inoculum production costs, which still remains a serious problem since they are not competitive with production costs of phosphorus fertilizer. Even if farmers understand the significance of sustainable agricultural systems, the reduction of phosphorus inputs by using AM fungal inocula alone cannot be justified except, perhaps, in the case of high value crops (Saioto and Marumoto, 2002). Nurseries, high income horticulture farmers and no-agricultural application such as rehabilitation of degraded or devegetated landscapes are examples of areas where the use of commercial inoculum is current. Another serious problem is quality of commercial available products concerning guarantee of phatogene free content, storage conditions, most effective application methods and what types to use. Besides the information provided by suppliers about its inoculum can be deceiving, as from the usually referred total counts, only a fraction may be effective for a particular plant or in specific soil conditions. Gianinazzi and Vosátka (2004) assume that progress should be made towards registration procedures that stimulate the development of the mycorrhizal industry. Some on-farm inoculum production and application methods have been studied, allowing farmers to produce locally adapted isolates and generate a taxonomically diverse inoculum (Mohandas et al, 2004; Douds et al, 2005). However the inocula produced this way are not readily processed for mechanical application to the fields, being an obstacle to the utilization in large scale agriculture, especially row crops, moreover it would represent an additional mechanical operation with the corresponding economic and soil compaction costs. It is well recognized that inoculation of AM fungi has a potential significance in not only sustainable crop production, but also environmental conservation. However, the status quo of inoculation is far from practical technology that can be widely used in the field. Together a further basic understanding of the biology and diversity of AM fungi is needed (Abbott at al, 1995; Saito and Marumoto, 2002). Advances in ecology during the past decade have led to a much more detailed understanding of the potential negative consequences of species introductions and the potential for negative ecological consequences of invasions by mycorrhizal fungi is poorly understood. Schwartz et al, (2006) recommend that a careful assessment documenting the need for inoculation, and the likelihood of success, should be conducted prior to inoculation because inoculations are not universally beneficial. Agricultural practices such as crop rotation, tillage, weed control and fertilizer apllication all produce changes in the chemical, physical and biological soil variables and affect the ecological niches available for occupancy by the soil biota, influencing in different ways the symbiosis performance and consequently the inoculum development, shaping changes and upset balance of native populations. The molecular biology tools developed in the latest years have been very important for our perception of these changes, ensuing awareness of management choice implications in AM development. In this context, for extensive farming systems and regarding environmental and economic costs, the identification of agronomic management practices that allow controlled manipulation of the fungal community and capitalization of AM mutualistic effect making use of local inoculum, seem to be a wise option for mycorrhiza promotion and development of sustainable crop production...|$|R
