5|$|In a 16 December statement, three Stabæk Fotball {{officials}} said that they suspected that Ulrichen's plan all along was to convert the venue to a pure convention center, and that the use as a football venue was a decoy to get a free lot worth up to NOK200 million plus grants worth NOK50 million. The book value of the venue was NOK303 million {{at the end of}} 2010, although a <b>statement</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> district court stated that the value of the venue was significantly lower than that. The bank DnB NOR held at the time a mortgage with security in the property worth NOK260 million, while Ulrichsen through his investment company held a mortgage worth NOK60.1 million.|$|E
5|$|By the afternoon, the {{majority}} of Soyuz members favoured an immediate vote. The Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Anatoly Lukyanov, had already departed for Novo Ogarevo {{to take part in}} constitutional negotiations and he promised to tell Gorbachev about the vote. In his place stood Ivan Laptev, a pro-Gorbachev reformer, who did not trust Lukyanov and tried to stall the vote by demanding a <b>statement</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> KGB, Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence. According to Laptev, the mood was such that if a vote had been taken Pavlov would have won. At the time, both the Soviet secret police and the military establishment in general wanted to strengthen the authority of the Soviet Government and so they too supported Pavlov's program. Soyuz, through a vote, was able to increase the powers of the Cabinet of Ministers, and gave the institution the right of legislative initiative.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of Mora's death, the {{organization}} he worked with cancelled beach patrol efforts in Costa Rica. His death attracted international attention, including a <b>statement</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> United Nations and multiple rewards {{for information on the}} case. In Costa Rica, his death led to calls for reform of environmental policy. On June 4, the government met with environmentalists to discuss potential changes to policy. A plan submitted by environmentalists and endorsed by Environment Minister René Castro would set up a new protected area and grant park rangers more authority to stop poachers, among other changes. On June 5, vigils were held across Costa Rica in honor of Mora. On June 18, the government announced the allocation of ₡20 million (US$40,000), which was later upped to ₡30 million (US$60,000), to memorialize Mora.|$|E
5|$|On 22 April, Abu Nuwar {{issued a}} radio <b>statement</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Cairo-based Voice of the Arabs radio station denouncing Hussein. In {{coordination}} with Abu Nuwar, the following day, a Patriotic Congress composed of Hussein's opposition {{was held in}} Nablus in the West Bank demanding major palace officials be dismissed, expulsion of the American ambassador and military attaché, rejection of the Eisenhower Doctrine, federal unity with Egypt and Syria and reinstatement of the dismissed army officers, including Abu Nuwar. As {{a result of the}} congress, Hussein put Nablus, Jerusalem and Amman under military curfew, dissolved political parties, imposed press censorship, dismissed municipal councils in the West Bank in favor of military governors, disbanded Palestinian-dominated army units, arrested al-Nabulsi (who had since been made foreign minister) and dismissed the cabinet of Prime Minister Fakhri al-Khalidi. Although he eventually relaxed some of these measures, namely military curfews and severe press censorship, Hussein's moves significantly curtailed the constitutional democracy that existed in Jordan in the mid-1950s.|$|E
