5|$|In 1935, Raymond's {{office had}} {{accepted}} {{a commission to}} design a dormitory for the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry, part of French India in southeast India. A preliminary site visit was made by George Nakashima and the schematic design was completed in 1936. Although Raymond had envisioned that the dormitory would be completed in six months, Sri Aurobindo was concerned that the noise of construction would disturb the ashram, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> that the building would be constructed by its residents.|$|E
5|$|When Dave Rosten, another Sydney evangelist, {{attempted}} to imitate Jenner's method of evangelism, he was {{punched in the}} midriff by the first person he spoke to, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> that Jenner's approach to evangelism was not for others to emulate. In 1947, Jenner asked his question to a man named Angus Carruthers, who responded {{that he was a}} Christian and going to heaven. Jenner invited Carruthers back to his home, where Carruthers met Jenner's daughter, Ann. Carruthers and Ann married three years later.|$|E

5|$|Every {{night after}} shooting, editor Colin Goudie and his {{assistant}} Justin Hall would download the footage so the memory sticks could be cleared and {{ready for the next}} day. While new footage was being captured, the previously filmed footage was edited at the production team's hotel. After filming concluded, the crew had over 100 hours of footage. The original cut was over four hours long but was trimmed to 94 minutes after eight months of editing. Edwards originally had the ending of the film both at the beginning and the end. He and the film's producers disagreed about the placement, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> to put the chronological ending of the film {{at the beginning and end}} the film immediately after Andrew and Samantha kiss.|$|E

5|$|In September 1989, Peterson outbid two challengers {{to acquire}} Stereo Super Stores, whose parent company had filed for {{bankruptcy}} the month before, paying $940,000 plus another $1,000,000 for inventory. The acquisition included a car stereo specialty shop at Mall 205, Car Stereo East. Peterson continued to operate the franchise's locations at Jantzen Beach and Washington Square Too without a branding change until March 1991, when he renamed them Tom Peterson Super Stores, as he did his original home electronics store at 82nd and Foster. Peterson explained that the original stores were performing better than the newly acquired outlets, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> to combine them. His other two stores and car specialty store were unaffected.|$|E

Kerry studied at a feeder program for Disney animators at CalArts, and became interested in 2-D computer animation. While there, he {{realized that it was}} possible to apply some of the techniques associated with animation to live-action. Conran had been out of film school for two years and was trying to figure out how to make a movie.

5|$|Tripathi had {{initially}} {{decided to write}} a book on the philosophy of evil, but was dissuaded by his family members, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> {{to write a book}} on Shiva, one of the Hindu Gods. He decided to base his story on a radical idea that all Gods were once human beings; it was their deeds in the human life that made them famous as Gods. After finishing writing The Immortals of Meluha, Tripathi faced rejection from many publication houses. Ultimately when his agent decided to publish the book himself, Tripathi embarked on a promotional campaign. It included posting a live-action video on YouTube, and making the first chapter of the book available as a free digital download, to entice readers.|$|E

At Williams College, he came near to being expelled after arguing with a teacher. After Williams College, he considered being a lawyer, businessman or government worker. His brother William advised against his becoming a government worker or businessman, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> to become a minister. He attended the Princeton Theological Seminary starting in October 1834 and continuing for three years. Here he also came near to being expelled after a dispute with the teacher John Breckenridge.

5|$|After {{a period}} within the sangha, Koṇḍañña retired to the Himalayas {{for the last}} twelve years of his life. This is {{attributed}} to two reasons in Buddhist literature. The first reason was that Koṇḍañña considered his presence {{to be a source}} of inconvenience for Sariputra and Moggallana, the two chief disciples of The Buddha. As the seniormost member of the sangha, Koṇḍañña lead the monks on the alms-round, but during dharma talks, the two chief disciples sat on either side of the Buddha and Koṇḍañña behind them. The two chief disciples were uncomfortable sitting in front of Koṇḍañña, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> to solve the problem by absenting himself. The other reason to which Koṇḍañña's leave is attributed was to spend more quiet time in religious practice, which was rendered difficult due to the attention that the sangha gained from the public.|$|E
5|$|As Sercey left Batavia {{he turned}} eastward along the {{northern}} coast of Java to avoid the British commander in the region, Admiral Peter Rainier who was escorting four ships through the Straits of Malacca to the west. However six East Indiamen were sailing to transit the Bali Strait {{on their way to}} China. On 28 January, {{at the entrance to the}} Strait, Sercey's squadron and the East Indiamen met. The EIC Commodore, James Farquharson, captain of , knew that if he fled the French would rapidly overwhelm his ships <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> to try a bluff. He would attempt to lead Sercey into believing that the convoy was formed not from lightly armed East Indiamen, but from the powerful ships of the line that the Indiamen resembled. Farquharson ordered his ships to advance in line of battle.|$|E
5|$|In April 1337, Montagu was {{appointed}} to a diplomatic commission to Valenciennes, to establish alliances with Flanders and the German princes. In July 1338, he accompanied the king on another mission to the continent, again providing {{the greatest number of}} soldiers, with 123 men-at-arms and 50 archers. In September of that year he was made Marshal of England. After the death of Thomas of Brotherton, Earl of Norfolk, this office had come into the hands of Norfolk's daughter Margaret. The king did not trust the office with her husband, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> instead to bestow it on his trusted companion, Montagu. Edward's policy of building alliances put him in great debt, and when he left the Low Countries to return to England late in 1338, Salisbury had to stay behind as surety to the king's debtors, along with the king's family and the Earl of Derby. The earl had earlier voiced concerns about the costly alliances, but he nevertheless remained loyal to the king's strategy.|$|E

5|$|On 5 September, Emden {{entered the}} Bay of Bengal, {{achieving}} complete surprise, since the British assumed {{she was still}} with Spee's squadron. She operated on shipping routes there without success, until 10 September, when {{she moved to the}} Colombo–Calcutta route. There, she captured the Greek collier Pontoporros, which was carrying equipment for the British. Müller took the ship into his service and agreed to pay the crew. Emden captured five more ships; four were sunk, and the fifth, a steamer named Kabinga, was used to carry the crews from the other vessels. On 13 September, Müller released Kabinga and sank two more British prizes. Off the Ganges estuary, Emden caught a Norwegian merchantman; upon searching her, the Germans determined she was not carrying contraband and therefore released her. The Norwegians informed Müller that Entente warships were operating in the area, and <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> to return to the eastern coast of India.|$|E
5|$|Parsons, the Enola Gays weaponeer, was {{concerned}} about the possibility of an accidental detonation if the plane crashed on takeoff, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> not to load the four cordite powder bags into the gun breech until the aircraft was in flight. Parsons and his assistant, Second Lieutenant Morris R. Jeppson, made their way into the bomb bay along the narrow catwalk on the port side. Jeppson held a flashlight while Parsons disconnected the primer wires, removed the breech plug, inserted the powder bags, replaced the breech plug, and reconnected the wires. Before climbing to altitude on approach to the target, Jeppson switched the three safety plugs between the electrical connectors of the internal battery and the firing mechanism from green to red. The bomb was then fully armed. Jeppson monitored the bomb's circuits.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before dawn}} on 10 April, the five destroyers of the British 2nd Destroyer Flotilla {{surprised}} the German ships in Narvik harbor. They torpedoed two destroyers and badly damaged {{the other three}} while suffering only minor damage themselves. As they were beginning to withdraw they encountered the three destroyers of the 4th Flotilla which had been alerted when the British began their attack. The Germans opened fire first, but the gunnery for both sides was not effective due to the mist and the smoke screen laid by the British as they retreated down the Ofotfjord. The German ships had to turn away to avoid a salvo of three torpedoes fired {{by one of the}} destroyers in Narvik. Commander Bey's other two ships were very low on fuel and all three were running low on ammunition, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> not to continue the pursuit of the British ships since they were being engaged by the last two destroyers of Group 1.|$|E

5|$|The Oklahoma City Thunder is an American {{professional}} basketball franchise based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. It {{plays in the}} Northwest Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). It {{was known as the}} Seattle SuperSonics from 1967 to 2008. The team plays its home games at the Chesapeake Energy Arena. As of October 2008, the Thunder is currently owned by Professional Basketball Club LLC and coached by Billy Donovan, with Sam Presti as its general manager. The team was formed in 1967. After spending 41seasons in Seattle, Washington, the SuperSonics moved to Oklahoma City. Owner Clay Bennett, who purchased the team in 2006, sought to get public funding for a new arena in Seattle, or a major renovation of the KeyArena in 2007. After failing to do <b>so,</b> <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> to move the team to Oklahoma City. Seattle sued Bennett's group to enforce the lease that required the team to stay until 2010. The two sides reached a $45million settlement to pay off the team's lease with KeyArena in July 2008.|$|E
5|$|At {{this stage}} Johnston {{was at the}} peak of his career in terms of bowling average and wickets taken per match. In his 24 Tests to the end of the series, he had taken 111 wickets at 19.22, with Australia winning 19 and losing two. In the Fourth Test in Melbourne, Johnston took match figures of 5/110, {{removing}} Weekes in both innings, before coming to the crease in the second innings to partner Doug Ring. Australia were 9/222 in pursuit of 260 for victory, with the series finely poised 2–1. The crowd of 30,000 and the constabulary were resigned to an Australian defeat, with the police officers moving into position to stop the customary pitch invasion at the end of the match. However, the Richmond teammates had other ideas and put together a last wicket partnership of 38, which sealed an Australian victory by one wicket. Ring thought that playing for a draw was impractical, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> to attack, while Johnston attempted to hold up his end with a series of defensive shots. The West Indian captain John Goddard placed his fielders halfway to the boundary, allowing Johnston to easily take singles, while Ring was able to clear the infield easily. The Richmond pair thought that Goddard's captaincy was poor. Johnston eventually brought up the winning run by turning Frank Worrell for a single behind square leg, 35 minutes after he came to the crease.|$|E
5|$|Bruce McLaren Motor Racing {{was founded}} in 1963; Bruce McLaren was a factory driver for the Cooper motor racing team which competed in Formula One, {{the highest level of}} {{international}} single-seater competition. For two years the McLaren team had raced in the Tasman Series, a competition for single-seaters that ran during the Formula One world championship off-season, and in various sports car races. Bruce McLaren continued to race in Grands Prix (i.e. Formula One championship races) for Cooper, but by 1965 the team's performances were worsening and <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> to build his own Formula One car to race the following year. Despite being a skilled engineer himself, McLaren enlisted Robin Herd to design the car. Herd was an aerospace engineer who had previously worked at the National Gas Turbine Establishment (NGTE) where he had been involved with the Concorde project. In September 1965 the M2A development car was completed. Powered by a 4.5 litre Oldsmobile V8 engine, it was used to test Herd's design ideas and Firestone's tyres. With McLaren still employed by Cooper, the McLaren team initially denied that they were building a Formula One competitor, claiming that the M2A was purely a tyre test bed.|$|E
