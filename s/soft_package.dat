40|$|In {{this work}} is {{reported}} an experimental and theoretical investigation on bandwidth enhancement of dielectric resonator antennas (DRA) using multiple DRAs, arranged according to the stacked configuration. Dielectric resonators antennas (DRAs) {{have been the subject}} of many investigations since they were introduced in 1982 by Long. Quite useful for high frequency applications, a dielectric resonator placed over a ground plane can serve as an effective radiator. Recent studies have demonstrated their potential for millimeter wave applications due to their several advantages over microstrip patch antennas such as high radiation efficiency, absence of surface waves and lower ohmic losses particularly at high frequencies. The antenna configuration consists of two cylindrical discs of different ceramic materials stacked vertically, one atop the other, placed above a ground plane, and excited by a coaxial probe. The lateral of the lower cylindrical DRA is placed against a coaxial probe, which excites the HEM 11 δ mode. The numerical procedure is performed through a <b>soft</b> <b>package</b> based on the finite element method. Excellent agreement between theoretical and experimental is obtained. It is verified the concept of increasing the bandwidth of the dielectric resonator antenna by stacking two DRAs...|$|E

Tumor cells as well as tumor-associated macrophages {{have been shown to}} secrete active forms of proteases and their inhibitors; however, their roles, especially those of proenzymes as markers of malignancy, are still under investigation. Aimto evaluate procathepsin B and endogenous inhibitors of cysteine proteases cystatins B and C in tumors of reproductive system. Materials and methodsSerum and ascites fluid of 38 patients with ovarian cancer (among them 15 patients after treatment) and benign ovarian tumors (n= 9), endometrial cancer (n= 31, before treatment 14), mammalian cancer (n= 29, before treatment 18) of stages II–IV for all groups, from Department of Gynecology of Regional Oncology Center, Novosibirsk, were under investigation. Serum of practically healthy women aged 18 – 80 (n= 82) from Regional Diagnostic Center, Novosibirsk, was used as a control group. Serum of women with tumors of the reproductive system and ascites fluids of women with ovarian tumors (aged 18 – 80 years), before operation were used for assay of procathepsin B, cysteine protease inhibitors cystatins B and C. Serum procathepsin B concentration was measured by ELISA commercial kit for human (R&D) USA; cystatin C using BioVendor commercial kits (Czechia), cystatin B – with help of ELISA kits for human (USCN Life Science Inc., Wuhan, China).

40|$|During {{the past}} four decades, Solid State Ionics (SSI) field has {{attracted}} numerous researchers and engineers to cultivate new technologies which plays important roles {{in the development of}} sustainable energy utilization and clean transportation tools. The commercialization of lithium ion battery, sodium sulfur battery, sodium chloride battery, solid oxygen sensors have illustrated the success of SSI's theories and technologies. The discovery and successful applications of ionic or mixed conductive materials, such as LiCoO 2 and LiFePO 4 as active materials of lithium ion battery cathode, Na-β/β'-Al 2 O 3 ceramics as solid electrolytes and separators for sodium based batteries, ZrO 2 as electrolytes for SOFC and oxygen sensors, and the newly developed Li 10 GeP 2 S 12 [1] and Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 [2] as lithium ion conductor, laid a solid foundation for the development of SSI technologies. Recently, rechargeable lithium metal anode based batteries have become hot research topics in the field of SSI due to their extremely high specific capacity suitable for future generation of power sources in portable electronic devices, electric vehicles and energy storage systems. Among all the Li anode based batteries, Li-S and Li-air battery systems are the two most attractive candidates because of the low cost and abundance of sulfur and air as cathode active materials, especially the characteristics of easy access of active O 2 from the surrounding air for Li-air batteries. Breakthroughs have been made recently with these batteries. SION Power's Li-S cells reached the highest practical specific energy as high as 350 Wh/kg, with a pack of 576 cells engineering the QinetiQ Zephyr Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) more than 336 h (14 d) of continuous flight, significantly surpassing the previous official record[3]. Their energy densities are higher than 500 Wh/kg for more than 500 cycles[3] and commercialization in the near future[4] are expected. Many Chinese institutions successfully prepared <b>soft</b> <b>package</b> lithium sulfur batteries[5]. The highest specific capacity of sulfur electrode over 900 mAh/g at 2 C rate was realized by the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Important advances in Li-air batteries were also made by designing carbon free air electrode [6, 7] and by the aid of LATP solid lithium electrolyte lately[8]. However, the development of the rechargeable high energy lithium metal batteries are still hindered by the high reactivity of lithium metal with liquid electrolytes and the occurrence of dendrite growth during charge and discharge cycles. Moreover, the cycling stability of the batteries are still far away from the standard of practical applications of electric vehicle and electronic devices. Owing to the intrinsic highly resistive feature of the cathode materials, sulfur and lithium containing resultants with oxygen, structural and compositional designs of the cathode, the protection of lithium metal anode, and the control of the electrode/electrolyte interface are urgent matter to develop practical rechargeable lithium batteries. SSI has been tackling the vital technical problems of high performance devices with solid ionic and mixed conductors as their key materials, which has great potential contribution to future energy and environmental needs of our society...|$|E
