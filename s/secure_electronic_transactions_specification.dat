Key technologies facilitating these capabilities were the Hypertext Transfer (HTTP) protocol, the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, and the Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (S/MIME) specification. This year we discuss utilizing the <b>Secure</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>Transaction</b> (SET) <b>specification</b> in tandem with HTTP, SSL, and S/MIME to deploy a system for securely selling telemetry data over the Internet...|$|R

These trust assumptions, whether implicit or explicit, affect {{the scope of the}} analysis, derivation of security requirements, and in some cases how functionality is realized. This paper presents trust assumptions in the context of analysis of security requirements. A running example shows how trust assumptions can be used by a requirements engineer to help define and limit the scope of analysis and to document the decisions made during the process. The paper concludes with a case study examining the impact of trust assumptions on software that uses the <b>Secure</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>Transaction</b> (SET) <b>specification.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a protocol design process, and illustrate its use by creating ATSPECT, an Authentication Test-based <b>Secure</b> Protocol for <b>Electronic</b> Commerce <b>Transactions.</b> The design process is {{organized around the}} authentication tests, a method for protocol verification based on the strand space theory.

ATSPECT offers functionality and security guarantees akin to the purchase request, payment authorization, and payment capture phases of SET, the <b>secure</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>transaction</b> standard created by the major credit card firms. In previous work [10, 12, 8], we have developed a method—called the “authentication test ” method—that {{can be used by}} hand to verify cryptographic protocols. We also pointed out that the same ideas can be used to guide the protocol development process, quickly leading to new protocols; proofs of correctness for these protocols then follow from the development process. In [10, 12] we illustrated the point by “reinventing ” preexisting protocols. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to use it to create a completely new protocol with highly non-trivial functionality. We call our new protocol ATSPECT, an Authentication Test-based <b>Secure</b> Protocol for <b>Electronic</b> Commerce <b>Transactions.</b> It is intended to achieve the essential security goals of the existing <b>Secure</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>Transaction</b> (SET) purchase request, payment authorization, and payment capture phases, as we understand them.

40|$|Credit cards {{have been}} the {{dominant}} payment method in e-commerce during the past years {{and it is not}} expected {{that this is going to}} change soon. However, credit card payments as used today are not suited for anonymous or pseudonymous payments. Credit card payments disclose the identity of a customer to the merchant and the issuer of the credit card knows exactly where the customer makes payments. The <b>Secure</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>Transaction</b> (SET) protocol makes credit card payments over the Internet more secure, but it does not much to protect the privacy of the customer. In this report, we present the Pseudonymous <b>Secure</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>Transaction</b> (PSET) protocol. PSET is an extension of SET and enables pseudonymous credit card payments over the Internet. Pseudonymous payments mean that none of the involved parties in the payment process can learn the identities of both the customer and the merchant at the same time. This is achieved by distributing the knowledge of the whole transaction among the involved parties. On the other hand, PSET guarantees that it is not possible for any of the involved parties to cheat and that it is possible to unambiguously resolve the identity of a pseudonymous customer in case of a dispute...|$|R
