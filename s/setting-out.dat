As I wanted to {{photograph}} the particular set-out for the purpose of illustrating this account, I took a larger share in the arrangement than I usually do. It was necessary to get everything into the picture, to ensure a light background that would throw up some of the trees, prevent too much overlapping, and things like that. When the photographing was over, matters became more normal. I left the schoolroom, and when I returned I found that the group of riflemen which had been converging on the publichouse had been sharply recalled to duty, and were trotting in a disciplined, cheerless way towards the railway station. The elephant had escaped from the zoo into the Blue Ward, and was being marched along by a military patrol. The originally scattered boy scouts were being paraded. G. P. W. had demolished the shop of the Jokil Company, and was building a Red End station near the bend. The stock of the Jokil Company had passed {{into the hands of the}} adjacent storekeepers. Then the town hall ceremonies came to an end and the guard marched off. Then G. P. W. demolished the rifle-range, and ran a small branch of the urban railway uphill to the town hall door, and on into the zoological gardens. This was only the beginning of a period of enterprise in transit, a small railway boom. A number of halts of simple construction sprang up. There was much making of railway tickets, of a size that enabled passengers to stick their heads through the middle and wear them as a Mexican does his blanket. Then a battery of artillery turned up in the High Street and there was talk of fortifications. Suppose wild Indians were to turn up across the plains to the left and attack the town!

And the next-following years did pass untroubled over the prosperous Family. But [...] "ill-luck," [...] as the proverb says, [...] "comes with a long stride." [...] In the Spring of 1796, when the French, under Jourdan and Moreau, had overrun South Germany, there reached Schiller, on a sudden, {{alarming}} tidings from Solitüde. In the Austrian chief Hospital, which had been established in the Castle there, an epidemic fever had broken out; and had visited the Schiller Family among others. The youngest Daughter Nanette had sunk under this pestilence, in the flower of her years; and whilst the second Daughter Luise lay like to die of the same, the Father also was laid bedrid with gout. For fear of infection, nobody except the Doctors would risk himself at Solitüde; and so the poor weakly Mother stood forsaken there, and had, for months long, to bear alone the whole burden of the household distress. Schiller felt it painfully that {{he was unable to}} help his loved ones, in so terrible a posture of affairs; and it cost him great effort to hide these feelings from his friends. In his pain and anxiety, he turned himself at last to his eldest Sister Christophine, Wife of Hofrath Reinwald in Meiningen; and persuaded her to go to Solitüde to comfort and support her people there. Had not the true Sister-heart at once acceded to her Brother's wishes, he had himself taken the firm determination to go in person to Swabia, in the middle of May, and bring his Family away from Solitüde, and make arrangements for their nursing and accommodation. The news of his Sister's <b>setting-out</b> relieved him of a great and continual anxiety. [...] "Heaven bless thee," [...] writes he to her on the 6th May, [...] "for this proof of thy filial love." [...] He earnestly entreats her to prevent his dear Parents from delaying, out of thrift, any wholesome means of improvement to their health; and declares himself ready, with joy, to bear all costs, those of travelling included: she is to draw on Cotta in Tübingen for whatever money she needs. Her Husband also he thanks, in a cordial Letter, for his consent to this journey of his Wife.|$|E

When survey and <b>setting-out</b> tasks should be performed in certain area, one can found in it allways some points of the fundamental and detail state controls. To use these points for some actual aims, it is necessary to investigate their compatibility (among the point mark positions and the point coordinate of control points). This can be done using GPS surveying that may be at the same time employed to determine the new point in the relevant area. Principle of quality investigatingf an existing control is founded on determination of point coordinates CJt from GPS measurements. Then, based on discrepancies among the "official" netpoint coordinates CJ and coordinates CJt "given by GPS", it can be estimated the degree and the real compatibility dislocations in the network structure of the existing points.

40|$|Outboard {{elements}} (arms, towers) {{are widely}} used in spacecraft structure for <b>setting-out</b> of a payload; their high stiffness-weight ratio provides an opportunity to decrease the mass. The deployment unit is considered {{as an example of}} outboard structure. Its strength beams work under special conditions in operation. At the transportation stage beams are under considerable vibration loads. Therefore for increasing the natural resonance frequency it is rational to increase their rigidity. Using the micro-arc oxide coating suggests itself because the modulus of elasticity of the micro-arc oxide coating is more than that of the aluminium alloy. The beams suffer considerable bending load at the step of deploying; therefore the aluminium alloy with the micro-arc oxide coating must have suitable loading capacity, in addition to increased rigidity. Influence of micro-arc oxide coating on the rigidity and strength of tubes f rom aluminium alloy is investigated. It is determined that forming the micro-arc oxide coating on thin-walled tubes with a ratio of the coating area to the cross-section area of more than 25 % is the most rational. In this case the rigidity of composite material considerably exceeds the rigidity of the aluminium alloy of the same cross-section while the redistribution of stresses in the surface coating of heterogeneous elasticity cross-section doesn’t cause the sudden increase of stresses. Also forming an attainable thickness of the micro-arc oxide coating on the surface of tube from aluminium alloy will be rational solution because the increase of attainable thickness of the microarc oxide coating provides an opportunity to form it on thick-walled tubes saving an acceptable, {{in the context of the}} strength, ratio of the coating area to the overall cross-section area. Micro-arc oxidation is an advanced method to form the wear resistant, resistant to corrosion, heat-shielding and electrically insulating coatings, but depending on the operating conditions, type of structures, and dominant type of deformations the choice of the micro-arc oxide coating thickness can have a considerable effect on the loading capacity of structure. </p...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper serves two purposes: (i) {{it can be}} used by {{students}} as an introduction to chapters 1 - 5 of book iii of the NE; (ii) it suggests an answer to the unresolved question what overall objective this section of the NE has. The paper focuses primarily on Aristotle’s theory of what makes us responsible for our actions and character. After some preliminary observations about praise, blame and responsibility (Section 2), it sets out in detail how all the key notions of NE iii 1 - 5 are interrelated (Sections 3 - 9). The <b>setting-out</b> of these interconnections makes it then possible to provide a comprehensive interpretation of the purpose of the passage. Its primary purpose is to explain how agents are responsible for their actions not just insofar as they are actions of this kind or that, but also insofar as they are noble or base: agents are responsible for their actions qua noble or base, because, typically via choice, their character dispositions are a causal factor of those actions (Section 10). The paper illustrates the different ways in which agents can be causes of their actions by means of Aristotle’s four basic types of agents (Section 11). A secondary purpose of NE iii 1 - 5 is to explain how agents can be held responsible for consequences of their actions (Section 12), in particular for their character dispositions insofar as these are noble or base, i. e. virtues or vices (Section 13). These two goals {{are not the only ones}} Aristotle pursues in the passage. But they are the ones Aristotle himself indicates in its first sentence and summarizes in its last paragraph; and the ones that give the passage a systematic unity. The paper also briefly consider the issues of freedom-to-do-otherwise, free choice and free-will in the contexts in which they occur (i. e. in the final paragraphs of Sections 6, 7, 12, 13) ...|$|E
40|$|The ambitious late Gothic vaults {{created in}} the 15 th and 16 th centuries with their complex shape and {{complicated}} meshes of ribs soaring along spatial curves, were extremely demanding in their geometric design. This regards both {{the design of the}} whole structure, as also the design specifications for the single stone elements which were prefabricated and fit together on the building site with astonishing precision. In consequence, the particular character of these structures and their geometric features are intrinsically linked to the design routines and the geometric concepts used by the Master Builders. At present, these procedures and methods are not well understood, because they are not documented in original drawings, and because they differ in principle from the modern practice. In consequence, necessary works of repairing and restoring cannot recur to any information related to the original design. Moreover, understanding the characteristics of information transfer from the design to the execution, would cast a light on the information society in which these constructions were created. In several case studies, the geometric concepts of the intricate spatial curve systems of late Gothic vaults have been clarified on the basis of detailed surveys and geometrical analyses carried out on the built objects. On this background, also the existing sources such as historical design treatises could be re-interpreted. In a collaboration between the research group working on the design principles of late Gothic vaults at the Technische Universität Dresden, and expert stone masons specialized on historical working techniques and practical stereotomy at the Cathedral Workshop Œuvre Notre-Dame de Strasbourg, the phases of the design process, such as full-scale drawings on the tracing floor and the production of full-scale models and samples of ribs and keystones, are currently investigated in practical experiments. As result, we propose a complete picture of the design process from the general concept to the <b>setting-out</b> of the single stone elements. Further, we are able to drive general considerations on the Late Medieval and Early Modern design practice for stone structures and trace a new interpretation of the early treatises of stereotomy...|$|E
40|$|Fire Rescue Service is {{the basic}} {{component}} of an integrated rescue system, with high working demands placed on their activity. The number of activities firefighter units perform is extensive; especially great {{attention is paid to}} interventions with eventual incidence of ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation is not possible to detect by human senses, but is possible to detect with special instruments. Identification of ionizing radiation is not simple; it requires certain amount of time, professional knowledge, and facilities. To prevent irradiation of people who are present at an intervention place and also people who intervene, the units of Fire Rescue Service of the Czech Republic are equipped with the portable ionizing radiation detectors according to Conception of Chemical Service. These are namely DC- 3 E- 98, DC- 3 H- 08 and Ultra- Radiac (U-RAD 115). The instruments are constructed to detect radiation. The goal of the thesis is to compare instruments in terms of the accuracy and speed of measurement and to assess suitability of use of the instruments by fire protection units of the Czech Republic, economic comparison and the practicability of the instruments. DC- 3 E- 98 is hand contamination detector used for surface contamination and dose rate meter that dates with its design back to 1970 s of the series DC- 3 used for operative radiological survey. It was developed and manufactured in today's nonexistent plant Zavod mechanizace a automatizace Ostrov nad Ohri. This device has been used until recent days after had been modified at the end of 1990 s and because of needs to follow Act on Metrology. It is consisting of two parts, separate instrument and removable probe. Both parts create easily demountable unit allowing carrying out measuring by only one hand. Its great advantage is fast response and large-area probe with Geiger-Müller tube used as a detector. DC- 3 H- 08 is the latest type coming out of type series DC- 3 and was developed by the innovation of previous type DC- 3 E- 98. This device was developed by the company VF a. s. Cerna Hora using financial sources coming from European Union for the Fire Rescue Service of the Czech Republic. It is the instrument with satisfactorily large display and robust construction suitable for measuring outdoors. It is consisting of two independent parts - indicator and basic units. When mounted together, the device works as complex, when separated, each unit can work independently and the communication between them is wireless using Bluetooth. The device is possible operate using four buttons at the indicator unit. It is possible to use the device for measuring kerma dose in the air, areal dose equivalent dosage, surface activity, accumulated dose and for checking people's contamination. The disadvantage of the device is its heavy weight and impossibility of controlling audio output, operating time (only 4 hours), and its high purchase price when compared to others. Ultra-Radiac (U-RAD 115) is hand detector determined for indication of gama radiation sources, measuring dose rates, scheduling the time for people who intervene, <b>setting-out</b> safety zone for gama radiation and for direct data reading of accumulated dose. The device is company Canbera Dover Inc. ' product. It is device of smaller size; its operation is actually easy and intuitive with the help of six buttons.

40|$|A {{dissertation}} {{presented to}} the Higher Degrees Committee of the Cape Peninsula University of Technology in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Technology: Construction Management, 2012 This study investigated {{the underlying causes of}} rework in construction projects and the impact on overall project performance so that effective containment and reduction strategies can be developed. The objectives of the study were as follows: (i) to determine the influence different project types have on the causes of rework in construction projects; (ii) to determine the impact of rework on organisational and project performance; (iii) to determine the influence various project types have on rework costs (direct and indirect) in construction projects; (iv) to determine the influence various procurement methods have on total rework costs in construction projects; (v) to design and develop rework reduction and containment strategies. The research was motivated by several international and local studies demonstrating a lack of concern for the root causes of rework and the potential impact on cost, overall project performance, and the ‘value-addedness’ to the completed project. The research approach adopted included an exploratory and main study targeting purposively selected construction professionals and stakeholders in the Cape Peninsula metropolitan area of the Western Cape Province. The exploratory case study was carried out at the initial stage of the study to gain more insight into the causes and impact of rework on overall project performance. Specifically, data was collected by means of observation of physical works, semi-structured interviews with relevant parties directly involved in site operation and the analysis of site instruction record documents. The main study obtained data from 78 construction professionals and stakeholders via questionnaire survey, a survey conducted among design consultants and contractors in the general building category ranging from grade 3 to 9 who are registered with Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB). Descriptive, inferential statistics and probability distribution functions were used to analyse the data. The findings revealed that changes initiated by the client, changes initiated by the design team due to errors and omissions, poor coordination, and finally, integration among the design team were the major contributing factors to rework. Moreover, non-compliance with specifications, <b>setting-out</b> errors, low labour skills, and emphasis on time and cost aggravated the occurrence of rework on site. The study revealed that while there is {{no significant difference between the}} causes of rework and various project types, rework can and often does make a significant contribution to any project’s cost overrun. The total mean cost of rework as a percentage of the original contract value for new build project and refurbishment/renovation projects was 4. 89 % and 6. 28 % respectively. However, rework costs do not differ relative to project type or procurement method. Furthermore, the study revealed that cost overruns, time overruns and design team dissatisfaction all impacted on project performance. The findings indicate that designrelated rework can be minimised by implementing the following strategies: team building, involvement of subcontractors and suppliers, and design for construction. Moreover, involvement of subcontractors during construction, and the implementation of quality control and site quality management systems could also lead to reduction in rework during the construction phase. Furthermore, the probabilistic analysis of rework occurrence was determined in the projects selected; this analysis predicts the occurrence of rework so that a quantitative risk assessment could be undertaken prior to the commencement of construction. The research concludes by recommending that design and construction firms must develop organisational measurement systems for recording rework occurrence and its associated costs. It is by determining the frequency and costs of rework that effective strategies for its containment and reduction can be identified...|$|E
