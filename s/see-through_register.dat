The Chiremba Balancing Rocks was to be reinstated as the main feature on the obverse whilst use of the Zimbabwe Bird watermark continued. There were additional security features as opposed to previous issues, which included security threads, <b>see-through</b> <b>register</b> marks and recognition marks for the partially sighted. Holographic security threads and Optically Variable Ink were used on the $100, $500 and $1000 notes. When the redenomination of 1 August 2008 occurred these notes were put into circulation as banknotes of the third dollar between 1 August 2008 to 31 December 2008.|$|E

50|$|The current £50 {{note was}} {{introduced}} in 2011. It features two portraits on the reverse: engineer and scientist James Watt and industrialist and entrepreneur Matthew Boulton, along with the Whitbread Engine and the Soho Manufactory, Birmingham. The note {{has a number of}} security features in addition to the metallic thread, including motion thread, raised print, a watermark, microlettering, a <b>see-through</b> <b>register,</b> and a colourful pattern that only appears under ultraviolet light. The current note is the first Bank of England banknote to feature two people on the reverse, and the first Bank of England note to feature the motion thread security feature. This is an image in a broken green thread that moves as the note is viewed from different angles.|$|E
5000|$|The current £20 {{note was}} {{introduced}} in 2007. It features a portrait of Scottish economist Adam Smith on the back {{as well as an}} illustration of workers in a pin factory. The note features a number of security features in addition to the metallic thread: these include raised print, a watermark, microlettering, a holographic strip, a <b>see-through</b> <b>register,</b> and a colourful pattern which only appears under ultraviolet light. In September 2015 the Bank of England announced that the next £20 note will be printed on polymer, rather than cotton paper. This was followed by an announcement in April 2016 that Adam Smith will be replaced by artist J. M. W. Turner on the next £20 note, which will enter circulation by 2020. Images on the reverse of the Turner note will include a 1799 self-portrait of Turner, a version of Turner's The Fighting Temeraire, the quote [...] "Light is therefore colour" [...] from an 1818 lecture by Turner, and a copy of Turner's signature as made on his will.|$|E
