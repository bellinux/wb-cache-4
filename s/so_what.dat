5|$|So Far, So Good... <b>So</b> <b>What!</b> (stylized as so far, so good... <b>so</b> <b>what</b> !) is {{the third}} studio album by the American thrash metal band Megadeth, {{released}} on January 19, 1988 by Capitol Records. It is the band's only album recorded with drummer Chuck Behler and guitarist Jeff Young, {{both of whom were}} fired immediately after its subsequent tour. So Far, So Good... <b>So</b> <b>What!</b> features music performed at very fast tempos with technical ability; lyrically, frontman and guitarist Dave Mustaine addresses a variety of topics, including nuclear holocaust and freedom of speech.|$|E
5|$|So Beautiful or <b>So</b> <b>What</b> is {{the twelfth}} solo studio album by American folk rock singer-songwriter Paul Simon. For the album, he reunited with former {{collaborator}} and record producer Phil Ramone. Having experimented with rhythm-based textures {{for much of}} the previous two decades, Simon returned to composing songs rather traditionally using only his acoustic guitar. These songs were further augmented by experimental recording practices in the studio. The album was largely recorded in a small cottage at Simon's home in New Canaan, Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} are {{a sample of}} the basic or widely practiced throws and pins. Many of these techniques derive from Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu, but some others were invented by Morihei Ueshiba.

Note that despite the names of the first five techniques listed, they are not universally taught in numeric order.|$|E

5|$|The {{music of}} So Beautiful or <b>So</b> <b>What</b> {{features}} West African blues-inspired guitar playing, Indian-style percussion, and experimentation with samples, which ranged from {{an excerpt from}} a 1941 sermon to nighttime ambience in Kenya. The songs were recorded with little bass but with a very large presence of bells. Much of Simon's lyrics touch on themes of spirituality and mortality, which Simon said was unintentional and resulted naturally in his songwriting process for the album.|$|E
5|$|When So Beautiful or <b>So</b> <b>What</b> was {{released}} by Hear Music on April 8, 2011, it received widespread acclaim from critics, many of whom considered it Simon's best work in two decades. It appeared on many year-end critics' lists {{as one of the}} year's best records. The album also became his highest US chart debut, reaching number four on the Billbooard 200, and charted within the top ten in nine other countries.|$|E
5|$|When So Beautiful or <b>So</b> <b>What</b> was {{released}} in the United States, it debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 and sold 68,000 copies in its first week. It was Simon's highest chart debut on the Billboard 200, and by October 2011, it had sold 254,000 copies in the US. It has sold 319,000 copies in the US as of April 2016. In the United Kingdom, the album debuted at number six on the British albums chart, selling 21,993 copies in its first week. It was Simon's ninth top-ten solo album in the UK.|$|E

5|$|After Cassini {{became the}} first {{director}} of the Paris Observatory in 1671, he tackled {{the problem of the}} physical scale of the Solar System. The relative size of the planetary orbits was known from Kepler's third law, <b>so</b> <b>what</b> was needed was the actual size of one of the planet's orbits. For this purpose, the position of Mars was measured against the background stars from different points on the Earth, thereby measuring the diurnal parallax of the planet. During this year, the planet was moving past the point along its orbit where it was nearest to the Sun (a perihelic opposition), which made this a particularly close approach to the Earth. Cassini and Jean Picard determined the position of Mars from Paris, while the French astronomer Jean Richer made measurements from Cayenne, South America. Although these observations were hampered by the quality of the instruments, the parallax computed by Cassini came within 10% of the correct value. The English astronomer John Flamsteed made comparable measurement attempts and had similar results.|$|E
5|$|Central to this discussion, it was {{announced}} in 2009, that the radius of Betelgeuse had shrunk from 1993 to 2009 by 15%, with the 2008 angular measurement equal to 47.0mas, {{not too far from}} Perrin's estimate. Unlike most earlier papers, this study encompassed a 15-year period at one specific wavelength. Earlier studies have typically lasted one to two years by comparison and have explored multiple wavelengths, often yielding vastly different results. The diminution in Betelgeuse's apparent size equates to a range of values between 56.0±0.1mas seen in 1993 to 47.0±0.1mas seen in 2008—a contraction of almost 0.9AU in 15years. What is not fully known is whether this observation is evidence of a rhythmic expansion and contraction of the star's photosphere as astronomers have theorized, and if <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> the periodic cycle might be, although Townes suggested that if a cycle does exist, it is probably a few decades long. Other possible explanations are photospheric protrusions due to convection or a star that is not spherical but asymmetric causing the appearance of expansion and contraction as the star rotates on its axis.|$|E
5|$|The chronicle {{continues}} {{by stating}} that Óláfr then {{took control of the}} fleet whereupon he led it to Mann, where he and Guðrøðr divided the kingdom between themselves—with Óláfr retaining Mann, and Guðrøðr controlling the Hebridean portions; in fact, it is possible that Hákon may have originally intended for Óláfr and Guðrøðr to split the kingdom of Mann and the Isles between themselves. According to the saga the Norwegians left in the spring, sailing north to Kintyre where they encountered and battled a strong force of Scots with both sides losing many men during the ensuing battle. The saga then recounts how the fleet sailed north to Lewis and displaced a certain Þórmóðr Þórkelson, before travelling to Orkney, from where most of the fleet sailed back to Norway. Páll, however, is stated to have remained behind, and to have been slain by Guðrøðr several weeks later. The saga notes that Guðrøðr was also slain in the Isles a short time after this. The Chronicle of Mann specifically places Guðrøðr's death on Lewis, although it does not cast any light upon the circumstances. Even <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> is certain is that it was only after Guðrøðr's death that Óláfr's kingship was safe from any rival claim.|$|E
