40|$|A {{population}} of 379 Dutch workers exposed to organic solvents was {{compared with a}} non-exposed {{population of}} 443 workers {{with regard to the}} prevalence of prenarcotic and neuraesthenic symptoms. Participants completed a questionnaire to collect information about their occupational history, exposure to organic solvents, and the occurrence of symptoms. The results of the study indicated that workers exposed to solvents have a higher reporting rate of prenarcotic symptoms than workers not exposed to solvents. The prevalence of chronic neurotoxic effects, however, in the form of neuraesthenic symptoms was only weakly associated with reported exposure to organic solvents. The influence of work stress in the development of these symptoms is perhaps more important than the role of exposure to organic solvents. It is concluded that the organic <b>solvent</b> <b>syndrome</b> type I, as defined by an international workshop, is not an important health hazard among Dutch painters...|$|E
40|$|Toluene {{has been}} {{reported}} to antagonize the function of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. In this study, the effects of neonatal toluene exposure on NMDA receptors in primarily cultured cerebellar granule neurons were examined. Spargue-Dawley rats were treated with toluene (0, 200, 500, and 1000 mg/ kg, i. p.) from postnatal day (PN) 4 to PN 7. Under toluene-free conditions, Ca 2 + signals of cultured neurons in response to glutamate and NMDA were measured for up to 14 days. The expression of NMDA receptor subunits (NR 1, NR 2 A, and NR 2 B) at 5 – 14 days in vitro (DIV) were also determined. Neonatal toluene exposure dose-dependently reduced intracellular Ca 2 + signals in response to glutamate/glycine and NMDA/glycine in cultured cerebellar granule neurons, and these effects were gradually decreased with time. Such toluene exposure did not influence the inhibition of Mg 2 + or MK 801 on NMDA-evoked responses, but it decreased the potency of ifenprodil (an NR 2 B preferring antagonist). The protein levels of NMDA receptor subunit NR 2 B were consistently reduced by toluene exposure at 5 DIV, but not at 14 DIV. These results demonstrate that neonatal toluene exposure induces long-term but reversible changes in the function and composition of NMDA receptors. Such changes during developmental stages may contribute to the cerebellar dysfunction observed in fetal <b>solvent</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Key Words: toluene; neonatal; NMDA receptor; Ca 2 þ; NR 2 B; cerebellar granule neurons...|$|E
5000|$|Chronic solvent induced {{encephalopathy}} (CSE) is {{a condition}} induced by long-term exposure to organic solvents, often but not always in the workplace, that lead {{to a wide variety}} of persisting sensorimotor polyneuropathies and neurobehavioral deficits even after solvent exposure has been removed. This syndrome can also be referred to as [...] "psycho-organic syndrome", [...] "organic solvent syndrome", [...] "chronic painter's syndrome", [...] "occupational solvent encephalopathy", [...] "solvent intoxication", [...] "toxic solvent syndrome", [...] "painters disease", [...] "psycho-organic syndrome", [...] "chronic toxic encephalopathy", and [...] "neurasthenic syndrome". The multiple names of <b>solvent</b> induced <b>syndromes</b> combined with inconsistency in research methods makes referencing this disease difficult and its catalog of symptoms vague.|$|R
40|$|Epidemiological {{studies have}} {{provided}} evidence that neuropsychiatric symptoms are induced by long term exposure to solvents; individual diagnosis with psychometric tests, however, {{is not always}} possible (for example, when the patient has linguistic difficulties). Therefore evoked potentials and cerebral blood flow were studied in 50 patients occupationally exposed to solvents who were referred to our department and for whom a <b>solvent</b> induced psycho-organic <b>syndrome</b> was suspected. Degree of exposure was evaluated by its duration (mean 13. 9, range 1 to 37 years) and its intensity (from an interview). At the group level, P 22 and N 35 latencies and amplitude N 20 -P 22 of somatosensory evoked potentials were higher in cases than in controls (p < 0. 05), whereas {{there was no difference}} for brainstem and visual evoked potentials, nor for hemispheric cerebral blood flow (but a higher distribution in the left occipital region was seen in patients, p < 0. 05). Some parameters were linked to degree of exposure (amplitude N 20 -P 22 of somatosensory evoked potentials, interpeak latency I-V of brainstem evoked potentials, distribution of cerebral blood flow in the internal frontal left region). At the individual level, these examinations were not of diagnostic value because sensitivity was low...|$|R
40|$|A {{case history}} of the {{induction}} of asthma and chemical sensitivity in a 42 -year-old registered nurse illustrates several of the characteristic features of multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS). This patient's problems started shortly after moving into a new home under construction, with associated chemical exposures. Other MCS patients report {{the onset of the}} condition with other chemical exposures such as those encountered at their places of work or use of pesticides at their residences. Patients often describe a spreading phenomenon of increasing intolerance to commonly encountered chemicals at concentrations well tolerated by other people. Symptoms usually wax and wane with exposures, {{and are more likely to}} occur in patients or families with preexisting histories of migraine or with classical allergies. Idiosyncratic medication reactions (especially to preservative chemicals) are common in MCS patients, as are dysautonomia symptoms (such as vascular instability) and poor temperature regulation. Myalgia and joint pains and food intolerance are common features as well. Contamination with xenobiotic chemicals is frequently found in these patients when they are tested. Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome is a recently identified condition that exhibits features of both asthma and chemical sensitivity. MCS patients frequently have patterns of neurotoxic brain metabolism that can be confirmed on single photo emission computed tomography imaging.

40|$|Abstract. Toluene {{is a major}} {{component}} of numerous commercial organic solvent formulations. It is often listed among the chemicals capable of producing the organic <b>solvent</b> <b>syndrome</b> and a neurobehavioral hypersensitivity condition. The hyper-sensitivity condition (continued long-term intensification of some behavioral reactions in response to pharmacological or environmental stressors) is usually associated with the increased tonus of the functional dopaminergic system. The aim of our current research was to determine whether, under conditions of inhalation exposure, toluene can produce long-term behav-ioral changes or modify the intensity of the behavioral response to apomorphine, a dopaminergic receptor agonist. In our experiment, male rats were exposed to 25, 100 and 250 ppm toluene for 4 weeks (5 days/week, 6 h/day). The following behav-iors were tested: finding water in a radial maze; open field motor activity; acquiring the conditional response of passive avoid-ance; sensitivity to a thermal pain stimulus (hot plate test) and changes in this sensitivity caused by stress; and acquiring the conditional response of two-directional active avoidance. The behavioral response to apomorphine, i. e. the increased spon-taneous locomotor activity, was assessed on day 10 after the termination of the exposure in the rotary drum test. In the behavioral experiment, significant differences between groups were recorded only for the hot plate test; in the 100 and 250 ppm rats, electric-shock-related anxiety response was stronger than in the control group. In the experiment using pharmacological provocation, the behavioral response to apomorphine in the rats exposed to 100 ppm or 250 ppm toluene was significantly lower. Our results indicate that low concentrations of toluene may produce long-term behavioral change...|$|E
