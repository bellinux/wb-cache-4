The resulting finely divided wet powdered rubber particles were separated by filtration and then converted to free-flowing powders by oven drying. The level of encapsulation {{as well as the}} properties of the resulting powder was highly dependent on the strength and the amount of the <b>Starch</b> <b>Xanthate</b> (SX) solution. The lower and the upper limits of Degree of Substitution (DS) of SX examined were 0. 07 and 0. 35 and the results suggested that the intermediate DS levels were more effective.

40|$|A {{cross-linked}} <b>starch</b> <b>xanthate</b> {{was prepared}} by graft copolymerization of acrylamide and sodium acrylate onto <b>starch</b> <b>xanthate</b> using potassium persulfate and {{sodium hydrogen sulfite}} initiating system and N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide as a cross-linker. As this kind of cross-linked potato <b>starch</b> <b>xanthate</b> can effectively absorb heavy metal ions, it was dispersed in aqueous solutions of divalent heavy metal ions (Pb 2 + and Cd 2 +) to investigate their absorbency by the polymer. Factors that can influence absorbency were investigated, such as the ratio of matrix to monomers, the amount of initiator and cross-linker, pH, and the concentration of metal ions. Results were reached and conclusion was drawn that the best synthetic conditions for the polymer adsorbing Pb 2 + and Cd 2 + were as follows: the quality ratio of matrix to monomers was 1 [*]:[*] 12 and 1 [*]:[*] 11, the amount of initiator was 2. 4 % and 3. 2 % of matrix, {{and the amount of}} cross-linker was 12 [*]mg and 13 [*]mg. When the initial concentration of ions was 10 [*]mg/L, the highest quantities of adsorption of Pb 2 + and Cd 2 + were 47. 11 [*]mg/g and 36. 55 [*]mg/g. Adsorption mechanism was discussed by using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS) test, and adsorption kinetic simulation...|$|E

In the meantime, {{the emergence of the}} viscose process and the rayon and cellulose film industries has stimulated a great amount of research on cellulose xanthates all over the world but, nevertheless, little knowledge has been gained about the distribution of the xanthate groups in the cellulose macro-molecule, and particularly within the anhydroglucose units.

40|$|Xanthate esters of {{cellulose}} {{have great importance}} for the cellophane and viscose rayon industries. Routine chemical analyses tell nothing {{of the way the}} xanthate groups are distributed along the cellulose molecule, or among the three different kinds of hydroxyl groups in the glucose residues. Information of this kind is needed before the process of "ripening" of viscose can be understood in detail, or the physical properties of rayon or cellophane correlated with those of the viscose from which they are derived. Owing to the instability {{of cellulose}} sodium xanthate, most of the chemical methods of carbohydrate chemistry are inadmissible. Hence the sodium xanthate is converted to a more stable ester. If then all the remaining free hydroxyl groups are "blocked" and xanthate ester groups are subsequently removed, the regenerated hydroxyl groups are attached to carbon atoms Which were previously substituted with xanthate groups. Attempts by numerous workers to remove all of the xanthate sulfur from fully substituted <b>starch</b> or cellulose <b>xanthate</b> esters consistently failed to remove a small percentage. Moreover, dexanthation was invariably accompanied by removal of {{a small percentage of the}} other "blocking" substituents. [ [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|We {{conducted}} {{a series of}} preliminary feeding trials with Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus), roof rats (/?. rattus), and Polynesian rats (R. exulans) {{to examine the effects of}} carbon disulfide (CS 2) on consumption of nontoxic foods. We formulated CS 2 at target concentrations of 10 ppm in deionized water, and of 50 ppm to 100, 000 ppm in a <b>starch</b> <b>xanthate</b> matrix. However, we did not analyze actual concentrations of CS 2 in the test foods or measure its rate of volatilization, and thus cannot verify the levels of CSj the rats were exposed to. CS 2 diluted in water and applied directly to food had no apparent effect on consumption by any of the species. Formulations with 50 ppm CS 2 in <b>starch</b> <b>xanthate</b> influenced food choice by Norway rats and roof rats in one test, but not in another. Concentrations ^ 10, 000 ppm repelled Norway rats. CS 2 -starch xanthate had little effect on consumption by Polynesian rats. Further testing is needed to develop effective formulations and delivery methods for utilizing CS 2 as a bait additive...|$|E

40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} {{research on the}} flocculation of various minerals with insoluble cross-linked <b>starch</b> <b>xanthate</b> (ISX) to determine its potential as a beneficiation technique for low-grade, highly dissem-inated ores and for selective desliming. Covellite, chalcocite, pyrite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, bornite, sphalerite, galena, and molybdenite fines flocculate with ISX. Floc formation, floc size, and settling rate are dependent on pH, with the pH dependence differing for each mineral. Quartz is not flocculated by ISX. Experiments to obtain selective flocculation of sulfides from quartz were attempted. Good selectivity was only obtained for the bornite-quartz system. postflocculation separations resulted in flocculated bornite in grades as high as 92 pet. Evidence is presented that the flocculation {{of many of the}} sulfide minerals with ISX may involve covalent bonding of the xanthate group to lattice metal site(s) ...|$|E
40|$|Glycerol and {{insoluble}} starch xanthates were synthesised {{and effectively}} {{used in the}} removal of Pb, Cd and Cu from aqueous solutions. The insoluble metal complex formed between the sulphur atoms in the xanthates and the heavy metals were easily separated. Lower dosage of glycerol xanthate was required in each case, with the optimum molar ratio (M 2 +/GX) of 2. Moreover, the use of glycerol xanthate required no pH adjustments to give a 100 % heavy metal removal {{within the range of}} the detection limit. As for the ISX, there was a remarkable metal scavenging activity when the ISX contained high amount of Sulphur per molecule (10. 12 % S) and when the pH was adjusted to 6. Butyl xanthate was also synthesised to make a good comparison with the glycerol and insoluble <b>starch</b> <b>xanthate.</b> The xanthates from these two sustainable materials (Starch and glycerol) are proven to be more effective in metal scavenging activity. FTIR and CHNS elemental analyses were used to prove the evidence of xanthation, in addition, 13 C NMR was used to characterise the glycerol xanthate...|$|E
30|$|The {{suspended}} soil (SS) in {{runoff from}} soils treated/untreated with PAM and BP were determined. No difference in SS {{was found between}} PAM and BP (P > 0.05). Average SS values from the soils treated with PAM and BP were decreased by 96.0 % compared to the CK (P < 0.05). We found that both applications of PAM and BP similarly increased soil stability and shear strength by clay flocculation between soil particles and molecules of these treatments. We suggest {{that the use of}} BP can be an environmentally friendly alternative to PAM that has extensively researched as a soil amendment (Theng 1982; Wallace and Wallace 1996; Zhang et al. 1998; 2006; Tang et al. 2006). Orts et al. (2000) showed that the BP suspension made from microfibrils of cellulose, <b>starch</b> <b>xanthate,</b> chitosan, and acid-hydrolyzed cellulose microfibril, reduced soil sediment by an average of 80 % compared to the CK. Application of the BP treatment should be practically used to not only reduce raindrop impacts such as soil-surface seal formation, soil detachment, and degradation of water quality, but also reproduce industrial wastes (Levin et al. 1991; Orts et al. 199920002007; Lee et al. 2008; Liu et al. 2008).|$|E
40|$|The {{agricultural}} use of polyacrylamide, PAM, as an additive in irrigation water has grown rapidly since commercial introduction in 1995, with over l million acres treated in 1998. PAM provides {{both economic and}} environmental benefits by improving water infiltration and reducing up to 98 % of erosion-induced soil losses — a yearly saving of tons of topsoil per acre. With as little as 5 ppm of PAM in the first irrigation water to run across the field, soil cohesion increases enough to prevent particle detachment and erosion. Stable soil/polymer flocs result from PAM's high molecular weight (typically> 12 million) and its affinity to soil via coulombic and Van der Waals attraction. Although water soluble linear PAM is the only class of commercial polymer presently used to reduce erosion during irrigation, other polymer additives have shown some potential. Biopolymers such as chitosan, <b>starch</b> <b>xanthate,</b> cellulose xanthate, and acid-hydrolyzed cellulose microfibrils reduce shear-induced erosion; however concentrations at least 6 - 10 times higher than PAM are required to obtain the> 90 % runoff sediment reduction shown by commercial PAM. The application of PAM in agricultural irrigation water and potential biopolymer alternatives to PAM are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Several {{existing}} {{technologies are}} available to treat metal bearing wastewaters. The simplest, is conventional alkaline precipitation using caustic or lime. This process is inhibited {{by the presence of}} some complexing agents, which keep the metal salts in solution. Processes to precipitate metals in the presence of complexing agents such as insoluble <b>starch</b> <b>xanthate</b> (ISX), ferrous sulfate, cellulose xanthate, hydrogen peroxide, sodium hydrosulfite, and sodium borohydride have been developed. All of these processes use expensive chemical precipitants, which convert the metal to a sludge, requiring dewatering and discarding. We now have developed a process employing ion exchange resins to remove heavy metals from wastewaters in the presence of complexers or chelators (US. Patent No. 4, 303, 704). The process has the simplicity, convenience, and the low cost enjoyed by the water softening processes, and we expect it to receive wide acceptance in the plating and surface finishing fields. This development has been delayed because these specialty resins have only recently been available fpr industrial use. It seemed to reason that a resin with chelating groups would prefer heavy metals to sodium or a chelator. This resin could take a metal away from its complexer if the complexer’s chelating or stability constants are less than the chelating constant of the functional group of the resin. This led us to prepare resins by reacting polyethyleneimines with chloracetic acid and cross-link the “comblike ” polymer, which structurally resembles the powerful chelator EDTA. -N-CH:CH?-N- t CICH:COONa- N-CHXH 2 -...|$|E
40|$|Rubber as a {{free-flowing}} powder, {{is essential}} in order to stream line the manufacturing processes of rubber goods. The previous works noted the importance of using powdered rubber as a competitive raw material for continuous processing in rubber industry. However, {{in most of these}} works, the study was continued to the synthetic rubbers and only a few had been reported on the natural rubber. Sri Lanka which is an agricultural based country, has a bulk quantity of natural rubber field latex at a low price. Hence, it is worthwhile to produce a value-added product like powdered rubber using field latex. Encapsulation is a common process in preparing powdered natural rubber. In this process, <b>starch</b> <b>xanthate,</b> SX, which acts as a diluent/reinforcing filler, behaves as an encapsulating agent for latex particles. The level of encapsulation as well as the properties of the resulting powder is highly dependent on the strength and the amount of the SX solution. The present work investigates these effects with varying strength of SX by changing the degrees of substitution, DS, of the SX solution and also the loading of the SX. The lower and the upper limits of DS of SX examined were 0. 07 and 0. 35 and the results suggested that the intermediate DS levels were more promising. The physical properties of the final vulcanizates were found to be satisfactory and were comparable with the rubbers available in the market. Study on drying techniques established the necessity of water washing step for natural rubber powders to remove non-rubber substances and the applicltion of an anti-cake agent to prevent agglomeration during drying. The effect of different anti-cake agents such as zinc stearate, talc powder and whiting was examined and zinc stearate was found to be the best out of the anti-cake agents used. Highly friable crumbs that ground readily to give powders were obtained with oven drying rather than with sun drying...|$|E
