50|$|For the season, the Heat {{changed their}} logo and uniforms. The uniforms lasted until 2009 where they <b>switched</b> the <b>logo</b> {{to the other}} leg of the shorts, while the primary logo is still present as of 2017.|$|R
5000|$|... 1917 - Black & Decker {{invented the}} {{familiar}} portable electric drill, obtaining a patent for a hand-held drill combining a pistol grip and trigger <b>switch.</b> Its <b>logo,</b> a hexagon, {{was used in}} one form or another from 1912 to 2014; it represents a hexagonal nut, a universal fastener.|$|R
50|$|In 1986, Reebok <b>switched</b> its <b>logo</b> {{from the}} Union Jack flag it had since its founding, to the vector logo with an {{abstract}} Union Jack streak across a race track. The switch signaled {{the transition of}} the company into a performance brand as it began licensing deals with professional athletes in the NBA and NFL.|$|R
5000|$|WKQC {{also claims}} to be Charlotte's first {{eco-friendly}} station that boasts a promotions fleet of gas saving and flex fuel vehicles. To further promote this, WKQC <b>switched</b> their <b>logo</b> to [...] "Be Cool, Go Green" [...] and promotes a 'green' lifestyle by providing tips and partnering with local community campaigns in the Charlotte area.|$|R
5000|$|On 13 April 2016, One <b>switched</b> from Supertext <b>logo</b> to Network Ten's Closed Captioning logo, when Ten {{discontinued}} the [...] "CC" [...] symbol {{since the}} mid-2000s.|$|R
25|$|In August 2014, {{the logo}} {{displayed}} for Greggs on its Google profile was mistakenly temporarily <b>switched</b> to the <b>logo</b> used on Uncyclopedia's {{article on the}} subject at the Wikia site due to a caching issue, causing a PR crisis for the company.|$|R
50|$|On July 25, 2011, after {{a weekend}} of stunting, WZJZ flipped to Top 40 (CHR), using the moniker Y100 {{even though there is}} no Y in the call letters. The station's format and logo is {{patterned}} after its sister station in nearby Miami, WHYI, but is customized for Southwest Floridians. The flip to Top 40 gave iHeartMedia two Top 40 stations in the Fort Myers market, along with rhythmic contemporary WBTT. In 2013, Y100 once again <b>switched</b> its <b>logo</b> to match WHYI, but with some slight differences.|$|R
50|$|For {{its first}} {{ten years in}} existence, the channel used a logo with a globe and an {{elephant}} which was also used by its sister channels. On 1 October 2008 the channel <b>switched</b> a new <b>logo,</b> which had previously been adopted by Animal Planet in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|The Ravens {{were forced}} to <b>switch</b> their helmet <b>logo</b> for the 1999 season. Security guard Frederick Bouchat contended that he had created the Ravens' logo—a [...] "B" [...] inside a winged shield—that had been used from 1996 to 1998. Bouchat sued the team for $10 million, and a judge upheld a jury's verdict {{supporting}} the claim.|$|R
50|$|The {{advent of}} {{television}} in the 1950s also {{opened the door to}} cel animation in production logos. Most studios had used cels for their animation departments' logos for some time by this point, but the demand for animation on TV, both as programming and for advertising, made more effects available for less money. TV itself started using logos on its programming: Desilu, Mark VII Productions and Revue Studios all had distinctive logotypes {{by the end of the}} decade, and Desilu's and Revue's were animated. By 1976, all of the major studios except Universal had <b>switched</b> their <b>logos</b> over to cel animation, and logos for smaller concerns and broadcasters were beginning to enter the computer age, using machines like Scanimate.|$|R
50|$|Python {{opened on}} July 1, 1976, {{as the first}} roller coaster at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay. It was repainted in 2003, the trains were also painted with the park's current <b>logo,</b> <b>switched</b> from the classic Python logo. Python {{permanently}} closed on October 31, 2006, and demolished for scrap shortly after in November 2006. The removal of Python was necessary {{to make way for}} the park's Jungala attraction, and was part of the largest renovation in Busch Gardens' history. Along with Python, the area's Tiger's Den gift shop, and Python Soft Serve have been torn down as a part of the Congo renovation.|$|R
50|$|The current {{version of}} the logo was {{introduced}} in 1999, removing the searchlights completely and <b>switching</b> the <b>logo</b> exclusively to a wordmark design. Despite this, the searchlight theme remains {{an integral part of}} 21st Century Fox's branding efforts; they are still incorporated into Fox News Channel's logo, and the universal station logo introduced in 2006 by Fox's owned-and-operated stations - which were retained by the seven former O&Os that Fox Television Stations sold in 2008 to Local TV and had spread to several Fox stations owned by Tribune Broadcasting (including those it acquired through the company's 2013 merger with Local TV; the logo introduced by the O&Os was modified for Tribune's Fox affiliates in 2012 to feature only one searchlight as part of the company's graphical standardizations for those stations) and certain other Fox affiliates not owned or operated by either company. The 1996-99 searchlight logo is still used within the logos of a small number of Fox affiliates; the searchlights continued to be featured in the logo of sister channel FX until a rebranding effort in 2008.|$|R
5000|$|Early in {{his career}} with King's X, Tabor's guitar sound was {{considered}} one of the most sought-after in rock. He played an unusual model of Fender Stratocaster called the [...] "Elite", a short-lived guitar with an on-board active mid-boost circuit that was only in production in the U.S.A. in 1983 and 1984. The remainder of his gear was more of a mystery; he would <b>switch</b> the <b>logos</b> on his amplifiers to keep his tone a secret. He later abandoned this clandestine approach, and revealed in an interview in the May 1996 issue of Guitar Player magazine that he had used a solid-state Gibson Lab Series L5 amplifier along with the Strat Elite guitar to record the first four King's X albums. By the time of the interview, however, he had changed his equipment completely, the main pieces of his gear being a rack-mounted Mesa/Boogie Dual Rectifier and the preamp of his Elite Stratocaster that was converted into a rack-mounted preamp (this allowed him to emulate the sound of his Elite Stratocaster, regardless of what guitar he used), which was his setup during the Dogman era, and would continue into the 1990s and early 2000s.|$|R
5000|$|The {{electricity}} {{was shut}} off {{just after midnight}} on Tuesday, 22 January 2002, {{in the middle of}} the [...] "Nightingale's Night" [...] show hosted by Vladimir Solovyov while guest performer Mikhail Krug was singing folk ballads. At 12:02 am, the program stopped with Solovyov announcing the shutdown of TV-6 and bidding farewell before the channel <b>switched</b> to TV-6's <b>logo</b> on a white background with an isometric thing on the left. At 12:09 am the channel switched to the Soviet-era UEIT testcard before they at 12:13 am switched to a message which said [...] "НАС СНЯЛИ С ЭФИРА" [...] ("We were taken off the air") on the black background. Within hours of TV-6's closure, the station's frequency was allotted to an all-sports station which aired a live coverage of the 2002 Winter Olympics.|$|R
50|$|In her new position, Nelson {{added a new}} {{assessment}} for books called a signature review. She permitted greater variety in the length of reviews (typically 200 to 500 words long), considered bylines to reviews, and changes to the magazine's cover format. She hired graphic designer Jean-Claude Suares, added color using so-called drop down shadows behind color book covers, and wrote an editorial each week. She <b>switched</b> the magazine's <b>logo</b> to use the two letters PW since the abbreviation was well understood within the publishing world. She developed a nominating board of several thousand booksellers and librarians to nominate books for prizes in nineteen different categories; readers voted for books within stores or online, and the awards were termed the Quill awards. There was increased use of a foldout advertisement on the front cover, with the theme repeated inside the table of contents page.|$|R
50|$|It {{seemed very}} likely that KPWB would become The CW's Des Moines {{affiliate}}, as NBC affiliate WHO-TV (channel 13) had a secondary affiliation with UPN. On March 16, 2006, Pappas Telecasting signed an affiliation agreement to make KPWB the market's CW affiliate. A few months later, MyNetworkTV {{announced that it would}} affiliate with a new station also owned by Pappas, KDMI (then on channel 56), which began broadcasting that network on September 5, 2006. On September 18, 2006, the date that The CW officially launched, KPWB changed its call letters to KCWI-TV to reflect its new affiliation. In 2013, the station's <b>logo</b> <b>switched</b> from the generic version that The CW had used since its inception to a version utilizing the station's call letters (this version is also being used by The CW's San Francisco O&O, KBCW-TV).|$|R
5000|$|With {{an entire}} offseason to prepare, Donruss shipped a much improved, more {{polished}} set for 1982. The 1982 offering {{also saw the}} introduction of the Diamond Kings, the first 26 cards of the 660-card set, made up of oil paintings by noted sports artist Dick Perez. Another Donruss innovation for 1982 was the inclusion of jigsaw puzzle pieces with a pack of cards in place of gum. Babe Ruth was pictured as [...] "Hall of Fame Diamond King" [...] when the 63-piece puzzle was assembled. (An appeal of the 1978 Fleer v. Topps ruling in 1981 barred the two new card companies from using gum premiums; Fleer <b>switched</b> to team <b>logo</b> stickers in 1982). Donruss also began selling to dealers directly, the first of the major card companies to offer factory sets for those buying in bulk. Notable card in this set is Cal Ripken's rookie card.|$|R
