This great mind is hoarded beyond the power of any single mind to possess it. Nevertheless (as they take so long finding one's walking-stick) one can't help thinking how one might come with a notebook, <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk,</b> and read it all through.

As my pocket-money was run out too (by coach-hire to and from home, five shillings to our maid at home, ten to my aunt's maid and man, five-and-twenty shillings lost at whist, as I said, and fifteen-and-six paid for a silver scissors for the dear little fingers of Somebody), Roundhand, who was very good-natured, asked me to dine, and advanced me 7l. 1s. 8d., a month's salary. It was at Roundhand's house, Myddelton Square, Pentonville, over a fillet of veal and bacon and a glass of port, that I learned and saw how his wife ill- treated him; as I have told before. Poor fellow!--we under-clerks all thought it was a fine thing to <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> by oneself, and have 50l. per month, as Roundhand had; but I've a notion that Hoskins and I, blowing duets on the flute together in our second floor in Salisbury Square, were a great deal more at ease than our head--and more in harmony, too; though we made sad work of the music, certainly.|$|E

50|$|Some desks {{have the}} form of a table, {{although}} usually only one side of a desk is suitable to sit at (there are some exceptions, such as a partners desk), unlike most usual tables. Some desks do not have {{the form of}} a table, for instance, an armoire desk is a desk built within a large wardrobe-like cabinet, and a portable desk is light enough to be placed on a person's lap. Since many people lean on a desk while using it, a desk must be sturdy. In most cases, people <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk,</b> either on a separate chair or a built-in chair (e.g., in some school desks).

50|$|CQ or {{charge of}} {{quarters}} is a tasked duty {{in which a}} United States armed forces service member is to guard the front entrance to the barracks. It is usually a 24-hour shift {{in which the two}} service members, one a non-commissioned officer (NCO) and the other a lower enlisted service member, <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> to monitor incoming and outgoing traffic into the barracks. There are usually additional duties, such as sweeping the entryway, cleaning the entrance restrooms, and checking the barracks laundry room for laundry left overnight. Other duties may include performing radio checks every few hours with other company barracks and battalion headquarters around the base or surrounding installations as well as bed checks to ensure service members are in their rooms with their doors locked by curfew. For example, some U.S. Armed Forces service members stationed in South Korea have a curfew for being on post, and another one for being in their own individual rooms with their doors locked.|$|E
5000|$|In May 1889, {{the first}} [...] "phonograph parlor" [...] opened in San Francisco. Customers would <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> {{where they could}} speak through a tube, and order a {{selection}} for one nickel. Through a separate tube connected to a cylinder phonograph in the room below, the selection would then be played. By the mid-1890s, most American cities {{had at least one}} phonograph parlor. Another common type of phonograph parlor featured a machine that would start or would be windable when a coin would be inserted. This jukebox-like phonograph was invented by Louis T. Glass and William S. Arnold. Many early machines were of the Edison Class M or Class E type. The Class M had a battery that would break if it fell or was smashed with another object. This would cause dangerous battery acid to spill everywhere. The Class E sold for a lower price and ran on 120V DC.|$|E

5000|$|Researchers {{carrying}} out Libet’s procedure would ask each participant to <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> {{in front of}} the oscilloscope timer. They would affix the EEG electrodes to the participant’s scalp, and would then instruct the subject to carry out some small, simple motor activity, such as pressing a button, or flexing a finger or wrist, within a certain time frame. No limits were placed on the number of times the subject could perform the action within this period. During the experiment, the subject would be asked to note the position of the dot on the oscilloscope timer when [...] "he/she was first aware of the wish or urge to act" [...] (control tests with Libet's equipment demonstrated a comfortable margin of error of only -50 milliseconds). Pressing the button also recorded the position of the dot on the oscillator, this time electronically. By comparing the marked time of the button's pushing and the subject's conscious decision to act, researchers were able to calculate the total time of the trial from the subject's initial volition through to the resultant action. On average, approximately two hundred milliseconds elapsed between the first appearance of conscious will to press the button and the act of pressing it.|$|E
30|$|During the {{face-to-face}} session, participants met individually {{with the}} interviewer {{in a quiet}} room on their campus. Each participant was greeted by the interviewer in Japanese and asked to <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> facing her. For each task, the interviewer read the instructions in Japanese that were written on the prompt card. She timed their preparation and gestured to the participants when to begin their responses. The interviewer recorded participants’ responses with a digital recorder. After the participants started responding to the tasks, the interviewer tried not to provide any verbal reaction except simple backchannels (e.g., mm-hm and uh-huh) with nodding and eye contact. Although {{the authenticity of the}} tasks may be questioned, the verbal reactions were controlled for three reasons. First, the narrative and opinion tasks were monologic; therefore, they required no interviewer input for completion. Second, limiting the potential variability in the interviewer’s verbal reactions was desirable for issues related to task reliability. Finally, minimizing verbal reactions allowed for consistency with previous research (O’Loughlin 2001).|$|E
40|$|Participants ’ {{fingers were}} guided to 2 {{locations}} {{on a table}} for 3 s, {{then back to the}} start. They reported distances and angles between the locations by (a) replacing 1 or 2 fingers, (b) translating the contacted configuration, or (c) estimating distance or angle alone. Distance error increased across these conditions. Angular error increased when the angular reference axis was rotated before the response. Replacing 1 finger was impaired by a change in posture from exposure to test. The results suggest a kinesthetic representation is used to replace the fingers, but to estimate distance and angle at new locations, a configural representation is computed. This representation is oriented within an extrinsic reference frame and maintains shape more accurately than scale. When people <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> or table, the region of space within reach of their hands, called peripersonal or manipulatory space (Lederman, Klatzky, Collins, & Wardell, 1987), typically holds a variety of tangibly distinct surfaces or objects. Often sparse touch, that is, contact with just one or two locations, is sufficient to determine the layout of objects and guide further reaching and manipulation. Consider a hypothetical scenario in which you pu...|$|E

5000|$|Sarah Hemming {{reviewed}} The Complete Deaths in the Financial Times: 'The history plays {{become a}} whistle-stop tour of extinction. <b>A</b> merciless official <b>sits</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> activating <b>a</b> giant buzzer when anyone bites the dust. Attempts at serious artistry — a Pina Bausch-style Macbeth, Aitor Basauri’s “proper” Shakespearean acting, Toby Park’s stern pronouncements {{about the artist}} as “agitator” — are all undercut by the inescapable power of the ridiculous. But the meta-theatrical nonsense disguises a genuine meta-theatrical exploration. Sneaking in under the pratfalls is a sincere investigation of how theatre can — and does — measure up to death. Actors can eat, sweat and weep for real on stage, but they cannot die. Stage deaths are inherently absurd. And yet. Hamlet “dies” in a bloodbath, but not before Shakespeare has brought him — and us — to contemplate the meaning of mortality.' ...|$|R

40|$|Does {{a preoccupation}} with one’s Facebook {{activity}} divert {{attention away from}} social cues? Eighty-six undergraduates browsed their NewsFeed on Facebook and composed a potential status update on paper about a personally meaningful event. Participants were then randomly assigned to either post the status update on Facebook {{so that it was}} visible to their Facebook friends, or continue passively browsing their friends’ Facebook content. A cue to one’s broader social network was also manipulated in the background, such that participants were randomly assigned to either <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> with a mobile phone or notebook. Participants who sat at a desk with a notebook showed significantly higher private self-awareness than those who were exposed to a mobile phone (p =. 015). Compared to those who read their NewsFeed, participants who posted a status update indicated they were significantly more distracted by thoughts of their Facebook activity (p <. 001), experienced more uncertainty (p =. 007), and felt more negative affect (p =. 016). Participants who posted a status update also reported marginally less engagement to clips of social interactions (p =. 060), and scored slightly lower on standardized items of a social perspective-taking task (p =. 066), in comparison to those who read their friend’s content in their NewsFeed. Models for mediation were non-significant, suggesting that although posting a status update relates to higher Facebook-related distraction, negative affect, uncertainty, and somewhat lower scores on a social perspective-taking task, Facebook-related distraction, negative affect, and uncertainty did not explain why participants who posted a status update performed somewhat worse at integrating social cues. Results are discussed in light of the consequences associated with switching one’s attention between virtual and physical environments. Future research should address broader implications of this effect for interpersonal relationships...|$|E

50|$|The most {{important}} {{point in their}} scholarship {{with respect to this}} issue is that immaterial labor, of which affective labor is a specific form, has achieved dominance in the current mode of production. This does not mean that there are more immaterial laborers than material laborers, or that immaterial labor produces more capital than material labor. Instead, this dominance is signaled by the fact that, in developed countries, labor is more often figured as immaterial than material. To illustrate the significance of this claim, they draw a comparison between the early twenty-first century and that of the mid-nineteenth century, famously engaged by Karl Marx, in which factory labor was dominant even if it was not the form of labor practiced by the most people. One popular, albeit slightly less than perfect example, of this might be that, whereas Fred Flintstone, as an average American, drove a crane in a quarry, Homer Simpson <b>sits</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> and provides safety.|$|R

50|$|For {{conservation}} reasons {{works on}} paper cannot be permanently displayed, as light, temperature and humidity conditions leave them vulnerable to damage, normally limiting an open display {{to no more than}} 6 months.

Where possible, they are mounted on archivally safe supports, but large collections still contain less important items loose in boxes. Storage may {{be in the same room}} as the viewing is done (the 'Reading-' or 'Study Room'), but as the largest collections have well over a million items stores are often located 'behind the scenes', along with the curators' offices.
