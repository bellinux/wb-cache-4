40|$|Abadi has {{introduced}} a logic to explicate the meaning of local names in SDSI, the <b>Simple</b> <b>Distributed</b> Security Infrastructure proposed by Rivest and Lampson. Abadi's logic does not correspond precisely to SDSI, however; it draws conclusions about local names that do not follow from SDSI's name resolution algorithm. Moreover, its semantics is somewhat unintuitive. This paper presents the Logic of Local Name Containment, which does not suer from these deciencies. It has a clear semantics and provides a tight characterization of SDSI name resolution. The semantics is shown to be closely related to that of logic programs, leading to an approach to the ecient implementation of queries concerning local names. A complete axiomatization of the logic is also provided. 1 Introduction Rivest and Lampson [RL 96] introduced SDSI|a <b>Simple</b> <b>Distributed</b> Security Infrastructure| to facilitate the construction of secure systems. 1 In SDSI, principals (agents) are identied with public keys.

30|$|The results {{provided}} {{in the previous section}} are encouraging as they indicate that one can develop <b>simple</b> <b>distributed</b> algorithms whose worst-case throughput is a nonvanishing fraction of the capacity region. Note that the results are obtained by admitting an arbitrarily small fraction of weights at a time slot, on the basis of geometric properties of unit-disk graphs. Although we have shown in Corollary 6 that MWKVMP cannot be approximated within a constant factor in general network graphs, it still remains unclear whether a <b>simple</b> <b>distributed</b> algorithm like the maximal scheduling policy can achieve a constant fraction of the capacity region in general network graphs. In the following, we show that the geometric constraints are indeed crucial to achieve the constant fraction of capacity region. To elaborate, we show that the greedy algorithm (and thus, the maximal scheduling policy as well) can achieve an arbitrarily small fraction of the capacity region in general network graphs.|$|R
