40|$|As mobile ad hoc {{networks}} {{emerge as}} a promising solution for future ubiquitous communications, there is a compelling demand to design a reliable method for supporting good quality video considering the increasing importance of video applications over the cyberspace nowadays. As commonly known, video application is usually associated with rigid requirements on bandwidth, lost, delay and jitter. Moreover, {{it is a great}} challenge to support video in ad hoc networks due to the frequent link breakage and the lack of centralized management system. In this dissertation, we tackle the problem of video unicast and multicast over mobile ad hoc networks using the concept of path and server diversities. The potential of this concept lies on the mesh topology of a mobile ad hoc network that allows each node to be virtually connected to any other node as long as a valid <b>single</b> <b>hop</b> or multiple <b>hops</b> <b>connection</b> can be established between them. To tackle the issue of video unicast in mobile ad hoc networks, we propose a framework that combines Multipoint-to-Point (MP 2 P) communication an...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} how multi-hop routing affects the goodput and throughput performances of IEEE 802. 11 distributed coordination function-based wireless networks compared with direct transmission (<b>single</b> <b>hopping),</b> when {{medium access control}} dynamics such as carrier sensing, collisions, retransmissions, and exponential backoff {{are taken into account}} under hidden terminal presence. We propose a semi-Markov chain-based goodput and throughput model for IEEE 802. 11 -based wireless networks, which works accurately with both multi-hopping and <b>single</b> <b>hopping</b> for different network topologies and over a large range of traffic loads. Results show that, under light traffic, there is little benefit of parallel transmissions and both single-hop and multi-hop routing achieve the same end-to-end goodput. Under moderate traffic, concurrent transmissions are favorable as multi-hopping improves the goodput up to 730 % with respect to <b>single</b> <b>hopping</b> for dense networks. At heavy traffic, multi-hopping becomes unstable because of increased packet collisions and network congestion, and single-hopping achieves higher network layer goodput compared with multi-hop routing. As for the link layer throughput is concerned, multi-hopping increases throughput 75 times for large networks, whereas <b>single</b> <b>hopping</b> may become advantageous for small networks. The results point out that the end-to-end goodput can be improved by adaptively switching between <b>single</b> <b>hopping</b> and multi-hopping according to the traffic load and topology...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} cost based {{comparative}} study of homogeneous and heterogeneous clustered sensor networks. We focus on the case where the base station is remotely located and the sensor nodes are not mobile. Since we {{are concerned with the}} overall network dimensioning problem, we take into account the manufacturing cost of the hardware as well as the battery energy of the nodes. A homogeneous sensor network consists of identical nodes, while a heterogeneous sensor network consists of two or more types of nodes (organized into hierarchical clusters). We first consider <b>single</b> <b>hop</b> clustered sensor networks (nodes use <b>single</b> <b>hopping</b> to reach the cluster heads). We use LEACH as the representative <b>single</b> <b>hop</b> homogeneous network, and a sensor network with two types of nodes as a representative <b>single</b> <b>hop</b> heterogeneous network. For multi-hop homogeneous networks (nodes use multi-hopping to reach the cluster head), we propose and analyze a multi-hop variant of LEACH that we call M-LEACH. We show that M-LEACH has better energy efficiency than LEACH in many cases. We then compare the cost of multi-hop clustered sensor networks with M-LEACH as the representative homogeneous network, and a sensor network with two types of nodes (that use in-cluster multi-hopping) as the representative heterogeneous network.

40|$|Abstract — Wireless {{reprogramming}} of {{the sensor}} network {{is useful for}} uploading new code or for changing the functionality of the existing code. In recent years, the research focus has shifted from <b>single</b> <b>hop</b> reprogramming to multi-hop reprogramming primarily because of its ease of use. Practical experience from a multi-hop sensor network for monitoring water pollution, called CSOnet, deployed in South Bend, IN, indicates that single-hop reprogramming may be preferable under certain conditions to minimize reprogramming time and energy. In this, the user gets close to a node to be reprogrammed and wirelessly reprograms a single node at a time. The choice between <b>single</b> <b>hop</b> and multi-hop reprogramming depends on factors like network size, node density and most importantly, link reliabilities. We present a protocol called DStream having both single and multi-hop reprogramming capabilities. We provide mathematical analysis and results from testbed experiments (including experiments conducted on CSOnet networks) and simulations to give insights into {{the choice of the}} two reprogramming methods for various network parameters.
