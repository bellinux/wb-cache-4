This buyer has made progress payments, but Kylara suspects {{that he intends to}} steal the ships and rushes to organize her fleet into something that can meet his at Moray. She partially succeeds, denying the pirate lord much of his fleet, but her own flagship Vanguard strikes a minefield and explodes. Her cousins and friends believe her dead, a fiction she fosters in hopes of catching Turek off guard during a future engagement. Rafael Dunbarger continues to purge ISC of elements in league with Turek or merely incompetent, eventually discovering that this rot reaches into the government of Nexus. His fleet in disrepair due the machinations of Lewis Parmina, Rafe struggles to salvage enough fighting ships and men to assist in the defense of Nexus. He discovers that his sister, largely recovered from her mistreatment at the hands of Parmina's henchmen, has the strength and wits to assist him in running ISC. He'll need that help, because Turek and his fleet have set their sights on Nexus. If they can conquer it, they will control all galactic communications save for a handful of individuals with semi-portable ansible units. Ultimately, Kylara's new Space Defense Fleet combines with elements of the ISC fleet, <b>Slotter</b> Key Spaceforce, Moscoe Confederation and ships of the Mackensee Military Assistance Corporation in a huge battle for control of Nexus. There are many losses, but ultimately Kylara confronts a desperate Gammis Turek as he sends his doomed flagship in a suicide run towards Nexus.

40|$|Abstract: Tectonic stress i {{one of the}} {{fundamental}} data sets inEarth sciences comparable with topography, gravity, heat flow and others. The importance of stress observations for both aca-demic research (e. g. geodynamics, plate tectonics) and applied sciences (e. g. hydrocarbon pro-duction, civil engineering) proves the necessity of a project like the World Stress Map for com-piling and making available stress data on global scale. The World Stress Map project offers not only free access to this global database via the Internet, but also continues in its effort to expand and improve the database, to develop new quality criteria, and to initiate topical research projects. In this paper we present (a) the new release of the World Stress Map, (b) expanded quality ranking schemes for borehole breakouts and geological indicators, (c) new stress indi-cators (drilling-induced fractures, borehole <b>slotter</b> data) nd their quality ranking schemes, and (d) examples for the application of tectonic stress data.

40|$|The World Stress Map (WSM) Project was {{initiated}} in 1986 {{under the auspices}} of the International Lithosphere Program in order to compile globally the information on the contemporary crustal stress state. For the 30 th anniversary the WSM database has been updated and increased the number of data records from 21, 750 to 42, 410 worldwide. For the Mediterranean and Central European stress map the number of data records has increased from 3877 to 8192. The data come from a wide range of stress indicators such as borehole data (e. g. hydraulic fracturing, drilling induced tensile fractures, borehole breakouts), earthquake focal mechanism solutions and stress inversions from these, engineering methods (overcoring, borehole <b>slotter)</b> and geological data (e. g. volcanic alignment, inversion of fault slip data). To guarantee the comparability of the different stress indicator the resulting data are quality-ranked using the WSM quality ranking scheme. The new data set has a better coverage and enables us to identifying the regional and local variability of the stress pattern. For the Mediterranean and Central Europe we analysed the wave-length of the stress pattern by determining the mean orientation of the maximum horizontal stress SHmax on a regular grid using an updated version of the hybrid approach of Heidbach et al. [2010]. The preliminary results show that the Africa-Eurasia plate convergence is a key control of the overall stress pattern. However, given the complex tectonic setting in particular due to the indentation/collision of the Adriatic micro block, the Alpine topography as well as forces that control the movement of the Anatolian and Aegean block, the stress pattern shows in these regions significant changes in the mean SHmax orientation as well as in the tectonic regime...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} the initial results of long-range research on bit life {{conducted by the}} Bureau of Mines. Three commercial bit designs -a round-nose radial, 6020 conical, and 9020 conical with tungsten carbide (WC) inserts -and five experimental bits were tested. Four of the experimental bits were radial designs using polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) inserts. The fifth was a 9020 conical with an oversize WC insert. Bits were worn on a high-silica sandstone typical of coal mine roofs. The bits were mounted on a 34 -in-diam drum section that provided a bit speed of 565 ft/min. Cutting forces were measured on a modified vertical <b>slotter</b> using a three-axis force dynamometer and recorded on an FM magnetic tape recorder. Changes in cutting forces, bit weight, and airborne dust due to gradual abrasive wear and catastrophic insert failure are presented. Tabulated and graphed data, photographs of the progression of bit wear, and selected qualitative visual and auditory observations of the bits taken throughout the experiment {{are found in the}} appendixes. The results show that bit life ranged from approximately 16, 000 ft for the WC round-nose radial bit to over 125, 000 ft for a PDC round-nose radial. Performance, in terms of bit life, cutting forces, wear rate, frictional sparking, machine vibration, and noise was in general best with the PDC bits, followed by the rotating WC bits, with the nonrotating WC bits (round-nose radial and locked 6020 conical) being the worst. The results show variations in the included tip angles of new conical bits have an insignificant influence on bit performance when the effects are averaged {{over the life of the}} bit. In addition, new bits were generally found to entrain more primary respirable dust for a given cutting distance than worn-out bits. It is hypothesized that this is due to the difference in frictional behavior between new and worn bits. The results from these tests are being used in the Bureau's cutting system model (CSM) ...|$|E

40|$|Wanting {{to expand}} the self by {{incorporating}} aspects of close others into one 2 ̆ 7 s self-concept is a natural human motivation (Aron 2 ̆ 6 Aron, 1986). However, people high in attachment anxiety have a greater desire than those low in attachment anxiety to increase closeness in romantic relationships, causing them to experience greater confusion in their sense of self (<b>Slotter</b> 2 ̆ 6 Gardner, 2012) and greater emotional distress when their relationships end (Barbara 2 ̆ 6 Dion, 2000). The present study sought to investigate how this desire for greater closeness for individuals high in attachment anxiety may result in negative outcomes for the self. Given that anxious attachment is associated with depression and low self-esteem (Hankin, Kassel, 2 ̆ 6 Abela, 2005), the present study aimed to examine desire for greater closeness as a partial mediator of the associations of attachment anxiety with self-esteem and depressive symptoms. A total of 245 participants (167 currently in romantic relationships, and 78 not currently in romantic relationships) completed an online survey containing measures of current and desired closeness for their romantic relationships (if {{they were in a}} relationship) and friendships, as well as measures of attachment, self-esteem, and depressive symptoms. I predicted that desire for greater closeness in romantic relationships, but not friendships, would be higher for people high in attachment anxiety, and that this desire would partially mediate associations of attachment anxiety with self-esteem and depressive symptoms. Results were that attachment anxiety in both friendships and romantic relationships was associated with lower self-esteem and greater depressive symptoms. In romantic relationships, desire for greater closeness was not associated with attachment anxiety, self-esteem, or depressive symptoms. Attachment anxiety in friendships predicted desire for greater closeness to one 2 ̆ 7 s best friend, but desire for greater closeness in friendships did not mediate associations of attachment anxiety with self-esteem and depressive symptoms because it did not predict these outcomes. Findings suggest that attachment anxiety is an important area of focus in treatment for clients presenting with low self-esteem and/or depressive symptoms. Future research may examine what other factors may serve as mediators of associations of attachment anxiety with self-esteem and depressive symptoms, such as relationship satisfaction or conflict within relationships. ^ Keywords: attachment anxiety; close relationships; depressive symptoms; desire for greater closeness; inclusion of other in self; self-esteem...|$|E
40|$|The World Stress Map is a {{standard}} global compilation {{of information on the}} present-day stress field of the Earth's crust including: earthquake focal mechanisms, well bore breakouts and drilling-induced fractures, in-situ stress measurements (overcoring, hydraulic fracturing, borehole <b>slotter)</b> and young geologic data (from fault-slip analysis and volcanic vent alignments). This compilation and several single papers have clearly proved the existence of a first-order stress field controlled by plate boundary forces, and a second-order stress field (regional) controlled by major intraplate stress sources, such as topography, density, strength contrasts and major fault systems. In areas where high data density is present, a third order stress field (local) can also be accounted, linked to the presence of minor geological features (i. e. active faults, local inclusions, detachment horizons or density contrasts). The local stress orientations in some cases overrule the first- and second-order stress pattern: major discontinuities within a rock mass disturb the stress field causing localized increases in differential stress and an associated change in the orientation of the stress trajectory. Stress field at local scale can be recognized by detailed analysis of stress measurements, low magnitude earthquake focal solutions and minor tectonics features. In particular, the breakout analysis points out that stress perturbation occurs in a well - with depth - when open fractures, or recently slipped faults or mechanically weak zones are crossed by, or close to, the borehole. The free surfaces of an open fracture in a rock body deflect stress trajectories in the closer surrounding area, so the smallest principal stress approaches the free surface at right angle. The stress field rotates in proximity to an active fault due to small slip increments on the fault, possibly induced by the tectonic movement or due to an increase of pore pressure on the fault when drilling through it. Stress rotations identified near active (or young) faults {{can be used to make}} assumptions about the strength of the fault zone compared with the surrounding rock mass. In fact shear zones usually show physical properties different from the nearby undamaged rock: these features can be recorded by downhole logs and then compared to stress data. On the contrary, if any stress perturbation occurs close to a fault, this latter can be considered a sealed fault with characteristics similar to the host rock body. Here, we present some examples relative to small-scale stress rotations related to the presence of active faults gathered from borehole breakout and focal mechanism analysis in some areas of Italy...|$|E
40|$|In soils with subsoil acidity, root {{growth of}} plants {{sensitive}} to acidity {{is restricted to}} surface layers resulting in reduced water and nutrient uptake and low yields of crops. In the present study, {{the use of the}} lime-slotting technique, with slots 0 - 15 m wide and 02 ̆ 78 m deep, for providing long-term improvements of the adverse soil chemical and physical characteristics of an acid, clay soil was investigated. Lime-slotting using a rotary <b>slotter</b> resulted in a uniform increase in soil pH to the full depth of the slot (0 - 8 m), indicating a thorough mixing of the lime with the small soil fragments produced by slotting, as they are thrown up into the rotor shroud and redeposited in the slot. In contrast, ripping to l- 0 m depth and delve ploughing to 0 - 8 m depth only changed the soil pH close to the soil surface. The saturated hydraulic conductivity, total porosity and air-filled porosity at a potential of — 10 kPa measured on soil cores was significantly (P < 0 - 05) increased within the slot, compared to the undisturbed soil. Values of unsaturated hydraulic conductivities K(9) and diffusivities D(9), calculated from the saturated conductivity and water potential-water content relationships, also showed increases in the slot, at high water contents. Although a polishing of sections of the slot wall due to rubbing of the rotors was observed in the field, the saturated conductivities of the cores taken across the slot walls did not show significant (P < 0 - 05) differences compared with the undisturbed soil adjacent to the slot. The extent of protection of the loosened soil in the slots from recompaction during subsequent farm trafficking was evaluated in a vineyard. Soil strength measurement showed distinct differences between field plots which were non-ameliorated, lime-slotted or deep ripped. Soil strength was estimated using penetrometer cone index measurements, which were made when the soils were at similar water contents. Zones of high soil strength observed in the non-ameliorated soils, were reduced in the ripped and slotted soil. However, {{the upper part of the}} ripped soil had soil strengths higher than the lower part, indicating repacking under trafficking. In contrast in the slotted soil, the slotted area had low soil strength to depth, indicating greater protection of the loosened soil during trafficking. This could be due to bridging of the tractor wheels and implements across the slot on to the stronger undisturbed soil on either side. Thus, lime-slotting is an effective technique for long-term amelioration of the adverse physical and chemical properties of dense clay soils with subsoil acidity. This should encourage root growth to depth within the slots, and use of the water stored in the subsoil...|$|E
