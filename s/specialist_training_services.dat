30|$|As {{the time}} {{required}} to apply a tool decreases, it becomes increasingly practical for widespread use in time-sensitive decision-making processes. We evaluated each tool based on a rough estimate of its time requirements to provide results for a “standard” restoration analyst (i.e., a Masters-level <b>specialist</b> <b>trained</b> in ecosystem <b>service</b> analysis, including GIS and/or economic valuation). Additionally, evaluations reflect time requirements to develop customized input data, to run, test, and calibrate models, and to apply scenario analysis. Rapid assessment tools were ranked as 1; time-intensive tools were ranked as 3.|$|R

25|$|In 1892, the London and South Western Railway Company {{purchased}} Southampton Docks. By 1897, {{the existing}} Southampton Terminus, the South Western Hotel, a large goods yard and a turntable {{had all been}} established, with railway lines running across Canute Road and into {{every corner of the}} docks. The interaction between trains and other traffic was controlled by men with red flags. This close relationship between the docks and the railways allowed <b>specialist</b> Boat <b>Train</b> <b>services</b> to be developed that connected with the transatlantic liners, trains ultimately terminating at full-length platforms housed within the Ocean Terminal. Trains also ran directly on to the Royal Pier to connect with ferry services to Portsmouth, Ryde and Cowes. The nearby Cattle Market was also well served by the railway. The decline of transatlantic passenger liners in favour of quicker air routes, the development of Southampton Container Terminal, which transferred dock traffic to Millbrook and the electrification of the South Western Main Line to London, all affected the economics of |Southampton Terminus. Passenger services ceased on 9 September 1966 but the terminus continued to be used for parcels until March 1968. Southampton Central, originally Southampton West, is now the main railway station for Southampton.|$|R
40|$|Developing {{countries}} shoulder {{a considerable}} burden of gastroenterological disease. Infectious diseases in particular cause enormous morbidity and mortality. Diseases which afflict both western {{and developing countries}} are often seen in more florid forms in poorer countries. Innovative techniques continuously improve and update gastroenterological practice. However, advances in diagnosis and treatment which are commonplace in the West, have yet to reach many developing countries. Clinical guidelines, based on these advances and collated in resource-rich environments, lose their relevance outside these settings. In this two-part review, we first highlight the global burden of gastroenterological disease in three major areas: diarrhoeal diseases, hepatitis B, and Helicobacter pylori. Recent progress in their management is explored, with consideration of future solutions. The {{second part of the}} review focuses on the delivery of clinical services in developing countries. Inadequate numbers of healthcare workers hamper efforts to combat gastroenterological disease. Reasons for this shortage are examined, along with possibilities for increased <b>specialist</b> <b>training.</b> Endoscopy <b>services,</b> the mainstay of gastroenterology in the West, are in their infancy in many developing countries. The challenges faced by those setting up a service are illustrated by the example of a Nigerian endoscopy unit. Finally, we highlight the limited scope of many clinical guidelines produced in western countries. Guidelines which take account of resource limitations in the form of “cascades” are advocated in order to make these guidelines truly global. Recognition of the different working conditions facing practitioners worldwide is an important step towards narrowing the gap between gastroenterology in rich and poor countries...|$|R

50|$|RTU'ing is {{a concept}} used {{during a period of}} <b>specialist</b> <b>training,</b> whereby a <b>service</b> person has been {{extracted}} or detached from their home unit. For example, if a service person has been extracted to complete an instruction course run by a specialist unit within the armed forces such as a PTI or Range Control course. In the event of the service person wishing to withdraw from the course (e.g. for personal or medical reasons); or if the course supervisors deem that the service person is unfit to complete the course, for either medical or disciplinary reasons, the service person may be returned to their home unit. If a candidate is RTU'd, the supervisor responsible for sending them home will supply a written report to the service person's OC detailing the reason why they have been RTU'd. If a service person is RTU'd on disciplinary grounds, their OC will decide if any further disciplinary action is needed, based on the RTU report from the course supervisor, and if necessary, by consultation with the course supervisors. The reason this is done is that, according to military law, disciplinary action such as a court-martial can only by issued against a service person by their home unit.|$|R
