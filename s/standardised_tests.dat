25|$|Students in Chinese {{independent}} {{high schools}} take <b>standardised</b> <b>tests</b> {{known as the}} Unified Examination Certificate (UEC) {{at the end of}} Junior Middle 3 and Senior Middle 3. UEC has been run by UCSCAM since 1975. The UEC is available in three levels: Vocational Unified Exam (UEC-V), UEC Junior Middle Level (UEC-JML/JUEC) and Senior Middle Level (UEC-SML/SUEC). The syllabus and examinations for the UEC-V and UEC-JML are only available in the Chinese language. The UEC-SML has questions for mathematics, sciences (biology, chemistry and physics), bookkeeping, accounting and commerce in both Chinese and English.|$|E
25|$|Students then {{enter an}} {{intermediate}} college and complete grades 11 and 12. Upon completion {{of each of}} the two grades, they again take <b>standardised</b> <b>tests</b> in their academic subjects. Upon successful completion of these examinations, students are awarded the Higher Secondary School Certificate (or HSSC). This level of education is also called the FSc/FA/ICS or 'intermediate'. There are many streams students can choose for their 11 and 12 grades, such as pre-medical, pre-engineering, humanities (or social sciences), computer science and commerce. Each stream consists of three electives and as well as three compulsory subjects of English, Urdu, Islamiat (grade 11 only) and Pakistan Studies (grade 12 only).|$|E

500|$|Although early opponents {{suggested}} the Pūnana Leo schools would harm students' academic development, graduates {{from the schools}} have achieved several measures of academic success in later life. This is true {{despite the fact that}} the emphasis of the schools is on language revitalization rather than academic achievement: [...] "Immersion students have garnered prestigious scholarships, enrolled in college courses while still in high school, and passed the state university's English composition assessments, despite receiving the majority of their English, science and mathematics instruction in Hawaiian. Student achievement on <b>standardised</b> <b>tests</b> has equalled... surpassed that of Native Hawaiian children enrolled in English language schools, even in English language arts [...]" [...] These academic benefits come in addition to language revitalization and an increased realization of cultural pride.|$|E
5000|$|As {{has been}} {{mentioned}} before, gymnasia and Gesamtschulen in Germany do not administer <b>standardised</b> <b>tests</b> to their students and few students are familiar with those kinds of tests. Yet, scientists sometimes use <b>standardised</b> <b>tests</b> to evaluate schools. 10th graders attending a gymnasium {{have been shown to}} outperform 10th graders attending a comprehensive school by one standard deviation on a standardised mathematics test. That equals 2 to 3 years of schooling. Proponents of comprehensive schools have criticised such studies, stating they believe <b>standardised</b> <b>tests</b> to be biased against those attending comprehensive school. They have said comprehensives taught their students [...] "Independence, capacity for team work, creativity, conflict management and broad mindedness" [...] and that those qualities cannot be measured on <b>standardised</b> <b>tests.</b>|$|E
