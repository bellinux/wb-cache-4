40|$|Electric quality {{problems}} associated with power interactions between distribution and industrial process control systems can be prevented. Surveys of large users that buy power at the transmission and distribution voltages turn up relatively few complaints {{about the quality of}} their incoming power, while surveys of small users connected at secondary voltages tum up numerous complaints about the quality of their incoming power. Three major changes in the characteristics of customer loads and power distribution systems have altered the nature of the power quality equation: (I) greater sensitivity of devices and equipment to electric power variations, (2) the interconnection of sensitive loads in extensive networks and automated processes, and (3) an increase in loads that use power electronics in some type of power conversion configuration [1][2]. This paper presents applications of the constant-voltage transformer (CVT) for mitigating the effects of electric <b>service</b> <b>voltage</b> sags on industrial equipment in an oil refinery.

40|$|Today, the {{insulation}} of overhead transmission lines with composite insulators is common practice world-wide. A large variety of designs of such insulators {{is available on}} the market for all currently used <b>service</b> <b>voltage</b> levels. It is well known that the electrical field distribution of insulator sets equipped with composite insulators differ from those equipped with “conven-tional “ insulators (ceramic longrod, ceramic or glass cap and pin type insulators). Generally, the field distribution of a composite longrod insulator set is more non-linear than of a set with conventional insulators. This is caused by missing intermediate metal parts and by the dielectric material characteristics of the polymeric materials used for composite insulators. The field distribution along non-polluted composite insulators is mainly influenced by the earth and high voltage (hv) capacitances. The real situation can only be calculated numerically e. g. using the Finite Element Method (FEM). The tower arrangement of an insulator set and its clearances to tower crossarms and to the shaft are of great importance for the electrical field distribution. Furtheron, the influence on the electrical field characteristics in dependence on the composite insulator design is studied. Proposals for optimum designs are discussed.

Ancillary services can be classified in: (a) active power ancillary services (load&# 8211;frequency control (LFC) &# 8212;including primary control, automatic generation control (AGC), tertiary control, balancing service and black start provision) and (b) reactive power ancillary <b>services</b> (<b>voltage</b> control).

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The overall {{electricity}} access rate {{is still very}} low in most sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. The rate is even lower in rural areas {{where most of the}} population in these countries lives. One of the main obstacles to rural electrification (RE) is the high cost of laying the distribution infrastructure owing to the dispersed nature of loads and low demand. Thus, electrifying the rural areas needs to be considered holistically and not just on the financial viability. To reduce cost, it is important that un-conventional rural electrification (URE) technologies, which are cheaper than the conventional ones be explored. Un-conventional rural electrification (URE) technologies have been tried successfully {{in some parts of the}} world. However, the literature review showed that no work had so far been done with regard to maximum penetration level of these technologies on power transmission networks, especially the Capacitor Coupled Substation (CCS) and Auxiliary <b>Service</b> <b>Voltage</b> Transformers (ASVTs).

The Solar Decathlon 2011 {{was held in}} Washington, D. C., from September 23 to October 2, 2011. A high-penetration microgrid was designed, installed, and operated for the Solar Decathlon 2011 to grid-connect 19 highly energy-efficient, solar-powered competition houses to a single utility connection point. The capacity penetration of this microgrid (defined as maximum PV generation divided by maximum system load over a two-week period) was 74 % based on 1 -minute averaged data. Temporary, ground-laid conductors and electrical distribution equipment were installed to grid-connect the Solar Decathlon village, which included the houses {{as well as other}} electrical loads used by the event organizers.

40|$|As {{solar energy}} {{penetration}} {{in the power}} grid increases, challenges arise from the variable nature of solar power. Like any distributed generation source or load, photovoltaic (PV) generation can impact the voltage profile of a distribution feeder, potentially driving the <b>service</b> <b>voltage</b> outside of acceptable ranges. However, distributed energy resources can also bring great opportunities to improve power quality and cost effectiveness of the current power grid. In this dissertation, we will examine different strategies to increase solar PV penetration while complying with voltage standards and maximizing economic benefits of PV systems. The dissertation {{is divided into three}} main areas. The first one covers our solar forecasting technology using sky imagery and proposes an improvement to the current cloud height calculation using a stereographic method with multiple sky imagers.

Quasi steady-state power flow simulations at different solar penetration levels and cloud conditions are forced by site-specific solar resource data obtained from high resolution sky imagery. The impacts of variable solar power on voltage fluctuations, high frequency and magnitude power ramps, and transformer tap operations will be considered. The final area investigates how smart solar PV inverters can resolve voltage issues on distribution feeders. Once reactive power injection by smart inverters is allowed, overvoltages during midday and undervoltages during the evening can be avoided given a sufficient number of smart inverters on the distribution feeder. An analysis on generic feeders is followed up with a field test that demonstrates the potential benefits of smart inverters...|$|E

30|$|As the {{adoption}} of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) continue to increase, the power grid experiences new challenges in terms of grid stability, reliability, power quality and harmonics [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. This has led to extensive research on bidirectional PEV chargers that feature grid-to-vehicle (G 2 V) operations for battery charging as well as vehicle-to-grid (V 2 G) operations. V 2 G operations of bidirectional PEV chargers are highly attractive due to the potential of PEVs fulfilling the energy storage needs of the grid and assisting the grid in terms of providing active power for load leveling, reactive power support, ancillary <b>services,</b> <b>voltage</b> regulation, harmonic filtering and power factor correction [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Supplying reactive power using on-board chargers that are connected to a distribution system has some inherent disadvantages, such as the mobility and the power limitation of on-board chargers [15, 16]. V 2 G services using off-board chargers are more advantageous compared with using on-board chargers since off-board stations are stationary and are rated at higher power levels. Hence, the utility grid can compensate respective stations via an annual agreement [15].|$|R

This again showed the dynamic nature of the SVC, absorbing reactive power in period of high voltage and supplying reactive power when low voltage occur...|$|R
