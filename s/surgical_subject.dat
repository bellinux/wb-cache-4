40|$|UnrestrictedResidents in {{surgical}} residency {{programs are}} taught through a hands-on apprenticeship {{under the supervision}} of <b>surgical</b> <b>subject</b> matter experts despite the fact that those experts are largely unaware of the automated strategies that guide most of their problem-solving. In fact, experts often omit as much as 70 % of the procedural knowledge that novices need to learn. This study examines the amount of procedural steps in an open cricothyrotomy procedure that can be learned from multiple <b>surgical</b> <b>subject</b> matter expert interviews using Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) techniques. CTA focuses on measuring the mental models used in task performance, capturing not only declarative knowledge but also procedural knowledge.; Using CTA-based interview techniques, six expert trauma surgeons employed by the Department of Surgery of a private, urban medical school in the western United States were separately interviewed about how to perform an open cricothyrotomy procedure. The interviews were coded and converted into ordered, procedural checklists that listed all of the equipment, conditions, action steps, and decision steps that each subject matter expert mentioned in his or her interview as being necessary to successfully perform the procedure. Those individual checklists were then converted into a single criterion standard, hereafter termed as the 'gold standard', for the open cricothyrotomy procedure against which each expert's checklist was graded for completeness.; This study found that, on average, each <b>surgical</b> <b>subject</b> matter expert who participated in this study omitted 44 % of the total steps, 34 % of the action steps, and 72 % of the decision steps contained within a six-expert open cricothyrotomy 'gold standard' procedure.

40|$|Since {{the wound}} {{is the most}} common focus of {{infection}} in the surgical patient, adequate levels of antibiotic within the wound ar essential. This study examines the concentrations of antibiotic achieved in human wounds. Fluid was collected at timed intervals on the first postoperative day from the wounds of 56 patients receiving antibiotics after regional lymph node dissection. Antibiotic concentration was determined by bioassay. Six antibiotics were studied: cephalothin, cefazolin, cephapirin, oxacillin, ampicillin and clindamycin. The cephalosporins and penicillins showed similar patterns of appearance in the wound fluid. The peak level occurred early (1 [...] 1 1 / 2 hours) with subsequent slow decrease. Clindamycin produced nearly constant levels in wound fluid. The concentration of each antibiotic in wound fluid surpassed the serum levels after 2. 5 hours. At the dosages studied each antibiotic produced wound fluid concentrations greater than the MIC for most susceptible organisms. Higher doses provided higher wound fluid levels.

40|$|Aims and Objectives The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} the effect that immersive simulation experiences and guided reflection can have on the undergraduate nurses’ understanding of how stressful environments impact their emotions, performance and ability to implement safe administration of medications. Background Patient safety can be jeopardised if nurses are unsure of how to appropriately manage and respond to interruptions. Medication administration errors are a major patient safety issue and often occur as a consequence of ineffective interruption management. The skills associated with medication administration are most often taught to, and performed by, undergraduate nurses in a controlled environment. However, the clinical environment in which nurses are expected to administer medications is often highly stressed and nurses are frequently interrupted. Design/Methods This study used role play simulation and written reflections to facilitate deeper levels of student self-awareness. A qualitative approach was taken to explore students’ understanding of the effects of interruptions on their ability to undertake safe medication administration. Convenience sampling of second year undergraduate nursing students enrolled in a medical <b>surgical</b> <b>subject</b> was used in this study. Data were obtained from 451 : 528 (85. 42 %) of those students and analysed using thematic analysis. Results Students reported increasing consciousness and the importance of reflection for evaluating performance and gaining self-awareness. They described self-awareness, effective communication, compassion and empathy as significant factors in facilitating self-efficacy and improved patient care outcomes. Conclusions Following a role play simulation experience student nurses reported new knowledge and skill acquisition related to patient safety, and new awareness of the need for empathetic and compassionate care during medication administration. Practicing medication administration in realistic settings adds to current strategies that aim to reduce medication errors by allowing students to reflect on and in practice and develop strategies to ensure patient safety...|$|E

40|$|Background—The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{long-term}} outcomes of children randomized to surgery or balloon angioplasty (BA) for native coarctation (CoA). A prior randomized, short-term comparison of BA and surgery for native CoA in 36 children demonstrated equivalent relief of obstruction. The risk of aneurysm formation and possibly restenosis was higher among patients treated with BA. Methods and Results—Blood pressure, residual aortic obstruction, and exercise performance were evaluated. Need for repeat intervention was reviewed. Aortic arch anatomy was assessed with magnetic resonance angiography. For subjects who were not available to return for evaluation, the most recent clinical record was utilized. Among the 36 subjects initially randomized, 21 returned for evaluation (11 BA, 10 surgery). The average time since initial intervention to evaluation for all subjects was 10. 64. 7 years for BA subjects and 11. 33. 7 years for <b>surgical</b> <b>subjects.</b> Resting blood pressure, CoA gradient, exercise performance, MRI analysis of the aortic arch, and need for repeat interventions were not different for the 2 treatment strategies. There was a higher incidence of aneurysm formation (35 % versus 0 %) and a greater difference in blood pressure between the right and left legs with exercise among BA subjects. Some aneurysms developed late, first being detected more than 5 years after the initial intervention. Only 50 % of BA subjects remained free of both aneurysm formation and repeat intervention compared with 87. 5 % of <b>surgical</b> <b>subjects</b> (P 0. 03).

30|$|Tissue {{inhibitor}} of metalloproteinases- 2 (TIMP- 2) and insulin-like {{growth factor}} binding protein 7 (IFGBP 7) {{have recently been}} suggested as promising tools for the early detection of AKI in critically ill patients [8]. Both proteins are inducers of the G 1 cell cycle arrest, considered as a key mechanism of AKI. In the Sapphire study enrolling 744 critically ill medical and <b>surgical</b> <b>subjects</b> with a moderate–severe AKI occurring in 14  % of patients, the combination of TIMP- 2 and IGFBP 7 was significantly superior to all other existing markers of AKI with an AUC of 0.80 and also better than TIMP– 2 (AUC 0.76) and IGFBP 7 (AUC 0.79) alone [9]. Others could confirm these findings showing that urinary [TIMP- 2]*[IGFBP 7] greater than 0.3 (ng/ml) 2 / 1000 is able to identify patients at risk for imminent AKI [10]. In addition, urinary [TIMP- 2]*[IGFBP 7] is able to predict AKI and renal recovery early after cardiac surgery in a subgroup of patients with a high risk {{for the development of}} AKI defined by a high Cleveland Foundation Score [11]. Therefore, it was the aim of the present study to analyze the postoperative course of [TIMP 2]*[IGFBP 7] to evaluate a new diagnostic approach for early detection of AKI in patients after isolated CABG.|$|R

We prospectively evaluated whether measurement of the total serum calcium (Ca) concentration or calculation of the serum ionized Ca level (by the McLean-Hastings nomogram) accurately reflects the measured serum ionized Ca level. Although 71 % and 58 % of 156 predominantly surgical intensive care unit (ICU) patients were hypocalcemic by the total serum Ca or calculated ionized Ca level, respectively, only 12 % were hypocalcemic by directly measured serum ionized Ca measurement. The total serum Ca and calculated ionized Ca concentrations were sensitive (95 % and 89 %, respectively) but lacked specificity (32 % and 46 %, respectively) in predicting ionized hypocalcemia. Analyses of Ca binding to albumin in the serum of surgical ICU patients and normal subjects suggested {{that there is a}} circulating factor in critically ill patients that increases the binding of Ca to albumin. These observations may explain why the McLean-Hastings nomogram underestimates the protein-induced changes in serum Ca in critically ill <b>surgical</b> <b>subjects.</b> We conclude that: total serum Ca and calculated ionized Ca concentrations are poor indicators of the true serum ionized Ca status in critically ill surgical patients, and we recommend direct measurement of serum ionized Ca levels in these patients; and variability in the affinity of Ca for binding proteins in critical illness may explain the poor correlation between serum total and ionized Ca measurements...|$|R

Patients with severe deformities can be treated by silicone metacarpophalangeal joint arthroplasty (SMPA). The objective {{of the study is}} to prospectively compare long‐term outcomes for an SMPA surgical and a nonsurgical cohort of RA patients. Methods A total of 67 surgical and 95 nonsurgical patients with severe subluxation and/or ulnar drift of the fingers at the MCP joints were recruited from 2004 – 2008 in this multicenter prospective cohort study. Patients could elect to undergo SMPA or not. Outcomes included the Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (MHQ), Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales 2 (AIMS 2), grip/pinch strength, Jebsen‐Taylor Test, ulnar deviation, extensor lag, and arc of motion measurements at the MCP joints. Results There {{was no significant difference in}} the mean age, race, education, and income at baseline between the 2 groups. <b>Surgical</b> <b>subjects</b> had worse MHQ function and functional measurements at baseline.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveCam-type femoroacetabular {{impingement}} (FAI) deformities {{have been}} associated with early osteoarthritic degeneration of the hip. Degeneration depends on many factors such as joint morphology and dynamics of motion. Bone mineral density (BMD) appears to be a manifestation of the above, and may be a potentiator. Thus the goal {{of this study was to}} assess subchondral BMD of cam deformities in symptomatic and asymptomatic FAI subjects, and to compare to normal controls. MethodsSubjects undergoing surgical correction of a symptomatic cam-type deformity were recruited (“Surgical”). Asymptomatic volunteers were also recruited and classified as normal (“Control”) or having a deformity (“Bump”) based on their alpha angle measurement. All subjects (n =  12 per group) underwent computed tomography (CT) with a calibration phantom. BMD was determined in volumes of interest around the femoral head and neck to a depth of 5  mm. BMD was compared between groups in each section using spine BMD as a covariate. ResultsNo differences were seen between groups in the peripheral bearing surface. The Bump group exhibited higher BMD than Controls within the head/neck junction (P <  0. 05). When compared to normal subchondral bone in the peripheral level of Controls, BMD in the deformity was up to 78 % higher in Bump subjects and up to 47 % higher in <b>Surgical</b> <b>subjects</b> (P <  0. 05). ConclusionSubchondral BMD of cam deformities is higher than that of normal subchondral bone in the peripheral region of the femoral head, regardless of symptom status.

Diurnal and inter-day variation was evaluated in the non-surgical OA group over 3 separate visits. Serum and urine samples were collected on two visits for the OA-TKR group with SF taken only {{at the time of}} surgery. ARGS neoepitope was quantitated using an optimized immunoassay. ResultsSerum ARGS neoepitope concentrations were elevated in OA-TKR subjects compared to non-surgical OA subjects (P =  0. 005) and healthy subjects (P =  0. 0002). Creatinine corrected urinary ARGS neoepitope concentrations were more variable, but were also elevated in the OA-TKR subjects compared to healthy subjects (P =  0. 008). No significant diurnal effect or inter-day variance was observed in serum or urine. Serum ARGS neoepitope concentrations correlated with age (P =  0. 0252) but not with total number of joints with OA involvement. SF ARGS neoepitope concentrations correlated with Western Ontario and MacMaster OA Index (WOMAC) stiffness score (P =  0. 04) whereas a weaker, non-significant trend towards positive correlation with combined WOMAC score and the number of concurrent joints was observed. ConclusionsThis study utilized a sensitive and robust assay to evaluate ARGS neoepitope {{concentrations in}} various matrices in OA patients and healthy volunteers.

Objectives: To determine the feasibility of dosing Haemate P-(R) VWF/factor VIII (FVIII) concentrate based on pharmacokinetics (PK) {{in the management of}} <b>surgical</b> <b>subjects</b> with VWD. Methods: VWD subjects scheduled for elective surgery were enrolled in a prospective multicenter open-label cohort study. A pre-operative loading dose of VWF/FVIII concentrate based upon prior individual subject PK analysis was administered followed by postoperative therapeutic/maintenance infusions. Results: Twenty-eight subjects with types 1, 2 A or 3 VWD and one with type 2 M were enrolled. Median in vivo recovery of VWF ristocetin cofactor (VWF:RCo) was 1. 9 IU dL(- 1) (IU kg(- 1)) (- 1) with an interquartile range (IQR) of 1. 6 - 2. 5 IU dL(- 1) (IU kg(- 1)) (- 1). Median response, half-life and clearance were 74. 0 % (IQR, 55. 5 - 100 %), 15. 6 h (IQR, 9. 0 - 28. 4 h) and 3. 26 mL kg(- 1) h(- 1) (IQR, 2. 29 - 5. 21 mL kg(- 1) h(- 1)), respectively. A PK-guided median VWF:RCo loading dose of 62. 4 IU kg(- 1) (IQR, 50. 1 - 87. 0 IU kg(- 1)) was administered. Postoperative mean trough VWF:RCo levels of 62 - 73 IU dL(- 1) were sufficient to prevent bleeding. Investigators rated hemostasis excellent or good in 96. 3 % of subjects on the day of surgery and 100 % on the next day and on day 14.
