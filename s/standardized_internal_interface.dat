The SAM Fed evolved from a legacy constructive real time/post mission hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) simulation. The process to transition from a standalone simulation to a distributed HLA federation as well as the problems experienced and lessons learned will be presented.

40|$|International audienceCommonly, {{software}} {{systems have}} public (and stable) <b>interfaces,</b> and <b>internal</b> (and possibly unstable) interfaces. Despite being discouraged, client developers often use <b>internal</b> <b>interfaces,</b> which may cause their systems to fail when they evolve. To overcome this problem, API producers may promote <b>internal</b> <b>interfaces</b> to public. In practice, however, API producers have no assistance to identify public interface candidates. In this paper, we study {{the transition from}} <b>internal</b> to public <b>interfaces.</b> We aim to help API producers to deliver a better product and API clients to benefit sooner from public interfaces. Our empirical investigation on five widely adopted Java systems present the following observations. First, we identified 195 promotions from 2, 722 <b>internal</b> <b>interfaces.</b> Second, we found that promoted <b>internal</b> <b>interfaces</b> have more clients. Third, we predicted <b>internal</b> <b>interface</b> promotion with precision between 50 %- 80 %, recall 26 %- 82 %, and AUC 74 %- 85 %. Finally, by applying our predictor on the last version of the analyzed systems, we automatically detected 382 public interface candidates...|$|R

40|$|In this dissertation, {{the studies}} aim to {{characterize}} the electronic structure at the <b>internal</b> <b>interface</b> of hybrid materials. The characterization challenge is originating from the spectral superposition of hybrid constituents. A characterization protocol based on photoemission spectroscopy (PES) was developed and applied to investigate the orbital alignment at the <b>internal</b> <b>interface</b> of the oligothiophene-TiO 2 and ArS-CdSe hybrid materials by characterizing the individual constituents and the assembly hybrids respectively. Electrospray deposition technique was used to deposit targeting materials which enabled preparation of thin films in vacuum minimizing ambient contaminations while transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to investigate the morphology and the particle size of the pure nanoparticles and the hybrids. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy was also used in the estimation of the optical band gap of the pure nanoparticles and the HOMO-LUMO gap of the organic ligands. One of the hybrid materials studied in this dissertation is oligothiophene-TiO 2 nanoparticle hybrids in which the oligothiophene ligands are bonded {{to the surface of}} TiO 2 nanoparticles covalently. This hybrid system was used to develop and demonstrate a measurement protocol {{to characterize the}} orbital alignment at the <b>internal</b> <b>interface.</b> Low intensity X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (LIXPS) was used to determine the work function of the oligothiophene ligands and the TiO 2 nanoparticles. In combination with the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) cutoff and the valence band maximum (VBM) measured by ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS), the ionization energies (IE) of these two constituents were determined. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) was used to characterize the core level emissions of the constituents and the hybrid assembly, which were used to determine the charge injection barriers at the <b>internal</b> <b>interface.</b> The results showed that there was an interface dipole at the <b>internal</b> <b>interface</b> between organic and inorganic constituents of the hybrid. The dipole was determined to be 0. 61 eV and the hole injection barrier at the <b>internal</b> <b>interface</b> amounted to 0. 73 eV. The electron injection barrier was estimated by taking into account the gap between highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO, LUMO). The procedure followed only suggested the presence of an insignificant barrier in the oligothiophene-TiO 2 nanoparticle hybrids. Arylthiol functionalized Cadmium Selenide (ArS-CdSe) is a novel hybrid material which can be used in hetero-junction solar cells. The ArSH ligands are bonded {{on the surface of the}} CdSe nanoparticles covalently through sulfur atoms serving as anchors. The <b>internal</b> <b>interface</b> in the ArS-CdSe hybrids between the organic constituent and the inorganic constituent was studied by the same characterization protocol developed in this dissertation. Furthermore, a physisorbed interface between the ArSH ligands and the CdSe nanoparticles was created through multi-step in-vacuum deposition procedure. The electrospray deposition technique enabled the formation of a well-defined physisorbed interface which was characterized by LIXPS, UPS and XPS for each deposition step. Accordingly, the orbital alignment at the physisorbed interface was determined. Based on the results obtained, detailed orbital alignments at the ArSH/CdSe physisorbed <b>interface</b> and the <b>internal</b> <b>interface</b> in the ArS-CdSe hybrid materials were delineated and discussed. The hole injection and electron injection barrier at the physisorbed ArSH/CdSe interface are 0. 7 eV and 1. 0 eV respectively. An interface dipole of 0. 4 eV was observed at the interface. In the ArS-CdSe hybrid materials, the electronic system of the ArSH component shifts down due to the charge transfer induced by the covalent hybridization. The hybridization also shifts the electronic system of the CdSe constituent to a lower energy level due to saturation of the unoccupied bonds of the Cd atoms on the surface. The hole injection barrier and electron injection barrier were determined to be 0. 5 eV and 1. 2 eV respectively. A small interface dipole (0. 2 eV) was observed at the <b>internal</b> <b>interface</b> as a result of the presence of covalent bonds...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Although <b>internal</b> <b>interfaces</b> {{have long}} been known to {{dominate}} the performance of many materials systems critical to modern technology, there has yet been little incontrovertible evidence pointing to the fundamental origin of the structure-property relationships. However, the recent development of direct imaging and analysis techniques in the {{scanning transmission electron microscope}} (STEM) has provided a new experimental pathway to obtain information on the local atomic structure, chemical composition and bonding at interfaces on the fundamental atomic scale. This is precisely the information that is required to unravel the complexities of interfaces and opens up a new paradigm for investigating the structure-property relationships at <b>internal</b> <b>interfaces.</b> In this paper we discuss the practical aspects of the experimental STEM techniques and demonstrate the resolution possible in current commercially available instrumentation. The application of these techniques to the study of <b>internal</b> <b>interfaces</b> is highlighted by a discussion of the analysis of homophase interfaces in SrTiO 3, Bi 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10 and YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -δ and the heterophase interfaces between GaAs and Au, and between Si and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) grown II-VI semiconductors...|$|R

This may expose the <b>internal</b> <b>interfaces</b> and objects within a location to attacks by mobile code. In this work, we propose an extension of notations based on the Higher-Order -calculus with a primitive operator whose role is to protect <b>internal</b> <b>interfaces</b> by dynamically restricting the visibility of channels. The usefulness of these operators is illustrated by applications involving resource access control. We show how restrictions on the behaviour of processes based on the notion of process type [16], and intended to be checked statically, can be enforced dynamically with the aid of the filter operator...|$|R
