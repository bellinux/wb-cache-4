40|$|In 1995, the WHO Regional Office for Africa {{launched}} a logistics project {{to address the}} four main areas of immunization logistics: the cold chain, transport, vaccine supply and quality, {{and the safety of}} injections in the countries of the region. The impact of this logistic approach on immunization injection safety was evaluated through surveys of injection procedures and an analysis of the injection materials (e. g. sterilizable or disposable syringes) chosen by the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) and those actually seen to be used. Re-use of injection materials without sterilization, accidental needle-stick injuries among health care workers, and injection-related abscesses in patients were common in countries in the WHO African Region. Few health centres used time-steam saturation-temperature (TST) indicators to check the quality of sterilization and, in many centres, the injection equipment was boiled instead of being <b>steam</b> <b>sterilized.</b> Facilities for the proper disposal of used materials were rarely present. Although the official EPI choice was to use sterilizable equipment, use of a combination of sterilizable and disposable equipment was observed in the field. Unsafe injection practices in these countries were generally due to a failure to integrate nursing practices and public awareness with injection safety issues, and an absence of the influence of EPI managers on health care service delivery.

40|$|Biological {{control of}} {{aflatoxin}} producing fungi must function within a complex crop production system that includes management schemes directed at diverse pests. One biological control of aflatoxin producers involves applying {{a strain of}} Aspergillus flavus that does not produce aflatoxins (atoxigenic strain) on a sterile food source (e. g. sorghum, wheat or barley seed) to field soils. The current study used the atoxigenic strain Aspergillus flavus AF 36 formulated on <b>steam</b> <b>sterilized</b> wheat seeds (AF 36 product). AF 36 is the atoxigenic strain used commercially to limit contamination of cottonseed in Arizona and Texas. Proper timing of applications allows this atoxigenic strain to grow, sporulate and disperse to other organic matter associated with the developing crop in time to competitively exclude aflatoxin producers. Competitive exclusion of aflatoxin producers from the crop results in decreased aflatoxin contamination. Atoxigenic strain applications are frequently made to fields where chemical methods are used to limit weed growth. Interactions between herbicides and AF 36 have not previously been investigated.

Outbreaks of SDS have been reported by farmers following applications of Roundup weather MAX (potassium salt of glyphosate 48. 8 %) at rates higher than recommended. The rate of glyphosate applications have been increasing since the introduction of |Roundup Ready (RR) soybeans in 1996. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) data shows that the commercial application rate of Roundup was 9. 12 fl oz (0. 57 lb active ingredient) per acre in 1996 and in 2006 this was increased to 19. 68 fl oz (1. 23 lb a. i) per acre. One {{of the reasons for}} higher application rates and increased glyphosate application frequency by the growers was to manage glyphosate resistant weeds and the availability of cheaper generic glyphosates. Trials were carried out under greenhouse conditions to understand (a) the effect of glyphosate spray frequency and the varietal reaction to glyphosate sprays at 22 fl oz per acre, and (b) the effect of application rates at 16, 22 and 33 fl oz per acre on SDS incidence and severity.

Spider silk exceeds the mechanical properties of silkworm silk. In this research silkworm mechanical and biochemical test analyzed {{the differences between the}} different silk fibres. To establish the biomedical possibilities, the cytotoxicity of the fibres was tested by culturing cells attached to the fibres for several weeks. Next to the cytotoxicity, the biocompatibility is a necessity before a material can be used as an implant material. In vivo studies were performed by implanting <b>steam</b> <b>sterilized</b> spider silk fibres subcutaneous in white Whistar rats. The acute reaction showing lots of ganulocytes by histological examination could be diminished significantly by cleaning the fiber-surface with enzymes. Also the fibrotic formation around the implant was comparable to the widely accepted polyglactin material that was brought under the skin heterolateral to the silk fibres. Mechanical tests showed that trypsin could be used in contrast to proteinase K. Cocoon silk, spider dragline and egg sac silk were used as fibres and as proteinic polymers to create porous 3 D scaffolds for cartilage regeneration. Human chondrocytes were seeded on it and cultured for several weeks to establish the scaffolds are not cytotoxic and cells can migrate, attach, grow and express their ECM in the pores of the spider silk matrix. Immunohistochemistry showed that the seeded chondrocytes expressed collagen II an aggrecan up to 6 weeks, which are typical for cartilage extracellular matrix. In a lesser extent there was also collagen I, showing some cells dedifferentiated in the material. Creating scaffolds with different pore-sizes and porosity, it was described that this influenced the mechanical properties of the construct. Bigger pore-sizes have a better interconnectivity, which improves the migration of the cells after seeding, but smaller pores give the cells a better surrounding, which chondrocytes need to maintain their differentiation and to express their extracellular matrix. Adding the mechanical stimulation and growth factors these scaffolds can be used for cartilage regeneration. Silk scaffolds could be reinforced with silk yarns to use them for tendon or ligament regeneration and as the shape can be adjusted other applications as meniscus regeneration also belong to the possibilities...|$|R

Aflatoxin levels were also significantly reduced when Lactobacillus species were inoculated into a growing mold culture, and also when mold spores were injected into Lactobacillus cultures. Different Lactobacillus isolates were purified from the silage inoculant mixture. Some of the isolates {{had no effect on}} mold growth and aflatoxin production. Other Lactobacillus isolates showed various degrees of aflatoxin inhibition. Lactobacillus isolate 371, which was identified as Lactobacillus casei pseudoplantarum, was found to greatly inhibit the production of aflatoxins B 1 and G 1. The inhibition of aflatoxins by Lactobacillus casei pseudoplantarum 371 was not eliminated by replacing an amount of glucose equal to the amount used by Lactobacillus sp before inoculation of the mold. The inhibitory principle in a Lactobacillus cell free supernatant was found to be sensitive to trypsin and α-chymotrypsin, but not to pepsin. Dialyzed protein concentrate of the Lactobacillus cell free supernatant greatly inhibited aflatoxin formation. The antiaflatoxigenic activity of the supernatant was destroyed at 100 C within 10 mn. While Lactobacillus casei pseudoplantarum 371 inhibited aflatoxin production in broth, it did not have any effect on mold growth and aflatoxin production in <b>sterile</b> <b>steamed</b> rice, when mold growth was monitored by ergosterol and plate count techniques. Ergosterol determination was found to be a sensitive indicator of low levels of fungal activity and aflatoxin production in rice. Ergosterol formation in rice followed the same trend as aflatoxin B 1 production. The inhibitory activity of the Lactobacillus isolate was shown to inactivate the enzymatic system required for the production of aflatoxin B 1. ...|$|R

Methods: Seven patients were treated with transurethral intraprostatic injections of <b>sterile</b> <b>steam</b> under endoscopic visualization followed by previously scheduled adenectomies. The extirpated adenomas were grossly examined followed by whole mount sectioning and staining with triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride (TTC) to evaluate thermal ablation. Histology was performed after hematoxylin and eosin staining on one prostate. After review of results from the first patient cohort, an additional 15 patients with clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia were treated followed by gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at one week. Results: In the first patient cohort, gross examination of TTC-stained tissue showed thermal ablation in the transition zone. In addition, there was a distinct interface between viable and necrotic prostatic parenchyma. Histopathologic examination revealed TTC staining-outlined necrotic versus viable tissue. Gadolinium-enhanced MRIs in the cohort of 15 patients demonstrated lesion defects in all patients at 1 week post-procedure. Coalesced lesions were noted with a mean (± standard deviation) lesion volume of 9. 6 ± 8. 5 cm 3. The largest lesion volume was 35. 1 cm 3. Ablation using vapor was rapid and remained confined to the transition zone, consistent with the thermodynamic principles of convective thermal energy transfer. Conclusion: Thermal ablation was observed in all specimens. The resulting coalescing ablative lesions, as seen on MRI, were confined to the transition zone. These studies confirm the ablative capabilities of vapor, validate the thermodynamic principles of convective heating, and allow for further clinical studies.

5000|$|Lister {{continued}} to develop improved methods of antisepsis and asepsis when he realised that infection {{could be better}} avoided by preventing bacteria from getting into wounds in the first place. This led {{to the rise of}} sterile surgery. Lister introduced the <b>Steam</b> Steriliser to <b>sterilize</b> equipment, instituted rigorous hand washing and later implemented the wearing of rubber gloves. These three crucial advances [...] - [...] the adoption of a scientific methodology toward surgical operations, the use of anaesthetic and the introduction of sterilised equipment [...] - [...] laid the groundwork for the modern invasive surgical techniques of today.|$|R
30|$|The fasted {{control and}} PN rats were {{allocated}} to two groups (n =  4 /group) {{based on the}} administration route: intravenous and intraduodenal VCM administration. In the intravenous administration study, rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50  mg/kg), and the VCM saline solution (2.5  mg/mL) was bolus injected into the left femoral vein (5  mg/kg). Blood samples were taken 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, and 360  min after administration, and were centrifuged at 12, 000  rpm for 15  min to collect the plasma fraction. In the intraduodenal administration study, the abdominal cavity was opened in anesthetized rats and the stomach was exposed. A small incision was made on the lesser curvature of the stomach, and the VCM saline solution (10  mg/mL) was administered through the incision and the pylorus into the duodenum (20  mg/kg) using a <b>sterilized</b> oral <b>feeding</b> needle. After administration, the incision was closed with a tissue adhesive and the pylorus was ligated. Blood samples were taken 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360  min after administration, and plasma samples were collected by centrifugation. The collected plasma samples in both studies were immediately frozen at − 80  °C until analysis.|$|R
40|$|Using blotter, agar {{plate and}} deep-freezing method as {{recommended}} by ISTA, the seed borne mycoflora of 24 samples of tomato seeds collected from vegetable markets of different parts of Pakistan was examined. Agar plate method yielded greater number of fungi followed by blotter and deep-freezing method. Of the 20 genera and 37 species of fungi viz., Alternaria alternate, A. tenuissima, Aspergillus candidus, A. flavus, A. fumigatus, A. niger, A. quadrilineatus, A. flavus, A. niger, A. quadrilineatus, A. sulphureus, A. terreus, A. wentii. Aspergillus sp., Auriobasidium pullulans, Cephaliophora irregularis, Chaetomium globosum, C. indicum, Cladosporium sp., Curvu-laria lunata, C. tubereulata, Drechslera australiensis, D. hawaiiensis, D. state of Cochliobolus specifer, Fusarium moniliforme, F. oxysporum, F. semitectum, F. solani, Mucor sp., Macrophomina phaseolina, Nigrospora oryzae, Penicillium sp., Paecilomyces variotii, P. lilacinus, Phoma sp., Rhizopus sp., Scopulariopsis sp., Stachybotrys atra, Syncephalastrum sp., and Trichoderma harzianum, atleast 21 species of fungi marked with an asterisk are new reports from tomato seed. Fusarium moniliforme, F. solani, F. oxysporum, A. alternate, D. australiensis, A. flavus and A. niger were found predominant. Surface sterilization of seeds showed greater incidence of Chaetomium spp., fusarium oxysporum, F. solani, A. flavus and A. alternate with reduction in infection by A. niger A. terreus, A. wentii, D. australiensis, Penicillium sp., and Rhizopus sp. Where naturally infected seed were sown in <b>steam</b> <b>sterilized</b> soil, C. globisum, F. solani, S. atra, C. herbarum and C. Iunata showed pre-and post emergenece infection of seedling, indicating their seed-borne nature. In pathogenicity test seed inoculation and soil infestation with conidia of F. moniliforme, F. oxysporum and A. alternate reduced seed germination and produced wilting with greater incidence where an increase in inoculum level of the pathogen was used. No fruiting was observed where naturally infected seeds were artificially inoculated with F. oxysporum and sown in sterilized soil. Infection by F. oxysporum was also detected from root, stem leaf and flower parts. Soil infested with both Meloidogyne javanica root knot nematode and F. oxysporum showed an increase in gall formatlion only where the population of M. javanica was 2000 eggs/pot and F. oxysporum was 10 cfu/pot, but at high nematode or F. oxysporum population seedling mortality was produced. Paecilomyces lilacinus reduced the infection of M. javanica and F. oxysporum but efficacy of P. lilacinus declined {{with an increase in}} inoculum level of the pathogens. Seed treatment with Captan or Benlate @ 2 g a. i. /kg seed showed significant control of F. oxysporum infection in 60 days old tomato plants in both naturally and artificially infected seeds. Seed dressing with microbial antagonists viz., Paecilomyces lilacinus, Trichoderma harzianum and Rhizobium meliloti also reduced the seed-borne infection of F. oxysporum with better results found in R. meliloti treatment where significant increase in plant height and fresh weight was observe...|$|R
