5|$|Although space vector {{pulse-width}} modulation (SVPWM) {{is becoming}} increasingly popular, <b>sinusoidal</b> PWM (SPWM) is the most straightforward method used to vary drives' motor voltage (or current) and frequency. With SPWM control (see Fig. 1), quasi-sinusoidal, variable-pulse-width output is constructed from intersections of a saw-toothed carrier signal with a modulating <b>sinusoidal</b> signal which is variable in operating frequency {{as well as in}} voltage (or current).|$|E
5|$|A numerically {{controlled}} oscillator (NCO) is a digital signal generator which creates a synchronous (i.e. clocked), discrete-time, discrete-valued {{representation of a}} waveform, usually <b>sinusoidal.</b> NCOs are often {{used in conjunction with}} a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) at the output to create a direct digital synthesizer (DDS).|$|E
5|$|Between 1973 and 1978, {{together}} with Dutch researcher Stan Tempelaars (1938–2010), Kaegi developed the VOSIM program. VOSIM, {{which stands for}} VOice SIMulator, is a system based on the digital sound synthesis of simple, <b>sinusoidal</b> square waves, allowing the modeling of vowel sounds, vocal fricatives and quasi-instrumental tones. It complemented, and was used in conjunction with, Gottfried Michael Koenig's own computer-generated music programs Project 1 (1964), Project 2 (1966) and SSP (1971). Werner Kaegi summed up the VOSIM system in 1986 in a presentation for the scientific journal Interface.|$|E
5|$|The {{explanation}} of this instability {{begins with the}} existence of tiny perturbations in the stream. These are always present, no matter how smooth the stream is. If the perturbations are resolved into <b>sinusoidal</b> components, we find that some components grow with time while others decay with time. Among those that grow with time, some grow at faster rates than others. Whether a component decays or grows, and how fast it grows is entirely a function of its wave number (a measure of how many peaks and troughs per centimeter) and the radii of the original cylindrical stream.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to replace the standard diode-bridge rectifier with a bi-directional IGBT switching device bridge mirroring the standard inverter which uses IGBT switching device output to the motor. Such rectifiers are referred to by various designations including active infeed converter (AIC), active rectifier, IGBT supply unit (ISU), active front end (AFE), or four-quadrant operation. With PWM control and a suitable input reactor, an AFE's AC line current waveform can be nearly <b>sinusoidal.</b> AFE inherently regenerates energy in four-quadrant mode from the DC side to the AC grid. Thus, no braking resistor is needed, and {{the efficiency of the}} drive is improved if the drive is frequently required to brake the motor.|$|E
25|$|Whereas {{induction}} and {{synchronous motor}} drives are typically with either six-step or <b>sinusoidal</b> waveform output, BLDC motor drives are usually with trapezoidal current waveform; {{the behavior of}} both <b>sinusoidal</b> and trapezoidal PM machines is however identical {{in terms of their}} fundamental aspects.|$|E
25|$|In both cases, for an applied <b>sinusoidal</b> voltage, the {{resulting}} current is also <b>sinusoidal,</b> but in quadrature, 90 degrees {{out of phase}} with the voltage. However, the phases have opposite signs: in an inductor, the current is lagging; in a capacitor the current is leading.|$|E
25|$|When {{confronted by}} a {{periodically}} varying function, the standard approach is to employ Fourier series, a form of analysis that uses <b>sinusoidal</b> functions as a basis set, having frequencies that are zero, one, two, three, etc. times the frequency of a particular fundamental cycle. These multiples are called harmonics of the fundamental frequency, and the process is termed harmonic analysis. If the basis set of <b>sinusoidal</b> functions suit the behaviour being modelled, relatively few harmonic terms need to be added. Orbital paths are very nearly circular, so <b>sinusoidal</b> variations are suitable for tides.|$|E
25|$|With <b>sinusoidal</b> time {{dependence}} on all quantities, i.e.|$|E
25|$|A purely {{reactive}} {{component is}} distinguished by the <b>sinusoidal</b> voltage across the component being in quadrature with the <b>sinusoidal</b> current through the component. This {{implies that the}} component alternately absorbs energy from the circuit and then returns energy to the circuit. A pure reactance will not dissipate any power.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sinusoidal</b> {{systems of}} house {{division}} {{are similar to}} Porphyry houses except that instead of each quadrant being divided into three equal sized houses, the middle house in each quadrant is compressed or expanded based on whether the quadrant covers less than or greater than 90 degrees. In other words, houses are smooth around the zodiac with the difference or ratio in quadrant sizes being spread in a continuous <b>sinusoidal</b> manner from expanded to compressed houses. <b>Sinusoidal</b> houses were invented and first published by Walter Pullen in his astrology program Astrolog in 1994.|$|E
25|$|Condition for {{application}} of Carson's rule is only <b>sinusoidal</b> signals.|$|E
25|$|Additive {{synthesis}} can {{be implemented}} using a bank of <b>sinusoidal</b> oscillators, one for each partial.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{seasonality}} may {{be incorporated}} by allowing {{time of year}} to influence transmission rate in a stepwise or <b>sinusoidal</b> fashion.|$|E
25|$|An average {{responding}} multimeter will only meet its specified accuracy on AC volts and amps for purely <b>sinusoidal</b> waveforms.|$|E
25|$|Using Fourier analysis, wave packets can be {{analyzed}} into infinite sums (or integrals) of <b>sinusoidal</b> waves of different wavenumbers or wavelengths.|$|E
25|$|Waves {{that are}} <b>sinusoidal</b> in time but {{propagate}} through a medium whose properties vary with position (an inhomogeneous medium) may propagate at a velocity that varies with position, {{and as a}} result may not be <b>sinusoidal</b> in space. The figure at right shows an example. As the wave slows down, the wavelength gets shorter and the amplitude increases; after a place of maximum response, the short wavelength is associated with a high loss and the wave dies out.|$|E
25|$|The term {{wavelength}} is {{also sometimes}} applied to modulated waves, {{and to the}} <b>sinusoidal</b> envelopes of modulated waves or waves formed by interference of several sinusoids.|$|E
25|$|This {{definition}} is useful because {{it applies to}} all waveforms, whether they are <b>sinusoidal</b> or not. This is particularly useful in power electronics, where nonsinusoidal waveforms are common.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that the}} induced EMF method is {{dependent}} on the assumption of a <b>sinusoidal</b> current distribution, delivering an accuracy better than about 10% as long as the wavelength to element diameter ratio is greater than about 60. However, for yet larger conductors numerical solutions are required which solve for the conductor's current distribution (rather than assuming a <b>sinusoidal</b> pattern). This can be based on approximating solutions for either Pocklington's integrodifferential equation or the Hallén integral equation. These approaches also have greater generality, not being limited to linear conductors.|$|E
25|$|Assuming a <b>sinusoidal</b> wave {{moving at}} a fixed wave speed, {{wavelength}} is inversely proportional to frequency of the wave: waves with higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths, and lower frequencies have longer wavelengths.|$|E
25|$|Vibrational therapy {{by way of}} <b>sinusoidal</b> (high-frequency oscillating) {{electric}} current was discovered by Kellogg in 1884 to have medical use for increasing blood circulation and passive exercise. In particular, Kellogg invented a vibrating chair used to stimulate vital organs in the lower abdomen. Even today one can visit the Kellogg Discovery Center in Battle Creek, Michigan, and sit on Kellogg's vibrating chair, which is equipped to mechanically oscillate 20 times per second. Furthermore, Kellogg devised an electrotherapy exercise bed in which a <b>sinusoidal</b> current that produced muscular contraction but no pain could be delivered for twenty minutes and reportedly achieve the stimulation of a brisk four-mile walk.|$|E
25|$|The {{harmonic}} {{distribution of}} a sine wave carrier modulated {{by such a}} <b>sinusoidal</b> signal can be represented with Bessel functions; this provides {{the basis for a}} mathematical understanding of frequency modulation in the frequency domain.|$|E
25|$|Additive analysis/resynthesis {{has been}} {{employed}} {{in a number}} of techniques including <b>Sinusoidal</b> Modelling, Spectral Modelling Synthesis (SMS), and the Reassigned Bandwidth-Enhanced Additive Sound Model. Software that implements additive analysis/resynthesis includes: SPEAR, LEMUR, LORIS, SMSTools, ARSS.|$|E
25|$|Another way {{to reduce}} {{friction}} between two parts is to superimpose micro-scale vibration {{to one of the}} parts. This can be <b>sinusoidal</b> vibration as used in ultrasound-assisted cutting or vibration noise, known as dither.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sinusoidal,</b> {{which was}} the first pseudocylindrical {{projection}} developed. On the map, as in reality, the length of each parallel is proportional to the cosine of the latitude. The area of any region is true.|$|E
25|$|He is the namesake of the guided-missile frigate Curts, whose crest {{contains}} a flaming bomb {{referring to his}} combat service in command of Columbia, flanked by <b>sinusoidal</b> waves intended to evoke his contributions {{to the development of}} radar.|$|E
25|$|IGFBP-3 mRNA is {{expressed}} in all tissue examined, with kidney, stomach, placenta, uterus and liver showing highest expression in rat tissues. Rat liver IGFBP-3 mRNA is found in nonparenchymal cells including <b>sinusoidal</b> endothelium, but not in hepatocytes. In contrast, human hepatocytes do express IGFBP-3.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} is {{the frequency}} {{at which the}} entire wave vibrates. Overtones are other <b>sinusoidal</b> components present at frequencies above the fundamental. All of the frequency components {{that make up the}} total waveform, including the fundamental and the overtones, are called partials. Together they form the harmonic series.|$|E
25|$|The {{ripple current}} is {{specified}} {{as an effective}} (RMS) value at 100 or 120Hz or at 10kHz at upper category temperature. Non-sinusoidal ripple currents have to be analyzed and separated into their single <b>sinusoidal</b> frequencies by means of Fourier analysis and summarized by squared addition of the single currents.|$|E
25|$|A phasor is {{represented}} by a constant complex number, usually expressed in exponential form, representing the complex amplitude (magnitude and phase) of a <b>sinusoidal</b> function of time. Phasors are used by electrical engineers to simplify computations involving sinusoids, where they can often reduce a differential equation problem to an algebraic one.|$|E
25|$|If a {{traveling}} wave has a fixed shape that repeats in space or in time, it is a periodic wave. Such waves are sometimes regarded {{as having a}} wavelength {{even though they are}} not <b>sinusoidal.</b> As shown in the figure, wavelength is measured between consecutive corresponding points on the waveform.|$|E
25|$|The {{stationary}} wave {{can be viewed}} as the sum of two traveling <b>sinusoidal</b> waves of oppositely directed velocities. Consequently, wavelength, period, and wave velocity are related just as for a traveling wave. For example, the speed of light can be determined from observation of standing waves in a metal box containing an ideal vacuum.|$|E
25|$|This entire cycle {{takes place}} very rapidly, the {{oscillations}} dying {{out in a}} time of the order of a millisecond. Each spark across the spark gap produces a pulse of damped <b>sinusoidal</b> high voltage at the output terminal of the coil. Each pulse dies out before the next spark occurs, so the coil generates a string of damped waves, not a continuous <b>sinusoidal</b> voltage. The high voltage from the supply transformer that charges the capacitor is a 50 or 60Hz sine wave. Depending on how the spark gap is set, usually one or two sparks occur at the peak of each half-cycle of the mains current, so {{there are more than a}} hundred sparks per second. Thus the spark at the spark gap appears continuous, as do the high voltage streamers from the top of the coil.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} types of {{vibration}} testing services conducted by vibration test labs are <b>Sinusoidal</b> and Random. Sine (one-frequency-at-a-time) tests are performed {{to survey the}} structural response of the device under test (DUT). A random (all frequencies at once) test is generally considered to more closely replicate a real world environment, such as road inputs to a moving automobile.|$|E
25|$|This whistle has {{dozens of}} popular names. Pipes with <b>sinusoidal</b> {{variations}} of radius are often created to permit bending. Steady {{flow through the}} pipe at low Reynolds numbers results in a fluctuating volumetric flow rate that generates a monopole-like sound field at the pipe exit. Examples of such pipes {{are shown in figure}} on the right.|$|E
