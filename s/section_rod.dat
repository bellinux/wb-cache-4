40|$|Purpose The femoral head {{expandable}} peg oVers a {{new concept}} of bone-device purchase treating proxi-mal femur fractures. We describe the expansion inXu-ence on both the periimplant bone properties and the intraosseous pressure. Methods A 10 £ 8 mm cannulated peg consisting of a stainless steel oval-shaped transversely <b>sectioned</b> <b>rod</b> was tested on 13 femoral heads retrieved from patients with subcapital fracture treated by hemiarthroplasty. Normal saline solution was used to expand the diame-ter of its membrane from 7. 8 to 10. 5 mm, resulting in abutment of the distal peg to the compacted cancellous bone of the femoral head. The intraosseous pressure was monitored using a 1. 4 mm drill-hole. Results Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and micro-radiography demonstrated increased periimplant bone density following peg expansion, without signiWcant increase in the intraosseous pressure. Conclusion The new implant aVorded improved peri-implant bone density, less trabecular damage and pres-ervation of bone stock, all contributing to reliable biomechanical support and potentially decreasing the high complication rate following screw Wxation in oste-oporotic femora.

5000|$|Bernard Redfern left The Carborundum Co., which officially wrote off all {{interests}} in the glassy carbon invention. While working at the Plessey Company laboratory (in a disused church) in Towcester, UK, Redfern received a glassy carbon crucible for duplication from UKAEA. He identified it as one he had made from markings he had engraved into the uncured precursor prior to carbonisation. (It {{is almost impossible to}} engrave the finished product.) The Plessey Company set up a laboratory first in a factory previously used to make briar pipes, in Litchborough, UK, and then a permanent facility at Caswell, near Blakesly, UK. Caswell became the Plessey Research Centre and then the Allen Clark Research Centre. Glassy carbon arrived at the Plessey Company Limited as a fait accompli. Redfern was assigned J.C. Lewis, as a laboratory assistant, for the production of glassy carbon. F.C. Cowlard was assigned to Redfern's department later, as a laboratory administrator. Cowlard was an administrator who previously had some association with Silane (Silane US Patent assignee 3,155,621 3 Nov 1964). Neither he nor Lewis had any previous connection with glassy carbon.The contribution of Bernard Redfern to the invention and production of glassy / Vitreous carbon is acknowledged by his co-authorship of early articles.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the bond strength of glass fiber posts to intraradicular dentin when cemented with self-etching and self-adhesive resin cements. Materials and Methods: Forty-eight single-rooted human teeth were decoronated, endodontically treated, post-space prepared and divided into 8 groups (n = 6). The glass fiber posts used were: Exacto (EA) (Angelus) and everStick (ES) (StichTeck), which were cemented with two self-adhesive resin cements: BisCem (BIS) (Bisco) and Rely-X Unicem (UNI) (3 M/ESPE), and two self-etching resin cements: Esthetic Cementing System NAC 100 (NAC) (Kuraray) and Panavia-F (PAN) (Kuraray).

Results: Means (and SD) of mu TBS (MPa) were: EA/PAN: 10. 3 (4. 1), EA/NAC: 14 (5. 1) EA/BIS: 16. 4 (4. 8), EA/UNI: 19. 8 (5. 1), ES/PAN: 25. 9 (6. 1), ES/NAC: 29. 1 (7), ES/BIS: 28. 9 (6), ES/UNI: 30. 5 (6. 6). ANOVA indicated significant differences among the groups (p 0. 05). mu TBS values obtained with ES post were significantly higher than those obtained with EA post irrespective of the resin cement used.
