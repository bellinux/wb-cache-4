40|$|While human {{tinkering}} with the zoogeographical distribution of lower animals sometimes pays dividends, more often it opens up Pandora 2 ̆ 7 s box. Such {{is the case of}} the Weaver Finch family. This group of birds is characterized by its colonial habits, granivorous appetite which often counters man 2 ̆ 7 s best interests, and elaborate nest structures. The House Sparrow (passer domesticus) is a notable exception of the latter trait as its nests look like a Picasso interpretation of an Afro wig. Weaver Finches originated in Africa. Here they are found in their most numerous forms. The Quelea quelea in flocks of several million compete seriously with human food supplies. They are the prime avian pests on that continent. Despite this background, some Weaver Finches have been intentionally transplanted {{to other parts of the}} world including the Caribbean Islands by thoughtless humans (Bond, 1971; Wetmore and Swales, 1931). The House Sparrow is found on Grand Bahama, Cuba and Jamaica; the Hooded Weaver Finch (<b>spermestes</b> <b>cucullatus)</b> and the Orange-cheeked Weaver Finch (Estrilda melpoda) are confined to Puerto Rico; and the Village Weaver (Textor [ploceus]cucullatus) : is found only on the island of Hispaniola. This paper considers the problem of the latter species...|$|E

However {{little is known about}} the information contained in these vocalizations. This study investigated the warning vocalisations of three passerine species, viz. the Buff-streaked Chat Oenanthe bifasciata, the Stonechat Saxicola torquata and the Bronze Mannikin <b>Spermestes</b> <b>cucullatus.</b> The study investigated whether the alarm calls for terrestrial predators differ in their acoustic structure from alarm calls emitted for aerial predators. Birds were exposed to latex terrestrial snakes and mounted aerial raptors, while changes in six acoustic parameters of alarm calls were measured. Bronze Mannikins were investigated for differences in intra-specific alarm calls between familiar and unfamiliar group members by capturing wild groups of mannikins and randomly mixing these to form assorted groups. Bronze Mannikins emitting warning calls were able to discriminate differences in predator size, and increased their calling rate and decreased the end frequency of the alarm call in response to larger predators. This may be the caller’s response to increased threat or variation in frequency may obscure cues to the caller’s whereabouts. Assorted group members were less aggressive to predator models than original members and panicked more during confrontations. Hence the unfamiliarity of the caller may have disrupted group cohesion. The alarm call acoustics of the social Buff-streaked Chats and the solitary Stonechat were compared to examine the effect of group-living on alarm behaviour. Snakes elicited louder calls from both the chat species than raptors. Louder and collectively more vocal social groups might be more successful in discouraging attacks than an asocial species. Variation in amplitude and call frequencies by the Stonechat provided some evidence that they are equally adapted to identifying predator type. Although Buff-streaked Chats increased their call rate in response to nearby predator models, Stonechats produced shorter calls in response to terrestrial predation particularly when the predators were in close proximity. Knowledge gained through direct encounters with predators or the ease with which raptors and snakes can gain access to nests may have played a part in discrimination of predator threat. Overall this study indicated strong correlations between some alarm acoustic parameters and predator size as well as the degree of threat...|$|E
