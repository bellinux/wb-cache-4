Another version of the quote has Shankly saying, There's only two teams in Liverpool: Liverpool and Liverpool Reserves.|$|E

Allison, a new member of the Committee, was a talented {{experimental}} physicist and a protégé of Arthur Compton at the University of Chicago. Oliphant [...] "came to a meeting", Allison recalls, [...] "and said 'bomb' in no uncertain terms. He told us we must concentrate every effort on the bomb, and <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> no right to work on power plants or anything but the bomb. The bomb would cost 25 million dollars, he said, and Britain {{did not have the}} money or the manpower, so it was up to us." [...] Allison was surprised that Briggs had kept the committee in the dark. Oliphant visited his friend Ernest Lawrence, and also spoke with James Conant and Enrico Fermi. He not only managed to convince the Americans that an atomic bomb was feasible, but also inspired Lawrence to convert his [...] cyclotron into a giant mass spectrometer for isotope separation, a technique Oliphant had pioneered in 1934. Leo Szilard later wrote, [...] "if Congress knew the true history of the atomic energy project, I have no doubt but that it would create a special medal to be given to meddling foreigners for distinguished services, and that Dr Oliphant {{would be the first to}} receive one." ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "bomb {{them back}} to the stone age" [...] comment {{received}} significant publicity but LeMay disclaimed the comment, saying in a later interview: “I never said we should bomb {{them back to}} the Stone Age. I <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> the capability to do it".|$|E

2500|$|LeMay {{subsequently}} rejected misquotes of {{the famous}} [...] "Stone Age" [...] quote. [...] Later, in a Washington Post interview LeMay said that [...] "I never said we should bomb {{them back to the}} Stone Age. I <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> the capability to do it. I want to save lives on both sides". [...] Etymologyst Barry Popik cites multiple sources (including interviews with LeMay) for various versions of both quotes from LeMay Nevertheless, the [...] "should" [...] quote remained part of the LeMay legend, and remains widely attributed to him ever after.|$|E

2500|$|Oliphant {{met with}} the S-1 Section. Samuel K. Allison was a new {{committee}} member, a talented experimentalist and a protégé of Compton at the University of Chicago.

The bomb would cost 25 million dollars, he said, and Britain {{did not have the}} money or the manpower, so it was up to us." [...] Allison was surprised that Briggs had kept the committee in the dark. Oliphant then visited his friend Ernest Lawrence to explain the urgency. Lawrence contacted Compton and James B. Conant, who received the final MAUD Report from Thomson on 3 October 1941. Urey and Pegram were sent to the UK to obtain more information. In January 1942, the OSRD was empowered to engage in large engineering projects in addition to research. Without the help of the MAUD Committee the Manhattan Project would have started months behind. Instead they were able to begin thinking about how to create a bomb, not whether it was possible. Historian Margaret Gowing noted that [...] "events that change a time scale by only a few months can nevertheless change history." ...|$|E

2500|$|My {{studio is}} crammed with equipment, but I ended up feeling I was being {{overcome}} by it all—it {{was just too}} much. I {{used to go to}} bed every night thinking 'Tomorrow, I'm going to write the tune. Tomorrow {{is going to be the}} day', but nothing ever happened. Eventually Neil McLellan pointed out that we'd been in the studio for four months without having anything to show for it. [...] Nat [...] was doing her own record so we weren't spending a lot of time together , but [...] there were always dogs to stroke and videos to watch and gardens to walk 'round, so I didn't ever feel like I was at work—I was too laid-back. [...] Neil [...] <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to get out, get back to London. I knew I physically couldn't sit in my room any more, and for the first time in my life I listened to someone else and realised I actually needed help. It wasn't [...] that I needed help with the writing, just that I needed help finding the right headspace to get into the right frame of mind. I wanted to write a good album— one I was happy with—but to do that I knew I'd have to jerk myself out of [...] situation I was in and start again.|$|E
2500|$|After {{listening}} to the track [...] "Saxon" [...] performed by Nicki Minaj and production duo Chase & Status, Rihanna got {{in contact with the}} latter and wanted to collaborate. Chase & Status had a pair of sessions with Rihanna and worked together for a few weeks in an undisclosed location. The songs they worked on had a dubstep vibe, although Rihanna had some disagreements with the duo. In October 2009, she concluded recording sessions with Tricky Stewart and The-Dream. Dream and Tricky flew out to Paris and played a few songs for Rihanna which included [...] "Hard" [...] and [...] "Rockstar 101." [...] "Hard" [...] stood out from all the songs because she felt that it had such an arrogance in it. In the song [...] "Rockstar 101," [...] guitarist Slash contributed a bass guitar on the track while [...] "Photographs" [...] is a duet with singer-songwriter will.i.am. In addition, Ester Dean co-wrote the fourth single from the album, [...] "Rude Boy". [...] "The Last Song" [...] {{was one of the last}} tracks crafted for the album. Rihanna recorded the song within the final twelve hours of the album's conception; [...] "when the label finally <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> 12 hours to turn in the album, I was like, Okay, I have to do it. I just drank some red wine, dimmed the lights, got in the booth and sang it", she explained.|$|E
