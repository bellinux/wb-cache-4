A H∞ controller with friction compensation is designed for the <b>seat</b> <b>suspension</b> control system where the friction is estimated and compensated based on the measurement of seat acceleration. This principal aim of this research was to control the low frequency vibration transferred or amplified by the vehicle (chassis) suspension, and to maintain the passivity of the <b>seat</b> <b>suspension</b> at high frequency (isolation vibration) while taking into consideration the trade-off between the active <b>seat</b> <b>suspension</b> cost and its high frequency performance. Sinusoidal excitations of 1 - 4. 5 Hz were applied to test the active <b>seat</b> <b>suspension</b> both when controlled and when uncontrolled and this is compared with a well-tuned passive heavy duty vehicle <b>seat</b> <b>suspension.</b> The results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm within the tested frequencies.

40|$|Whole body {{vibration}} in operational vehicles {{can cause}} serious musculo-skeletal disorders among the exposed workers. Consequently, considerable {{efforts have been}} made to protect vehicle operators from potentially harmful vibration. This thesis was aimed at the development of a semi-active <b>suspension</b> <b>seat</b> equipped with a magneto-rheological (MR) fluid damper. A damper controller was synthesized to minimize the vibration transmitted to the seated body and the frequency of end-stop impacts, which is known to induce high intensity vibration or shock motions to the seated occupant. A <b>suspension</b> <b>seat</b> was modeled by considering the kinematic non-linearity due to the cross-linkages and the damper link, while the cushion characteristics were linearized about the operating preload. The force-velocity properties of the MR damper were modeled by piecewise polynomial functions of applied current {{on the basis of the}} laboratory-measured data. The kineto-dynamic model of the <b>suspension</b> <b>seat</b> was thoroughly validated using the laboratory-measured responses under harmonic excitations in the 0. 5 to 10 Hz range. The performance characteristics of the passive <b>suspension</b> <b>seat</b> model were evaluated under different vehicular excitations in terms of frequency-weighted rms acceleration, vibration dose value (VDV), seat effective amplitude transmissibility (SEAT) and VDV ratio. These performance characteristics are also evaluated under amplified vehicular excitations in order to investigate the frequency as well as the potential suppression of end-stop impacts. The controller synthesis was realized in two stages: (1) attenuation of continuous vibration; and (2) suppression of end-stop impacts. Two different algorithms were explored in the first stage synthesis, which included a sky-hook control algorithm and a relative states feedback control algorithm. Each algorithm was further utilized in two different control current modulations. The performance potentials of each control synthesis were investigated using the 2 MATLAB Simulink platform under harmonic, transient, and random vehicular excitations in terms of SEAT and VDV ratio. One controller design (overall best suited for implementations) was subsequently implemented in a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test platform coupled with a MR-fluid damper mounted on an electro-hydraulic actuator that was linked to the HIL simulation platform. The semi-active <b>suspension</b> <b>seat</b> performance characteristics were further evaluated under different excitations using the selected control scheme. The results showed that the selected control scheme yielded SEAT and VDV ratio reductions in the 5 to 30 % range depending upon the nature of excitations. The implementation of the second-stage controller, which was tested only by simulations, entirely eliminated the occurrence of end-stop impacts at nominal vibration level and attenuated the end-stop impact severity of three times amplified excitations by up to 10 %.

40|$|Many {{off-road}} {{machines are}} equipped with a <b>suspension</b> <b>seat</b> intended to minimize the vibration exposure of the operator to vertical vibration. The optimization of the isolation characteristics of a <b>suspension</b> <b>seat</b> involves consideration of the dynamic responses of the various components of the seat. Ideally, the seat components would be optimized using a numerical model of the seat. However, seat suspensions are complex with non-linear characteristics {{that are difficult to}} model; the development of seat suspensions is therefore currently more empirical than analytical. This paper presents and compares two alternative methods of modelling the non-linear dynamic behaviour of two suspension seats whose dynamic characteristics were measured in the laboratory. A ‘lumped parameter model’, which represented the dynamic responses of individual seat components, was compared with a global ‘Bouc–Wen model’ having a non-linear degree-of-freedom. Predictions of the vibration dose value for a load placed on the seats were compared with laboratory measurements. The normalized r. m. s. errors between the predictions and the measurements were also determined. The median absolute difference between the measured and predicted seat surface vibration dose values over all test conditions for both models was less than 6 % of the measured value (with an inter-quartile range less than 20 %). Both models were limited by deficiencies in the simulation of top end-stop impacts after the load lifted from the seat surface.

Complications may arise with the evaluation of the vibration profile when high acceleration events are present. These peaks could be the result of a genuine exposure to high impact events, such as driving over a pothole or when experiencing an end-stop impact. However, the event could also be the result of an alternative factor, such as the driver altering their posture on the seat and during ingress/egress: an ‘artefact’.

The primary thrusts of this investigation are: (1) {{the development of a}} simple model that captures the essential dynamics of a seated human exposed to vertical vibration, (2) the selection and evaluation of several standards for assessing human sensitivity to vertical vibration, and (3) the determination of the linear and nonlinear <b>seat</b> <b>suspension</b> parameters that yield optimal vibration isolation. For the linear <b>seat</b> <b>suspension,</b> results show that the optimal seat damping coefficient depends very much on the selection of the vibration sensitivity standard, on the lower bound of the stiffnesses used in the constrained optimization procedure, and on vibration environments. In all cases, however, the optimal seat damping obtained here is significantly larger (a factor of 2 to 10) than that obtained using existing <b>seat</b> <b>suspension</b> design methods or from previous optimal suspension studies. This research also indicates that the existing means of assessing vibration in suspension design (ISO 7096) requires modification.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2008. Suspension {{seats are}} {{commonly}} used for earth moving machinery to isolate vehicle operators from vibrations transmitted to the vehicle body. To provide the required stiffness and damping for these seats, air-springs are typically {{used in conjunction with}} dampers. However, to eliminate the need for additional dampers, air-springs can be used in conjunction with auxiliary air volumes to provide both spring stiffness and damping. The damping is introduced through the flow restriction connecting the two air volumes. In this study, simplified models of an air-spring were derived followed by a model including the addition of an auxiliary volume. Subsequent to simulations, tests were performed on an experimental apparatus to validate the models. The air-spring models were shown to predict the behaviour of the experimental apparatus. The air-spring and auxiliary volume model followed the trend predicted by literature but showed approximately 27 % lower transmissibility amplitude and 21 % lower system natural frequency than obtained by tests when using large flow restriction diameters. This inaccuracy was assumed to be introduced by the simplified mass transfer equations defining the flow restriction between air-spring and auxiliary volume. The models however showed correlation when the auxiliary volume size was decreased by two thirds of the volume actually used for the experiment. This design of a prototype air-spring and auxiliary volume is presented for a <b>suspension</b> <b>seat</b> used in articulated or rigid frame dump trucks.

40|$|From {{the point}} of view of {{suspension}} damper, semi-active dampers with only minimal power requirement could be applied to achieve variable damping to enhance suspension performance under complex vibration and shock environments. Magneto-rheological (MR) fluid based dampers offer significant potential for realizing semi-actively controlled variable damping with only minimal power. The MR-fluid dampers invariably exhibit considerable hysteresis, while the damping force varies with the intensity of applied electro-magnetic field and the nature of vibration in a highly nonlinear manner. A simulation model based on symmetric and asymmetric sigmoid functions is developed to fully characterize the properties of a MR-damper as function of excitation and control current. A comprehensive laboratory test program is undertaken to characterize the damping properties of a MR damper under wide ranges of excitations and control current. The essential fundamental features are identified for the modeling task, while the model parameters are identified using multi-parameter error minimization techniques. The validity of the proposed generic model is thoroughly examined by comparing the model response with the measured data under a wide range of excitations, particularly the force saturation and the hysteresis behaviour. An independent current function is further derived that could be integrated to reported regression-based hysteresis models to enhance their prediction abilities. From the results of the study, it is concluded that the refined Bouc-Wen and the proposed generalized sigmoid function model can fully characterized the nonlinear MR damping behaviour as function of applied current and excitation. A nonlinear analytical model of a pneumatic <b>suspension</b> <b>seat</b> including the motion limiting stops is developed for synthesis and analyses of the MR-damping control algorithms. The validity of the passive <b>suspension</b> <b>seat</b> model is thoroughly examined under various deterministic and random vibration excitations of varying intensities. The results suggest that attenuation of shock as well as vibration imposes difficulties design compromise of the passive damper. Owing to the strongly nonlinear properties of the suspension-seat and the MR-damper, such as hysteresis, saturation and end-stop impacts, a 'hi-lo' semi-active control algorithm is synthesized to realized modulation of the control current and thus the damping force following the skyhook control law. A continuous modulation function is further synthesized and integrated to ensure smooth transition between the 'hi' and 'lo' states. A relative position control is further introduced to limit the frequency and severity of shock motions caused by end-stop impacts. A set of performance measures is proposed to assess the characteristics of the semi-active and the resulting integrated controller under a wide range of excitations, including deterministic excitations of continuous and transient nature and random excitations of different vehicles. The potential performance benefits of the controller design are further investigated through a hardware-in-the-loop test and simulation program.
