However, Madsen was <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> the affair and found in a Stockholm archive a receipt for 20,000 Danish crowns given to her by the Gestapo two days after Flammen's death. Her involvement with the Gestapo leader Hoffmann, and her refusal {{to talk about the}} topic, were the main reasons for Madsen's conclusion.|$|E
25|$|English Egyptologist, Sir John Gardner Wilkinson visited Amarna {{twice in}} the 1820s and {{identified}} it as 'Alabastron', following the sometimes contradictory descriptions of Roman-era authors Pliny (On Stones) and Ptolemy (Geography), although he was not <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> the identification and suggested Kom el-Ahmar as an alternative location.|$|E

The dark afternoons, and the first December snow, seemed to him far livelier than the August sunshine; and that he might make himself the <b>surer</b> <b>about</b> the flight of the days that were carrying him homeward, he stuck twenty-one sticks deep {{in a corner of the}} garden, when he was three weeks from the holidays, and pulled one up every day with a great wrench, throwing it to a distance.|$|R

25|$|The {{causes of}} the war, the reasons for its outcome, and even {{the name of the}} war itself are {{subjects}} of lingering contention today. The North and West grew rich while the once-rich South became poor for a century. The national political power of the slaveowners and rich southerners ended. Historians are less <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> the results of the postwar Reconstruction, especially regarding the second class citizenship of the Freedmen and their poverty.|$|E

He did not deny that he had been a fool; he saw it almost as clearly as at midnight; but anything, he struggled, was better than going back to a life of barren heartiness. At four he wanted a drink. He kept a whisky flask in his desk now, and after two minutes of battle he had his drink. Three drinks later he began to see the Bunch as tender and amusing friends, and by six he was with them [...] . and the tale was to be told all over.|$|R

He makes a list of firms he wants to work for, assembles a portfolio, and goes to job interviews. On day 488, Summer is waiting for Tom at his favorite spot in the city and they talk. Summer explains that Tom was right about true love existing; he was just wrong about it being with her. She says she got married because she felt <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> her husband, something she wasn't with Tom. Summer puts her hand on Tom's and says she is glad to see he is doing well. As she leaves, Tom tells her he really hopes she is happy.|$|E
25|$|King Janamejaya's {{ancestor}} Shantanu, {{the king}} of Hastinapura, has a short-lived marriage with the goddess Ganga and has a son, Devavrata (later to be called Bhishma, a great warrior), who becomes the heir apparent. Many years later, when King Shantanu goes hunting, he sees Satyavati, {{the daughter of the}} chief of fisherman, and asks her father for her hand. Her father refuses to consent to the marriage unless Shantanu promises to make any future son of Satyavati the king upon his death. To resolve his father's dilemma, Devavrata agrees to relinquish his right to the throne. As the fisherman is not <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> the prince's children honouring the promise, Devavrata also takes a vow of lifelong celibacy to guarantee his father's promise.|$|E
25|$|Psychologists Jack Block and Jeanne Block {{evaluated}} Genie in February 1971 and put {{her language}} below the two-year-old level on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale. During the next month her vocabulary acquisition began to accelerate at a progressively more rapid pace, with observers putting her active vocabulary at over 100 words. Doctors noted that she seemed to know far more words than she would spontaneously say, but could not be <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> the extent of either her receptive or expressive vocabulary {{because she was so}} responsive to nonverbal stimuli. After another month, Genie began spontaneously producing one-word utterances and began to understand increasingly complex sentences. Soon after she appeared to understand some basic elements of the give-and-take nature of conversation, and without prompting could provide non-imitative one-word responses to statements or questions.|$|E

25|$|The match {{had already}} had a moment of {{controversy}} earlier. During the Australian innings, Martin Snedden claimed a low outfield catch off the batting of Greg Chappell when Chappell was on 58. It was ruled not out by the umpires. It was some years before TV replays {{could be used in}} umpiring decisions. Viewers watching replays had divided opinions: some thought it was a clean catch, while others say it passed through the fielder's fingers to touch the grass before coming to rest in his hands. (If modern TV umpiring review had been in use, there was sufficient doubt to rule it not out.) Some commentators believed that Chappell should have taken Snedden's word that the catch was good, as had been a time honoured tradition. Chappell maintained he was not <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> the catch and was within his rights to wait for the umpires to rule. Chappell went on to score 90, before he was caught by Bruce Edgar in similar fashion. This time, Chappell walked after he clearly saw the fielder had cupped his hands under the ball.|$|E

Very little is known for <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> George Woldemar's origin or education.

[...] "We definitely wanted {{him to have a}} messianic streak", said Soderbergh, whom Law talked to during the character's creating process. The two men discussed the appearances and the behaviors of a typical anti-government conspiracy theorist. Producer Gregory Jacobs commented that [...] "what's interesting is that you're not really <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> him. Is the government really hiding something and does the herbal remedy he's talking about really work? I think we all suspect {{at one time or another}} that we're not getting the whole truth, and in that sense Krumwiede represents the audience's point of view." ...|$|E

Schreier found the touch controls to be [...] "just fine", but thought that the game would work better with a D-pad and buttons. He praised the presentation, saying that the music was [...] "superb" [...] and that the game looked great. Slater thought that the game's look was impressive and that the music was excellent. Musgrave called the music [...] "outstanding", and found the monster characters to look fantastic, having benefited greatly from the updated 3D graphics; he was less <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> the art direction for the human characters, but still thought that they looked better {{than they did in}} Sword of Mana.|$|E

[...] "I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> this song. I don't think I {{want to put it}} on the album. I don't really like it that much. It's just O.K.", she said. However, she was convinced to record it and, once she listened to the finished product, she changed her mind. She thought it was odd, but in a positive light, and decided to include it on her debut album. Cyrus says [...] "See You Again" [...] is a dance song with a special meaning to her. The song was remixed by Rock Mafia for the release of Cyrus' second studio album Breakout (2008).|$|E
500|$|Kim Manners {{said that}} it seemed all the {{prominent}} pieces created for The X-Files were created by [...] "accident". According to Manners, Davis {{was nothing more than}} an extra leaning on a shelf. At the start, the producers of the show were not <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> making the Smoking Man the main antagonist. Paul Rabwin commented once {{that he did not know}} if Davis could handle the role, because he was not sure if he was a [...] "good enough" [...] actor for the role. Manners later commented that Davis knew that the Smoking Man had two different characters, the first being the one played by Davis and the second was the cigarettes. He further stated that the cigarette smoke could tell a [...] "whole story" [...] by itself, thanks to Davis' talent.|$|E

However, her film career was not as successful as she had hoped it would be. Following the commercially successful Desperately Seeking Susan, her 1986 film Shanghai Surprise—where she starred with her then husband Sean Penn—was {{a critical}} and box-office failure, prompting Madonna to comment that she [...] "struggled {{to come to terms}} with her character in Shanghai Surprise, because the innocence and repressed personality I was required to portray was so at variance with my own character." [...] Continuing to struggle with her film career, Madonna was unsure of her ability to choose a good script, and film producers were less <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> backing her up.|$|E
