40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{clinical}} characteristics, epidemiology, and some current theories of etiology of eating disorders in female athletes. Two of the major disorders of concern to today's student-athlete were anorexia nervosa and bulimia. Anorexia was <b>self-imposed</b> <b>starvation</b> in an obsessive effort to lose weight and become thin. Bulimia was characterized by secretive binge-eating episodes usually followed by purging in the form of self-induced vomiting or using laxatives or diuretics. Subjects were 125 females between the ages of 14 - 21 years of age. Thirty-seven were in high school and 38 were in college; all of whom participated in sports. Twenty-five high school and 25 college students served as the control group. The subjects were given the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI). The questionnaire consisted of 64 questions which measured a variety of attitudes, feelings, and behaviors. The EDI consisted of eight subscales. Body Mass Index (BMI) was computed. Findings indicated that none of these athletes had scores indicative of the constellation of disturbances in eating patterns and personality attributes seen in anorexia nervosa and bulimia. Rather, results suggested that the typical high school and college female athlete falls into the normal range with regard to body mass and eating patterns. The competitive female cross-country runner actually may be at slightly less risk for body dissatisfaction than her nonathlete counterpart, whereas the gymnast may be at somewhat greater risk for weight preoccupation.

40|$|Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is {{characterized}} by a <b>self-imposed</b> <b>starvation</b> and is often accompanied by excessive exercise that results in severe malnutrition and sometimes death. Behavioural and pharmacological treatments of AN need to be improved. In rats, acute 3 h daytime wheel access suppresses ad lib feeding over the subsequent night relative to no wheel controls, a phenomenon that has been suggested as an animal model of AN. This acute wheel induced feeding suppression (WIFS), can be induced reliably when rats are given limited wheel access exposure during the light cycle (Lattanzio 2 ̆ 6 Eikelboom, 2003). The acute WIFS is useful because {{it can be used to}} test the effects of pharmacological agents, in a paradigm where the duration of wheel running and its effects are tightly defined. Chronic chlorpromazine injections can minimize the severity of activity anorexia (AA) procedure (Routtenberg, 1968), a related rat model of AN (Epling, Pierce 2 ̆ 6 Stephan, 1983), by attenuating wheel running. Experiment 1 tested the acute effects of a one-time chlorpromazine injection (2 mg/kg IP) on the acute WIFS in 40 adult male rats. Animals were divided into five treatment groups (n= 8) : drug before wheel access (DW); drug after wheel access (WD); drug with locked wheel access (DNW); saline with locked wheel access (SNW); and saline with wheel access (SW). Half of each of the three control groups (DNW, SNW and SW) received injections before wheel access and half were injected after the wheel access period. Experiment 2 followed the same procedure except a broader range of chlorpromazine doses was tested (0. 25, 0. 50, 1 and 2 mg/kg). Both studies show that while chlorpromazine (at 1 and 2 mg/kg) did not attenuate feeding or wheel running, it blocked the acute WIFS. At doses of 0. 25 and 0. 50 mg/kg chlorpromazine had no effect. Because the pharmacological profile of chlorpromazine implicates the serotonin, histamine and dopamine systems in the acute WIFS (and potentially AN), future work should look at drugs with more specific modes of action to identify which neurotransmitter systems may be involved. The acute WIFS procedure may be useful for screening potential drug treatments for AN, where exercise is often elevated and feeding is suppressed...|$|E
