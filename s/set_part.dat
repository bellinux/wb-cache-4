25|$|Using his frigates to {{blockade}} the harbour, Bligh {{moved his}} ships {{of the line}} to a small cove, and exchanged fire with a shore battery. He landed a party of sailors and marines, carrying the battery without loss and then storming the heights around the cove, driving the Dutch away with four or five casualties among the British party. Having secured a landing site, Bligh sent 600 men ashore and landed some cannon, which he placed {{so as to be}} able to bombard Fort Republique and the town of St Anne. Contrary to reports, the Dutch had received significant reinforcements and though Bligh was able to <b>set</b> <b>part</b> of the town on fire, he was forced to constantly skirmish with Dutch forces, which numbered around 500 men. Though the Dutch were continually repulsed, British losses mounted, exacerbated by outbreaks of dysentery. With no quick end to the conflict in sight, and mindful that he had been warned not to overextend himself, Bligh called off the attack on 4 March, having exhausted his ammunition of 18 pounder shot. He re-embarked his men and returned to Jamaica, having sustained losses of 18 killed and 43 wounded. Though the British force had failed to capture the island, Duckworth was sympathetic, and felt that Bligh could have succeeded had the men and guns of HMS Vanguard been at his disposal.|$|E

500|$|Poe {{had been}} {{stationed}} at Fort Moultrie from November 1827 through December 1828 and utilized his personal experience at Sullivan's Island in recreating {{the setting for}} [...] "The Gold-Bug". It was also here that Poe first heard the stories of pirates like Captain Kidd. The residents of Sullivan's Island embrace this connection to Poe and have named their public library after him. Local legend in Charleston says that the poem [...] "Annabel Lee" [...] was also inspired by Poe's time in South Carolina. Poe also <b>set</b> <b>part</b> of [...] "The Balloon-Hoax" [...] and [...] "The Oblong Box" [...] in this vicinity.|$|E
500|$|However, Poe {{retired from}} his {{role at the}} Messenger on January 3, 1837, as the {{installments}} were being published; some scholars suggest he was fired and this led him to abandoning the novel. His split with the Messenger began a [...] "blank period" [...] where he did not publish much and suffered from unemployment, poverty, and no success in his literary pursuits. Poe soon realized writing a book-length narrative was a necessary career decision, partly {{because he had no}} steady job and the economy was suffering from the Panic of 1837. He also <b>set</b> <b>part</b> of the story as a quest to Antarctica to capitalize the public's sudden interest in that topic.|$|E

By purchasing broadcast rights to Douglas Gayeton's machinima documentary Molotov Alva and His Search for the Creator in September 2007, HBO became the first television network to buy a work created completely in a virtual world. In December 2008, machinima.com signed fifteen experienced television comedy writers—including Patric Verrone, Bill Oakley, and Mike Rowe—to produce episodes for the site.|$|E

2500|$|The {{operation}} had to {{be postponed}} for weather several times, but the 77-ship fleet, reinforced by the [...] and the small [...] , was in position {{on the morning of}} 7 September. Visibility was excellent everywhere but over the target which was covered by a haze, and Admiral Bacon ordered a withdrawal. German submarines and aircraft attacked as they were leaving, but the monitors took no damage. The monitors returned in the afternoon when the haze cleared and Lord Clive opened fire at 15:30 with a ranging shot on the Ostende lighthouse. However an hitherto unknown battery of four long-range [...] guns began to return fire and soon began to near-miss Lord Clive. She steamed out to sea to open up the range, but her speed was so slow that the Germans had no difficulties compensating for the additional range and she was hit four times in quick succession about 15:50. One hit on the port bulge aft, another alongside the bulge forward, one on the bow and another, that failed to explode, on the starboard two pounder gun, knocking the gun down to the quarterdeck. Only fourteen rounds were fired by the monitors before Admiral Bacon ordered them to retire, one of which <b>set</b> <b>part</b> of the dockyard on fire.|$|E
60|$|There {{were three}} dynamos with their engines at Camberwell. The two {{that had been}} there since the {{beginning}} were small machines; the larger one was new. The smaller machines made a reasonable noise; their straps hummed over the drums, {{every now and then}} the brushes buzzed and fizzled, and the air churned steadily, whoo! whoo! whoo! between their poles. One was loose in its foundations and kept the shed vibrating. But the big dynamo drowned these little noises altogether with the sustained drone of its iron core, which somehow <b>set</b> <b>part</b> of the ironwork humming. The place made the visitor's head reel with the throb, throb, throb of the engines, the rotation of the big wheels, the spinning ball-valves, the occasional spittings of the steam, and over all the deep, unceasing, surging note of the big dynamo. This last noise was from an engineering point of view a defect, but Azuma-zi accounted it unto the monster for mightiness and pride.|$|E

60|$|They were resolved, however, to {{continue}} their old work of protecting the Mediterranean travelers, and thankfully accepted, as {{a gift from the}} Emperor Charles V., the little islet of Malta as their new station. It was a great contrast to their former home, being little more than a mere rock rising steeply out of the sea, white, glaring and with very shallow earth, unfit to bear corn, though it produced plenty of oranges, figs, and melons--with little water, and no wood,--the buildings wretched, {{and for the most part}} uninhabited, and the few people a miserable mongrel <b>set,</b> <b>part</b> Arab, part Greek, part Sicilian, and constantly kept down by the descents of the Moorish pirates, who used to land in the unprotected bays, and carry off all the wretched beings they could catch, to sell for slaves. It was a miserable exchange from fertile Rhodes, which was nearly five times larger than this barren rock; but the Knights only wanted a hospital, a fortress, and a harbour; and this last they found in the deeply indented northern shore, while they made the first two. Only a few years had passed before the dreary Citta Notabile had become in truth a notable city, full of fine castle-like houses, infirmaries, and noble churches, and fenced in with mighty wall and battlements-- country houses were perched upon the rocks--the harbors were fortified, and filled with vessels of war--and deep vaults were hollowed out in the rock, in which corn was stored sufficient to supply the inhabitants for many months.|$|E
