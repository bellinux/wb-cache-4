40|$|This study {{develops}} a tree augmented naive Bayesian (TAN) classifier based incident detection algorithm. Compared with the Bayesian networks based detection algorithms {{developed in the}} previous studies, this algorithm has less dependency on experts’ knowledge. The structure <b>of</b> <b>TAN</b> classifier for incident detection is learned from data. The discretization of continuous attributes is processed using an entropy-based method automatically. A simulation dataset on {{the section of the}} Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE) in Singapore is used to demonstrate the development of proposed algorithm, including wavelet denoising, normalization, entropy-based discretization, and structure learning. The performance <b>of</b> <b>TAN</b> based algorithm is evaluated compared with the previous developed Bayesian network (BN) based and multilayer feed forward (MLF) neural networks based algorithms with the same AYE data. The experiment results show that the TAN based algorithms perform better than the BN classifiers and have a similar performance to the MLF based algorithm. However, TAN based algorithm would have wider vista of applications because the theory <b>of</b> <b>TAN</b> classifiers is much less complicated than MLF. It should be found from the experiment that the TAN classifier based algorithm has a significant superiority over the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> model training and calibration compared with MLF...|$|R

5000|$|When tanning bed became {{implemented}} the concept <b>of</b> <b>tanning</b> changed yet again. The first self tanner, Tan-Man, {{was introduced in}} 1959, and UV tanning beds started {{to appear in the}} United States in 1978.

40|$|Transnational {{advocacy}} networks’ anti-child trafficking {{efforts have}} led to significant progress in the Mekong Subregion by bringing the child trafficking issue onto the global social policy agenda, resulting in new child protection legislation and improved inter-agency collaboration in the region. However, a significant gap in both the literature on TANs and TAN practice {{is the lack of}} monitoring and evaluation <b>of</b> <b>TAN</b> ‘effectiveness’. This article discusses the recent literature on TAN effectiveness and discusses the ‘key elements’ <b>of</b> <b>TAN</b> effectiveness, as highlighted by child trafficking experts operating in TANs in the Greater Mekong Subregion. Research into the area <b>of</b> <b>TAN</b> effectiveness is important for improving our knowledge <b>of</b> what <b>TANs</b> are achieving in terms of preventing child trafficking and protecting victims, as well as improving our knowledge of the different meanings and interpretations <b>of</b> <b>TAN</b> ‘effectiveness’.

50|$|One of {{the common}} uses for tanning beds is the option <b>of</b> <b>tanning</b> {{completely}} nude to reduce the appearance <b>of</b> <b>tan</b> lines.

30|$|Figure  8 {{shows the}} graph <b>of</b> <b>tan</b> delta versus temperature. The tan delta curve closely resembles the loss modulus curve {{leading to the}} glass {{transition}} tan delta values well below 0.1. The rapid rise in tan delta values closely resembles the rapid decline in storage modulus values. The peak value <b>of</b> <b>tan</b> delta indicates that the material is nonelastic, whereas the lower value <b>of</b> <b>tan</b> delta indicates that the material is elastic in nature (Agarwal et al. [2013]). Region 1 shows that the material is highly elastic in this region, and as the value <b>of</b> <b>tan</b> delta shifts to region 2, the nature of material shifts from elastic to plastic. The peak value <b>of</b> <b>tan</b> delta indicates that any further increase in temperature beyond this changes the material from elastic to plastic zone. Figure  8 shows that {{as the percentage of}} fiber/filler increases, the peak value shifts towards higher temperature resulting in wider elastic range of temperature, whereas as the percentage of fiber/filler decreases, the peak value shifts towards the lower temperature range resulting in narrow elastic range.|$|R
