5|$|In 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, by {{the royal}} {{prerogative}} of Queen Elizabeth I, founded St. John's, Newfoundland, {{as the first}} North American English colony. French explorer Samuel de Champlain arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent European settlements at Port Royal (in 1605) and Quebec City (in 1608). Among the colonists of New France, Canadiens extensively <b>settled</b> <b>the</b> Saint Lawrence River valley and Acadians <b>settled</b> <b>the</b> present-day Maritimes, while fur traders and Catholic missionaries explored the Great Lakes, Hudson Bay, and the Mississippi watershed to Louisiana.

5|$|According to {{linguistic}} sources, the Baltic tribes precursors appeared first inland, in {{the forest}} zone regions far from the sea, and only later <b>settled</b> <b>the</b> near Baltic Sea areas, extending from the northeastern part of the Vistula basin to the Daugava River basin.

5|$|Finney {{disagreed}} with the accidental voyaging portion of Sharp's hypothesis. To investigate the problem, he founded the Polynesian Voyaging Society with Herb Kane and Tommy Holmes in 1973, intent on building a voyaging canoe to sail from Hawaii to Tahiti to test whether intentional two-way voyaging throughout Oceania could be replicated. With the help of Mau's navigational knowledge guiding Hōkūle‘a, the Polynesian Voyaging Society demonstrated that intentional voyaging was not only possible, but also the ancestors of the Polynesians could have <b>settled</b> <b>the</b> Pacific on similar voyages using non-instrument wayfinding techniques such as Mau's. Finally, linguistic and archaeological {{evidence suggests that the}} history of the Polynesian people does not originate in the East Pacific but in the West. Recent developments in the field of DNA analysis have unequivocally <b>settled</b> <b>the</b> debate of Polynesian origin. They prove Polynesians share common ancestry with indigenous Taiwanese and East Asians.|$|E
5|$|In 1153 or 1154, Chesney was the {{recipient}} of the lordship of a hundred and a half in Norfolk, possibly in compensation for the loss of the manor of Mileham.

Both William's father Robert and his elder brother John had held these offices before him.|$|E
30|$|The {{concept of}} {{permissible}} delay period in <b>settling</b> <b>the</b> payment is widespread in business. In the classical EOQ model, {{it was assumed}} that <b>the</b> retailer must <b>settle</b> <b>the</b> account after receiving the items immediately. But, this situation is not true in reality. Because, in practice for encouraging the retailer to buy more, the supplier will allow a fixed period of time for <b>settling</b> <b>the</b> account and will not charge any amount from the retailer. Thus, when the supplier offers the retailer a delay period in <b>settling</b> <b>the</b> amount is known as trade credit period. This helps the retailer to reduce the on-hand inventory level and they can earn interest from the sales revenue.|$|R

5|$|Archeology {{nevertheless}} {{shows the}} evolution of the Oksywie culture to be the fundamental source of the Wielbark culture, as the two cultures extended over exactly the same territory and continuously used the same cemeteries. The locally present Veneti and Rugians became influenced by the Goths or their Scandinavian protoplasts. It is presently believed that the Scandinavian arrivals directly <b>settled</b> <b>the</b> areas where the great cult kurgan and stone burial grounds are found. They are referred to as the Odry-Węsiory-Grzybnica type, were established {{in the second half of}} 1st century AD and occur in parts of Pomerania west of the Vistula, up to the Koszalin area. The contemporary and rather closely related Wielbark culture in (previously settled by the Przeworsk culture) Greater Poland, represented by the Kowalewko cemetery, lacks however for the most part the kurgans and the stone structures. The Wielbark people came here from Pomerania.|$|E
