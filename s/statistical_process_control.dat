25|$|JUSE {{members had}} studied Shewhart's techniques, {{and as part}} of Japan's {{reconstruction}} efforts, they sought an expert to teach statistical control.

25|$|Process variations: With MOSFETs {{becoming}} smaller, {{the number}} of atoms in the silicon that produce many of the transistor's properties is becoming fewer, {{with the result that}} control of dopant numbers and placement is more erratic. During chip manufacturing, random process variations affect all transistor dimensions: length, width, junction depths, oxide thickness etc., and become a greater percentage of overall transistor size as the transistor shrinks. The transistor characteristics become less certain, more statistical. The random nature of manufacture means we do not know which particular example MOSFETs actually will end up in a particular instance of the circuit. This uncertainty forces a less optimal design because the design must work for a great variety of possible component MOSFETs.

In recent years an alternate Shewhart-type statistical quality control charts called g-chart has been developed for <b>controlling</b> <b>process</b> variation where failure is infrequent like hospital acquired infections. However, g-chart, EWMA chart and probability based control charts, which are the main control charts used for monitoring infrequent failure processes fail to detect changes in the process quickly enough. As a solution it was proposed to inspect and follow-up on every failure that occurs in the process. A mathematical model for the long-run cost of a quality control policy is developed. This model is used to compare the cost of following up on every failure policy with the cost of using statistical control chart for monitoring processes. By comparing the total cost per hour of using statistical control chart method with the total cost per hour of following up on every failure, it is concluded that following up on every failure policy results in quick detection of changes in the process and it is also a more cost efficient method...|$|R

2500|$|Conical {{micrometer}} anvils, specifically {{suited to}} {{resting on the}} sides of the thread, are made for various thread angles, with 60° being the most common. Mics with such anvils are usually called [...] "thread mics" [...] or [...] "pitch mics" [...] (because they directly measure the pitch diameter). Users who lack thread mics rely instead on the [...] "3-wire method", which involves placing 3 short pieces of wire (or gauge pins) of known diameter into the valleys of the thread and then measuring from wire to wire with standard (flat) anvils. A conversion factor (produced by a straightforward trigonometric calculation) is then multiplied with the measured value to infer a measurement of the thread's pitch diameter. Tables of these conversion factors were established many decades ago for all standard thread sizes, so today a user need only take the measurement and then perform the table lookup (as opposed to recalculating each time). The 3-wire method is also used when high precision is needed to inspect a specific diameter, commonly the pitch diameter, or on specialty threads such as multi-start or when the thread angle is not 60°. [...] Ball-shaped micrometer anvils can be used in similar fashion (same trigonometric relationship, less cumbersome to use). Digital calipers and micrometers can send each measurement (data point) as it occurs to storage or software through an interface (such as USB or RS-232), in which case the table lookup is done in an automated way, and quality assurance and quality control can be achieved using <b>statistical</b> <b>process</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E
