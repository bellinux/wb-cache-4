50|$|In Australia, {{the term}} {{tribunal}} generally implies a judicial {{body with a}} lesser degree of formality than a court, with a <b>simplified</b> <b>legal</b> <b>procedure,</b> often presided over by a lawyer (solicitor or barrister) {{who is not a}} judge or magistrate (often referred to {{as a member of the}} tribunal). In many cases the lawyers who function as tribunal members do so only on a part time basis, and spend the greater part of their time carrying out other aspects of legal practice, such as representing clients. In many cases, the formal rules of evidence which apply in courts do not apply in tribunals, which enables tribunals to hear forms of evidence which courts may not be allowed to consider. Tribunals generally deal with simpler matters; while legal representation is permitted and not uncommon, self-representation is much more common in tribunals than in courts, and tribunal members and registry staff are generally more accustomed to dealing with self-represented parties than courts are. Appeal from a tribunal is to a court.|$|E

5000|$|From 1922 to 1923 he was Labor and Social Protection Minister, and Justice Minister from 1923 to 1926. In that capacity, {{he pushed}} {{through a number}} of laws; among the {{subjects}} these dealt with were acquisition and loss of Romanian citizenship; combating offenses against public order; <b>simplifying</b> <b>legal</b> <b>procedures</b> for speedier trials; reorganizing courts, particularly in the territories acquired {{at the end of the}} war; restricting firearm ownership; simplifying procedures for heirs of those killed in action during the war; reforming the High Court of Cassation and Justice; and setting up a Legislative Council—the last two in pursuance of the new 1923 Constitution. The citizenship law allowed for the naturalization of Jews, which made Mârzescu a leading target for assassination by far right activist Corneliu Zelea Codreanu and his allies.|$|R
25|$|It was {{inevitable}} that the high regard {{in which he was}} held as a lawyer should lead to his being named on various state commissions of reform. In 1872, less than a decade after he began to practice law, the Connecticut legislature elected him one of a commission of five that made the Revision of 1875, the General Statutes of the State of Connecticut. In the same year {{he was a member of}} a state commission appointed to revise the education laws. Six years later he was named by the governor of Connecticut acting under a resolution of the state legislature one of a commission of five to inquire into the feasibility of <b>simplifying</b> <b>legal</b> <b>procedure.</b> This commission drew up a set of rules and forms which were approved and adopted by the court as the basis of pleading in civil cases.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2006, new {{legislation}} was passed {{to apply the}} benefits included in Short Laws I & II (see Recent Developments section below for details) to renewable energy production. The new regulation provided for exemptions in transmission charges for [...] new renewable energy sources (i.e. geothermal, wind, solar, biomass, tidal, small hydropower and cogeneration) below 20 MW of capacity. It also <b>simplified</b> the <b>legal</b> <b>procedures</b> for projects below 9 MW. The success of this new regulation {{for the promotion of}} renewable sources is yet to be seen.|$|R
5000|$|Vyavahāra (व्यवहार) is an {{important}} concept of Hindu law denoting <b>legal</b> <b>procedure.</b> The term is analyzed by Kātyāyana as follows: [...] "Vi means ‘various,’ ava means ‘doubt,’ hara is ‘removal’; <b>legal</b> <b>procedure</b> is called by the term vyavahāra because ‘it removes various doubts.’” Kane defines it as follows: [...] "When the ramifications of right conduct, that are together called dharma {{and that can be}} established with efforts (of various kinds such as truthful speech, etc.) have been violated, the dispute (in a court between parties) which springs from what is sought to be proved (such as debt), is said to be vyavahāra." [...] According to Donald Davis, “There are two basic meanings of vyavahāra. The first is a general sense of practice, business, or everyday transactions. The other, specific sense is <b>legal</b> <b>procedure,</b> the processes of litigation including a trial.” [...] <b>Legal</b> <b>procedure</b> according to the dharmaśāstras includes: court, listening to and assessing witnesses and their testimony, deciding and enforcing punishment, and the pursuit of Justice in the face of Injustice. Davis later quotes the [...] in an attempt to answer the question why <b>legal</b> <b>procedure</b> came about in the Hindu tradition. The text states, “When men had dharma as their only focus and were speakers of the truth, there was no <b>legal</b> <b>procedure,</b> no enmity, and no (selfish) conflict. <b>Legal</b> <b>procedure</b> came into being when dharma was lost among men." ...|$|R
