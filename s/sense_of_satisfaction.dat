5|$|Super Mario Bros. 3 has {{received}} universal acclaim from modern critics who consider the title {{to be one}} of the best games of all time. Edge considered Super Mario Bros. 3 Nintendo's standout title of 1989, and commented that its success outshone the first Super Mario Bros.s sales milestone; the first title sold 40million copies but was bundled with the NES. They lauded the overworld map as an elegant alternative to a menu to select levels. Allgame's Skyler Miller praised the game's level design, graphics, music, and nonlinearity. Dengeki referred to the game as a popular title and expressed excitement over its re-release on the Game Boy Advance system. The items hidden in the game's levels, such as the warp whistles, were well-received: Rignall regarded them as part of the game's addictiveness, and Sheff stated that finding them provided a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>satisfaction.</b> Both Screw Attack and GamesRadar ranked it the best NES game made. GamesRadar claimed that while Super Mario Bros. defined its genre, Super Mario Bros. 3 perfected it.|$|E
5|$|The defence next {{engaged in}} a lengthy direct {{examination}} of Eichmann. Observers such as Moshe Pearlman and Hannah Arendt have remarked on Eichmann's ordinariness in appearance and flat affect. In his testimony throughout the trial, Eichmann insisted {{he had no choice}} but to follow orders, as he was bound by an oath of loyalty—the same superior orders defence used by some defendants in the 1945–1946 Nuremberg trials. Eichmann asserted that the decisions had been made not by him, but by Müller, Heydrich, Himmler, and ultimately Hitler. Servatius also proposed that decisions of the Nazi government were acts of state and therefore not subject to normal judicial proceedings. Regarding the Wannsee Conference, Eichmann stated that he felt a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>satisfaction</b> and relief at its conclusion. As a clear decision to exterminate had been made by his superiors, the matter was out of his hands; he felt absolved of any guilt. On the last day of the examination, he stated that he was guilty of arranging the transports, but he did not feel guilty for the consequences.|$|E
25|$|Art classes {{also can}} have a {{therapeutic}} effect on retired people's well-being. Retired participants who regularly took art classes were interviewed about their previous art class participation. They felt that painting gave a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>satisfaction</b> and achievement with their many free hours. It also boosted confidence (from noticing improvement over time in their paintings), productivity, and offered an opportunity for participants to be encouraged to discuss art with others.|$|E

25|$|Quilts {{can have}} many {{different}} templates or patterns {{and they can}} have a large impact on the final result. There are a number of mediums that can be used and depending on the usage, size, and style they will give your quilt a varied look. Templates are generally considered the basis {{of the structure of the}} quilt, like a blueprint for a house. If used properly it can help quilters produce a quilt of their liking and give them a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>satisfaction</b> and vision for future quilts they want to make.|$|E
25|$|The {{benefits}} of undergoing anger management brings around the successful reduction in anger and violent outbursts. Personal relationships {{that have been}} previously strained by {{a high level of}} aggression may undergo improvement. Professionally, workplace relationships have a similar outcome that are beneficial to an individual's career and personal <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>satisfaction.</b> Legally, continued attendance to anger management programs, mandated or not, {{can be seen as a}} sign of good faith. For incarcerated individuals, an earlier parole time can be the result of good behavior learned from anger management classes. From an emotional standpoint, reducing the internal level of anger results in a decrease in stress and an increase in overall happiness as a result.|$|E
25|$|While {{consonant}} intervals (intervals of a {{third or}} sixth) and perfect intervals (intervals of a fourth, fifth, eighth) are greatly important, dissonant intervals can occur within music, which is why resolutions are vital. The most basic rule of resolution is to always resolve the leading tone upwards (the leading tones being the 7th scales degree of the key that the piece is in). When resolving the seventh scale degree to the tonic, it creates a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>satisfaction</b> and completion, relieving the tension that it created. Tritones also must be resolved correctly. These can occur in triads or seventh chords {{that are based on}} scale degree seven, and they must be resolved correctly. A tritone can either be an augmented fourth intervals or a diminished fifth based on the voicing that the composer uses. In common practice, an augmented fourth must resolve out, meaning the top voice resolves up and the bottom voice resolves down, creating a sixth Opposite of that a diminished fifth must resolve in, where the top voice resolves down and the bottom voice resolves up, creating an interval {{of a third}}.|$|E

500|$|Israel {{qualified}} one rider in the women's Olympic road race, Shani Bloch, {{by virtue}} of a top-22 international finish in the 2016 Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) World Rankings, signifying the nation's Olympic comeback to the sport {{for the first time}} since 1960. Bloch had retired in 2004 to start a family, but came out of retirement in 2014, training with her Israeli teammates to qualify for Rio.

[...] Bloch was ranked 88 in the world at the time of qualification, and finished in 48th place with a time of 4:02:59.|$|E
2500|$|This notion was {{forwarded}} by the British to Calcutta and {{the reply}} {{was that it}} was [...] "inappropriate for the Government" [...] to construct [...] "anything" [...] over the remains of Zafar as a tomb [...] "which might become a place of pilgrimage." [...] This was followed by demonstrations and a [...] "long series of newspaper articles" [...] by which the British agreed in 1907 to erect a single stone slab in which it was engraved [...] "Bahadur Shah, ex-King of Delhi died at Rangoon November 7th, 1862 and was buried near this spot." [...] The Rangoon Times of 26 August 1907 reported that a meeting would be held at the Victoria Hall to [...] "record a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>satisfaction</b> among the Mohammedan community for the erection of the present memorial." [...] Later that year, a memorial stone devoted to Zinat Mahal was added. Zafar's granddaughter, Raunaq Zamani, was also buried nearby. Though the spot was lost, people knew that Zafar was buried somewhat south of Shwedagon Pagoda.|$|E
2500|$|Rats {{have also}} been {{used to test the}} {{possibility}} of a problem with dopamine levels in the brains of animals that exhibit compulsive checking behavior. [...] After treating rats with quinpirole, a chemical that specifically blocks dopamine D2/D3 receptors, compulsive checking of certain locations in an open field increased. [...] Some components of the checking behavior, such as the level of stereotypy in the path animals took to checked locations, the number of checks, and the length of the checks indicated and increase in compulsivity as doses of quinpirole increased; other components, such as the time taken to return from the checked location to the starting point and the time taken to make that trip remained constant after the initial injection throughout the experiment. [...] This means that there might be both all-or-none and a sensitization aspects in the biology of the dopamine deficiency model of OCD. [...] In addition, quinpirole might reduce a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>satisfaction</b> in the rats after they check a location, causing them to return to that location again and again.|$|E

60|$|There was no {{question}} in my mind about the hospitality of this home and so with a very comfortable, a delightful <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> peace, <b>of</b> <b>satisfaction,</b> <b>of</b> security, I set out on my way to San Francisco, Portland and Olympia, eager to see California--all of it. Its mountains, its cities and above all its poets had long called to me. It meant the Argonauts and The Songs of the Sierras to me, and one of my main objects of destination was Joaquin Miller's home in Oakland Heights.|$|R

What he said of me I do not know, but I fear he reported me as living in unimaginable luxury and consorting on terms of equality with the great ones of New York.|$|R
2500|$|David Brauer of MinnPost {{said that}} some Hmong liked Gran Torino and that many {{believed}} that the film was offensive. Actor Bee Vang said [...] "Hmong around the country were furious about its negative stereotypes and cultural distortions" [...] and that they confronted him when he spoke at events. Vang added that he engaged in [...] "explaining my obligation as an actor while also recognizing that, as a Hmong-American, I didn't feel that I could own the lines I was uttering." [...] Brauer said that in an opinion editorial released in 2011, Vang [...] "isn't kind to the Clint Eastwood film". Krissy Reyes-Ortiz of The Bottom Line of the University of California Santa Barbara said, based on Vang's testimony in a 2011 program, that [...] "Though {{many of the people}} who have seen the film may have gotten a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>satisfaction</b> and joy from seeing that Walt overcame his racism, the people who acted as the Hmong members in the movie did not" [...] and that [...] "They were offended by the traces of racism that were included in the movie and that they experienced themselves on set". Some Hmong on internet message boards had posted criticisms of the film.|$|E
