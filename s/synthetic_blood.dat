2500|$|The fictional {{universe}} {{depicted in}} the series is premised {{on the notion that}} vampires exist, unbeknownst to the majority of humans until two years before the series premiere, when the creation of <b>synthetic</b> <b>blood</b> ("Tru Blood") by Japanese scientists, which eliminated vampires' need for human blood to survive, allowed vampires to [...] "come out of the coffin" [...] and reveal their existence to the world. This so-called [...] "Great Revelation" [...] has split vampires into two camps: those who wish to integrate into human society (i.e., [...] "mainstream") by campaigning for citizenship and equal rights, and those who think human-vampire co-existence is impossible, because it conflicts with the inherently predatory and violent nature of vampires. It has also caused similar divisions amongst non-vampires; some believe that they should be accepted and granted rights, while others view them as monsters to be destroyed. [...] Throughout the series, other supernatural creatures are introduced, among them shapeshifters, werewolves, faeries, witches, and a maenad.|$|E
40|$|Coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in haemostasis. To date, physiologic activity of FVIII circulating in the bloodstream (S-FVIII) is evaluated by classic coagulation assays. However, the functional relevance of FVIII (-von Willebrand factor complex) immobilised on thrombogenic surfaces (I-FVIII) remains unclear. We used an in vitro perfusion chamber system to evaluate the function of I-FVIII in the process of mural thrombus formation under whole blood flow conditions. In perfusion of either control or <b>synthetic</b> haemophilic <b>blood,</b> the intra-thrombus fibrin generation on platelet surfaces significantly increased as a function of I-FVIII, independent of S-FVIII, under high shear rate conditions. This I-FVIII effect was unvarying regardless of anti-FVIII inhibitor levels in <b>synthetic</b> haemophilic <b>blood.</b> Thus, our results illustrate coagulation potentials of immobilised clotting factors, distinct from those in the bloodstream, under physiologic flow conditions and may give a clue for novel therapeutic approaches for haemophilic patients with anti-FVIII inhibitors. 博士（医学）・甲第 602 号・平成 25 年 7 月 22 日The definitive version is available at " [URL]...|$|R

The osmolality, tonicity, pH, electrolyte composition (chloride, sodium, potassium, etc.) and levels of other metabolically active compounds (lactate, acetate, malate, etc.) are all equally important. Clinical factors (underlying conditions, kidney or liver failure, presence of capillary leak, acid–base equilibrium, albumin levels, fluid balance, etc.) must all {{be taken into account}} when choosing the type and amount of fluid for a given patient at a given time. Moreover, the type of fluid is different depending on the reason why they are administered.

[...] A recent application of microbial cellulose has been as <b>synthetic</b> <b>blood</b> vessels and stents.

30|$|In {{the present}} work, each image frame {{had to be}} sorted {{separately}} from the list-mode file, and then reconstructed into an eight-gate time-static image, involving the manual submission of 40 list-mode sorting or reconstruction assignments on the PET/CT reconstruction console and reconstruction of 160 image sets in total. Then, the 20 gated images were imported in a Matlab tool for resorting them into eight dynamic single cardiac-gate scans of 20 frames each, after which parametric images were calculated {{as described in the}} “Methods” section above. Aside from being very labour-intensive and time-consuming, this amount of manual processing is vulnerable to operator errors. Ideally, the scanner post-processing unit should automate the list-mode sorting, reconstruction and re-sorting into dynamic gated single cardiac-gated images, preferably using a frame timing definition that corresponds to full cardiac cycles. The software used for blood volume analysis originates from SPECT and has not been validated for <b>synthetic</b> PET <b>blood</b> volume images, but seems to provide reasonable results. If the software used for blood volume analysis would accommodate this, only end-systolic and end-diastolic single-gate dynamic images would need to be reconstructed.

40|$|This volume, a {{collection}} with contributions {{from some of}} the major scholars of the Gothic in literature and culture, reflects on how recent Gothic studies have foregrounded a plethora of technologies associated with Gothic literary and cultural production. The engaging essays look into the links between technologies and the proliferation of the Gothic seen in an excess of Gothic texts and tropes: Frankensteinesque experiments, the manufacture of <b>synthetic</b> (true?) <b>blood,</b> Moreauesque hybrids, the power of the Borg, Dr Jekyll’s chemical experimentations, the machinery of Steampunk, or the corporeal modifications of Edward Scissorhands. Further, they explore how techno-science has contributed to the proliferation of the Gothic: Gothic in social media, digital technologies, the on-line gaming and virtual Goth/ic communities, the special effects of Gothic-horror cinema. Contributors address how Gothic technologies have, in a general sense, produced and perpetuated ideologies and influenced the politics of cultural practice, asking significant questions: How has the technology of the Gothic contributed to the writing of self and other? How have Gothic technologies been gendered, sexualized, encrypted, coded or de-coded? How has the Gothic manifested itself in new technologies across diverse geographical locations? This volume explores how Gothic technologies textualize identities and construct communities within a complex network of power relations in local, national, transnational, and global contexts. It will be of interest to scholars of the literary Gothic, extending beyond to include fascinating interventions into the areas of cultural studies, popular culture, science fiction, film, and TV...|$|R

Unfortunately, this alternative, like the natural blood, has a limited shelf life at room temperature due to thermal and/or solar (optical) radiations exposure. In this study experiments were run on LEH assays, with and without protection additives, to weigh up the effect of exposing LEH to thermal effect, using a digital controlled oven, and to optical radiations, using an appropriate apparatus to simulate the solar optical radiations. Constant evaluation of the acceptability of this artificial blood alternative was done with the help of an advanced computerized technique. The results of the experiment have shown that exposing LEH to thermal and optical radiations leads to a reduction of the concentration of the oxyhemoglobin and a heightened of the concentration of the methemoglobin. The rate of LEH degra dation in the two treatments was linked to the time in which they were exposed both to the thermal and optical radiations effects. Antioxidants, ascorbic acid and alfa-tocopherol were used in order to conserve and guard the prepared LEH from the degradation that happens to it due to the effects of both thermal and optical radiations. تصلح كريات الدم الحمراء المصنعة المعروفة باسم ل. ا. هـ كبديل ممتاز في عمليات نقل الدم ، وهى منافس جيد لنقل الأوكسجين ، تماما كما تفعل كريات الدم الحمراء الطبيعية،. ولكن للأسف فان هذا البديل الصناعي يشبه الدم الطبيعي في قصر مدة الحياة عندما يحفظ على الرف في درجة حرارة الغرفة العادية، وذلك نظرا لتأثره بالإشعاع الحرارى والضوئي. في هذه الدراسة تم عمل تحاليل حول عمل كريات الدم الحمراء المصنعة، مع وبدون اضافات للحماية...|$|R
