Just as Nintendo 64 predecessors Pokémon Stadium and Pokémon Stadium 2 had served as home console counterparts to the first- and second-generation handheld titles, Colosseum had a similar role for the third generation.|$|E
5|$|Sinclair {{worked with}} musicians {{including}} Fernando Garibay, Jeff Bhasker, and Martin Kierszenbaum, {{and created a}} concept album based on perfectionism. Its lyrical content contains references to love, sex, and money, complemented by a <b>sonority</b> rooted in synthpop, dance-pop and dark pop. Perfectionist received mixed reviews from music critics, who asserted that the singer's visual projects were superior to her music. Obtaining top 50 positions in some European countries, the album performed moderately on international record charts. In the United Kingdom and United States, the set attained chiefly low positions; in the latter, its sales as of September 2013 were of 14,000 copies.|$|E

25|$|Lenition {{involves}} {{changes in}} manner of articulation, sometimes accompanied by {{small changes in}} place of articulation. There are two main lenition pathways: opening and sonorization. In both cases, a stronger sound becomes a weaker one. Lenition {{can be seen as}} a movement on the <b>sonority</b> hierarchy from less sonorous to more sonorous, or on a strength hierarchy from stronger to weaker.|$|E
25|$|The {{soundboard}} (Göğüs) is a rotund thin (2.5–3mm) flat three-, two- or single-piece {{plate of}} resonant wood (usually Nordmann, silver or Greek fir). This circular plate measuring about 30 to 35cm in diameter {{is mounted on}} the bottom wedge and the heel with simmering glue and encircled with a wooden ring. A soundhole is either wanting or consists of a very small unornamented opening (mostly in historical specimens), giving the instrument its peculiar <b>sonority.</b>|$|E
25|$|The First Piano Sonata in F minor, Op. 5, is a four-movement {{work from}} 1901–3 {{suggesting}} {{the style of}} Scriabin or Rachmaninoff, but nonetheless original. Medtner's craft gained subtlety and complexity in later years, but this work is already evidence of his mastery of musical structure. An opening Allegro, dramatic and imbued like much Russian music with a bell-like <b>sonority,</b> is separated by a Intermezzo from a Largo divoto that reaches a Maestoso climax before plunging into the headlong Allegro risoluto finale.|$|E

50|$|The second movement, a slow threnody in arch form, {{opens with}} clangorous <b>sonorities,</b> before {{revealing}} a main theme full of noble character. After the thunderous climax {{in the central}} section, reflective horns call out a nostalgic melody, later {{to be accompanied by}} the music-box sounds of the celesta and harp. The noble melody returns and the movement ends with the same clangorous <b>sonorities</b> as it had begun with.|$|R

25|$|Skempton's {{style is}} characterised by a {{concentration}} on quality {{of sound and}} economy of means, absence of development in the conventional sense, and concentration on <b>sonority.</b> Many of his pieces are quite short, lasting no longer {{than one or two}} minutes. Although the compositional methods are clearly experimental, involving, for example, aleatory methods, there is a marked emphasis on the melody in many pieces. Some of his earlier piano works, such as Saltaire Melody (1977) and Trace (1980), have become favourites with the public.|$|E
25|$|Her {{secret is}} in her ability to {{transfer}} to the musical plane {{the suffering of the}} character she plays, the nostalgic longing for lost happiness, the anxious fluctuation between hope and despair, between pride and supplication, between irony and generosity, which in the end dissolve into a superhuman inner pain. The most diverse and opposite of sentiments, cruel deceptions, ambitious desires, burning tenderness, grievous sacrifices, all the torments of the heart, acquire in her singing that mysterious truth, I would like to say, that psychological <b>sonority,</b> which is the primary attraction of opera.|$|E
25|$|To a large extent, Bach's musical style fits in the {{conventions}} of his day, which is {{the final stage of}} the baroque style. When his contemporaries, such as Handel, Telemann and Vivaldi wrote concertos he did so too. When they wrote suites, he did so too. Similar with recitatives followed by da capo arias, four-part choral music, use of basso continuo etc. The specifics of his style lie with characteristics such as his skill in contrapuntal invention and motivic control and his talent for writing tightly woven music of powerful <b>sonority.</b> From an early age, he imbued himself with the compositions of his contemporaries and of prior generations, all of what was available from European composers, such as the French, the Italian, and those from all parts of Germany, and there is little of it that didn't appear in his own music.|$|E

25|$|Until his sixties Tal {{appeared}} as a pianist and conductor with various orchestras, but his major contribution to the music world lies in his challenging compositions and his novel use of <b>sonority.</b> In the 1990s Tal conducted, together with Dr Shlomo Markel, a research project (Talmark) aimed at {{the development of a}} novel musical notation system in cooperation with the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, and VolkswagenStiftung. During these years his eyesight deteriorated due to macular degeneration and it became increasingly difficult for him to continue composing. Using a computer screen to enlarge the music score, he managed to compose short musical works for few instruments, write his third autobiography, and complete his visionary analysis of future music. The complete cycle of his symphonies conducted by Israel Yinon was released on the German label CPO.|$|E
500|$|A {{consonant}} {{closer to}} the main vowel must have a higher <b>sonority</b> than the consonant further away.
