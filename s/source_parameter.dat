40|$|Understanding {{the physics}} of {{earthquake}} rupture is critical to providing accurate estimates of seismic hazard and for effectively mitigating these hazards. Matching physical models to seismic data {{in order to better}} understand the earthquake rupture processes requires accurate and precise estimates of earthquake source properties. Measuring source properties such as rupture size and stress drop must include accounting for the effects of seismic wave propagation and making proper assumptions about the rupture process. This thesis focuses on the methods of estimating source properties of small earthquakes and on the application of these methods to earthquakes in two distinctly different seismogenic regions of California. In the San Jacinto Fault Zone, earthquakes recorded by a small aperture array allow quantification of <b>source</b> <b>parameter</b> uncertainties using empirical Green's functions and frequency-domain techniques. These uncertainties are frequently overlooked in <b>source</b> <b>parameter</b> estimation, and this study constrains them to ̃ 30 % of estimate values. A non-parametric time- domain method using a set of empirical Green's functions is described and applied to a series of example earthquakes. This approach minimizes the assumptions regarding the rupture process and can be used to study less simple ruptures. Correcting for the effects of seismic wave propagation is an important aspect of techniques used in <b>source</b> <b>parameter</b> estimation, and the conditions necessary to effectively use nearby earthquakes as path corrections are tested and quantified. At the San Andreas Fault near Parkfield, the high degree of waveform similarity among closely spaced earthquakes is used to apply spatially averaged propagation path corrections and search for rupture directivity effects. This analysis shows that the population of small earthquakes in this region does not have a consistent unilateral rupture direction, but 70 % of M> 3 earthquakes exhibit characteristics of southeast-directed rupture. Computational models featuring a fault interface separating two materials for Parkfield-like conditions agree with the preferential southeast-directed rupture and present potential implications for earthquake source physics. Combined, these studies of earthquake <b>source</b> <b>parameter</b> estimation can be used to improve future <b>source</b> <b>parameter</b> estimates, offer appropriate metrics for establishing uncertainty bounds, and contribute to the study of earthquake source physic...|$|E

30|$|Both the IPF and PLUM methods {{exhibited}} {{better performance}} for the multiple simultaneous earthquakes that resulted in over-predicted warnings in the current method. In the IPF method, the classification algorithm using the observed velocity amplitude improved its ability to discriminate between earthquake occurrences. In addition, hypocenter determinations using not-yet-arrived data enhanced the robustness of the <b>source</b> <b>parameter</b> estimates when the classification of trigger data was partially incorrect. Introducing many types of data other than arrival time {{seems to be a}} promising approach for minimizing over-predictions related to <b>source</b> <b>parameter</b> estimation. In the PLUM method, small multiple simultaneous earthquakes pose no serious problems since such earthquakes only generate small real-time seismic intensities not targeted by the PLUM method, which implies that the PLUM method is sufficiently robust for multiple simultaneous earthquakes.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{empirical}} Green's functions (EGF) {{technique is}} used to investigate two methods for predicting ground motion in a sedimentary basin for a future earthquake, including variability assessment. This study focuses on the Grenoble basin (French Alps). The basic principle of both methods is to generate a variety of <b>source</b> <b>parameter</b> sets based on a grid testing approach. Next, these sets are used to compute a population of ground motions {{by means of a}} kinematic EGF method and to estimate ground-motion variability. The first method tried, called the direct-parameter-input approach, selects input parameter combinations from assumed <b>source</b> <b>parameter</b> probability density functions. It is demonstrated that this approach leads to overestimated variability. Moreover, these simulation results are not calibrated. A new (screened-parameter-input) procedure is therefore proposed: (1) reference rock site response spectra are simulated for fractiles of several orders using empirical ground-motion prediction equations; (2) a large population of rock site response spectra is generated by means of the EGF method with varying rupture parameter combinations; (3) the spectra that do not fit the empirical motion for the chosen fractiles are screened out and sets of permissible <b>source</b> <b>parameter</b> combinations are thus obtained; (4) sediment site response spectra are computed with this EGF procedure and with these permissible parameter combinations; and (5) for each frequency median spectral acceleration and standarddeviation values are derived...|$|E

40|$|The {{broadband}} seismic {{network in}} the European–Mediterranean area provides high-quality data. We invert these regional three-component data for the source parameters of moderate-to-strong earthquakes in the entire European–Mediterranean area. Regional seismograms have a good signal-to-noise ratio even for moderate-sized events that are too small for teleseismic analysis. The magnitude threshold for <b>source</b> <b>parameter</b> determination can, thus, be significantly lowered. The threshold depends on the average event–station distances. Within dense broadband networks, we analyze MW≈ 3. 0 earthquakes. In areas far from broadband seismic stations, the lower bound is MW≈ 4. 5 – 4. 8, still considerably lower than the teleseismic analysis threshold (about MW≈ 5. 0 – 5. 3). For larger events, we perform rapid moment tensor analysis using near-real-time data; solutions are posted within hours after event occurrence. In a second step, we merge near-real-time and later available data to obtain a regional moment tensor catalog of moderate-to-large earthquakes for the entire European–Mediterranean area. Within less than 1 year, we have analyzed 67 earthquakes {{ranging in size from}} MW= 2. 9 to 7. 5. The solutions cover the seismically active areas of the European–Mediterranean area. Particularly important are solutions for slowly deforming regions where large earthquakes, that could be analyzed with teleseismic data, occur infrequently. The solutions are reliable: for events with independent <b>source</b> <b>parameter</b> estimates, the agreement is generally high. The solutions are robust: variations in epicentral parameters, source depth, or exact choice of stations do not affect <b>source</b> <b>parameter</b> estimates strongly.
