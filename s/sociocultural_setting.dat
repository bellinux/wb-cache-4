Quality of life interview (QOLI), a commonly used instrument in the West {{has not been}} used in a developing country like India.

40|$|Aim To {{highlight}} {{the importance of}} combining the geographies of sociocultural adaptation and biodiversity risk for creating global change conservation strategies. Location Global. Methods:  We review global conservation adaptation strategies and the geographies that influence biological risk, as well as <b>sociocultural</b> capacity to <b>set</b> priorities for a conservation response. We then describe relationships among these geographies and discuss criteria for prioritizing areas that will have the greatest potential for effective adaptive action. Results: Strategic conservation requires integrating biological geographies with physical and cultural geographies to maximize potential success with limited resources. Main conclusions: Biogeography is important for strategic conservation, {{but it is not}} the only geography that matters. There is a physical geography of global change providing a complex backdrop against which biodiversity is responsive. Additionally, there is a human geography that drives the degree of threat through variations in anthropogenic disturbance of natural systems and also drives variation in potential mitigation through sociocultural capacity for conservation action. Conservation biogeography typically considers the physical geography of change and the biogeography of threat; it must expand to consider the sociocultural geography of intervention, negative and positive, if it is to be effective. Consideration of these varying geographies also drives different choices for how to implement conservation strategies...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the processes of <b>sociocultural</b> change <b>set</b> in motion when the Aboriginal people of the Edward River reserve gave up their hunter-gatherer lifestyle and joined with Anglican missionaries to form the Edward River settlement in 1938. In opting for a sedentary life, the Aborigines of the reserve were consciously adopting the role of culture recipients who were dependent on change agents (missionaries, and later government officials) from the mainstream Australian society to provide the sources for socio-cultural change as well as the direction in which it should proceed. The cultural patterns characterising reserve life prior to the establishment of the settlement are reconstructed from informants' memories and the observations of anthropologists who conducted studies among the reserve's peoples between 1925 and 1935. The pre-settlement patterns are then compared with those which characterised settlement life in the period 1968 - 75 when the author undertook his fieldwork. Two independently formulated hypotheses concerning the degree, direction and sources of socio-cultural change are tested against the actual course of events. The first hypothesis was developed by an anthropologist, Lauriston Sharp, who {{on the basis of his}} investigations into the totemic ideology of the Yir Yoront, came to the conclusion that sustained contact between the people of the reserve and European Australians would lead to the collapse of the indigenous cultural system. The second hypothesis was implicit in Queensland state Government policy and legislation. It stated that the Aboriginal people of the Edward River settlement could be transformed over time from a welfare-dependent, managed community to one that was just like a normal country town in Queensland by providing physical amenities similar to those of country towns, and by imposing routines and social structure: similar to those found in the economic systems and formal processes of social control in the dominant society. Neither hypothesis has accurately anticipated the real outcome. Aboriginal belief systems have not collapsed nor have the people of Edward River achieved that level of cultural competence that would permit them to manage their community without help. It is argued in this thesis that the first hypothesis failed because of an anthropological interpretation that over-emphasized the comprehensiveness of the indigenous totemic ideology and thus understated the resilience of Edward River belief systems. It is argued that the second hypothesis concerning the appropriate techniques for inducing change is also failing despite the commitment of the Edward River people to the development of their community. Edward River people have adapted to their institutional environment in such a way as to preserve some fundamental Aboriginal values, and to create a permanent niche for outside managers. There seems little prospect for change in this situation unless certain prerequisites to fruitful socio-cultural change are incorporated in basic planning strategies...|$|R

40|$|Chick lit, a subgenre {{of women}} 2 ̆ 7 s fiction, has been commercially popular for a decade, yet {{academic}} analyses are scant and often confined to discussions {{of a single}} text. This dissertation investigates chick lit as a genre {{as well as an}} overlooked source of <b>sociocultural</b> commentary. I <b>set</b> up a literary historical framework to examine chick lit 2 ̆ 7 s reworking of major narrative traditions, and, in conjunction, use chick lit as a lens through which to view gender relations in U. S. and British society in the 1990 s. In each chapter I approach chick lit in a different way [...] -as a realistic parody of Harlequin romance, as a female Bildungsroman employing novel of manners classics as frequent intertexts, and as a counter-paradigm, at times backlash, to feminism [...] -in order to piece together different pieces of its origins and popularity. Together these chapters provide a history of conditions in publishing, consumer culture, and heterosexual courtship that have coalesced to produce this genre of veiled memoir. I draw on texts from both literary history and popular media: chick lit novels themselves, journalism, online discussion forums, author websites and interviews, industry advertisements, and lifestyle periodicals. I conclude that while chick lit was supposed to be, according to journalist Anna Weinberg, 2 ̆ 2 the bright light of postfeminist writing, 2 ̆ 2 it is now a historical component of postmodernism 2 ̆ 7 s fin de siècle. Despite a myopic social vision, these urban period pieces bring to the contemplative tradition of the novel of manners elements of adventure fiction; they extend Jane Austen 2 ̆ 7 s comedic legacy; and they rework Edith Wharton 2 ̆ 7 s treatment of courtship into semi-comedic form. Chick lit has monumentally changed the representation of single women in literature by portraying not figures of pity, illness, or derision, but a cast of funny, usually capable women not looking to settle. Chick lit 2 ̆ 7 s humor belies an ambitious amalgamation of literary and popular forms, regardless of whether the ultimate product betrays solipsism and limited literary ability. Though imparting more social commentary than criticism, chick lit has established humorous fiction for women as a full-fledged literary category. ...|$|R

40|$|Successful {{climate change}} {{mitigation}} will involve not only technological innovation, but also innovation in how we understand the societal and individual behaviors that shape the demand for energy services. Traditionally, individual energy behaviors {{have been described as}} a function of utility optimization and behavioral economics, with price restructuring as the dominant policy lever. Previous research at the macro-level has identified economic activity, power generation and technology, and economic role as significant factors that shape energy use. However, most demand models lack basic contextual information on how dominant social phenomenon, the changing demographics of cities, and the <b>sociocultural</b> <b>setting</b> within which people operate, affect energy decisions and use patterns. Here we use high-quality Suomi-NPP VIIRS nighttime environmental products to: (1) observe aggregate human behavior through variations in energy service demand patterns during the Christmas and New Year's season and the Holy Month of Ramadan and (2) demonstrate that patterns in energy behaviors closely track sociocultural boundaries at the country, city, and district level. These findings indicate that energy decision making and demand is a sociocultural process as well as an economic process, often involving a combination of individual price-based incentives and societal-level factors. While nighttime satellite imagery has been used to map regional energy infrastructure distribution, tracking daily dynamic lighting demand at three major scales of urbanization is novel. This methodology can enrich research on the relative importance of drivers of energy demand and conservation behaviors at fine scales.

40|$|Background: Pattern of {{substance}} use, profile {{of substance}} users, and treatment-seeking differ across cultures and continents. These differences could potentially affect the pattern and perhaps prevalence of dual diagnosis. However, {{the study of}} dual diagnosis from de-addiction clinics in India is limited in number and methodology. In this study, we report the prevalence and patterns of psychiatric disorders in subjects attending a de-addiction clinic in a teaching hospital in Srinagar, Kashmir. Methodology: In this cross-sectional study, 300 subjects (> 18 years of age) seeking treatment for substance use disorders were screened with Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Plus {{for the presence of}} psychiatric comorbidity. Subjects were assessed after 4 weeks of complete abstinence from psychoactive substances. Results: Cannabis (26 %) was the most common single-use substance. It was followed by polysubstance use (22. 3 %) and opioids (21. 3 %). Among the 300 subjects assessed for the purpose of the study, 174 (58 %) were found to have dual diagnosis. Psychotic disorders (34 %) were the most common psychiatric comorbidity, and it was followed by major depressive disorder (16 %) and bipolar affective disorder (16 %). Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was present in 20 (11. 5 %) subjects. When the groups with or without dual diagnosis were compared, cannabis and benzodiazepine dependence was found to be significantly common in the dual diagnosis group. Conclusions: A high prevalence of dual diagnoses, especially psychotic disorders and also PTSD, in our predominantly cannabis-using subjects attending hospital located in a distinct <b>sociocultural</b> <b>setting</b> in India, highlights the importance of taking into consideration the sociocultural context in which substance use as well as dual diagnoses should be understood...|$|E
40|$|The thesis explores {{issues in}} the writing {{development}} of primary school children where drama {{was used as a}} teaching and learning pedagogy. It is based on a case study carried out in 2005 - 2006 in a Greek primary school Y 4 class in Cyprus where the author was teaching and investigates the nature and relationship of the two processes when used together. The project involved twenty drama sessions (over six months), each followed by a writing task that stemmed from the contents and children’s participation in drama. The overall aim was to describe ‘what happens when drama is integrated in a writing classroom’. Informed by the Vygotskian theory of learning, it sought to investigate the impact of using drama on children’s: (a) attitudes and views towards writing, (b). engagement with writing tasks and (c) quality of writing. A qualitative case study methodology and multi-method approach to the design of the study were adopted {{on the basis of what}} can best investigate the issues raised by the research questions. Questionnaires, interviews, observations, writing samples, video recordings and researcher’s log were used to collect data throughout the year, before (Sept-Dec) and after (Jan-Jun) drama integration in writing lessons. The collected data were analysed by quantitative and qualitative methods. Findings indicated positive changes in children’s attitudes and views towards writing following the introduction of drama and progressively positive improvements in most children’s engagement in writing. Additionally, analysis of writing samples provided indications of positive contribution of drama towards children’s writing and insights into the interaction between drama and writing content. On a theoretical level, this thesis suggests that the concept of mediation is central in interpreting the interactive relationship between drama and writing. It also indicates the impact of drama as a <b>sociocultural</b> <b>setting</b> on children’s agency in their development as writers and raises questions for further research.

40|$|Background: There is a {{need for}} valid and {{comprehensive}} measures of parental influence on children ’ s energy balance-related behaviours (EBRB). Such measures should be based on a theoretical framework, acknowledging the dynamic and complex nature of interactions occurring within a family. The aim of the Family & Dietary habits (F&D) project was to develop a conceptual framework identifying important and changeable family processes influencing dietary behaviours of 13 – 15 year olds. A second aim was to develop valid and reliable questionnaires for adolescents and their parents (both mothers and fathers) measuring these processes. Methods: A stepwise approach was used; (1) preparation of scope and structure, (2) development of the F&D questionnaires, (3) the conducting of pilot studies and (4) the conducting of validation studies (assessing internal reliability, test-retest reliability and confirmatory factor analysis) using data from a cross-sectional study. Results: The conceptual framework includes psychosocial concepts such as family functioning, cohesion, conflicts, communication, work-family stress, parental practices and parental style. The physical characteristics of the home environment include accessibility and availability of different food items, while family meals are the <b>sociocultural</b> <b>setting</b> included. Individual characteristics measured are dietary intake (vegetables and sugar-sweetened beverages) and adolescents ’ impulsivity. The F&D questionnaires developed were tested in a test-retest (54 adolescents and 44 of their parents) and in a cross-sectional survey including 440 adolescents (13 – 15 year olds), 242 mothers and 155 fathers. The samples appear to be relatively representative for Norwegian adolescents and parents. For adolescents, mothers and fathers, the test-retest reliability of the dietary intake, frequencies of (family) meals, work-family stress and communication variables was satisfactory (ICC: 0. 53 - 0. 99). Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-Brief (BIS-Brief) was included, assessing adolescent’s impulsivity. The internal reliability (Cronbach’s alphas: 0. 77 / 0. 82) and test-retest reliability values (ICC: 0. 74 / 0. 77) of BIS-Brief were good. Conclusions: The conceptual framework developed may be a useful tool in guiding measurement and assessment of the home food environment and family processes related to adolescents’ dietary habits, in particular and for EBRBs more generally. The results support the use of the F&D questionnaires as psychometrically sound tools to assess family characteristics and adolescent’s impulsivity...|$|E
40|$|Human {{support has}} been widely studied {{in the context of}} {{traditional}} classroom or practitioner teaching-learning situations in which tutors support pedagogically those being tutored, sometimes referred to as tutees.

On the other hand, somewhat less research has been conducted on human support in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) situations (but see Ashton, Roberts & Teles, 1999; Graesser, Person, Harter,& The Tutoring Research Group, 2001; Graesser, Person, & Magliano, 1995; Hudson, 1999, 1997; Kaptelinin & Cole, 1997; Katz, O'Donnell, & Kay, 2000; Light, Colbourn, & Light, 1997; Pilkington, Treasure-Jones, & Kneser, 1999; Rasku-Puttonen, Eteläpelto, & Arvaja, 1999; Schlager & Schank, 1997).

It is aimed both at researchers and practitioners, the latter being either teachers using CSCL or CSCL designers and programmers. It will be shown that in spite of the theoretical underpinnings of CSCL stressing the importance of co-construction in learning (Baker & Lund, 1997) and the unit of analysis as being the <b>sociocultural</b> <b>setting</b> in which activities are embedded (Kirshner & Whitson, 1997) human support is most widely represented in the literature in a quite limited sense. Firstly, it is portrayed most often solely from the tutor's point of view (Chi et al., 2001) and not as an inherent part of a co-constructed interaction (but see Derry et al. (in press), for a counter example). Secondly human support is generally seen as being given by tutors to tutees, and is not portrayed as often in other CSCL participant combinations (e. g., support given by students to students), although certain forms of peer collaboration can be seen as support and is often referred to as co-construction in the CSCL and more generally cooperative learning literature (Plety, 1996) ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} issue of men 2 ̆ 7 s access to chronic illness self {{management}} programs from a social constructionist perspective. A combination of research methodologies was used; a quantitative analysis to confirm gender differences in levels and patterns of service use; a qualitative analysis to gain an increased understanding of the factors affecting men 2 ̆ 7 s access; and a trial to test {{the application of the}} research findings. The clients and services of Arthritis Victoria were chosen as the setting for this research. The quantitative analyses were conducted on contingency tables and odds ratios and confirmed that men were under-represented as service users. The analyses also identified gender differences in patterns of service use. The qualitative analysis was based on a series of in-depth, semi-structured interviews. It was undertaken from a grounded theory approach to allow for the development of theoretical explanations grounded in the data. It was found that men 2 ̆ 7 s decisions to access chronic illness self management programs were strongly influenced by dominant social constructions of masculinity which constrained help-seeking and health management behaviour. However, the restrictive influence of hegemonic masculinity was progressively undermined by the increasing severity of the chronic condition until a crisis point was reached in terms of the severity of the condition or its impact on lifestyle. This resulted in a reformulation or rejection of hegemonic masculinity. The described conceptual framework was consistent for men from diverse social groupings, although it appeared less prominent in both younger and older men, suggesting that dominant social constructions of masculinity have the greatest influence on health decisions during the middle stage of adulthood when work and family obligations are greatest. The thesis findings informed the development of some guiding principles for reviewing the structure and delivery of chronic illness self management services for men. The guiding principles will have direct application in the planning of Arthritis Victoria programs, and implications for other chronic illness self management programs in Australia, and also in Western countries with a similar health and <b>sociocultural</b> <b>setting</b> to Australia...|$|E
40|$|Young {{people often}} {{tend to be}} {{depicted}} either as a risk factor or passive victim. Few youth have the possibilities to actively take part in decision-making processes affecting their lives. However, researchers increasingly criticize this oversimplified view of young people and stress the significance of involving them in social transformation processes. A first step {{to do so is}} to consider young people’s interpretation and assessment of the world. Thus, the present research project aims at giving voice to a certain group of young people we hardly hear, namely street-living adolescents in Cusco, Peru, regarding two particular social issues: peace and violence. How do these adolescents conceptualize ‘peace’ and ‘violence’? To find answers to this proposition, individual semi-structured interviews were conducted in combination with the creation of drawings. The empirical findings revealed a three-folded peace concept, which can be systemized as ‘Three Dimensions of Peace. ’ The street adolescents regard peace not just as the opposite of war or other types of overt violence. Their understanding combines elements that might be ascribed to either ‘typically’ occidental or oriental ideas about peace. As a result, the ‘Three Dimensions of Peace’ as understood by the youths complement existing peace theories. Previous research regarding young people’s conception of violence and peace frequently made use of the cognitive-developmental approach. This study’s interest, however, is chiefly centered on the individual’s relation with the sociocultural environment and its affect on ideas about peace and violence. In accordance with the socialization and ecological perspectives, {{it can be argued that}} the youth’s understanding of these concepts is influenced by their interactions with the immediate surroundings and by the wider <b>sociocultural</b> <b>setting.</b> Therefore, this research project additionally explores the street youths’ conceptualizations in relation to their specific cultural background and social reality. So as to collect information about their socialcultural context, supplementary interviews were carried out with adults who are experienced in working directly with the street adolescents. Due to the relation between the youths’ social knowledge and their particular social experiences and interactions with their immediate and wider surroundings, the three-folded peace concept gives an idea about the Cusquenian adolescents’ perspective of changes that have to be undertaken in their environment in order to improve their own lives but also to achieve a greater level of peacefulness for the whole Peruvian society...|$|E
40|$|This {{article was}} {{originally}} published in International journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity under a CC BY license; doi: 10. 1186 /s 12966 - 014 - 0130 -zBackground: There {{is a need for}} valid and comprehensive measures of parental influence on children ’ s energy balance-related behaviours (EBRB). Such measures should be based on a theoretical framework, acknowledging the dynamic and complex nature of interactions occurring within a family. The aim of the Family & Dietary habits (F&D) project was to develop a conceptual framework identifying important and changeable family processes influencing dietary behaviours of 13 – 15 year olds. A second aim was to develop valid and reliable questionnaires for adolescents and their parents (both mothers and fathers) measuring these processes. Methods: A stepwise approach was used; (1) preparation of scope and structure, (2) development of the F&D questionnaires, (3) the conducting of pilot studies and (4) the conducting of validation studies (assessing internal reliability, test-retest reliability and confirmatory factor analysis) using data from a cross-sectional study. Results: The conceptual framework includes psychosocial concepts such as family functioning, cohesion, conflicts, communication, work-family stress, parental practices and parental style. The physical characteristics of the home environment include accessibility and availability of different food items, while family meals are the <b>sociocultural</b> <b>setting</b> included. Individual characteristics measured are dietary intake (vegetables and sugar-sweetened beverages) and adolescents ’ impulsivity. The F&D questionnaires developed were tested in a test-retest (54 adolescents and 44 of their parents) and in a cross-sectional survey including 440 adolescents (13 – 15 year olds), 242 mothers and 155 fathers. The samples appear to be relatively representative for Norwegian adolescents and parents. For adolescents, mothers and fathers, the test-retest reliability of the dietary intake, frequencies of (family) meals, work-family stress and communication variables was satisfactory (ICC: 0. 53 - 0. 99). Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-Brief (BIS-Brief) was included, assessing adolescent’s impulsivity. The internal reliability (Cronbach’s alphas: 0. 77 / 0. 82) and test-retest reliability values (ICC: 0. 74 / 0. 77) of BIS-Brief were good. Conclusions: The conceptual framework developed may be a useful tool in guiding measurement and assessment of the home food environment and family processes related to adolescents’ dietary habits, in particular and for EBRBs more generally. The results support the use of the F&D questionnaires as psychometrically sound tools to assess family characteristics and adolescent’s impulsivity...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to problematise the social {{practice}} of school-university collaboration in the context of assessment reform in Hong Kong English Language teaching. Hong Kong’s education system has been undergoing major reforms since 1997 and collaboration between tertiary institutions and schools has been negotiated in education policy discourse as a way to improve teaching and learning. In the key policy documents shaping professional development practices for Hong Kong teachers, school-university collaboration is neatly packaged as achievable and unproblematic. In reality, however, school-university collaboration is frequently characterised by tensions and complexities. The objective of this research is to critically examine how particular worldviews about school-university collaboration and partnership are negotiated, reproduced and/or contested in one particular sociocultural context, that of secondary English language teaching in Hong Kong. Drawing on the work of Michel Foucault and the concepts of discourse propounded by Norman Fairclough, a theoretical framework was constructed to examine how collaborative practices in this case study were constituted through discourse. Textual data were collected from the case study. Critical discourse analysis (CDA) was used to examine how teacher-researchers and university facilitators co-constructed and negotiated systems of beliefs and knowledge, interpersonal relations and intrapersonal subjectivity whilst engaged in collaborative action research (CAR). The analysis of the textual data (emails, interviews, transcripts of face-to-face meetings) revealed collaborative practices were mediated through language (verbal and non-verbal). The study also indicates that the collaboration enacted in this case study was highly complex and ambiguous because the practice was predominantly shaped by social, political, ideological and pragmatic factors in the wider sociocultural context, including changes in the assessment of speaking skills of senior secondary students in the English language education curriculum. The discourse of collaboration was thus problematised to identify how all these factors shaped the construction of beliefs, interpersonal relations and identity in the practice of collaborative action research. The study concludes with an examination of the contribution that critical discourse analysis research can make in problematising the practice of school-university collaboration, and how this knowledge may be able to improve the planning and facilitation of future practices. While the existing literature about collaborative action research provides educators with information on how it is implemented in a Western sociocultural context, there are fewer studies which examine the notion of school-university collaboration in a more critical light, for example, by exploring how systemic and contextual factors in society play a significant role in shaping and constraining what people do through collaboration. This case study offers an insight into the complexities of constructing collaboration between two different institutional cultures in a non-Western <b>sociocultural</b> <b>setting.</b> The implications for policy, professional development and research in teacher education are also highlighted.

40|$|Avhandling (Ph. D.) - Norges musikkhøgskole, 2012 The {{research}} question {{addressed in this}} thesis was: How do beginners on a music instrument acquire music literacy in a music studio setting? The {{study was designed to}} identify and describe the learning strategies of 8 - 9 year old music school students by observing and interviewing them during their first year of instrumental lessons. The study of music literacy acquisition is in this thesis based on a sociocognitive view on literacy as a learning process, where knowledge acquisition is regarded as constructed, and learning seen as active meaning-making processes. In this perspective music literacy acquisition entails the ways the learner comprehends and learns both the culture, the ways of expressing meaning, how to use cultural tools, and the ways that the symbols are written and decoded. Four cases were chosen as an empirical base for the investigation: two trombone students and two flute students. I observed the students for a period of nine months, and interviewed them twice during their first year of instrumental lessons. The observations and interviews focused on learning strategies and literacy events. The data was transcribed and analysed using the computer based program NVivo, and a taxonomy of strategies was constructed in close dialog between the strategies that emerged from the empirical material, and strategy categories derived from research literature in language and music research. The study shows that the four students differed to a large degree in their use of strategies, both when it came to what strategies they used, and how many strategies they used. These differences were relatively consistent throughout the year. The strategies the students used were characterised by the meaning making attempts they did when they tried to make sense of both the <b>sociocultural</b> <b>setting</b> and the musical symbol system. They formed temporary perceptions of how the written music was to be understood and used. These were reconsidered by the students, adjusted, and negotiated along the way. The young learners didn’t seem to be uncomfortable with this temporary knowledge. The main strategy categories observed in the material were social strategies, cognitive strategies, memory related strategies, support strategies and listening strategies. Several of the students used support strategies to compensate for the lack of memory related strategies and cognitive strategies in their approaches to music literacy acquisition. Another aspect of the emergent literacy seen in this study is the multimodal ways that the children seem to approach a new symbol system. They expressed their meaning making through speech, gestures, songs, invented symbols, writings, language narratives, sounds and pictures. The study also showed that it is not enough for the teacher to tell the student what strategies that could be used; they have to be tried out and practised in order to be internalized as tools of learning. Teachers’ knowledge of how their students learn to comprehend written music will potentially affect students’ learning processes. This study illuminates this kind of knowledge through observations of beginner student’s behaviour, actions, and their thoughts of their own learning...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} study aims to explore tertiary TESOL teachers’ perspectives on their attitudes towards and engagement with professional development (PD) in an English language institute (ELI) {{at a university}} in Saudi Arabia. While there is a global recognition of PD {{as a vehicle for}} executing reforms and an increasing interest into how to better support the PD of in-service school teachers, there is also a need to further understanding about the influences on teachers’ engagement/disengagement in institutional PD initiatives. Informed by the basic qualitative approach, this study argues that it is important and indeed necessary to inquire into teachers’ views and experiences with workplace PD in order to deepen understanding about what influences TESOL teachers’ engagement/disengagement in workplace PD. This thesis therefore addresses an under researched topic about the influences on teachers’ engagement in institutional PD initiatives. To bridge this gap and contribute more broadly to an enriched understanding of the complexity of PD and teacher engagement in this, a three-dimension understanding of factors influencing teacher orientation to and engagement with workplace PD is employed; comprising micro (or individual teacher) factors, meso (or workplace/ institutional) factors, and macro factors such as <b>sociocultural</b> <b>setting</b> and wider discursive constructions of PD. The study employed individual semi-structured interviews with 12 teachers’ about their experiences of the professional development. Findings showed that teachers expressed negative perceptions about PD at the ELI. Unpacking this reveals a complex dynamic of conflictive discourses at the micro, meso and macro-levels. A number of themes emerged which describe teachers’ overwhelmingly negative views on PD in their workplace which are seen as completely the opposite of what they feel PD should comprise. Teachers experienced PD as policed and top-down within a wider culture of compliance at the ELI which leads them to feel professionally compromised and lacking in voice and autonomy. This culture of compliance is also seen to generate a culture of mistrust with consequences {{for the development of the}} teacher community and collaborative forms of PD. The study offers a richer and deepened understanding of teachers’ experiences with PD influenced by complex web of factors which impinge on their attitudes towards PD. It is argued that revealing this complexity is an important first step to transform institutional PD provision. The study also highlights how an examination of teacher learning as socially constructed requires that due attention must be paid to the understanding of the context in which it takes place, and the impact of this on how teachers engage with PD. Finally the study highlights the importance of understanding teacher and institution perspectives on PD as being informed by and taking place within certain discursive realities which highlight the significance of wider discourses of professionalism to the enactment and engagement with PD in the workplace. A number of recommendations for future research into PD in general and within the Saudi setting are proposed along with a number of practical steps to be taken at the ELI to help raise institutional awareness of effective PD and to encourage teachers to better engage with this.

40|$|The {{subjective}} {{sense of}} national identity is a complex psychological structure. At the cognitive level, it involves knowledge {{of the existence of}} the national group, knowledge of the national geographical territory, knowledge of the national emblems, customs, traditions, historical events and historical figures which symbolically represent the nation, beliefs about the typical characteristics of members of the national group, and beliefs about how similar the self is to the national type. At the affective level, the {{sense of national}} identity involves a subjective sense of belonging to the national community, feelings towards the people who make up the national group, numerous social emotions such as national pride and national shame, and an emotional attachment to the national homeland. The acquisition of this complex system of knowledge, beliefs and feelings takes place over a period of many years spanning both childhood and adolescence. At the University of Surrey, we have been conducting a systematic programme of research to investigate how this subjective sense of national identity develops during the course of childhood and adolescence. In a number of studies, we have found that children are able to talk about their membership of their own national group by 5 years of age. In addition, we have found that the importance which children attribute to their national identity increases significantly between 5 and 11 years of age. The degree of perceived similarity between the self and the national type also increases between these ages. We have further found that at 5 years of age, children often feel very positively about the people who belong to their own national group, and far less positively about foreigners. However, between 5 and 11 years of age, children's descriptions of the people who belong to their own national group gradually become less positive, as they begin to ascribe more variability and more negative traits to the members of their own national group. By contrast, across this same age range, children's descriptions of the people who belong to other national groups become more positive. These findings suggest that children's preference for their own national ingroup, and their prejudice against national outgroups, are at their strongest early in middle childhood, with the strength of these biases declining as children approach adolescence. In other studies, we have examined children's knowledge of national emblems and their knowledge of national geographical territory. For example, we have explored whether national geographical knowledge is related to the sense of national identity in children. Our studies here have revealed that national geographical knowledge increases significantly between 5 and 11 years of age, and that the amount of national geographical knowledge which children acquire is indeed positively correlated with their sense of national identity. Other findings have come from two cross-national programmes of research which are being coordinated from the University of Surrey. These research programmes are being conducted in collaboration with colleagues in Scotland, Spain, Italy, Russia, Ukraine, Georgia and Azerbaijan. In both of these larger studies, we have collected data from children and adolescents aged between 6 and 15 years old. By using cross-cultural designs, {{we have been able to}} identify those aspects of development which remain constant irrespective of the child's sociocultural context, and those aspects which vary as a function of context. We have found that ingroup favouritism, especially in young children, is a widespread phenomenon, irrespective of culture. In addition, some of the general age trends identified in our other studies (for example, the changes in the importance which is ascribed to national identity, and the changes in the perceived similarity between the self and the national type) do occur in most groups of children; however, these general age trends are exhibited to a different extent by different groups of children, apparently as a function of the specific sociocultural context in which the children are growing up. Furthermore, these differences in the development of different groups of children typically become more pronounced during adolescence. These findings imply that the development of national identity is driven not only by the cognitive changes which occur to the way in which the child is able to conceptualise the social world at different ages, but also by social influences. Thus, many of the changes which occur between 5 and 11 years of age are probably a consequence of the child's increasing ability across this age range to conceptualise large-scale social groups such as national groups. At the same time, however, the way in which even these cognitively-driven changes are expressed within any given child is modulated and affected by the specific <b>sociocultural</b> <b>setting</b> within which the child lives. We are currently expanding the focus of our research to include not only the development of national identity but also the development of ethnic and religious identity, in order to explore how these other identities impact upon the development of national identity in children. </p...|$|E
