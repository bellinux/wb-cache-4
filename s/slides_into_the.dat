In the episode Thumbelina's Wild Ride, Thumbelina (voiced by Debby Ryan with her singing voice {{provided}} by Shannon Chan-Kent) is hired to babysit for Goldie and Bear. The two friends are initially put off by her small stature, thinking she's almost helpless. When she tries getting the kids a snack, she falls down the kitchen sink and <b>slides</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> river behind the house. Goldie and Bear try to save her, but soon see that Thumbelina is resourceful, agile, and can lift several times her own weight. She saves herself from the river and even rescues the kids when they fall in trying to save her. The kids take an instant liking to Thumbellina and can't {{wait for the next}} time she babysits.|$|E
25|$|The {{wheel is}} usually {{similar to a}} bicycle wheel with a special hub {{designed}} so the axle is a fixed part of the hub. This means {{the rotation of the}} cranks directly controls the rotation of the wheel (called direct drive). The frame sits on top of the axle bearings, while the cranks attach {{to the ends of the}} axle, and the seatpost <b>slides</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> frame to allow the saddle to be height adjusted.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} {{version of the}} Pickett-Hamilton fort {{consists}} of two cylinders of pre-cast concrete each with one end closed. The slightly smaller of the two cylinders <b>slides</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> larger and they are kept apart by small guard rollers on the moving part that engaged with grooves. The structure is buried so that the overhanging top of the smaller cylinder lies flush with the ground. Closed in this position the pillbox is inconspicuous and allows aircraft and other vehicles to safely drive straight over it.|$|E
25|$|Some ambush predators build traps {{to capture}} their prey. Lacewings are a flying insect {{in the order}} Neuroptera. In some species, their larval form, known as the antlion, is an ambush predator. Eggs are laid in the earth, often in caves or under a rocky ledge. The {{juvenile}} creates a small, crater shaped trap. The antlion hides under a light cover of sand or earth. When an ant, beetle or other prey <b>slides</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> trap, the antlion grabs the prey with its powerful jaws.|$|E
25|$|The piston in {{the first}} stage is rigid and acts {{directly}} on the seat of the valve. The pressure in the intermediate pressure chamber drops when the diver inhales from the second stage valve, this causes the piston to lift off the stationary valve seat as the piston <b>slides</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> intermediate pressure chamber. The now open valve permits high pressure gas to flow into the medium pressure chamber until the pressure in the chamber has risen enough to push the piston back into its original position against the seat and thus close the valve.|$|E

500|$|... "Touch My Body" [...] rides a {{relatively}} restrained slow-dance groove, with some light, orchestral-synth flourishes thrown in. The rhythm is almost completely carried by an effortless keyboard bump, the easygoing repetitiveness of which eventually wears the listener down, and {{sets up a}} delicate frame for Carey to sing around. She pulls back when the song picks up the pace, and Carey keeps it simple here, playing with tempos rather than range. Indeed, she almost quietly <b>slides</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> chorus. [...] "If you run around and brag about this secret rendezvous, I will hunt you down", she sings, letting the last line trail off. But you don't necessarily believe her, as the feel is more playful that sinful.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics to}} [...] "Déjà Vu" [...] follow the verse–pre-chorus–chorus pattern, and feature two rap verses. It is hook-laden, similar {{in this respect}} to [...] "Crazy in Love". The lyrics detail a woman being {{constantly}} reminded of a past lover, shown in the lines, [...] "Is it because I'm missing you that I'm having déjà vu?" [...] As the song opens, Beyoncé introducing the bass, hi-hat and Roland TR-808 by name. The sounds of the instruments blend as they are being mentioned one after the other; the horns are only audible in the pre-chorus and hook sections, and a short section in the second rap. The bass guitar, {{which is the first}} instrument to enter, <b>slides</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> main two-bar ostinato. Following the repeated bass slides, the hi-hat and the Roland TR-808 begin playing.|$|E
500|$|The UK {{edition of}} Are You Experienced opened with [...] "Foxy Lady", a track that, with the {{exception}} of a few overdubs, was recorded in one session at CBS. Hendrix wrote the song about Heather Taylor, a highly desirable London socialite who later married the Who's Roger Daltrey. It begins with the fade-in of an F note that Hendrix is bending-up to F while applying generous finger vibrato. Using his guitar's control knob, he slowly increases volume until an audio feedback loop develops and he <b>slides</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> song's dominant Fm7 chord. Hendrix used a combination of natural amplifier overdrive and fuzz box effects units to create the song's razor-sharp guitar tone. Its blues–inspired solo—his fourth since arriving in England—used pentatonic scales while showcasing his innovative approach to melody; by exploiting the increased sustain created by overdriving his amplifiers, he moved seamlessly between the middle and high registers with a fluid, singing tone. While author Peter Doggett compared its slow beat to Memphis soul, David Stubbs described the track as a prototype for heavy metal bands such as Black Sabbath.|$|E

2500|$|The {{removal and}} fitting of {{cylinder}} liners in large engines requires {{the use of}} dry ice to chill and thus shrink the liner so that it freely <b>slides</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> engine block. When the liner then warms up, it expands, and the resulting interference fit holds it tightly in place. [...] Similar procedures may be used in fabricating mechanical assemblies with a high resultant strength, replacing the need for pins, keys or welds.|$|E
2500|$|There {{was some}} {{disagreement}} over Wilfork's role in causing the fumble. In the Patriots' postgame press conference, Wilfork recalled: [...] "I was just fighting pressure with pressure—knowing, seeing the ball went that way. I'm just taught to fight pressure with pressure, so I just started fighting back and knocked him into Sanchez and {{it created a}} fumble." [...] In NBC's television broadcast, immediately following the play, color commentator Cris Collinsworth said that [...] "Vince Wilfork just threw Brandon Moore into Mark Sanchez," [...] a view simultaneously echoed on the Patriots radio call by color analyst Scott Zolak. Moore disagreed with Collinsworth: [...] "when somebody <b>slides</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> back of you, you're going to fall. That happens a lot in general. You don't know what's going on (behind you)." [...] Responding to Moore, Collinsworth qualified his description {{in a phone interview}} with ESPN, saying that Wilfork could see the play develop, so [...] "instead of trying to go around Moore, he pushed him back into the play and made the whole thing happen." [...] A New York Daily News columnist sided with Moore, stating that [...] "A second look at the play shows Moore holding his own against Wilfork and moving, if anything, mostly forward." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{plant and}} take off is {{initiated}} typically three steps out from the final step. Vaulters will usually count their steps backwards from their starting point to the box only counting the steps taken on the left foot (vice versa for left-handers) except for the second step from the box, which is taken by the right foot. For example; a vaulter on a [...] "ten count" [...] (referring {{to the number of}} counted steps from the starting point to the box) would count backwards from ten, only counting the steps taken with the left foot, until the last three steps taken and both feet are counted as three, two, one. These last three steps are normally quicker than the previous strides and are referred to as the [...] "turn-over". The goal of this phase is to efficiently translate the kinetic energy accumulated from the approach into potential energy stored by the elasticity of the pole, and to gain as much initial vertical height as possible by jumping off the ground. The plant starts with the vaulter raising their arms up from around the hips or mid-torso until they are fully outstretched above the head, with the right arm extended directly above the head and the left arm extended perpendicular to the pole (vice versa for left-handed vaulters). At the same time, the vaulter is dropping the pole tip into the box. On the final step, the vaulter jumps off the trail leg which should always remain straight and then drives the front knee forward. As the pole <b>slides</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> back of the box the pole begins to bend and the vaulter continues up and forward, leaving the trail leg angled down and behind.|$|E

6000|$|The {{southern}} end of Grenada--of whatsoever rock it may be composed-- shows evidence of the same wave-destruction as do the Grenadines. [...] Arches and stacks, and low horizontal strata laid bare along the cliff, in some places white with guano, prove that the sea has been at work for ages, which must be many and long, considering that the surf, on that leeward side of the island, is little or none the whole year round. With these low cliffs, in strongest contrast to the stately and precipitous southern point of St. Lucia, the southern point of Grenada <b>slides</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sea, {{the last of the}} true Antilles.

6000|$|The mind is {{urged to}} ask for one cause of many effects; then {{for the cause of}} that; and again the cause, diving still into the profound; self-assured that it shall arrive at an {{absolute}} and sufficient one,--a one that shall be all. [...] "In the midst of the sun is the light, {{in the midst of the}} light is truth, and in the midst of truth is the imperishable being, [...] "say the Vedas. All philosophy, of east and west, has the same centripetence. Urged by an opposite necessity, the mind returns from the one, to that which is not one, but other or many; from cause to effect; and affirms the necessary existence of variety, the self-existence of both, as each is involved in the other. These strictly-blended elements it is the problem of thought to separate, and to reconcile. Their existence is mutually contradictory and exclusive; and each so fast <b>slides</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> other, that we can never say what is one, and what it is not. The Proteus is as nimble in the highest as in the lowest grounds, when we contemplate the one, the true, the good,--as in the surfaces and extremities of matter. In all nations, there are minds which incline to dwell in the conception of the fundamental Unity. The raptures of prayer and ecstasy of devotion lose all being in one Being. This tendency finds its highest expression in the religious writings of the East, and chiefly, in the Indian Scriptures, in the Vedas, the Bhagavat Geeta, and the Vishnu Purana. Those writings contain little else than this idea, and they rise to pure and sublime strains in celebrating it.|$|E
