5000|$|Rod {{motion is}} {{performed}} using rod drive control systems. Newer BWRs such as the ABWR and ESBWR {{as well as all}} German and Swedish BWRs use the Fine Motion Control Rod Drive system, which allows multiple rods to be controlled with very smooth motions. This allows a reactor operator to evenly increase the core's reactivity until the reactor is critical. Older BWR designs use a manual control system, which is usually limited to controlling one or four control rods at a time, and only through a series of notched positions with fixed intervals between these positions. Due to the limitations of the manual control system it is possible while <b>starting-up</b> that the core can be placed into a condition where a single control rod can cause a large uneven reactivity change which can potentially challenge the fuel's thermal design margins. As a result, GE developed a set of rules in 1977 called BPWS (Banked Position Withdrawal Sequence) which help minimize the worth of any single control rod and prevent fuel damage {{in the case of a}} control rod drop accident. BPWS separates control rods into four groups, A1, A2, B1, and B2. Then, either all of the A control rods or B control rods are pulled full out in a defined sequence to create a [...] "checkboard" [...] pattern. Next the opposing group (B or A) is pulled in a defined sequence to positions 02, then 04, 08, 16, and finally full out (48), until the reactor enters the power operation range where thermal limits are no longer bounding. By following a BPWS compliant start-up sequence, the manual control system can be used to evenly and safely raise the entire core to critical, and prevent any fuel rods from exceeding 280 cal/gm energy release during any postulated event which could potentially damage the fuel.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Design of a {{component}} usually involves optimizing its dimensions {{to meet the}} operational requirements without failure during the design life. If the operational loads are constant and the operating temperature is not high, {{a component}} can be designed for infinite life. However, if the operational loads are fluctuating, they cause fatigue in the component. In addition, if the component operates at high temperatures for very long periods, it may experience creep damage. With the increase of steam turbines steam parameter and the participation in peak-load adjustment of power grid more and more frequently, {{the stress of the}} turbine's rotor is becoming increasingly complex, and the variable thermal stress has became the major factor reducing its life.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine whether men and women {{starting}} a business use the informal economy and do so to test the viability of their venture. Design/methodology/approach – To do this, the results of a survey of 595 small business owners in the UK conducted in August 2012 are reported. Findings – Of the 22 per cent of men and 13 per cent of women small business owners reporting that they traded informally when starting their business, 66 per cent of the men and 53 per cent of the women assert that a main reason was to test the viability of their business. Hence, just over one in six small businesses started by men and one in 14 started by women (one in eight overall) traded in the informal economy when <b>starting-up</b> in order to test the viability of the business. Research limitations/implications – A more extensive survey of a wider range of countries is required to further evaluate the tentative findings of this single country small-scale survey. Practical implications – If tax administrations seek to stamp out informal sector entrepreneurship, one hand of government will be eradicating a significant minority of the entrepreneurship that other hands of government wish to foster. Men and women <b>starting-up</b> informally, however, require different policy approaches to help them formalise their business ventures.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a micro power light energy harvesting system for indoor environments. Light energy is collected by amorphous silicon photovoltaic (a-Si:H PV) cells, processed by a switched capacitor (SC) voltage doubler circuit with {{maximum power point}} tracking (MPPT), and finally stored in a large capacitor. The MPPT fractional open circuit voltage (V-OC) technique is implemented by an asynchronous state machine (ASM) that creates and dynamically adjusts the clock frequency of the step-up SC circuit, matching the input impedance of the SC circuit to the maximum power point condition of the PV cells. The ASM has a separate local power supply to make it robust against load variations. In order to reduce the area occupied by the SC circuit, while maintaining an acceptable efficiency value, the SC circuit uses MOSFET capacitors with a charge sharing scheme for the bottom plate parasitic capacitors. The circuit occupies an area of 0. 31 mm(2) in a 130 nm CMOS technology. The system was designed in order to work under realistic indoor light intensities. Experimental results show that the proposed system, using PV cells with an area of 14 cm(2), is capable of <b>starting-up</b> from a 0 V condition, with an irradiance of only 0. 32 W/m(2). After <b>starting-up,</b> the system requires an irradiance of only 0. 18 W/m(2) (18 mu W/cm(2)) to remain operating. The ASM circuit can operate correctly using a local power supply voltage of 453 mV, dissipating only 0. 085 mu W. These values are, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the lowest reported in the literature. The maximum efficiency of the SC converter is 70. 3 % for an input power of 48 mu W, which is comparable with reported values from circuits operating at similar power levels...|$|E
