50|$|Although {{the format}} of the forward and {{backward}} Corsi block test are analogous to the forward and backward forms of the digit <b>span</b> <b>task</b> (which tests verbal memory span rather than visuo-spatial memory span), the backward Corsi block tapping test differs from the backwards digit <b>span</b> <b>task</b> in its relative difficulty. For example, in a study done on the Corsi block tapping task and the digit <b>span</b> <b>task</b> both forward and backward, researchers found that although the backward version of the digit <b>span</b> <b>task</b> was significantly harder than the forward, {{there was no significant difference}} between the forward and backwards version of the Corsi block tapping task.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMost {{studies in}} {{individual}} differences {{in the field of}} working memory research use complex <b>span</b> <b>tasks</b> to measure working memory capacity. Various complex <b>span</b> <b>tasks</b> based on different materials have been developed, and these tasks have proven both reliable and valid; several complex <b>span</b> <b>tasks</b> are often combined to provide a domain-general estimate of working memory capacity with even better psychometric properties. The present work sought to address two issues. Firstly, having participants perform several full-length complex <b>span</b> <b>tasks</b> in succession makes for a long and tedious procedure. Secondly, few complex <b>span</b> <b>tasks</b> have been translated and validated in French. We constructed a French working memory task labeled the Composite Complex Span (CCS). The CCS includes shortened versions of three classic complex span tasks: the reading span, symmetry span, and operation span. We assessed the psychometric properties of the CCS, including test-retest reliability and convergent validity, with Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices and with an alpha span task; the CCS demonstrated satisfying qualities in a sample of 1, 093 participants. This work provides evidence that shorter versions of classic complex <b>span</b> <b>tasks</b> can yield valid working memory estimates. The materials and normative data for the CCS are also included...|$|R
40|$|Working memory (WM) <b>span</b> <b>tasks</b> {{involving}} a complex activity performed concurrently with item retention {{have proven to}} be good predictors of high-level cognitive performance. The present study demonstrates that replacing these complex self-paced activities with simpler but computer-paced processes, such as reading successive letters, yields more predictive WM span measures. This finding suggests that WM <b>span</b> <b>tasks</b> evaluate a fundamental capacity that underpins complex as well as elementary cognitive processes. Moreover, the higher predictive power of computer-paced WM <b>span</b> <b>tasks</b> suggests that strategic factors do not contribute to the relationship between WM spans and high-level cognition. The theoretical construct of working memory has played an increasingly important role in accounting for cognition, and especially for high-level cognition. Working memory (WM) usually refers to a cognitive system devoted to the simultaneous maintenance and treatment of information that is involved in the planning, coordination, and control of high-level cognitive processes (Baddeley & Hitch, 1974; Daneman & Carpenter, 1980). This central role in cognition led many authors to propose <b>span</b> <b>tasks</b> that aimed at assessing WM capacity in individuals. In contrast to traditional short-term memory <b>span</b> <b>tasks,</b> which require simple maintenance and recall of information such as digits, letters, or words, WM <b>span</b> <b>tasks</b> involve a processing component in addition to the maintenance of to-be-recalled items. For example, individuals are asked to read sentences while maintaining their final words (reading span; Daneman & Carpenter, 1980) or to solve arithmetic problems while maintaining words (operation span; Turner & Engle, 1989). These WM span measures proved to reliably predict, better than short-term memory spans, performance {{in a wide range of}} complex activities such as reading comprehensio...|$|R
40|$|Different {{versions}} of complex, simple, and running tests of immediate memory span were compared {{in their ability}} to predict fluid intelligence (gF). Conditions across memory tasks differed in terms of whether or not a secondary cognitive task was interleaved between to-be-remembered items (complex versus other <b>span</b> <b>tasks),</b> whether or not more items were presented than were ultimately to-be-remembered (running versus other <b>span</b> <b>tasks),</b> and whether presentation rate was relatively fast or slow (running and simple <b>span</b> <b>tasks).</b> Regressions indicated that up to 42. 6 % of variance in general fluid gF was explained by the memory span measures entered in different combinations. Across comparisons, shared relationships among <b>span</b> <b>tasks</b> accounted for a plurality of total variance in gF. Results indicate that in spite of procedural differences and resulting intra-individual variance in memory performance, the present memory tasks captured largely the same inter-individual variance in working memory capacity, insofar as this is important for higher-order cognition.

5000|$|Verbal {{working memory}} is {{involved}} in many everyday tasks, such as remembering a friend's telephone number while entering it into a phone and understanding long and difficult sentences. Verbal working memory is also thought {{to be one of}} the elements underlying intelligence (often referred to as 'IQ,' meaning [...] "intelligence quotient"); thus, the digit <b>span</b> <b>task</b> is a common component of many IQ tests, including the widely used Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS). Performance on the digit <b>span</b> <b>task</b> is also closely linked to language learning abilities; improving verbal memory capacities may therefore aid mastery of a new language.|$|E
5000|$|The reading <b>span</b> <b>task</b> was {{the first}} {{instance}} {{of the family of}} complex span tasks, which differ from the traditional simple span tasks by adding a processing demand to the requirement to remember a list of items. In complex span tasks encoding of the memory items (e.g., words) alternates with brief processing episodes (e.g., reading sentences). For example, the operation <b>span</b> <b>task</b> combines verification of brief mathematical equations such as [...] "2+6/2 = 5?" [...] with memory for a word or a letter that follows immediately after each equation. Complex-span tasks have also been shown to be closely related to many other aspects of complex cognitive performance besides language comprehension, among other things to measures of fluid intelligence.|$|E
40|$|How to best measure {{working memory}} {{capacity}} {{is an issue}} of ongoing debate. Besides established complex <b>span</b> <b>tasks,</b> which combine short-term memory demands with generally unrelated secondary tasks, there exists a set of paradigms characterized by continuous and simultaneous updating of several items in working memory, such as the n-back, memory updating, or alpha <b>span</b> <b>tasks.</b> With a latent variable analysis (N = 96) based on content-heterogeneous operationalizations of both task families, the authors found a latent correlation between a complex span factor and an updating factor that was not statistically different from unity (r =. 96). Moreover, both factors predicted fluid intelligence (reasoning) equally well. The authors conclude that updating tasks measure working memory equally well as complex <b>span</b> <b>tasks.</b> Processes involved in building, maintaining, and updating arbitrary bindings may constitute the common working memory ability underlying performance on reasoning, complex <b>span,</b> and updating <b>tasks...</b>|$|R

40|$|Research has {{suggested}} that short-term memory and working memory (as measured by simple and complex <b>span</b> <b>tasks,</b> respectively) are separate constructs that are differentially related to higher order cognitive abilities. This claim is critically evaluated by reviewing research that has compared simple and complex <b>span</b> <b>tasks</b> in both experimental and correlational studies. In addition, a meta-analysis and re-analyses of key data sets were conducted. The review and analyses suggest that simple and complex <b>span</b> <b>tasks</b> largely measure the same basic subcomponent processes (e. g., rehearsal, maintenance, updating, controlled search) but differ in {{the extent to which}} these processes operate in a particular task. These differences largely depend on the extent to which phonological processes are maximized and variability from long list lengths is present. Potential methodological, psychometric, and assessment implications are discussed and a theoretical account of the data is proposed...|$|R
5000|$|The reading <b>span</b> <b>task</b> was {{the first}} {{instance}} {{of the family of}} [...] "complex span" [...] tasks (as opposed to [...] "simple span" [...] tasks). It is a complex verbal test because it draws upon both storage and processing (i.e., reading) elements of working memory, while simple verbal tests (e.g., word span) require the storage element alone.|$|E
5000|$|The Corsi block tapping task {{originated}} in the early 1970s {{as a set of}} 9 identical wooden blocks positioned on a board. The subject was required to point at the blocks in the order they were presented, or [...] "tapped". It was based off the digit <b>span</b> <b>task,</b> but instead of the verbal form of the Digit Span, it required the use of visuo-spatial memory.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{backward}} digit <b>span</b> <b>task,</b> {{the procedure is}} largely the same, except that subjects being tested are asked to recall the digits in backward order (e.g., if presented with the following string of numbers [...] "1 5 9 2 3," [...] the subject {{would be asked to}} recall the digits in reverse order; in the case, the correct response would be [...] "3 2 9 5 1").|$|E
40|$|Other than {{standardized}} instruments, such as {{intelligence test}} batteries, working memory (WM) <b>span</b> <b>tasks,</b> {{such as the}} counting span, operation span, and reading <b>span</b> <b>tasks,</b> {{are among the most}} widely used measurement tools in cog-nitive psychology. These tasks have come to prominence not only for their methodological merit, but also because theoretical advances in the study of human behavior since the cognitive revolution have placed WM as a central con-struct in psychology. Methodologically, WM <b>span</b> <b>tasks</b> have proven to be both reliable and valid measures of WM capacity (WMC), which we will document below. How-ever, the larger factor in accounting for their increased use is simply that WM has become a widely useful, scientifi-cally fruitful construct. It {{plays an important role in}} con-temporary global models of cognition (e. g., J. R. Anderson & Lebiere, 1998; Cowan, 1995), and it is purportedly in-volved in a wide range of complex cognitive behaviors, such as comprehension, reasoning, and problem solving (Engle, 2002).

40|$|Experimental {{research}} into children’s working memory span {{has shown that}} retention duration contributes substantially to span performance, while processing efficiency need not be related to concurrent memory load (Towse, Hitch, & Hutton, 1998).

The present paper considers whether adults perform working memory <b>span</b> <b>tasks</b> in a qualitatively different way.

Increased activation during these tasks was found in the PFC and, in several studies, also in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). People performing better on the task showed larger increase of activation in these areas, and their activation was correlated more over time, suggesting that their neural activity in these two areas was better coordinated, possibly due to stronger connectivity.|$|E
50|$|Research in the 1970s {{has shown}} that memory span with digits and words is only weakly related to {{performance}} in complex cognitive tasks such as text comprehension, which are assumed to depend on short-term memory.

Daneman and Carpenter introduced an extended version of the memory <b>span</b> <b>task</b> which they called reading span.|$|E
50|$|Researchers {{have found}} {{evidence}} that the P2 is involved in memory processes. Differences in P200 peak amplitude suggest that anterior and posterior distributional differences are elicited during encoding of words for rote and elaborative memory tasks. While encoding the words across both memory tasks, participants who subsequently recalled less generated larger frontal amplitudes and smaller parietal/occipital amplitudes than those who recalled more. Also, {{researchers have found that}} the P200 (overlapping with the P300) was elicited in a digit <b>span</b> <b>task</b> when participants heard the reverse order of a digit series that they previously heard. This indicates that the P2 is sensitive to short-term working memory and recognition as well.|$|E

50|$|Articulating the {{differential}} function of brain regions involved in working memory {{is dependent on}} tasks able to distinguish these functions. Most brain imaging studies of working memory have used recognition tasks such as delayed recognition of one or several stimuli, or the n-back task, in which each new stimulus in a long series must {{be compared to the}} one presented n steps back in the series. The advantage of recognition tasks is that they require minimal movement (just pressing one of two keys), making fixation of the head in the scanner easier. Experimental research and research on individual differences in working memory, however, has used largely recall tasks (e.g., the reading <b>span</b> <b>task,</b> see below). It is not clear to what degree recognition and recall tasks reflect the same processes and the same capacity limitations.|$|E
50|$|Research {{has found}} that there are cross-linguistic {{differences}} on a short-term memory test known as the digit-span task. For example, Chinese speakers as compared to English speakers had a greater digit span. An explanation of this observation is that digits in English take longer to say and subvocally rehearse in the phonological loop, a component of Baddely's model of working memory. It {{has been suggested that}} because memory for short words is better than for long words, a phenomenon known as the word-length effect, that there are cross-linguistic differences on the digit <b>span</b> <b>task.</b> This difference has also been observed in Welsh-English bilinguals, who rated themselves as more proficient in Welsh but had a greater digit span in English because of the shorter digit names. However, research has suggested that familiarity and long-term memory may play an important role and that differences are not strictly the result of subvocal rehearsal rates.|$|E

40|$|Complex (working memory) <b>span</b> <b>tasks</b> have {{generally}} shown {{larger and more}} consistent correlations with higherorder cognition than have simple (or short-term memory) <b>span</b> <b>tasks.</b> The relation between verbal complex and simple verbal <b>span</b> <b>tasks</b> to Xuid abilities {{as a function of}} list-length was examined. The results suggest that the simple span-Xuid abilities correlation changes as a function of list-length, but that the complex span-Xuid abilities correlation remains constant across list-lengths from lists as short as two items. Furthermore, regression and factor analytic results suggested that the longest simple span list-lengths and all of the complex span list-lengths had both unique and shared variability in predicting Xuid abilities, but that estimates of primary memory did not uniquely predict Xuid abilities. It is suggested that complex spans, generally, predict higher-order cognition {{to a greater extent than}} do simple spans because complex spans require retrieval of items that have been displaced from primary memory due to the processing component of these tasks. Items in simple spans will also be displaced from primary memory but only after primary memory has become overloaded. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{addresses}} three questions regarding age {{differences in working}} memory: (1) whether performance on complex <b>span</b> <b>tasks</b> decreases {{as a function of}} age at a faster rate than performance on simple span tasks; (2) whether spatial working memory decreases at a faster rate than verbal working memory; and (3) whether the structure of working memory abilities is different for different age groups. Adults, ages 20 – 89 (n = 388), performed three simple and three complex verbal <b>span</b> <b>tasks</b> and three simple and three complex spatial memory tasks. Performance on the spatial tasks decreased at faster rates as a function of age than performance on the verbal tasks, but within each domain, performance on complex and simple <b>span</b> <b>tasks</b> decreased at the same rates. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed that domain-differentiated models yielded better fits than models involving domain-general constructs, providing further evidence of the need to distinguish verbal and spatial working memory abilities. Regardless of which domain-differentiated model was examined, and despite the faster rates of decrease in the spatial domain, age group comparisons revealed that the factor structure of working memory abilities was highly similar in younger and older adults and showed no evidence of age-related dedifferentiation...|$|R
40|$|Schmeichel (2007) {{reported}} that performing an initial task before completing a working memory <b>span</b> <b>task</b> can lower span scores {{and suggested that}} the effect was due to depleted cognitive resources.

Thirteen adult survivors of {{traumatic brain injury}} (TBI) and 10 healthy controls completed three working memory (WM) tasks: an auditory verbal n-back task, a listening <b>span</b> <b>task,</b> and a digit <b>span</b> <b>task.</b> The n-back task required that participants manually respond to previously specified types of matches located within strings of letters. In the listening <b>span</b> <b>task,</b> participants listened to sets of sentences during which they made true/false judgments, {{while at the same}} time maintaining the final word from each sentence in their working memory. The digit <b>span</b> <b>task</b> involved the recall of increasingly longer strings of numbers in either forward or backward order. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used when there were both between- and within-group comparisons, whereas simple group comparisons were made in the absence of within-group variables.

The correlational analysis showed that the complex verbal and spatial working memory <b>span</b> <b>tasks</b> were associated together and consistently predicted reasoning performance in both verbal and visual modalities. The confirmatory factor analysis showed that three factors best accounted for the data -a verbal, a spatial, and a general resource.
