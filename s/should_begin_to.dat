25|$|The {{playing of}} the wire-strung harp has been {{described}} as extremely difficult. Because of the long-lasting resonance, the performer had to dampen strings which had just been played while new strings were being plucked, and this while playing rapidly. Contrary to conventional modern practice, the left hand played the treble and the right the bass. It was said that a player <b>should</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> learn the harp no later than the age of seven. The best modern players have shown, however, that reasonable competence may be achieved even at a later age.|$|E
25|$|Isaac became {{blind in}} his old age and decided to bestow {{the blessing of the}} firstborn upon Esau. According to the Midrash, Isaac had reached the age of 132, five years past the age his mother, Sarah, had been at her death. According to Genesis, Isaac had reached the age of 137. At this time, the Sages state that one <b>should</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> think he might not exceed the age of {{whichever}} parent died first. Isaac therefore sent Esau out to the fields to trap and cook a piece of savory game for him, so that he could eat it and bless Esau before he died.|$|E

25|$|Berlioz was {{convinced}} by Princess Sayn-Wittgenstein– {{with whom he}} had corresponded for some time– that he <b>should</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> compose a new opera. This work would eventually become Les Troyens (The Trojans), a monumental grand opera with a libretto (which he wrote himself) based on Books Two and Four of Virgil's Aeneid. The idea of creating an opera based on the Aeneid had already been in his mind several years, by the time Sayn-Wittgenstein had approached him, and despite a long disillusionment, his creative flame seems to have remained lit. Les Troyens proved to be a very personal work for Berlioz, as it paid homage to his first literary love, whom he still cherished– even after his discoveries of Shakespeare and Goethe. The opera was planned around five acts, similar in size to the grand opera of Meyerbeer. It was composed with the Paris Opéra in mind, a most prestigious venue. Berlioz's chances of securing a production in which his work would receive attention equal to its merits were negligible from the start– a fact he must have been aware of. Despite these grim prospects, Berlioz saw the work through to its completion in 1858.|$|E
500|$|Brownlee clashed {{again with}} the UFA's radical {{elements}} {{on the question of}} a provincial bank. The writings of C. H. Douglas advocating an economic system that he called social credit were attracting notice in Alberta, and his adherents included many UFA members. [...] Led by George Bevington, they sponsored a resolution at the UFA convention in January 1923 calling {{for the creation of a}} government-owned bank. [...] After Bevington's introduction, support for the resolution was running high; Brownlee cooled enthusiasm with a speech of his own warning delegates that Alberta's debt load could not manage the programs that Bevington proposed that a provincial bank should undertake. [...] Even so, the convention passed a resolution calling on the provincial government to apply for a bank charter from the federal government, which was responsible for banking under the British North America Act, 1867. [...] At Brownlee's recommendation, the Greenfield government struck a commission under the leadership of University of Alberta economist D. A. MacGibbon, which strongly recommended against the establishment of a provincial bank. [...] This mirrored Brownlee's own conclusion, reached after investigating state-run banks in New Zealand and New South Wales. [...] At the 1924 UFA convention, Bevington and his followers reaffirmed their demands; Brownlee responded by pointing to the findings of the MacGibbon commission and to his contention that the proposal was unconstitutional and would bankrupt the province. [...] In this he was supported by Henry Wise Wood, whom Bevington was challenging for the UFA presidency. [...] Brownlee proposed instead that the government's treasury branches <b>should</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> accept deposits.|$|E

2500|$|The modern game, however, {{has largely}} {{discarded}} positional play {{in favour of}} a free flowing running game and attempting to have loose men in various positions on the ground. The rise in popularity of the hand-pass since the 1970s has greatly influenced this style of play, with players more willing to follow the ball and move it quickly amongst themselves rather than kicking long to a one-on-one marking contest. In the late 1990s a tactic known as flooding was devised and also shifted focus away from set positions. When a team [...] "plays a flood", they direct {{two or more of}} their midfield or forward line players into their defence, thus out-numbering their opponent and making it difficult for any opposing forward to take an uncontested mark. Most football sides are named (and demonstrated) in the traditional set positions, but it is in fact uncommon for players to stay within the traditional areas of their position. The players are shuffled {{on and off the field}} using the interchange bench, the blood rule means that if any player, for any reason, <b>should</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> bleed, no matter how minor or severe, they must remove themselves from the ground to receive treatment. They may return when the flow of blood has stopped and has been treated by the team medic.|$|E

2500|$|The {{idea that}} [...] "empty" [...] space {{can have an}} {{intrinsic}} energy associated to it, {{and that there is}} no such thing as a [...] "true vacuum" [...] is seemingly unintuitive. It is often argued that the entire universe is completely bathed in the zero-point radiation, and as such it can add only some constant amount to calculations. Physical measurements will therefore reveal only deviations from this value. For many practical calculations zero-point energy is dismissed by fiat in the mathematical model as a term that has no physical effect. Such treatment causes problems however, as in Einstein's theory of general relativity the absolute energy value of space is not an arbitrary constant and gives rise to the cosmological constant. For decades most physicists assumed that there was some undiscovered fundamental principle that will remove the infinite zero-point energy and make it completely vanish. If the vacuum has no intrinsic, absolute value of energy it will not gravitate. It was believed that as the universe expands from the aftermath of the big bang, the energy contained in any unit of empty space will decrease as the total energy spreads out to fill the volume of the universe; galaxies and all matter in the universe <b>should</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> decelerate. This possibility was ruled out in 1998 by the discovery that the expansion of the universe is not slowing down but is in fact accelerating, meaning empty space does indeed have some intrinsic energy. The discovery of dark energy is best explained by zero-point energy, though it still remains a mystery as to why the value appears to be so small compared to huge value obtained through theory - the cosmological constant problem.|$|E
