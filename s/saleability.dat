500|$|Joust 2 was {{developed}} by Williams Electronics, with John Newcomer as the lead designer. The game features amplified monaural sound and raster graphics on a 19-inch color CRT monitor. Like other Williams arcade games, Joust 2 was programmed in assembly language. Williams' video game department had shrunk following {{a decline in the}} video game industry. The company wanted to sell an arcade conversion kit for games that use a vertically oriented monitor, which had become popular at the time. Management felt that a sequel would improve the kit's <b>saleability.</b> The company decided to release a sequel to either [...] or Joust, ultimately choosing the latter. Technology had progressed since the original's release, providing more flexibility than before. As a result, Newcomer conceived new elements: additional characters, improved audio-visuals, and new mechanics. To portray a progression of villains, the staff added a new enemy, Knight Lord. The developers added backgrounds to the levels, inspired by artwork by M. C. Escher, Newcomer's favorite artist. Staff added a transform button to provide players with more variety and balance the gameplay.|$|E

2500|$|Coal plies and {{particles}} {{have different}} relative densities, determined by vitrinite content, rank, ash value/mineral content and porosity. Coal is usually washed by passing {{it over a}} bath of liquid of known density. This removes high-ash value particle and increases the <b>saleability</b> of the coal {{as well as its}} energy content per unit volume. Thus, coals must be subjected to a float-sink test in the laboratory, which will determine the optimum particle size for washing, the density of the wash liquid required to remove the maximum ash value with the minimum work.|$|E
2500|$|After several small, {{studio and}} {{independent}} released films that included stand-outs Sisters, Phantom of the Paradise, and Obsession, a small film {{based on a}} novel called Carrie was released directed by Brian De Palma. The psychic thriller Carrie is seen by some as De Palma's bid for a blockbuster. In fact, the project was small, underfunded by United Artists, and well under the cultural radar during {{the early months of}} production, as Stephen King's source novel had yet to climb the bestseller list. De Palma gravitated toward the project and changed crucial plot elements based upon his own predilections, not the <b>saleability</b> of the novel. The cast was young and relatively new, though Sissy Spacek and John Travolta had gained attention for previous work in, respectively, film and episodic sitcoms. Carrie became a hit, the first genuine box-office success for De Palma. It garnered Spacek and Piper Laurie Oscar nominations for their performances. Preproduction for the film had coincided with the casting process for George Lucas's Star Wars, and many of the actors cast in De Palma's film had been earmarked as contenders for Lucas's movie, and vice versa. The [...] "shock ending" [...] finale is effective even while it upholds horror-film convention, its suspense sequences are buttressed by teen comedy tropes, and its use of split-screen, split-diopter and slow motion shots tell the story visually rather than through dialogue.|$|E
2500|$|Concerning {{attitude}} toward audience, the two have, some argue, {{a lot in}} common. Magical realist works do not seek to primarily satisfy a popular audience, but instead, a sophisticated audience that must be attuned to noticing textual [...] "subtleties". While the postmodern writer condemns escapist literature (like fantasy, crime, ghost fiction), he/she is inextricably related to it concerning readership. There are two modes in postmodern literature: one, commercially successful pop fiction, and the other, philosophy, better suited to intellectuals. A singular reading of the first mode will render a distorted or reductive understanding of the text. The fictitious readersuch as Aureliano from 100 Years of Solitudeis the hostage used to express the writer's anxiety on this issue of who is reading the work and to what ends, and of how the writer is forever reliant upon the needs and desires of readers (the market). The magic realist writer with difficulty must reach a balance between <b>saleability</b> and intellectual integrity. Wendy Faris, talking about magic realism as a contemporary phenomenon that leaves modernism for postmodernism, says, [...] "Magic realist fictions do seem more youthful and popular than their modernist predecessors, in that they often (though not always) cater with unidirectional story lines to our basic desire to hear what happens next. Thus {{they may be more}} clearly designed for the entertainment of readers." ...|$|E

50|$|The distortive {{effects on}} engine design were seen {{to reduce the}} <b>saleability</b> of British {{vehicles}} in export markets. While the system had protected the home market from the import of large-engined low-priced (because produced in such high volumes) American vehicles the need for roomy generously proportioned cars for export was now paramount and the British government abandoned the tax horsepower system with effect from 1 January 1947 replacing it at first with a tax on cubic capacity, which was in turn replaced by a flat tax applying from 1 January 1948.|$|E

In his pursuit of works that spoke to him, he co-founded the Washington Abstraction Group with Arshile Gorky.|$|E

50|$|The <b>saleability</b> of {{the item}} {{and the amount}} that the {{customer}} wants for it are also factored into the pawnbroker's assessment; if a customer offers a very salable item at a low price, the pawnbroker may accept it {{even if it is}} unlikely that the customer will return, because the pawnshop can turn around a quick profit on the item. However, if a customer offers an extremely low price the pawnbroker may turn down the offer, because this suggests that the item may either be counterfeit or stolen.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Saleability</b> (also called profitability) is a {{technical}} analysis {{term used to}} compare performances of different trading systems or different investments within one system. Note, {{it is not simply}} another word for profit. There are varying definitions for it, some as simple as the expected or average ratio of revenue to cost for a particular investment or trading system or [...] "ratio of the number of winning trades or investments to the total number of trades or investments made, a number ranging from zero to 1." [...] Others can be complex or counter-intuitive.|$|E
50|$|In general, {{the cost}} of {{manufacturing}} a surface increases as the surface finish improves. Any given manufacturing process is usually optimized enough {{to ensure that the}} resulting texture is usable for the part's intended application. If necessary, an additional process will be added to modify the initial texture. The expense of this additional process must be justified by adding value in some way—principally better function or longer lifespan. Parts that have sliding contact with others may work better or last longer if the roughness is lower. Aesthetic improvement may add value if it improves the <b>saleability</b> of the product.|$|E
50|$|The size of paintings, {{and very}} often the prices they realized, {{increasingly}} tended to reflect {{their position in the}} hierarchy in this period. Until the Romantic period the price and <b>saleability</b> of what were essentially landscapes could be increased by adding small mythological or religious figures, creating a landscape with..., a practice that went back to the beginnings of landscape painting in the Flemish world landscapes of Joachim Patinir in the early 16th century. Flemish Baroque painting was the last school to often paint the lowest genres at a large size, but usually combined with figure subjects.|$|E
50|$|Commercial {{galleries}} often {{choose to}} represent artists exclusively, {{giving them the}} opportunity to have solo shows regularly. They usually promote the artist's shows by cultivating collectors, making press contacts, and trying to get critical reviews. Most reputable galleries absorb the cost of printing invitations to the opening, guidebooks, and other P.R. publications. Some galleries self-publish or help to arrange publishing for art books and monographs concerning their artists. They sometimes provide a stipend or otherwise ensure the artist has enough money to make ends meet. One idiosyncrasy of contemporary art galleries is their aversion to signing business contracts, although this is changing due to artists taking more control of their output and <b>saleability</b> through professional practice information provided by artists' associations.|$|E
5000|$|The overall {{achievement}} of Légaré contrasts {{with that of}} his prolific contemporaries Roy-Audy, Antoine Plamondon and Theophile Hamel. Légaré's relative financial freedom allowed him to paint as he pleased without {{having to worry about}} <b>saleability.</b> He sold several works to parish churches and religious orders but did not always find a ready market for his works. Many of his landscapes [...] "were all but rejected by his fellow countrymen, as other of his works were, because of his political opinions". Many of his supporters were [...] "as newspapers of the day often emphasized, foreigners". He was named to the Legislative Council of the Province of Canada in February 1855 and died in office in Quebec City at the age of 60.|$|E
5000|$|High-concept {{television}} series and movies often rely on pre-sold properties such as movie stars to build audience anticipation, {{and they might}} use cross-promotional advertising campaigns with links to a soundtrack, music videos, and licensed merchandise such as DVD box sets. They commonly apply market and test screening feedback to alter the narrative (or even, {{as in the case}} of Snakes on a Plane, the dialogue) to ensure maximum popularity. Some commercial blockbuster movies are built as star vehicles for successful music and sports personalities to enter the movie business. In such commercial vehicles, where the onscreen activity is less important than the <b>saleability</b> of the product brand, a high-concept narrative is often used as a [...] "safe" [...] option to avoid the risk of alienating audiences with convoluted or overly taxing plot exposition.|$|E
5000|$|In 2009 the Lembi Group was in {{financial}} distress {{due to a}} combination of softening rents due to the Late 2000s recession (which hurt the effectiveness of its strategy of replacing existing rent-control tenants by attrition and eviction), inability to renew or refinance existing loans due to the Financial crisis of 2007-2010, and a resulting decrease in value and <b>saleability</b> of commercial properties that made it impossible to re-sell buildings to avoid foreclosure. Given the high financial leverage and the group's having initially paid above-market prices, many of their loans were underwater. [...] As of that time the company was attempting to renegotiate approximately $1 billion in loans, and in possible default on another $164 million loan. [...] By the summer of 2009 the company had transferred 51 properties to one lender in lieu of foreclosure, and was in foreclosure proceedings on more than 60 others.|$|E
50|$|An {{acceptable}} {{quality level}} {{is a test}} and/or inspection standard that prescribes {{the range of the}} number of defective components that is considered acceptable when random sampling those components during an inspection. The defects found during an electronic or electrical test, or during a physical (mechanical) inspection, are sometimes classified into three levels: critical, major and minor. Critical defects are those that render the product unsafe or hazardous for the end user or that contravene mandatory regulations. Major defects can result in the product's failure, reducing its marketability, usability or <b>saleability.</b> Lastly, minor defects do not affect the product's marketability or usability, but represent workmanship defects that make the product fall short of defined quality standards. Different companies maintain different interpretations of each defect type. In order to avoid argument, buyers and sellers agree on an AQL standard, chosen according to the level of risk each party assumes, which they use as a reference during pre-shipment inspection.|$|E
