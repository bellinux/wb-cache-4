40|$|We {{present a}} dual-resolution {{model of a}} deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) {{molecule}} in a bathing solution, where we concurrently couple atomistic bundled water and ions with the coarse-grained MAR- TINI model of the solvent. We use our fine-grained salt solution model as a solvent in the inner shell surrounding the DNA molecule, whereas the solvent in the outer shell is modeled by the coarse-grained model. The <b>solvent</b> <b>entities</b> can exchange between the two domains and adapt their resolution accordingly. We critically asses the performance of our multiscale model in adaptive resolution simulations of an infinitely long DNA molecule, focusing on the structural characteristics of the solvent around DNA. Our analysis shows that the adaptive resolution scheme does not produce any noticeable artifacts in comparison to a refer- ence system simulated in full detail. The effect of using a bundled-SPC model, required for multiscaling, compared to the standard free SPC model is also evaluated. Our multiscale approach opens the way for large scale applications of DNA and other biomolecules which require a large solvent reservoir to avoid boundary effects...|$|R
40|$|The {{reaction}} {{between the}} racemic {{mixture of the}} camphor- 4 -phenylthiosemicarbazone derivative and cadmium acetate dihydrate yielded the title compound, [Cd(C 17 H 20 N 3 OS) 2]. The CdII ion is six-coordinated in a distorted octahedral environment by two deprotonated thiosemicarbazone ligands acting as an O,N,S-donor in a tridentate chelating mode, forming five-membered chelate rings. In the crystal, the molecules are connected via pairs of N—H [...] . S and C—H [...] . S interactions, building centrosymmetric dimers. One of the ligands is disordered in the campher unit over two sets of sites with site-occupancy factors of 0. 7 and 0. 3. The structure contains additional solvent molecules, which are disordered and for which no reasonable split model was found. Therefore, the data were corrected for disordered solvent using the SQUEEZE routine [Spek (2015). Acta Cryst. C 71, 9 – 18] in PLATON. Since the disordered solvents were removed by data processing, {{and the number of}} <b>solvent</b> <b>entities</b> was a suggestion only, they were not considered in the chemical formula and subsequent chemical or crystal information...|$|R

Counsel for Garlock, Garland Cassada of the Charlotte NC law firm Robinson, Bradshaw & Hinson, was successful in persuading Judge George Hodges to permit full discovery of 15 high-value asbestos claims settled by Garlock when it was a <b>solvent</b> <b>entity.</b> Using data obtained from these cases by Cassada, Professor Brickman’s expert report set forth evidence of fraud, misrepresentation and “double-dipping” (contradictory accounts of exposure between tort and bankruptcy-trust claims) in all 15 cases, the net effect of which was to inflate the value of future claims that may be made against the bankrupt entity. [...] The claimants, represented by the Garlock Asbestos Claims Committee, had estimated that future liability as high as $1.3 billion. Judge Hodges, in his January 10, 2014 “Order Estimating Aggregate Liability,” reduced the amount required for the bankruptcy trust by more than $1 billion, to $125 million, asserting that: ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the legal environment of netting agreements covering financial contracts. It concludes that an international instrument {{should be developed}} capable of improving the effectiveness of netting agreements in mitigating systemic risk. To this end, two {{different aspects of the}} enforceability of netting agreements are considered: (i) the general enforceability of netting, and (ii) the possibility of precluding the operation of netting a mechanism by way of a regulatory moratorium for considerations of systemic stability. The first part of the study presents the use of netting and the various forms it may take before going on to explain the benefits and drawbacks of enforceable netting agreements. Benefits for individual firms consist in lower counterparty risk and more favourable capital requirements. Benefits for the financial market as a whole flow from greater financial market stability since the contagion of systemically relevant institutions by the default or insolvency of another institution is limited, thus helping to avoid systemic effects. Additionally, the use of netting arrangements can improve overall market liquidity. A potential drawback of enforceability of netting, in certain situations, is that the operation of a netting mechanism could actually work against the purpose of systemic stability where the transfer of parts of the business of an insolvent financial institution to a <b>solvent</b> bridge <b>entity</b> would enhance or maintain value {{to a greater extent than}} the operation of a netting agreement would. Regulatory authorities are considering under which conditions a moratorium to halt the netting mechanism until the situation is solved could avoid this threat to systemic stability. The second part of the {{study examines}} whether there is the potential to support the purpose of enhanced systemic stability by way of international harmonisation of private and insolvency law. As regards the issue of general enforceability, the global picture of netting legislation is heterogeneous. Given the great practical relevance of the matter, an international instrument could be very useful. As to the issue of private law consequences of regulatory moratoria, the absence of a harmonised framework appears to lead to actual cross-border inconsistency and legal uncertainty as regards financial contracts that are governed by a foreign law. Taking these to aspects into account, this paper recommends that work on developing an international instrument be undertaken. The final part of the study suggests a set of preliminary guidelines for the development of suchan instrument. In the light of the findings of the previous sections, a mixed, two-step approach is recommended. First, a non-binding instrument could be developed, serving as a benchmark and reservoir of legal solutions in respect of the relevant issues. Secondly, isolated aspects relating to both the general enforceability of netting and the accommodation of a regulatory moratorium in foreign private and insolvency law could be dealt with in an international Convention, in particular where cross-border situations involving netting require uniformity of applicable legal rules...|$|R
