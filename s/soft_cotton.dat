It is an {{enduring}} form of a stuffed animal {{that has become a}} collector's item. The first teddy bear was invented in 1902 by Morris Michtom, owner of a Brooklyn toy store, who was inspired by Clifford Berryman's political cartoon Drawing the Line in Mississippi that depicted President Theodore [...] "Teddy" [...] Roosevelt on a hunting trip in Mississippi who spared the life of a Louisiana black bear cub. Michtom asked for and received President Roosevelt's permission to use his name for the hand-sewn bears called [...] "Teddy bears" [...] that he invented and his wife helped construct.|$|E

On each of these days, she performs this examination in the morning and in the later afternoon before sunset. If no blood is found, she may go to the mikveh on the eighth evening after nightfall, and then engage in intercourse with her husband.

60|$|The {{old woman}} at once entered. Roger made signs, by rubbing his hands together, and passing them {{over his face}} and head, that he wanted water. This the old woman brought, in a basin formed of the half of an immense gourd, and a <b>soft</b> <b>cotton</b> cloth with which to dry himself. Then she brought in a small pot, filled with {{something}} which looked to him like fat, but which he afterwards found was extracted from a vegetable, and put it down {{by the side of}} the water.|$|E

Two attendants brought round waiters, upon {{one of which was}} placed a pile of a substance which looked to Roger {{as if it were the}} leaves of some vegetable, broken into small pieces, and also a gold box containing a brown dust. On the other tray were placed a variety of instruments, of whose use Roger was ignorant. They were small tubes, inserted into bowls of gold or silver; and in addition to these were some things that looked like yellowish-brown sticks, of two or three inches in length, with tubes into which they fitted.|$|E
60|$|There {{was nothing}} that Sam liked better than for the big drum to commence, and with his head thrown well back and an air of extreme importance, he lifted his arm and brought it down with {{what should have been}} a {{sounding}} blow upon the drum. To his astonishment and to the surprise of all the band, no deep boom was heard, only a low muffled sound. Mechanically Sam raised his other arm and let it fall with a similar result. Sam looked a picture of utter astonishment and dismay, with his eyes opened to their fullest, and he gave vent to a loud cry, which completed the effect produced by his face, and set most of those looking on, and even the band themselves, into a roar of laughter. Sam now examined his sticks, they appeared all right to the eye, but directly he felt them his astonishment was turned into rage. They were perfectly soft. Taking out his knife he cut them open, and found that the balls were merely filled with a wad of <b>soft</b> <b>cotton,</b> the necessary weight being given by pieces of lead fastened round the end of the stick inside the ball with waxed thread.|$|E
6000|$|We {{got to the}} {{bulkhead}} at last. Those were stout planks. She was a ship, well finished in every detail--the Narcissus was. They were the stoutest planks ever put into a ship's bulkhead--we thought--and then we perceived that, in our hurry, we had sent all the tools overboard. Absurd little Belfast wanted to break it down with his own weight, and with both feet leaped straight up like a springbok, cursing the Clyde shipwrights for not scamping their work. Incidentally he reviled all North Britain, {{the rest of the}} earth, the sea--and all his companions. He swore, as he alighted heavily on his heels, that he would never, never any more associate with any fool that [...] "hadn't savee enough to know his knee from his elbow." [...] He managed by his thumping to scare the last remnant of wits out of Jimmy. We could hear the object of our exasperated solicitude darting to and fro under the planks. He had cracked his voice at last, and could only squeak miserably. His back or else his head rubbed the planks, now here, now there, in a puzzling manner. He squeaked as he dodged the invisible blows. It was more heartrending even than his yells. Suddenly Archie produced a crowbar. He had kept it back; also a small hatchet. We howled with satisfaction. He struck a mighty blow and small chips flew at our eyes. The boatswain above shouted:--"Look out! Look out there. Don't kill the man. Easy does it!" [...] Wamibo, maddened with excitement, hung head down and insanely urged us:--"Hoo! Strook'im! Hoo! Hoo!" [...] We were afraid he would fall in and kill one of us and, hurriedly, we entreated the boatswain to [...] "shove the blamed Finn overboard." [...] Then, all together, we yelled down at the planks:--"Stand from under! Get forward," [...] and listened. We only heard the deep hum and moan of the wind above us, the mingled roar and hiss of the seas. The ship, as if overcome with despair, wallowed lifelessly, and our heads swam with that unnatural motion. Belfast clamoured:--"For the love of God, Jimmy, where are ye?... Knock! Jimmy darlint!... Knock! You bloody black beast! Knock!" [...] He was as quiet as a dead man inside a grave; and, like men standing above a grave, we {{were on the verge of}} tears--but with vexation, the strain, the fatigue; with the great longing to be done with it, to get away, and lie down to rest somewhere where we could see our danger and breathe. Archie shouted:--"Gi'e me room!" [...] We crouched behind him, guarding our heads, and he struck time after time in the joint of planks. They cracked. Suddenly the crowbar went halfway in through a splintered oblong hole. It must have missed Jimmy's head by less than an inch. Archie withdrew it quickly, and that infamous nigger rushed at the hole, put his lips to it, and whispered [...] "Help" [...] in an almost extinct voice; he pressed his head to it, trying madly to get out through that opening one inch wide and three inches long. In our disturbed state we were absolutely paralysed by his incredible action. It seemed impossible to drive him away. Even Archie at last lost his composure. [...] "If ye don't clear oot I'll drive the crowbar thro' your head," [...] he shouted in a determined voice. He meant what he said, and his earnestness seemed to make an impression on Jimmy. He disappeared suddenly, and we set to prising and tearing at the planks with the eagerness of men trying to get at a mortal enemy, and spurred by the desire to tear him limb from limb. The wood split, cracked, gave way. Belfast plunged in head and shoulders and groped viciously. [...] "I've got 'im! Got 'im," [...] he shouted. [...] "Oh! There!... He's gone; I've got 'im!... Pull at my legs!... Pull!" [...] Wamibo hooted unceasingly. The boatswain shouted directions:--"Catch hold of his hair, Belfast; pull straight up, you two!... Pull fair!" [...] We pulled fair. We pulled Belfast out with a jerk, and dropped him with disgust. In a sitting posture, purple-faced, he sobbed despairingly:--"How can I hold on to 'is blooming short wool?" [...] Suddenly Jimmy's head and shoulders appeared. He stuck halfway, and with rolling eyes foamed at our feet. We flew at him with brutal impatience, we tore the shirt off his back, we tugged at his ears, we panted over him; and all at once he came away in our hands as though somebody had let go his legs. With the same movement, without a pause, we swung him up. His breath whistled, he kicked our upturned faces, he grasped two pairs of arms above his head, and he squirmed up with such precipitation that he seemed positively to escape from our hands like a bladder full of gas. Streaming with perspiration, we swarmed up the rope, and, coming into the blast of cold wind, gasped like men plunged into icy water. With burning faces we shivered to the very marrow of our bones. Never before had the gale seemed to us more furious, the sea more mad, the sunshine more merciless and mocking, and the position of the ship more hopeless and appalling. Every movement of her was ominous of the end of her agony and of the beginning of ours. We staggered away from the door, and, alarmed by a sudden roll, fell down in a bunch. It appeared to us that the side of the house was more smooth than glass and more slippery than ice. There was nothing to hang on to but a long brass hook used sometimes to keep back an open door. Wamibo held on to it and we held on to Wamibo, clutching our Jimmy. He had completely collapsed now. He did not seem to have the strength to close his hand. We stuck to him blindly in our fear. We were not afraid of Wamibo letting go (we remembered that the brute was stronger than any three men in the ship), but we were afraid of the hook giving way, and we also believed that the ship had made up her mind to turn over at last. But she didn't. A sea swept over us. The boatswain spluttered:--"Up and away. There's a lull. Away aft with you, or we will all go to the devil here." [...] We stood up surrounding Jimmy. We begged him to hold up, to hold on, at least. He glared with his bulging eyes, mute as a fish, and with all the stiffening knocked out of him. He wouldn't stand; he wouldn't even as much as clutch at our necks; he was only a cold black skin loosely stuffed with <b>soft</b> <b>cotton</b> wool; his arms and legs swung jointless and pliable; his head rolled about; the lower lip hung down, enormous and heavy. We pressed round him, bothered and dismayed; sheltering him we swung here and there in a body; and on the very brink of eternity we tottered all together with concealing and absurd gestures, like a lot of drunken men embarrassed with a stolen corpse.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the results of}} study conducted on floating granular piles constructed in <b>soft</b> black <b>cotton</b> soil. The soil beds were prepared in a model tank of diameter 173 mm and height 605 mm. The granular pile of diameter 55 mm was constructed at the centre of soil bed using crushed stone chips as the pile material. The load test {{was conducted on the}} granular pile. The length to diameter ratio (L/d ratio) of the pile was varied, from 1 to 11 with an interval of two, and the effect of pile length on load carrying capacity was studied. Further, to observe the effect of encasement of pile material, it was wrapped by geogrid and the load test was conducted. The test results show that the ultimate load carrying capacity, Qult of the granular pile increases as L/d ratio increases in both the cases i. e. without and with geogrid encasement. The increasing trend of Qult with L/d is observed continuing for the maximum L/d ratio i. e. 11, for the granular pile tested in the study. No well-defined critical length of granular pile is observed in the present investigation of floating granular piles in <b>soft</b> black <b>cotton</b> soil.

Like most peasant patterns, it is much more {{complicated}} and subtle than appears: the curious placing of the stripes, the subtle proportion, and a white thread left down one side only of each broad blue block. The stripes, moreover, run across the cloth, not lengthwise with it. But the width would be just long enough for a skirt--though the peasant skirts have almost all a band at the bottom with the stripes running round-ways.|$|R
