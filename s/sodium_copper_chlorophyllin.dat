In this study we evaluated various commercial lots of <b>sodium</b> <b>copper</b> <b>chlorophyllin</b> complex to identify the primary small molecule constituents, and to test various <b>sodium</b> <b>copper</b> <b>chlorophyllin</b> complexes and their small molecule analog compounds for hyaluronidase inhibitory activity in vitro. Ascorbate analogs were tested in combination with copper chlorophyllin complexes for potential additive or synergistic activity. Materials and methods: For hyaluronidase activity assays, dilutions of test materials were evaluated for hydrolytic activity of hyaluronidase by precipitation of non-digested hyaluronate by measuring related turbidity at 595 nm. High-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy was used to analyze and identify the primary small molecule constituents in various old and new commercial lots of <b>sodium</b> <b>copper</b> <b>chlorophyllin</b> complex. Results: The most active small molecule component of <b>sodium</b> <b>copper</b> <b>chlorophyllin</b> complex was disodium copper isochlorin e 4, followed by oxidized disodium copper isochlorin e 4. <b>Sodium</b> <b>copper</b> <b>chlorophyllin</b> complex and copper isochlorin e 4 disodium salt had hyaluronidase inhibitory activity down to 10 µg/mL. The oxidized form of copper isochlorin e 4 disodium salt had substantial hyaluronidase inhibitory activity at 100 µg/mL but not at 10 µg/mL. Ascorbate derivatives did not enhance the hyaluronidase inhibitory activity of <b>sodium</b> <b>copper</b> <b>chlorophyllin.</b> Copper isochlorin e 4 analogs were always the dominant components of the small molecule content of the commercial lots tested; oxidized copper isochlorin e 4 was found in increased concentrations in older compared to newer lots tested.

Patients and methods: Following a previously published 12 -day clinical assessment model, skin biopsy samples from the forearms of four healthy females with signs of photoaged skin were obtained and samples were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for key biomarkers of aging skin after each subject was treated with a test material consisting of a gel containing a liposomal dispersion of <b>sodium</b> <b>copper</b> <b>chlorophyllin</b> complex 0. 05 %, a positive control of tretinoin cream 0. 025 %, and an untreated negative control. Results: There was a statistically significantly greater amount of fibrillin/amyloid P and epidermal mucins found for skin treated with the test material containing 0. 05 % <b>sodium</b> <b>copper</b> <b>chlorophyllin</b> complex and the reference control tretinoin 0. 025 % cream compared to the negative control (untreated site). Expression of procollagen 1 and dermal mucin also showed a greater presence in the samples treated with the test material and the reference control compared to the negative control, though the differences were not statistically significant. No adverse events were observed or reported by the subjects {{during the course of the}} study. Conclusion: The results of this human biopsy study suggest that both retinoids and <b>sodium</b> <b>copper</b> <b>chlorophyllin</b> complex have beneficial effects on biomarkers of photoaged skin.

40|$|Chlorophyll {{is widely}} {{extracted}} for industrial applications {{and is a}} key topic of scientific and commercial interest. Alternanthera sessilis, which is known as mukunuwenna in Sri Lanka, is one of best selections for the extraction of chlorophyll due to the good extraction efficiency, availability and low cost. In this work, the optimum operating conditions for the extraction of chlorophyll from A. sessilis using solvent extraction were studied using buffered 80 % aqueous acetone. The results revealed that the best solvent volume to A. sessilis weight ratio, which gives the highest yield of chlorophyll, was 5 ml/g. The effect of temperature and the extraction time on the extraction was also studied. The optimum temperature of extraction is 50 °C and the optimum time of extraction is 45 minutes. The mass transfer of chlorophyll from A. sessilis at 20 °C and 30 °C was modeled mathematically, using general mass transfer equations. The experimental {{results showed that the}} degradation of chlorophyll beyond the temperature of 30 °C is significant. The saturation solubility of chlorophyll a was 54. 06 and 107. 6 μg/ml and that for chlorophyll b was 23. 13 and 29. 68 μg/ml at the temperatures of 20 and 30 °C respectively. Furthermore, the optimum pre-processing method and the storage conditions were studied as post harvest operations for A. sessilis. The optimum method of pre processing was identified as mechanical grinding. For one day storage, ambient air conditions (indoor) were the optimum conditions; and for a longer storage time it was the refrigerator conditions (15 oC).

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{has been}} growing {{interest}} in <b>sodium</b> <b>copper</b> <b>chlorophyllin</b> (Cu-Chl) as a food colourant and supplement owing to its beneficial biological activities. Studies have revealed that this green pigment inhibits experimental carcinogenesis and interacts with proteins and genotoxic agents. Health-related activities have also {{been associated with the}} prevention of lipid peroxidation. However, intestinal absorption of this pigment has been considered insignificant, raising questions of whether eventual biological properties are related to pre- or post-absorptive actions. In this study, intestinal absorption of Cu-Chl and its appearance in serum and organs were estimated by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis in rat feeding experiments. The effect of ingested Cu-Chl on lipid peroxidation was analysed by measuring thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and antioxidant enzyme activities in hepatic and brain tissues of oxidative stress-induced rats. RESULTS: The two main components of commercial Cu-Chl, namely Cu-chlorin e(6) and Cu-chlorin e(4), showed different digestive behaviours, and only Cu-chlorin e 4 was found in serum, liver and kidneys. Antioxidant activity in vivo could be observed in brain and seemed to be related to in situ protection but not to antioxidant enzyme modulation. CONCLUSION: As {{at least one of the}} major components of Cu-Chl is effectively absorbed, further pharmacolkinetic studies are encouraged to access absorption rates and the role of ingested copper chlorophyllins in mammals.

Moreover, their antioxidant activities were evaluated and {{compared with that}} of ascorbic acid through four biochemical assays: DPPH (2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging activity, reducing power, inhibition of β-carotene bleaching and O 2 – scavenging activity. SZC had better antioxidant properties at a lower dosage than SIC and SCC in all assays. In the β-carotene bleaching assay, EC 50 of SZC, SIC and SCC was 0. 04, 0. 38 and 0. 90 mg/mL, respectively, much lower than that of ascorbic acid (4. 0 mg/mL). SZC showed a better result (p< 0. 05) than ascorbic acid in the O 2 – scavenging activity assay. The results obtained from reducing power determination were also excellent: the absorbance values were all about 1. 0 at 0. 5 mg/mL, about half of that of ascorbic acid. In the investigation of DPPH radical scavenging activity, all chlorophyllins had lower activities than ascorbic acid.

The cytotoxicity of fecal water was determined with an erythrocyte bioassay and colonic epithelial cell proliferation was quantified in vivo by [methyl- 3 H]thymidine incorporation into newly synthesized DNA. Exfoliation of colonocytes was measured as the amount of rat DNA in feces using quantitative PCR analysis. Heme caused a > 50 -fold increase in the cytotoxicity of the fecal water, a nearly 100 % increase in proliferation, and almost total inhibition of exfoliation of the colonocytes. Furthermore, the addition of heme increased TBARS in fecal water. Chlorophyll, but not the chlorophyllins, completely prevented these heme-induced effects.
