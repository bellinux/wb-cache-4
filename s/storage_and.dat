5|$|Floating <b>storage</b> <b>and</b> {{offloading}} units (FSO) {{are used}} worldwide by the offshore oil industry to receive oil from nearby platforms and store {{it until it}} can be offloaded onto oil tankers. A similar system, the floating production <b>storage</b> <b>and</b> offloading unit (FPSO), {{has the ability to}} process the product while it is on board. These floating units reduce oil production costs and offer mobility, large storage capacity, and production versatility.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{conventional}} discrete time mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for scheduling multiproduct/multipurpose batch processes by introducing <b>storage</b> capacity <b>and</b> <b>storage</b> time limitations. For this purpose, storage vessels are explicitly modeled on which material flows are defined, <b>and</b> <b>storage</b> capacity <b>and</b> <b>storage</b> time constraints are expressed. The approach {{is shown to}} be effective in modeling the scheduling problem in a variety of storage configurations such as single/multiple dedicated <b>and</b> multipurpose <b>storage</b> vessels. In a numerical study, cases where <b>storage</b> capacity <b>and</b> <b>storage</b> time limitations have significant impacts on scheduling production <b>and</b> <b>storage</b> operations are highlighted.
