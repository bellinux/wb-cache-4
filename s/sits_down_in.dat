5|$|Steve, the host, {{presents}} {{the audience with}} a puzzle involving Blue, the animated dog... To help the audience unlock the puzzle, Blue leaves behind a series of clues, which are objects marked {{with one of her}} paw prints. In between the discovery of the clues, Steve plays a series of games — mini-puzzles — with the audience that are thematically related to the overall puzzle... As the show unfolds, Steve and Blue move from one animated set to another, jumping through magical doorways, leading viewers on a journey of discovery, until, {{at the end of the}} story, Steve returns to the living room. There, at the climax of the show, he <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> a comfortable chair to think — a chair known, of course, in the literal world of Blue's Clues, as the Thinking Chair. He puzzles over Blue's three clues and attempts to come up with the answer.|$|E
25|$|Alalia and Fratt, {{with the}} {{guidance}} of Ayn, finally reach their destination and prepare for the live broadcast. They contact Pjölk, who happily commands them to begin the transmission, then he turns off his tele-o-visor and <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> front of his typewriter to create the headline article for tomorrow's issue of his tabloid. He fabricates an entire story based on how he is distressed for being responsible for killing the nerd viewers, and where he makes {{a statement saying that}} there should be a law banning tele-o-vision forever. Not yet aware of the danger they are putting themselves in, Alalia and Fratt start broadcasting and begin their quest through the lair, following Ayn of Raiká.|$|E
500|$|The Doctor, Rose, and Adam {{arrive on}} Floor 139 of Satellite 5, {{a space station}} {{orbiting}} Earth in the year 200,000. [...] The Doctor uses his sonic screwdriver to get Adam and Rose some credits to buy food while he looks around the station. The Doctor meets a woman named Cathica, a reporter who tells him that the station is a giant broadcast tower transmitting news across Earth. They are led to a room where she <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> a chair located {{in the center of}} a round table. The reporters are connected to the computer via a special port installed directly into the brain. The Doctor believes there is a malevolent purpose to the station that is holding back human development. [...] He learns from Cathica that a select few are invited to Floor 500, which is believed to be the highest promotion that can be earned on the station.|$|E

2500|$|All but the {{smallest}} brothels operate as follows: as {{the customer is}} buzzed in and <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the parlor, the available women appear in a line-up and introduce themselves. If the customer chooses a woman, the price negotiations {{take place in the}} woman's room, which are often overheard by management. Typical prices start in the hundreds.

2500|$|Increasingly impatient, Juror 7 {{changes his}} vote to hasten the deliberation, which earns him {{the ire of}} Jurors 3 and 11, both on {{opposite}} sides of the debate. Juror 11, an immigrant from Europe, presses Juror 7 about using his vote frivolously, until Juror 7 admits that he truly believes the boy is not guilty. Then, Jurors 12 and 1 change their votes, leaving only three dissenters: Jurors 3, 4, and 10. Juror 10 vents a torrent of condemnation of slum-born people, claiming they are no better than animals who kill for fun. All jurors literally turn their backs on him, except for Juror 4, who tells him to [...] "Sit down and don't open your mouth again." [...] Juror 10 then humiliatingly <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> a corner by himself.|$|E
2500|$|Stunt {{performer}} Dick Warlock played Michael Myers (as in Halloween, {{listed as}} [...] "The Shape" [...] in the credits), replacing Castle who was beginning {{a career as}} a director. Warlock's previous experience in film was as a stunt double in films, such as The Green Berets (1968) and Jaws (1975), and the 1974 television series [...] In an interview, Warlock explained how he prepared for the role since Myers received far more screen time in the sequel than the original. Warlock said, where Laurie is huddled in the closet. Michael breaks through. She grabs a hanger and thrusts it up and into his eyes. Michael falls down and Laurie walks to the bedroom doorway and <b>sits</b> <b>down.</b> <b>In</b> the background, we see Michael sit up and turn towards her to the beat of the music. ... Anyway, that and the head tilt were the things I carried with me into Halloween II. I didn't really see that much more to hang my hat on in the first film. Warlock also claims that the mask he wore was the same one Nick Castle used in the first film. Hill confirmed this in an interview.|$|E
