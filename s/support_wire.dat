50|$|Housings for bicycle brakes {{need not}} be quite so compressionless, but need to be stronger, and items {{currently}} sold for this purpose use a close-wound spiral <b>support</b> <b>wire.</b> One end of a brake housing is tight-terminated in an end cap or ferrule that makes a loose fit within a barrel adjuster, {{and the other in}} any of a variety of fittings that includes end caps, or parts to effect a smooth change of direction.

In view of the wide array of cable constructions on offer, confusion as to the best housing can easily result. In general, a housing sold for one purpose should not be used for any other, and in any case the advice of the manufacturer should be followed. In particular, longitudinally reinforced housings should not be used for bicycle brakes, since they are weaker than the spirally wound housings.|$|E

5000|$|Due to {{the nature}} of live television, Live PD has {{captured}} incidents that may not have been aired on a traditional law enforcement program. One such event that received coverage was Bridgeport Police Sergeant Chris Robinson breaking down on camera after learning 13-month-old Michael Citron had died following Robinson escorting an ambulance carrying the child to a local hospital. As of February 2017, an investigation into the death is ongoing.A second event, involving a Tulsa, Oklahoma man named Randy Wallace, featured Wallace accusing Sgt. Sean [...] "Sticks" [...] Larkin of [...] "profiling" [...] and [...] "stalking." [...] Larkin had approached Wallace, inquiring what Wallace had in his open trunk while noting that Wallace's attire was consistent with gang colors worn in the neighborhood. On Live PD, Wallace was seen giving an impassioned denunciation of Larkin and the Tulsa Police as Larkin remained seated in his patrol vehicle. Speaking at a press conference, Wallace alleged, [...] "he slandered me as far as being a gang member and affiliate, he slandered me really bad." [...] In another incident, a family claimed to have recognized their loved one, 37-year-old Benjamin Johnson, deceased on television after what the Richland County Sheriff's Department said was a drug deal gone wrong. Two men were arrested in the case. Another incident that left the viewers shocked was on the July 8th episode where Senior Deputy Chris Mastrianni was called to a fight in progress at a large house party when a car, (leaving the same party), went right past him going about 90 mph (according to the officer). S/D Mastrianni initiated a Traffic Stop on the vehicle, which then proceeded to evade him for several minutes.The car then turned a corner before jumping a curb, hitting a power pole's <b>support</b> <b>wire</b> and rolling over. The driver then crawled out the window of his vehicle with his 2 year-old daughter in his arms, and began fighting with the S/D Mastrianni. The crazed man then released his child whom was taken to safety by the Live PD field producer. After several minutes, M/D Mark Laureano and S/D Katelyn Jasak arrived on scene and aided S/D Mastrianni in handcuffing and arresting the already mostly subdued man, as well as pushing back the rapidly growing cloud of bystanders whom were watching the events unfold, but failed to help the struggling police officer.The toddler received minor injuries in the form a broken arm, {{as a result of her}} father's negligent actions.|$|E
40|$|A {{robot arm}} should avoid {{collisions}} with the plant stem when it approaches a candidate sweet-pepper for harvesting. This study therefore aims at stem localization, a topic {{so far only}} studied under controlled lighting conditions. Objectives were to develop an algorithm capable of stem localization, using detection of the <b>support</b> <b>wire</b> that is twisted around the stem; to quantitatively evaluate performance of wire detection and stem localization under varying lighting conditions; to determine depth accuracy of stereo-vision under lab and greenhouse conditions. A single colour camera was mounted on a pneumatic slide to record image pairs with a small baseline of 1 cm. Artificial lighting was developed to mitigate disturbances caused by natural lighting conditions. An algorithm consisting of five steps was developed and includes novel components such as adaptive thresholding, use of support wires as a visual cue, use of object-based and 3 D features and use of minimum expected stem distance. Wire detection rates (true-positive/scaled false-positive) were more favourable under moderate irradiance (94 / 5 %) than under strong irradiance (74 / 26 %). Error of stem localization was measured, in the horizontal plane, by Euclidean distance. Error was smaller for interpolated segments (0. 8 cm), where a <b>support</b> <b>wire</b> was detected, than for extrapolated segments (1. 5 cm), where a <b>support</b> <b>wire</b> was not detected. Error increased under strong irradiance. Accuracy of the stereo-vision system (± 0. 4 cm) met the requirements (± 1 cm) in the lab, {{but not in the}} greenhouse (± 4. 5 cm) due to plant movement during recording. The algorithm is probably capable to construct a useful collision map for robotic harvesting, if the issue of inaccurate stereo-vision can be resolved by directions proposed for future work. This is the first study regarding stem localization under varying lighting conditions, and can be useful for future applications in crops that grow along a <b>support</b> <b>wire...</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. A novel {{approach}} was devised to estimate vegetative growth and fruit mass (i. e., yield) in grapevines by continuously measuring {{the tension in}} the horizontal (cordon) <b>support</b> <b>wire</b> of the trellis. Load cells installed in−line with the cordon wire were connected to an automated data acquisition system, a major departure from the viticulture industry’s standard method of collect-ing fruit samples by hand two or three times per growing season. Each experimental row in the vineyard was calibrated to deter-mine the change in tension in that row in response to an increase in known mass on the cordon wire. The effects of temperature on wire tension were removed by post−processing with a regression−based empirical protocol, which corrected the raw data to a standard temperature. Because data were averaged over 15 min, wind gusts appeared to have little measurable effect on the tension measurement. A smoothing algorithm removed remaining transient disturbances in the data without masking signifi-cant events like crop thinning or harvest. Results to date suggest a linear relationship between wire tension and fruit mass that varies among rows, but not within a row, during a single season. Yields were between 4. 5 and 20. 2 t ha− 1 (2 to 9 t acre− 1) ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Pharmacologic therapies {{to prevent}} stroke in atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) have numerous limitations, prompting {{the development of}} device-based therapies. We investigated whether an electrogram-based approach using a novel hollow suture can safely capture and ligate the left atrial appendage (LAA). Methods and Results: A novel system for closure of the LAA {{within the confines of}} the closed pericardium with a single sheath puncture was tested in 4 dogs. the tool used to grasp the appendage was fitted with electrodes and utilized electrical navigation to identify and confirm LAA capture. A hollow suture preloaded with a mechanical <b>support</b> <b>wire</b> to permit its manipulation and fluoroscopic visualization was advanced over the grasper, and the wire removed after the suture was positioned. the LAA was successfully closed in all dogs. in 2 dogs, after closure, a thoracotomy was performed and the LAA amputated without bleeding, confirming closure integrity. Necropsy confirmed closure in all animals. Conclusions: Using electrical navigation, percutaneous epicardial LAA ligation with a remotely tightened suture was performed successfully {{within the confines of the}} intact pericardial space. This technique may allow decreasing the risk of stroke in AF patients without the need for thoracotomy or an endocardially placed prosthetic device.
