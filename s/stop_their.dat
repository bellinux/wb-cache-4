5|$|Expedition to the Barrier Peaks {{takes place}} on a {{spaceship}} in the Barrier Peaks mountain range of the World of Greyhawk campaign setting. In the adventure's introduction, it is explained that the Grand Duchy of Geoff is under constant attack by a succession of monsters that have been emerging from a cave in the mountains. The Grand Duke of Geoff has hired the characters to discover {{the origin of the}} creatures, and <b>stop</b> <b>their</b> incursions.|$|E
5|$|Following Khumarawayh's {{ascension}} {{to power}} in 884, the Abbasid central government decided to reassert its control over the provinces ruled by him and invaded northern Syria that year. By early 885 the conflict was proceeding favorably for the Abbasids, forcing Khumarawayh to personally take the field and try to <b>stop</b> <b>their</b> advance toward Egypt. In the battle that followed, the Abbasid troops initially defeated the Tulunids and plundered Khumarawayh's camp, but were then ambushed by a Tulunid reserve force and routed in turn.|$|E

Mulder destroys the platform's radio {{so that the}} black oil-infected crew cannot communicate with the aliens. Suddenly, the platform workers <b>stop</b> <b>their</b> attack and begin to sabotage the rig. Doggett and Mulder leave the radio room, and jump off the rig when they realize that the crew are going to destroy it. They are rescued by the helicopters Kersh has sent to break the quarantine. Later, at the FBI, Mulder tells Doggett {{that he has been}} dismissed from the bureau.|$|E

5|$|After his {{problems}} in the first session, Vettel was fastest in the second session on Friday afternoon. Nico Rosberg was second, about {{a tenth of a}} second behind, but did not set any timed laps in the last twenty minutes as his car was losing gearbox oil. Lewis Hamilton meanwhile struggled on the super-soft tyres, making several errors that left him fifth. Both Lotus cars made it into the top ten, with Pastor Maldonado and Romain Grosjean in fourth and seventh respectively. Max Verstappen's Toro Rosso was the fastest Renault-powered car in eighth position, while the McLarens once again had to <b>stop</b> <b>their</b> session early.|$|E
5|$|After the lynchings {{of their}} {{prominent}} competitors, the WSGA's {{control over the}} range was undisputed, until a group of smaller ranchers led by a local cowboy named Nate Champion formed the Northern Wyoming Farmers and Stock Growers' Association (NWFSGA) {{to compete with the}} WSGA. Upon hearing this, the WSGA immediately viewed Champion's association as a threat to their hold on the stock interests. The WSGA then blacklisted members of the NWFSGA from the round-ups in order to <b>stop</b> <b>their</b> operations. However, the latter refused the orders to disband and instead publicly announced their plans to hold their own round-up in the spring of 1892.|$|E

5|$|As {{the battle}} around Taechon {{dragged into the}} night of November 26, the ROK 11th Infantry Regiment on the division's right became disorganized. Brigadier General Paik Sun Yup of the ROK 1st Infantry Division soon brought up the 15th Infantry Regiment from his reserve to relieve the 11th Infantry Regiment. After {{receiving}} news on the Chinese attack against the 25th Division across the Kuryong River, Paik had also directed his division to defend against the upcoming Chinese counteroffensive. As the morning came on November 27, the Chinese troops around Taechon did not <b>stop</b> <b>their</b> assault even under punishing UN air strikes, {{and some of the}} attacks spilled into US 24th Infantry Division's area. Upon noticing their flank was buckling, the US 24th Infantry Division and the US 35th Infantry Regiment started the retreat southward to the Ch'ongch'on River.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, {{the worker}} shares {{half of her}} genes with her sons and only a quarter with her brothers. Furthermore, the workers in colonies with a single once-mated queen are related to their nephews by three eighths, higher than they are related to brothers. This results in a {{conflict}} where the queen and worker females are at odds over the proportion of male offspring they contribute, since each side tries to maximize its reproductive fitness. Queens favor production of their own sons while workers favor production of their own sons, and do not <b>stop</b> <b>their</b> sisters from laying because of the favorable relatedness to nephews.|$|E
5|$|Fertility {{awareness}} methods involve {{determining the}} most fertile {{days of the}} menstrual cycle and avoiding unprotected intercourse. Techniques for determining fertility include monitoring basal body temperature, cervical secretions, or {{the day of the}} cycle. They have typical first-year failure rates of 24%; perfect use first-year failure rates depend on which method is used and range from 0.4% to 5%. The evidence on which these estimates are based, however, is poor as the majority of people in trials <b>stop</b> <b>their</b> use early. Globally, they are used by about 3.6% of couples. If based on both basal body temperature and another primary sign, the method is referred to as symptothermal. Overall first-year failure rates of <2% to 20% have been reported in clinical studies of the symptothermal method.|$|E

5|$|Julian offers Theo {{money to}} acquire transit papers {{for a young}} refugee named Kee, which Theo obtains from his cousin Nigel, a {{government}} minister who runs a state-sponsored collection of salvaged art from around the world. The transit papers require that the bearer must be accompanied, so Theo agrees to escort Kee {{in exchange for a}} large sum. Luke, a Fishes member, drives them and former midwife Miriam towards the coast to a boat. They are ambushed by an armed gang, and Julian is killed. Luke kills two police officers who <b>stop</b> <b>their</b> car, and they bury Julian in the forest as Theo breaks down crying over her death. The group ditches their car for another to escape to a Fishes safe house.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, TGS star Jenna Maroney's (Jane Krakowski) {{dressing}} room {{is now a}} temporary room for a technician (Meng Ai) as Jack is renting space on the TGS floor in the 30 Rock building to keep the budget down, as a result Jenna is forced to share a {{dressing room}} with her TGS co-star Danny Baker (Cheyenne Jackson). Immediately, the two start behaving like an old married couple. NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) gets upset about Jenna and Danny fighting and decides to <b>stop</b> <b>their</b> bickering. Kenneth interrupts one of their arguments by showing them a childish picture he drew of the two. This works to no avail as Jenna and Danny continue arguing. To {{put a stop to}} this, Danny moves out from his dressing room and into the Y.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad had preached the {{religion}} of Islam in Mecca from 613 to 622. He had attracted a small community of followers, but also drew staunch opposition {{from the rest of}} the Quraysh, the tribe that ruled Mecca and to which he belonged. The Muslims fled Mecca in 622 after years of persecution and established themselves at Medina (formerly known as Yathrib; Medina means City). The Quraysh had seized the properties and families of Muslims in Mecca and dispatched caravans to Damascus which the Muslims intercepted and raided. The Meccans sent out a small army to punish the Muslims and <b>stop</b> <b>their</b> raiding. At the Battle of Badr in 623, a small Muslim force defeated the much larger Meccan army.|$|E

5|$|On the West German side, {{there were}} no fortifications of any kind, nor even any patrol roads in most areas. Warning signs (Grenzschilder) with {{messages}} such as Achtung! Zonengrenze! ("Danger! Zonal border!") or Halt! Hier Zonengrenze ("Stop! Zonal border here") notified visitors. Foreign military personnel were restricted from approaching the border to avoid clashes or other unwanted incidents. Signs in English and German provided notifications of {{the distance to the}} border to prevent accidental crossings. No such restriction applied to Western civilians, who were free {{to go up to the}} border line, and {{there were no}} physical obstacles to <b>stop</b> <b>their</b> crossing it.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} two weeks more skirmishes {{occurred}} and the Allies were not able to cut off a major portion of the German forces, but the Germans were also not able to maintain any stable defense line as planned. On 10September forward units of the VI Corps were able to establish contact with units from Patton's Third Army. Truscott hoped to be able to push through the Belfort Gap, but on 14September he received orders from the Allied High Command to halt the offensive. Army GroupG was finally able to establish a stable defense line at the Vosges mountains, thwarting further Allied advances. This, combined with the Allied need to reorganise their command structure as the forces from northern and southern France have now linked up, forced the Allies to <b>stop</b> <b>their</b> pursuit of the Germans, ending the offensive here.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} an eight-player co-operative multiplayer mode called the Chaos Squad, which tasks players {{to complete a}} series of missions, as decided by the players themselves. Players defend vats of Overcharge Delirium XT from waves of OD'd at night and <b>stop</b> <b>their</b> progression by setting up fortifications and barriers, {{in a manner similar}} to tower defense games. It is inter-connected with the single-player mode allowing players to transfer their story character, with all the weapons and gadgets they have already accumulated, to the mode. Although players work together, players also try to earn more Style points during play than their co-op partners.|$|E

5|$|Deep Purple {{arrived in}} California on 15 October 1968 and their first public {{appearance}} on American soil was at The Dating Game TV show on ABC on 17 October. They {{were the first}} rock band to perform on the show, where Jon Lord {{was one of the}} contestants. The next two days the band played live in the US {{for the first time as}} supporting act of Cream in their Goodbye tour. The concerts were held at the Inglewood Forum near Los Angeles, California, in front of more than 16,000 people every night. Recordings of those live shows were issued in 2002 as Inglewood – Live in California. The next gig at San Diego was the last one supporting Cream, whose management apparently did not appreciate the cheerful reaction of the audience to Deep Purple and dropped them. After a week of forced <b>stop,</b> <b>their</b> American manager succeeded in setting up a tour which included the San Francisco International Pop Festival and venues on the West Coast. This opportunity was very useful for the young musicians, who as headliners could lengthen their live shows up to 90 minutes and gained much needed experience on the road. This was particularly true for Blackmore, who developed and extended his guitar solos, incorporating more improvisations.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to halt the North Vietnamese assault, Luat ordered two squadrons of M-113 {{armoured}} personnel carriers to confront the enemy at Nga Sau, but {{they were forced to}} turn back by tanks from the North Vietnamese 3rd Tank Battalion, 273rd Armoured Regiment. At around 5:30pm, a South Vietnamese ranger battalion was forced to abandon the nearby installation at Dac Lac after continuous assaults from the 95B Regiment. In the northeast, the South Vietnamese 9th Ranger Battalion held off the North Vietnamese 95B Regiment until they abandoned their positions on the next day. In the western outskirts of Ban Me Thuot, eight A-37 Dragonfly bombers from the South Vietnamese 6th Air Force Division inflicted light casualties on the North Vietnamese 24th Regiment, but failed to <b>stop</b> <b>their</b> enemies’ momentum. In the southwest, Quang tried to retake Mai Hac De by mobilising his reserve units with tactical air support. Meanwhile, in the south-eastern end of Ban Me Thuot, the North Vietnamese 149th Regiment defeated the South Vietnamese 53rd Infantry Regiment, after they sustained heavy casualties from repeated air attacks from A-37 bombers.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) demands {{compensation}} for her voice work in Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) pornographic video game, Gorgasm: The Legend of Dong Slayer. The argument escalates and Liz orders them to <b>stop</b> <b>their</b> bickering. After Liz leaves for Chicago, Jenna and Tracy decide {{to conduct a}} social experiment to see whether Tracy can survive better as a white woman than Jenna can as a black man, after arguing respectively that black men and white women have it harder in society. Later, while on her flight, Liz takes Jack's sedative. Liz realizes that the woman {{sitting next to her}} is Oprah Winfrey. When Liz arrives back at the 30 Rock studios, Tracy is dressed in female drag with his body covered in white makeup and soon after, Jenna enters in blackface and male drag. Jack worries that the situation has gone out of control, but Liz assures him that Oprah, who is coming to the studios, {{will be able to make}} them come to terms. As it turns out, her inflight conversation with Oprah was a hallucination. The person who Liz thought was Oprah is actually a 12-year-old girl named Pam (Raven Goodwin). Even so, Pam engages Tracy and Jenna in a heart-to-heart, and manages to settle their differences.|$|E
