5|$|After the Battle of Edington in 878, Alfred {{established}} {{a network of}} fortified settlements, called burhs, in Wessex to protect his people and territory against Viking attacks, and when Æthelred accepted Alfred's lordship the burhs were extended into Mercia.

Steven Plunkett suggests that the founding of Gipeswic took place under Wuffingas supervision. It took another hundred years for the <b>settlement</b> <b>to</b> develop into a town, but its beginnings can be seen as a reflection of the personal importance of Rædwald during the period of his supremacy.|$|E
