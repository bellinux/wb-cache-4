We investigate their prediction of important employee work attitudes, citizenship behaviors, and performance. Based on data from 448 employees, empirical tests support the existence of organization- and supervisor-directed social exchanges. Tests using structural equation modeling support unique predictions of attitudinal and behavioral work outcomes. <b>Social</b> exchanges <b>POS</b> LMX Psychological contracts Trust Employee attitudes and behaviors...|$|R

40|$|Data of {{this study}} were {{collected}} from 239 supervisor-subordinate dyads working in a foreign-invested enterprise in China. Structural equation modeling and hierarchical multiple regression analyses were employed to test the hypotheses. Results showed that procedural justice, informational justice, and distributive justice contributed positively to POS. POS was positively related to social exchange, and negatively related to economic exchange. Furthermore, both social exchange and economic exchange acted as the mediators on the relationship between POS with affective commitment, but not on the relationship between POS with in-role performance and organizational citizenship behavior. Discussions are made on the study's findings as well as its theoretical and practical implications. Limitations of the study and future research directions are also suggested. Past research on employee-organization exchange relationships mostly used perceived organizational support (<b>POS)</b> to represent <b>social</b> exchange relationship. Such approach confuses the conceptual meanings of <b>POS</b> and <b>social</b> exchange, and excludes economic exchange in the analysis of employment relationships. The roles of <b>POS,</b> <b>social</b> exchange, and economic exchange have not been properly specified and examined in a conceptual model. In addition, research on POS focuses on procedural justice and hence neglects the roles of other types of justice perceptions (e. g., distributive justice and informational justice) as antecedents of employees' outcomes. This limits our full understanding of the determinants, process, and consequences of exchange relationships between employees and their organization. To fill the above research voids, this study develops a comprehensive model to examine the relationships among organizational justice, <b>POS,</b> <b>social</b> and economic exchanges, and three major employees' outcomes (i. e., affective commitment, in-role performance, and organizational citizenship behavior). In view of the unique characteristics and dynamic changes in employment relationships, China has been chosen as the research site. Loi Chi Ho. "August 2006. "Adviser: Hang-Yue Ngo.

40|$|A psicologia ocupou um papel importante na sociedade durante o século XX, ajudando a construir o mundo e as pessoas em que nos transformamos. Nesse sentido, constituiu-se como uma "ciência social", promovendo uma "psicologização" das vidas {{individual}} e coletiva, inventando e transformando diversas idéias em termos psicológicos. Este texto busca compreender esta caminhada da psicologia, que encontrou seu espaço como uma técnica de regulamentação, um pretenso conhecimento sobre as pessoas com o objetivo institucional de administrá-las, moldá-las, reformá-las. Passa pela psicologia <b>social</b> do <b>pós</b> primeira e segunda guerras, com suas pesquisas de atitudes e trabalhos sobre grupos, culminando na noção de empreendimento, construindo e regulando as ações humanas. Termina problematizando a primazia do corpo biológico no século XXI, onde as novas tecnologias de imagem, a psiquiatria biológica, a neuroquímica e a neurobiologia emergem, na mesma medida em que uma "subjetividade cerebral" se fortalece.

This text aims at understanding this evolution of psychology which found its space as a regulation technique, a presumed knowledge about people with an institutional objective of managing, shaping and reforming them. It discusses social psychology of post-war periods with its attitude researches and works about groups; reaching its climax with the notion of enterprise, building and regulating human actions.

It is a reflection on the struggles, sustaining forces, and legacy passed on by women of color, who are social work educators to future generations of women. Framed by feminist theory and the theory of intersectionality, the narratives of 16 women of color are points of reflection. The findings of their narratives affirm multiple barriers and challenges, sustaining forces, and the legacy passed on by these pioneers to future generations. Implications for policy, practice, and research are also discussed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to compare behavioral management aspects of the organizational effectiveness between lean implemented textile firms and apparel firms in Sri Lanka. The organizational effectiveness is measured through Participation in Decision Making (PDM), Perceived Organizational Support (<b>POS),</b> <b>Social</b> Exchange Process (SEP), Economic Exchange Process (EEP), Effective Commitment (AC), Continuance Commitment (CC), Job Satisfaction (JS), Turnover Intention(TI) and Job Involvement (Jl). Although numerous empirical studies pertaining to the textile and apparel industry has been published, relatively little is known about behavioral management concepts in textile and apparel firms in Sri Lanka. Many elements of the present consensus developed from studies of West may not be directly applicable to developing countries. It is likely that differences in macro-environmental factors, such as national culture, may render the commonly accepted Western notions of behavioral management concepts less appropriate in Asian developing nations such as Sri Lanka. A sample of four textile firms and four apparel firms that have implemented lean manufacturing techniques was selected for the study. A random sample of 358 shop-floor employees from the above eight firms responded. The self-administrated survey questionnaire was used for data collection. The data analysis was conducted using SPSS. The findings showed significant differences between textile firms and apparel firms in terms of organizational effectiveness. For all the concepts tested, lean implemented apparel firms showed better organizational effectiveness than lean implemented textile firms...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} how social exchanges modify the relationship between psychological contract breach and work performance. It aims to present two concurrent hypotheses, based on theoretical interaction effects of social exchanges (conceptualized as <b>social</b> exchange relationships, <b>POS,</b> and trust). Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from a sample of 266 employees in a service sector company in the USA. Regression analysis was used to explore the moderating effects of social exchanges on the relationships between psychological contract breach and work performance (operationalized as in-role behaviors and organizational citizenship behaviors). Findings: It was found that the negative relationship between psychological contract breach and work performance was moderated by social exchanges, such that the relationship was stronger for employees with high social exchange relationship, perceived organizational support, and trust. Research limitations/implications: The data were collected cross-sectionally, and thus causal inferences have to be made with caution. Moreover, the data were collected from a single source. The study shows that the relations between contract breach and outcomes are moderated by the existing relationship between employee and organization. Practical implications: Although organizations may invest in long-term relationships with their employees, psychological contract breaches have a profound impact on work performance. Therefore, organizations should diminish perceptions of contract breach; for instance by providing realistic expectations. Originality/value: The paper provides new theoretical insights on how social exchange can have two distinct effects on the breach-outcomes relations. It shows that social exchanges moderate the relations between contract breach and work performance. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|R

Focalizaremos as condições de trabalho e suas as demandas em face dos limites estabelecidos com a desestruturação do seu espaço institucional oriundos das Contra-Reformas do Estado e da Previdência Social. Na década de 1990, houve a adesão do Brasil à política neoliberal, o que configurou uma nova organização do trabalho e uma nova atuação do Estado. Dentro desse contexto, foi realizada a Contra-Reforma com ênfase nas privatizações, Reforma da Previdência e do aparelho do Estado, dentre outras ações. Particularmente, na Previdência a reforma trouxe profundas conseqüências para os Assistentes Sociais do INSS, dentre elas: redução no quadro de profissionais e no espaço institucional. Assim, situamos o Assistente Social da Previdência diante das modificações contemporâneas no mundo do trabalho, como também diante das conseqüências advindas das Contra-Reformas implementadas e executadas pelos governos neoliberais no país como forma de se enquadrar e adentrar ao mundo globalizado e à nova ordem do capital.
