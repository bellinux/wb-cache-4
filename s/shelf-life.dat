25|$|After packaging, {{the bottles}} are {{immediately}} sealed {{to retain the}} freshness and preserve the <b>shelf-life</b> of the product. The final step is cooling the product via cold air or water to maintain its flavour.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to their}} {{susceptibility}} to oxidation from {{the exposure to}} oxygen, heat and light, resulting {{in the formation of}} oxidation products such as inflammatory lipid peroxides and hydroperoxides, plant oils rich in polyunsatured fatty acids have a limited <b>shelf-life.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cost and {{shelf life}} – Many sugar {{substitutes}} are cheaper than sugar. Sugar substitutes are often lower in total cost {{because of their}} long <b>shelf-life</b> and high sweetening intensity. This allows sugar substitutes {{to be used in}} products that will not perish after a short period of time.|$|E
25|$|Acidifiers, {{most often}} lactic or citric acid, can impart a tangy or tart flavor note, extend <b>shelf-life,</b> tenderize fresh meat or help with protein {{denaturation}} and moisture release in dried meat. They {{substitute for the}} process of natural fermentation that acidifies some meat products such as hard salami or prosciutto.|$|E
25|$|As mentioned, lifestyle- and obesity-related {{diseases}} {{are becoming increasingly}} prevalent all around the world. There {{is little doubt that}} the increasingly widespread application of some modern food processing technologies has contributed to this development. The food processing industry is a major part of modern economy, and as such it is influential in political decisions (e.g., nutritional recommendations, agricultural subsidising). In any known profit-driven economy, health considerations are hardly a priority; effective production of cheap foods with a long <b>shelf-life</b> is more the trend. In general, whole, fresh foods have a relatively short <b>shelf-life</b> and are less profitable to produce and sell than are more processed foods. Thus, the consumer is left with the choice between more expensive, but nutritionally superior, whole, fresh foods, and cheap, usually nutritionally inferior, processed foods. Because processed foods are often cheaper, more convenient (in both purchasing, storage, and preparation), and more available, the consumption of nutritionally inferior foods has been increasing throughout the world along with many nutrition-related health complications.|$|E
25|$|Homogenization is {{a process}} that reduces the size of fat {{globules}} by forcing pressurized, hot milk through small holes, causing turbulence that breaks up the larger fat globules so that they remain suspended rather than separating in a cream layer at the top. The purpose of homogenization is to make milk more convenient to process, store and consume, eliminating the need to shake or stir the milk container to remix the separated cream layer and increasing the <b>shelf-life</b> of the product.|$|E
25|$|In {{at least}} one case, the {{popularity}} of a game featured in Let's Plays has led to further sales far after the game's typical <b>shelf-life</b> has expired. In 2014, Electronic Arts opted to print more copies of the 2010 title Skate 3 after its appearance on PewDiePie's and other Let's Play channels have kept sales of the game high, keeping it in the top 40 sales charts for new games in the United Kingdom and with its 2014 sales being 33% higher than 2013 sales.|$|E
25|$|Storage {{times can}} be tested using {{accelerated}} <b>shelf-life</b> testing, which requires storage without applied voltage at the upper category temperature for a certain period, usually 1000 hours. This shelf life test is a good indicator for chemical stability and of the oxide layer, because all chemical reactions are accelerated by higher temperatures. Nearly all commercial series of non-solid electrolytics fulfill the 1000 hour shelf life test. However, many series are specified only for two years of storage. This also ensures the continuing solderability of the terminals.|$|E
25|$|Fermentation {{is one of}} {{the methods}} to {{preserve}} food and alter its quality. Yeast, especially Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is used to leaven bread, brew beer and make wine. Certain bacteria, including lactic acid bacteria, are used to make yogurt, cheese, hot sauce, pickles, fermented sausages and dishes such as kimchi. A common effect of these fermentations is that the food product is less hospitable to other microorganisms, including pathogens and spoilage-causing microorganisms, thus extending the food's <b>shelf-life.</b> Some cheese varieties also require molds to ripen and develop their characteristic flavors.|$|E
25|$|The {{stability}} of these aromas is very {{dependent on the}} amount of anthocyanins and other phenolics that protect these compounds from oxidation. One of the reasons why rosés have such a very limited <b>shelf-life</b> is because of their low phenolic levels due to the very limited skin contact and extraction time. Usually within a year of production the levels of 3-mercaptohexanol-1-ol in the wine have dropped to half its fermentation levels with the presence of 3-mercaptohenyl acetate undetectable in most wines. This is why most wine experts recommend that rosés are consumed as soon after release as possible.|$|E
25|$|Many {{vaccines}} need preservatives {{to prevent}} serious adverse effects such as Staphylococcus infection, which in one 1928 incident killed 12 of 21 children inoculated with a diphtheria vaccine that lacked a preservative. Several preservatives are available, including thiomersal, phenoxyethanol, and formaldehyde. Thiomersal {{is more effective}} against bacteria, has a better <b>shelf-life,</b> and improves vaccine stability, potency, and safety; but, in the U.S., the European Union, {{and a few other}} affluent countries, it is no longer used as a preservative in childhood vaccines, as a precautionary measure due to its mercury content. Although controversial claims have been made that thiomersal contributes to autism, no convincing scientific evidence supports these claims.|$|E
25|$|The Feast of San Diego de Alcala is commemorated every November 12 in Poblacion. This is {{a celebration}} of the feast of the oldest church in Valenzuela which {{includes}} annual boat racing, street dancing and different fabulous activities of the festival. As part of the San Diego de Alcala Feast Day, a unique food festival in the country is celebrated which features the famous putong Polo, the small but classy kakanin which was originally created in the town of Polo. This rice cake was a recipient of Manuel Quezon Presidential Award in 1931 which was cited having its exotic taste and amazingly long <b>shelf-life.</b> The celebration, known as Putong Polo Festival includes a parade featuring artistic creations from the rice cake which showcases creativity among the residents.|$|E
25|$|Rosés can be {{produced}} {{in a variety of}} ways with the most common method being early pressing of red grape varieties after a very short period, usually 12–24 hours, of skin-contact (maceration). During maceration, phenolics such as the anthocyanins and tannins that contribute to color as well as many flavor components are leached from the skins, seeds and any stems left in contact with the must. In addition to adding color and flavor, these phenolics also serve as antioxidants, protecting the wine from degradation of oxygen exposure. While red wines will often have maceration last several days to even several weeks, the very limited maceration of rosés means that these wines will have less stable color, potential flavor components and oxygen protection. This contributes to wines with shorter <b>shelf-life</b> that are meant to be consumed soon after release.|$|E

2500|$|Pasteurization is {{credited}} with dramatically reducing pathogens found in milk. This improves the <b>shelf-life</b> and safety of the processed milk.
