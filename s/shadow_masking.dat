A well-developed thin film fabrication procedure utilizing <b>shadow</b> <b>masking</b> for patterning the sensors elements had produced thin films with sufficient durability for applications in high temperature and pressure environments {{that exist in}} air-breathing and hydrogen-fueled burner rig and engine test facilities.

We show that the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> can be {{generated}} in the alpha channel {{or even in the}} screen buffer, if a hardware accelerated stencil buffer is not available. In comparison to the original stencil buffer method, a small speed up can be achieved, if the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> is computed in the alpha buffer. The method using the screen buffer requires the scene to be rendered a second time after the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> has been computed. Both methods are less restrictive with respect to hardware requirements, since we use only standard color blending and depth testing. In general, rasterization bandwidth is the main bottle neck when generating the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> at high screen resolutions. In order to overcome this bottle neck we propose a way to compute the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> at a resolution that is lower than the resolution of the screen buffer.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{fabrication of}} organic laterally-patterned microcavity devices with lateral sizes on the micron scale using PDMS lift-off patterning. Recently, low-threshold lasing was demonstrated from pillars formed by thermally evaporating thin films of Alq 3 (aluminum tris(8 -hydroxyquinoline)) doped with the laser dye DCM (4 -(dicyanomethylene) - 2 -methyl- 6 -(4 -dimethylaminostyryl) - 4 H-pyran) through thin nickel shadow masks with square, 5 - x 5 -mm 2 openings [1]. Additionally, recent research efforts in microcavity exciton-polariton devices based on inorganic active {{materials such as}} GaAs or CdTe quantum wells {{have focused on the}} lateral patterning of microcavity exciton-polariton systems [2]. Such 0 D cavities allow for symmetry-breaking of the in-plane wave vector, opening new pathways for parametric generation of photon pairs [3]. For the same reason, laterally-patterned organic microcavity exciton-polariton devices are also of interest. The PDMS lift-off patterning, as opposed to <b>shadow</b> <b>masking,</b> allows standard lithography techniques to be used to define pattern features in silicon PDMS molds [4], [5]. Additionally, smaller features than are achievable through <b>shadow</b> <b>masking</b> are theoretically feasible even with PDMS due to the generally low aspect ratio in PDMS needed for embossing small features on the patterned organic film. We use PDMS lift-off patterning of a thin film of thermally-evaporated TPD (N'-bis(3 -methylphenyl) -N,N'-diphenyl- 1, 1 '-biphenyl- 4, 4 '-diamine) doped with DCM to form embossed pillars in the TPD film of 20 - 25 nm in thickness. Figure 1 a shows the device structure, Figure 1 b shows PDMS lift-off patterning technique, and Figure 1 c shows the molecular diagrams of the device constituents. When the sample is optically excited with a λ= 408 nm light source, emission from both the unpatterned (λ~ 630 nm) and patterned areas (λ~ 655 nm) is observed, as seen in Figure 2. The background emission dominates since its cavity resonance is closer to the resonance of DCM, as shown; use of different organic materials with larger lift-off amounts can increase this wavelength shift...|$|E
