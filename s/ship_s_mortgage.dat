40|$|Fixed-rate {{mortgages}} (FRMs) {{dominate the}} U. <b>S.</b> <b>mortgage</b> market, with important consequences for household risk management, monetary policy, and systemic risk. In this paper, {{we show that}} securitization is a key driver of FRM supply. Our analysis compares the agency and nonagency mortgage-backed-securities (MBS) markets, exploiting the freeze in nonagency MBS liquidity {{in the third quarter}} of 2007. Using exogenous variation in access to the agency MBS market, we find that when both market segments are liquid they perform similarly in terms of supporting FRM supply. However, after the nonagency market freezes, the share of FRMs is sharply higher among mortgages eligible to be securitized through the still-liquid agency MBS market. Our interpretation is that securitization is particularly important for FRMs because of the prepayment and interest rate risk embedded in these loans. We highlight policy implications for ongoing reform of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>mortgage</b> finance system...|$|R

The results are consistent with the notion that a relaxation of lending standards, triggered by an increased demand for loans, contributed to the boom and the ensuing crisis, together with other supply-side explanations.

40|$|Home {{mortgages}} have loomed continually {{larger in}} the financial situation of American households. In 1949, mortgage debt was equal to 20 percent of total household income; by 1979, it had risen to 46 percent of income; by 2001, 73 percent of income (Bernstein, Boushey and Mishel, 2003). Similarly, mortgage debt was 15 percent of household assets in 1949, but rose to 28 percent of household assets by 1979 and 41 percent of household assets by 2001. This enormous growth of American home mortgages, as shown in Figure 1 (as a percentage of GDP), {{has been accompanied by}} a transformation in their form such that American mortgages are now distinctively different from mortgages {{in the rest of the}} world. In addition, the growth in mortgage debt outstanding in the United States has closely tracked the mortgage market’s increased reliance on securitization (Cho, 2004). The structure of the modern American mortgage has evolved over time. We begin by describing this historical evolution. The U. <b>S.</b> <b>mortgage</b> before the 1930 s would be nearly unrecognizable today: it featured variable interest rates, high down payments and short maturities. Before the Great Depression, homeowners typically renegotiated their loans every year. We next compare the form of U. <b>S.</b> home <b>mortgages</b> today with those in other countries. The U. <b>S.</b> <b>mortgage</b> provides many more options to borrowers than are commonly provided elsewhere: American homebuyers can choose whether to pay a fixed or floating rate of interest; they can lock in their interest rate in between the time they apply for the mortgage and the time they purchase their house; they can choose the time at which the mortgage rate resets; they can choose the term and the amortization period; they can prepay freely; and they can generally borrow against home equity freely. They can also obtain home mortgages at attractive terms with very low down payments. We discuss the nature of the U.

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{theoretical}} {{model of a}} network of intermediaries, which we apply to the U. <b>S.</b> <b>mortgage</b> supply chain. In our model, heterogeneous financial norms and systemic vulnerabil-ities arise endogenously. Intuitively, the optimal behavior of each intermediary, in terms of its attitude toward risk, the quality of the projects that it undertakes, and the intermediaries it chooses to interact with, is influenced by the behavior of its prospective counterparties. These network effects, together with intrinsic quality differences between intermediaries, jointly deter-mine financial health and systemic vulnerability at the aggregate level as well as for individual intermediaries. We apply our model to the mortgage-origination and securitization network of financial intermediaries, using a large data set of more than twelve million mortgages orig-inated and securitized through the private-label supply chain from 2002 – 2007. We then track the ex-post foreclosure performance of each loan in the network and compare the evolution of credit risk by vintage with the model’s predictions. We find that credit risk evolves in a concentrated manner among highly linked nodes, defined by the geography of the network and the interactions between originator and counterparty over time. This confirms that network effects are of vital importance for understanding the U. <b>S.</b> <b>mortgage</b> supply chain.

40|$|Successful {{privatization}} must {{be accompanied}} by the complete removal of privileges and any public policy mission. Bank behavior changes rapidly as profit maximation replaces the bureaucratic objective function. Once privileges are granted, they are difficult to remove. Therefore, privatization is a one-time (nonreversible) operation. The German mortgage bank, DePfa, went through a carefully planned and lengthy privatization process that was successful. Fannie Mae, the U. <b>S.</b> <b>mortgage</b> firm, became a privately owned institution endowed with special privileges, which led to a quasi-monopoly position.

Because credit market imperfections mute this effect, the extent to which house spending predicts future income measures the "imperfectness" of mortgage markets.

It is important to note, however,that prior to the growth of subprime lending in the 1990 <b>s,</b> U. <b>S.</b> <b>mortgage</b> markets already reached low and moderate-income households without taking large risks or suffering large losses. In contrast, in most emerging markets, mortgage finance is a luxury good, restricted to upper income households. As policy makers in emerging market seek to move lenders down market, they should adopt policies that include a variety of financing methods and should allow for rental or purchase as a function of the financial capacity of the household. Securitization remains a useful tool when developed in the context of well-aligned incentives and oversight. It is possible to extend mortgage lending down market without repeating the mistakes of the subprime boom and bust.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} contributes three {{essays in}} areas of mortgage risk that are rapidly growing in importance. The first essay develops a fully dynamic optimization model for a borrower's redefault decision on a modified mortgage incorporating real-world frictions relevant for default decisions. Solutions to the model reveal large differences across modification structures and a basic pecking order for redefault performance controlling for resulting mortgage present value. Further, empirical tests utilizing unique and extensive data on modified loans offer broad agreement with the predictions of the model. The second essay provides {{one of the most}} complete studies for termination behavior of non-U. <b>S.</b> <b>mortgages</b> to date, jointly estimating the competing risks of prepayment and default in a grouped duration mixed proportional hazard framework applied to Singapore mortgages. The study tests option-theoretic motivations for prepayments and defaults as well as "trigger event" explanations, explores comparative results to U. <b>S.</b> <b>mortgage</b> studies, examines unique institutional characteristics of this market impacting option-theoretic motivations for loan termination, and documents that variation in sources of borrower equity matter for the exercise of default options. The final essay argues that the estimation of tail credit risk in residential mortgage portfolios remains relatively poorly understood, and that many common approaches to the problem have been incomplete or inadequate. In addition to laying out the fundamental components of sound portfolio credit risk assessment, the essay develops competing models for realistic dynamics of underlying risk factors, such as home prices. Particular attention is paid to identifying the properties of these models most consequential for the estimated distribution of losses, and to measures of implied sensitivity to geographic diversification...|$|R
