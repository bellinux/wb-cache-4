40|$|Abstract In 2014, the Bank of England on {{recommendation}} from the Financial Policy Committee {{carried out the}} UK variant of stress test. Eight major banks in the UK namely Barclays, the Co- operative Bank, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Nationwide Building Society, Royal Bank of Scotland, Standard Charter and Santander UK {{were included in the}} stress test owing to their systematic importance in the sector. While all the banks except Co- operative bank were found to be capital adequate, the Bank of England stress test did not include the efficiency level of these banks under the <b>stress</b> <b>scenario.</b> As the smooth running of any economy largely depends on the efficiency of its financial institutions, especially banks, it becomes imperative to check if the banks in UK would continue to remain cost efficiency under <b>stress</b> <b>scenario.</b> Thus, the present study uses Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) Approach to compare the level of cost x- efficiency of banks in the UK when <b>stress</b> <b>scenario</b> is introduced to the macro economic variables. The empirical results suggest that although there is a minor decrease in the level of cost x- efficiency of banks under adverse macroeconomic conditions, there is no major threat to the efficient working of banks overall. In other words, banks in the UK were found to be fairly efficient and resilient to the stress in environmental variables...|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the technique of}} worst case search to macro stress testing. Among the macroeconomic scenarios satisfying some plausibility constraint we determine the worst case scenario which causes the most harmful loss in loan portfolios. This method has three advantages over traditional macro stress testing: First, it ensures that no harmful scenarios are missed and therefore prevents a false illusion of safety which may result when considering only standard <b>stress</b> <b>scenarios.</b> Second, it does not analyse scenarios which are too implausible and would therefore jeopardize the credibility of stress analysis. Third, it allows for a portfolio specific identification of key risk factors. Another lesson from this paper relates {{to the use of}} partial <b>stress</b> <b>scenarios</b> specifying the values of some but not all risk factors: The plausibility of partial scenarios is maximised if we set the remaining risk factors to their conditional expected values. ...|$|R

Based on the framework, the paper proposes a new approach for systemic risk stress-testing and recapitalization policy that ensure the banking system is robust to a wide set of shocks, but minimizes the costs of achieving robustness through better sharing of risk. In addition, the systemic risk framework is used to examine how risks should be shared among banks to achieve systemic risk reduction...|$|R

The severity of the impact of the bank run increases with the size of the bank; large banks are the most vulnerable.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a method for}} selecting and analysing <b>stress</b> <b>scenarios</b> for financial risk assessment, with particular emphasis on identifying sensible combinations of stresses to multiple factors. We focus primarily on reverse stress testing – finding the most likely scenarios leading to losses exceeding a given threshold. We approach this problem using a nonparametric empirical likelihood estimator of the conditional mean of the underlying market factors given large losses. We then scale confidence regions for the conditional mean by a coefficient {{that depends on the}} tails of the market factors to estimate the most likely loss scenarios. We provide rigorous justification for the confidence regions and the scaling procedure when the joint distribution of the market factors and portfolio loss is elliptically contoured. We explicitly characterize the impact of the heaviness of the tails of the distribution, contrasting a broad spectrum of cases including exponential tails and regularly varying tails. The key to this analysis lies in the asymptotics of the conditional variances and covariances in extremes. These results also lead to asymptotics for marginal expected shortfall and the corresponding variance, conditional on a market stress; we combine these results with empirical likelihood significance tests of systemic risk rankings based on marginal expected shortfall in <b>stress</b> <b>scenarios...</b>|$|R

This paper proposes a methodology that uses a macroprudential perspective to assess the resilience of banking systems in member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. It then proceeds to apply this methodology to examine the resilience of the Philippine banking system. Data on financial soundness in the Philippine banking system are utilized in a vector autoregression model to study the dynamic relationships that exist among financial and macroeconomic indicators. Using impulse response functions, a simulation of financial ratios in the banking system is conducted by assuming unlikely but plausible <b>stress</b> <b>scenarios</b> to determine whether banking system credit and capital could withstand the impact of such circumstances. In the <b>stress</b> <b>scenarios,</b> the estimated impact of macroeconomic shocks on nonperforming loan and capital adequacy ratios is generally minimal.
