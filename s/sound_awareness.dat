[...] The ABI has provided therapeutic benefit for NF2 patients in terms of <b>sound</b> <b>awareness,</b> identification of some environmental sounds and improved performance over lipreading alone when communicating face-to-face. However, speech understanding without visual cues (commonly called [...] "open-set" [...] speech recognition) was generally poor.|$|E
50|$|By {{bypassing}} the outer or middle ear, BAHA can increase hearing in noisy situations and help localise sounds. In addition to improved speech understanding, {{it results in}} a natural sound with less distortion and feedback compared with conventional hearing aids. The ear canal is left open for comfort, and helps to reduce any problems caused by chronic ear infections or allergies. In patients with single-sided sensorineural deafness, BAHA sends the sound by the skull bone from the deaf side to the inner ear of the hearing side. This transfer of sound gives a 360° <b>sound</b> <b>awareness.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{rationale}} for devising a post traumatic amnesia scale that adequately measures {{the ability to}} reliably lay down new memories {{is based on the}} “islands of memory” phenomenon, not uncommonly seen in the acute stages of severe traumatic brain injury, and recognised as early as 1932 by W.R. Russell. [...] Russell observed that patients in the acute stage of a brain injury may demonstrate brief periods of sound memory of their surroundings, though such moments of clarity were nevertheless often found to be followed by further periods of confusion and amnesia. [...] Symonds & Russell subsequently warn that it is an error to assume an individual has emerged from PTA based on his or her apparent <b>sound</b> <b>awareness</b> and memory at one particular point of observation; an error which may result in underestimating PTA duration.|$|E

40|$|Predictions from {{theories}} of the processes of word reading acquisition have rarely been tested against evidence from exceptionally early readers. The {{theories of}} Ehri, Share, and Byrne, and an alternative, Knowledge Sources theory, were so tested. The former three theories postulate that full development of context-free letter <b>sounds</b> and <b>awareness</b> of phonemes are required for normal acquisition, while the claim of the alternative is that with or without such, children can use sublexical information from their emerging reading vocabularies to acquire word reading. Results from two independent samples of children aged 3 – 5, and 5 years, with mean word reading levels of 7 and 9 years respectively, showed underdevelopment of their context-free letter <b>sounds</b> and phoneme <b>awareness,</b> relative to their word reading levels and normal comparison samples. Despite such underdevelopment, these exceptional readers engaged in a form of phonological recoding that enabled pseudoword reading, {{at the level of}} older-age normal controls matched on word reading level. Moreover, in the 5 -year-old sample further experiments showed that, relative to normal controls, they had a bias toward use of sublexical information from their reading vocabularies for phonological recoding of heterophonic pseudowords with irregular consistent spelling, and were superior in accessing word meanings independently of phonology, although only if the readers were without exposure to explicit phonics. The three theories were less satisfactory than the alternative theory in accounting for the learning of the exceptionally early readers...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aim: Although {{the ability}} of speech {{perception}} has been improved in implanted subjects with recent progress in technology, cochlear implantation alone is not enough and more aural rehabilitation is necessary. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess improvement of speech perception in children with cochlear implant. Methods: Fourteen cochlear implanted children with a mean age of 5. 5 years participated in this study. Auditory training was performed in 10 to 43 sessions. Speech recognition and perception were evaluated every 3 months. Third evaluation was done only for 4 patients. Results: Mean total score of the first evaluation was 43. 21 %, of the second was 63. 76 %, and of the third evaluation was 78 %. All children obtained complete score for <b>sound</b> <b>awareness</b> at the first evaluation. In environmental sounds discrimination, 71. 3 %, 84. 36 %, and 100 % answered completely to the questions of three evaluations respectively. In speech sounds discrimination, 34. 7 % in the first, 57. 04 % in the second, and 85 % in the third evaluation obtained the complete score, and in auditory memory, complete responses were 21 % for the first, 57. 12 % for the second, and 83 % for third evaluation. In story rephrasing and comprehension, no one answered to questions completely. However, 12. 83 % obtained the complete score in the second and third evaluations. There were statistically significant differences between the first and the second evaluation (p= 0. 002) Conclusion: <b>Sound</b> <b>awareness</b> ability seems to be achieved rapidly. Development of speech and environmental sound discrimination abilities, particularly speech comprehension which is the most important skill, need more impressive training...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{examined}} the impact of phonetic training on English lexical schwa vowel in primary school learners (aged 12) of English as a foreign language in Spain. Students’ perceptual awareness on the occurrence of schwa in unstressed position in English was tested in three groups: i) a group which underwent auditory discrimination and identification practice, ii) a group which underwent listen‐and‐repeat practice, iii) a control group with native exposure. The first two groups could consistently identify full vowels as incorrect in post‐ test. Few differences in perceptual awareness {{as a function of}} position of the unstressed vowel in the word (pre vs. post‐tonic) were found. Word familiarity was found to affect pre‐test performance but to be hindered after treatments.

The results indicated that phonological awareness ability assessed during kindergarten (via the Auditory Analysis Test) {{was a significant predictor of}} word identification and spelling skills 11 years later, when both socioeconomic status and vocabulary development were controlled. In contrast, socioeconomic status, vocabulary development, word recognition, and spelling achievement assessed at kindergarten were not significantly correlated with reading and spelling achievement 11 years later.
