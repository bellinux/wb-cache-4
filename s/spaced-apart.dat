40|$|Some {{changes have}} been {{incorporated}} into a proposed method of manufacturing regular arrays of precisely sized, shaped, positioned, and oriented carbon nanotubes. Such arrays could be useful as mechanical resonators for signal filters and oscillators, and as electrophoretic filters for use in biochemical assays. A prior version of the method was described in Block Copolymers as Templates for Arrays of Carbon Nanotubes, (NPO- 30240), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 27, No. 4 (April 2003), page 56. To recapitulate from that article: As in other previously reported methods, carbon nanotubes would be formed by decomposition of carbon-containing gases over nanometer-sized catalytic metal particles that had been deposited on suitable substrates.

40|$|High {{resolution}} B-mode ultrasound {{images of}} the common carotid artery are obtained with an ultrasound transducer using a standardized methodology. Subjects are supine with the head counter-rotated 45 degrees using a head pillow. The jugular vein and carotid artery are located and positioned in a vertical stacked orientation. The transducer is rotated 90 degrees around the centerline of the transverse image of the stacked structure to obtain a longitudinal image while maintaining the vessels in a stacked position. A computerized methodology assists operators to accurately replicate images obtained over several <b>spaced-apart</b> examinations.

40|$|Many {{conceptual}} {{designs for}} advanced short-takeoff, vertical landing (ASTOVL) aircraft need exhaust nozzles that can vector the jet to provide forces and moments for controlling the aircraft's movement or attitude in flight near the ground. A type of nozzle that can both vector the jet and vary the jet flow area {{is called a}} vane nozzle. Basically, the nozzle consists of parallel, <b>spaced-apart</b> flow passages formed by pairs of vanes (vanesets) that can be rotated on axes perpendicular to the flow. Two important features {{of this type of}} nozzle are the abilities to vector the jet rearward up to 45 degrees and to produce less harsh pressure and velocity footprints during vertical landing than does an equivalent single jet. A one-third-scale model of a generic vane nozzle was tested with unheated air at the NASA Lewis Research Center's Powered Lift Facility. The model had three parallel flow passages. Each passage was formed by a vaneset consisting of a long and a short vane. The longer vanes controlled the jet vector angle, and the shorter controlled the flow area. Nozzle performance for three nominal flow areas (basic and plus or minus 21 percent of basic area), each at nominal jet vector angles from - 20 deg (forward of vertical) to + 45 deg (rearward of vertical) are presented. The tests were made with the nozzle mounted on a model tailpipe with a blind flange on the end to simulate a closed cruise nozzle, at tailpipe-to-ambient pressure ratios from 1. 8 to 4. 0. Also included are jet wake data, single-vaneset vector performance for long/short and equal-length vane designs, and pumping capability. The pumping capability arises from the subambient pressure developed in the cavities between the vanesets, which could be used to aspirate flow from a source such as the engine compartment. Some of the performance characteristics are compared with characteristics of a single-jet nozzle previously reported...|$|E
