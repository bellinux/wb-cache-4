40|$|Abstract: Applications of the {{principle}} <b>of</b> reduction <b>of</b> <b>couplings</b> to the standard model and su-persymmetric grand unied theories are reviewed. Phenomenological applications of renormalization group invariant sum rules for soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters are also discussed. 1. Application to the Standard Model High energy physicists have been using renor-malizability as the predictive tool, and also {{to decide whether or}} not a quantity is calculable. It is possible, using the method <b>of</b> reduction <b>of</b> <b>couplings</b> [1]{[4],[5], to renormalize a theory with fewer number of counter terms then usually coun-ted, implying that the traditional notion of renor-malizability should be generalized in a certain sense. Consequently, the notion of the predictabil-ity and the calculability [6] may also be general-ized with the help <b>of</b> reduction <b>of</b> <b>couplings.</b> <b>Of</b> course, whether the generalizations of these no-tions have anything to do with nature is another question. The question can be answered if one applies the idea <b>of</b> reduction <b>of</b> <b>couplings</b> to re-alistic models, make predictions that are specc for reduction <b>of</b> <b>couplings,</b> and then wait till ex-perimentalists nd positive results. In ref. [8] the idea <b>of</b> reduction <b>of</b> <b>couplings</b> has been applied to the SU(3) CSU(2) LU(1) Y gauge model for the strong and electroweak in-teractions. As it is known, this theory has a lot of free parameters, and at rst sight it seemed there exists no guiding principle how to reduce the couplings in this theory. There were two main problems associated with this program. The one This work was done in collaboration wit...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the online competitiveness for scheduling a single resource non-preemptively {{in order to}} maximize its utilization. The <b>slack</b> <b>of</b> a job is equal to the gap between its release time and the last possible time at which it may be started while still meeting its deadline. When no restrictions are placed on either the length or <b>slack</b> <b>of</b> any job, previous lower bounds show that no algorithm, deterministic or randomized, can guarantee any constant bound on the competitiveness of a resulting schedule. We examine a natural restriction in which each job must o#er slack at least proportional to the job's processing time. Specifically, we will say that a problem instance has patience #, if any job of length #J# has a <b>slack</b> <b>of</b> at least # #J#. We show that for any # > 0 a simple greedy algorithm is (2 + 1 #) - competitive even when arbitrary job lengths are allowed. We give lower bounds showing that this is the best possible result for a deterministic algorithm even if all jobs have [...] ...|$|R

We compare our results with the updated bounds on the B_s-B̅_s mass difference reported by CDF collaborations, and present new constraints on the relevant combinations of parameters of the minimal supersymmetric standard model with R-parity violation. Our results show that upper bound on the relevant combination <b>of</b> <b>couplings</b> <b>of</b> B_s-B̅_s mixing is of the order 10 ^- 9. We also calculate the B^ 0 _d-B̅^ 0 _d and K^ 0 -K̅^ 0 mass differences, and show that the upper bounds on the relevant combinations <b>of</b> <b>couplings</b> are two and four orders of magnitude stronger than ones reported in the literatures, respectively.
