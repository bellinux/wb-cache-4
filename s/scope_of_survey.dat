40|$|Check shot seismic {{velocity}} {{surveys were}} collected in 100 B/C, 200 East, 200 -PO- 1 Operational Unit (OU), and the Gable Gap areas {{in order to provide}} time-depth correlation information to aid the interpretation of existing seismic reflection data acquired at the Hanford Site (Figure 1). This report details results from 5 wells surveyed in fiscal year (FY) 2008, 7 wells in FY 2009, and 17 wells in FY 2010 and provides summary compressional-wave seismic velocity information to help guide future seismic survey design as well as improve current interpretations of the seismic data (SSC 1979 / 1980; SGW- 39675; SGW- 43746). Augmenting the check shot database are four surveys acquired in 2007 in support of the Bechtel National, Inc. Waste Treatment Plant construction design (PNNL- 16559, PNNL- 16652), and check shot surveys in three wells to support seismic testing in the 200 West Area (Waddell et al., 1999). Additional sonic logging was conducted during the late 1970 s and early 1980 s as part of the Basalt Waste Isolation Program (BWIP) (SSC 1979 / 1980) and check shot/sonic surveys as part of the safety report for the Skagit/Hanford Nuclear project (RDH/ 10 -AMCP- 0164). Check shot surveys are used to obtain an in situ measure of compressional-wave seismic velocity for sediment and rock {{in the vicinity of the}} well point, and provide the seismic-wave travel time to geologic horizons of interest. The check shot method deploys a downhole seismic receiver (geophone) to record the arrival of seismic waves generated by a source at the ground surface. The travel time of the first arriving seismic-wave is determined and used to create a time-depth function to correlate encountered geologic intervals with the seismic data. This critical tie with the underlying geology improves the interpretation of seismic reflection profile information. Fieldwork for this investigation was conducted by in house staff during the weeks of September 22, 2008 for 5 wells in the 200 East Area (Figure 2); June 1, 2009 for 7 wells in the 200 -PO- 1 OU and Gable Gap regions (see Figure 3 and Figure 4); and March 22, 2010 and April 19, 2010 for 17 wells in the 200 East, The initial <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>survey</b> work was planned for Wells 299 -EI 8 - 1, 699 - 2 -E 14, 699 - 12 - 18, 699 - 16 - 51, 699 - 42 - 30, 699 - 53 - 55 B, 699 - 54 - 18 D, and 699 - 84 - 34 B. Well 299 -E 18 - 1 could not be entered due to bent casing (prevented removal of the pump), wells 699 - 12 - 18 and 699 - 42 - 30 could not be safely reached by the logging truck, Well 699 - 16 - 51 was decommissioned prior to survey start, Well 699 - 53 - 55 B did not have its pump pulled, and Wells 699 - 2 -EI 4, 699 - 54 - 18 D, and 699 - 84 - 34 B are artesian and capped with an igloo structure.
