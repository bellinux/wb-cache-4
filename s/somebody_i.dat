Sarria maintained his innocence, stating that the arresting officer knew him personally. [...] "But {{they had to make}} an example of <b>somebody...</b> <b>I</b> was {{in the wrong place at}} the wrong time." [...] Nonetheless, he was convicted and subjected to a large fine. Sarria, understanding that his conviction meant he could never become certified as a teacher, dropped out of college. Unsure of how to find work, he took the advice of a drag performer named Michelle and entered a drag contest at an Oakland bar called Pearl's. Sarria took second place, winning a two-week performance contract at the bar at $50 a week. [...] "I decided then to be the most notorious impersonator or homosexual or fairy or whatever you wanted to call me–and you would pay me for it." [...] Returning to San Francisco, he picked up some small singing jobs while still cocktail waiting at the Black Cat.|$|E
500|$|Some things {{explored}} in the album were Radke's personal experiences, which include his mother, {{the corruption of}} Las Vegas, and his incarceration in prison due to multiple run-ins with the law involving narcotics and battery charges related {{to the death of}} Michael Cook. Radke stated that he chose not to write any songs about love because, [...] "...I'm not going to lie ... and try to write songs on how much I love <b>somebody.</b> <b>I</b> do have love, but {{there will be a lot}} of songs about just what I’ve been through." [...] Several songs focused on his departure from Escape the Fate after they kicked him out and replaced him with former Blessthefall singer Craig Mabbitt, with songs on the album that directly attacked both Mabbitt and Escape the Fate bassist Max Green. Prior to the album's release, Radke discussed what he intended to say about Escape the Fate on certain tracks, stating in an interview that he believed that the band's first album without Radke, This War Is Ours, was named after the conflict over Mabbitt taking over Radke's position in Escape the Fate. The band has since claimed it was not written about Radke, but he did not believe them.|$|E

[...] She was {{fingerprinted}} and charged with felonious assault and possession of a deadly weapon. The next morning, the New York Daily News ran a front page headline stating: [...] "Actress Shoots Andy Warhol." [...] Solanas demanded a retraction of the statement {{that she was an}} actress. The Daily News changed the headline in its later edition and added a quote from Solanas stating [...] "I'm a writer, not an actress." [...] At her arraignment in Manhattan Criminal Court she denied shooting Warhol because he wouldn't produce her play but said [...] "it was for the opposite reason", that [...] "he has a legal claim on my works." [...] Solanas told the judge that [...] "it's not often that I shoot <b>somebody.</b> <b>I</b> didn't do it for nothing. Warhol had tied me up, lock, stock, and barrel. He was going to do something to me which would have ruined me." [...] She told the judge she wanted to represent herself and she declared that she [...] "was right in what I did! I have nothing to regret!" [...] "The judge struck her comments from the court record" [...] and had her admitted to Bellevue Hospital for psychiatric observation.|$|E

Dammeier likened the department's actions to going to the post office to get letters sent to Quon instead of his house. Scalia pointed out that Quon could have obtained hard copies of the messages and circulated them himself. [...] "hen I get a piece of mail from <b>somebody,</b> <b>I</b> could do that as well", the lawyer replied, [...] "but that doesn't mean that the government gets to go to the post office and get my mail before I get it".

2500|$|Brady played college {{football}} for the University of Michigan from 1995 to 1999. He was a backup quarterback {{for his first}} two years, while teammate and future NFL quarterback Brian Griese led the 1997 Wolverines to an undefeated season, which was capped by {{a victory in the}} Rose Bowl and a share of the national championship. When he enrolled at Michigan, Brady was seventh on the depth chart, and he had an intense struggle to get some playing time. At one point, Brady hired a sports psychologist to help him cope with frustration and anxiety, and even considered transferring to California. He worked closely with assistant athletic director Greg Harden, who met with Brady every week to build his confidence and to maximize his performance on the field. Brady told 60 Minutes in 2014: [...] "He will always be <b>somebody</b> <b>I</b> rely on for sound advice and mentorship. He has helped me with my own personal struggles in both athletics and in life. Greg really pushed me in a direction that I wasn't sure I could go." ...|$|E

2500|$|In October 1979, a knife-wielding assailant {{attacked}} and cut Bell several times {{while he was}} off-duty in the cathedral's chancery, which was then located two blocks north of the state capitol. He was stabbed twice before his secretary, Jean Tamaki, found William Luthin attacking the bishop with a [...] "dagger-like" [...] knife. Tamaki was able to pull Luthin away by his shirt because the attacker was of [...] "medium or small build." [...] Bell {{had been in his}} office preparing for a trip to see Pope John Paul II in Chicago, Illinois. Luthin surrendered himself at a hospital and was found {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity. Police arrested Luthin as a suspect because he told nurses, [...] "Call <b>somebody.</b> <b>I</b> stabbed a priest." [...] A knife was found on the office couch together with the sales receipt from a nearby store. Bell was held overnight at Mercy General Hospital with hand and rib wounds. Luthin had seen the bishop earlier that day and reportedly complained about being excommunicated. The bishop's trip to meet the pope was canceled.|$|E
2500|$|Tureaud next {{worked as}} a bouncer. It was {{at this time that}} he created the persona of Mr. T. His wearing of gold neck chains and other jewelry was the result of {{customers}} losing the items or leaving them behind at the night club after a fight. A banned customer, or one reluctant to risk a confrontation by going back inside, could return to claim his property from Mr. T wearing it conspicuously right out front. Along with controlling the violence as a doorman, Tureaud was mainly hired to keep out drug dealers and users. During his bouncing days, Tureaud was in over 200 fights and was sued a number of times, but won each case. [...] "I have {{been in and out of}} the courts as a result of my beating up <b>somebody.</b> <b>I</b> have been sued by customers whom I threw out that claimed that I viciously attacked them without just cause and/or I caused them great bodily harm as a result of a beating I supposedly gave them," [...] Mr. T once remarked.|$|E

Billy Taylor led the offense with 172 rushing yards, including touchdown runs of 43 and 66 yards, on 11 carries, an average of 15.6 yards per carry. Michigan rushed {{for a total of}} 452 yard, with addition touchdowns scored by third-string fullback Bob Thornbladh (2), quarterback Tom Slade (2), and Alan Walker. Thom Darden returned an interception 60 yards for a touchdown, and Michigan also scored on a safety when the Indiana returner took the ball at the one-yard line, took a step back, and downed the ball in the end zone. [...] Michigan also recovered four fumbles and played its reserves extensively, with a total of 68 players seeing game action. Dana Coin added a field goal and five extra points. After the game, coach Bo Schembechler sent his regrets to his close friend and Indiana coach John Pont; Schembechler told the press, [...] "I hate to beat anybody that bad, especially <b>somebody</b> <b>I</b> like." ...|$|E
