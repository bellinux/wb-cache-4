40|$|International audienceThe {{decline of}} bees {{is a major}} concern due to their vital role in pollinating many crops and wild plants. Some regions in South America, and {{especially}} the Pampas, are amongst those parts of the world where stressors of bee populations have been little studied. The Pampas has been intensively transformed for agriculture, being presently one of the most productive areas of agricultural commodities in the world. Here, we aim to provide first insights on the taxonomic and functional composition of bee assemblages in the Rolling Pampa, the most intensively managed part of the Pampas. Soybean (herbicide-tolerant genetically modified varieties) is the predominant crop in this region. Bees were sampled with coloured pan traps. Sampling points were located on field margins in either the cropped or the semi-natural grassland area of a farmland site devoted to annual cropping. A total of 2384 individuals were caught, representing 33 taxa [mainly (morpho) species]. The subgenus Lasioglossum (Dialictus) largely dominated captures (78 % of the total abundance) and was relatively abundant in the entire study area, suggesting that some species are likely to reach their ecological requirements in cropped areas. No-till fields and field margins may provide large areas for these below-ground nesting species, while their polylectic food preferences allow them to collect pollen {{on a wide range of}} plant species, among them possibly soybean. On the contrary, the richness and the abundance of other taxa were higher in the <b>semi-natural</b> <b>area</b> than in the cropped area. Among them, above-ground nesting or oil-collecting species, which have more specialised nesting and floral requirements, were highly associated with the <b>semi-natural</b> <b>area.</b> Our findings highlight the large dominance of L. (Dialictus) species in this highly intensively managed landscape, and the urgent need of preserving semi-natural habitats to maintain species-rich and functionally diverse bee communities in the Pampa...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFunctional {{diversity}} (FD) {{is increasingly}} {{used as a}} metric to evaluate the impact of forest management strategies on ecosystem functioning. Management interventions that aim to maximise FD require knowledge of multiple environmental drivers of FD, which have not been studied to date in temperate coniferous production forests. We quantified {{the relative importance of}} abiotic (forest management) and biotic (ground vegetation community) drivers of carabid FD and trait distribution in 44 coniferous plantation forest stands across the UK. Carabid FD declined with canopy cover and carabid body length correlated negatively with the percentage of open <b>semi-natural</b> <b>area</b> surrounding a plot. We conclude that forest management could enhance carabid FD through initiatives that emulate natural disturbance regimes through gap creation. We found that neither functional nor taxonomic metrics of vegetation diversity correlated with carabid FD, suggesting that restoration of plant communities, a major goal of forest restoration efforts, will not necessarily enhance carabid FD in coniferous plantations...|$|E
40|$|Predation is a {{major cause}} of {{breeding}} failure in bird species with open nests. Although many studies have investigated nest predation rates, direct identification of nest predators is sporadic, especially in (semi-) natural habitats. We quantified nest success and identified nest predators in a population of Skylarks Alauda arvensis and Woodlarks Lullula arborea breeding in a protected <b>semi-natural</b> <b>area</b> dominated by heathland and different succession states of grassland on nutrient-poor soil in The Netherlands. We monitored 54 nests by means of continuous video surveillance to determine survival times and predators, and monitored another 44 nests without a camera. Fates of the 58 (40) Skylark (Woodlark) nests were: fledging 41 (27), depredation 13 (12), egg desertion 1 (0) and nestling death 3 (1). The overall nest success of all monitored nests (58 (40), Mayfield estimate) was 33 % (22 %; all mortality factors considered) or 43 % (25 %; only depredation). Predators of Skylark nests were Red Fox Vulpes vulpes (5), Carrion Crow Corvus corone (1) and European Adder Vipera berus (1). Woodlark nests were depredated by Carrion Crow (2), Eurasian Jay Garrulus glandadus (1) and Red Fox (1). Results suggest that the main nest predators might differ between the two co-occurring lark species; Skylark nests located in more open sites were preyed upon mainly by Red Fox, while the main predators of Woodlark nests, located generally closer to trees, are corvids...|$|E

40|$|The Mediterranean basin {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} biodiversity hotspots. However, only 5 % of its original vegetation is still in place, and the landscape has been managed and transformed by humans for at least the last two millennia. In the last century the mechanization of agriculture and the over-use of semi-natural habitats have influenced the region even more than before, with huge consequences, especially on islands. Sardinia is the second largest island in the Mediterranean basin, and it has been considered for long as a <b>semi-natural</b> <b>area</b> with an economy based on traditional agroforestry and pastoral practices. Considering four maps covering Sardinia and ranging from 1935 to 2007, we measured the rate of forest changes demonstrating a constant trend towards forest increase, and with a complete recovery of the total forest surface compared to the late 1800 s. The traditional agroforestry practices decrease in time due to socio-economic reasons, with deeper consequences for the mosaic of traditional agricultural areas and semi-natural habitats, as well as for the conservation of the unique biodiversity of Sardinia. Species typically linked to Mediterranean forests recovered and are recovering, while species linked to traditional semi-natural landscapes decreased, facing conservation problems. We suggest that the current challenges for biodiversity conservation in the island should be focused together with the agricultural policies towards the preservation and improvement of traditional open areas, even important in the history of the entire Mediterranean hotspot. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|The {{intensification}} of crop management {{have led to}} an impoverishment of the biological diversity, resulting {{in the loss of}} ecosystem services. In viticulture, flora could play an interesting role because it can compensate the negative impacts of vine monoculture. The flora biodiversity favours fauna biodiversity, sustaining especially the presence of pollinating insects in the grapevine inter row sown with grass or legumes and area around grapevine plots. These aspects have been poorly studied until now. A grapevine experiment set in Alsace at INRA Colmar in the frame of the DEPHY-EXPE PEPSVI project was used to address these questions. Between 2014 and 2016, floristic survey was carried out on 4 sites, within an area of 500 [*]m 2 within each plot. On those sites, different grapevine systems based on integrated, biological, or biodynamic production were tested. The “presence/absence” method implemented to characterize flora composition and richness on the grapevine row, the inter-row sown with grass, and the tilled inter-row. Results showed that Asteraceae, Fabaceae and Poaceae were the most represented flora families. Asteraceae and Fabaceae may provide pollination ecosystem services if they are well managed and allowed to flower. Moreover, Fabaceae family increases soil fertility by symbiotic fixation. The role of environmental factors, i. e., <b>semi-natural</b> <b>area</b> like hedge or forest edge close to vineyard, and anthropic factors, i. e., soil cover management, were also characterized and shown as impacted on flora composition and richness under grapevine rows and between inter- rows. Flora characterization will continue in 2017 and 2018 to validate the present results and to assess the evolution of flora composition and richness in different climatic conditions...|$|E
40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted with}} outplantings of the native perennial shrub Senna mexicana var. chapmanii in a <b>semi-natural</b> <b>area</b> adjacent to native pine rockland habitat in southern Florida. The presence of ants {{and the availability of}} extrafloral nectar were manipulated in a stratified random design. Insect communities were monitored and recorded over a period of six months with a view to addressing three main questions. Do ants provide biotic defense against key herbivores on S. chapmanii? Is the presence of ants on S. chapmanii mediated by EFN? Finally, are there ecological costs associated with the presence of ants on S. chapmanii, such as a reduction in alternative predator or parasitoid numbers? Herbivores on S. chapmanii included immature stages of three pierid butterflies, and adult weevils. Eight species of ants were associated with the plants, and other predators included spiders, ladybugs, wasps, and hemipterans. Parasitic, haemolymph-sucking midges (Ceratopogonidae) and parasitoid flies were also associated with the caterpillar herbivores, and possibly the extrafloral nectaries of the plants. The presence of ants did not appear to influence oviposition by butterflies, as numbers of lepidopterans of all developmental stages did not differ among treatments. Significantly more late instar caterpillars, however, were observed on plants with ants excluded, indicating that ants remove small caterpillars from plants. Substantially more alternative predators (spiders, ladybugs, and wasps) were observed on plants with ants excluded. Rates of parasitization did not differ among the treatments, but there were substantially fewer caterpillars succumbing to virus among those collected from control plants. We provide a rare look at facultative ant-plant mutualisms {{in the context of the}} many other interactions with which they overlap. We conclude that ants provide some biotic defense against herbivores on S. chapmanii, and plants benefit overall from the presence of ants, despite negative impacts on non-ant predators...|$|E

40|$|Roadside verges in densely {{populated}} areas {{are often a}} significant addition to the total <b>semi-natural</b> <b>area</b> and as such {{may contribute to the}} conservation of biodiversity. Furthermore, they can enhance the ecological cohesion of a region, especially when the existing nature reserves are small and/or highly fragmented. We investigated the occurrence of ground beetles and spiders in six highway verges with grey hair-grass vegetation in the Veluwe region, The Netherlands. Total species number in the verges was similar to the values found in nearby nature reserves with comparable vegetation, but the ground beetles tended to be more abundant in the reserves. Many stenotopic species were present in the verges, confirming the significant conservation value of this habitat. However, compared with the nature reserves, there were fewer species of stenotopic ground beetles and the stenotopic spiders were less abundant in the verges. From our knowledge of the biology and ecology of the species captured it seems likely that this is attributable to differences in "habitat quality". In the verges, species preferring bare sand are scarcer, and the weighted mean body length of ground beetles is shorter than in nature reserves. This suggests that the sward in the road verges is too dense and the suitable vegetation too patchy to sustain some of the stenotopic species. Habitat analyses support this contention: Compared with the nature reserves, the verges had proportionally less bare sand, more herb and tree cover and the vegetation patches were smaller. The strategy suggested to promote stenotopic species entails removing encroaching trees and shrubs from the verges in order to expand the nutrient-poor zone and (re-) create pioneer conditions. Subsequent management should aim at further improving the road verges as extensions of nutrient-poor habitat...|$|E

The area of study {{is located in the}} municipal territory of Piacenza (Emilia-Romagna, Italy) along the eastern shores of the river Trebbia and is made up of the closed landfill of Solid Urban Waste of Borgotrebbia (active from 1972 to 1985) and of the neighbouring areas (in North-South order: riverside area, northern borders of the landfill, landfill disposal, southern borders and cultivated corn fields). For each area pedological and vegetational analyses were carried out and in particular, as regards the soil, various chemical-physical analyses were done among which: pH, organic carbon, total nitrogen, salinity, exchangeable bases and granulometry. The ground vegetation data were collected using phytosociological relevés according to the method of the Zurich-Montpellier Sigmatist School, (Braun-Blanquet, 1964). For the analysis of the environmental quality of each area, the floristic-vegetation indexes system was applied as proposed by Taffetani & Rismondo (2009) (updated by Rismondo et al., 2011) conveniently created for analysing the ecological functionality of the agro-ecosystems. The results obtained by such applications drew attention to a dynamic vegetation mass in the landfill which, despite a value of the floristic biodiversity index (IFB) comparable to that of the borders, shows a much lower value of the maturity index (IM). This is due to the elevated percentage of annual species (index of the therophytic component = 52. 78 %) belonging to the phytosociological class Stellarietea mediae Tüxen, Lohmeyer & Preising ex von Rochow 1951. From a first comparison of the information obtained from the vegetation and soil analyses, {{it would appear that the}} areas with a lower environmental quality are those in which there is (or was) a greater human disturbance...|$|E
40|$|Enclaves {{of natural}} {{vegetation}} in suburbia have an importance far beyond their area. The sprawling cities of materialistic Australia {{are in fact}} surprisingly well endowed with the lost values of rural beauty and natural scene. Sydney has its large national parks which provide an impediment to northern and southern suburban expansion {{as well as a}} large number of reserves in at least a near natural state around the margins of its magnificent harbours. Melbourne has Studley Park, a <b>semi-natural</b> <b>area</b> in a river setting {{within walking distance of the}} CBD, as well as a considerable extent of coast in a more or less natural condition. Adelaide has its pastoral parks which ring the CBD. Brisbane has the Mount Coot-tha Reserve. Perth is fortunate to have King's Park and Hobart its Domain and numerous other reserves, all in a close to natural state. Despite a rapidly growing and vocal conservation movement, which is largely centred on the cities, almost all of these natural and semi-natural reserves are suffering from a steady encroachment of other uses. They are regarded as the best sites for freeways and planned recreational expansion, and are even occasionally suffering commercial encroachment. Their natural qualities are also being steadily destroyed in a more subtle manner consequent upon the intensive land use that is found on their margins. Some of the symptoms and probable causes of such subtle change have been described in an earlier article in this journal (Kirkpatrick, 1974) in relation to the Sandringham Foreshore Reserve in Melbourne. This article completes the consideration of the reserve, in discussing the changes that have occurred in the vegetation with the suburbanization of its hinterland, the vegetation in 1971, and the problems of conserving the vegetation of the reserve in the future. In this paper the term 'native' is used to denote that a species to the best of my knowledge would have occurred in the Sandringham area before white settlement. The terms 'alien', 'introduced' and 'exotic' denote that a species has been introduced into the area since white settlement. A more detailed indication of the origin of all species mentioned in this article can be found in Kirkpatrick (1974) along with authorities for the nomenclature used. The word 'natural' is used to imply that vegetation is similar to that which would have probably been found in the area before white settlement. Thus, the most natural area of vegetation in the reserve would be composed of native species, have a structure that could be found in similar environments less intensively used by man, and would not owe its genesis to actions of European man. Similarly the word 'disturbance' is used purely in relation to the actions of European man. Normal environmental events and processes may lead to the creation of habitats suitable for the establishment of exotics, but are excluded from the definition of disturbance for the purposes of this article...|$|E

The paper presents a method to classify semi –natural alpine areas by combining the spatial detail of orthophotos with the spectral information of SPOT satellite images. As case study, an alpine region in South Tyrol (Italy) has been considered. A four step approach is applied: (1) object delimitation, (2) object information assignment, (3) data mining and (4) classification. First, a segmentation procedure on orthophotos is used for an accurate delimitation of spatial objects, namely the segment. In a second step, spectral information from SPOT data as well as textural information from orthophotos are assigned to the segments.

An Airborne Thematic Mapper (ATM) image with 1. 25 m spatial resolution {{was used as a}} source of training data. The ATM image was spatially degraded to 10 m resolution to form the remotely sensed input and the study area was subdivided into land parcels by manual digitizing. The per-parcel approach extracted raster data from a core area described by a shrunken version of a land parcel, thus eliminating mixed boundary pixels. Boundary pixels were shown to be more variable than the core pixels and their removal improved classification confidence. The per-parcel approach calculated the mean spectral response of the extracted core pixels. This was shown to remove within-parcel variation and improve classification confidence in comparison to per-pixel class allocations. A parcel-based representation was shown to be most appropriate for mapping agricultural land cover in comparison to <b>semi-natural</b> <b>areas,</b> because agricultural landscapes have an inherent parcel structure. When land cover is heterogeneous, as in many <b>semi-natural</b> <b>areas,</b> a per-pixel classification would appear to be more appropriate.
