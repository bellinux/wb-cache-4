5|$|Cryptothecia rubrocincta {{is easily}} {{recognized}} by the bright red pigment in the thallus. The pigment, first isolated from the species by Hesse in 1904, is called chiodectonic acid. The lichen also contains the colorless depside compound confluentinic acid. A 2005 study employed the technique Raman spectroscopy to determine the chemical composition of the differently colored zones. The white crystalline zone contains calcium oxalate dihydrate, or weddellite, a chemical substance found in other lichens and extremophiles growing on calcium-rich surfaces. Some {{have suggested that the}} calcium oxalate serves in the organism's survival strategy: the <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> as a crystalline hydrate is essential for periods of drought in desiccated environments, and calcium oxalate has been identified as dissuading herbivores. Because the lichen grows on calcium-poor surfaces, calcium ions are thought to be acquired from rain, bird droppings, and airborne particles.|$|E

500|$|Potential {{evapotranspiration}} supplements {{the measurement}} of precipitation in providing a scientific measurement-based definition of a desert. The water budget of an area can be calculated using the formula P − PE ± S, wherein P is precipitation, PE is potential evapotranspiration rates and S is amount of surface <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> Evapotranspiration is the combination of water loss through atmospheric evaporation and through the life processes of plants. Potential evapotranspiration, then, {{is the amount of}} water that could evaporate in any given region. As an example, Tucson, Arizona receives about [...] of rain per year, however about [...] of water could evaporate {{over the course of a}} year. In other words, about eight times more water could evaporate from the region than actually falls as rain. Rates of evapotranspiration in cold regions such as Alaska are much lower because of the lack of heat to aid in the evaporation process.|$|E

2500|$|A dam is {{a barrier}} that stops or restricts {{the flow of water}} or {{underground}} streams. Reservoirs created by dams not only suppress floods but also provide water for activities such [...] as irrigation, human consumption, industrial use, aquaculture, and navigability. Hydropower is often used in conjunction with dams to generate electricity. A dam {{can also be used to}} collect water or for <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> which can be evenly distributed between locations. Dams generally serve the primary purpose of retaining water, while other structures such as floodgates or levees (also known as dikes) are used to manage or prevent water flow into specific land regions.|$|E
2500|$|Ponds and Lakes are {{artificial}} {{bodies of}} open water {{that are usually}} created by constructing a dam wall with a weir outlet structure. Similar to constructed wetlands, {{they can be used}} to treat runoff by providing extended detention and allowing sedimentation, absorption of nutrients and UV disinfection to occur. In addition, they provide an aesthetic quality for recreation, wildlife habitat, and valuable <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> that can potentially be reused for e.g. irrigation. Often, artificial ponds and lakes also form part of a flood detention system. Aquatic vegetation plays an important role for the water quality in artificial lakes and ponds in respect of maintaining and regulating the oxygen and nutrient levels. [...] Due to a water depth greater than 1.5m, emergent macrophytes are usually restricted to the margins but submergent plants may occur in the open water zone. Fringing vegetation can be useful in reducing bank erosion. Ponds are normally not used as stand-alone WSUD measure but are often combined with sediment basins or constructed wetlands as pretreatments.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{era when}} {{municipal}} water supply systems {{had not yet been}} established, Monier realised that his containers could be used for the collection and <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> for gardens. He continued his education with courses in horticulture and landscape gardening. In 1849, without quitting his post at the Tuileries, he opened a small workshop, and began to take on landscaping projects. These took him as far afield as Strasburg. The fashion at the time was to decorate large gardens with rockeries and grottoes and to form these from plain concrete. For further economy, formed hollow artificial boulders from his ferro-cement (French: [...] "ciment et fer"). He also created small garden pavilions, shaping and carving the concrete surface to imitate the rustic wooden originals. In July 1867 he exhibited his ideas at the second Paris International Exhibition (Exposition universelle). In the same month he applied for his first patent for containers, which was granted as No. 77165. Soon after he applied for an addition covering pipes, and yet another for ornamental pools. His projects included a 20 cubic metre reservoir and a terrace roof. By 1869 his establishment included offices, workshops, and greenhouses, plus stables for eight draught horses and three carriage horses. In September of that year he applied for a patent for panels suitable for cladding buildings, and for use as pavers and tiles.|$|E
