50|$|Strapping machines, {{also known}} as bundlers, are used for higher volume {{applications}} or special applications. They are available in horizontal and vertical orientations, however the vertical orientation is far more common. They are also available in bottom seal, side seal, and top seal orientations, which define where the joint {{is located on the}} bundle. They are available in semi-automatic and automatic varieties. The automatic versions can additionally to be used inline with conveyor systems. A photocell is used to detect when the bundle is in the correct location, stop the conveyors, and activate the <b>strapping</b> <b>machine.</b> Most however will be found in standalone applications.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two major}} types of {{equipment}} available for strapping: hand tools and strapping machines. A dispenser is used with both types of equipment to dispense the strap. Some strapping machines have the dispenser built-in, others (typically those on large arch machines) have a separate powered dispenser, which can automatically load or thread new coils. Non-powered separated dispensers have a pulley which releases and activates a brake to stop the inertia of the coil to keep the strap from over-running onto the floor. Typically dispensers used on large arch strapping machines have multiple pulleys {{to act as a}} way to store strap in a way that can be quickly dispensed. Smaller arch machines such as table top machines will feed strap into a pool box/accumulator instead. In both cases this is required otherwise the <b>strapping</b> <b>machine</b> will draw the strap faster than the dispenser can pay off.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The <b>strapping</b> <b>machine</b> for Paper Bills {{typically}} {{was designed}} to reduce labor intensity and enhance production automation level. The machine’s structure and working principle were described. There are three work posts in this equipment, they work continuously. This approach makes it very easy to split up a complex transformation {{into a series of}} simple transformations arranged in a loop line. The machine includes currency count/counterfeit distinguishing system, conveying system and strapping system. In the same time, the machine control system that adopts the PLC programmable controller can simplify the control system, and its reliability strengthens further. Practices show that the <b>strapping</b> <b>machine</b> has the advantages of simple structure, high efficiency, low cost and small vibrating noise...|$|E

50|$|Checkered Grip. The {{front and}} back grip <b>straps</b> were <b>machine</b> {{checkered}} (25 per inch), whereas the 92FS was vertically serrated. The grip frame was flared slightly at the base to enhance pointability and control.|$|R
50|$|The joint is {{the weakest}} {{part of the}} system, {{therefore}} the type of joining method used is very important if strength is an issue. The strength of a joint {{is defined as the}} force required to break the strap in uniaxial tension. This is then compared to the uniaxial strength of the strap and recorded as the percent difference (e.g., a sample of steel strap may have a 5000 lb break strength and the seal may fail at 3000 lb, so the seal is said to have a 60% strength). Hot knife welds have a minimum break strength of 55%. Friction welds have a minimum break strength of 65%. Well set up <b>strapping</b> <b>machines</b> or friction weld tools will aim for around 80% of break strength. Metal clips/seals are surprisingly low with circa 100 - 120 kg slip resistance.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduced}} the design requirements, structure, {{as well as}} the working principle of vermicelli <b>strapping</b> <b>machine.</b> The process of strapping mainly divided into two steps. The first step is to make the cotton thread wrapped around the vermicelli, during which, the speed of wrapping is greatly improved because the distance of the winding is shorten by the innovative teardrop-shaped winding track. The second step is to knot the cotton thread that wrapped the vermicelli. The type of knot used in this <b>strapping</b> <b>machine</b> can be implemented on machine; besides, the knot is so tight that it’s not easy to be loosed. By adjusting the position of knotting structure, the gap of bundled vermicelli is reduced. As a result, the vermicelli will be strapped tight...|$|E
40|$|Published by Wiley for the Society of Plastics Engineers (SPE). Polypropylene {{strapping}} tape, {{produced with}} different draw ratios {{and types of}} surface embossing, was welded with a standard semi-automatic <b>strapping</b> <b>machine.</b> The effect of the welding temperature, surface profile of the sealing tool and the tape properties (draw ratio and embossing pattern) on the microstructure and the joint strength was studied. A near optimal temperature range was identified. The draw ratio of the tape was found to influence the weld efficiency...|$|E

50|$|The {{story begins}} with Nick Fury {{and a female}} agent talking about his car needing a new tyre. The page gets cut and a new figure is introduced, {{a man in a}} strange get up who {{explains}} who Nick Fury is and it is revealed that the scene is just a training exercise with a young spy named Chris Kong who is <b>strapped</b> in <b>machine</b> which makes him experience moments out of Fury's life in an attempt to mimick him perfectly so that he can replace infiltrate S.H.I.E.L.D. and replace Fury. It is also revealed that the man is in the company of some alien like creatures. The man tells Kong that it is not enough that he is a master of disguise but that he must truly become like Fury, think, act and feel like him since S.H.I.E.L.D. has telepaths superior to those they work with. The man also reveals that Kong has failed every mission so far in rather embarrassing ways, he lost at the roulette table, accidentally killed a cat instead of its megalomaniac owner and failed the most recent one which they just attempted.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Happiness in Slavery", {{directed}} by Jon Reiss, {{was inspired by}} the 1899 novel The Torture Garden by French author Octave Mirbeau. It features performance artist Bob Flanagan entering a large room, placing a flower and a candle on an altar and in a ritualistic style prepares for something; by washing himself before becoming <b>strapped</b> into a <b>machine</b> with long robotic claws that arise from the machine and subsequently tear apart his skin and impale his hands. The man reacts in pleasure as this occurs. There are also drills that drill into his skin in various places letting his blood drip onto the floor beneath, where there is a garden apparently being fertilized by human blood.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{examines}} {{attempts to}} 'correct' or 'straighten' the body - implicitly perceived as imperfect - as represented in 'documentary' fictions by three key nineteenth-century French authors: Gustave Flaubert, Guy de Maupassant and Emile Zola. Along with their contemporary 'source' texts, two episodes from Flaubert are discussed: {{attempts by the}} eponymous heroes of Bouvard et Pecuchet to perform exercises prescribed by a contemporary gymnastics manual, and Charles Bovary's vain attempt in Madame Bovary to perform corrective surgery on a club foot, informed by a contemporary medical treatise. Maupassant's novel Mont-Oriol is discussed in relation to what was known in late-nineteenth-century Paris as 'Swedish gymnastics', in which patients were <b>strapped</b> into <b>machines</b> in order to simulate vigorous physical activities such as horse-riding and swimming. Finally, attempts to 'correct the body', 'redresser le corps' {{in the words of}} the French historian of the body Georges Vigarello, by means of hypodermic injections, are discussed in relation to Zola's novel Le Docteur Pascal, and a medical treatise on this kind of treatment on which Zola drew. The chapter concludes by arguing that the representation of these kinds of treatments is connected to the question of knowledge, and how it should be organised. Works by authors such as Flaubert and Zola in particular are in fact engaging with attempts in the broader culture to organise, to 'redresser' the body of savoir...|$|R
5000|$|Leela {{seems to}} survive The Time War and {{features}} in a trilogy of Companion Chronicles audio stories {{in which she}} is now dying, aging a year per day as {{the powers of the}} Time Lords no longer keep her from death. Starting with The Catalyst, which is primarily a flashback to an adventure before Horror of Fang Rock, elderly Leela is being interrogated by a Z'Nai warrior (a race encountered by the Third Doctor). How Leela ends up in their custody is unknown, but they question her to learn what secrets she may know of a legendary [...] "lost world" [...] (presumed to be Gallifrey). It is almost certain that her sight has returned, as she can describe her interrogator's armour. Leela manages to trick him and he dies at her feet, while she is still <b>strapped</b> to <b>machines</b> that are just barely keeping her alive. She tells more stories of her past to a child that is also held prisoner in the room. In her final tale, The Time Vampire, she recalls how K9 briefly flew into the Time Vortex and she had a vision of an [...] "ancient" [...] woman. Once her tale is told and she feels ready to die, K9 suddenly appears before her, frees her from her shackles and guides her soul to its next stage.|$|R
25|$|His {{second test}} {{leads him to}} a vat, {{at the bottom of}} which Judge Halden, who gave Dylan's killer six months in jail, is chained at the neck. Large dead pigs drop into a liquidiser and spray Judge Halden with liquified pig, but Jeff reluctantly sets fire to a cage full of Dylan's toys in order to {{retrieve}} the key (hidden inside one of the many toys) and save Halden. His third test brings him before Timothy Young, Dylan's killer, who is <b>strapped</b> to a <b>machine</b> that will twist his limbs and neck in turn until they break. The key is tied to the trigger of an enclosed shotgun. Jeff eventually tries to free Timothy, but taking the key discharges the shotgun and accidentally kills Halden, and Jeff is unable to stop the machine before Timothy's neck breaks.|$|R
50|$|In Arcane's lab, Abby is <b>strapped</b> into a <b>machine,</b> {{intended}} {{to be used in}} a procedure to cure Arcane's gradually degenerating body and making him immortal. As Zurrell cannot help her again without being caught, she obliges Abby the truth about her late mother's fate, who died due to a mistake on the part of Dr. Rochelle, the other scientist employed by Arcane. During the procedure, Arcane becomes high on the rejuvenation effects of the procedure and has the effect increased, resulting in Abby's body giving out; the procedure, however, is revealed to have been sabotaged by his lover, Dr. Lana Zurrell, who was slighted by his disregard for her life earlier in the film. Abby was ultimately revived by Swamp Thing after he retrieved her body from Arcane's lab, leaving Arcane to die in a fire.|$|R
500|$|A {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Craig Murray for the album's title track and was released in October 2009. The short video (1:40 in duration) shows {{a man and a}} woman <b>strapped</b> to a <b>machine,</b> a television that gives birth to a bio-mechanical creature and several disturbing clips in between. The video features stop motion animation influenced by horror films and has been referred to as [...] "terrifying," [...] "seizure-inducing," [...] "nightmarish," [...] "excruciating" [...] and [...] "gross" [...] by various sources. It was filmed in Ronda, Spain with the intent of making [...] "a film in which we see a cycle. This cycle will study an idea of new creation without pleasure and the art of numbing for progression." [...] Murray was inspired and influenced by artists Chris Cunningham, Gaspar Noé, Nine Inch Nails and the films Ringu, A Clockwork Orange and Hardware while making the music video. On November 7, the [...] "Axe to Fall" [...] video debuted on MTV2's heavy metal music program, Headbangers Ball.|$|R

40|$|This study {{reports the}} {{isolation}} of microorganisms that are resistant to environment containing limonene, the most important residue in the citrus industry. For the isolation, samples collected from strategic places of a citrus processing plant (yellow water, entrance and exit of the bagasse tank, effluent and deteriorated fruits found in bins, <b>machine</b> <b>straps,</b> fruit washers and plant floor), some citrus fruit and mint from local market were used. The samples were incubated in rotary shaker at 30 ºC/ 150 rpm for 48 h or 7 days in YM medium containing 0. 1 % limonene. Great part of the 112 strains recovered after 48 h and the 126 strains recovered after 7 days were identified as Gram positive bacilli, followed by Gram negative bacilli, yeasts and Gram positive cocci, besides five fungi. About half of the Gram positive and Gram negative bacilli and yeasts and some Gram positive Cocci were resistant to limonene concentrations up to 2 % in the medium broth. Amongst them seventy were able to grow in mineral medium containing limonene as sole carbon source. The research described in this paper is the initial step for the exploration of flavor compounds production via biotransformation of limonene, a nonexpensive by-product of citrus industry.
