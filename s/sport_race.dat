50|$|An {{important}} aspect of body culture is temporal. Modern society {{is characterized by the}} significance of speed and acceleration. Sport, giving priority to competitive running and racing, is central among the phenomena illustrating the specifically modern velocity (Eichberg 1978, Bale 2004). The historical change from the circulating stroll in aristocratic and early bourgeois culture to modern jogging as well as the changes from coach traffic via the railway (Schivelbusch 1977) to the <b>sport</b> <b>race</b> of automobiles (→auto racing) (Sachs 1984) produced new body-cultural configurations of social time.|$|E

40|$|In April 1993 Australian Rules footballer Nicky Winmar {{responded to}} on-field racist abuse by lifting his jersey and {{pointing}} to his chest. The photographic image of that event is now famous {{as a response to}} racial abuse and has come to be seen as starting a movement against racism in football. The racial connotations in the image might seem a foregone conclusion: the power, appeal and dominant meaning of the photograph might appear to be self-evident. But neither the fame of the image nor its racial connotation was automatic. Through interviews with the photographers and analysis of the use of the image in the media, we explore how that picture came to be of such symbolic importance, and how it has remained something to be re-shown and emulated. Rather than analyse the image as a photograph or work of art, we uncover some of its early history and explore the debates that continue to swirl around its purpose and meaning. We also draw attention to the way the careful study of photographs might enhance the study of <b>sport,</b> <b>race</b> and racism. ...|$|E
40|$|Avhandling (doktorgrad) - Norges idrettshøgskole, 2016 In this study, I {{explored}} how {{racism and}} marginalization in Norwegian sport are experienced by black Norwegian athletes. To accomplish this, I used {{the following research}} questions: 1. How are individual and institutional racism manifested in Norwegian organized sport? 2. What is the influence of gender on black athletes’ experiences of racism in Norwegian organized sport? In the first chapter, I outline the background, aim {{and scope of the}} study and the literature review. In the second chapter, I present the central conceptual and theoretical frameworks used in the study. The concepts of race, racism and racialization are contextualized in relation to the ways I have utilized them. I also present the Critical Race Theory (CRT) and black feminism (BF) theories that have been the main theoretical frameworks for this study. In chapter 3, I discuss the qualitative methodological approaches and the ways I utilized these approaches during different phases of planning, data collection and analysis. I also discuss how the theoretical frameworks of CRT and BF have informed my approaches to the different stages in the conduction of this study. In the fourth chapter, I summarize and discuss the major findings of the study and the theoretical implications. In the final chapter, I present concluding thoughts and avenues for future research.
