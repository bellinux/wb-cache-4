25|$|Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, Bell {{moved to}} Canada {{with his family}} in 1870 {{following}} the deaths of his brothers, and a year later moved to Boston to teach at a <b>special</b> <b>day</b> <b>school</b> for deaf children. Both Bell's mother and wife were deaf, profoundly influencing his life's work. He became a renowned educator by opening a private normal class to train teachers of speech to the deaf and as a professor of vocal physiology and the mechanics of speech at Boston University. During this time he also invented an improved phonautograph, the multiple telegraph, the speaking telegraph, or telephone, and numerous other devices.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:The {{purpose of}} this pilot study was to review the effects of {{professional}} staff training in crisis management and de-escalation techniques {{on the use of}} seclusion timeout and restraint procedures with at-risk students in a K- 12 <b>special</b> <b>day</b> <b>school.</b> An exploratory pre-post study was conducted over a two-year period, comparing the use of these behavior management interventions when all staff members were provided crisis intervention training. In addition, a brief survey was administered to all staff members con-cerning their training in and use of behavioral interventions. Results indicated professional staff training was effective in reducing (a) seclusion timeout procedures by more than one-third (39. 4 %) and (b) physical restraints (17. 6 %). This study also found staff members were not initiating seclusion timeout procedures primarily for the reasons they were trained (e. g., physical aggression) but rather for nonviolent behaviors such as leaving an assigned area and disrupting the classroom environment. Seclusion timeouts and physical restraint are two of the most restrictive behavioral inter-ventions schools rely on to manage the inap-propriate and aggressive behavior frequently dis-played by at-risk youth. recently, however, public awareness has been raised regarding the inherent dangers {{associated with the use of}} these aversive procedures. An investigative series in the Hartford Courant, a Connecticut newspaper, reported there were 142 restraint-related deaths across the united States over a 10 -year period (Weiss, 1998). Similar findings regarding the hazards of restraint and seclusion have been issued by the Governmen...|$|E

40|$|The use of psychotropic {{interventions}} {{to manage the}} inappropriate behaviors displayed by students with EBD has become more common {{over the past several}} decades (Forness, Kavale, Sweeney 2 Ì† 6 Crenshaw, 1999; Mattison, 1999). The efficacious use of these medications requires monitoring students for desired behavioral outcomes, as well as potential side effects. Educators are in an excellent position to monitor medication effectiveness and provide feedback to the prescribing physician, because they are in close proximity of students for up to six hours per <b>day.</b> Prior to <b>special</b> educators effectively performing these additional responsibilities however, it is essential to determine the types of psychotropic medications currently prescribed for students with EBD, in addition to the level of knowledge teachers have regarding these medications. To date, few studies have been conducted for students with EBD in the most restrictive placement settings (i. e., <b>special</b> <b>day</b> <b>schools</b> and residential facilities). ^ The purpose of this dissertation was to address four research questions: (1) Are there differences in the types and rates of incidence for psychotropic medications for students with EBD placed in <b>special</b> <b>day</b> <b>schools</b> and residential facilities? (2) Are appropriate monitoring procedures established within these settings to provide opportunities for staff members to provide feedback to prescribing physicians regarding behavioral improvements or adverse side effects caused by medications? (3) Do medication rates vary depending upon ethnicity, age, or gender of students? (4) Does teacher knowledge of psychotropic medications vary depending upon teaching experience, level of education, or type of educational placement setting? ^ In order to assess this information an exploratory study was conducted, in which a self-questionnaire pertaining to perceived knowledge of psychotropic medications was administered to a convenience sample of 74 special educators from 12 nonpublic residential and <b>special</b> <b>day</b> <b>schools.</b> In addition, medication records of 557 students serviced by these schools were reviewed to compare medication rates.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Education, Dept. of Curriculum and InstructionThis was a {{qualitative}} study that used a phenomenological approach {{to describe the}} conscious experiences of adolescents of varying cognitive abilities who have engaged in non-suicidal self- injurious behavior. Its purpose was to identify and analyze patterns or trends, including similarities and dissimilarities, among a sample of adolescents for whom such behavior has been a factor in their early development. This study reports on a sample of adolescents who attend a <b>special</b> <b>day</b> <b>school</b> in central Kansas for students with severe behavioral disorders and who have engaged in deliberate non-suicidal self-injury. Data were gathered through field notes taken during observation of student participants in the school setting, interviews with various stakeholders, and document review of participant/student IEP records. It was found that among students of average ability, cognitively distorted thought- processing and patterns of pervasive invalidating environmental cues form a combination of experiences that are apt to produce an atmosphere of emotional dysregulation conducive to the likelihood of adolescent self-injury. It was also found that among young people with severe intellectual disabilities, the tendency to self-injure is highly communicative in nature and less of a process than a need for immediate gratification or changes in environment. In addition, these needs are often of physiological bearing, more so than among the population without intellectual disability. Limitations {{of the current study}} were discussed, as well as needs for continuing research. Finally, best practice recommendations for school-based personnel working with self-injurious adolescents were addressed...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development of a funding mechanism, the Student Resource Index, which has been designed to resolve a number of difficulties which emerged following the introduction of integration or inclusion as an alternative means of providing educational support to students with disabilities in the Australian State of Victoria. Prior to 1984, the year in which the major integration or inclusion initiatives were introduced, the great majority of students with disabilities were educated in segregated special schools, however, by 1992 the integration initiatives had been successful in including within regular classes approximately half of the students in receipt of additional educational assistance on the basis of disability. The success of the integration program brought with it a number of administrative and financial problems which were the subject of three government enquiries. Central to these difficulties was the development of a dual system of special education provision. On one hand, additional resources were provided for the students attending segregated special schools by means of weighted student ratios, with one teacher being provided for each six students attending a special school. On the other hand, the requirements of individual students integrated into regular schools were assessed by school-based committees {{on the basis of their}} perceived extra educational needs. The major criticism of this dual system of special education funding was that it created inequities in the distribution of resources both between the systems and also within the systems. For example, three students with equivalent needs, one of whom attended a special school and two of whom attended different regular schools could each be funded at substantially differing levels. The solution to these inequities of funding was seen to be in the development of a needs based funding device which encompassed all students in receipt of additional disability related educational support. The Student Resource Index developed in this thesis is a set of behavioural descriptors designed to assess degree of additional educational need across a number of disability domains. These domains include hearing, vision, communication, health, co-ordination (manual and mobility), intellectual capacity and behaviour. The completed Student Resource Index provides a profile of the studentsâ€™ needs across all of these domains and as such addresses the multiple nature of many disabling conditions. The Student Resource Index was validated in terms of its capacity to predict the â€˜knownâ€™ membership or the type of special school which some 1200 students in the sample currently attended. The decision to use the existing special school populations as the criterion against which the Student Resource Index was validated was based on the premise that the differing resource levels of these schools had been historically determined by expert opinion, industrial negotiation and reference to other special education systems as the most reliable estimate of the enrolled studentsâ€™ needs. When discriminant function analysis was applied to some 178 students attending one school for students with mild intellectual disability and one facility for students with moderate to severe intellectual disability the Student Resource Index was successful in predicting the student 2 Ì† 7 s known school in 92 percent of cases. An analysis of those students (8 percent) which the Student Resource Index had failed to predict their known school enrolment revealed that 13 students had, for a variety of reasons, been inappropriately placed in these settings. When these students were removed from the sample the predictive accuracy of the Student Resource Index was raised to 96 percent of the sample. By comparison the domains of the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scale accurately predicted known enrolments of 76 percent of the sample. By way of replication discriminant function analysis was then applied to the Student Resource Index profiles of 518 students attending <b>Day</b> <b>Special</b> <b>Schools</b> (Mild Intellectual Disability) and 287 students attending Special Developmental Schools (Moderate to Severe Intellectual Disability). In this case, the Student Resource Index profiles were successful in predicting the known enrolments of 85 percent of students. When a third group was added, 147 students attending <b>Day</b> <b>Special</b> <b>Schools</b> for students with physical disabilities, the Student Resource Index predicted known enrolments in 80 percent of cases. The addition of a fourth group of 116 students attending <b>Day</b> <b>Special</b> <b>Schools</b> (Hearing Impaired) to the discriminant analysis led to a small reduction in predictive accuracy from 80 percent to 78 percent of the sample. A final analysis which included students attending a School for the Deaf-Blind, a Hospital School and a Social and Behavioural Unit was successful in predicting known enrolments in 71 percent of the 1114 students in the sample. For reasons which are expanded upon within the thesis it was concluded that the Student Resource Index when used in conjunction with discriminant function analysis was capable of isolating four distinct groups on the basis of their additional educational needs. If the historically determined and varied funding levels provided to these groups, inherent in the cash equivalent of the staffing ratios of <b>Day</b> <b>Special</b> <b>Schools</b> (Mild Intellectual Disability), Special Development Schools (Moderate to Severe Intellectual Disability), <b>Day</b> <b>Special</b> <b>Schools</b> (Physical Disability) and <b>Day</b> <b>Special</b> <b>Schools</b> (Hearing Impairment) are accepted as reasonable reflections of these studentsâ€™ needs these funding levels can be translated into funding bands. These funding bands can then be applied to students in segregated or inclusive placements. The thesis demonstrates that a new applicant for funding can be introduced into the existing data base and by the use of discriminant function analysis be allocated to one of the four groups. The analysis is in effect saying that this new studentâ€™s profile of educational needs has more in common with Group A than with the members of Groups B, C, or D. The student would then be funded at Group A level. It is immaterial from a funding point of view whether the student decides to attend a segregated or inclusive setting. The thesis then examines the impact of the introduction of Student Resource Index based funding upon the current funding of the special schools in one of the major metropolitan regions. Overall, such an initiative would lead to a reduction of 1. 54 percent of the total funding accruing to the regionâ€™s special schools...|$|R
