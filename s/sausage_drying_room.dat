40|$|The drying {{behaviour}} of dry-fermented sausage Petrovská klobása ripened {{in traditional}} and industrial conditions has been studied. Obtained {{results indicated that}} <b>sausages</b> <b>dried</b> in industrial <b>room</b> (batch I) had higher weight loss and lower water activity (aw) values than counterparts from traditional/artisanal production (batch T). Difference in drying intensity between internal and external fractions of sausages was much more marked for batch I. The experimental data of water content in Petrovská klobása, dried in respective conditions, were compared with values predicted by seven different mathematical models. Comparing the coefficient of determination (r 2), {{root mean square error}} (ERMS) and the reduced chi-square (χ 2) values of all equations, it was concluded that the Page mathematical model satisfactorily represents drying characteristics of Petrovská klobása both in traditional (0. 990; 2. 22 x 10 - 2 and 6. 01 x 10 - 4, respectively) and industrial conditions (0. 995; 1. 79 x 10 - 2; 3. 91 x 10 - 4, respectively) ...|$|R

These thresholds were measured for white noise, band-limited white noise and band-limited white noise mixed with a pure tone, in different reverberation conditions: acoustically <b>dry</b> <b>room,</b> two simulated source-image-based reverberations and natural reverberation with different configurations of loudspeaker arrays. Experiment 1 took place in a <b>dry</b> <b>room</b> and thresholds were measured with and without a reverberation simulation of an actual reverberant room.
