Recent {{advances in}} radiation therapy physics have enabled sophisticated treatment plans that conform accurately {{to the target}} volume while sparing normal tissue. The complex three- dimensional treatment planning requires dose verification (dosimetry) techniques that can validate with high spatial resolution in 3 D dose distribution with accuracy and precision. Routinely used dosimetry techniques include ionization chambers which can map very accurately but are restricted to a single plane or 2 D film based techniques. Gel dosimetry {{can be considered as}} 3 D integrating dosimeters that offer high spatial resolution, precision and accuracy for the verification of a large range of treatment plans. However, gel dosimetry has not been evaluated {{for a wide range of}} treatment plans, especially using more advanced radiation therapy units such as Stereotactic Radiosurgery. In addition gel dose readouts are performed with Magnetic Resonance Imaging sequences that are extremely long, precluding routine usage of this technique in a clinical setting. 	This thesis is focused on establishing gel dosimetry as a viable method for clinical use to validate a wide variety of treatment plans.

40|$|BACKGROUND and OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} water and {{vitreous}} flow rates and duty cycle (DC) between two ultrahigh-speed vitrectomy systems: pneumatic with spring return (SR) and dual pneumatic (DP) probes. MATERIALS and METHODS: the flow rate was calculated using a high-sampling precision balance that measured the mass of water and vitreous removed from a vial by a vitreous cutter. Frame-by-frame analysis of a high-speed video of the cutter {{was used to determine}} the DC. Three cutters of each gauge (20, 23, and 25 G) were tested with an SR and a DP system using the standard DC setting (biased open) at 0 (water only), 1, 000, 2, 000, 3, 000, 4, 000, and 5, 000 cuts per minute (CPM) with aspiration levels of 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 mm Hg.
