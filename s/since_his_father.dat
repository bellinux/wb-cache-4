25|$|On 6 September 2006, the Emperor {{celebrated the}} birth of his first grandson, Prince Hisahito, the third child of the Emperor's younger son. Prince Hisahito is the first male heir born to the Japanese {{imperial}} family in 41 years (<b>since</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> Prince Akishino) and could avert a possible succession crisis as the Emperor's elder son, the Crown Prince Naruhito, has only one daughter, Princess Aiko. Under Japan's male-only succession law, Princess Aiko is not eligible for the throne. The birth of Prince Hisahito could mean that proposed changes to the law to allow Aiko to ascend the Chrysanthemum Throne will not go through after being temporarily shelved following the announcement of Princess Kiko's third pregnancy in February 2006. The supporters of changes criticized the current law as it placed a burden on the few aging males old enough to perform royal duties as females left the family.|$|E

25|$|The first Filipinos {{immigrants}} {{that came}} to the United States were treated {{the same way as}} any other group of immigrants. When the first group of Filipinos joined the theater community they also received a lot of backlash. One of the most common instances are racial issues. One of the most popular plays that had a lot of filipino actors, Miss Saigon, had the issue of casting a white actor for an Asian role (113). With this, it exposed the history of yellow face within the theater community. Another issue that was faced due to Miss Saigon was when it had its own production in the Philippines. J.V Ejercito, the owner of the production of Miss Saigon, {{became a member of the}} Philippine congress. J.V Ejercito’s background stirred up controversies <b>since</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> Joseph Estrada was still in power when the production was going on. The public implied that the production gained it money not through profit but through politics and free enterprise. During the production of Miss Saigon, the international work force for Filipinos was also rising. Filipinos were seen as Little Brown Fucking Machines (LBFM) my military men thus giving Filipinos the roles of prostitutes within plays. Because of Miss Saigon, Filipinos were then seen as maids and domestic helpers.|$|E
