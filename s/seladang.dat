5000|$|Strictly, {{the school}} has no {{official}} motto at all. The first motto is actually that of the school newspaper, [...] "The Seladang", founded in October 1953. It was selected by the first editor, R. Nithiahnanthan, and displayed on its front page banner under {{the head of the}} <b>seladang</b> taken from the school crest. Over the time the motto seems to have been hijacked as that of the school. The motto is derived from the Biblical proverb, [...] "Give instruction to a wise man and he will be yet wiser."

5000|$|The gaur has a head-and-body {{length of}} 250 to 330 cm with a 70 to 105 cm long tail, and is 142 to 220 cm high at the shoulder, {{averaging}} about 168 cm in females and 188 cm in males. At {{the top of}} its muscular hump just behind its shoulder, an average adult male is just under 200 cm tall and the male's girth at its mid-section (behind its shoulders) averages about 277 cm. Males are about one-fourth larger and heavier than females. Body mass can range widely from 440 to 1000 kg in adult females and 588 to 1500 kg in adult males. In general measurements are derived from gaurs surveyed in India. Indian gaur males averaged about 840 kg (in a sample of 13) and females weigh a median of approximately 700 kg. Body masses elsewhere suggest gaurs outside of India can grow larger. For example, males from China (B. g. laosiensis) can weigh 1200 kg or more. The <b>Seladang,</b> or Malayasian subspecies, (B. g. hubbacki) appears to be larger on average than the nominate race from India but sample sizes as known are small. According to some sources, <b>seladang</b> bulls weigh on average 1000 to 1300 kg, which if accurate indicate these animals are on average more than 20% more massive than the gaurs of India.|$|E
50|$|Perak The Bos Gaurus has {{historically}} utilised one primary crest. The first, adopted when {{the club was}} founded, was {{the image of a}} Malayan Tiger, where it is famous in Malaya and remained for more than half-century. In 2015, in effort to modernise the club, a new crest was introduced to replace the old crest as the club main crest. The club replaced the old crest with new logo and adopted the image <b>Seladang</b> which is more synonym with the Perak football team. After being criticized for the lack of quality for the logo, Perak The Bos Gaurus launched {{a new version of the}} logo chosen from the logo competition held by the team for 2016 season onwards.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from its}} variety of fish, {{the town of}} Temerloh also {{offers a variety of}} jungle and wild-life experiences. The Kuala Krau Wildlife Reserve, a virgin forest reserve with {{untouched}} flora and fauna, is also where you can find the Kuala Gandah Elephant Conservation Centre and the <b>Seladang</b> Breeding Center. Gunung Senyum Recreational Forest, a paradise for nature and cave lovers is just about 20 km away. Located at Bukit Rengit, Lanchang, the Deerland Park is where you can learn not only about deer, feed and touch them, but also other animals such as ostrich, peacock, tuna deer, nilga deer (India) and wood-duck (Canada). Home to the albino monkey, porcupine, black leopard, civet, the Malayan gharial crocodile and alligators, the town's mini zoo covers over 1.5 ha of land, and is located at Jalan Bahagia, near Kampung Sungai Rabit. There's also a recreational park located {{right in the middle of}} Temerloh town, behind the Courthouse, called Taman Bandar (Town Park). Among the facilities provided here are skate-board track, playground, jogging trails and a mini stadium.|$|E
50|$|Stevens {{accompanied}} the Roosevelts up the Irawaddy to the Chinese-Burma border {{and then in}} January 1929 went north from Tengyueh with his own caravan. During all of February he collected specimens at the Lijiang bend. He then moved north to collect in Sichuan and spent May in the Wushi hills. After some further collecting he went down the Yangtze to Shanghai, sending 2,400 specimens to the Field Museum. After separating from Stevens's section of the expedition, the Roosevelt brothers with Suydam Cutting went rapidly north to collect specimens of the giant panda. The Roosevelts hunted large mammals that were especially rare. Their party proceeded through Burma to Bhamo and northward to Tatsienlu thence to Mouping. Then going southward through Yachow, they crossed the Qingyi (Tung) River and continued their journey traveling slightly east of the Panlong River and reaching the railhead at Yunnanfu. From there, Kermit Roosevelt returned to the United States upon an urgent request. Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. and Suydam Cutting continued to the vicinity of Saigon to procure specimens of banteng, <b>seladang,</b> and water buffalo.|$|E
40|$|<b>Seladang</b> food {{preferences}} primarily {{depended on}} the habitat types within their home range.   Shrubs and grasses were their main food sources.   The types of food species preferred by <b>seladang</b> in each habitat types were unknown. In this study, the food species were identified and classified according to the intensity of browsing and grazing capacity of <b>seladang</b> within each habitat type {{such as in the}} primary forests, secondary forests and agricultural areas. Study plots and sub-plots were selected based on feeding habit and footprint signs. The results of this study found that 17 species of shrubs and 6 species of grasses were preferred by <b>seladang.</b> S. acuminata (7. 95 %) was the most preferable species of shrubs in the primary forest, Melastoma malabathricum (10. 42 %) in the secondary forest and Erythrina variegata (18. 56 %) in the agriculture area. The amount of grass species eaten by <b>seladang</b> is not significantly different but Imperata cylindrica was grazed in the primary forest compared to Paspalum conjugatum in the secondary forest and Paspalum vaginatum in agricultural area. </p...|$|E

40|$|The Malayan gaur (Bos gaurus hubbacki) or <b>Seladang</b> is {{classified}} as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). The Malayan gaur is mainly distributed in the tropical woodlands of Peninsular Malaysia and Southern Thailand. The {{aim of this study}} was to collect, analyze and cryopreserve the semen of wild Malayan gaur. Transrectal massage (TM) and electroejaculation (EEJ) technique was applied in semen collection of the Malayan gaur. The semen was then cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen using slow freezing technique. Makler counting chamber was used to evaluate sperm concentration and motility, while the sperm viability and morphology of fresh and post-thaw sperm was determined using eosin-nigrosin staining protocol. As a result, we have successfully collected the Malayan gaur semen using EEJ technique. Sperm motility, viability and morphological changes of the post-thaw semen of Malayan gaur were found undesirable due to the complication of the cryopreservation process. On the basis of current study it can be concluded that Malayan gaur bulls semen can be obtain by EEJ with no evidence of rectal trauma. Optimization of the process of cryopreservation for Malayan gaur sperm is needed to maintain the cryoviability of the good sperm quality. The data generated in this study would be useful in conservation of genetic diversity program for Malayan gaur...|$|E
