6000|$|... "That won't be so {{much help}} to the old lady," [...] said the storekeeper, [...] "for it wouldn't pay to keep a neffy-in-law just to doctor one <b>sorrel</b> <b>horse</b> and a pa'r o' oxen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And the laird of Girdingburst has had {{his running}} footman here, and ca'd himsell (he's a civil {{pleasant}} young gentleman), to see when the broidered saddle-cloth for his <b>sorrel</b> <b>horse</b> will be ready, for he wants it agane the Kelso races." ...|$|E
60|$|Where {{the road}} zigzagged above, they glimpsed {{through the trees}} four <b>sorrel</b> <b>horses</b> {{trotting}} swiftly, and the flying wheels of a small, tan-painted trap.|$|R
5000|$|Koniks {{today are}} bred either in barns or open {{reserves}} and under human guidance. The Konik was bred {{for a larger}} shoulder height in past decades, to improve its value as a working horse. A more graceful appearance, especially of the head, was established, as well. Black and <b>sorrel</b> <b>horses</b> have been largely selected out, but still appear on occasion, as do white markings. [...] The simultaneous management of Koniks in both barns and reserves {{made it possible to}} compare the health and behaviour of the horses under different circumstances. For example, hoof diseases and hay allergies are more common in Koniks raised in barns than in reserves.|$|R
2500|$|Her <b>sorrel</b> quarter <b>horses</b> [...] "Lady Phase" [...] and [...] "Skipster’s Chief" [...] were {{produced}} as plastic models by Breyer Animal Creations. [...] "Skipster’s Chief" [...] {{was also the}} poster horse for the North American Riding for the Handicapped Association.|$|R
6000|$|The ranger smiled. [...] "Oh, it's got to {{all come}} out, Busby. I {{saw the man}} on the <b>sorrel</b> <b>horse</b> fire that shot--don't forget that. And I know who made the tracks in the flour. But I am {{beginning}} to wonder if you {{had anything to do with}} warning the Kauffmans to get out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well," [...] {{said the}} ranger, [...] "we'll {{find out in}} the course of time. My {{eyesight}} is pretty keen, and I can swear that it was the man on the <b>sorrel</b> <b>horse</b> that fired the shot that stopped the Kauffman team. Now {{one or the other of}} you will have to answer to that charge." [...] His voice took on a sterner note. [...] "What were you doing on Watson's porch last Saturday?" ...|$|E
60|$|After a {{very early}} breakfast next morning, Mrs Keswick set out upon her journey, driving the <b>sorrel</b> <b>horse</b> with much steadiness, intermingled with {{severity}} whenever he allowed himself {{to drop out of}} his usual jogging pace. Plez sat in the back part of the spring-wagon, and whenever the old lady saw an unusually large stone lying in the track of the road, she would stop, and make him get out and throw it to one side.|$|E
50|$|Royal Santana was a 1971 <b>sorrel</b> Quarter <b>Horse</b> gelding sired by Peppy San {{and out of}} a mare named Royal Smart. Royal Smart was a {{daughter}} of Royal King {{and out of a}} descendant of Traveler named Moss Jackie Tobin.|$|R

50|$|Docs Okie Quixote (1980—1985), AQHA #1613457, was a <b>sorrel</b> Quarter <b>Horse</b> stallion. In 1984, {{he became}} the second horse ever to win the NCHA Triple Crown, and 1st to be owned, trained, and ridden by the same person, Joe Heim, of Thackerville, OK.|$|R
60|$|Having {{reached this}} point in her cogitations, she also reached {{the point in the}} road where Ida Mayberry still sat making her plans, and {{concealed}} from the view of those coming {{from the direction of the}} highroad by a mass of projecting elderberry bushes. Hearing an approaching vehicle, the young woman on the horizontal limb, not wishing to be seen perched upon this elevated seat, sprang to the ground, which she touched about four feet from the nose of the <b>sorrel</b> <b>horse.</b>|$|E
60|$|About {{this time}} a phaeton, drawn by a stout <b>sorrel</b> <b>horse,</b> and {{containing}} Miss Calthea Rose, was turning from the highroad into this lane. As a rule, Miss Calthea greatly preferred walking to driving, and although her father had left her a horse and several vehicles, she seldom made personal use of them; but to-day {{she was going to}} Romney, which was too far away for walking, and she had planned to stop at the Squirrel Inn and ask Mrs. Cristie to go with her.|$|E
60|$|As that lady, {{stepping}} out upon the piazza, swept her eyes over {{the scene and}} beheld the couple on the lawn, she gave a jerk to the glove she was drawing on her hand that tore in it a slit three inches long. She then turned her eyes upon her phaeton, declined the offer of Mr. Petter to see her home, and, after a leave-taking which {{was a little more}} effusive than was usual with her, drove herself to Lethbury. If the <b>sorrel</b> <b>horse</b> had behaved badly {{in the early part of}} that afternoon, he was punished for it in the early part of that evening, for he completely broke all previous records of time made between the Squirrel Inn and Lethbury.|$|E
60|$|When {{my first}} {{confusion}} had passed away, I found that I {{was lying in}} a dense green glen {{at the foot of}} a cliff. For some moments I could think of nothing but my extraordinary escape from destruction. Within reach of my hand lay the creature who had carried me, huddled and motionless; and to left and to right of me, and one a little nearer the base of the cliff, five of those <b>sorrel</b> <b>horses</b> that had been chief of our pursuers. One only of them was alive, and he, also, broken and unable to rise--unable to do else than watch with fierce, untamed, glazing eyes (a bloody froth at his muzzle,) every movement and sign of life I made.|$|R
6000|$|The girl, who {{understood}} {{the significance of}} this controversy, interposed. [...] "I'll ride the <b>sorrel.</b> He's my <b>horse,</b> anyway." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1702, William died of pneumonia, a {{complication}} from {{a broken}} collarbone following a fall from his <b>horse,</b> <b>Sorrel.</b> The <b>horse</b> had been confiscated from Sir John Fenwick, one of the Jacobites who had conspired against William. Because his horse had stumbled into a mole's burrow, many Jacobites toasted [...] "the little gentleman in the black velvet waistcoat." [...] Years later, Winston Churchill, in his A History of the English-Speaking Peoples, stated that the fall [...] "opened {{the door to a}} troop of lurking foes". William was buried in Westminster Abbey alongside his wife. His sister-in-law, Anne, became queen regnant of England, Scotland and Ireland.|$|R
60|$|But the <b>sorrel</b> <b>horse</b> did not move; he had {{two reasons}} for refusing to obey his mistress. In the first place, on general {{principles}} he disliked to back, and was fully conscious that Miss Calthea could not make him do it, {{and in the second}} place, he wanted a drink, and did not intend to move until he got it. Just here the brook was at its widest and deepest, and it came so near the road that in shying Sultan had entered it so far that the front wheels of the phaeton nearly touched the water. Standing more than fetlock deep in this cool stream, {{it is no wonder that}} Sultan wanted some one to loosen his check-rein and let him drink.|$|E
60|$|By {{nine o'clock}} we were meeting our first obstacle--the little hill {{at which the}} <b>sorrel</b> <b>horse</b> had balked. Lo! rested and full of grain, he balked again! He ruined our start. He spoiled the teams. Lee had more {{patience}} than I would have had. He unhitched the lead team and {{in place of the}} sorrel put a saddle horse called Pacer. Then Doyle tried again and surmounted the hill. Our saddle horses slowly worked ahead over as rocky and rough a road as I ever traveled. Most of the time we could see over the rim down into the basin. Along here the rim appeared to wave in gentle swells, heavily timbered and thickly rock-strewn, with heads of canyons opening down to our right. I saw deer tracks and turkey tracks, neither of which occasioned me any thrills now. About {{the middle of the afternoon}} Edd bade us farewell and turned back. We were sorry to see him go, but as all the country ahead of us was as unfamiliar to him as to us there seemed to be no urgent need of him.|$|E
60|$|But Fanfulla and the {{servants}} joined their advice to Peppe's, and prevailed at last upon Francesco to take cover until this company should have passed. He consented, to pacify them, and wheeling {{to the right}} they entered {{the border of the}} forest, drawing rein well in the shadow, whence they could survey the road and see who passed across the patch of moonlight that illumined it. And presently the company came along and swung into that revealing flood of light. To the astonishment of the watchers they beheld no marauding party such as they had been led to expect, but a very orderly company of some twenty men, soberly arrayed in leather hacketons and salades of bright steel, marching sword on thigh and pike on shoulder. At the head of this company rode a powerfully-built man on a great <b>sorrel</b> <b>horse,</b> at sight of whom the fool swore softly in astonishment. In the middle of the party came four litters borne by mules, and at the side of one of them rode a slender, graceful figure that provoked from Peppe a second oath. But the profoundest objurgation of all was wrung from him at sight of a portly bulk in the black habit of the Dominicans ambling in the rear, who just then was in angry altercation with a fellow that was urging his mule along with the butt of his partisan.|$|E
50|$|More {{often than}} not, the {{practical}} difference {{is usually not}} in color, but in usage: horses ridden in the Western tradition are more {{often referred to as}} <b>sorrel</b> and <b>horses</b> ridden in the English tradition are chestnut. Many organizations simply avoid the whole fuss and choose one of the two terms to denote all reddish or brown colorations that are not bay.|$|R
50|$|Dallas' old <b>sorrel</b> gelding Quarter <b>Horse,</b> {{now retired}} from ranch work and living out his golden years on River Bend Ranch.Amigo is brought out of {{retirement}} sometimes when they need a good quiet cow-horse.|$|R
50|$|The Old <b>Sorrel</b> sired 116 <b>horses</b> {{registered}} with the AQHA, but through the linebreeding program the King Ranch used, almost every horse the King Ranch registered from 1940 to the early 1960s {{was at least a}} descendant of Old Sorrel, and most were heavily inbred to him.|$|R
60|$|During {{the summer}} I had {{purchased}} a famous chestnut <b>sorrel</b> <b>horse</b> named Don Carlos. He was much in demand among the motion-picture companies doing western plays; and was really too fine and splendid a horse {{to be put}} to the risks common to the movies. I saw him first at Palm Springs, down in southern California, where my book Desert Gold was being made into a motion-picture. Don would not have failed to strike any one as being a wonderful horse. He was tremendously high and rangy and powerful in build, yet graceful withal, a sleek, shiny chestnut red in color, with fine legs, broad chest, and a magnificent head. I rode him only once before I bought him, and that was before I hurt my back. His stride was what one would expect from sight of him; his trot seemed to tear me to pieces; his spirit was such that he wanted to prance all the time. But in spite of his spirit he was a pet. And how he could run! Nielsen took Don to Flagstaff by express. And when Nielsen wrote me he said all of Flagstaff came down to the station to see the famous Don Carlos. The car in which he had traveled was backed alongside a platform. Don refused to step on the boards they placed from platform to car. He did not trust them. Don's intelligence had been sharpened by his experience with the movies. Nielsen tried to lead, to coax, and to drive Don to step on the board walk. Don would not go. But suddenly he snorted, and jumped the space clear, to plunge and pound down upon the platform, scattering the crowd like quail.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Sorrel</b> <b>Horse,</b> is a pub {{that dates}} back to the 15th century. As of August 2011 it was bought collectively by the community, the shares that were sold managed to raise £450,000 to keep the <b>Sorrel</b> <b>Horse</b> open.|$|E

500|$|The {{foundation}} sire of {{the modern}} Suffolk Punch breed was a [...] stallion foaled near Woodbridge in 1768 and owned by Thomas Crisp of Ufford. [...] At this time the breed {{was known as the}} Suffolk <b>Sorrel.</b> This <b>horse</b> was never named, and is simply known as [...] "Crisp's horse". [...] Although it is commonly (and mistakenly) thought that this was the first horse of the breed, by the 1760s, all other male lines of the breed had died out, resulting in a genetic bottleneck. Another bottleneck occurred in the late 18th century.|$|R
50|$|The Phantom's dam, a <b>sorrel</b> Quarter <b>Horse</b> {{once owned}} by the Forsters. Wyatt sold the mare to the Kenworthys right after Sam's accident, {{almost as if he}} blamed her for Blackie kicking Sam in the head by mistake. She was bred twice more while under her new ownership, once to Smoke a second time that {{produced}} the Phantom's sister (Hoku), and again to Golden Champagne (Champ). The second pregnancy did not come to term, and most people think she aborted the baby due to stress. Kitty ended up in Linc's pastures after he bought the Kenworthy's ranch, where she lived mostly by herself until she was chosen as a friend and foster mother for Boots.|$|R
60|$|Venters {{loosened}} the rein on Wrangle {{and let him}} {{break into}} a gallop. The <b>sorrel</b> saw the <b>horses</b> ahead and wanted to run. But Venters restrained him. And in the gallop he gained {{more than in the}} canter. Bells was fast in that gait, but Black Star and Night had been trained to run. Slowly Wrangle closed the gap down to a quarter of a mile, and crept closer and closer.|$|R

5000|$|The {{historic}} Rancho Arroyo Bayo {{was located}} where Blumbago Canyon Creek joins Arroyo Bayo. The section of Mt. Hamilton Road east of Mt.

6000|$|... "Look at {{that level}} rump, Dick," [...] she said, [...] "and those {{trotting}} feet and pasterns." [...] And, to Graham: [...] "Rather different from Nymph's long wrists, aren't they? But they're just what I was after." [...] She laughed a little, with just a shade of annoyance. [...] "The dam was a bright sorrel-- almost like a fresh-minted twenty-dollar piece--and I did so want a pair out of her, of the same color, for my own trap. Well, I can't say that I exactly got them, although I bred her to a splendid, <b>sorrel</b> trotting <b>horse.</b> And this is my reward, this black--and, wait till {{we get to the}} brood mares and you'll see the other, a full brother and mahogany brown. I'm so disappointed." ...|$|R
5000|$|Peppy San Badger, foaled in 1974 {{and also}} known as “Little Peppy”, was a <b>sorrel</b> American Quarter <b>Horse</b> {{stallion}} bred by Joe Kirk Fulton of Lubbock, Texas by the cutting sire Mr San Peppy and out of Sugar Badger, a daughter of Grey Badger III. He was born at Fulton’s ranch and began early basic training there before he became ill with strangles. Upon recovering from the illness, Peppy San Badger was sold to the King Ranch of South Texas in 1977, where he remained a breeding stallion until his death.|$|R
50|$|When Jefferson {{retired in}} 1809 he had {{accumulated}} many possessions while in Washington, {{which included a}} huge collection of books. Organizing and packing these things was a great task. Jefferson summoned Bacon to come to Washington with two servants to help him pack, load and supervise the transport of these things back to Monticello. Together they loaded about thirty crates which would {{be sent back to}} Monticello by water. The remaining items were loaded into three wagons which Bacon brought up from Monticello and along with the servants drove them back to Jeffersons estate, departing Washington on March ninth or tenth. Jefferson followed him on Saturday, the eleventh. Bacon later recalled the event in his memoirs. I had three wagons from Monticello -- two six mule teams loaded with boxes, and the other four <b>sorrel</b> Chickasaw <b>horses,</b> and the wagon pretty much loaded with shrubbery from Maines nursery. The servants rode on these wagons. I had the carriage horses and carriage, and rode behind them. After a five-day ride through snow Jefferson arrived home at Monticello on March 15.|$|R
