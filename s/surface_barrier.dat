2500|$|Result (23) {{also leads}} to some {{understanding}} {{of what happens when}} atomic-level effects are taken into account, and the band-structure is no longer free-electron like. Due to the presence of the atomic ion-cores, the <b>surface</b> <b>barrier,</b> and also the electron wave-functions at the surface, will be different. This will affect the values of the correction factor , the prefactor P, and (to a limited extent) the correction factor λ'd. These changes will, in turn, affect the values of the parameter DF and (to a limited extent) the parameter dF. For a real metal, the supply density will vary with position in energy space, and the value at point [...] "F" [...] may be different from the Sommerfeld supply density. We can take account of this effect by introducing an electronic-band-structure correction factor λB into eq. (23). Modinos has discussed how this factor might be calculated: he estimates that it is most likely to be between 0.1 and 1; it might lie outside these limits but is most unlikely to lie outside the range 0.01<λB<10.|$|E
