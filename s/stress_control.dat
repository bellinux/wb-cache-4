25|$|Figures {{from the}} 1982 Lebanon war showed that with {{proximal}} treatment 90% of CSR casualties {{returned to their}} unit, usually within 72 hours. With rearward treatment only 40% returned to their unit. It was also found that treatment efficacy went up with {{the application of a}} variety of front line treatment principles versus just one treatment. In Korea, similar statistics were seen, with 85% of US battle fatigue casualties returned to duty within three days and 10% returned to limited duties after several weeks. Though these numbers seem to promote the claims that proximal PIE or BICEPS treatment is generally effective at reducing the effects of combat stress reaction, other data suggests that long term PTSD effects may result from the hasty return of affected individuals to combat. Both PIE and BICEPS are meant to return as many soldiers as possible to combat, and may actually have adverse effects on the long term health of service members who are rapidly returned to the front-line after combat <b>stress</b> <b>control</b> treatment. Although the PIE principles were used extensively in the Vietnam War, the post traumatic stress disorder lifetime rate for Vietnam veterans was 30% in a 1989 US study and 21% in a 1996 Australian study. In a study of Israeli Veterans of the 1973 Yom Kippur War, 37% of veterans diagnosed with CSR during combat were later diagnosed with PTSD, compared with 14% of control veterans.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the potential regulatory effects of various coping strategies on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). It first divided PTSD symptoms and selected coping strategies into cognitive, social/motivational, and emotional types. The study then conceptualized each of the preceding types of coping strategies as being <b>controlled</b> <b>stress</b> responses and the PTSD symptoms as being semiautomatic stress responses. It lastly proposed that coping strategies be further divided into activating <b>controlled</b> <b>stress</b> response and deactivating <b>controlled</b> <b>stress</b> response. <b>Controlled</b> <b>stress</b> responses are coping strategies that are consciously initiated and implemented. Semiautomatic stress responses are PTSD symptoms that spontaneously emerge without conscious intent. Activating <b>controlled</b> <b>stress</b> responses consisted of the following coping strategies: seeking understanding, avoidant actions, and expressing feelings. Deactivating <b>controlled</b> <b>stress</b> responses encompassed: positive cognitive restructuring, emotion-focused support, and physical release of emotions. Semiautomatic stress responses entailed: reexperiencing, numbing, and arousal symptoms.

50|$|Analyzers {{are made}} for both stress (force) and strain (displacement) control. In strain control, the probe is {{displaced}} and the resulting stress of the sample is measured by implementing a force balance transducer, which utilizes different shafts. The advantages of strain control include a better short time response for materials of low viscosity and experiments of stress relaxation are done with relative ease. In <b>stress</b> <b>control,</b> a set {{force is applied to}} the same and several other experimental conditions (temperature, frequency, or time) can be varied. <b>Stress</b> <b>control</b> is typically less expensive than strain control because only one shaft is needed, but this also makes it harder to use. Some advantages of <b>stress</b> <b>control</b> include the fact that the structure of the sample is less likely to be destroyed and longer relaxation times/ longer creep studies can be done with much more ease. Characterizing low viscous materials come at a disadvantage of short time responses that are limited by inertia. Stress and strain control analyzers give about the same results as long as characterization is within the linear region of the polymer in question. However, <b>stress</b> <b>control</b> lends a more realistic response because polymers have a tendency to resist a load.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of the detailed studies on <b>stress</b> - <b>controlled</b> cyclic triaxial tests on sandy soils from Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India subjected to a loading frequency of 0. 1 Hz in cyclic triaxial equipment. Undrained <b>stress</b> <b>controlled</b> cyclic triaxial tests were carried out on cylindrical samples of size 50 mm diameter and height 100 mm with different cyclic stress ratios. Laboratory evaluations were carried out to compare the cyclic resistance of clean sand to that of sand with various fines contents at a constant gross void ratio. The gross void ratio considers the voids formed by sand particles and fines. The effects of gross void ratio with and without fines on pore water pressure build up and liquefaction potential of sandy soils in <b>stress</b> <b>controlled</b> tests are presented.

50|$|As {{with paper}} insulation, {{the control of}} {{electric}} stress fields remains important. Resin insulation has greater dielectric strength than paper and requires less <b>stress</b> <b>control</b> at voltages below 25 kV. However, some compact and higher rated switchgear designs, have earthed materials closer to bushings {{than in the past}} and these designs may require <b>stress</b> <b>control</b> screens in resin bushings operating as low as 12 kV Fixing points are often integral with the main resin form, and present fewer problems to earthed materials than the metal flanges used on paper bushings. However, care must be observed in resin insulated bushings designs which use internally cast screens such that the benefit of electrical stress field control is not off set by increasing partial discharge caused by the difficulties of eliminating micro voids in the resin around the screens during the casting process. The need to eliminate voids in resin becomes more sensitive as voltages increases, and it is normal to revert to resin impregnated, foiled paper insulation for bushings rated over 72.5 kV.|$|E
