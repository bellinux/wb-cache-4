40|$|In {{recent years}} a {{significant}} volume {{of research has}} been undertaken {{in order to understand}} the recent failures <b>in</b> <b>oil</b> insulated power apparatus due to deposition of copper sulphide on the conductors and in the insulation paper. Dibenzyl Disulfide (DBDS) has been found to be the leading corrosive <b>sulphur</b> <b>compound</b> <b>in</b> the insulation <b>oil</b> [1]. The process of copper sulphide formation and the deposition in the paper is still being investigated, but a recently proposed method seems to be gaining some confidence [1]. This method suggests a two-step process; initially the DBDS and some oil soluble copper complexes are formed. Secondly the copper complexes are absorbed in the paper insulation, where they then decompose into copper sulphide [2]. The most commonly used mitigating technique for corrosive sulphur contaminated oil is passivation, normally using Irgamet 39 or 1, 2, 3 -benzotriazole (BTA). The passivator is diluted into the oil to a concentration of around 100 ppm, where it then reacts with the copper conductors to form a complex layer around the copper, preventing it from interacting with DBDS compounds and forming copper sulphide. This research project will investigate the electrical properties of HV transformers which have tested positive for corrosive sulphur, and the evolution of those properties as the asset degrades due to sulphur corrosion. Parallel to this the long term properties of transformers with passivated insulation oil will be analysed {{in order to understand the}} passivator stability and whether it is necessary to keep adding the passivator to sustain its performance. Condition monitoring techniques under investigation will include dielectric spectroscopy, frequency response analysis, recovery voltage method (aka interfacial polarisation) amongst others. Partial discharge techniques will not be investigated, as the voltage between the coil plates is low and therefore it will not contribute significantly to the overall insulation breakdown, <b>in</b> corrosive <b>oil</b> related faults [3]. The goal of this research is to establish key electrical properties in both passivated and non-passivated power transformers that demonstrate detectable changes as the equipment degrades due to the insulation oil being corrosive...|$|R
40|$|Petroleum {{refining}} {{is among}} the most important industries in the world. The oil refinery products contribute in many essential issues in the human life including transportation fuels, heating fuels, petrochemical industries, etc. Although oil refining is an old process started in the mid of the 19 th century, new developments and technologies are introduced frequently due to the large amount of studies conducted around the world research centres. Some of the petroleum refining processes gain more attention in terms of research and development {{in the last couple of}} decades. For example, the importance of developing the hydrocracking process is increasing due to the increasing amount of heavy unconventional oil reserves. Another hot topic is the development of the hydrodesulphurization process due to the environmental concern about the sulphur oxides emissions produced by using oil refinery streams that contain several organic <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds.</b> <b>In</b> this work, commercially available slurry catalyst precursors are tested to study the impact of the catalyst preparation conditions on its characteristic and activity. Those types of catalysts are used for hydrocracking and upgrading processes of heavy crude and residue including sulphur and other metal removal. The main subject was to approach the desulphurization activity and selectivity of the catalyst in removing dibenzothiophene (DBT) from model feed. DBT is one of the refractory <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> <b>in</b> the heavy <b>oil</b> fractions. It was found that changing the preparation conditions in terms of temperature, pressure and sulphiding agent influenced the activity and selectivity of the produced catalyst between the direct desulphurization reaction pathway and hydrogenation reaction pathway in removing DBT. The highest conversion was achieved by using cobalt-molybdenum-sulphide catalyst (Co-Mo-S) where up to 94. 0 wt% of the DBT was converted. Adding the same catalyst precursor directly to Arab heavy crude oil, high desulphurization level was achieved where 70 wt% of the sulphur content of the feed has been removed. In addition, there is a high potential to increase this desulphurization level in treating heavy crude by applying the optimum operation conditions used in presulphiding the catalyst precursor. Ionic liquids (ILs) were also employed for sulphur removal from refinery streams by liquid-liquid extraction process. The ILs are organic salts with low melting points, mostly at room temperatures. Although the sulphur extraction level was very low comparing with the conventional hydrotreating process, this process has the advantage of minimizing the operation costs by reducing the reaction severity in terms of temperature and hydrogen consumption. Around 80 wt% of DBT was removed from model compound using one of the tested ILs. The nitrogen removal was also very high where almost 99 wt% of pyridine was removed from the model oil. However, the sulphur extraction level decreased in treating diesel fuel due to several factors such as the aromatic contents of the feed and the existence of several <b>sulphur</b> and metal <b>compounds.</b> To overcome this problem, the extraction process was repeated several times using fresh batches of ILs. This point has driven the importance of developing an efficient regeneration method for the used IL which was also approached in this work.

These regulations place many challenges for the refining industry. Lower sulphur levels are being recommended for gasoline and diesel for environmental reasons. New methods and innovations are required to further reduce the sulphur level in liquid fuels. Separation process design to accomplish the removal of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> requires knowledge of the vapour-liquid equilibrium (VLE) of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> with hydrocarbons, particularly their activity coefficients at infinite dilution. However, the investigations concerning the systems containing <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> are very limited. This thesis deals with the VLE measurements of selected <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> (1 -propanethiol, diethyl sulphide, and thiophene) with various hydrocarbons (C 6 to C 8) and 2 -ethoxy- 2 -methylpropane (ETBE) under isobaric and isothermal conditions, using a circulation still and the infinite dilutions activity coefficients measurements of 1 -propanethiol, ethyl methyl sulphide, and thiophene in toluene, n-heptane, and 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane at 90  kPa using comparative ebulliometer techniques. The gamma-phi approach {{was used in the}} calculation of VLE. The activity coefficients of the liquid phase (γ) were correlated with the Wilson model. The Wilson model gave a good correlation for all systems. The activity coefficients at infinite dilution (γ∞) were extrapolated from the VLE measurements with the Wilson model. The γ∞ values of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> for the systems thiophene + toluene and thiophene + 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane obtained from the recirculation still measurements are compared with the γ∞ values of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> obtained from the comparative ebulliometer measurements. The agreement between the measurements is good. All the measured γ∞ of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> <b>in</b> hydrocarbons are less than two. 1 -Propanethiol, thiophene, and diethyl sulphide in toluene show nearly ideal behaviour, and thus the γ∞ of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> for these systems are one. The activity coefficients of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> <b>in</b> hydrocarbons show the typical behaviour of positive deviations from Raoult's law, which become smaller with increasing temperature and with {{an increase in the number}} of C-atoms of the alkanes. The systems 1 -propanethiol, thiophene, and diethyl sulphide in toluene show nearly ideal behaviour. No azeotrope formation was observed for the systems thiophene + 1 -hexene and diethyl sulphide + 1 -hexene. The reaction between 1 -propanethiol and 1 -hexene was observed. The systems thiophene + n-hexane and thiophene + 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane, as well as the systems diethyl sulphide + n-heptane and diethyl sulphide + 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane, show positive deviations from Raoult's law. These systems exhibit maximum pressure azeotropy. The systems thiophene + 1 -hexene and thiophene + 2 -ethoxy- 2 -methylpropane, as well as the systems diethyl sulphide with n-hexane, 1 -hexene, cyclohexane, and 2 -ethoxy- 2 -methylpropane, show positive deviation and strong nonideality. No azeotropes formed in these systems. The original UNIFAC predictive model is adequate to describe the behaviour of sulphur in hydrocarbons, even though its application is limited to the availability of the functional group interaction parameters. COSMO-RS gives poor prediction for all the systems studied, and thus it is not currently a suitable model for predicting the behaviour of systems containing <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds.</b> These new consistent measurements can be used to improve and develop thermodynamic models in dilute systems, and thus the behaviour of organic <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> <b>in</b> the distillation of hydrocarbons can be simulated. reviewe...|$|R

40|$|<b>Sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> <b>in</b> <b>sulphur</b> rich food {{have been}} shown to {{significantly}} reduce the risk of cancer development. One such compound is sulforaphane (SF), a cancer chemopreventive agent identified in broccoli (F. cruciferae). In this study, SF content was assessed in extracts of several crucifer vegetables including broccoli, brussels sprout, green cabbage, red cabbage, Chinese kale and turnip, in parallel with anticancer and antioxidant activity. Among tested crucifers, cabbage demonstrated a pronounced anticancer effect against A- 549 lung cancer cells, with an IC 50 value of 38  μg mL− 1, and correlated with high SF levels at 540  μg g− 1. Except for red cabbage and kale, crucifer extracts displayed moderate to weak activity in scavenging 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DDPH) free radicals relative to vitamin E standard...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} C 25 and C 30 highly {{branched}} isoprenoid (HBI) <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> (E. G., thiolanes, 1 -oxo-thiolanes, thiophenes, and benzo[b]thiophenes) with 2, 6, 10, 14 -tetramethyl- 7 -(3 -methylpentyl) pentadecane and 2, 6, 10, 14, 18 -pentamethyl- 7 -(3 -methylpentyl) nonadecane carbon skeletons {{were identified in}} sediments, ranging from Holocene to Upper Cretaceous. These identifications are based on mass spectral characterisation, desulphurisation, and, in some cases, by comparison of mass spectral and relative retention time data with those of authentic standards. The presence of unsaturated C 25 and C 30 HBI thiolanes in a Recent sediment from the Black Sea (age 3 - 6 ka) strongly supports their formation during early diagenesis. The co-occurrence of HBI polyenes (C 25 and C 30) and unsaturated HBI thiolanes (C 25 and C 30) possessing two double bonds less than the corresponding HBI polyenes, in this Recent sediment, testifies {{to the formation of}} unsaturated HBI thiolanes by a reaction of inorganic sulphur species with double bonds of the HBI polyenes. Furthermore, a diagenetic scheme for HBI <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> is proposed based on the identification of HBI <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> <b>in</b> sediment samples with different maturity levels...|$|R
