25|$|The natural {{progression}} was {{to streamline}} the assembly process and the company introduced a method known as Progressive Construction. In this process the mass-produced parts were combined into “unit assemblies”, each {{of which was a}} major <b>sub-component</b> of the finished carriage such as side panels, carriage ends or the roof. The workshops were organised on the “flow-line” principle, similar to a modern assembly line, and the unit assemblies were taken to workstations, where the precision machining of the mass-produced parts ensured they all fitted accurately into position, building into a complete carriage as the unit moved along the flow line. The technique was already in use in Derby prior to grouping, and was adopted in Wolverton during 1925, with Newton Heath following two years later. By using this method, the time taken to construct a typical carriage fell from six weeks to six days and by 1931 Derby and Wolverton were able to handle the entire LMS carriage building workload, and production at Newton Heath ceased.|$|E

40|$|The {{construction}} of specifications {{is often a}} combination of smaller <b>sub-components.</b> Composition and decomposition are techniques that support reuse and allow us to formally combine <b>sub-components</b> through refinement steps while reusing their properties. <b>Sub-components</b> can result from a design or architectural goal and a refinement framework should allow further parallel development over the <b>sub-components.</b> We propose the definition of composition and decomposition in the Event-B formalism following a shared event approach where <b>sub-components</b> interact via synchronisation over shared events and shared states are not allow. We define the necessary proof obligations to ensure a valid composition or decomposition. We also show that shared event composition preserves refinement proofs for <b>sub-components,</b> that is, {{in order to maintain}} refinement of compositions, it is sufficient to prove refinement between corresponding subcomponents.

500|$|The Peoples Republic of China employs several {{forms of}} {{corrections}} {{for people who}} have been arrested, of which re-education through labor was one. [...] The Laogai Research Foundation classifies re-education through labor as a <b>sub-component</b> under the umbrella of the laogai ("reform through labor") criminal justice system, which generally refers to prisons, prison farms, and labor camps for convicted criminals. [...] Re-education through labor, on the other hand, refers to detentions for persons who are not considered criminals or have only committed minor offenses. [...] Persons detained under re-education through labor were detained in facilities which are separate from the general prison system; furthermore, detainees in these re-education facilities receive a small salary, which laogai detainees do not, and in theory have shorter work hours. [...] The laogai system is much larger than the re-education through labor system, with the Laogai Research Foundation identifying 1,045 laogai camps in 2006 (compared to 346 re-education centers). Both systems, however, involve penal labor and often do not allow trials or judicial hearings. [...] The term [...] "reform through labor" [...] or laogai was officially replaced with [...] "prison" [...] in 1994, and the term [...] "re-education center" [...] or láojiàosuǒ (劳教所) was replaced with [...] "correctional center" [...] in 2007.|$|E

40|$|In the {{manufacturing}} industry, many problems pertain to part management, assembly and scheduling. Products today largely {{consist of a}} series of components which themselves can, in turn, consist of more components. The assembly of a product becomes an exercise in assembling all of the <b>sub-components</b> in a timely fashion. Sometimes these <b>sub-components</b> are available in stock, while other times, they must be manufactured using other <b>sub-components.</b> Thus, inventory management of these <b>sub-components</b> becomes crucial in {{the manufacturing}} of products on schedule. This thesis looks at the problem of managing inventory so as to maximize a profit function associated with customer orders whose ordered parts are assembled on time. Because this problem is known to be NP-hard, we propose efficient heuristic methods for this problem. Two of these methods are implemented and tested against each other...|$|R

The empirical analysis is carried out through different empirical specifications and econometric strategies. The benchmark empirical results suggest that improvements in the levels of EF and in the levels of the <b>sub-components</b> of EF lead to increases in FDI inflows. Supplementary empirical results show that EF and the <b>sub-components</b> of EF do not have statistically significant implications for the effect of Domestic Investment (DI) on FDI inflows. Also, they reveal non-linear relationships between EF and FDI inflows, {{as well as between}} the <b>sub-components</b> of EF and FDI inflows. Finally, the empirical analysis shows that the implications of EF for FDI inflows exhibit variations across geo-economic regions...|$|R
