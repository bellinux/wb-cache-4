60|$|But {{there was}} one melancholy part. In the mouth of Loch Aline we found a great <b>sea-going</b> <b>ship</b> at anchor; and this I {{supposed}} at first {{to be one of}} the King's cruisers which were kept along that coast, both summer and winter, to prevent communication with the French. As we got a little nearer, it became plain she was a ship of merchandise; and what still more puzzled me, not only her decks, but the sea-beach also, were quite black with people, and skiffs were continually plying to and fro between them. Yet nearer, and there began to come to our ears a great sound of mourning, the people on board and those on the shore crying and lamenting one to another so as to pierce the heart.|$|E

As they are only placed on board a <b>sea-going</b> <b>ship</b> to go to school and learn the duty of a Lieutenant; and until qualified to act as such, have few or no special functions to attend to; they are little more, while midshipmen, than supernumeraries on board.

60|$|Like all <b>sea-going</b> <b>ship</b> carpenters, {{and more}} {{especially}} those belonging to whaling vessels, he was, {{to a certain}} off-hand, practical extent, alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own; the carpenter's pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all those numerous handicrafts which more or less {{have to do with}} wood as an auxiliary material. But, besides the application to him of the generic remark above, this carpenter of the Pequod was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring in a large ship, upon a three or four years' voyage, in uncivilized and far-distant seas. For not to speak of his readiness in ordinary duties:-- repairing stove boats, sprung spars, reforming the shape of clumsy-bladed oars, inserting bull's eyes in the deck, or new tree-nails in the side planks, and other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special business; he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes, both useful and capricious.|$|E
60|$|Thus, then, {{were these}} two young persons occupied--Gideon attacking the perfect number with resolution; Julia vigorously {{stippling}} incongruous colours on her block, when Providence despatched into these waters a steam-launch asthmatically panting up the Thames. All {{along the banks}} the water swelled and fell, and the reeds rustled. The houseboat itself, that ancient stationary creature, became suddenly imbued with life, and rolled briskly at her moorings, like a <b>sea-going</b> <b>ship</b> when she begins to smell the harbour bar. The wash had nearly died away, and the quick panting of the launch sounded already faint and far off, when Gideon was startled by a cry from Julia. Peering through the window, he beheld her staring disconsolately down stream at the fast-vanishing canoe. The barrister (whatever were his faults) displayed on this occasion a promptitude worthy of his hero, Robert Skill; with one effort of his mind he foresaw {{what was about to}} follow; with one movement of his body he dropped to the floor and crawled under the table.|$|E
50|$|At {{no point}} is the river deep enough to {{accommodate}} <b>sea-going</b> <b>ships,</b> but {{in the second half}} of the 18th century a number of quays were constructed west of Maentwrog from which small vessels took cargoes of timber and, increasingly, slate to be transferred to <b>sea-going</b> <b>ships</b> in deeper water south west of what would become Porthmadog, transferring to Porthmadog itself when its harbour was opened in 1824. The river was and remains so shallow that viable cargoes could only be carried at spring tides. Some of the quays remain to this day, used by anglers. The opening of the Ffestiniog Railway in 1836 dealt a mortal blow to the Dwyryd traffic, which ended completely by 1860.|$|R
50|$|The Gloucester and Berkeley Canal, usually known {{later as}} the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal, was built between 1798 and 1827, to give <b>sea-going</b> <b>ships</b> access to Gloucester. It {{was the first}} ship canal in Great Britain. There was a sea lock at Sharpness, {{on the eastern shore}} of the Severn. By 1870 the canal was {{inadequate}} for the ships of the day, which discharged at Sharpness, and required to bunker. In 1871 work was started on docks at Sharpness, as a convenient place to which larger <b>sea-going</b> <b>shipping</b> could be brought. The Midland Railway was operating the main line between Bristol and Gloucester, and the Midland obtained authorisation for a branch line from Berkeley Road on that line to Sharpness.|$|R

60|$|The {{church at}} Creil was a nondescript {{place in the}} inside, splashed with gaudy lights from the windows, and picked out with medallions of the Dolorous Way. But there was one oddity, {{in the way of}} an ex voto, which pleased me hugely: a {{faithful}} model of a canal boat, swung from the vault, with a written aspiration that God should conduct the Saint Nicolas of Creil to a good haven. The thing was neatly executed, and would have made the delight of a party of boys on the waterside. But what tickled me was the gravity of the peril to be conjured. You might hang up the model of a <b>sea-going</b> <b>ship,</b> and welcome: one that is to plough a furrow round the world, and visit the tropic or the frosty poles, runs dangers that are well worth a candle and a mass. But the Saint Nicolas of Creil, which was to be tugged for some ten years by patient draught-horses, in a weedy canal, with the poplars chattering overhead, and the skipper whistling at the tiller; which was to do all its errands in green inland places, and never get out of sight of a village belfry in all its cruising; why, you would have thought if anything could be done without the intervention of Providence, it would be that! But perhaps the skipper was a humorist: or perhaps a prophet, reminding people of the seriousness of life by this preposterous token.|$|E
60|$|And yet, {{when one}} comes to think upon it calmly, the {{situation}} of these South American citizens forms only a very pale figure {{for the state of}} ordinary mankind. This world itself, travelling blindly and swiftly in over-crowded space, among a million other worlds travelling blindly and swiftly in contrary directions, may very well come by a knock that would set it into explosion like a penny squib. And what, pathologically looked at, is the human body with all its organs, but a mere bagful of petards? The least of these is as dangerous to the whole economy as the ship's powder- magazine to the ship; and with every breath we breathe, and every meal we eat, we are putting one or more of them in peril. If we clung as devotedly as some philosophers pretend we do to the abstract idea of life, or were half as frightened as they make out we are, for the subversive accident that ends it all, the trumpets might sound by the hour and no one would follow them into battle - the blue-peter might fly at the truck, but who would climb into a <b>sea-going</b> <b>ship?</b> Think (if these philosophers were right) with what a preparation of spirit we should affront the daily peril of the dinner-table: a deadlier spot than any battle-field in history, where the far greater proportion of our ancestors have miserably left their bones! What woman would ever be lured into marriage, so much more dangerous than the wildest sea? And what would it be to grow old? For, after a certain distance, every step we take in life we find the ice growing thinner below our feet, and all around us and behind us we see our contemporaries going through. By the time a man gets well into the seventies, his continued existence is a mere miracle, and when he lays his old bones in bed for the night, there is an overwhelming probability that he will never see the day. Do the old men mind it, as a matter of fact? Why, no. They were never merrier; they have their grog at night, and tell the raciest stories; they hear of the death of people about their own age, or even younger, not {{as if it was a}} grisly warning, but with a simple childlike pleasure at having outlived some one else; and when a draught might puff them out like a guttering candle, or a bit of a stumble shatter them like so much glass, their old hearts keep sound and unaffrighted, and they go on, bubbling with laughter, through years of man's age compared to which the valley at Balaklava was as safe and peaceful as a village cricket-green on Sunday. It may fairly be questioned (if we look to the peril only) whether it was a much more daring feat for Curtius to plunge into the gulf, than for any old gentleman of ninety to doff his clothes and clamber into bed.|$|E

5000|$|Lex Claudia (...) {{was a law}} {{established}} in ancient Rome in 218 BC. The law was written by Quintus Claudius, then Tribune of the Plebs, stating that no senator or senator’s son could own a <b>sea-going</b> <b>ship</b> with a capacity of more than 300 amphorae (an amphorae is roughly the equivalent of six gallons, making the total ship capacity equal to about seven tons [...] ). [...] Though Q. Claudius was the only proponent of the law, the law was pushed through the Senate because of the support of Gaius Flaminius Nepos, consul at the time. The law prevented senatorial families from profiting from overseas trade. In Rome, senators were legally prohibited from participating in trade. Gaining wealth through mercantile activities was considered a lower-class activity and those of higher status based their wealth on landholdings, government positions, and profits from war. Regardless of this, senators had found ways of circumventing these laws. [...] Lex Claudia sought to curtail these mercantile profits by senatorial families. As it was introduced right {{before the beginning of}} the second Punic War, it may also have been an attempt by the plebeians and common people of Rome to prevent senators from benefiting financially from overseas wars. [...] The law can be viewed as an attempt to ensure that the senators who made decisions regarding wars did so with the good of the Roman Republic in mind, not their own personal financial interests. This view allows us to understand why Flaminius, though all the senators opposed him, pushed the law through the Senate in order to ensure allegiance to the Roman Republic and strengthen military decision-making. [...] Senators seem to have opposed the law simply because it interfered with their freedom. [...] As a result of the law, senatorial families increased investments in commercial companies and land holding in the Italian peninsula. The law represents one of the first instances of an attempt to separate the governing class from the commercial class in the Roman Republic.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{possibility of}} applying {{the theory of}} semi-Markov processes for probabilistic description of load spectrum for diesel engines employed for ship propulsion, so for main engines. The considerations include output power characteristics {{for this kind of}} engines. The characteristics have enabled formulating a four-member set of states of the process of load on the engines. The theory of semi-Markov processes has been applied for describing the real process of loads on the mentioned engines. This theory has made possible building a model of the engine loads in form of a continuous-time semi-Markov process with a four-state set of values. Properties of a Darboux continuous function, which allow considering the engine loads as the discrete-states and continuous-time processes, have been used to build the model. In consequence a limiting distribution of the occurring process of successive states of engine loads could be determined. The distribution is the probabilities of staying a <b>sea-going</b> <b>ship</b> main engine in successive states of load. The distribution is characterized by the spectrum of loads on this kind of engines. The presented model can be developed by taking into account many states of the process of main engines loading as the need is to make such a probabilistic description of the process that provides possibility of rational control of the operating process...|$|E
40|$|In September 1997, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) {{adopted an}} {{international}} convention protocol to reduce air pollution from ships, {{in order to}} achieve sustainable maritime development. This protocol has been approved by 15 member countries and will be enforced in May 2005. Pollutants emitted from ships, such as nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, sulfur oxides, etc. will be regulated by this convention through ship inspections and issuance of certificates. Ships belonging to maritime countries such as Taiwan, which sail around the world and berth in commercial ports, must obey this convention. This study has investigated possible strategies, which may be adopted by maritime countries to conform to this IMO convention {{in order to reduce the}} air pollution from ships. A <b>sea-going</b> <b>ship</b> must prepare EIAPP and IAPP certificates for inspection by port-state-control officials, when the ship is anchored at a maritime port. These port-state-control officials may also require the continuous detection and sampling of a ship's emissions, while it is berthed at the port. Legislative support is necessary for successful implementation of these safeguards. It is suggested, therefore, that the administration of both navigational and environmental protection, in maritime countries, cooperate in the revision of relevant federal laws, to implement the provisions of the MARPOL 73 / 78 / 97 convention; in this way, the air pollution from ships can be effectively controlled. Installation of advanced detection equipment can effectively detect any ships' violations of air pollution regulations. The Harbor Affairs' Bureau should also establish a database of air pollution inspections for ships berthed within their harbor, requiring that ships' equipment comply with the requirements of the MARPOL convention, for the reduction of air pollution. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
