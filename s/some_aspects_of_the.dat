5|$|Lastly, {{he played}} {{at least some}} part in the {{establishment}} of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, passing the cipher manuscripts from which it was founded to his friend William Wynn Westcott shortly before his death. He had already made a strong case that the mystic and philosophical elements which allowed Freemasonry to evolve from a purely operative to a speculative society were likely to have been imported from <b>some</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hermeticism practised during the Renaissance.|$|E

5|$|The {{scene where}} Lisa gives {{a bottle of}} whiskey to a man on horseback (payment for {{delivering}} a letter) is a reference to Meryl Streep's scene from the film The French Lieutenant's Woman. <b>Some</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> episode are references to the novel Lord of the Flies (a pig's head on a spear, kids using primitive weapons and wearing war paint, and a burning effigy).|$|E
5|$|Although early {{assertions of}} a {{distinct}} Mangalorean Catholic identity {{date from the}} migration period, a developed Mangalorean Catholic cultural identity only emerged following the captivity. The culture of Mangalorean Catholics {{is a blend of}} Mangalorean and Goan cultures. After migration, they adopted <b>some</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local Mangalorean culture, but retained many of their Goan customs and traditions, and like their Goan ancestors, modern Mangalorean Catholic culture can be best described as an increasingly Anglicised Indo-Latin culture. The Mangalorean Catholic diaspora is mostly concentrated in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf and the English-speaking world.|$|E
5|$|At a VCA {{meeting in}} April 1981, Loxton {{announced}} that he was severing all connections with organised cricket. He initially said that he was resigning for family reasons, as he would be moving to the Gold Coast in Queensland with his wife. However, he proceeded to give a blunt 15-minute speech, claiming that he had lost the art of communicating with the players and expressing his disenchantment with <b>some</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game, a reference to the declining player conduct. After relocating to the Gold Coast, he was unable to turn his back on cricket, and umpired matches at local level into his 70s. Although he became severely visually impaired, Loxton still attended matches and asked his companions to describe the proceedings for him; ever opinionated and blunt, he still offered advice to local cricketers.|$|E

5|$|Efe's obverse dies {{show the}} king's name and title, usually spelt {{with a mixture}} of runes and Latin script, with <b>some</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coins {{occasionally}} ill-drawn or omitted altogether. The king's name is generally arranged around the central motif of a pellet (or a cross) within a circle of pellets: this layout probably derived from Northumbrian coins. The reverse dies consisted of a cross and the letters E F E, placed in four sectors that were divided off by lines. It can be shown that Efe did not use his dies in any particular or consistent order. Calculations have been made that suggest that few of his dies remain undiscovered.|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} in 1774, the species has {{been transferred to}} various Boletaceae genera in its taxonomic history, although it retained the original name given to it by German botanist Jacob Christian Schaeffer until a transfer to genus Suillellus in 2014. Several varieties, a subspecies, and a form have been described by European mycologists. Suillellus luridus is mycorrhizal, forming a symbiotic association with deciduous trees such as oak, birch and beech, and {{has been found to}} have a growth-enhancing effect on conifers in experiments. The fruit bodies are highly attractive to, and often infested by, insects, and several species of fly have been recorded feeding on them. Chemical analyses have revealed <b>some</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mushroom's components, including its volatile flavour compounds, its fatty acid and amino acid compositions, and the identities of the carotenoid compounds responsible for its colour.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{recruited}} John Jay and James Madison {{to write}} a series of essays defending the proposed Constitution, now known as The Federalist Papers, and made the largest contribution to that effort, writing 51 of 85 essays published (Madison wrote 29, Jay only five). Hamilton supervised the entire project, enlisted the participants, wrote {{the majority of the}} essays, and oversaw the publication. During the project each person was responsible for their areas of expertise. Jay covered foreign relations, Madison covered the history of republics and confederacies, along with the anatomy of the new government and Hamilton covered the branches of government most pertinent to him: the executive and judicial branches, with <b>some</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Senate, as well as covering military matters and taxation The papers first appeared in The Independent Journal on October 27, 1787.|$|E

5|$|PÃ©ron's {{interview}} describes <b>some</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> behaviour of the King Island emu. He {{writes that}} the bird was generally solitary but gathered in flocks of ten to twenty at breeding time, then wandered off in pairs. They ate berries, grass and seaweed, and foraged mainly during morning and evening. They were swift runners, but were apparently slower than the mainland birds, due to being fat. They swam well, but only did so when necessary. They reportedly liked the shade of lagoons and the shoreline, rather than open areas. They used a claw on each wing for scratching themselves. If unable to flee from the hunting dogs of the sealers, they would defend themselves by kicking, which could inflict {{a great deal of}} harm.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{mysteries of}} Isis and of other mystery cults, {{particularly}} their {{connection with the}} afterlife, resemble important elements of Christianity. The {{question of whether the}} mysteries influenced Christianity is controversial and the evidence is unclear; some scholars today attribute the similarities to a shared cultural background rather than direct influence. In contrast, Apuleius's account has had direct effects in modern times. Through his description of them, the mysteries of Isis have influenced many works of fiction and modern fraternal organizations, as well as a widespread, though false, belief that the ancient Egyptians themselves had an elaborate system of mystery initiations.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} Master Apartments' opening, the {{building}} and the institute both experienced monetary deficits, with the building going into foreclosure in 1932. Two years later, Horch had his tax-exempt corporation, Master Institute of United Arts, Inc., become the building's landlord, with receivership ending the next year in 1935. Soon after, the Horch and Roerich families dissolved their partnership due to disagreements, and the Roeriches unsuccessfully sued Horch to regain control of the Master Apartments. Horch then closed the Roeriches' museum, forcing it to find a new location, and replaced it with the Riverside Museum. Louis Horch's wife Nettie also controlled <b>some</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building and its organizations during this time, but by 1958, the Horches' son Frank became the building's manager.|$|E

5|$|The Kclass proved {{successful}} on well-maintained track. It {{was capable}} of high speeds on express passenger duties, although their use was limited by the lower storage capacity of tank locomotives, which meant the Kand K1classes were prone to water shortages on the long Kent Coast routes, and precluded them from working many of the former London and South Western Railway (LSWR) routes west of London. The need to save weight meant that compromises were made in <b>some</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> design. The boiler size was constrained by the SECRâs axle-loading restrictions, {{with the result that}} the designâs full steaming potential was not realised. The failure to capitalise upon a larger boiler would also affect Maunsellâs subsequent 2-6-0 classes, as they were given the same boiler despite their lower axle-loadings.|$|E
5|$|The forelimbs of Plesiorycteropus show specializations for scratch-digging, {{in which}} the forefeet are placed against the substrate, the claws are entered into the substrate, and the forefeet are then drawn back against the body. Other {{parts of the body}} also show such specializations, {{including}} large hindlimbs and a broad tail. <b>Some</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vertebral column and the pelvis suggest that the animal often assumed an erect, or sitting, posture. The animal may also have been capable of climbing, perhaps {{in a manner similar to}} gymnures and shrew tenrecs, which are small-eyed like Plesiorycteropus. It was probably myrmecophagous, eating insects such as ants and termites, but may also have eaten other soft food, and because of its small size probably did not forage in termite mounds, as the aardvark does.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{idea for}} the game was {{inspired}} by , a 2007 video game which members of both companies were playing at the time. The game was proposed to Square Enix half-jokingly by PopCap's chief creative officer Jason Kapalka during a meeting between the two companies in 2007, and was released on the Xbox Live Arcade and on the Steam platform for Windows PCs by Square Enix on November 18, 2009. Gyromancer received a generally positive reception from reviewers. Critics took issue with perceived limited graphics, <b>some</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> music, and a weak and confusing plot. Despite these flaws, in general they found the game to be fun and addictive, {{and to have a}} great deal of replay value.|$|E
