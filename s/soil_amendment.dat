25|$|In Sweden, farmers use dried peat {{to absorb}} {{excrement}} from cattle that are wintered indoors. The most important property of peat is retaining moisture in container soil {{when it is}} dry while preventing the excess of water from killing roots when it is wet. Peat can store nutrients {{although it is not}} fertile itself– it is polyelectrolytic with a high ion-exchange capacity due to its oxidized lignin. Peat is discouraged as a <b>soil</b> <b>amendment</b> by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, England, since 2003. While bark-based peat-free potting soil mixes are on the rise, particularly in the U.K., peat remains an important raw material for horticulture in Canada, as well as parts of the United States. However, it is recommended to treat peat thermally, e.g., through soil steaming in order to kill pests and reactivate nutrients.|$|E
25|$|Maize is a {{major source}} of both grain feed and fodder for {{livestock}}. It is fed to the livestock in various ways. When it is used as a grain crop, the dried kernels are used as feed. They are often kept on the cob for storage in a corn crib, or they may be shelled off for storage in a grain bin. The farm that consumes the feed may produce it, purchase it on the market, or some of both. When the grain is used for feed, the rest of the plant (the corn stover) can be used later as fodder, bedding (litter), or <b>soil</b> <b>amendment.</b> When the whole maize plant (grain plus stalks and leaves) is used for fodder, it is usually chopped all at once and ensilaged, as digestibility and palatability are higher in the ensilaged form than in the dried form. Maize silage {{is one of the most}} valuable forages for ruminants. Before the advent of widespread ensilaging, it was traditional to gather the corn into shocks after harvesting, where it dried further. With or without a subsequent move to the cover of a barn, it was then stored for weeks to several months until fed to the livestock. Today ensilaging can occur not only in siloes but also in silage wrappers. However, in the tropics maize can be harvested year-round and fed as green forage to the animals.|$|E

This study was carried out at the Naphok and Veunkham villages, Lao PDR,to evaluate the yield response of a maize mono-cropping system to <b>soil</b> <b>amendments</b> and analyze the economic return of such interventions. The amendments were rice husk biochar, bentonite clay, compost, clay-manure compost, and rice husk biochar compost, in isolation and in various combinations. Over a period of two cropping seasons (2011 - 2012),the enhancement of maize yield due to <b>soil</b> <b>amendments</b> ranged from 0. 77 to 3. 79 tha- 1 at Naphok and from 1. 21 to 5. 14 tha- 1 at Veunkham, resulting in net revenues ranging from - 794 to 841 and - 331 to 1391 US$ha- 1, respectively. Soils amended with low-cost amendments such as compost, rice husk biochar, rice husk biochar compost, and clay-manure compost were economically viable within the first cropping season. In contrast, soils amended with higher-cost amendments such as bentonite clay requires up to five years to be economically viable.

40|$|Abstract. Soil {{salinization}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} land degradation types and has greatly influenced sustainable agricultural development. Interest is growing in the use of <b>soil</b> <b>amendments</b> to reclaim saline and sodic soils. According to the practical soil conditions in the Yellow River Delta and the special characteristics of the coastal saline soil, in order to find the effects of combined applications of desulfurization gypsum, humic acid and polyacrylamide on saline-alkali soil, pot experiment was conducted to analyze the chemical properties and plant yields. L 8 (2 7) design was selected to engage in orthogonal experiment with first class interaction of three factors at two levels. The results demonstrated that applying <b>soil</b> <b>amendments</b> significantly increase the total salt content, decreased the soil pH and SAR. The effect on treatment 8 (30 g/kg desulfurization gypsum, 2 g / kg of humic acid, 0. 025 g/kg PAM) was the most significant, cotton soil pH and SAR decreased to 7. 63 and 7. 22, corn soil pH and SAR decreased to 7. 57 and 7. 34. The effects of <b>soil</b> <b>amendments</b> on crop growth showed that the treatment 7, combination of <b>soil</b> <b>amendments</b> (30 g/kg desulfurization gypsum, 2 g / kg of humic acid, 0. 01 g/kg PAM) could promote the growth of cotton most significantly.

Therefore, the problems from fresh waste disposals in this area are recognized as one of environmental significant concerns. In order to manage this problem, the conversion of those possible agricultural waste disposals to biochar <b>soil</b> <b>amendments</b> is studied. In this work, some parts of agricultural fruits waste are durian peel, mangosteen rind, corncob and banana peel. In addition, waste from fresh shrimp, shrimp shell, is also studied. Those previous waste materials are processed by viapyrolysis method to form biochar. The studies of chemical compositions, such as major and some minor nutrition, are analyzed using the Kjeldahl technique, UV-Visible spectrophotometer and Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) spectrometer. The heat of combustion and some chemical properties are also studied. The biochar derived from corncob, per gram, dominates the highest value of the heat of combustion (75. 151 Kcal).
