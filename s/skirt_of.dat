5|$|A {{thorough}} technical investigation {{including a}} pigment analysis of Las Meninas was conducted around 1981 in Museo Prado. The analysis revealed the usual pigments of the baroque period frequently used by Velázquez {{in his other}} paintings. The main pigments used for this painting were lead white, azurite (for the <b>skirt</b> <b>of</b> the kneeling menina), vermilion and red lake, ochres and carbon blacks.|$|E
5|$|Insects, {{including}} beetles, moths, wasps and flies, use the bark, {{leaves and}} flowers {{of the tree}} in various ways. Some feed or hide camouflaged in the <b>skirt</b> <b>of</b> dead leaves, a favourite dry place for weta to hide in winter. Many of the insect companions of C.australis have followed it into the domesticated surroundings of parks and home gardens. If the leaves are left to decay, the soil underneath cabbage trees becomes a black humus that supports a rich array of amphipods, earthworms and millipedes.|$|E
5|$|In September 1954, Monroe began filming Billy Wilder's comedy The Seven Year Itch, {{in which}} she starred {{opposite}} Tom Ewell {{as a woman who}} becomes the object of her married neighbor's sexual fantasies. Although the film was shot in Hollywood, the studio decided to generate advance publicity by staging the filming of a scene on Lexington Avenue in New York. In the shoot, Monroe is standing on a subway grate with the air blowing up the <b>skirt</b> <b>of</b> her white dress, which {{became one of the most}} famous scenes of her career. The shoot lasted for several hours and attracted a crowd of nearly 2,000 spectators, including professional photographers.|$|E

5|$|The {{mail pouch}} was a {{separate}} component to the saddle {{that made the}} Pony Express unique. Standard mail pouches for horses were never employed because of their size and shape, as it was time consuming detaching and attaching it from one saddle to the other, causing undue delay in changing mounts. With many stops to make, the delayed time at each station would accumulate to appreciable proportions. To get around this difficulty, a mochila, or covering of leather, was thrown over the saddle. The saddle horn and cantle projected through holes which were specially cut to size in the mochila. Attached to the broad leather <b>skirt</b> <b>of</b> the mochila were four cantinas, or box-shaped hard leather compartments, where letters were carried on the journey.|$|E
5|$|There {{are nine}} species of insect only found on C.australis, {{of which the}} best known is Epiphryne verriculata, the cabbage tree moth, which is {{perfectly}} adapted to hide on a dead leaf. Its caterpillars eat large holes and wedges in the leaves. The moth lays its eggs {{at the base of}} the central spike of unopened leaves. The caterpillars eat holes in the surface of the leaves and leave characteristic notches in the leaf margins. They can infest young trees but seldom damage older trees, which lack the <b>skirt</b> <b>of</b> dead leaves where the parent moths like to hide.|$|E

The mother of Quetzalcoatl was the Aztec goddess Coatlicue ("the {{one with the}} <b>skirt</b> <b>of</b> serpents"), also known as Cihuacoatl ("The Lady of the serpent"). Quetzalcoatl's father was Mixcoatl ("Cloud Serpent"). He was identified with the Milky Way, {{the stars and the}} heavens in several Mesoamerican cultures.|$|E
25|$|The Outer Terai ends at {{the base}} of the first range of foothills called the Siwaliks or Churia. This range has a densely forested <b>skirt</b> <b>of</b> coarse {{alluvium}} called the bhabhar. Below the bhabhar, finer, less permeable sediments force groundwater to the surface in a zone of springs and marshes. In Persian, terai refers to wet or marshy ground. Before the use of DDT this was dangerously malarial. Nepal's rulers used this for a defensive frontier called the char kose jhadi (four kos forest, one kos equalling about three kilometers or two miles).|$|E
25|$|The pneumofathometer line on {{a surface}} {{supplied}} umbilical {{is a valuable}} backup supply in case of damage to the main supply hose, or if a diver needs to supply air to another diver on surface supply, as the usual configurations of helmet and full face mask do not allow buddy breathing of the conventional kind. The Pneumo line can be tucked into the neck dam or under the <b>skirt</b> <b>of</b> a full face mask, and provided the helmet or mask is not leaking heavily, will supply adequate air for an assisted ascent.|$|E

25|$|It is {{said that}} this Haka was {{composed}} by Te Rauparaha of Ngāti Toa to commemorate his escape from death during an incident in 1810. Chased by his enemies, he hid in a food-storage pit under the <b>skirt</b> <b>of</b> a woman. He climbed out to find someone standing over him, who, instead of killing Te Rauparaha, {{turned out to be}} another chief friendly to him. In relief, Te Rauparaha performed this ancient haka, which had been performed all through Aotearoa for centuries. The story of Te Rauparaha was merely woven into several older stories about this haka.|$|E

The royal gift was forgotten— the ample <b>skirt</b> <b>of</b> the coat within which it had been packed, and which he had {{hitherto}} held cautiously in front of his person, slipped back to its more usual position— he sat down beside Crabbe, and the glass was crushed to atoms. His scream and gesture made his wife conclude that he had sat down on a pair of scissors, or the like: but very little harm had been done except the breaking of the glass.|$|E

It also displays many family photographs and documents as well as her Legion of Honour medal. Most rooms are open for the public to walk through including bedrooms with the cots where her children slept, a huge kitchen, and a dining room where she often entertained large groups. The bathrooms were designed in art deco style but most rooms retained the French chateau style.|$|E

25|$|Indian Mesa is a {{flat top}} hill whose sides are steep cliffs. Indian Mesa is {{located within the}} Lake Pleasant Regional Park grounds by the shores of Lake Pleasant and Agua Fria River in the Bradshaw Mountain Range. Lake Pleasant Regional Park is within the {{municipal}} boundaries of Peoria, Arizona. On top of the mesa there are ruins of a prehistoric Hohokam village which is monitored by the Arizona Site Stewards and considered an important archaeological site by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. There is a small, steep and narrow path which begins at the <b>skirt</b> <b>of</b> the hill and leads {{to the top of}} the mesa.|$|E
25|$|The {{album cover}} is an {{illustration}} (in pencil) by artist Nick Price, {{who had also}} designed the cover for the programme for her 1979 tour. Bush {{was pleased with the}} results (it depicts a multitude of animals and monsters emerging from under her <b>skirt).</b> <b>Of</b> the concept, Bush said that it reflects the title, depicting good and bad things that emerge from you. The album was released on compact disc in Japan in 1987 with the cover art modified. A section of the original cover art was enlarged, creating two different booklet covers: the outer one modified; and underneath the original. The album's cover was voted 'Greatest Album Cover of 1980' by Record Mirror.|$|E
25|$|Two uniforms were {{prescribed}} {{for women in}} the USNRF. A winter uniform of navy blue serge alternated with a summer uniform of white drill. Both consisted of a single-breasted Norfolk style coat with gilt buttons and a rating badge on the left sleeve, worn over a <b>skirt</b> <b>of</b> the same fabric and shirt waist. The coat had patch pockets on each hip and a belt. The skirt was hemmed to four inches above the ankle, and the shirt waist was designed to be worn either open at the neck or buttoned. Hats were to be flat-brimmed sailor hats of navy blue felt or straw. Shoes, hose, gloves and a standard Navy neckerchief completed the outfit. Capes were also {{prescribed for}} cold weather.|$|E

25|$|Above {{the wooded}} valley of Eskdale {{there is a}} <b>skirt</b> <b>of</b> crags before the open moor is reached. Over this edge tumble the waterfalls of Stanley Force and Birker Force, the former easily reached by made paths from the road. The farmers of Eskdale once {{extracted}} peat from the plateau {{and the remains of}} graded paths and peat huts can still be found on the fellside. On this flank the remains of Gate Gill iron mine can also be found. Haematite was won from a number of levels here in the 1880s. The Duddon flanks have shallower gradients, divided by dry stone walls into long strips of pasture land. This rough grazing supports a series of farms along the valley between Ulpha and Seathwaite.|$|E
25|$|A {{large-scale}} Capitol dome restoration project, {{the first}} extensive such work since 1959–1960, began in 2014, with completion scheduled before the 2017 presidential inauguration. As of 2012, $20 million in {{work around the}} <b>skirt</b> <b>of</b> the dome had been completed, but other deterioration, including at least 1,300 cracks in the brittle iron {{that have led to}} rusting and seepage inside, needed to be addressed. Before the August 2012 recess, the Senate Appropriations Committee voted to spend $61 million to repair the exterior of the dome. The House wanted to spend less on government operations, but in late 2013, it was announced that renovations would take place over two years, starting in spring 2014. Extensive scaffolding was erected in 2014, enclosing and obscuring the dome. All exterior scaffolding was removed by mid-September 2016.|$|E
25|$|The SR.N1 was {{powered by}} a single piston engine, driven by {{expelled}} air. Demonstrated at the Farnborough Airshow in 1960, it was shown that this simple craft could carry a load of up to 12 marines with their equipment {{as well as the}} pilot and co-pilot with only a slight reduction in hover height proportional to the load carried. The SR.N1 did not have any skirt, using instead the peripheral air principle that Christopher had patented. It was later found that the craft's hover height was improved by the addition of a <b>skirt</b> <b>of</b> flexible fabric or rubber around the hovering surface to contain the air. The skirt was an independent invention made by a Royal Navy officer, C.H. Latimer-Needham, who sold his idea to Westland (by then the parent of Saunders-Roe's helicopter and hovercraft interests), and who worked with Christopher to develop the idea further.|$|E
