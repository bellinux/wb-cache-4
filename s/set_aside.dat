40|$|In this paper, {{the author}} {{considers}} {{the arguments for}} introducing new solutions in the present Arbitration Act of Serbia (2006) with regard to proceedings for <b>setting</b> <b>aside</b> of an arbitral award. It explains the main reasons {{that lead to the}} current situation where jurisdiction for <b>setting</b> <b>aside</b> is largely regulated by provisions of other statutes rather than the Arbitration Act. The current legislative framework indirectly provides for two, and possibly three instances of judicial review of an arbitral award. The author challenges the belief that the right to effective legal remedy provided in the Constitution and the Convention on the Protection of Human Rights requires the existence of the right of appeal against the first instance decision on the request for <b>setting</b> <b>aside.</b> She draws attention to advantages of conferring jurisdiction for <b>setting</b> <b>aside</b> to the highest court of the country. The proposed provisions {{should be included in the}} Arbitration Act rather then left to other statutes. Such legislative change will be conducive to uniformity of decision and will enhance development of domestic arbitration...|$|R
