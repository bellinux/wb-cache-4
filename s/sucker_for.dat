500|$|Not all reviews were negative; Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad wrote: [...] "I'm a <b>sucker</b> <b>for</b> Christmas episodes." [...] He was {{complimentary}} towards Stritch's role as Jack's mother, citing {{that she}} has been [...] "demanding and a little difficult, but she also makes you really feel for her." ...|$|E
500|$|Lynch {{described}} {{the attractiveness of}} the idea of a pilot, despite the knowledge that the medium of television would be constricting: [...] "I'm a <b>sucker</b> <b>for</b> a continuing story... Theoretically, you can get a very deep story and you can go so deep and open the world so beautifully, but it takes time to do that." [...] The story included normal and surreal elements, much like Lynch's earlier series Twin Peaks. Groundwork was laid for story arcs, such as the mystery of Rita's identity, Betty's career and Adam Kesher's film project.|$|E
500|$|... "The Master Plan" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Matt Fowler of IGN {{said the}} budget problems created strong character development potential for Leslie and comedic opportunities for Ron. Fowler also enjoyed that the normally-dissolute Tom formed an authentic romantic connection, and said Chris Pratt brought [...] "a certain naturalness" [...] to {{a role that}} could otherwise have been overly idiotic. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club strongly praised the episode, praising Rob Lowe and the entire regular cast. He declared Parks and Recreation the best television show since Arrested Development, and said, [...] "As much as I like the '50 jokes a minute' style of comedies ... I'm a <b>sucker</b> <b>for</b> a show where the characters are as well-wrought and as purely funny as they are on this show." [...] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall praised {{the implementation of the}} new characters, particularly the fact that the script did not rely too heavily on them. Sepinwall also said the episode balanced well the workplace humor with the romantic subplots between Leslie and Ben, April and Andy, and Ann and Chris.|$|E

When using vegetative parts such as <b>suckers</b> <b>for</b> propagation, {{there is a risk}} of transmitting diseases (especially the devastating Panama disease).|$|R
500|$|Nando Di Fino of Mediaite also {{complained that}} the episode may have gone too far, and {{compared}} it to previous episodes in the series that had been banned from airing on television, noting, [...] "The show has dipped into sensitive material before, and Fox has actually refused to air two episodes — one dealing with abortion, the other with heavy Jewish themes. Sunday night's episode, if reaction to {{it can be used}} as a good measure, may have been better joining those two episodes in exile." [...] Whitney Jefferson of Jezebel, a website centered on women's issues, also strongly criticized the episode for its storyline involving Brenda and her boyfriend, Jeff: [...] "Personally, I'm way beyond being offended by the show — I've long been numbed to shock-value offensiveness — and had stopped watching years ago anyhow. But being a <b>sucker</b> <b>for</b> a Halloween-themed episodes, I tuned in to Fox's [...] "Animation Domination" [...] comedy block last night. What I saw was seriously awful." [...] Jefferson ended her review of the episode by stating that the show was [...] "Definitely the scariest Halloween special we've ever seen." ...|$|E
500|$|Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph {{felt it was}} [...] "a great opening track" [...] for Beyoncé and lauded its [...] "anthemic" [...] chorus. Mesfin Fekadu of the Associated Press {{deemed the}} song [...] "a supreme way" [...] to open the album. musicOMH's Philip Matusavage wrote that [...] "Pretty Hurts" [...] {{manifested}} Beyoncé as a [...] "definitive personal statement rather than just another Beyoncé album". The Guardian reviewer Michael Cragg listed the track as an [...] "immediate" [...] single choice on the album. Julia Leconte of Now opined that the song was [...] "classic Beyoncé feminism" [...] and quipped, [...] "and if you're a <b>sucker</b> <b>for</b> girl-power hits like 'Irreplaceable', you'll have this one on repeat, too". While Claire Lobenfield of Complex stated, [...] "What sounds like a classic Beyoncé female empowerment ballad cuts even deeper." [...] Tim Finney of the same publication deemed the song a [...] "heavy-handed future concert staple". Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Mikael Wood felt that with [...] "Pretty Hurts," [...] Beyoncé created [...] "razzle-dazzle pop out of small-scale sentiments that might've seemed on paper like fodder for hushed ballads". [...] Drowned in Sound writer Robert Leedham stated the track was [...] "impeccably sung".|$|E
500|$|... "Chinga" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Anna Redman of HELLO! Canada was positive toward the episode, {{and referred to}} it as [...] "one of the series' best episodes". Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club gave a mixed review, awarded it a C–, and called it an episode that [...] "seems like one of those ideas that sounds really, really great until someone thinks about for more than a minute." [...] Handlen argued that King was a wrong fit for The X-Files and that the resultant script was King [...] "being asked to marry his voice to Carter's". He derided the plot and wrote that it was written [...] "like someone (Darin Morgan, only not funny at all) doing a parody for the most familiar King tropes." [...] Handlen, however, did praise the violence in the episode, noting that he is [...] "a <b>sucker</b> <b>for</b> gore", but ultimately called the episode [...] "lousy". John Keegan from Critical Myth heavily criticized the episode's writing and gave it a 4 out of 10. he wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode is quite a disappointment, considering that Stephen King would appear to be an obvious match for a series like this. Unfortunately, the final script doesn’t seem to be a true horror story or the whimsical character study that it clearly wants to be, and so it fails to satisfy on either account. There are some great character moments, but it’s not enough to save the episode." ...|$|E

500|$|Although the {{characters}} were separated on screen, they had gained a fan {{base on the}} Internet that believed Martha should be with Jack and wanted the pair to reunite. Gordon herself backed the pairing, stating that she believed they should be together. She said: [...] "I actually love Jack and Martha together, I'm a <b>sucker</b> <b>for</b> romance so, I want {{want them to be}} together [...] I want them to continue on, [...] the timing is not right, they are not mature enough. Jack's in a relationship with someone else as Martha is, there just seems to be things {{getting in the way of}} them getting back together all the time." [...] Gordon also hoped for a happy ending for the two characters if they were to ever leave the serial adding: [...] "If I had it my way, and I got to write the scripts then I'd make it happily ever after, Martha and Jack riding off into the sunset." [...] Gordon has spoken of her understanding from the audiences point of view, that together Jack and Martha are [...] "the ultimate couple". She also reiterated her belief that it would be to tough at the time of Martha's downward spiral for them to work together, but if Martha is to get through her troubles and have a happy ending, that it would be with Jack. The Daily Telegraph commented on the Martha and Jack situation, saying it is played out in a [...] "classic soapie technique". They said [...] "Bring {{the characters}} together, push them apart, but always leave open the possibility that they could get back together. It has worked for Days of Our Lives John Black and Marlena Evans".|$|E
500|$|Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly was {{generally}} positive {{on most of}} the songs featured in the episode. She gave the performance of [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] a [...] "B", and explained that [...] "This one took a little time to grow on me. I liked it better on the show than when I heard it by itself, which is weird because it's exactly the same thing. Goes to show how much of a difference a good performance [...] makes." [...] Gonzalez gave the highest grade to the cover versions of [...] "Misery" [...] and [...] "Raise Your Glass", both performed by the Dalton Academy Warblers. In her review for [...] "Misery", she praised the performance, and gave it an [...] "A". She opined, [...] "I'm a <b>sucker</b> <b>for</b> a Warbler-ized pop song, especially when it makes Blaine dance and make his weird, animated faces. They're simply adorable, and these Warblers are simply amazing." [...] Gonzalez gave the performance of [...] "Raise Your Glass" [...] an [...] "A". The lowest grade given by Gonzalez was a [...] "D" [...] for Santana's performance of [...] "Trouty Mouth". She explained [...] "If we're taking this song as a joke, it gets a 'B−' because Santana sounded great. But [...] I think about how bad I felt for Sam watching his utter mortification." [...] "Candles" [...] {{was generally}} well received by Gonzalez. She gave the performance a [...] "B" [...] and went on to write [...] "It’s really hard for this pair {{to live up to the}} awesomeness of 'Baby, It's Cold Outside'. I'm sure they could one day, but this one fell a bit short for me musically. [...] In the context of the show, however, it was a great moment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Long {{involved}} in liberal politics, Garfield {{was caught up}} in the communist scare of the late 1940s and early 1950s. He supported the Committee for the First Amendment, which opposed governmental investigation of political beliefs. When called to testify before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, which was empowered to investigate communist infiltration in America, Garfield refused to name communist party members or followers, testifying that, indeed, he knew none in the film industry. Garfield rejected communism, and just prior to his death in hopes of redeeming himself {{in the eyes of the}} blacklisters, wrote that he had been duped by communist ideology in an unpublished article called [...] "I Was a <b>Sucker</b> <b>for</b> a Left Hook", a reference to Garfield's movies about boxing. However, his forced testimony before the committee had severely damaged his reputation. He was blacklisted in Red Channels, and barred from future employment as an actor by Hollywood movie studio bosses for the remainder of his career.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1980s and early 1990s, the Warner Valley {{experienced}} an extended drought, reducing {{the water in}} Hart Lake to a dangerously low level.

2500|$|... "Ain't it Funny (Murder Remix)" [...] is {{a hip-hop}} song with a {{duration}} of three minutes and forty-nine seconds (3:49). It is thematically dissimilar to the original track.

2500|$|The {{official}} poster featured D'Arcy carrying Riseborough on {{his back}} in a romantic pose.

[...] A second poster was also released, which again featured Riseborough and D'Arcy as Wallis and Edward, about to kiss on a beach. Written on the top left of the poster is the following line: [...] "One of the greatest love stories of all time, the king who gave up his throne for the woman he loved." [...] Throughout January 2012, Madonna appeared on two different television shows and talked about the film.
