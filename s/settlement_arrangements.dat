50|$|A Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) is Ireland's debt {{management}} solution {{for individuals who}} want to avoid outright bankruptcy and declare insolvency. The agreement {{is one of the}} three alternatives authorized under Ireland's Personal Insolvency Act 2012; Debt <b>Settlement</b> <b>Arrangements</b> (DSA) and Debt Relief Notices (DRN) make the other two arrangements. PIA mandates a legal agreement between a debtor and their creditors, which is mediated and administered by a Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP). A PIA usually lasts for a term of six years and must include both unsecured debt and secured debts.|$|E

By considering the evolution of interbank <b>settlement</b> <b>arrangements</b> and central banking functions {{in the context of a}} number of diverse historical country case studies, this paper seeks to improve understanding of the development of, and reasons for, central banks’ current roles. Starting from a situation where the earliest banks gradually began to accept claims on each other, banks introduced a variety of innovations to clear and settle between themselves more efficiently.

This area was again subdivided into four husbandlands, each of 26 acre. Each husbandland could provide two oxen and eight oxen were need for a plough-team. This arrangement led to small farm towns being established with accommodation for at least four men in six to eight houses, taking practical considerations into account. Another similar 'ferm toun' also existed at Bloak, near Auchentiber, until the 1890s.|$|R

By modeling the trading economy that generates the demand for payment services, we are able to show some largely unexplored advantages of net settlement. We find that net settlement can prevent certain gridlock situations, which may arise in gross settlement in the absence of delivery versus payment requirements. In addition, we show that net settlement can economize on collateral requirements and avoid trading delays...|$|E

A spectrum of risk-control arrangements and procedures at the clearing stage of a transaction provide further benefits. The recent and current development of clearing and settlement practices exemplifies the re-engineering and continuous-improvement approaches that have been of proven value throughout the economy, and that particularly have facilitated the advantageous adoption of new technologies. The resulting strength and flexibility of current practices have contributed to financial markets' responsiveness to three major challenges and opportunities: the invention of financial derivatives (e. g., futures, options and swaps) {{and the establishment of}} exchanges to trade many of them; the availability of computing and telecommunication technology that can simultaneously link a large, geographically dispersed group of traders, and the consequent feasibility of conducting trading by means other than open outcry on a trading floor; and the explosive growth of transaction volume on a number of exchanges. * Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.

40|$|Based on {{observations}} of court trials and extensive interviews with judges, {{this article explores}} how judicial mediation in China undermines {{the rights of the}} battered women in divorce cases. We find that even if the judges are able to establish that domestic violence is committed, it is often erased in the stage of judicial mediation. This is because judicial mediation inevitably focuses on <b>settlement</b> <b>arrangements.</b> Lingering reference to domestic abuse would simply invite new denials or refutations from the abuser. It thus risks ruining the mediation efforts made by the judge. Our findings raise important questions with regard to the compulsory practice of mediation in family cases in China.

The LVTS is a real-time electronic system for handling large-value payments {{and is an}} integral component of the country’s financial system. Each day, approximately Can$ 140 billion in payments is sent through the LVTS, including payments used to settle other important clearing and settlement systems in Canada. The paper explains how {{the design of the}} LVTS, including its risk-control framework, collateral arrangements, and loss-allocation procedures in the event of participant default, exceeds the risk-containment requirements of the international Core Principles for Systemically Important Payments Systems. At the same time, the LVTS offers a more cost-efficient means of sending payments relative to standard Real-time Gross <b>Settlement</b> <b>arrangements.</b> This is facilitated by the availability of several liquidity-saving features, each of which is described.

40|$|The {{significant}} {{progress on the}} unification of cross-border securities trading infrastructure within the European Union (EU) has been paving the road to an integrated EU financial market. However, more dynamic changes towards integration are happening a level below, namely at the clearing and <b>settlement</b> <b>arrangements.</b> Financial liberalization, the information technologies development, progress in the common regulatory framework across the European Union {{and the introduction of}} the euro are examples of the several driving forces which have also been influencing in this process. The importance of an efficient securities clearing and settlement system lies on the safer transfer of ownership of assets against payment. Such a system must be developed in a way to minimize the risks involved on securities transactions, and it must still offer lower costs, which do not hinder the intention to acquire or dispose securities. Financial integration in Europe is still far from being achieved and it is not a common currency alone that may change this scenario.
