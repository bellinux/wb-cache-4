500|$|Much of Ianto's {{character}} development is centred on the character's relationship with Captain Jack. On the character's evolution from minor character to romantic interest, Gareth David-Lloyd has commented that [...] "To have a storyline where you're {{involved with the}} leading character for any actor is awesome." [...] On the character's development, David-Lloyd has said that through Jack's relationship, [...] "he's found his meaning and ... he's happier." [...] Asked {{what it is that}} Ianto receives from Jack, David-Lloyd responds [...] "Support, meaning. I think he lost meaning. He was tortured and Jack gave him that meaning back. And reliability that he'll always be there, I think." [...] John Barrowman and Gareth David-Lloyd have also opined that Jack's relationship with Ianto has however brought out Jack's empathy, and helped to ground him, with John Barrowman reported as saying that Ianto [...] "brings out the 'human' in him, it brings out more of the empathy because he's actually fallen for someone and he really cares about somebody. So, it's really great and I think that's what makes him warm to other people. It makes him more approachable." [...] In the same interview, Gareth David-Lloyd said of the relationship and his character that [...] "I think Ianto's always made him care and that is really the heart of the show. Ianto's always bearing his emotional side and vulnerable side and keeping his feet on the ground. I think of all the characters, he's the one who tries to keep everyone else's feet on the ground. He brings everyone back to reality, often with a dry, witty remark or taking a dig at <b>somebody</b> <b>just</b> to sort of bring people back down." ...|$|E
2500|$|At 7:36p.m. on September 16, 2016, police {{received}} a 9-1-1 call about an abandoned {{vehicle in the}} middle of 36th Street North just west of Lewis Avenue. One caller said: [...] "Somebody left their vehicle running {{in the middle of}} the street with the doors wide open." [...] "The doors are open. [...] The vehicle is still running. It's an SUV. It's like {{in the middle of the}} street. It's blocking traffic." [...] "There was a guy running from it, saying it was going to blow up. But I think he's smoking something. I got out and was like, 'Do you need help?'" [...] "He was like, 'Come here, come here, I think it's going to blow up.'" [...] The other caller said: [...] "There is a car that looks like <b>somebody</b> <b>just</b> jumped out of it and left it in the center of the road on 36th Street North and North Lewis Avenue." [...] "It's dead in the middle of the street." [...] "It's a Navigator. The driver-side door is open like somebody jumped out. It's on the yellow line, blocking traffic. Nobody in the car." ...|$|E
2500|$|With its {{humor and}} {{occasional}} tongue-in-cheek tone, Passions {{has been known}} to [...] "break the fourth wall", or somehow call {{attention to the fact that}} the show is fictional. In an early episode, Kay, Simone, and Zombie Charity were seen actually watching Passions, and when the television in the Bennett's kitchen covered what would have been Theresa's execution, the news report actually pre-empted Passions, cutting in during the theme song just after the appearance of the logo. In a 2002 episode Theresa was giving birth while stuck in a cabin with Ethan and Gwen; she had a hallucination in which the three of them did a dance together and sang the show's theme song [...] "Breathe." [...] In 2004, TC made a reference to [...] "that crazy soap after Days of our Lives", which in most areas airs before Passions. In one episode Fancy Crane used a magazine to hide her face from Noah; the magazine had an image of the then-unseen Rachel Barrett with the sentence [...] "Who is she?" [...] under the Passions logo. Fancy later commented that serials [...] "are just like life; you never know what's going to happen!" [...] In an early 2006 episode, Ivy and assistant Valerie were searching on the internet for Miguel to bring him back to Harmony and interfere with Fox and Kay's relationship. They could not find him, but Valerie tracked down his last place of employment: he was last seen working as a gardener in some suburban town on a street called Wisteria Lane. At that time, Jesse Metcalfe (ex-Miguel) was playing a gardener on the prime-time serial Desperate Housewives, which takes place on a street called Wisteria Lane. In the March 30, 2006 episode, while Passions reruns were airing on the Sci-Fi Channel, Simone compared life in Harmony to living in a show on the Sci-Fi Channel. Similarly, in the August 10, 2006 episode, Theresa commented that her office was not like an NBC daytime serial, and that she would not hire <b>somebody</b> <b>just</b> because he looked like Jesse Metcalfe (who had portrayed her brother Miguel from 1999â€“2004). A similar inside joke occurred when the character Fancy had a dream that she was a cheerleader; in real life, Fancy's portrayer Emily Harper was a [...] "Laker Girl" [...] (cheerleader for the Los Angeles Lakers) from 2000-2003.|$|E
