While in the US, she read numerous children's books; these later influenced her own writings. After graduating, she spent a year working in the US before returning to Indonesia in 1998. Upon her return to Indonesia, she spent three years working in the human resources department of Hanjin Shipping but left after she had two miscarriages, the first when she was seven months pregnant and the second at seven weeks.

25|$|One {{cause of}} the change in young women's {{behavior}} was World War I which ended in November 1918. The death of large numbers of young men in the war, and the Spanish flu epidemic which struck in 1918 killing between 20–40 million people, inspired in young people a feeling that life is short and could end at any moment. Therefore, young women wanted to spend their youth enjoying their life and freedom rather than just <b>staying</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> and waiting for a man to marry them.|$|E
40|$|This study {{compared}} the gender roles {{and attitudes toward}} women‟s and men‟s social roles of <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> fathers and employed fathers recruited on the Internet. The relationship between gender roles and attitudes toward women‟s and men‟s social roles on reasons for becoming a <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> father were also investigated. It was predicted that <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> fathers would endorse more traditionally feminine characteristics for themselves and would have more nontraditional attitudes toward men‟s and women‟s social roles than employed fathers. In addition, {{it was predicted that}} fathers who choose to <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> for practical reasons (i. e. lost job) would be more traditional in their gender role attitudes than fathers who choose to <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> for other reasons (i. e. really wanted to care for the children). Although <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> and employed fathers reported having similar feminine and masculine characteristics, <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> fathers reported having less traditional gender role attitudes than employed fathers. Biosocial theory (Eagly & Wood, 1999) suggests that <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> fathers may have less traditional attitudes about gender roles because the gender role they are acting out is a non-traditional role for men. <b>Stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> fathers reported that they really wanted to stay home with their children more than any other reason, whereas the least reported reason for choosing to stay home was having a child with special needs. Contrary to a prediction based on evolutionary psychology, <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> and employed fathers also reported that their children resembled them to the same degree. The results of this study will contribute further information about a group of fathers that have been under-studied and may also provide helpful information to support groups for <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> and employed fathers.

500|$|Czolgosz {{had lived}} on his parents' farm near Cleveland {{beginning}} in 1898, working little—he may {{have suffered a}} nervous breakdown. [...] He {{is known to have}} attended a speech by anarchist Emma Goldman in May 1901 in Cleveland: [...] he approached her before the speech and asked her to recommend books on anarchism; she obliged. [...] The talk, in which Goldman did not advocate violence but expressed understanding for those driven to it, was a great influence on Czolgosz; he later stated that her words burned in his head. [...] He came to see her at her Chicago home in July as she was about to depart on a trip with her daughter to Buffalo to see the fair, and the two anarchists rode together to the train station. [...] Goldman expressed concern to another radical that Czolgosz (who was using the alias Fred Nieman) was following her around; soon after, he apparently departed Chicago. [...] William Arntz, a worker at a park in Canton, stated that he had seen a man resembling Czolgosz in mid-1901, when the President was <b>staying</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> and sometimes visiting the park. [...] The man was wearing two guns, and when Arntz reminded him that firearms were not permitted outside the park's shooting range, responded dismissively. [...] Arntz sought the police, but the man was never found.|$|E

2500|$|In her dissertation, Elizabeth J. Fleitz,a PhD in English with Concentration in Rhetoric and Writing from Bowling Green State University, {{argues that}} the cookbook, which she {{describes}} as inherently multimodal, is an important feminist rhetorical text. [...] According to Fleitz, women were able to form relationships with other women through communicating in socially acceptable literature like cook books; “As long as the woman fulfills her gender role, little {{attention is paid to}} the increasing amount of power she gains in both the private and public spheres.” Women who would have been committed to <b>staying</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> could become published authors, gaining a voice in a phallogocentric society without being viewed as threats. [...] Women revised and adapted different modes of writing to fit their own needs. According to Cinthia Gannett, author of [...] "Gender and the Journal," [...] diary writing, which evolved from men’s journal writing, has “integrate and confirm women’s perceptions of domestic, social, and spiritual life, and invoke a sense of self.” It is these methods of remediation that characterize women’s literature as multimodal. The recipes inside of the cookbooks also qualify as multimodal. Recipes delivered through any medium, whether that be a cookbook or a blog, can be considered multimodal because of the “interaction between body, experience, knowledge, and memory, multimodal literacies” that all relate to one another to create our understanding of the recipe. Recipe exchanging is an opportunity for networking and social interaction. According to Fleitz, “This interaction is undeniably multimodal, as this network “makes do” with alternative forms of communication outside dominant discursive methods, in order to further and promote women’s social and political goals.” Cookbooks are only a singular example of the capacity of multimodality to build community identities, but they aptly demonstrate the nuanced aspects of multimodality. Multimodality does not just encompasses tangible components, such as text, images, sound etc., but it also draws from experiences, prior knowledge, and cultural understanding.|$|E

5000|$|The {{traditional}} role of [...] "father" [...] {{in the household}} is evolving; fathers are now expected to embrace more hands-on duties with their children.
