40|$|The {{measurement}} of 1 H transverse paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) {{has been used}} in biomolecular systems to determine long-range distance restraints and to visualize sparsely-populated transient states. The intrinsic flexibility of most nitroxide and metalchelating paramagnetic spin-labels, however, complicates the quantitative interpretation of PREs due to delocalization of the paramagnetic center. Here, we present a novel, disulfide-linked nitroxide spin label, R 1 p, as an alternative to these flexible labels for PRE studies. When introduced at solvent-exposed α-helical positions in two model proteins, calmodulin (CaM) and T 4 lysozyme (T 4 L), EPR measurements show that the R 1 p side chain exhibits dramatically reduced internal motion compared to the commonly used R 1 spin label (generated by reacting cysteine with the spin labeling compound often referred to as MTSL). Further, only a single nitroxide position is necessary to account for the PREs arising from <b>CaM</b> <b>S</b> 17 R 1 p, while an ensemble comprising multiple conformations is necessary for those observed for <b>CaM</b> <b>S</b> 17 R 1.

40|$|How can a {{national}} health service be conducive to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) ? Can the use of CAM encourage an integrated approach and, perhaps, {{a national}} health service in the United State? In the U. <b>S.,</b> <b>CAM</b> has existed for hundreds of years, and many other industrialized countries such as England, France, Germany, China, and Japan have allowed these older traditional forms of medicine to coexist with modem allopathic medicine. However, in the U. S., {{with the rise of}} the modem scientific era, allopathic medicine created a distinctive divide between traditional and nontraditional forms of medicine, and since then. The author compares the history and social structure of England and the United States to see how CAM’s relationship to biomedicine is different. Methodology includes an introduction to CAM, a socio-historical overview of the rise of medicine, a review of more recent policy changes that enabled the growth of CAM, as well as a cross-cultural survey study comparing patient views on CAM and biomedicine.

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{dramatic}} growth {{in the use of}} complementary and alternative medicine or therapies (CAM) in the United States in recent years (Barnes, Bloom, & Nahin, 2008; NCCAM, 2013). Research in the health care fields has reflected the increased interest for using CAM to achieve optimal wellness (Sewitch, Cepoiu, Rigillo, & Sproule, 2008). In the U. <b>S.,</b> <b>CAM</b> signify the use of indigenous or Eastern-based therapies that collaborate and integrate with Western practices to promote healing (Berman & Straus, 2004). CAM are based in a holistic philosophy of health practices that address the mind, body and spirit of an individual (Caspi, Koithan, & Criddle, 2004). Similarly, the counseling profession focuses on a wellness orientation to meeting mental health needs (Myers & Sweeney, 2008; Mellin, Hunt, & Nichols, 2011). As individuals increasingly turn to alternative methods to address mental health concerns, it has become critical for counselors to examine how clients experience an integrative mental health (IMH) counseling approach.

40|$|The role of {{reactive}} {{oxygen species}} (ROS) in the regulation of hair follicle (HF) cycle and skin homeostasis is poorly characterized. ROS have been traditionally linked to human disease and aging, but recent findings suggest that they can also have beneficial physiological functions in vivo in mammals. To test this hypothesis, we transiently switched on in situ ROS production in mouse skin. This process activated cell proliferation in the tissue and, interestingly, in the bulge region of the HF, a major reservoir of epidermal stem cells, promoting hair growth, as well as stimulating tissue repair after severe burn injury. We further show that these effects were associated with a transient Src kinase phosphorylation at Tyr 416 and with a strong transcriptional activation of the prolactin family 2 subfamily c of growth factors. Our results point to potentially relevant modes of skin homeostasis regulation and demonstrate that a local and transient ROS production can regulate stem cell and tissue function in the whole organism.

Familial Aβ variants bearing substitutions at positions 21 – 23 are primarily associated with CAA, although they manifest with strikingly different clinical phenotypes: cerebral hemorrhage or dementia. The recently reported Piedmont L 34 V Aβ mutant, located outside the hot spot 21 – 23, shows a similar hemorrhagic phenotype, albeit less aggressive than the widely studied Dutch E 22 Q variant. We monitored the apoptotic events occurring after stimulation of human brain microvascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells with nonfibrillar structures of both variants and wild-type Aβ 40. Induction of analogous caspase-mediated mitochondrial pathways was elicited by all peptides, although within different time frames and intensity. Activated pathways were susceptible to pharmacological modulation either through direct inhibition of mitochondrial cytochrome c release or {{by the action of}} pan- and pathway-specific caspase inhibitors, giving a clear indication of the independent or synergistic engagement of both extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms. Structural analyses of the Aβ peptides showed that apoptosis preceded fibril formation, correlating with the presence of oligomers and/or protofibrils.

Other issues, such as the aromaticity of the corresponding transition states, have also been considered. These results indicate that the major factor controlling the observed regioselectivity is the more stabilising interaction between the deformed reactants in the [6, 6] reaction pathway along the entire reaction coordinate. Why [6, 6]? The preference for [6, 6] over [5, 6] bonds in cycloaddition reactions involving C 60 is experimentally well-established (see figure).

40|$|The endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) is {{regulated}} by diverse protein kinase pathways, yet eNOS activity ultimately {{depends on the}} ubiquitous calcium regulatory protein calmodulin (CaM). In these studies, we establish that CaM itself undergoes phosphorylation in endothelial cells and that CaM phosphorylation attenuates eNOS activation. Using [32 P]orthophosphoric acid biosynthetic labeling, we found that CaM is a phosphoprotein in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) and that the kinase CK 2 promotes CaM phosphorylation in BAEC. Phosphorylation of CaM by purified CK 2 in vitro reduces the Vmax of immunopurified eNOS {{by a factor of}} 2 but has no effect on the KA for CaM or calcium. Additionally, [32 P]orthophosphoric acid biosynthetic labeling of mutant CaM-transfected BAEC revealed that phosphorylation of Ser- 81 to alanine mutant <b>CaM</b> (“phosphonull” <b>S</b> 81 A mutant) is dramatically reduced relative to WT, whereas phosphorylation of the “phosphomimetic” Ser- 81 to aspartate (S 81 D) mutant is unchanged. Further studies using Escherichia coli-expressed and phenyl-Sepharose-purified CaM mutants revealed that the S 81 A mutation abrogates in vitro CK 2 -mediated phosphorylation of CaM, whereas phosphorylation of the <b>S</b> 81 D <b>CaM</b> mutant by CK 2 is preserved. Additionally, we found that the phosphomimetic <b>S</b> 101 D <b>CaM</b> mutant is impaired in its ability to activate eNOS. Taken together, these results suggest that phosphorylation of CaM inhibits eNOS catalysis and proceeds in a hierarchical manner, initially requiring phosphorylation of the CaM Ser- 81 residue.

40|$|Faculty adviser: Razvan CorneaThe {{physiological}} {{basis of}} muscle-generated motor activity {{depends on the}} precise regulation of intracellular Ca 2 + ions. Central to this process is the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), a special organelle in muscle cells {{that is responsible for}} ion storage. The Ca 2 + ions are released from the SR through a large conductance channel known as the ryanodine receptor (RyR). The channel’s activity is in turn regulated by intracellular messengers, including FK 506 binding proteins (FKBP 12. 6 & 12. 0), and calmodulin (CaM). The experimental heart failure drug S 107 has been associated with improved muscle performance, though it is still unclear if it directly affects the binding activity of either the FKBPs or CaM. Here, the effect of S 107 on the binding of fluorescent FKBPs and CaM to RyR is characterized. The results show that S 107 slightly, but significantly, decreases the binding affinity of CaM; though, only in nanomolar calcium concentrations, and when the RyR is treated with oxidized glutathione. S 107 has no significant effect on the binding of FKBP to RyR. Prior to this research, it was thought that S 107 might significantly increase the binding affinity of FKBP. The effect of <b>S</b> 107 on <b>CaM</b> binding to RyR has not been previously investigated.

For ZnS the size of the nanoparticles is larger than for CdS although their properties also resemble those of the target when they are produced upon irradiation in the visible.

An inelastic feature, related to the excitation of a vibrational breathing mode of the graphene lattice, was found at 360 meV. The change in the differential electrical conductance produced by this inelastic feature, which {{is associated with the}} electron-phonon interaction strength, varies spatially from one position to other of the graphene supercell. This inhomogeneity in the electronic properties of graphene on Ru(0001) results from local variations of the carbon-ruthenium interaction due to the lattice mismatch between the graphene and the Ru(0001) lattices.

October 25 - 30, Florence (Italy) In this paper, {{we report}} on the results of experiments with an implementation of H-P 2 PSIP, which allows the exchange of information among different DHTs (Distributed Hash Tables) making use of a hierarchical architecture. This paper validates our previous H-P 2 PSIP proposal in an environment with a real TCP/IP stack close to a real scenario. The results show how the benefits of this real H-P 2 PSIP implementation in terms of routing performance (number of hops), delay and routing state (number of routing entries) are better than a flat DHT overlay network and how the exchange of information among different DHT overlay networks is feasible.

40|$|Atomic {{steps at}} growth {{surfaces}} are important heterogeneous sources for nucleation of epitaxial nano-objects. In {{the presence of}} misfit strain, we show that the nucleation process takes place referentially at the upper terrace of the step {{as a result of}} the local stress relaxation. Evidence for strain-induced nucleation comes from the direct observation by postgrowth, atomic resolution, Z-contrast imaging of an InAs-rich region in a nanowire located on the upper terrace surface of an interfacial diatomic step.

40|$|Despite {{the depth}} of {{interest}} in complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) within the nursing community, the intersection between nurses, nursing and CAM has largely avoided sociological analysis. This paper presents findings {{from one part of}} an ongoing exploratory study of how nurses present and interpret the apparent affinity of their profession with CAM. A text analysis of papers published from within the nursing community on CAM was conducted. Within the broad area of professional identity, differentiation and development, two dominant themes emerged from the analysis. Firstly, the use of professional distancing to underpin the legitimacy of the nursing/CAM axis; and second, the potential offered by the relationship for a reconstruction of lines of professional authority. As one dimension {{of the way in which}} nursing 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> intersection with <b>CAM</b> is being constructed and perpetuated, the relationship with medicine appears to be of significance and requires further attention.

40|$|DNA {{labeling}} in vivo using nucleoside analogues is {{a current}} experimental approach to determine cell proliferation rates in cell cultures and tissues. It {{has also been}} successfully used to localize adult stem cell niches through the identification of nucleoside label-retaining cells (LRC) in long-term experiments. A major hindrance of this methodology relies on the selection of adequate procedures to quantify the nucleoside analogue content from image data files. Here we propose a simple procedure using Fiji image processing software to accurately calculate nucleoside analogue retaining chromatin/total chromatin (LRC/DAPI) signal ratios in the well-known mouse hair follicle stem cell niche.

40|$|In mammals, {{methylation}} of cytosine C- 5 {{position is}} a major heritable epigenetic mark on the DNA molecule. Maintenance of proper DNA methylation patterns is a key process during embryo development and in the maintenance of adult tissue homeostasis. The use of experimental procedures based on the chemical modification of cytosine by sodium bisulfite {{and the development of}} antibodies recognizing 5 mC have essentially contributed to our knowledge on DNA methylation dynamics in normal and disease states. Here we describe standard procedures for bisulfite sequencing, methylation-specific PCR, and 5 mC immunodetection using mouse skin and the hair follicle stem cell niche as model tissues.

40|$|SummaryThe {{presynaptic}} metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) mGluR 7 modulates excitatory neurotransmission by regulating neurotransmitter {{release and}} plays {{a critical role}} in certain forms of synaptic plasticity. Although the dynamic regulation of mGluR 7 surface expression governs a form of metaplasticity in the hippocampus, {{little is known about the}} molecular mechanisms regulating mGluR 7 trafficking. We now show that mGluR 7 surface expression is stabilized by both PKC phosphorylation and by receptor binding to the PDZ domain-containing protein PICK 1. Phosphorylation of mGluR 7 on serine 862 (<b>S</b> 862) inhibits <b>CaM</b> binding, thereby increasing mGluR 7 surface expression and receptor binding to PICK 1. Furthermore, in mice lacking PICK 1, PKC-dependent increases in mGluR 7 phosphorylation and surface expression are diminished, and mGluR 7 -dependent plasticity at mossy fiber-interneuron hippocampal synapses is impaired. These data support a model in which PICK 1 binding and PKC phosphorylation act together to stabilize mGluR 7 on the cell surface in vivo...|$|R
