Krueger realised that Hyane harbour was too small to support the entire division, but there were good beaches around Salami Plantation on the western shore of Los Negros.

5|$|In his High Court appeal Dietrich was {{represented}} by David Grace, QC.

He argued that he should have been provided with counsel at public expense, given the <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crime with which he was charged. Alternatively, he argued that the judge should have stayed or adjourned the trial until he was able to obtain counsel himself. His argument was based on the common law tradition that an accused is entitled to a fair trial.|$|E
5|$|Athletes have {{historically}} been willing to take legal and health risks to improve their performance, with some even stating their willingness to risk their lives, as exemplified by research by Mirkin, Goldman and Connor in researching attitudes to the so-called Goldman dilemma. To prevent use of performance-enhancing substances, athletes must submit to drug tests that are conducted {{both in and out}} of competition by anti-doping officials or accredited medical staff. Penalized athletes are susceptible to higher testing upon return to competition. Athletes found to have taken substances on the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned list receive sanctions and may be banned from competition for a period of time that corresponds to the <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> infraction. However, the use of substances not on the prohibited list may also result in sanctions if the substance is deemed similar to a banned substance in either composition or effect. Athletes may also be sanctioned for missing tests, seeking to avoid testing or tampering with results, refusing to submit to testing, through circumstantial evidence, or confession of use.|$|E

40|$|EQUIP is a {{multicomponent}} peer-helping {{program that}} aims to reduce recidivism among delinquent adolescents by decreasing their cognitive distortions, improv¬ing their social skills and stimulating their moral development. In an earlier study in a high-security juvenile correctional facility in the Netherlands, the EQUIP program {{was found to have}} positive effects on reducing cognitive distortions in delinquent male adolescents. In this quasi-experimental pre/post-treatment test study, <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EQUIP program on recidivism and on cognitive distortions in relation to recidivism were investigated. Participants were recruited from four comparable high-security juvenile correctional facilities for offenders between <b>the</b> ages <b>of</b> 12 and 18 years. One of these facilities implemented the EQUIP program (n = 49); the other three facilities provided the control group (n = 28). As expected, the experimental group showed a greater reduction in cognitive distortions (egocentric bias, minimizing/mislabeling and blaming others) than the control group. However, no differences were found in speed or <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> reoffending between <b>the</b> adolescents in the experimental group and those in the control group. <b>The</b> number <b>of</b> repeat offenses in the experimental group was smaller than in the control group.
