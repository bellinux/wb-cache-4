40|$|This paper {{provides}} a formal systematic review and meta-analysis examining {{the evidence of}} the effectiveness of interventions intended to reduce illness through improvements in drinking water, sanitation facilities and hygiene practices. The comprehensive literature search and bibliographic review shows that in developing countries, water quality interventions, specifically point-of-use treatment, reduced diarrhea illness levels, but this effect was mainly seen with the provision of household connections and use of water without household <b>storage.</b> <b>Hygiene</b> interventions, especially those promoting hand-washing, were effective. Only limited data were available for sanitation interventions, but these suggested effectiveness in reducing diarrhea. Multifactorial interventions consisting of water supply, sanitation and hygiene education acted to reduce diarrhea but were not more effective than individual interventions...|$|E
40|$|Testing of {{planting}} material for freedom from phytopathogenic bacteria is an important, although not exclusive, method {{for control of}} bacterial diseases of plants. Ideally, pathogen-free or pathogen-/disease-resistant planting material is desirable, but this situation is not always possible on a practical basis. For most bacterial pathogens, resistance is not available in cultivated hosts, and production of pathogen-free planting material requires strict certification schemes via several routes. These include (i) indexing, with subsequent removal of infected/contaminated material from the production chain; (ii) meristem and other tissue culture production systems; (iii) thermo- or chemotherapy; (iv) plant or seed surface disinfection for epiphytic bacterial pathogens; (v) avoidance or decontamination of contaminated production factors such as substrate, soil or irrigation water. These methods cannot guarantee 100 % freedom from the pathogen or disease during crop multiplication from certified planting material, because of factors such as sampling error, experimental error, test sensitivities, limitations of therapies (e. g. phytotoxicity or insufficient penetration), re-introduction of the pathogen, insufficient hygiene or decontamination during planting and multiplication of clean propagating material, and manipulations during trade and production. These factors are discussed with reference to several bacterial plant diseases, in particular control of bacterial brown rot and {{ring rot of potato}} in Europe and North America. The most efficient control of bacterial diseases can be expected through a combination of the use of healthy/tested planting material and good cultivation practice, including strict crop and <b>storage</b> <b>hygiene...</b>|$|E
50|$|Foodborne illness usually {{arises from}} {{improper}} handling, preparation, or food <b>storage.</b> Good <b>hygiene</b> practices before, during, and after food preparation {{can reduce the}} chances of contracting an illness.

One example is the Water Wise Women Initiative carried out since 2007 in initially five local communities throughout Jordan. The initiative builds on the efforts of volunteers organized in 50 community development centers by supported by the Jordanian Hashemite Fund for Human Development (JOHUD). It trains female volunteers called [...] "change pioneers" [...] in topics such as water saving, rainwater harvesting, water <b>storage,</b> plumbing, <b>hygiene</b> and water use for house gardening. It thus provides opportunities for women to generate income and to reduce expenses for bottled water, water bought from trucks and hired plumbers.

40|$|Background. Acute {{pesticide}} poisoning (APP) is {{a serious}} problem worldwide. Because the burden of childhood APP is unknown in Tanzania, this study describes the distribution, circumstances, and patterns of APP involving children under 18 years in Tanzania. Methodology. A 12 -month prospective study was conducted in 10 Tanzanian healthcare facilities in 2006 using a data collection tool for surveillance. Results. Of 53 childhood poisoning cases identified, 56. 6 % were female. The most common poisoning circumstances were accidents (49. 1 %) and suicide (30. 2 %). The most vulnerable children were 16 - 17 years old (30. 2 %). Suicide was significantly more common in females (PRR females/males = 1. 66; 95 % CI = 1. 03 – 2. 68) and accidental cases were more common in children aged 10 years or younger. Suicide was concentrated in children over 10 years, comprising 53 % of cases in this age group. Organophosphates (OPs), zinc phosphide, and endosulfan were common amongst reported poisoning agents. The annual APP incidence rate was 1. 61 / 100, 000. Conclusion. APP is common among children in this region of Tanzania. Prevention of suicide in older children should address mental health issues and control access to toxic pesticides. Prevention of accidents in younger children requires safer <b>storage</b> and <b>hygiene</b> measures. Diverse interventions are needed to reduce pesticide poisoning among children in Tanzania...|$|R
40|$|AIMS—A {{case-control study}} was {{performed}} to evaluate soft contact lens (SCL) wear modality as {{a risk factor for}} microbial keratitis.  METHODS—Contact lens wearers presenting as new patients to Moorfields Eye Hospital accident and emergency department during a 12  month period completed a self administered questionnaire detailing demographic data and contact lens use habits. Cases were patients with a clinical diagnosis of SCL related microbial keratitis. Controls were SCL users attending with disorders unrelated to contact lens wear. Odds ratios (estimates of relative risks) and 95 % confidence limits (CL) were calculated through multivariable logistic regression analysis.  RESULTS—There were 89  cases and 566  controls. A substantially increased risk with 1 - 4 weekly disposable SCL compared with non-disposable SCL was identified among both daily wear (DW) (odds ratio = 3. 51, 95 % CL 1. 60 - 7. 66, p= 0. 002) and extended wear (odds ratio 4. 76,  95 % CL 1. 52 - 14. 87, p= 0. 007) users after adjustment for demographic, lens use and hygiene variables. Other significant factors among DW users were "occasional" overnight use, use of chlorine based (as opposed to other chemical) systems in combination with poor <b>storage</b> case <b>hygiene,</b> and irregular disinfection.  CONCLUSION—Properties of some disposable SCL may be partly responsible for these excess risks. It is also possible, however, that this finding is largely a reflection of widespread complacency among patients and practitioners with respect to disposable SCL fitting and use.    Keywords: microbial keratitis; disposable contact lense...|$|R

40|$|It {{was widely}} {{anticipated}} {{that after the}} introduction of silicone hydrogel lenses, the risk of microbial keratitis would be lower than with hydrogel lenses because of the reduction in hypoxic effects on the corneal epithelium. Large-scale epidemiological studies have confirmed that the absolute and relative risk of microbial keratitis is unchanged with overnight use of silicone hydrogel materials. The key findings include the following: (1) The risk of infection with 30 nights of silicone hydrogel use is equivalent to 6 nights of hydrogel extended wear; (2) Occasional overnight lens use {{is associated with a}} greater risk than daily lens use; (3) The rate of vision loss due to corneal infection with silicone hydrogel contact lenses is similar to that seen in hydrogel lenses; (4) The spectrum of causative organisms is similar to that seen in hydrogel lenses, and the material type does not impact the corneal location of presumed microbial keratitis; and (5) Modifiable risk factors for infection include overnight lens use, the degree of exposure, failing to wash hands before lens handling, and <b>storage</b> case <b>hygiene</b> practice. The lack of change in the absolute risk of disease would suggest that exposure to large number of pathogenic organisms can overcome any advantages obtained from eliminating the hypoxic effects of contact lenses. Epidemiological studies remain important in the assessment of new materials and modalities.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Volatile organic {{compounds}} (VOCs) {{contribute significantly to}} food flavour {{and can be used}} as indicators of quality, age of <b>storage,</b> and <b>hygiene</b> condition of stored products. The VOCs in the headspace of three different samples - healthy wheat, Rhyzopertha dominica, and wheat with R. dominica - were analysed at 25 °C by solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) coupled with gas chromatography-flame ionisation detection (GC-FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). All the experimental conditions were kept consistent except a polar column and a non-polar column were used to assess the differences in volatile fingerprints. RESULTS: A total of 114 volatiles were identified by both the polar and non-polar columns, of which 48 were specific to one of the three samples tested. The volatiles were mainly carbonyl chemical compounds such as aldehydes, ketones and alcohols. GC-MS results showed slightly more VOCs were identified from the polar column. The total number for the three samples was 43 from the polar column compared to 39 from the non-polar column. Conversely, 30 VOCs unique to a given sample were identified from the non-polar column compared to 18 from the polar column. CONCLUSION: The use of both polar and non-polar columns is essential to capture the full range of VOCs produced by the three specific sample types investigated. The data can form the basis of enquiry into the relationship between storage and grain quality, and insect infestation and grain quality by observing the impact that these circumstances have on the production of volatile organic compound...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{our survey}} was to {{evaluate}} {{the changes in the}} microbiological quality of locally produced/packed food following implementation of HACCP systems in: A. an ice-cream producing factory, B. a company preparing pre- packed sandwiches, C. a water-bottling company. Emphasis was given to the processing steps, transportation, storage and retailing. The results show the positive effects that a HACCP system, introduced in an ice cream factory, had on the microbiological quality of the final product and the total quality/hygiene management. Among others, two main hygiene problems were detected and corrected (E. N. Kokkinakis, G. A. Fragkiadakis, S. H. Ioakeimidi, I. B. Giankoulof, A. N. Kokkinaki, 2008, Microbiological quality of ice-cream before and after HACCP implementation: A factory case study. Czech Journal of Food Science, 26, 383 - 391). Concerning the sandwiches producing plant, no special food-safety problem was detected. The majority of the sandwiches were usually consumed within 1 - 3 days, however, indicator bacteria values cause concerns on possible dangers to human health and prove the necessity of monitoring the food-storage conditions at the retailer's level (E. N. Kokkinakis, G. A. Fragkiadakis, A. N. Kokkinaki, N. E. Lapidakis, 2011, Microbiological quality of pre-packed sandwiches at the retailing level, Acta Alimentaria, under revision). Finally, concerning the water-bottling company, the results indicated the need to improve the HACCP system, in order to continuously monitor the water-supply source, and to fully implement the correct <b>storage</b> conditions, <b>hygiene</b> procedures, and customer training at supermarkets (E. N. Kokkinakis, G. A. Fragkiadakis, A. N. Kokkinaki, 2008, Monitoring microbiological quality of bottled water as suggested by HACCP methodology, Food Control, 19, 975 - 961) ...|$|R
40|$|Post-harvest loss is a {{major problem}} for farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. Substantial amounts of cereal grain are lost each year due to factors such as {{exposure}} to rain, extreme drought, physical damage and invasion of microorganisms. This decreases the availability of food/feed which in turn increases prices and the consumption of unsafe food. Therefore storage systems need to be developed to ensure a safe food supply with low losses. The project aimed to evaluate the inhibiting effects of Meyerozyma guilliermondii against mould growth on maize under local conditions in Cameroon. This was in order to determine if M. guilliermondii could be used for biocontrol storage of moist maize under airtight conditions. Previous studies have shown this system, together with the yeast Wickerhamomyces anomalus as biocontrol, to be very effective for grain preservation. Mini silos were inoculated with different moulds and yeasts. W. anomalus was used as a control since it has previously been shown to have an inhibiting effect on mould growth. Furthermore the project aimed to study local post-harvest systems for maize in two different areas of Cameroon. This was done by means of visiting farms and interviewing farmers. The new biocontrol system of moist grain was also explained to the farmers in order to introduce the idea to them and see if they were willing to try a new <b>storage</b> system. A <b>hygiene</b> study of the storages was also done by microbial quantification and calculation of colony forming units (CFU). No inhibition of mould growth was detected for either M. guilliermondii or W. anomalus. Several factors such as low moisture content, too much mould and the size and the material of the mini silos made the results questionable. More studies need to be made regarding the biocontrol activity of M. guilliermondii. The <b>storage</b> method and <b>hygiene</b> varied between different farms in the Nforya-Bamenda area. However none of the local storage systems seemed to have better hygienic status for yeasts and moulds. The biocontrol system seemed suitable for introduction in Nforya-Bamenda for several practical and socio-economic reasons. With current storage technology it would be no use increasing yield per hectare for maize in this region since farmers already produce more than they can store. Moreover, the change in maize storage technology could prove essential to improving women and children’s health in Cameroon, since many farmers smoke their maize indoors using fire-wood...|$|R
40|$|Safe and {{adequate}} water supply {{is a vital}} element to preserve human health; however, access to clean water is limited in many developing countries. Furthermore, improved water sources are often contaminated with fecal matters and consumption of unsafe water poses a great public health risk. This study seeks to identify determinants of microbial contamination of household drinking water under multiple-use water systems in rural areas of Fogera and Mecha districts of Ethiopia. In this analysis, {{a random sample of}} 454 households was surveyed from February to March 2014, and water samples from community sources and storage containers were collected and tested for fecal contamination. The number of Escherichia coli (E. coli) colony forming units per 100 ml (cfu/ 100 ml) water was used as an indicator of fecal contamination. The results show that 50 % of households used protected water sources, 38 % used unprotected wells/ spring and 12 % used surface water sources. However, water microbiological tests demonstrated that 58 % of household storage water samples and 74 % of water sources were contaminated with E. coli. After controlling for household sanitary factors, high level of E. coli bacteria colonies were observed in unprotected water compared to surface water and protected wells/springs sources. To ensure the quality and safety of water stored in the household, our findings suggest that point-of-use water treatment, safe water handling and <b>storage,</b> proper <b>hygiene</b> practices such as washing hands after critical times and proper disposal of household garbage should be promoted. On-site water wells should be properly designed to prevent seepage from unhygienic household pit latrine.

Measuring changes in the practices, as well as the microbiological quality of water in the containers, were the instruments used to determine whether the programme had a positive educational effect. This paper reports on selected elements of the practices measurement. Structured interviews, observations and statistical analyses assessed three variables – container <b>hygiene,</b> container <b>storage</b> and hand <b>hygiene.</b> Results indicated insignificant improvements in practices. This was supported by insignificant improvements in the microbiological water quality, that was still above health-safety limits. This implied that short-term “quick fix” HHA&E programmes would tend to be ineffective.

Participants were undergraduate students enrolled in the Lebanese American University from different majors and years of study, from different areas of residence, living alone or with others, and having working or non-working mothers. They completed a questionnaire of 16 food handling practices and 14 food safety knowledge questions related to preparation, cross-contamination, <b>storage</b> and <b>hygiene.</b> On average, the students scored 53. 6 ± 15. 8 % and 44. 7 ± 14. 3 % on the knowledge and practices parts, respectively. Female students scored higher on both practices and knowledge questions than male students; however, the difference was significant (p < 0. 001) for the practices part only. Health-related majors scored significantly (p ≤ 0. 001) better on both practices and knowledge questions. Senior students scored highest on the knowledge questions, followed by juniors, sophomores and finally freshmen and the difference was borderline significant (p = 0. 07). The area of residence had a significant (p = 0. 006) effect on the food safety practices questions. Students living with parents scored higher in both knowledge and practices parts than those living alone or with roommates; howkver, the difference was significant (p = 0. 009) in the knowledge part only. Students who cook all the time showed a significant (p = 0. 001) lower difference in terms of their food safety knowledge compared to those who cook less frequently. Food handling practices and food safety knowledge scores were significantly (p < 0. 001) related with a weak to moderate correlation coefficient (R = 0. 231).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{establish}} the absolute risk of contact lens (CL) -related microbial keratitis, {{the incidence of}} vision loss and risk factors for disease. DESIGN: A prospective, 12 -month, population-based surveillance study. PARTICIPANTS: New cases of CL-related microbial keratitis presenting in Australia over a 12 -month period were identified through surveillance of all ophthalmic practitioners (numerator). Case detection was augmented by records' audits at major ophthalmic centers. The denominator (number of wearers of different CL types in the community) was established using a national telephone survey of 35, 914 individuals. TESTING: Cases and controls were interviewed by telephone to determine subject demographics and CL wear history. Visual outcomes were determined 6 months after the initial event. Annualized incidence and confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for different severities of disease and multivariable analysis was used in risk factor analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Annualized incidence (with CI) of disease and vision loss by CL type and wear modality and identification of independent risk factors. RESULTS: We identified 285 eligible cases of CL-related microbial keratitis and 1798 controls. In daily wear rigid gas-permeable CL wearers, the annualized incidence per 10, 000 wearers was 1. 2 (CI, 1. 1 - 1. 5); in daily wear soft CL wearers 1. 9 (CI, 1. 8 - 2. 0); soft CL wearers (occasional overnight use) 2. 2 (CI, 2. 0 - 2. 5); daily disposable CL wearers 2. 0 (CI, 1. 7 - 2. 4); daily disposable CL wearers (occasional overnight use) 4. 2 (CI, 3. 1 - 6. 6); daily wear silicone hydrogel CL wearers 11. 9 (CI, 10. 0 - 14. 6); silicone hydrogel CL wearers (occasional overnight use) 5. 5 (CI, 4. 5 - 7. 2); overnight wear soft CL wearers 19. 5 (CI, 14. 6 - 29. 5) and in overnight wear of silicone hydrogel 25. 4 (CI, 21. 2 - 31. 5).

40|$|Abstract Background On 1 st March 2010, a major {{landslide}} {{occurred on}} Mt. Elgon in Eastern Uganda. This {{was triggered by}} heavy rains that lasted over three months. The landslide buried three villages in Bududa district, killing over 400 and displacing an estimate of 5, 000 people. A comprehensive assessment of water, sanitation and hygiene was urgently needed to inform interventions by the Ministries of Health, and Relief, Disaster Preparedness and Refugees, Uganda. Methods This was a cross-sectional study where both qualitative and quantitative data were collected {{two weeks after the}} disaster. Quantitative interviews involved 397 heads of households and qualitative methods comprised of 27 Key Informant interviews, four focus group discussions and observations. The survey quantified water safety (collection, treatment, <b>storage)</b> and <b>hygiene</b> practices. This was supplemented and triangulated with qualitative data that focused on community perceptions and beliefs regarding water and sanitation needs and practices. Quantitative data was entered in Epi-Info Version 3. 2. 2 software and then exported to SPSS Version 12 for analysis. Summary statistics and proportions were generated and bi-variable analysis performed for selected variables. Associations were assessed using odds ratios at 95 % confidence intervals. Qualitative data was analyzed using content analysis. Results Qualitative results showed that there were strong traditional beliefs governing water use and human excreta disposal. The use of river Manafwa water for household consumption was observed to potentially lead to disease outbreaks. Water from this river was reported tastier and the community culturally saw no need to boil drinking water. Latrines were few (23 for 5000 people), shallow, dirty (70 % reported flies, 60 % fecal littering), not separated by sex and had limited privacy and no light at night. This affected their use. Males were 3 times more likely to wash hands with soap after latrine use than females (OR = 3. 584, 95 %CI: 1. 658 - 7. 748). Of the 90 % respondents who indicated that they always washed hands after latrine use, 76 % said they used water and soap. Observations showed that water and soap were inconsistently available at the hand washing facilities. This situation influenced people's sanitation and hygiene behaviours. Nearly half (48 %) indicated that at least a member of their household had fallen sick at least once since arrival at the camp. Conclusion There was inadequate access to safe water in the camp. Pit-latrines were inadequate, poorly maintained and not user-friendly for most people. Responsible authorities should design means of increasing and sustaining access to safe water, increase sanitation facilities and continuously educate the public on the need to observe good hygiene practices. </p...|$|R
40|$|Care is the {{provision}} in the household and the community of time, attention and support to meet the physical, mental, and social needs of the growing child and other household members (ICN 1992). This provision of time, attention, and support is manifest in certain types of behaviors exhibited by caregivers (typically women) : (1) care for pregnant and lactating women, such as providing appropriate rest time or increased food intake; (2) breast-feeding and feeding of very young children; (3) psychosocial stimulation of children and support for their development; (4) food preparation and food <b>storage</b> behaviors; (5) <b>hygiene</b> behaviors; and (6) care for children during illness, including diagnosis of illness and health-seeking behaviors (Engle 1992). Provision of these behaviors depends {{on the availability of}} the resources for care at the household level: education and knowledge, health of the caregiver, time, autonomy, and social support. Although many researchers over the past 30 years have emphasized the importance of behavioral factors for adequate child growth in conditions of poverty and food constraints (Sims, Paolucci, and Morris 1972), the linkages between food availability, caregiving behaviors, and child nutrition are now being recognized at a policy level (ICN 1992). The conceptual model underlying the role of care in child nutrition has been applied more frequently over the past 10 years (UNICEF 1990).

In 1999, around 170 Ghanaian pineapple growers organised themselves with the prime objective of getting a better price for their pineapples. With support from the World Bank, the farmers established a consortium called Farmapine, which consists of five producers' associations, who own 80 % of Farmapine, and two exporting companies, who own the remaining 20 % of the shares. Farmapine provides its shareholders with credit, inputs and advice on cultivation, hygiene and market information. An extra advantage for the farmers is not only higher prices, but prompt payment, two weeks after delivery to Farmapine.

40|$|The {{growth of}} the dairy sector in many ACP countries, welcome {{as it is in}} terms of {{producers}} income and consumers nutrition, is full of challenges. Among them are issues of marketing, regularity of supplies from producers and delivery to markets, health and <b>hygiene,</b> <b>storage</b> and management. In a word, the core issue is formalisation. What used to be an informal sector, with its short but uncontrolled networks of delivery to small numbers of customers is now faced with the task of organising itself. This includes making contracts with producers, suppliers, transporters and sales outlets; setting up and implementing rigid procedures for storage and processing of milk products; and safe distribution. These major points were all raised during a study visit to the dairy sector in Mali undertaken by 18 representatives of dairy enterprises, milk processors and support agencies in early October 2001. Participants from eight countries in West and Central Africa spent 12 days visiting milk collection points, dairies, bottling plants, and cheese and yoghurt producers and discussing future directions for their work. They highlighted the value of sharing experiences and launched an African Milk forum to continue their discussions by email. The visited was organised for CTA by Gret (and local partners, Sénéconseils and Service Plus) who will be a focal point for the follow-up activities.

40|$|This is {{the eighth}} Working paper from a project {{designed}} {{to consider the}} impacts of e-business on the Australian transport system together with any constraints that the transport system might place on e-commerce opportunities. While the previous papers addressed likely impacts, this paper draws on the information gathered and particularly discussions with experts, to consider possible opportunities. As communications technology is advancing rapidly {{it is quite possible}} new enabling technologies, such as nano-technologies, will bring very rapid changes beyond the limits of current imagination. However, we have considered options available now, hoping to inform planning. Changes in the transport task resulting in direct productivity gains. These encompass both efficiency improvements with supply of services for lower costs and effectiveness improvements through the supply of more appropriate services for movement of goods and people. Leadership Constraints: All changes will be dependent on sufficient skill and leadership at management level in businesses, plus financial institutions providing funding and governments setting policies and regulatory frameworks. Intelligent Transport Systems: There are excellent opportunities for productivity gains by linking ITS for traffic information to commercial carriers routing systems to offer better service to commercial vehicles by provision of real-time routing advice or preferential traffic control. European Union estimates that congestion, unreliability and costly inventories {{as a result of the}} lack of information about road network capacities and conditions make up 15 percent of total transportation costs [Alt and Klein, 1998]. Rail and Sea: Increases to the speed of inter-city freight by train and improvement in logistics systems could offer competitive rail options. Additionally, high-speed rail would be particularly attractive for movement of the types of commodities expected to increase in demand. High-speed passenger rail could open destinations in regional areas to international tourists and the revenues would add to the viability of such inter-city links. Improved inter-modal exchange and roll-on roll-off containerised freight could allow sellers and buyers to be indifferent to forwarding mode, leaving the forwarder to use the best available option for each case and time, choosing from a set of modal options, including sea,. Additionally there are: Productivity increases dependent on sufficient transport supply. These are options where transport supply will be an early determinant of success, such as ‘Supermarket to Asia’. Suitable prices for the local and international legs of the export trip, suitable <b>storage</b> and <b>hygiene</b> to maintain foodstuff quality and short transit times are required to allow local suppliers to complete globally in the supply of foodstuffs. International Travel: Increases in international travel for business or leisure could be constrained unless encouragement of entry to Australia via international airports other than Sydney is encouraged. Productivity increases resulting in increased transport demand: Tourism will benefit from lower international airfares and particularly from increased international awareness via e-commerce. However, the degree of benefit to regional tourism will depend on the ability of investors and operators in the industry to provide appropriate infrastructure and services. In particular, higher standards of accommodation and activities/adventure operations will be needed. Currently, most local regional tourism infrastructure is low cost accommodation, where Australian tourists enjoy passive recreation. Success in catering to new markets in individual regions will determine the impacts on transport demand. Finally, the e-business revolution will result in ‘footloose’ international companies able to locate anywhere in the world. Australia has opportunities to attract numbers of such companies through superior natural and social environments, attractive cities and an educated multicultural workforce sensitive to worldwide needs. Our transport demand would increase but such a successful society would be well able to manage demand...|$|R
40|$|Goodbye import duties. Farewell quotas. Hello rules. Trade in {{agricultural}} products from ACP countries {{now has to}} comply with complex new rules, often about quality. We look at how to jump the latest barriers. With world trade now liberalised under the World Trade Organisation, there are new opportunities and challenges for ACP agricultural exporters. The rapid removal of import levies, duties and fixed import quotas for certain products in the industrialised world means that exporters have {{to compete in the}} market place. For this, they need information about the size and accessibility of the market, and the requirements and regulations about quality and packaging. Fortunately there are several information services covering the requirements of importing countries with regard to: Logistical requirements : volumes and sizes of shipments, packaging requirements, shipping and transit <b>storage,</b> health and <b>hygiene</b> standards, and quality control Market intelligence : how to research the market in a country or region, how to contact and develop relationships with importers Finance: how to organise finance and credit while waiting for payment, including export guarantees. In addition to trade offices in the embassies of importing countries, and export finance information at national chambers of commerce, you can contact any of these international and regional bodies. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) exists to promote world trade, to the benefit of developing countries. Their 'Tradepoint' network, contactable through the UNCTAD's head office, has national offices in many countries with broad-ranging information services. The World Trade Organisation (WTO), although it is often host to uncertainty and controversy at the political level (such as on agricultural products, which it will debate in December 1999), has extensive and helpful advisory services for exporters. Linked to the WTO is the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures Agreement (SPS) applied in cooperation with other international bodies, principally the FAO. The SPS seeks to ensure common standards for food safety and animal and plant health. Large markets The world's largest market for agricultural products is the United States of America, and its import requirements are well-documented by the American Association of Exporters & Importers (AAEI). The second largest market is the European Union, whose fifteen Member States apply common import rules. The fact that it is called a 'single market' hides the fact that the Union contains a great variety of markets, with different consumer tastes and demands. The Centre for the Promotion of Imports from developing countries (CBI) advises both exporters, and European importers. It provides market information, matching programmes, promotion advice in marketing, market surveys, trade documentation, and a far-sighted service on the health, social and environmental demands of the market. It also provides connections to import bodies in each EU member state. Many ACP agricultural exports to Europe are in horticulture, a sector well-promoted by COLEACP, an interprofessional association of exporters, importers and other operators from the ACP-EU industry. COLEACP is {{regarded as one of the}} success stories in ACP-EU cooperation, with many satisfied clients in the promotion of competitive ACP exports of fresh fruit and vegetables, flowers and ornamental plants. It may not last for ever World trade will increasingly be subject to concerns, and perhaps rules, regarding social and environmental issues and a wise exporter will do well to anticipate them. These issues include consumer demand for guarantees about the method of production (such as organic agriculture, absence of child labour, and profit-sharing schemes, often collectively described as 'Fair Trade'), and international demand to reduce energy use in the packaging and shipment of produce, particularly over long distances. Already in Europe there are steps to reduce imports of non-essential products, such as bananas in Norway. And many food packaging plants in ACP countries use heavy materials and technologies that are no longer accepted in the North because of their energy waste. You might think that the world is entering a period of free and frenetic trade. Maybe, but it may not last for long. Several global governance bodies are already preparing for a new wave of restrictions on environmental and energy grounds. A hub in this movement is the United Nations Department for Sustainable Development which can keep you informed, and ahead of most exporters, of forthcoming trends. In the meantime, be informed and trade away. If the big organisations cannot help you promptly and to the extent you want, try this surprising source. The most comprehensive and accessible collection of contact details of import and export agencies all over the world is in the small but enterprising state of El Salvador, in Central America. The Electronic System for Foreign Trade has a trade information service in English and Spanish, open to anybody, by mail or electronic mail.
