The party {{believes that}} regular people should rather decide what good culture is, and demands that artists on public support <b>should</b> <b>offer</b> something the audience wants. It also wants to abolish the annual fee for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation and privatise the company. Otherwise, the party wants to protect and secure Norwegian cultural heritage.|$|E
5|$|Grant's Civil Service Commission {{had limited}} success. Some cabinet members {{implemented}} a merit system that {{increased the number}} of qualified candidates and relied less on Congressional patronage. Delano, however, exempted his department from competitive examinations, and Congress refused to enact permanent Civil Service reform. Zachariah Chandler, who succeeded Delano in 1875, reformed the Interior Department and fired corrupt clerks in the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The same year, Grant fired Attorney General George Henry Williams after his wife was discovered to be involved in a bribery scandal, and appointed reformer Edwards Pierrepont in his place. Grant suggested other reforms as well, including a proposal that states <b>should</b> <b>offer</b> free public schooling to all children; he also endorsed the Blaine Amendment, which would have forbidden government aid to schools with religious affiliations.|$|E

5|$|Thorpe {{was adopted}} as North Devon's Liberal {{candidate}} in April 1952. His political stance matched {{that of other}} young activists, who believed that the party <b>should</b> <b>offer</b> a radical non-socialist alternative to the Conservative government. He and others founded the Radical Reform Group, to drive the party in that direction. He {{spent much of his}} spare time cultivating the voters in North Devon; at rallies and on the doorstep he mixed local concerns with conspicuously liberal views on larger, international issues such as colonialism and apartheid. When Anthony Eden, who had succeeded Winston Churchill as prime minister, called a snap general election in April 1955, Thorpe fought an energetic local campaign. He succeeded in halving the Conservative majority in the constituency, and restoring the Liberals to second place.|$|E

The cartridge is designed for the MP7. This ammunition is optimized for energy transfer in soft targets and <b>should</b> <b>offer</b> good precision. The muzzle velocity V0 and V100 indicate a G1 ballistic coefficient of approximately 0.171 to 0.187 (BC's are somewhat debatable). At the stated effective range of 200m the 2.7g Ball projectile will be travelling at approximately Mach 1.36 (463m/s) under ICAO Standard Atmosphere conditions at sea level (air density ρ=1.225kg/m3).|$|E

The cartridge is designed for the MP7. This ammunition is optimized for energy transfer in soft targets and <b>should</b> <b>offer</b> decent penetration performance on hard and combined targets like car doors or glass and body armour. The muzzle velocity V0 and V50 indicate a G1 ballistic coefficient of approximately 0.112 to 0.119 (BC's are somewhat debatable).

25|$|By a large margin, {{moderation}} had won {{out over}} calls for war. Unlike Western Democrats, most Congressmen—like Polk—did {{not want to}} fight for 54°40′. The Polk administration then made it known that the British government <b>should</b> <b>offer</b> terms to settle the dispute. Despite the cooling diplomatic relations, {{a repeat of the}} War of 1812 was not popular with either nation's government. Time was of the essence, because it was well known that the Peel government would fall with the impending repeal of the Corn Laws in the United Kingdom, and then negotiations would have to begin again with a new ministry. At a time when the European continental balance was a far more pressing problem, a costly war with a major trading partner was not popular with the British government. Aberdeen and McLane quickly worked out a compromise and sent it to the United States.|$|E

25|$|According to simulations, a two-lane {{roundabout}} {{with three}} right turns <b>should</b> <b>offer</b> 12–20% greater traffic flow than a conventional, three-lane roundabout {{of the same}} size. The reason is reduced weaving that makes entering and exiting more predictable. Because there are only ten points of conflict (compared with 8 for a conventional single lane roundabout, or between 32 and 64 with traffic signal control), this design is often safer as well. Research and experiments show that traffic accidents are reduced by 72% on turbo roundabouts compared to multi-lane roundabouts, which have 12 points of conflict. Research at Windesheim University also shows that turbo roundabouts reduce accidents including casualties by some 75% when compared to regular intersections, and by 61% compared to single-lane roundabouts. The same research {{made it very clear}} that it is safer for cyclists not to have priority over motor vehicles on the roundabout, than to have it.|$|E

500|$|Yajnavalkya {{states that}} some people perform the Prajapati ritual when they renounce, but {{this should not be}} done.

He should make the [...] "three-element offering", namely, to [...] "Sattva , Rajas [...] and Tamas [...] " [...] within. He should revere Prana (internal life force) because it is the yoni (womb, birthplace) of all fires. If he cannot obtain this fire, he <b>should</b> <b>offer</b> the oblation [...] "Om!

As he offers this oblation, he should learn that the liberating mantra of Om is the three Vedas and the Brahman to be revered.|$|E
500|$|Benfica started December with a Derby de Lisboa {{game against}} Sporting. They won 3–0, with a first half goal by Van Hooijdonk and two {{goals in a}} five-minute span from João Tomás. Following the win, Mourinho {{requested}} a contract extension as a demonstration {{of faith in the}} work he had put in along with his assistant: [...] "Me [...] and Mozer thought {{that the only way to}} end speculation and the constant threat of being sacked in the event of a bad result...was renewing our contracts for another season." [...] Their proposal was not met. They parted ways with the club through an announcement in a press conference: [...] "He [...] thought it was better not to accept our request. We understood that decision showed a lack of trust in our work, and that we <b>should</b> <b>offer</b> our resignation..." [...] Benfica immediately appointed Toni – a long-time favourite of the President – as the new manager. On 10 December, Benfica played Alverca away from home. They opened the score sheet with a goal from João Tomás close to half-time, but Mantorras equalized. Later, Milinkovic put the Ribatejo side in the lead, resulting in the fourth loss in seven matches in away games for Benfica. In the last match of the year 2000, Benfica met a struggling Gil Vicente, who were at the bottom of the Primeira Liga standings. Unable to unlock the 0–0 draw, the club suffered their eighth winless league game of the season.|$|E
