5|$|Sungei Road (Chinese: 双溪路; {{literally}} River Road) is a road in Singapore situated between Serangoon Road and Jalan Besar {{and runs}} along the Rochor Canal. The area around Sungei Road was formerly the homes of affluent Europeans and Asians, where many ornately designed buildings were built in its place. From the 1930s to the present, the road has been synonymous with the Thieves' Market, the largest and oldest flea market in Singapore, where the locals can hunt for old bric-a-brac or <b>second-hand</b> <b>goods,</b> as a cheap replacement for one's faulty or lost item. It's also {{the place where the}} well-known Sungei Road Laksa, a local spicy noodle soup originated.|$|E
5|$|When news of {{the siege}} reached Spain, Philip IV gave orders to {{assemble}} a relief fleet. <b>Second-hand</b> <b>goods</b> were purchased in the Netherlands and extraordinary levies were carried out across the country. The command of the expedition was entrusted to the Portuguese loyalist Miguel de Noronha, Count of Linhares, who was Captain General of the Galleys of the Mediterranean, and therefore supreme commander of the Spanish naval forces of this sea. He received orders to sail to Orbetello in command of 22 men-of-war of the Silver fleet and the Dunkirk squadron; the later providing 8 frigates. At least 3,300 soldiers were brought aboard these ships for the relief. Linhares' second in command was Admiral General Francisco Díaz de Pimienta, who displeased by his always secondary role, had recently resigned, claiming ill health. While Pimienta would {{be in charge of}} the sailing ships, Linhares would do so with the galleys. Once at sea, the Spanish fleet was joined off the Sardinian Cape Carbonara by 18 galleys from the squadrons of Naples, Sardinia, Genoa, and Sicily, which drove up its strength to 22 galleons and frigates and 30 galleys. Grand Admiral Jean Armand de Maillé-Brézé, Admiral de Maille Brézé, in the meantime, could be reinforced by the divisions of Montade and Saint-Tropez, and was able to oppose Linhares and Pimienta with 24 sailing ships and 20 galleys.|$|E

5000|$|The {{field of}} {{application}} {{of the law of}} value is limited to new output by producers of traded, reproducible labour-products, although it might indirectly influence trade in other goods or assets (for example, the value of a <b>second-hand</b> <b>good</b> may be related to a newly produced good of the same type). Thus, the law does not apply to all goods, services or assets in an economy, and it does not rule the whole economy. In modern Marxism, the law of value is often equated with [...] "market economy", but that was not Marx's own idea. Rather, it limits, regulates and constrains the trade in products. Simply put, the socially necessary labour requirements set limits for the movements of product prices. [...] Primary products are a special case, which Marx discusses in his theory of differential and absolute ground rent. World market prices for primary products can at any time be strongly influenced by the yield of harvests and mines in different countries, regardless of labour effort. There are, besides, various kinds of products which, for one reason or another, are not subject to the law of value (see below).|$|R

We provide a non-technical account of a general equilibrium model that exhibits financially-driven equilibrium cycles. We show that the empirical evidence is widely supportive of the key hypothesis and implications of our approach. We use the model in order to evaluate the effects of several policy measures. It turns out that deepening the market for <b>second-hand</b> capital <b>goods,</b> subsidizing the interest payments of companies which start up when financial conditions are tight, and bailing out some companies in default can indeed 'stabilize' the economy. By way of generalization, we may say that the policy reaction to a financially driven bust should be accommodating...|$|R

25|$|With {{their return}} to Frankfurt a new epoch {{in the history of}} the Jews of that city begins. They were still {{debarred}} from acquiring real estate, but they loaned money, even accepting manuscripts as pledges. The rate of interest, formerly as high as 24 percent, was now reduced to 8 percent. As the unredeemed pledges were sold, traffic in <b>second-hand</b> <b>goods</b> arose, which was further stimulated by the fact that the Jews were not permitted to sell new goods. They were also forbidden to deal in spices, provisions, weapons, cloth, and (from 1634 on) grain. But in spite of these interdictions, their commerce gradually increased. During the Thirty Years' War the Jews fared no worse than their neighbors. In 1694 there were 415 Jewish families; of these, 109 persons were engaged as moneylenders and dealers in second-hand goods; 106 dealt in dry goods, clothes, and trimmings; 24 in spices and provisions; 9 retailed wine and beer; 3 were innkeepers; and 2 had restaurants. Besides these there were the communal officials.|$|E
500|$|Despite its notorious reputation, {{there were}} a few cases of honest and hardworking karung guni men who made good, and became millionaires. One was Poon Buck Seng who started his {{business}} with only a capital of S$50 by picking up junk, or paying small amounts for things people were throwing away in the 1980s. He would then take his goods to sell at the Sungei Road Thieves' Market. Within seven years, he had saved enough money to rent a shop space nearby, and expanded his business to sell bigger used items like computers, refrigerators, videotape recorders and television sets, in addition to old clothes, shoes and records. In 1993, he registered his <b>second-hand</b> <b>goods</b> trading business and began to focus his business in exporting used computer parts, as there were not many people doing that back then, and his business thrived. He made a few thousand dollars every month and five years later, Poon had saved enough money to buy a [...] freehold property worth S$730,000 and was offered S$1.4 million for the unit in a collective sale later. His export business lasted only 10 years. By 2002, Poon's business was declining as too many people had jumped onto the bandwagon. He decided to end his export business and went back to his old karung guni trade again that lasts to this very day.|$|E
2500|$|While it is choices made by {{consumers}} {{that will ultimately}} determine the success of such ventures, there is huge potential for the reuse of goods and materials to deliver social and economic and environmental benefits.

40|$|Environmental {{consequences}} of the high standard of living in developed nations or of the economic engagement of companies based in industrialized countries are often born by the developing countries of the world. In three essays two different aspects of environmental {{consequences of}} North-South Economic Relations are analyzed. The first two essays jointly enhance the existing literature {{on the impact of}} resource extraction, conducted by the North, on the local environment of the South. With the help of a theoretical model the first essay determines South’s local environmental quality {{in the context of a}} resource extraction contract in dependence of the democratic institutions in the host country. The quality of South’s democratic institutions indicate the risk of expropriation as well as the degree to which the South internalizes environmental harm in the model. Meanwhile, the quality extraction technology provided by the North varies in marginal resource extraction costs as well as marginal pollution. Combining these various effects, the theoretical model cannot determine a unique impact of an improvement in democracy on the environment. The consecutive numerical simulation of three distinct cases suggests, however, that despite these contradicting forces environmental quality always benefits from improvements in democracy. The empirical investigation of the second paper supports this finding by showing that the level of the host country’s democracy determines the extent of deforestation associated with oil drilling in a global cross-country comparison. The study reveals vast differences across countries in the amount of forest clearance due to oil drilling in the closest vicinity to oil wells. Making use of a quasi-natural experiment, difference-in-difference regressions identify the level of democracy as determining factor for the degree of deforestation due to oil drilling. While the discovery of oil in countries with high democracy scores is associated with clearance of 35 % of the immediate vicinity of an oil well within ten years, the clearance of the forests is twice as high in countries with low democracy scores. Interestingly, the level of forest clearance does neither differ systematically with the type of the operating company nor with the democracy score of the operating company's home country. Furthermore, income per capita in the oil country does not seem to be the driving force behind the cross-country variance. In the third essay, trade flows of <b>second-hand</b> electronic <b>goods</b> directed from the North to the South are detected and the consequential energy consumption is estimated. The essay provides descriptive statistics which make the case of industrialized countries exporting lower valued electronic goods to developing countries. Supported by anecdotal evidence, this suggests that <b>second-hand</b> electronic <b>goods</b> are exported to the global South. Applying two-stage-least squares regressions with a gravity equation instrumenting for trade volumes in the first stage, a subsequent increase in the consumer group is found to be statistically significant for African countries leading to an overall increase in worldwide energy consumption...|$|R
