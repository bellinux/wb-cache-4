5|$|The party's ski boots, {{specially}} designed by Amundsen, were {{the product of}} two years' testing and modification in search of perfection. The party's polar clothing included suits of sealskin from Northern Greenland, and clothes fashioned after {{the style of the}} Netsilik Inuit from reindeer skins, wolf skin, Burberry cloth and gabardine. The sledges were constructed from Norwegian ash with steel-shod runners made from American hickory. Skis, also fashioned from hickory, were extra long to reduce the likelihood of slipping into crevasses. The tents—"the strongest and most practical that have ever been used"—had built-in floors and required a <b>single</b> <b>pole.</b> For cooking on the march, Amundsen chose the Swedish Primus stove rather than the special cooker devised by Nansen, because he felt the latter took up too much space.|$|E

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of a renormalized {{field theory}} under scale transformations x to lambda x; p to p/ lambda {{can be found}} in a simple way when the theory is regularized by the continuous dimension method. The techniques proposed have several applications in dimensionally regularized theories: short distance behaviour is expressed in terms of the <b>single</b> <b>poles</b> at n= 4, and all coefficients in front of the higher poles 1 /(n- 4) /sup k/ are expressed in terms of those of the <b>single</b> <b>poles</b> 1 /(n- 4), without calculating any diagram. In some cases the Taylor series in 1 /(n- 4) can be summed, leading to some exact results for the infinities of the full theory. (7 refs) ...|$|R

25|$|When the {{open-loop}} gain has several poles, {{rather than the}} <b>single</b> <b>pole</b> of the above example, feedback can result in complex poles (real and imaginary parts). In a two-pole case, the result is peaking in the frequency response of the feedback amplifier near its corner frequency and ringing and overshoot in its step response. In the case {{of more than two}} poles, the feedback amplifier can become unstable and oscillate. See the discussion of gain margin and phase margin. For a complete discussion, see Sansen.|$|E

500|$|Ski poles {{are used}} for balance and propulsion. Modern {{cross-country}} ski poles are made from aluminium, fibreglass-reinforced plastic, or carbon fibre, depending on weight, cost and performance parameters. Formerly {{they were made of}} wood or bamboo. [...] They feature a foot (called a basket) {{near the end of the}} shaft that provides a pushing platform, as it makes contact with the snow. Baskets vary in size, according to the expected softness/firmness of the snow. Racing poles feature smaller, lighter baskets than recreational poles. Poles designed for skating are longer than those designed for classic skiing. Traditional skiing in the 1800s used a <b>single</b> <b>pole</b> for both cross-country and downhill. The <b>single</b> <b>pole</b> was longer and stronger than the poles that are used in pairs. In competitive cross-country poles in pairs were introduced around 1900.|$|E

500|$|Two {{plans for}} modernizing the ship were put forward before World War I. In 1907 the Naval General Staff {{proposed}} a major reconstruction {{aimed at reducing}} her draft and raising her armor belt higher out of the water. Her above-water torpedo tubes, torpedo nets, auxiliary boilers and 47-millimeter guns would have been removed, her superstructure cut down and her rigging reduced to a <b>single</b> <b>pole</b> mast. These changes would have reduced her displacement by , but the plan was rejected due to a shortage of money. Her above-water torpedo tubes, however, were removed about this time. In 1912 {{the staff of the}} Black Sea Fleet proposed to replace all of her 47mm guns with four [...] guns and to remove the auxiliary boilers and the submerged torpedo tubes to offset the additional weight. The Naval General Staff did not think that this was worth the cost and rejected the plan. Even though these plans did not come to fruition, other alterations were made to Rostislav before the war. A dozen of her 37mm guns were removed in 1906, and she was fitted with [...] rangefinders, probably made by Barr and Stroud, in 1907 and 1908.|$|E
