40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{model is}} used to study the pressure distribution in a chamber of a spinneret system. Darcyâ€™s law is adopted for determining the inlet and outlet velocities of the flow. The pressure distribution on the <b>spinneret</b> <b>plate</b> is obtained, and the dead zone, where no nozzle exists, can be optimally determined...|$|E
40|$|Silk {{production}} from opisthosomal glands is a {{defining characteristic of}} spiders (Araneae). Silk emerges from spigots (modified setae) borne on spinnerets (modified appendages). Spigots from _Attercopus fimbriunguis_ (Shear, Selden &#x 26; Rolfe, 1987 ^ 1 ^), from Middle Devonian (386 Ma) strata of Gilboa, New York were described in 1989 ^ 2 ^ as evidence for the oldest spider and the first use of silk by animals. Slightly younger (374 Ma) material from South Mountain, New York, conspecific with _A. fimbriunguis_, includes spigots and other evidence which elucidate the evolution of early Araneae and the origin of spider silk. No known _Attercopus_ spigots, including the original specimen^ 2 ^, occur on true spinnerets but are arranged {{along the edges of}} <b>plates.</b> <b>Spinnerets</b> originated from biramous appendages of opisthosomal somites 4 and 5; while present in _Limulus_, no other arachnids have opisthosomal appendage homologues on these segments. The spigot arrangement in _Attercopus_ shows a primitive state prior to the re-expression of the dormant genetic mechanism which gave rise to spinnerets in later spiders. The inability of _Attercopus_ precisely to control silk weaving suggests its original use as a wrapping, lining or homing material...|$|R
40|$|The Atlantic guitarfish, Rhinobatos lentiginosus, is {{characterized}} by aplacental yolk sac viviparity. Modifications of the female reproductive tract support this form of development in which embryos depend exclusively on yolk sac contents for nutrition throughout gestation. The uterus {{is characterized}} by rich vascularization. Uterine epithelium is cuboidal except atop the luminal vessels where it changes to simple squamous. This arrangement reduces the diffusion distance for gas exchange. Two layers of smooth muscle, an interior circular and an outer longitudinal layer make up {{the wall of the}} uterus. Jelly coats and the egg envelope that surround the fertilized egg are produced by the oviducal gland (OG). Later in gestation, embryos eclose (hatch) from the egg envelope to complete development free in the uterus. The uterus does not contribute any supplemental nutrients to augment the yolk stores. Longitudinal folds covered in simple columnar ciliated epithelium, except {{at the base of the}} folds where secretory columnar cells populate the crypt, characterize the oviduct. Club, papillary, baffle and terminal zones comprise the OG. Club and papillary zones produce various components of the egg jelly. The club zone provides the jelly immediately surrounding the egg and the papillary zone adds additional jelly components. Secretory cells of the club and papillary zones contain strongly PAS+ granules. The baffle zone comprises the majority of the gland and produces the egg envelope. Simple tubular baffle zone glands empty their secretions to secretory ducts that are confluent with the spinneret. Two adjacent semicircular baffle plates covered with cilia comprise the spinneret. As secretory product passes through the <b>spinneret,</b> the baffle <b>plates</b> deflect the flow to create the various layers of the egg envelope, each with slightly different orientations to create a plyboard type of laminate. Baffle zone secretory granules are PAS-. The terminal zone lacks deep tubules and has secretory crypts. Sperm are not observed in the OG...|$|R
