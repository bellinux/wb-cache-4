25|$|The {{holdings}} of western Atlantic reef fishes {{are among the}} most important in existence, with the following geographic areas most heavily collected: Florida, the Bahamas, Isla de Providencia, the Cayman Islands, the Virgin Islands and the Lesser Antilles. Smaller numbers of reef fish collections exist from Puerto Rico, Jamaica, Sombrero Island, other Lesser Antilles islands, continental islands off northern South America, Brazil, and Ascension Island. There are a substantial number of reef fishes from off the Carolinas. Major reef groups represented include the Acanthuridae, Antenariidae, Apogonidae, Blenniidae, Chaenopsidae, Chaetodontidae, Clinidae, Dactyloscopidae, Gobiesocidae, Gobiidae, Grammistidae, Haemulidae, Holocentridae, Kyphosidae, Labridae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Muraenidae, Ostraciidae, Opistognathidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, <b>Scaridae,</b> Serranidae, and Tripterygidae. Eastern Pacific reef collections are present from the Pearl Islands south to Ecuador. Also available are a fair number of Indo-Pacific reef fishes acquired by staff collecting and by donations received from the Bishop Museum and the National Museum of Natural History. Over 200 shore and estuarine collections have been made from the Caribbean coasts of Costa Rica and Panama.|$|E
25|$|The giant {{trevally}} is {{a powerful}} predatory fish, from the estuaries it inhabits as a juvenile to the outer reefs and atolls it patrols as an adult. Hunting appears to occur {{at different times of}} the day in different areas of its range; off South Africa it is most active during the day, especially at dawn and dusk, while off Zanzibar and Hong Kong, it is nocturnal in its habits. The species' diets have been determined in several countries and habitats; their diets generally vary slightly by locations and age. In all but one study (which was of juveniles), the giant trevally dominantly takes other fishes, with various crustaceans, cephalopods and occasionally molluscs making the remainder of the diet. In Hawaii, the species has a predominantly fish-based diet consisting of <b>Scaridae</b> and Labridae, with crustaceans, including lobsters, and cephalopods (squid and octopus) making up the remaining portion. The large number of reef fishes suggests it spends much of its time foraging over shallow-water reef habitats, but the presence of squid and the schooling carangid Decapterus macarellus indicates exploitation of more open-water habitats, as well. Off Africa, the diet is similar, consisting mostly of fish including eels, with minor squid, octopus, mantis shrimp, lobsters and other crustaceans. Younger fish inside Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii showed the only instance where crustaceans were preferred over fish; stomatopods, shrimp and crabs were the most common prey taken at 89% of stomach content by volume, with fish, mostly of the family Blennidae, making up only 7% of the stomach contents. Estuarine fish in both Hawaii and Australia have mostly fish-based diets, with crustaceans such as prawns and amphipods also of importance, and they are known to take more novel prey, such as spiders and insects, in these habitats. Juvenile turtles and dolphins were reported being found within the stomach contents of larger giant trevally. Studies of different size classes of fish have found their diets change with age in some locations, with the changes relating to an increased volume of fish taken.|$|E
2500|$|The bluefin {{trevally}} is a fast swimming, mainly piscivorous predator {{which shows}} {{a wide range}} in hunting techniques. Two studies of adult fish in Hawaii found fish to be the dominant food type in the species, making up over 95% volume of the stomach contents by weight. Here the main fish selected were small reef dwellers, with fish from the families Labridae, Mullidae, <b>Scaridae</b> and Priacanthidae being the most common. Despite the preference of several families, bluefin trevally do take a very wide variety of fish in small amounts, including various species of eel.

50|$|Parrotfishes are a {{group of}} about 95 species {{traditionally}} regarded as a family (<b>Scaridae),</b> but now often considered a subfamily (Scarinae) of the wrasses.

50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that coral trout in the {{southern}} Great Barrier Reef feed mainly on parrot fish (family <b>Scaridae)</b> and hardyhead bait fish (family Atherinidae). The most common prey items further north are the damselfish (Pomacentridae) and fusiliers or banana fish (Caesionidae). One study showed coral trout eating schools of fusilers in summer, and scarids during the winter months. This seasonal variation is quite common in the diet of coral trout due to varying abundances of prey {{at different times of}} the year. Trout also tend to eat more food in winter, possibly to increase fat stores in preparation for reproduction in spring.|$|E
50|$|Roi feed {{primarily}} on juvenile fish that have recruited the reef. The family of fish {{that make up}} the majority of their diet <b>Scaridae</b> or Parrotfish, are crucial to the coral reef ecosystem by removing algal growth on coral colonies through feeding. Parrotfish also play a large role in the production of sand. Hawaii has the highest rate of endemism of its nearshore marine fish species at 24.3%. The lack of natural predators to control Roi populations along with their high efficiency is a major threat to the unique fish fauna found in Hawaii. Ichtyologist, Dr. Jack Randall, describes the impact of Roi in Hawaii as greater than the impact of fishing and aquarium collection combined. Estimates of consumption on the Kona coast suggest that Roi consume 11% of the total reef fish biomass and 72% {{of the total number of}} fish.|$|E

5000|$|The STXEEMP {{encompasses}} seagrass meadows, shallow-water linear {{coral reefs}} (<10m), mid water (>10 m) patch coral reefs and deep mesophotic coral reefs (>30m). The shoreline boundaries of STXEEMP include numerous beaches, salt ponds and mangrove habitats. Great Pond, {{located at the}} southwestern shoreline boundary, {{is one of the}} largest remaining mangrove tracts on the island. The seagrass meadows (principally composed of the seagrass species Thalassia testudinum and Syringodium filiforme) provide nursery and foraging areas for a variety of species of reef fish, stingrays, conch and other invertebrates. [...] Seagrass beds also serve to anchor sand, and retain nutrients and sediment that wash down from the land. [...] Reefs provide shelter and foraging habitat for reef species, many of which are commercially important, either as a tourist attraction, a fishery or both. [...] Mangroves serve as nurseries and shelter for juvenile fish, a catchment and filter for runoff and sediments, and provide critical shoreline protection from strong weather events. [...] The mangrove habitat of Great Pond in particular also supports a large diversity of wintering shorebirds, and nesting habitat for resident species such as Least Tern Sterna antillarum, White-crowned Pigeons Patagioenas leucocephala (IUCN Near Threatened), Green-throated Carib Eulampis holosericeus, and a diversity of heron, egret and shorebird species.

In Hawaii, crustaceans make up 96% of the gut contents numerically, with tanaids and isopods dominating the diet, while fish (mainly gobioids) only make up 4% numerically. Juveniles less than 170 mm in South African estuaries feed predominantly on mysids and paenid prawns, before shifting to a more fish based diet at larger sizes. Small fish are able to effectively filter these small crustaceans from the water, while adults are not. In both cases, a transition to a more fish based diet with age was found to occur, although the length at which this transition occurred varied between location. The diet overlap with the similar C. ignobilis is low in the Hawaiian Islands, suggesting there is some separation of feeding niches. [...] Calculations suggest each individual bluefin trevally consumes around 45 kg of fish per year on average, {{making it one of the}} most effective predators in this habitat.|$|E

40|$|At a {{fundamental}} level, spatial {{variation in the}} abundance and community structure of scleractinian corals must be influenced by patterns of larval settlement. However, spatial variation in early post-settlement mortality {{has the potential to}} greatly distort patterns established at settlement, and the relative influence of variation in settlement rates and post-settlement processes on spatial dynamics of coral assemblages remains largely unknown. In this study, spatial variation in mortality of recruits (< 3 months of age) and juvenile corals (< 5 cm in diameter; ~ 1 - 4 years of age) was quantified in three depth zones at each of three locations and round Moorea, French Polynesia. Mortality of coral recruits was extremely variable and particularly high (50 % in 7 days), and is associated with the abundance of parrotfishes (Fam. <b>Scaridae).</b> Juvenile mortality was less intense (up to 40 % in 14 months), but also shows strong spatial variability, corresponding with variation in abundance of butterflyfishes (Fam. Chaetodontidae). Spatial variability in early post-settlement mortality partly accounts for apparent differences in the abundance of coral recruits versus juveniles corals, highlighting the potential importance of post-settlement processes as a driver of spatial variation in the dynamics of coral assemblages. Moreover, variation in early-post settlement mortality of corals appears to be influenced mainly by local densities of <b>Scaridae</b> and Chaetodontidae, which each affect a different stage in the life-cycle (recruits versus juvenile corals, respectively) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} novel method for calculating the {{opportunity}} costs to fishers from their displacement by {{the establishment of}} marine protected areas (MPAs). We used a fishing community in Kubulau District, Fiji to demonstrate this method. We modelled opportunity costs {{as a function of}} food fish abundance and probability of catch, based on gear type and market value of species. Count models (including Poisson, negative binomial and two zero-inflated models) were used to predict spatial abundance of preferred target fish species and were validated against field surveys. A profit model was used to investigate the effect of restricted access to transport on costs to fishers. Spatial distributions of fish within the three most frequently sighted food fish families (Acanthuridae, Lutjanidae, <b>Scaridae)</b> varied, with greatest densities of Lutjanidae and Acanthuridae on barrier forereefs and greatest densities of <b>Scaridae</b> on submerged reefs. Modelled opportunity cost indicated that highest costs to fishers arise from restricting access to the barrier forereefs. We included our opportunity cost model in Marxan, a decision support tool used for MPA design, to examine potential MPA configurations for Kubulau District, Fiji Islands. We identified optimum areas for protection in Kubulau with: (a) the current MPA network locked in place; and (b) a clean-slate approach. Our method of modelling opportunity cost gives an unbiased estimate for multiple gear types in a marine environment and can be applied to other regions using existing species data.
