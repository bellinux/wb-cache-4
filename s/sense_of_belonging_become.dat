Another point worth mentioning concerns the economic dimension, with the practice prevailing in reciprocity marketing. The research leads to the fact that training and practices that strengthen the sociopolitical dimension (knowledge, empowerment, a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging)</b> <b>become</b> the guiding principle for the strengthening of the social management in the context of other dimensions, leading to gains sociopolitical, economic, organizational and environmental.

40|$|In {{precarious}} environments, such as squatter settlements, sustainability can {{be achieved}} as an economic resource. It is important, however, to start with assuring a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> in {{the members of the}} communities. Through observation in squatter settlements and conversations with their inhabitants, this paper presents a view on informal sustainability through participative processes. We argue that if we begin by looking at cultural sustainability, people’s <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> <b>becomes</b> a key factor in taking care of the environment. We aim to demonstrate that even if squatter settlements are regarded as areas of conflict in terms of pollution, occupation of the land, and waste disposal, through informal processes people can achieve a degree of awareness that will not only result in sustainable practices, but that can also propose new creative ways to achieve them, with economical considerations in mind...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> has <b>become</b> a {{critical}} issue that provokes intense discussion among diasporic authors. Struggling for a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging,</b> closely associated with issues of history, memory, and borders, reflects the colonized people’s current dilemma. In Amitav Ghosh’s The Shadow Lines, borders considered to be “shadow lines”, influence the individual and community.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} links between {{belonging}} and ethics, which remain largely underdeveloped in project studies and are overlooked in everyday practice of managing projects. It focuses on belonging as the process articulating identity-construction of an inter-organisational project team from a global management consulting firm that was working in IS design. As the team?s experienced ?<b>sense</b> <b>of</b> place?, <b>belonging</b> <b>becomes</b> the space which highlights preferred affiliations and exposes how ? individually and collectively ? ethics are {{played out in the}} context of the management of projects. Four in situ belonging-narratives (of opposition, pragmatism, reflexivity, and the habitual narrative) represent ethics as part of lived action and of a life-world that emerge from deconstructing and reconstructing ?the team? and an ideal worker in projects. The team?s struggles to ?fit in? were experienced both when resisting and when collaborating with the dominant collective narrative <b>of</b> <b>belonging.</b> Modes <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> are constituted in the relationship between self, others, and ?otherness?, creating a situated ethical imagination of how to ?be professional?. Implications concern the politics <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> and call for a renewed practical ethics that engages with the social nature of ?being?, to change the current view of professional identities in projects...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{employs a}} post-anarchist {{influenced}} lens and develops a collective capacity framework {{in order to}} explore how the media consumption and production practices of the Chinese Canadian, Latin American, and Somali Canadian communities in Ottawa, Canada, can strengthen these communities’ ability to facilitate {{the process by which}} immigrants become community members and form a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> in Ottawa. The thesis explores both how ethno-cultural media can help newcomers to form a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> and <b>become</b> part <b>of</b> a local ethno-cultural community, as well as how such media can help members of minority ethno-cultural communities become part of the broader local community and to form a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> in Ottawa, and Canada more broadly. Throughout, the thesis identifies and explores the differences that emerge between the three communities in order to gain better insight into the potential benefits of ethno-cultural media. In order to explore and to answer these questions, the thesis employs quantitative and qualitative methods. It relies on analysis of secondary literature, raw data from the OMMI 2012 Survey, raw content coding of local Chinese and Spanish language media carried out as part of the Ottawa Multicultural Media Initiative, and primary research consisting of content coding of a Somali Canadian television program. The main contribution of this thesis lies in offering a new lens through which to assess the integrative potential of ethno-cultural media. Approaching the question from a bottom-up, relationship-centred perspective has yielded different findings than those generally reported in Canadian ethno-cultural media research. Although there were significant differences in terms of media use and media production between the three communities, the findings revealed that all three used ethno-cultural media in ways that had the potential to help them in the process of settling down and taking root in a new city, and of helping them to form a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging...</b>|$|R

Belonging is a basic human need that has to be met before certain other needs, such as self-actualisation and self-esteem, can be fulfilled (Erikson, 1969 : 238; Maslow, 1970 : 43; Max-Neef, 1991 : 33). A lack <b>of</b> a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> leads to feelings of rejection, loneliness and an inability to engage in future relationships (Ding & Littleton, 2005 :i). Children who do not experience this <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> can easily <b>become</b> involved in gangster activities, promiscuity or substance dependence in order to secure a false <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> (Brendtro, Brokenleg & Van Bockern, 2002 : 9). Ideally, this need for belonging should be fulfilled within the primary family situation. However, the reality is that many children in South Africa do not live in what is generally regarded as the primary family, namely a family with two parents (Holborn & Eddy, 2011 : 1), but come from fractured families.

40|$|The {{transition}} from childhood to adulthood {{is a major}} one, {{not only for the}} individual but the society at large. In some societies, the rites of passage are observed to usher young people into adulthood. The Krobos in Ghana are no exception. They have the most elaborate puberty rites for girls in Ghana today. This study investigates the historical background of the practice, the changes it has undergone and reasons for these changes. The ways in which this practice forms part of the ethnic identity of the Krobos and more importantly, a Krobo woman is explored. The study draws on concepts such as gender, values, modernization, and ethnicity. The study reveals that the practice was a form of vocational training for young women in which they were taught generally how to assume their roles as responsible women in the society. Changes observed in the rite serve to ensure its continuity. The custom is adept with symbols, the major one being that initiates are transformed into women. The study shows that the custom is a means of female empowerment in a patrilineal society as it is aimed at bringing females into the limelight. People adhere to the practice mainly because it is tradition and the desire to have a place in their family home in Kroboland. The deep <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> therefore <b>becomes</b> part <b>of</b> the motivation to engage in the practice. Christianity and modernization are however factors that make people refrain from the practice. The practice was however described as a rich custom and an ethnic hallmark of the Krobos...|$|R

It is, in particular, critical for people of diaspora because their place of living differs from that of origin. Drawing on an analysis of one of the largest online Korean diaspora communities in the United States (www.

This study illustrates how they respond to the news of two countries and intends to determine how their news consumption patterns reflect the diaspora members’ cultural identity. While diaspora members mainly consume Korean media and communicate in Korean, they sustain a more positive attitude toward the U. S. than Korea. This study demonstrates that digital diasporic members’ cultural identity cannot be fixed or inclined toward a specific country. Rather, it tends to vacillate between the two nations with which they identify and enhance a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belongingness within their diasporic community...|$|R

There is also extensive evidence regarding variation <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> among minority groups and the important role of teachers in creating a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> for students. This study found that there is no significant difference in students? reported <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> between high-performing schools and low-performing schools on the Psychological <b>Sense</b> <b>of</b> School Membership scale. There is a significant difference between the teachers? perception <b>of</b> the students? <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> and the students? reported <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> on the Psychological <b>Sense</b> <b>of</b> School Membership scales.

The variables assessed in relationship to <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> include cross-racial peer interaction, encouragement from family and friends, and campus involvement. Driving distance was also assessed in relationship to <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> and campus involvement. Additionally, the relationship between <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> and institutional commitment was explored. Two-hundred and four first year, commuter students completed an online survey consisting of demographic background questions, and four previously validated scales that measured frequency of cross-racial interactions, encouragement from friends and family, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> and institutional commitment. Activity involvement was measured using ten individual campus activities items. The results identified all three variables, campus activities, cross-racial interactions, and encouragement of family and friends, as predictors <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> in first year commuter students. The assessment of the effects of participation in specific campus activities on <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> resulted in community service clubs and organizations having the greatest impact on <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging.</b> Commute distance appeared to affect <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> and campus involvement negatively.

Methods Data were used from two waves of the Dutch internet cohort LISS (Longitudinal Internet Studies of the Social Sciences; N = 511, M age = 52. 09 years). Social inhibition was measured using the DS 14 in 2012, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> (i. e., feeling cut off and having people to really talk to) was measured with the General Social Exclusion Index in 2012 and internalizing problems with the MHI- 5 in 2015. Results Social inhibition was related to a lower <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> and more internalizing problems. A low <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> was related to more internalizing problems. Results indicated no moderation. However, evidence was found for partial mediation. That is, feeling cut off and having people to really talk to explained part of the link between social inhibition and internalizing problems. All analyses were controlled for sex, age and income. Limitations The items used to measure <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> only cover part of the construct.

One concern is that many immigrants and ethnic minorities are not integrating into the receiving societies, which is thought to undermine a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> to the nation. In this paper, I question whether this fear is valid by exploring the relationship between the individual and society through the notion of ‘sense of belonging’ - to a community, to a polity and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> to the nation.

There are other factors affecting one’s <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging.</b> In the unique political situation of Hong Kong, the analysis shows that ‘family’ is the most significant element in anchoring the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> <b>of</b> the low-income group. However, the findings also confirmed that home ownership would bring societal benefits in fostering a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> among the public as well as to bring neighbourhood stability through homeowners’ social participation and attachment to the local community. Both the PRH tenants and HOS owners indicated home-owing being their preferred housing tenure. Despite that there are many respondents viewed that the societal benefits from home ownership may also be achieved in the public rental housing estates, they agreed that the Government should offer subsidies to the Hong Kong people to assist them in acquiring home ownership in the form of HOS. It is justified that the Hong Kong Government will re-launch the HOS in the near future to realise the aspiration of home ownership of the low-income people and the young generation in view of the incredibly high housing prices which are far beyond their housing affordability. It is also observed that the public rental housing estates did offer a stable community to the PRH tenants who rated an admirable score <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> to Hong Kong. To promote <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging,</b> provision <b>of</b> more housing rental flats to low-income people is strongly recommended. published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|R

40|$|The primary aim of {{this study}} was to examine student {{perceptions}} <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging,</b> peer support, and student social media use and how these factors influence their mental health, overall well-being, and confidence regarding their transition to work after graduation (i. e., school-to-work efficacy). A second aim was to examine the role of social media use on <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging,</b> peer support, and mental health. A third and final aim was to examine the above-mentioned variables in the context of co-operative education (co-op). Participants, undergraduate students (n= 314) from all years of study and all academic faculties completed an online survey which included demographic information as well as measures <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging,</b> mental health status, social connections and peer support systems, social media usage, perceived mental preparedness for the transition to work, and perceived importance of peer support and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> on mental health and overall wellbeing. The results of this study revealed a number of important findings related to the relationships between <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging,</b> peer support, and social media on school to work transitions and indicators of mental health and well-being. It was shown that student’s perceived <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> to their peers and the university community and access to high quality peer support were strongly related to their overall mental health and well-being. Demographic factors were also found to be significantly related to <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging,</b> peer support, and confidence in school to work transitions, and students who participate in co-operative education were shown to have higher levels of school to work efficacy than non-co-op peers. The results revealed that students who reported a strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> to school and peers were more likely to report experiencing greater emotional stability and that students who experienced a stronger <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> appraisal and <b>belonging</b> support within the campus community were more likely to report that they experienced better levels of mental balance and happiness. It was also found that while students perceived social media as playing an important role in their perceived <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> and peer support, a high intensity of social media use was related to lower emotional stability in students.

30|$|Peer {{interactions}} and interpersonal relationships have significant impacts on <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> {{and are often}} seen as the most critical factor for overall <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> (Johnson 2012). For example, engagement in peer discussions outside of the classroom was shown to {{increase the likelihood of}} women persisting in STEM (Espinosa 2011). Women of color, in particular, are highly influenced by the presence of peer relationships (Espinosa 2011; Weidman, 1989) and peer support overall (Espinosa 2011; Meiners et al. 2004; Shain 2002; Valenzuela 2006). Other factors have been shown to enhance students’ <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging,</b> and many <b>of</b> these have disproportionate effects on underrepresented students. For example, multiple academic and environmental interventions have been shown to improve women’s and minorities’ <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> (Ramsey et al. 2013; Smith et al. 2013; Walton and Cohen 2011).|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Lack <b>of</b> a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> {{has been}} shown to be {{associated}} with loneliness, emotional distress, psychosocial disturbance, and mental illness. Conversely, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> was found to correspond with psychosocial health. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the buffering effect <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> against the development of depression. STUDY DESIGN: This study used a comparative design. The sample consisted of 443 Navy recruits in basic training who were divided into depressed and control groups based on depressive symptoms. The groups were then further stratified based on risk factors: a personal history of abuse and family histories of mental illness, alcohol, and drug abuse. RESULTS: The results refuted a significant buffering effect <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> against the development of depressive symptoms in several of the subgroups. However, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> significantly buffered those with a family history of alcohol abuse against developing depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: <b>Sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> is a concept that has important implications for psychosocial well being. Interventions that enhance <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> will be useful in the treatment and primary prevention of depression. (J Am Psychiatr Nurses Assoc [2002]. 8, 120 - 9.) Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a serious men-tal health issue that impacts many Americans. Cur-rent estimates suggest a lifetime prevalence rate for MDD of between 10 % and 25 % (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). MDD has been called the “common cold ” of mental illness. An estimated $ 16 billion is spent in the United States per year in an effort to alleviate the suffering and to develop new treatments (Depressio...|$|R
