A steel blade or split leg bone {{can be used for}} a scraper. The hide is draped on the log, the person leans into it, holding the hide in place with their body and pushing the scraper away with both hands.

40|$|Amino-functional {{silicone}} softeners {{are most}} widely used type of <b>soft</b> <b>finishes</b> owing to their outstanding permanent softness, smoothness and handle characteristics. These <b>soft</b> <b>finishes</b> are prepared in different emulsion droplet sizes such as macro and micro emulsions providing varying characteristics on the textile on which they are applied. The macroemulsions due to their larger droplet sizes lubricate fabric and yarn surfaces, while the micro-emulsion, thanks to their smaller sizes penetrate inside fiber pores. In this research amino-functional macro and micro emulsions have been applied on dyed cotton fabric in 1 : 1 combination and compared against their influence on physical properties such as bending length, abrasion resistance, tensile strength, crease resistance and water repellency. These emulsions have also been compared for their influence on colorimetric properties; color difference and color strength (K/S values). The results reveal that the softener`s application in combination improves the properties deteriorated by each softener when applied separatel...|$|R

Wood itself is considered to be hypo-allergenic and its smooth surfaces prevent the buildup of particles common in <b>soft</b> <b>finishes</b> like carpet. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of American recommends hardwood, vinyl, linoleum tile or slate flooring instead of carpet. The use of wood products can also improve air quality by absorbing or releasing moisture in the air to moderate humidity.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{its high}} {{economical}} efficiency, the gear shaving {{process is a}} widely used process for <b>soft</b> <b>finishing</b> of gears in the gear manufacturing industry. However, because of highly increased efficiency, other gear finishing processes, especially gear hobbing, have recently become competitive with the shaving process for <b>soft</b> <b>finishing</b> of gears. In contrast to other machining processes with geometrically defined cutting edges, the gear shaving process has been improved little during the past 30 years. So far, {{it is not known}} if the machining parameters in gear shaving represent an optimum as they are or if there is a potential for further optimization. Therefore, in this report, different approaches to increase the tool life and the productivity are discussed, using different simulation techniques. At first, a geometrical simulation tool based on penetration calculation is used in order to analyze the geometrical and kinematical conditions of the gear shaving process. The information gained by this type of analysis is used to create another simulation model which is based on FEA. This two-dimensional model allows the determination of physical values like stresses, forces, temperatures and others. Also, with this type of simulation, it is possible to determine the effect of tool wear on the chip creation process. The information gained with the two different simulation techniques is subsequently used to find different approaches to optimize the gear shaving process...|$|R

40|$|The ofrr has significantty revised its school design bulletin. At the launch, design teams used it {{to explore}} {{low-energy}} design options Ed ucation a [envi ron m ents BY SEBASTIAN MACMILLAN, NICK BAKER AND MICHAEL BUCKLEY The desire to create a stimulating, light, sunny, spacious and airy inte-rior is a longstanding goal ofschool design. Victorian schools were notabie for tall windows and high ceilings. In the 1980 s several schools in Hampshire and elsewhere attempted to use solar gains for heating, {{with varying degrees of}} success. Exploiting direct solar gain requires not only south-facing glaz-ing but also that room surfaces, especially floors which recelve direct insolation, are of sufficiently high thermal admittance to absorb the solar gains and avoid overheat-ing. These last requirements are not always compatible with <b>soft</b> <b>finishes</b> needed for acoustic reasons. In addition, excessive areas of glazing even when they are south-facing can lead to local cold radiant effects and glare. Glazed streets or atria can pro-vide valuable circulation space if unheated; but heating them to full comfort temperature as teaching space can turn them into an energy penalty. With attached sun-spaces, occupants must take action such as opening the dividing windows or doors to benefit from the solar-heated air when it is available, and the opposite when gains cease so as to avoid reverse flow. Sun-spaces, iike glazed streets, reduce the avail-ability of both natural ventilation and daylight to the rooms to which they are attached. In the 1990 s higher ievels of insulation and double glazing have become the norm. Fabric heat losses have reduced, so ventilation losses have become relatively more signifi-cant. Concern about indoor air quality has focused attention on adequate ventilation rates to dilute internal pollutants. There is also greater awareness of the cost to th...|$|R

25|$|<b>Soft</b> hammer <b>finished</b> {{pieces are}} usually balanced, {{symmetrical}} {{and can be}} relatively smooth. Soft hammer works {{first appeared in the}} Acheulean period, allowing tools with these markings {{to be used as a}} post quem estimation, but with no greater precision. The main advantage of a soft hammer is that a flintknapper is able to remove broader, thinner flakes with barely developed heels, which allows a cutting edge to be maintained or even improved with minimal raw material wastage. However, a high-quality raw material is required to make their use effective. No studies compare the two methods in terms of yield per unit weight of raw material, or the difference in energy use. The use of a soft hammer requires greater use of force by the flintknapper and a steeper learning curve, although it offers more flakes for less raw material.|$|R
