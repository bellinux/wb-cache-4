5|$|The chief complaint, and {{the onset}} of the complaint, are usually {{important}} in the diagnosis of toothache. For example, the key distinction between reversible and irreversible pulpitis is given in the history, such as pain following a stimulus in the former, and lingering pain following a <b>stimulus</b> <b>and</b> spontaneous pain in the latter. History is also important in recent filling or other dental treatment, and trauma to the teeth. Based on the most common causes of toothache (dentin hypersensitivity, periodontitis, and pulpitis), the key indicators become localization of the pain (whether the pain is perceived as originating in a specific tooth), thermal sensitivity, pain on biting, spontaneity of the pain, and factors that make the pain worse.The various qualities of the toothache, such as the effect of biting and chewing on the pain, the effect of thermal stimuli, and the effect of the pain on sleep, are verbally established by the clinician, usually in a systematic fashion, such as using the Socrates pain assessment method (see table).|$|E

40|$|For both {{survival}} and procreation, animals must facilitate behavior {{that results in}} beneficial outcomes, and inhibit behavior that results in harmful outcomes. Inherent to this process {{is the ability of}} animals to predict probable outcomes that are associated with <b>stimuli</b> <b>and</b> behavior. Neurons in reward-related brain structures respond to <b>stimuli</b> <b>and</b> behavior in a manner that reflects the probable outcomes that are associated with those <b>stimuli</b> <b>and</b> behavior. Although these responses have been characterized in prior research, one issue has received relatively little attention: Outcomes depend on more than <b>stimuli</b> <b>and</b> behavior alone. Outcomes also depend on long-lasting aspects of the animals state, including context, physiological states, and emotional states. It is not clear how such state-dependent information is represented in reward circuitry. The main focus of this thesis was to investigate this issue. We demonstrate that neurons exhibit long-lasting changes in average firing rate that can be sufficient for representing state-dependent information. In addition, we report that these changes in average firing rate can act as a gain control to modulate the magnitude of neural responses to <b>stimuli</b> <b>and</b> behavior. In this way, individual neurons can both represent state-dependent information, and use this information to modulate representations of outcomes associated with <b>stimuli</b> <b>and</b> behavior. ...|$|R
25|$|Referred itch is the {{phenomenon}} {{in which a}} stimulus applied in one region {{of the body is}} felt as an itch or irritation in {{a different part of the}} body. The syndrome is relatively harmless, though it can be irritating, and healthy individuals can express symptoms. Stimuli range from a firm pressure applied to the skin – a scratch – to irritation or pulling on a hair follicle on the skin. The referred sensation itself should not be painful; it is more of an irritating prickle leading to the compulsion to scratch the area. The <b>stimulus</b> <b>and</b> referred itch are ipsilateral (the <b>stimulus</b> <b>and</b> the referred itch occur on the same side of the body). Also, because scratching or putting pressure on the referred itch does not cause the stimulus area to itch, the relationship between the <b>stimulus</b> <b>and</b> the referred itch is unidirectional. The itching sensation is spontaneous and can cease with continued stimulation.|$|E

In the evaluation task after subjects {{were exposed to}} multiple valenced unconditioned <b>stimulus</b> (US) <b>and</b> novel neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) pairs, subjects rated more positively for the CS paired with positive items than for the CS paired with negative items. Subjects were unaware of pairings. Implicit Association Test (IAT) was used to support this result as well. In the IAT, four categories were pleasant and unpleasant items, positive conditioned <b>stimuli</b> <b>and</b> negative conditioned <b>stimuli.</b> Subjects easily associated pleasant items with positive conditioned <b>stimuli</b> <b>and</b> easily associated negative items with negative conditioned <b>stimuli</b> <b>and</b> they found that responding to incompatible pairs was harder. Evidence altogether suggested that attitudes can be conditioned without awareness.|$|R

25|$|A paired word {{associative}} task {{consists of}} two phases. During the first phase (acquisition), {{the responses of the}} paired-associate task are learned and become recallable.

25|$|Race theory {{holds that}} stimuli are {{competing}} for processing power within the brain. Following parietal damage, all contralesional messages are lowered in priority for the brain’s processing in some way – potentially by signal transmission delay – such that when presented with alternative stimuli, the contralesional stimulus doesn’t arrive at the decision center simultaneously with the ipsilesional <b>stimulus,</b> <b>and</b> thus is denied conscious processing.|$|E

The results demonstrated strong and predicted IRAP effects in all four conditions. Although the Random-Fixed presentation generated the strongest D-IRAP score, the randomization of the sample <b>stimuli</b> <b>and</b> response options were both critical to producing strong and significant D-IRAP scores because the Random-Random and Fixed-Random Conditions were only marginally smaller.
