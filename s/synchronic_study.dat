50|$|Pragmatics was a {{reaction}} to structuralist linguistics as outlined by Ferdinand de Saussure. In many cases, it expanded upon his idea that language has an analyzable structure, composed of parts that can be defined in relation to others. Pragmatics first engaged only in <b>synchronic</b> <b>study,</b> as opposed to examining {{the historical development of}} language. However, it rejected the notion that all meaning comes from signs existing purely in the abstract space of langue. Meanwhile, historical pragmatics has also come into being. This field only gained linguists' attention in the 70s. This is when two different schools emerged; notably the Anglo-American pragmatic thought and the European continental pragmatic thought (also called the perspective view).|$|E
5000|$|The {{third and}} final period of Mathesius's work, which lasted until his death, was devoted to functionalist {{theories}} of grammar. He was a leading proponent of this school of thought, although he credits the followers of the Polish linguist Jan Baudouin de Courtenay and the Danish linguist Otto Jespersen with having sowed {{the seeds of the}} movement.

Functionalism remedied these problems, and it also preferred <b>synchronic</b> <b>study</b> over diachronic and favored an analytic approach over a genealogical one.|$|E

40|$|The present paper aims at {{designing}} {{a more accurate}} and richer model applying the grammaticalization approach to the <b>synchronic</b> <b>study</b> of the Biblical Hebrew verbal system. This new proposal - based on the dynamic description of languages and on the panchronic methodology, which are both necessary consequences of the grammaticalization framework, path and chaos theories, {{as well as of}} several principles of cognitive linguistics - constitutes an extension and improvement of the model formulated by John A. Cook. In 2002, J. A. Cook employed grammaticalization laws as the explanatory vehicle of the Biblical Hebrew verbal formations presenting a model which, being based on the findings of the grammaticalization and path theories, went beyond a purely diachronic perspective. However, the contrastive analysis of Cook's proposal with the requirements of the dynamic evolutionary view of languages demonstrates that this first application of the grammaticalization and path theories to the <b>synchronic</b> <b>study</b> of the Biblical Hebrew verb fails to comply with all the prerequisites derived from the two approaches. In light of this, the outline of an exemplary, second generation, model of the improvement will be sketched which in a more truthful manner takes into account the exigencies of the theories related to evolutionary linguistics...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} <b>synchronic</b> <b>studies</b> of {{prosodic}} morphology have analyzed the rich array of reduplication patterns in Sanskrit.

These formations are the subject of a monograph-length study by Krisch (1996). The present study adopts the view represented there, that laryngeal loss in the syllable rhyme and concomitant compensatory lengthening is responsible for the vowel length in the reduplicant, e. g., late PIE *h 1 ge-h 1 gor-e> Skt. jā-g´̄ar-a (RV 5, 44, 14) (cf. Gk. γρήγορα). My proposal differs, however, in that I assume that the “Saussure Effect” 1 operated to delete laryngeals in the context + Ro. 2 A reconstruction that takes the “Saussure Effect ” into account offers an improvement over previous analyses on several counts.

40|$|The article {{reports on}} a cross-linguistic {{synchronic}} and diachronic corpus study on indefinites. The study covered five indefinite expressions, each in a different language. The main goal {{of the study was}} to verify the distribution of these indefinites synchronically and to attest their historical development. The methodology we used is a form of functional labeling which combines both context (syntax) and meaning (semantics) using as a starting point Haspelmath’s (1997) functional map. In the article we identify Haspelmath’s functions with logico-semantic interpretations and propose a binary branching decision tree assigning each instance of an indefinite exactly one function in the map. On Haspelmath’s proposal an indefinite will always express a set of functions that are contiguous on the map. A further prediction is that, if an indefinite acquires new functions, it will develop first those that are adjacent to the original function. The main result of the <b>synchronic</b> <b>studies</b> is that none of the indefinites investigated violates the function contiguity. The main conclusion of the diachronic studies is that the acquisition of new functions is not unidirectional...|$|R

40|$|As is well known, {{relative}} clauses in English are {{the site}} of a clear case of syntactic variation since it is possible to choose among three different options: a WH-word, that or zero when a relative clause is going to be produced. A number of scholars in the recent and not so recent past have been considerably attracted by this variation in the choice of relativizers. I have in mind, in particular, the studies of Ryden (1966), Romaine (1982), Dekeyser (1984) and Rissanen (1984), who explored this aspect from a diachronic perspective or, more recently, the <b>synchronic</b> <b>studies</b> of Guy and Bayley (1995) and Fox and Thompson (1990). In fact, the variational approach has gained a prominent position in sociolinguistic studies since it gives a clearer picture of the syntactic development of a language. The present paper will be concerned with relative pronoun choice in relative clauses in a particular period of the English language, namely, EModE. The crucial difference between previous periods of the English Language and Early Modern English is not the number of relativizers- which has not changed since the 15 th century- but the system that governs its distribution, which is of great interest because in many respects it differs markedly from present English usage. The aim of this paper is, therefore, to provide a numerical account of relativizers i...|$|R

What emerges from the results of both studies is that epistemic predicates encoding different levels of (un-)certainty all seem to progressively develop new polysemies expressing a subjectified form of certainty. In other words, it shown statistically that epistemic predicates expressing different levels of conjecture or guess diachronically all tend to be increasingly employed in contexts of factuality.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{main purpose}} of this paper is to compare and {{contrast}} the treatment of vowel harmony, a kind of long-distance assimilatory phonological process involving vowels, in Turkey's Turkish and Azerbaijani Turkish (Iran). Examining carefully the linguistic data obtained from the dialects and within the framework of generative phonology, the author of the paper has attempted to evaluate the present-day situation of vowel harmony (a <b>synchronic</b> <b>study)</b> in the above- mentioned members of Oghuz languages. The results of the study showed that, except some violations mostly observed in loanwords, there is an innate and high degree of harmony in both of them, along with some degrees of disharmony. It can be claimed that one of the main factors of the observed disharmony, among other factors, is the effect of other languages and the existence of loanwords. Generally speaking, we may conclude that vowel harmony is one of the most active and prominent phonological rules both in Turkey's Turkish and Azerbaijani Turkish (Iran), of course with some degrees of difference...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a <b>synchronic</b> <b>study</b> of the {{derivation}} of ordinal numerals from cardinal numerals {{in several different}} dialects of Dutch, combining a dialectological and a formal linguistic approach. Ordinals are formed with one of two ordinal suffixes, -de or -ste, both of which occur in all Dutch varieties. However, there is variation among several dialects in Flanders (Belgium) : they exhibit stem-suffix combinations which differ from those in Standard Dutch (SD), giving forms like zeven-ste and twaalf-ste for SD zeven-de and twaalf-de. The thesis investigates the patterns of this variation and offers motivations for those patterns. Novel data acquired through an online questionnaire show {{that there are three}} patterns: SD, a core Flemish pattern and a transitional pattern in between. These patterns show a clear geographical distribution. I propose that the distribution of the two suffixes can be largely explained by syllable weight in the transitional system and that an analysis in terms of the final stem consonant or in terms of foot weight cannot capture all the facts...|$|E
40|$|The {{fact that}} in Romanian a direct object is {{sometimes}} morphologically marked by the particle pe and sometimes not is a long attested phenomenon.

The only cases left unexplained are those in which a direct object realized as an unmodified definite or indefinite nominal phrase are optionally marked, whereby the difference in meaning between the two alternative constructions is subtle though significant. Post-verbal indefinite human direct objects are optionally pe-marked. Based on a <b>synchronic</b> <b>study,</b> we will show that besides specificity, discourse prominence also influences the case-marking of indefinite direct objects. Case marked indefinite direct objects show the property of “referential persistence”, i. e. a direct object introduced by an indefinite pe-marked nominal phrase will be more often taken up in the subsequent discourse than its unmarked counterpart. In conclusion, we will add another feature to the local parameters triggering DOM another feature, namely discourse prominence. ...|$|E
