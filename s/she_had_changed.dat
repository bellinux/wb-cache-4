25|$|Blavatsky {{taught that}} humans {{composed}} of three separate parts: a divine spark, an astral fluid body, {{and the physical}} body. Later Blavatsky proclaimed the septenary of Man and Universe. According to Blavatsky, man is composed of seven parts: Atma, Buddhi, Manas, Kama rupa, Linga sharira, Prana, and Sthula sharira.
