40|$|Abstract: The {{rapid and}} green {{formation}} of spherical and dendritic silver nanostructures based on microwave irradiation time was investigated. Silver nanoparticles were successfully fabricated {{by reduction of}} Ag + in a water medium and using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as the stabilizing agent and {{without the use of}} any other reducing agent, and were compared with those synthesized by conventional heating method. UV–vis absorption spectrometry, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) measurements, indicated that increasing the irradiation time enhanced the concentration of silver nanoparticles and slightly increased the particle size. There was a lack of large silver nanoparticles at a high concentration, but interestingly, the formation and growth of silver dendrite nanostructures appeared. Compared to conventional heating methods, the silver nanoparticle suspension produced by irradiated microwaves was more stable over a six-month period in aqueous solution without any <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation...</b>|$|E

The 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay indicated good biocompatibility of the samples. To establish the influence of PLGA/AgNpPGA/ascorbic acid nanoparticles on intracellular ROS formation, we measured the kinetics of their formation in HepG 2 cells by DCFH-DA assay.

40|$|A {{simple and}} green {{chemical}} method {{has been developed}} to synthesize stable bare and capped silver nanoparticles based on the reduction of silver ions by glucose and capping by poly(α,γ,l-glutamic acid) (PGA). The use of ammonia during synthesis was avoided. PGA has had a dual role in the synthesis and {{was used as a}} capping agent to make the silver nanoparticle more biocompatible and to protect the nanoparticles from agglomerating in the liquid medium. The synthesized PGA-capped silver nanoparticles in the size range 5 – 45 nm were stable over long periods of time, without <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation.</b> Morphological examination has shown that the silver nanoparticles had a nearly spherical, multiply twinned structure. The effects of the reaction temperature and the reaction time during the synthesis were investigated too. The biocompatibility of the PGA-capped silver nanoparticles is discussed in terms of in vitro toxicity with human intestinal Caco- 2 cells.

30|$|The {{dominant}} {{source of}} uncertainty {{of this study}} comes from regional climate change scenarios from different climate models, and uncertainties of hydrological model parameters seem playing secondary roles. For example, different GCMs projected different <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> future <b>precipitation</b> changes, implying that current GCMs have very low confidence in projections for precipitation, especially at regional or basin scales. It indicates that a single GCM output may give a totally incorrect <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> future <b>precipitation</b> and confirms the existing the conclusion that multi-GCMs models {{should be used for}} any climate change impact studies. The uncertainty in future projected precipitation changes produces uncertainty in future streamflow for the studied basins. Therefore, one future research priority will be to assess the accuracy of each GCM 20 century run (IPCC 20 C 3 M) against observations during 1961 – 2000.|$|R

These Ag/PGA nanoparticles (AgNpPGAs) were highly stable {{over long periods}} of time without <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation.</b> In addition to obtaining stable AgNpPGAs, a further aim was to examine their encapsulation in the poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) polymer matrix. The current interest of polymer-AgNps in biomedical applications is because a versatile system must have antimicrobial activity upon target contact, without the release of toxic biocides. The synthesis of these PLGA/AgNpPGAs used physicochemical methods with solvent/non-solvent systems. Degradation of these PLGA/AgNpPGAs and the release rate of their AgNPs were studied in physiological solution over three months. The antimicrobial activity of the samples was investigated towards six laboratory control strains from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and one clinical isolate methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain by the broth microdilution method and the results showed superior and extended activity of PLGA/AgNpPGAs. The 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay indicated good biocompatibility of these PLGA/AgNpPGAs. The formation of intracellular reactive oxygen species was measured spectrophotometrically using a fluorescent probe, which showed that these PLGA/AgNpPGAs are not inducers of such species.

Not only especially trained personnel such ar. pharmacists, nurses, or physicians, but also patients oi their families may easily find the precipitate of this mate. rial in a hanging IV solution.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The ethanol lock {{technique}} has shown great potential to eradicate organisms in biofilms and to treat or prevent {{central venous catheter}} related infections. Following instillation of ethanol lock solution, however, the inherent density gradient between blood and ethanol causes gravity induced seepage of ethanol out of the catheter and blood influx into the catheter. Plasma proteins so are exposed to highly concentrated ethanol, which is a classic agent for protein precipitation. We aimed to investigate the precipitating effect of ethanol locks on plasma proteins as a possible cause for reported catheter occlusions. METHODS: Plasma samples were exposed in-vitro to ethanol (concentrations ranging from 7 to 70 v/v%) and heparin lock solutions. In catheter studies designed to mimic different in-vivo situations, the catheter tip {{was placed in a}} plasma reservoir and the material contained within the catheter was analyzed after ethanol lock instillation. The samples underwent standardized investigation for protein precipitation. RESULTS: Protein precipitation was observed in plasma samples containing ethanol solutions above a concentration of 28 %, as well as in material retrieved from vertically positioned femoral catheters and jugular (subclavian) catheters simulating recumbent or head down tilt body positions. Precipitates could not be re-dissolved by dilution with plasma, urokinase or alteplase. Plasma samples containing heparin lock solutions showed no <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Our in-vitro results demonstrate that ethanol locks may be associated with plasma protein precipitation in central venous catheters. This phenomenon could be related to occlusion of vascular access devices locked with ethanol, as has been reported. Concerns should be raised regarding possible complications upon injection or spontaneous gravity induced leakage of such irreversibly precipitated protein particles into the systemic circulation. We suggest limiting the maximum advisable concentration of ethanol to 28 v/v% in catheter lock solutions...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors perform an {{extensive}} sensitivity {{analysis of the}} Indian summer monsoon rainfall to changes in parameters and boundary conditions which are influenced by human activities. For this study, the authors use a box model of the Indian monsoon which reproduces key features of the observed monsoon dynamics such as the annual course <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> and the transitions between winter and summer regimes. Because of its transparency and computational efficiency, this model is highly suitable for exploring the effects of anthropogenic perturbations such as {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} and sulfur dioxide, and land cover changes, on the Indian monsoon. Results of a systematic sensitivity analysis indicate that changes in those parameters which are related to emissions of greenhouse gases lead to an increase in Indian summer rainfall. In contrast, all parameters related to higher atmospheric aerosol concentrations lead to a decrease in Indian rainfall. Similarly, changes in parameters which can be related to forest conversion or desertification, act to decrease the summer precipitation. The results indicate that the <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> changes over India will be dependent on the direction and relative magnitude of different human perturbations.

The streamflow response showed almost the same pattern as that <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> across emission scenarios and climate models, confirming that the precipitation is the primary factor affecting runoff generation.

40|$|Ten Coupled General Circulation Models (CGCMs) {{participated in}} the third phase of Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP 3) are {{assessed}} for the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) in both the pre-Industrial (PI, 0 ka) and mid-Holocene (MH, 6 ka) simulations. Results show that the PMIP 3 model median captures well the large-scale characteristics of the EASM, including the two distinct features of the Meiyu rainbelt and the stepwise meridional displacement of the monsoonal rainbelt. At mid-Holocene, the PMIP 3 model median shows significant warming (cooling) during boreal summer (winter) over Eurasia continent that are dominated by the changes of insolation. However, the PMIP 3 models fail to simulate a warmer annual mean and winter surface air temperature (TAS) over eastern China as derived from proxy records. The EASM at MH are featured by the changes of large-scale circulation over Eastern China while the changes <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> are not significant over its sub-domains of the Southern China and the lower reaches of Yangzi River. The inter-model differences for the monsoon precipitation {{can be associated with}} different configurations of the changes in large-scale circulation and the water vapour content, of which the former determines the <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> changes. The large model spread for the TAS over Tibetan Plateau has a positive relationship with the precipitation in the lower reaches of Yangzi River, yet this relationship does not apply to those PMIP 3 models in which the monsoonal precipitation is more sensitive to the changes of large-scale circulation. Except that the PMIP 3 model median captured the warming of annual mean TAS over Tibetan Plateau, no significant improvements can be concluded when compared with the PMIP 2 models results...|$|R

Approach: AgNO 3 and NaBH 4 were used as a silver precursor and reducing agent, respectively. The properties of Ag/MMT nanocomposites were studied {{as a function of the}} AgNO 3 concentration. The crystalline structure, d-spacing of interlayer of MMT, the size distributions and surface plasmon resonance of synthesized Ag-NPs were characterized using Powder X-Ray Diffraction (PXRD), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and UV-vis spectroscopy. Results: The results obtained from UV-vis spectroscopy of synthesized Ag-NPs showed that the intensity of the maximum wavelength of the plasmon peaks were increased with the increasing in the AgNO 3 concentration. The obtained information from UV-vis spectra of Ag-NPs was in an excellent agreement with the obtained microstructures studies performed by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and their size distributions. The prepared Ag/MMT nanocomposites are very stable over a long period of time in aqueous solution. Conclusion: The synthesized Ag/MMT nanocomposites are very stable in aqueous solution over a long period of time without any <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation.</b> Silver nanoparticles in MMT suspension could be suitable to use antibacterial applications, since MMT is viewed as ecologically and environmentally inert material and used for biological application such as cosmetics and pharmaceutical usage...|$|R
30|$|The {{critical}} {{concern is}} that the observed precipitation trends over the last 40 years in the study watershed showed a rise in total annual precipitation whereas the future climate change predictions of some models project a decrease in precipitation. This casts doubts on the validity of the GCM results. It implies that a single GCM output may give a totally incorrect <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> future <b>precipitation.</b> For example, the magnitude <b>of</b> observed <b>precipitation</b> trend was about 1.16 mm/ 10 years in the Wujiang River watershed, but the projected precipitation trend from BCCR-BCM 20, CNRM-CM 3, CSIRO-MK 30, GFDL-CM 21, and INM-CM 30 would project a decrease <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> for 2030 s under A 1 B scenarios.

In the next steps, the authors will further examine the accuracy of each GCM 20 th century run (IPCC 20 C 3 M) against the observations during 1961 – 2000 for the study watershed to better quantify the link between projected climate change and water availability in the Wujiang River catchment.|$|R
40|$|In this study, a metal chelate polymer (MCP) {{chemical}} {{approach has}} been adopted to fabricate metal-containing polymer used in metal-polymer nanocomposite. The silver-containing polymer was prepared by adding silver nitrate (AgNO 3) to a solution of polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) dissolved in formic acid (HCOOH) to form the PVAc-AgNO 3 MCP solution, and the resultant was cast to form the MCP film. The mechanism for generating silver nanoparticles in the MCP system without addition of the reducing agent, {{and the effect of}} variant AgNO 3 concentration on the variety in the structure of PVAc matrix have been investigated. The characteristics of this MCP film were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As evidenced by the XRD results, formic acid played the role of reducing agent in the generation of silver nanoparticle in the MCP film. The O 1 s spectrum of the XPS revealed that the PVAc polymer in the MCP film was hydrolyzed to obtain the PVAc/PVOH structure. To confirm the amphiphilic property of the MCP, the 0. 5 wt % AgNO 3 MCP system were dispersed in the formic acid aqueous medium to form the Ag-containing micelles, and the relation morphologies between micelle and silver nanoparticle were also investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

The {{purpose of this study}} was to establish and evaluate a test program of methods suitable for detection of physical incompatibility in Y-site administration of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and drugs. Methods: Eight frequently used methods (dynamic light scattering, laser diffraction, light obscuration, turbidimetry, zeta potential, light microscopy, pH-measurements and visual examination using Tyndall beams), were scrutinized to elucidate strengths and weaknesses for compatibility testing. The responses of the methods were tested with samples containing <b>precipitation</b> <b>of</b> calcium phosphate and with heat destabilized TPN emulsions. A selection of drugs (acyclovir, ampicillin, ondansetron and paracetamol) was mixed with 3 -in- 1 TPN admixtures (Olimel® N 5 E, Kabiven® and SmofKabiven®) to assess compatibility (i. e. potential precipitates and emulsion stability). The obtained compatibility data was interpreted according to theory and compared to existing compatibility literature to further check the validity of the methods. Results: Light obscuration together with turbidimetry, visual inspection and pH-measurements were able to capture <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitations.</b> For the analysis of emulsion stability, light obscuration and estimation of percent droplets above 5 μm (PFAT 5) seemed to be the most sensitive method; however laser diffraction and monitoring changes in pH might be a useful support. Samples should always be compared to unmixed controls to reveal changes induced by the mixing. General acceptance criteria are difficult to define, although some limits are suggested based on current experience. The experimental compatibility data was supported by scattered reports in literature, further confirming the suitability of the test program. However, conflicting data are common, which complicates the comparison to existing literature.

40|$|Silver {{nanoparticles}} (Ag-NPs) were synthesized {{into the}} interlamellar space of montmorillonite (MMT) {{by using the}} γ-irradiation technique {{in the absence of}} any reducing agent or heat treatment. Silver nitrate and γ-irradiation were used as the silver precursor and physical reducing agent in MMT as a solid support. The MMT was suspended in the aqueous AgNO 3 solution, and after the absorption of silver ions, Ag+ was reduced using the γ-irradiation technique. The properties of Ag/MMT nanocomposites and the diameters of Ag-NPs were studied as a function of γ-irradiation doses. The interlamellar space limited particle growth (d-spacing [ds] = 1. 24 – 1. 42 nm); powder X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements showed the production of face-centered cubic Ag-NPs with a mean diameter of about 21. 57 – 30. 63 nm. Scanning electron microscopy images indicated that there were structure changes between the initial MMT and Ag/MMT nanocomposites under the increased doses of γ-irradiation. Furthermore, energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectra for the MMT and Ag/ MMT nanocomposites confirmed the presence of elemental compounds in MMT and Ag-NPs. The results from ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and TEM demonstrated that increasing the γ-irradiation dose enhanced the concentration of Ag-NPs. In addition, the particle size of the Ag-NPs gradually increased from 1 to 20 kGy. When the γ-irradiation dose increased from 20 to 40 kGy, the particle diameters decreased suddenly as a result of the induced fragmentation of Ag-NPs. Thus, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy suggested that the interactions between Ag-NPs with the surface of MMT were weak due to the presence of van der Waals interactions. The synthesized Ag/MMT suspension was found to be stable over a long period of time (ie, more than 3 months) without any <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation...</b>|$|R

Thus these new imaging techniques might assist in the diagnosis of gout, in particular in confirming early structural damage. However, little is known about whether gout-specific signs are only identified in clinically involved joints, or also in as yet (clinically) unaffected joints. In addition, we do not know whether the “silent” MSU deposition might be responsible for those unspecific symptoms in patients with HU and unspecific musculo-skeletal problems.

An updated south–north Iceland temperature index is discussed in relation to 20 th century reductions in sea-ice coverage. Net warming over Iceland occurred over all long-term records from the mid 19 th century to the present, consistent with observed global warming trends, but superimposed on this was a marked cooling between the 1940 s and early 1980 s; Icelandic warming resumed around 1985.

40|$|The {{first part}} of this {{dissertation}} has been focused on the preparation of stable dispersion of low band gap conducting polymer consisting of thieno[3, 4 - b]thiophene (T 34 bT) in water. We studied the oxidative chemical dispersion polymerization of T 34 bT in water using three different chemical oxidant systems {{in the presence of the}} polyelectrolyte poly(styrenesulfonic acid). The resulting polymer (PT 34 bT-PSS) is rendered a colloidal dispersion in water with a particle size diameter ranging between 180 and 220 nm depending on the oxidant used for polymerization. PT 34 bT-PSS films have band gaps of ca. 1 eV (1260 nm) with absorption maxima ranging from 1. 4 eV (912 nm) to 1. 7 eV (724 nm). PT 34 bT-PSS films showed ca. 100 % cation dominant ion transport behavior and the doping level of the polymer was calculated to be 26 %. Electrical conductivities for these polymers were found to be dependent on chemical oxidants used and varied from 10 - 2 to 10 - 4 S/cm. ^ In the second part of the thesis, we report an example wherein ring sulfonation of insoluble poly(thieno[3, 4 -b]thiophene) (PT 34 bT) was carried out to produce a low bandgap, water processable sulfonated poly(thienothiophene) (SPoT). We demonstrated the ability to control the sulfonation level and thereby alter spectral properties. Furthermore, we report processing of this polymer via the layer-by-layer (LBL) technique to give ultra thin films that are stable in their neutral form. The band gaps of SPoT is ca. 1. 1 eV. SPoT goes into water and other solvents such as DMSO and DMF.

The properties of these three dimers are compared with respect to oxidation potential, and the resulting PT 34 bTs prepared from them are compared with respect to their optical, electro-optical, and electrical properties. ...|$|R

These sites are: (a) In the walls of the seminiferous tubules, localized in two concentric layers corresponding to the inner and outer layers of the tubular wall; (b) Around the blood vessels and adjacent connective tissue; (c) At the area of contact between the Sertoli cell and spermatids, where a double line of precipitate surrounds the head of the mature spermatids; and (d) In the cell nuclei, disposed between regions of the condensed chromatin. The nucleus of mature spermatids did not show any <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> antimonate <b>precipitation.</b> The implications <b>of</b> this inorganic cation distribution are discussed with relation to their anionic counterparts, their localization in other animal and plant tissues, and the possibility that those sites may represent barriers to the free passage of ions...|$|R
40|$|Contemporary {{precipitation}} {{patterns in}} the Caribbean region are spatially variable, and {{the small number of}} Holocene paleoclimatic records may not adequately capture patterns of variation in the past. The hydrological history of Grenada was inferred from paleolimnological analyses of sediment cores from two crater lakes on the island. The basins were formed by volcanic activity some time during the Last Termination, but were dry between ca. 13 000 and ca. 7200 cal. a BP. After filling, the lakes were initially very shallow, and sedimentation was interrupted by a hiatus ca. 6300 - 5500 cal. a BP, followed by deposition of a thick tephra in both sites. After 5500 cal. a BP, lake level shows considerable multi-centennial variability, superimposed upon a long-term trend of generally higher lake level after 3200 cal. a BP. The pattern of lake-level variation in Grenada shows some similarity with other Caribbean paleoclimatic records in terms of the timing of transitions, but differs from several classic studies in the <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> inferred <b>precipitation</b> change. The differences among records may reflect spatially variable precipitation {{patterns in the}} past in response to the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and to sea surface temperature influences on the trade winds and Caribbean low-level jet.

40|$|Strong ion upflows with field-aligned {{velocity}} above 1000 ms {{were observed}} by the European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) UHF Radar at Tromsø, Norway in the dayside auroral region at heights between 500 – 600 km during the 15 May 1997 magnetic storm. Both the EISCAT observations and the Assimilative Mapping of Ionospheric Electrodynamics (AMIE) simulation {{results show that}} this event occurred in a region with low Joule heating rate, but with strong velocity shear. During the same period, the electron density and temperature showed no <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> soft particle <b>precipitation,</b> {{which is consistent with}} the UVI images from the POLAR satellite, thus excluding possible ion energization through soft particle precipitation. Our simple calculation shows that the velocity shear can provide sufficient energy for the observed ion upflow, thus suggesting shear-driven instabilities as a possible heating mechanism. Key words.

40|$|Future California {{precipitation}} projections possess significant uncertainty, with model projections yielding both wetter and drier trends. This {{uncertainty is}} due to both model differences and internal climate variability. The Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble Project (CESM LENS), with 40 realizations, is used to quantify future changes in California precipitation, {{and the importance of}} internal climate variability. Seasonal and annual mean 21 st century California precipitation trends are examined, including the realization agreement on the <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> the <b>precipitation</b> trend. The important dynamical responses, including changes in storm track activity, are also investigated. CESM LENS yields significant increases in 21 st century annual mean California precipitation. Moreover, 100 % of the realizations yield a positive precipitation trend. This high agreement between realizations illustrates internal climate variability is {{a small portion of the}} uncertainty in California precipitation projections. The December-January-February (DJF) season yields the largest increase in California precipitation. Consistent with the importance of east Pacific extratropical cyclones to DJF California precipitation, CESM LENS projects a significant increase in east Pacific extratropical cyclone activity near the California coast. Furthermore, CESM LENS shows a southeastward shift of the upper level winds in the east Pacific, which act to steer more storms toward the California coast. These results suggest California will likely become wetter with continued greenhouse gas emissions...|$|R
40|$|Here, {{we report}} that {{synthetic}} gallosilicate molecular sieves with the NAT topology and Si/Ga ratios close to but slightly higher than 1. 50 undergo an in situ transformation under their crystallization conditions. The materials have been studied ex situ by using powder X-ray diffraction, elemental and thermal analyses, and multinuclear MAS NMR. The transformation {{is characterized by a}} change in the distribution of Si and Ga of the NAT framework, from a quite (but not completely) disordered phase to a very highly (but not completely) ordered one, accompanied by a change from tetragonal to orthorhombic symmetry. During most of the solution-mediated transformation, no noticeable <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> fresh <b>precipitation,</b> phase segregation, or changes in the chemical composition are detected. Intermediate materials show variations in the degree of Si-Ga ordering and orthorhombic distortion and are not physical mixtures of the disordered and ordered phases. Ab initio calculations strongly suggest a preferential siting of Si in the tetrahedral sites involved in a smaller number of 4 -rings in the NAT topology (i. e., the low multiplicity site). The cost of violations of Loewenstein's rule has also been calculated. For this topology and chemical composition the preferential siting and Loewenstein's rule drive together the system to the ordered configuration. A Monte Carlo sampling procedure affords a reasonable model for the initial, mainly disordered state, which fits well within the experimental disorder-order series...|$|R
40|$|In part III of {{a three-part}} study on North American climate in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP 5) models, the authors examine {{projections}} of twenty-first-century climate in the representative concentration pathway 8. 5 (RCP 8. 5) emission experiments. This paper summarizes and synthesizes results from several coordinated {{studies by the}} authors. Aspects of North American climate change that are examined include changes in continental-scale temperature and the hydrologic cycle, extremes events, and storm tracks, as well as regional manifestations of these climate variables. The authors also examine changes in the eastern North Pacific and North Atlantic tropical cyclone activity and North American intraseasonal to decadal variability, including changes in teleconnections to {{other regions of the}} globe. Projected changes are generally consistent with those previously published for CMIP 3, although CMIP 5 model projections differ importantly from those of CMIP 3 in some aspects, including CMIP 5 model agreement on increased central California precipitation. The paper also highlights uncertainties and limitations based on current results as priorities for further research. Although many projected changes in North American climate are consistent across CMIP 5 models, substantial intermodel disagreement exists in other aspects. Areas of disagreement include projections of changes in snow water equivalent on a regional basis, summer Arctic sea ice extent, the magnitude and <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> regional <b>precipitation</b> changes, extreme heat events across the northern United States, and Atlantic and east Pacific tropical cyclone activity...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a computationally efficient framework for uncertainty studies in global and regional climate change. In this framework, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Integrated Global System Model (IGSM), an integrated assessment model that couples an Earth system model of intermediate complexity {{to a human}} activity model, {{is linked to the}} National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Atmosphere Model (CAM). Since the MIT IGSM-CAM framework (version 1. 0) incorporates a human activity model, it is possible to analyze uncertainties in emissions resulting from both uncertainties in the underlying socio-economic characteristics of the economic model and in the choice of climate-related policies. Another major feature is the flexibility to vary key climate parameters controlling the climate system response to changes in greenhouse gases and aerosols concentrations, e. g., climate sensitivity, ocean heat uptake rate, and strength of the aerosol forcing. The IGSM-CAM is not only able to realistically simulate the present-day mean climate and the observed trends at the global and continental scale, but it also simulates ENSO variability with realistic time scales, seasonality and patterns of SST anomalies, albeit with stronger magnitudes than observed. The IGSM-CAM shares the same general strengths and limitations as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (CMIP 3) models in simulating present-day annual mean surface temperature and precipitation. Over land, the IGSM-CAM shows similar biases to the NCAR Community Climate System Model (CCSM) version 3, which shares the same atmospheric model. This study also presents 21 st century simulations based on two emissions scenarios (unconstrained scenario and stabilization scenario at 660 ppm CO 2 -equivalent) similar to, respectively, the Representative Concentration Pathways RCP 8. 5 and RCP 4. 5 scenarios, and three sets of climate parameters. Results of the simulations with the chosen climate parameters provide a good approximation for the median, and the 5 th and 95 th percentiles of the probability distribution of 21 st century changes in global mean surface air temperature from previous work with the IGSM. Because the IGSM-CAM framework only considers one particular climate model, it cannot be used to assess the structural modeling uncertainty arising from differences in the parameterization suites of climate models. However, comparison of the IGSM-CAM projections with simulations of 31 CMIP 5 models under the RCP 4. 5 and RCP 8. 5 scenarios show that the range of warming at the continental scale shows very good agreement between the two ensemble simulations, except over Antarctica, where the IGSM-CAM overestimates the warming. This demonstrates that by sampling the climate system response, the IGSM-CAM, even though it relies on one single climate model, can essentially reproduce the range of future continental warming simulated by more than 30 different models. Precipitation changes projected in the IGSM-CAM simulations and the CMIP 5 multi-model ensemble both display a large uncertainty at the continental scale. The two ensemble simulations show good agreement over Asia and Europe. However, the ranges <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> changes do not overlap – but display similar size – over Africa and South America, two continents where models generally show little agreement in the <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> changes and where CCSM 3 tends to be an outlier. Overall, the IGSM-CAM provides an efficient and consistent framework to explore the large uncertainty in future projections of global and regional climate change associated with uncertainty in the climate response and projected emissions...|$|R
