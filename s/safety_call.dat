60|$|If {{anything}} {{ought to}} be despotic in a country, it is its government; {{because there is no}} cause of constant operation to make its yoke unequal. But the dominion of a party must continually, steadily, and by its very essence, lean upon the prostrate description. A constitution formed so as to enable a party to overrule its very government, and to overpower the people too, answers the purposes neither of government nor of freedom. It compels that power which ought, and often would be disposed, equally to protect the subjects, to fail in its trust, to counteract its purposes, and to become no better than the instrument of the wrongs of a faction. Some degree of influence must exist in all governments. But a government which has no interest to please the body of the people, and can neither support them nor with <b>safety</b> <b>call</b> for their support, nor is of power to sway the domineering faction, can only exist by corruption; and taught by that monopolizing party which usurps the title and qualities of the public to consider the body of the people as out of the constitution, they will consider those who are in it in the light in which they choose to consider themselves. The whole relation of government and of freedom will be a battle or a traffic.|$|E

When Aaron Rodgers had the ball knocked out of his hand by Mario Williams, it rolled backwards into the end zone and came to a complete stop; Packer RB Eddie Lacy picked up the ball and tried to run with it, but the referee approached quickly, waving his hands to declare the play dead, and after talking to the back judge, signaled a safety for Buffalo. The NFL Director of Officiating said that since the Holy Roller rules were in place, the only person who could have picked up the fumble and advanced it for Green Bay was the original fumbler (Rodgers) and the <b>safety</b> <b>call</b> was correct.|$|E

This should be conducted on Ch. 16 or 2182 instead of using a working channel or frequency. Second, the targeted group must be selected, if necessary.

40|$|The Institute of Medicine (IOM) reports Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21 st Century (2001) and To Err Is Human(2000) were tipping {{points in}} patient safety. The public {{reaction}} to these reports was significant. People paid attention. The report energized patient safety research and applications, prompting much needed research and evidence-based practice. It {{is difficult to}} find a patient safety article that does not reference {{at least one of these}} landmark reports. These early IOM reports were a catalyst for the development of the Doctor of Nurs- ing Practice degree at Purdue University. Subsequent healthcare summits at PurdueUniversity and elsewhere have resulted in common themes, including consumer-drivenhealthcare, basic universal healthcare for all, interoperability of electronic healthrecords, interprofessional education to promote collaboration, and new models of carefor nurse-managed clinic systems. The academic patient <b>safety</b> <b>call</b> to arms occurred in 2003,then the Institute of Medicine publishedHealth Professions Education: A Bridge to Quality. The education report has not enjoyed the media exposure of the earlier two reports, par- tially because talking about education is not as sensational as lost lives. But we who know that the root cause to any issue is complex and convoluted must not lose momentum in solv- ing fundamental education-related patient safety issues. Edu- cation, as a root cause of patient safety issues, is losing livesonce removed. During a root cause analysis, it is always tempting to “re-educate”staff on whatever the identified gap was in the system (Ebright and Rapala, 2003). Without underlying competencies,it is difficult to understand, let alone redesign, patient care pro-cesses. Although many healthcare providers have providedpatient safety education to staff members, and courses are available within some universities, the core competencies mustbe woven into curriculum...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} DaCoTA Work Package 1 is to {{investigate}} road safety policy-making and management processes in Europe. In the Deliverables released previously, the Work Package 1 assessed the experts' needs in terms of road safety knowledge, data and decision support tools (Deliverable 1. 1 / 4. 1), {{as well as the}} road safety stakeholders' views (Deliverable 1. 3). These two Deliverables contain information on the present and future needs and the actual availability of various types of road safety data and knowledge, which the experts and the stakeholders might find useful for their work. As for the Deliverable 1. 2 at hand; it presents the theoretical background for the Work Package 1 'investigation model', as well as the model itself and the questionnaire derived from it. The 'investigation model' was designed {{for the study of the}} different aspects of actual road safety policy-making and management processes in Europe. Its objective is to allow describing concrete road safety policy-making and management practices. Therefore, it is not a 'good practice' model in the normative sense. Rather, it aims at discovering good practices that exist, whether they conform to a normative 'good practice' model designed by experts or not. In designing the investigation model, the group relied on an extensive review of recent literature. Some of the references the group reviewed contain only a small number of case studies. A number of these are limited to well performing developed countries and nevertheless prescribe the implementation of similar structures for road safety decision-making and management in quite different situations and contexts. A few other references, however, advocate a more analytical approach, backing their claim with case studies from a more varied set of countries. In any case, the group decided to draw on elements from all available models, thus ensuring that while the investigation model is now used to study road safety policymaking and management processes in European countries, its use is by no means restricted to Europe or to the developed countries. The investigation model inquires of course about the actors, processes and components of road safety management that can all probably, but not necessarily, be found in well-performing countries, and that quite certainly cannot all be found elsewhere. The results to the questionnaire will allow a first assessment of the idea that a good road safety record is necessarily linked to certain components of road safety management system. Road safety management, understood as an area of public action destined to reduce road un-safety, includes policy-making tasks and transversal processes, as well as the organisation necessary for these tasks and processes to take place. Policymaking tasks form a cycle, going from agenda setting to policy formulation, then to policy adaption, implementation and finally evaluation, before the cycle begins again-and there are of course feedback loops going from evaluation to policy formulation and implementation stages. In order to accomplish these policy-making tasks, some management processes are necessary. The group has identified four such processes. As road safety policymaking is an inter-sectoral activity (i. e. it involves several sectors of governmental action) there is a need for inter-sectoral coordination. Likewise, the diversity of actors involved in road <b>safety</b> <b>call</b> for the involvement of stakeholders. Knowledge must be produced and used to justify the need for a road safety policy and the priority status given to it, as well as to identify available options and arbitrate between them. Finally, there must be a process for capacity building. A road safety management system can function if the institutional and organisational arrangements are adequate; if Road safety management investigation model and questionnaire DaCoTA_WP 1 _D 1. 2 _final_ 2011 - 09 - 21 5 responsibilities are allocated along with sufficient resources; if knowledge transfers between different positions and between generations are effective. Furthermore, there are two immaterial ingredients in an operative road safety management system, that may precede it to some extent, but which are also outputs of the system: the political will and the road safety culture. The model was then used for formulating a series of 69 questions, which assess the different aspects of a road safety management system. After eliminating redundancies, the finalised questionnaire contains 50 closed questions as well as some room for comments from the interviewees. The questionnaires will be used for collecting data from policy-makers and road safety experts in at least 13 European countries in the summer and autumn 2011.; RAPPORT DE CONTRA...|$|E
