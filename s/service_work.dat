However, after breaking his foot in the summer of 1961 during a baseball game and thinking about his college decision outside of basketball, Bradley decided to enroll at Princeton due to its record in preparing students for government or United States Foreign <b>Service</b> <b>work.</b> He had been awarded a scholarship at Duke, but not at Princeton; the Ivy League does not allow its members to award athletic scholarships, and Bradley's family's wealth disqualified him from receiving financial aid.|$|E
5|$|The National Order of the Arrow Conference (NOAC) is a multi-day event {{which usually}} {{takes place on}} a {{university}} campus, bringing together thousands of delegates from OA lodges around the nation for training and activities. NOACs are held every two years, with exceptions made to align the event with significant anniversaries. As a youth-led organization, these national conferences are organized and directed by the elected section and region youth officers, who serve on committees responsible for various conference aspects {{under the leadership of}} the conference vice-chief. Events include training for programs, leadership and American Indian culture; competitions in athletics, ceremonies, cooking and American Indian dances; and exhibits on OA history, outdoor activities, and camping. There are also opportunities to talk with national leaders, perform <b>service</b> <b>work</b> and trade patches. Evening shows have different themes, including American Indian culture and recognition of dance competition winners, presentations of awards including the OA Distinguished Service Award and other entertainment.|$|E

25|$|Research has {{identified}} {{a number of}} OA practices significantly correlating with maintaining abstinence in OA: adherence to a food plan (including weighing and measuring food), communication with other members (specifically sponsors), spending time in prayer and meditation, performing <b>service</b> <b>work,</b> completing the fourth step, completing the ninth step, writing down thoughts and feelings, attending meetings, reading OA/AA literature, and the educational status of the participant. Researchers have therefore concluded that application of OA practices might directly help promote abstinence and reduce the frequency of relapse in those with binge eating disorder and bulimia nervosa.|$|E
25|$|At the outset, all the Shenandoah Valley was {{considered}} part of Orange County, Virginia and the established parish was St. Mark's. However, no record exists that Anglican clergy visited the Valley in that era, nor that that parish vestry handled social <b>service</b> <b>work</b> expected of the established Church. In fact, Governor William Gooch, upon receiving {{a letter from the}} Presbyterian Synod in Philadelphia about how they worshipped according to the established forms of the Church of Scotland, assured them they would be allowed to worship publicly in their own way in Virginia so long as they followed the terms of the English Toleration Act of 1689 and registered their ministers and places of worship with the local county court.|$|E
25|$|On March 27, 1973, Mickey Redmond {{scored two}} goals on Maple Leafs goalie Ron Low in {{a span of}} 18 seconds to become the Red Wings' first ever 50-goal scorer in an 8–1 victory. On November 5, 1975, {{in one of the}} scariest {{incidents}} to ever take place at Maple Leaf Gardens, Red Wings forward, Dan Maloney, repeatedly beat Maple Leafs defenceman Brian Glennie's head off the ice until he went limp. Maloney was charged with assault causing bodily harm, part of a crackdown on hockey violence by Ontario attorney general Roy McMurtry. A plea bargain left Maloney performing community <b>service</b> <b>work</b> while being banned from playing in Toronto for two years. Ironically, Maloney subsequently played for the Maple Leafs from 1977–82, then served as their head coach from 1984–86.|$|E

25|$|Some strong positives {{that have}} been {{identified}} in studies of military brat populations are a high occurrence of very resilient personalities, exceptional social skills, a high level of multicultural or international awareness, proficiency in foreign languages, and a statistically very strong affinity for careers that entail service to others. Studies show that ex-military kids end up pursuing service-related careers in very high numbers: military service, teaching, counseling, police, nursing and foreign <b>service</b> <b>work</b> being highly represented in military brat career statistics (in comparison to statistics on non-military brat patterns of employment choices). Mary Edwards Wertsch also identified a pattern (for those military brats who do not choose military service) of work that is more independent (self-employment / avoidance of direct subservience to authority figures) and along those lines also favoring creative and artistic professions that offer more independence. She also reported that for those military brats who did choose military service there was a tendency to go through a phase of bucking or testing authority during military service, or a pattern of resenting authority, represented in her study population. However, military brats who become soldiers also tend to do well overall in the profession.|$|E

500|$|The B-29Superfortress had a {{difficult}} introduction into <b>service.</b> <b>Work</b> began on designing the bomber in early 1940 and the first prototype flew on 21September 1942. The Superfortress was the largest combat aircraft of World War II and boasted a heavy maximum bomb load, long range and powerful defensive armament. [...] The B-29 also incorporated {{a number of new}} features such as a pressurized cabin and remote-controlled turrets. While 1,664 B-29s had been ordered by the USAAF before the aircraft first flew, its development was set back by several months after the second prototype crashed on 18February 1943 and problems with the design were gradually solved. The 58th Bombardment Wing was formed in June 1943 to operate the USAAF's first B-29s but it did not begin receiving these aircraft until October. The slow delivery of B-29s and mechanical problems with the aircraft meant that the wing lagged behind its training schedule, and only became capable of deployment in March 1944 after the so-called [...] "Battle of Kansas" [...] program began to produce combat-ready aircraft.|$|E

500|$|The Missoula Mills {{replaced}} [...] Village as {{the economic}} power of the valley and replaced it as the county seat in 1866. The name [...] "Missoula" [...] came from the Salish name for the Clark Fork River, [...] "nmesuletkw", which roughly translates as [...] "place of frozen water". Fort Missoula was established in 1877 to help protect further arriving settlers. Growth accelerated {{with the arrival of}} the Northern Pacific Railway in 1883, and the Town of Missoula was chartered the same year. In 1893, Missoula was chosen as the location of the state's first university, the University of Montana. The need for lumber for the railway and its bridges spurred the opening of multiple saw mills in the area and, in turn, the beginning of Missoula's lumber industry, which remained the mainstay of the area's economy for the next hundred years. The continued economic windfall from railroad construction and lumber mills led to a further boom in Missoula's population. [...] and Copper Kings Marcus Daly and William A. Clark competed fiercely in the region over lumber share and Missoula investments. The United States Forest <b>Service</b> <b>work</b> in Missoula began in 1905. Missoula is also home of the smokejumpers' headquarters and will be the site of the National Museum of Forest Service History. Nationally, there are nine Forest Service regions; Region1 is headquartered in Missoula.|$|E
