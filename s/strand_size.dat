Well-differentiated liposarcoma represents a radiographic diagnostic dilemma. To determine the accuracy, interrater reliability, and relationship of <b>stranding,</b> nodularity, and <b>size</b> in the MRI differentiation of lipoma and well-differentiated liposarcoma, MRI scans of 60 patients with large (> 5 cm), deep, pathologically proven lipomas or well-differentiated liposarcomas were examined by 10 observers with subspecialty training blinded to diagnosis. Observers indicated whether the amount of <b>stranding,</b> nodularity, and <b>size</b> of each tumor suggested a benign ormalignant diagnosis and rendered a diagnosis of lipoma orwell-differentiated liposarcoma. The accuracy, reliability, and relationship of <b>stranding,</b> nodularity, and <b>size</b> to diagnosis were calculated for all samples. 69 % of reader MRI diagnoses agreed with final pathology diagnosis (95 % CI 65 – 73 %).

40|$|There is an {{emerging}} {{interest in the}} aerospace industry to manufacture composite components with intricate geometries. One {{way to do this}} is by using a bulk moulding compound which consists of strands of unidirectional carbon-fibre tape. This material system is termed randomly-oriented strand (ROS) composites. The great design potential of ROS composites has been demonstrated in the literature, but the modelling techniques for this material are in their infancy. This paper proposes a stochastic 2 D modelling technique for predicting strength of ROS composites from the mechanical properties of the individual strands. This model is representative of the microstructure and the through-the-thickness fracture morphologies characteristic to ROS composites. Classical laminate theory and Hashin's criteria are used to predict strand breakage, while interlaminar strength and fracture toughness are implemented to account for strand debonding. The model successfully predicts the strength of ROS composites, captures the effect of <b>strand</b> <b>size</b> on properties, depicts heterogeneous nature of the material, and demonstrates that failure follows the 2 ̆ 01 cweakest-link 2 ̆ 01 d principle.

40|$|The use of {{cold-drawn}} {{prestressing steel}} as reinforcement in concrete is common among bridge design throughout the world. This composite material is particularly useful for designs consisting of large spans where the dead load will cause significant cracking and deflection. Unlike mild steel reinforcement, prestressing steel is stressed and cause a compression force within the concrete. This prevents cracking {{and increases the}} structure’s capacity. A prestressed concrete member will also have a longer life expectancy due to the prevention of cracks. Without cracks the steel will not {{be exposed to the}} environment and therefore will be at a reduced risk of corrosion. The increased capacity, ability to sustain longer spans, and durability make this type of material an advantageous choice of construction. This paper investigates the residual properties of seven wire, uncoated, 0. 5 in. (12. 7 mm) and 0. 375 in.

For any given preparation {{the upper and}} lower 95 % size limits may differ by a factor of ten or more. Single-stranded molecular weights indicate an average of 1 to 4 breaks per single strand of the native DNA. The reduction in transforming activity and viscosity following DNAase I digestion can be accounted for by a direct relationship between the transforming activity of a DNA and its single-stranded molecular weight. Uptake studies with DNAase I treated heavy (2 H 15 N 3 H) DNA show that single strand breaks inhibit integration less than transformation.

(c) Cells containing donor DNA show a lag in DNA replication following transformation, (d) When donor DNA is replicated it initially appears in a density region between light and hybrid.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients {{with heart}} failure (HF) have an {{increased}} QRS duration, usually attributed to decreased conduction velocity (CV) due to ionic remodeling but which may alternatively result from increased heart size or cellular uncoupling. We investigated the relationship between QRS width, heart size, intercellular coupling, and CV in a rabbit model of moderate HF and in computer simulations. METHODS AND RESULTS: HF was induced by pressure-volume overload. Heart weight (21. 1 +/- 0. 5 versus 10. 2 +/- 0. 4 g, mean+/-SEM; P < 0. 01) and QRS duration (58 +/- 1 versus 50 +/- 1 ms; P < 0. 01) were increased in HF versus control. Longitudinal CV (thetaL; 79 +/- 2 versus 67 +/- 4 cm/s; P < 0. 01) and transversal subepicardial CV (thetaT; 43 +/- 2 versus 37 +/- 2 cm/s; P < 0. 05) were higher in HF than in controls. Transmural CV (thetaTM) was unchanged (25 +/- 2 versus 24 +/- 1 cm/s; P=NS). Patch-clamp experiments demonstrated that sodium current was unchanged in HF versus control. Immunohistochemical experiments revealed that connexin 43 content was reduced in midmyocardium but unchanged in subepicardium. Myocyte dimensions were increased in HF by approximately 30 %. Simulated strands of mammalian ventricular cells (Luo-Rudy dynamic model) revealed increased thetaL and thetaT with increased myocyte size; however, increased CV could not compensate for increased <b>strand</b> <b>size</b> of longitudinally coupled cells, and consequently, total activation time was longer. CONCLUSIONS: Increased myocyte size combined with the observed expression pattern of connexin 43 yields increased thetaL and thetaT and unchanged thetaTM in our nonischemic model of HF.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the arrangement of wood strands at the surface of oriented strand board (OSB) by image analysis. Two-dimensional image analysis enables the number of strands and the area of each strand to be computed. In addition, the fiber direction of each strand may be measured manually by recording the acute angle between the fiber direction and the longitudinal axis of the specimen. The image analysis results suggest the following. the average strand area is proportional to the reciprocal of the number of strands. Samples containing many smaller strands exhibit a larger variation in <b>strand</b> <b>size.</b> The average strand area does not correlate with the distribution of the strand area represented by the coefficient of variation. However, there is a reasonable correlation between the number of smaller strands in the range 0 to 1 cm(2) and the coefficient of variation of strand area. At low average fiber orientations, i. e. better orientation with the principal panel axis, there is smaller variability in orientation. The upper side and lower side of OSB exhibit a different relationship between average fiber orientation and strand area. The upper side of the specimens contains larger strands and exhibits better fiber orientation than the lower side. This is thought to be a function of the production process. The lower side strands fall on a smooth moving substrate, whereas the upper side strands fall on a stable substrate of strands. The number of strands is lower on the upper side of the OSB panel because small size strands tend to migrate to the lower side of the OSB during production. The small particles tend to be vibrated through the strand mat to the lower face before pressing...|$|E
40|$|The {{strength}} of wood-based materials made of {{several layers of}} big and oriented particles like OSB (oriented strand board) is a superposition of {{the strengths of the}} layers according to the orientation of the particles and depending from their size distribution. It would be desirable to measure particle geometry and orientation close to the production process, e. g. with a "view onto the mat". Currently, continuous online measurements of the particle geometry are not possible, while measurements of separated particles would be too costly and time-consuming. Before measuring particle shapes they have to be reconstructed in a multi-stage procedure which considers an image scene with strands as "gray value mountains". Segmentation using a watershed algorithm is not sufficient. Also a two-step edge detector according to Canny does not yield closed object shapes. A multi-step procedure based on threshold de-composition and recombination however is successful: The gray values in the image are transformed into a reduced and uniformly distributed set of threshold levels. The local morphological gradients between these levels are used to re-build the original particle shapes by adding the threshold levels. Only shapes with a plausible size corresponding to real particle shapes are included in order to suppress noise. The result of the reconstruction from thresh-old levels is then matched with the result of the strong edges in the original image, which had been detected using a Canny operator, and is finally cleaned with morphological operators. This extended threshold analysis produces sufficiently segmented images with object shapes corresponding extensively to the particle shapes. Standard algorithms are used to measure geometric features of the objects. An approxima-tion of particle shapes with ellipses of equal moments of inertia is useful. Remaining incorrectly detected objects are removed by form factors and size intervals. Size distributions for the parameters length and width are presented and characterized as density distribution histograms, weighted by the object area and linearly scaled (q 2 distribution), as well as the cumulated distribution and different quantiles. A demonstration software "SizeBulk" based on MATLAB has been developed to demonstrate the computation and the interaction of algorithms. Image sequences can be processed and different variations of image preprocessing and parametrization can be tested. However, the detection procedure yields complete shapes only for those particles in the top layer. Objects in lower layers are partially hidden and cannot be measured completely. Artificial images with separated and with overlaid objects with a known size distribution were generated to study this effect. It was shown that size distributions are influenced by this covering effect and also by the strand orientation, but that at least the modes of the most important size parameters length and width remain in evidence. Artificial images and several samples with OSB strands from industrial and laboratory pro-duction were used for testing. They were measured as single strands as well as arrange-ments similar to an OSB mat. For real strands, the same covering effects to the size distributions revealed as in the simulation. Under stable image acquisition conditions and using similar processing parameters the characteristics of these samples can well be measured, and changes in the size distributions are definitely due to the geometric properties of the strands. The suitability of the processing procedure for the characterization of <b>strand</b> <b>size</b> distributions could also be confirmed for images acquired from OSB mats in a production line. Moreover, it could be shown that the extended threshold analysis is also suitable to evaluate images of particle board surfaces and to draw conclusions about the size distribution of the top layer particles. Therefore, the method presented here is a novel possibility to measure size distributions of OSB strands through the evaluation of partial gray value images of the mat surface. In principle, this method is suitable to be transferred to an industrial application. So far, methods that address the problem of detecting trends of the <b>strand</b> <b>size</b> distribution were not known, and this work shows new perspectives for process monitoring...|$|E

While it could be now considered as a well-established wood-based panel, oriented strand boards do not yet achieve optimal properties. Proof of this are the technological developments being carried out intensively in RTD for every process step, from flaking until pressing. This paper deals in two first parts with possibilities of assessing crucial parameters such as <b>strand</b> <b>size</b> and orientation using innovative off-line and on-line methods. The latter are based on image processing and were developed at the Fraunhofer insitute, Wilhelm-Klauditz-Institute for Wood Research (WKI) for answering both industrial and laboratory needs in matter of optimization of structure. Particular attention was paid to the statistical characterization of a batch of strands: It was shown that main dimensions of a population of strands are mostly lognormally distributed and then may be described using a small set of suitable indices. Numerous batches were analysed and the influence of climatic and processing parameters on post-disintegration was investigated. For industrial applications, an on-line mat quality assessment system ready for use between the forming station and the press was developed. To illustrate possibilities of structure optimization, results of investigations of strengthening of OSB with strands of optimal geometry will be presented. Thanks to additions of small quantities of veneer strips, the so-called "uniform strands", the bending properties of panels were highly increased. Advantages could be taken of that statement by saving on adhesive amounts so as to reach properties required by norms, or by putting on the market a strengthened OSB. The surface evenness that affects the suitability of OSB regarding painting and coating was also assessed using a measuring technique based on fringe-projection and image processing.

40|$|One goal of {{cartilage}} {{tissue engineering}} (CTE) is to create constructs for regeneration of hyaline cartilage. Three-dimensional (3 D) -printed cartilage constructs fabricated from polycaprolactone (PCL) and chondrocyte-impregnated alginate mimic the biphasic nature of articular cartilage and offers great promise for CTE applications. However, ensuring that these constructs provide biologically conducive environment and mechanical support for cellular activities and articular cartilage regeneration is still a challenge. That said, the regulatory pathway for medical device development requires validation of implants such as these through in vitro bench test and in vivo preclinical examination prior to their premarket approval. Furthermore, mechano-transduction and secretion of cartilage-specific ECM are influenced by mechanical stimuli directed at chondrocytes. Thus, ensuring that these cartilage constructs have mechanical properties {{similar to that of}} human articular cartilage is crucial to their success. Non-invasive imaging techniques are required for effective evaluation of progression of these cartilage constructs. However, current non-invasive techniques cannot decipher components of the cartilage constructs, nor their time-dependent structural changes, because they contain hydrophobic and hydrophilic biomaterials with different X-ray refractive indices. The aims of this thesis were to develop 3 D-printed cartilage constructs that biologically and mechanically mimic human articular cartilage and to investigate synchrotron radiation inline phase contrast computed tomography (SR-inline-PCI-CT) as a non-invasive imaging technique to characterize components of these constructs and associated time-dependent structural changes. The first objective was to determine in vitro biological functionality of the cartilage constructs over a 42 -day period with regards to cell viability and secretion of extracellular matrix by traditional invasive assays. In parallel, performance of SR-inline-PCI-CT for non-invasive visualization of components and associated structural changes within the constructs in vitro over a 42 -day was examined. To achieve this objective, three sample-to-detector distances (SDDs) : 0. 25 m, 1 m and 3 m were investigated. Then, the optimal SDD with better phase contrast and edge enhancement fringes for characterization of the multiple refractive indices within the constructs was utilized to visualize their structural changes over a 42 -day culture period. Like the first objective, the second objective was to examine in vivo biological functionality of the cartilage constructs by traditional invasive assays and utilize SR-inline-PCI-CT to non-invasively visualize components of the hybrid cartilage constructs over a 21 -day period post-implantation in mice. The third objective was to modulate mechanical properties of PCL framework of the 3 D-printed PCL-based cartilage constructs to mimic mechanical properties of human articular cartilage. To achieve this, effect of modulation of PCL's molecular weight (MW) and scaffold's pore geometric configurations: <b>strand</b> <b>size</b> (SZ), strand spacing (SS), and strand orientation (SO), on mechanical properties of 3 D-printed PCL scaffolds were studied. Then, regression models showing the effect of SZ, SS, and SO on porosity, tensile moduli and compressive moduli of scaffold were developed. Compressive and tensile properties of these scaffolds were compared with those of human articular cartilage. Then, “modulated PCL scaffolds” with mechanical and biomimetic properties that better mimic human articular cartilage was identified and recommended for fabrication of PCL-based cartilage constructs. This thesis demonstrated effective in vitro and in vivo biological performance of the 3 D-printed hybrid cartilage constructs studied and presented a significant advancement in CTE applications. To be precise, cell viability was at a minimum of 77 % and secretion of sulfated GAGs and Col 2 increased progressively within cartilage constructs over a 42 -day in vitro. Similarly, cell viability was consistently above 70 %, and secretion of sulfated GAGs and Col 2 increased post-implantation of constructs in mice over a 21 -day period. Furthermore, SR-inline-PCI-CT demonstrated phase contrast and edge-enhancement fringes effective for visualization of the different components and subtle variations within the biphasic cartilage constructs, and thus, offers great potential for their non-invasive and three-dimensional visualization. Lastly, this thesis presented a significant advancement towards development of PCL constructs with mechanical behavior that mimic that of human articular cartilage. The statistical regression models developed showed the effect of SZ, SS, and SO on porosity, tensile moduli and compressive moduli of scaffolds and recommended sets of parameters for fabrication of “modulated PCL scaffolds” with mechanical properties that better mimic mechanical behavior of human articular cartilage. These “modulated PCL scaffolds” could serve as a better framework and could guide more effective secretion of cartilage-specific ECM within PCL-based constructs for CTE applications...|$|E

If the bead pattern is random, the only concern is that one <b>strand</b> be <b>sized</b> shorter than the next, so they will all lie flat and not interfere with each other when worn or displayed. However, if a specific repeating pattern is planned, then careful planning will be required so that the placement of matching portions of the pattern between the strands is aligned properly. A beading board, generally a flat panel with measured curved indentations in several staggered lengths, is {{a useful tool for}} spacing the beads to work out the desired pattern. Once the design has been worked out, joining the strands together might require special multiple-strand clasp fixtures unless there is a single knotting point or specific design element that will accommodate it.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: An {{increased}} circular dichroism (CD) {{signal of}} large molecular aggregates formed upon DNA condensa-tion was observed {{a long time}} ago, and {{is often referred to}} as w-CD. The effort to understand this phenomenon is further motivated by the latest DNA packing studies and advances in macromolecular chemistry. In the present work, the transition dipole coupling model describing interactions of molecules with light has been extended to han-dle systems of arbitrary size. The analytical formulae obtained retain the simplicity and computational speed of the standard approach. The origin of the w-effect was investigated on several model systems. The results suggest that the CD enhancement is primarily caused by delocalized phonon-like excitations in nucleic acid <b>strands.</b> The <b>size</b> of the system exhibiting the effect thus does not need to be comparable with or greater than the wavelength of the absorbed light. Small structural irregularities still allow for the enhancement while a larger disorder breaks it. The modeling is consistent with previous experimental electronic and vibrational CD studies, and makes it possible to correlate the enhancement with the geometry of the nucleic acid systems...|$|R
40|$|Conventional DNA {{separation}} procedures involve large sizes, high voltages and are {{unfit for}} large molecules. Proposed set-up constitutes two fold separation techniques, porous filter for fractionating <b>strands</b> on <b>size</b> and final run through microchannels (agarose, buffer solution) viscous enough for DNA electrophoresis. For {{arriving at the}} final set-up all the physical contradictions like voltage, viscosity of the fluid, length of the channel were analyzed. The physical set up consists around 20 microchannels (varying diameters) positioned at 500 um (centre-to-centre spacing) assembling entire device within 1 cm. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) treated DNA assays, are fed to microchannel entrances. Mixture of DNA strands are then passed through magnetic filters. Filtering property of the filters is adjusted by regulating corresponding magnetic field strengths. Smallest strands pass through small pored filter, owing to high velocity (in electrophoresis), thus categorization being done. Proposal replaces conventional apparatus by miniaturized equipment, in ideal case disposable. Miniaturization reduced voltages requirement, solving high-voltage handling problems. Proposed apparatus can fractionate large (> 200 kbp) molecules and even organic molecules...|$|R
50|$|The TMEM251 gene {{is located}} on human {{chromosome}} 14, at 14q32.12, on the plus <b>strand.</b> The gene <b>size</b> is 1,277 base pairs. It contains 3 distinct introns, and transcription produces six different mRNAs that appear to differ by truncation of the 3' end. There are 2 transcript variants that encode for the TMEM251 protein, with the longer one being 169 base pairs in length, and the shorter one being 131 base pairs in length. The first transcript variant encodes a shorter predicted protein, while the second transcript variant encodes a protein with a longer N-terminus. Both consists of two exons that include the entire coding sequence for the TMEM251 protein.|$|R
40|$|By {{a special}} {{plastometric}} method, the straightening {{operation of a}} vertically cast strand of two carbon steels was simulated. The temperature dependence of the low strain rate plasticity of both the steels examined is analogous although caused by very different reasons. As to the plain carbon steel, the amount of ferrite and its location is of prime importance, whereas {{in the case of}} eutectoid steel various modes of fracture and the influence of temperature on the relative plasticity of type II MnS inclusions are influencial. To avoid transverse cracking, it seems to be suitable to keep the strand at a rather high temperature (above 900 degrees C). Temperature cycling seems to be fundamental as to the structural changes taking place in the <b>strand</b> (grain <b>size</b> refining, ferrite fraction if any), whereas analogous influences of straining are more or less inexpressive. Of course, the results obtained are of quality only since the practical and laboratory conditions differ significantly. The knowledge obtained could be applied in regulating the intensity of strand cooling with the aim of lowering the waste portion and improving the surface quality of worked products...|$|R
40|$|CAG {{trinucleotide repeat}} (CTR) {{sequence}} often appears in mammalian genome including transcription-regulatory protein and homeobox genes. Its expansion {{is associated with}} six genetic disorders in human. To identify novel CTR-containing genes expressed in mouse brain, a brain cDNA library was screened using an oligonucleotide, (CTG) 10. Eight clones were novel mouse genes and they were sequenced on both <b>strands.</b> The <b>size</b> of the cloned DNA ranged from 0. 5 to 2. 1 kb. The number of the CAG repeats in the clones ranged from 6 to 25. The inserts of the clones were analyzed for open reading frames and the peptide sequences were used for a GenBank homology search. of the clones, one (CAG- 6) shared 13 consecutive identical amino acid residues with the OB-cadherin gene, a member of cadherin family. CAG- 14 showed high homology (657 nucleotides identity in 1022 nucleotides 64 %) with the 3 '-untranslated region of rat leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR) tyrosine phosphatase receptor. All the 8 clones were originated from mouse DNA as judged by Southern blot analysis of mouse genomic DNA. The expression of the clones in mouse brain was addressed by RT-PCR and 4 clones showed specific expression. ope...|$|R
40|$|AbstractQβ replicase, an RNA-dependent RNA {{polymerase}} of bacteriophage Qβ, uses single-stranded RNA as {{a template}} to synthesize the complementary strand. A single-stranded RNA template may contain rigid secondary structures, such as long stems, intermolecular double-stranded RNA regions. Presently, {{the effect of}} the size of such double-stranded regions on the replication of RNA by Qβ replicase is unknown. In this study, we prepared RNA templates hybridized with complementary RNA or DNA <b>strands</b> of various <b>sizes</b> and analyzed their replication by Qβ replicase. We found that Qβ replicase synthesizes the complementary strand as long as the template RNA is hybridized with no more than 200  nt fragments, although the replication amounts were decreased. This is important information to evaluate processivity of Qβ replicase...|$|R
40|$|Amino acid {{sequence}} analysis has {{established that the}} homologous pairing protein of Ustilago maydis, known previously in the literature as rec 1, is encoded by REC 2, a gene essential for recombinational repair and meiosis with regional homology to Escherichia coli RecA. The 70 -kDa rec 1 protein is most likely a proteolytic degradation product of REC 2, which has a predicted mass of 84 kDa but which runs anomalously during sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis with an apparent mass of 110 kDa. To facilitate purification of the protein product, the REC 2 gene was overexpressed from a vector that fused a hexahistidine leader sequence onto the amino terminus, enabling isolation of the REC 2 protein on an immobilized metal affinity column. The purified protein exhibits ATP-dependent DNA renaturation and DNA-dependent ATPase activities, which were reactions characteristic of the protein as purified from cell extracts of U. maydis. Homologous pairing activity was established in an assay that measures recognition via non-Watson-Crick bonds between identical DNA <b>strands.</b> A <b>size</b> threshold of about 50 bp was found to govern pairing between linear duplex molecules and homologous single-stranded circles. Joint molecule formation with duplex DNA well under the size threshold was efficiently catalyzed when one strand of the duplex was composed of RNA. Linear duplex molecules with hairpin caps also formed joint molecules when as few as three RNA residues were present...|$|R
