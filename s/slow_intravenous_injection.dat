50|$|Tildren is {{administered}} intravenously. It is labeled for 0.1 mg/kg dosing, once daily for 10 days by <b>slow</b> <b>intravenous</b> <b>injection,</b> which for a 500 kg horse {{works out to}} be 1 vial per day. However, one study giving all 10 doses at once (1 mg/kg IV as a single CRI) {{was found to have}} the same pharmacological effects, and is used clinically. It may be given systemically or locally, by regional limb perfusion. Although RLP is thought to have certain benefits, including decreased cost and reduced risk of adverse effects, some diseases must be treated systemically, such as osteoarthritis of the vertebral column. Systemic administration is often given by adding a 1 mg/kg dose into a 1 liter fluid bag, which is slowly given over 60-90 minutes. Its effects are reported to last 4 months or longer, with a peak effect 6-8 weeks post treatment. The effects of regional limb perfusion has come into question due to in vitro studies showing that high doses given by RLP or intraarticular injection may damage articular cartilage by chondrocyte apoptosis. Further studies are needed to evaluate the safety of Tildren administration via RLP.|$|E

40|$|Background. Nephrosis-induced endothelial {{dysfunction}} {{is assumed}} to play a main role in cardiovascular morbid-ity. Adriamycin-induced proteinuria is a well-established rat model for nephrotic syndrome. However, induction of nephrosis by intravenous adriamycin administration might exert direct adriamycin cardiovasculotoxicity that could ob-scure or modify nephrosis-induced vascular dysfunction. The present study, therefore, investigated in vitro vascular function in the isolated thoracic aorta and isolated perfused hearts of rats with adriamycin nephrosis, as compared to non-nephrotic adriamycin exposed rats.

Serial whole-body 18 F-GP 1 PET/CT acquisition covering vertex to toe was conducted in three scanning sessions. The first time window ranged from 0 (immediately after radiotracer injection)– 35  min, the second session from 60 to 80  min and the third session from 120 to 140  min. For attenuation correction of the PET scan, a low dose CT (100  kV, 20  mAs) was performed for each imaging session.

30|$|In {{the present}} BNCT practice, l-paraboronophenylalanine labeled with 10 B and {{conjugated}} with fructose (BPA-fr) is mainly {{used as the}} carrier of 10 B into the tumor cells. In order to evaluate BPA-fr accumulation in the tumors, 4 -borono- 2 - 18 [*]F-fluoro-phenylalanine (FBPA) PET has been employed [4]. Imahori et al. demonstrated that both BPA-fr and FBPA accumulated in high concentration in high-grade gliomas [5]. In clinical practice, the measurement of FBPA accumulation was made about 1  h after FBPA administration [7]-[10]. However, there are several limitations of FBPA PET in predicting BPA-fr accumulation in the tumors and normal tissues. Firstly, the chemical structure of FBPA {{differs from that of}} BPA-fr. Secondly, FBPA PET provides tracer-dose pharmacokinetics of FBPA, while therapeutic doses of 10 BPA are administered (approximately 500  mg/kg) for BNCT. Thirdly, BPA-fr is administered by <b>slow</b> bolus <b>intravenous</b> <b>injection</b> followed by drip infusion during neutron irradiation, while FBPA is administered by a single bolus injection. Because of these differences, the predictive value of FBPA PET for BPA-fr accumulation in the tumor and normal tissues remains unclear.|$|R
40|$|IT {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that malignant tumours depend on a labile coagulative factor for their invasive growth (O'Meara and Jackson, 1958; O'Meara, 1958). This factor, which is elaborated by the malignant cells, diffuses out into the tissue spaces {{in advance of the}} tumour and converts the fibrinogen of the interstitial fluid to fibrin. Fibrinolysis does not take place and the unresolved fibrin undergoes organisation. In this way a vascular stroma is prepared for the tumour which enables it to establish, and maintain, its autonomous growth. Protamine sulphate was found to inhibit the coagulative factor in vitro (Thornes and O'Meara, 1961) and it was considered that protamine might be of value in the treatment of malignant disease. However, protamine sulphate has a high acid residue and is not suitable for injection in high concentrations. Other forms of protamine are available. Prolothan A (Evans) is protamine in combination with sodium formaldehyde bisulphate.

40|$|A {{double-blind}} crossover {{trial was}} carried out during 22 episodes of life-threatening asthma in 19 patients to compare salbutamol given as a 500 microgram intravenous injection and as a 0. 5 % solution administered by intermittent positive-pressure breathing (IPPB) for three minutes. Relief of pulsus paradoxus was significantly better after IPPB than the intravenous treatment. Both treatments significantly improved the peak expiratory flow rate. Salbutamol given intravenously produced a mean increase in heart rate of over 20 beats/min five minutes after treatment compared with the relief of tachycardia that occurred after administration by IPPB. Four patients had noticeable cardiovascular side effects after salbutamol given intravenously, but no such effects were noticed after administration by IPPB.

Various cardiac dysrrhythmias including supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) associated with hypertension and atrial fibrillation occurred. Following IV esmolol and metoprolol, the patient reverted to normal sinus rhythm. Repeat ECGs revealed ST depression resolution without pre-admission changes. Metoclopramide is a non-specific dopamine receptor antagonist. Seven cases of cardiac arrest and one of sinus arrest with metoclopramide were found in the literature. The metoclopramide prescribing information does not list precautions or adverse drug reactions (ADRs) related to cardiac arrest. The reaction is not dose related but may relate to the IV administration route. Coronary artery disease was the sole risk factor identified. According to Naranjo, the association was possible. Other reports of cardiac arrest, severe bradycardia, and SVT were reviewed. In one case, five separate IV doses of 10 mg metoclopramide were immediately followed by asystole repeatedly. The mechanism(s) underlying metoclopramide’s cardiac arrest-inducing effects is unknown. Structural similarities to procainamide may play a role. In view of eight previous cases of cardiac arrest from metoclopramide having been reported, further elucidation of this ADR and patient monitoring is needed. Our report should alert clinicians to monitor patients and remain diligent in surveillance and reporting of bradydysrrhythmias and cardiac arrest in patients receiving metoclopramide...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} shown by Widmark (1) and {{confirmed}} by Harger and Hulpieu (2) that in animals dinitrophenol is capable of in-creasing {{the rate at which}} the alcohol concentration of the blood falls. Newman and Cutting (3) were unable to produce this effect with safe therapeutic doses of dinitrophenol in man. Widmark (1) raised, but did not answer, the question as to whether the accelerated fall was due to stimulation of oxidation of alcohol by the drug or by the hyperthermia, or to increased elimination through the lungs from hyperventilation. New-man, Cutting and Tainter (4) demonstrated stimulation of alco-hol metabolism of rat liver in vitro, by certain concentrations of diitrophenol, but this was slight in degree, and appeared inade-quate to account for the reported changes. Further work seemed desirable to determine the mechanism by which this increased rate of alcohol disappearance was brought about. In the pres-ent study, we have demonstrated that the blowing off of alcohol from the lungs, by hyperventilation, is adequate to explain its increased rate of disappearance from the body after dinitrophe-nol, and therefore, other metabolic mechanisms need not be postulated.
