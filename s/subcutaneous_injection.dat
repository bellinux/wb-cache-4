40|$|Aim: To compare intra-amniotic versus fetal <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>injections</b> for {{selective}} fetal labeling in multifetal rat pregnancies. Methods: A {{total of}} 14 pregnant rats were randomized to receive intra-amniotic injections of dyes (including Fluorescein, Indigo Carmine, or Evans Blue) or fetal <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>injections</b> (of commercial tattoo ink) both guided by ultrasound at 15 - 17 days of gestation. Survival, injection, and labeling success rates of both techniques were compared. Results: Survival rates (84. 4 % for intra-amniotic injections vs. 90. 9 % for fetal <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>injections)</b> and injection success rates (94 % for intra-amniotic injections vs. 100 % for fetal <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>injections)</b> were similar among both groups. None of the neonates from the intra-amniotic injections group were labeled at birth, while 93 % of the neonates from fetal <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>injections</b> group were tagged, showing a visible {{spot in the}} skin at birth. Conclusion: Our results suggest that ultrasound-guided fetal <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>injections</b> might be an adequate strategy for selectively labeling fetuses in multifetal pregnant animals...|$|R

25|$|NPH (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn) insulin is an intermediate-acting insulin with delayed {{absorption}} after <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>injection,</b> {{used for}} basal insulin support in diabetes type 1 and type 2. NPH insulins are suspensions that require shaking for reconstitution prior to injection. Many people reported problems when being switched to intermediate acting insulins in the 80s, using NPH formulations of porcine/bovine insulins. Basal insulin analogs were subsequently developed and introduced into clinical practice to achieve more predictable absorption profiles and clinical efficacy.|$|E
25|$|Pegylated {{interferon}} (PEG IFN) is dosed {{just once}} a week as a <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>injection</b> and is both more convenient and effective than standard interferon. Although it does not develop resistance as do many of the oral antivirals, it is poorly tolerated and requires close monitoring. PEG IFN is estimated to cost about $18,000 {{per year in the}} United States, compared to $2,500-8,700 for the oral medications; however, its treatment duration is 48 weeks as opposed to the oral antivirals, which require indefinite treatment for most patients (minimum 1 year). PEG IFN is not effective in patients with high levels of viral activity and cannot be used in immunosuppressed patients or those with cirrhosis.|$|E
25|$|Estrogen {{is one of}} the {{two major}} sex hormones in XX chromosomed {{individuals}} (the other being progesterone), and is responsible for the development and maintenance of feminine secondary sexual characteristics, such as breasts, wide hips, and a feminine pattern of fat distribution. Estrogens act by binding to and activating the estrogen receptor (ER), their biological target in the body. A variety of different forms of estrogen are available and used medically. The most common estrogens used in transgender women include estradiol (which is the predominant natural estrogen in women) and estradiol esters such as estradiol valerate and estradiol cypionate (which are prodrugs of estradiol). Conjugated equine estrogens (CEEs), marketed as Premarin, and ethinylestradiol are also sometimes used, but this is becoming less common. Estrogens may be administered orally, sublingually, transdermally (via patch), topically (via gel), by intramuscular or <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>injection,</b> or by an implant.|$|E

25|$|Disadvantages of the {{axillary}} block include inadequate anesthesia in {{the distribution}} of the musculocutaneous nerve. This nerve supplies motor function to the biceps, brachialis, and coracobrachialis muscles and one of its branches supplies sensation to the skin of the forearm. If the musculocutaneous nerve is missed, {{it may be necessary to}} block this nerve separately. This can be accomplished by using a peripheral nerve stimulator to identify the location of the nerve as it passes through the coracobrachialis muscle. The intercostobrachial nerves (which are branches of the second and third intercostal nerves) are also frequently missed with the axillary block. Because these nerves supply sensation to the skin of the medial and posterior aspects of the arm and axilla, a tourniquet on the arm may be poorly tolerated in such cases. <b>Subcutaneous</b> <b>injection</b> of local anesthetic over the medial aspect of the arm in the axilla helps patients tolerate an arm tourniquet by blocking these nerves.|$|E
25|$|Several analogs {{of human}} insulin are available. These insulin analogs {{are closely related}} to the human insulin structure, and were {{developed}} for specific aspects of glycemic control in terms of fast action (prandial insulins) and long action (basal insulins). The first biosynthetic insulin analog was developed for clinical use at mealtime (prandial insulin), Humalog (insulin lispro), it is more rapidly absorbed after <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>injection</b> than regular insulin, with an effect 15minutes after injection. Other rapid-acting analogues are NovoRapid and Apidra, with similar profiles. All are rapidly absorbed due to amino acid sequences that will reduce formation of dimers and hexamers (monomeric insulins are more rapidly absorbed). Fast acting insulins do not require the injection-to-meal interval previously recommended for human insulin and animal insulins. The other type is long acting insulin; the first of these was Lantus (insulin glargine). These have a steady effect for an extended period from 18 to 24hours. Likewise, another protracted insulin analogue (Levemir) is based on a fatty acid acylation approach. A myristyric acid molecule is attached to this analogue, which associates the insulin molecule to the abundant serum albumin, which in turn extends the effect and reduces the risk of hypoglycemia. Both protracted analogues need to be taken only once daily, and are used for type 1 diabetics as the basal insulin. A combination of a rapid acting and a protracted insulin is also available, making it more likely for patients to achieve an insulin profile that mimics that of the body´s own insulin release.|$|E
500|$|Interferon beta-1a is {{injected}} either weekly (intramuscular injection) {{or three times}} a week (<b>subcutaneous</b> <b>injection)</b> depending on commercial formulations, while interferon beta-1b {{is injected}} subcutaneously every second day. In 2014, a pegylated form of interferon beta-1a was introduced with the brand name Plegridy, which is available as a <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>injection.</b> This peginterferon beta 1-a attaches polyethylene glycol to the interferon molecules allowing longer lasting biological effects in the body while decreasing the frequency of administration to once every two weeks. [...] Interferon beta balances the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory agents in the brain, and reduces the number of inflammatory cells that cross the blood–brain barrier. Overall, therapy with interferon beta leads to a reduction of neuron inflammation. Moreover, it is also thought to increase the production of nerve growth factor and consequently improve neuronal survival.|$|E
