50|$|The <b>strontium</b> <b>unit</b> is a unit used {{to measure}} the amount of {{radioactivity}} from strontium-90, a radionuclide found in nuclear fallout, in a subject's body. Since the human body absorbs strontium as if it were calcium, incorporating it into the skeleton, its presence is very common. One <b>strontium</b> <b>unit</b> is equal to one picocurie from strontium-90 per gram of calcium (37 becquerels per kilogram) in the subject's skeleton.|$|E

40|$|Summary {{statements}} are given of significant findings {{related to the}} distribution characteristics, and biological availability of fall-out debris originating from testing programs at the Nevada Test Site during the past decade. The delineation of fall-out patterns has been accomplished {{by the use of}} aenial and ground monitoring surveys. Only about 25 % of the total amount of fission products produced by tower-supported detonations were deposited within distances corresponding to fall-out time of H + 12 hr; a much smaller quantity was deposited by halloon-supported detonations. Fall-out particles less than 44 (For in diameter are presumed to be of the greatest biological significance. About 30 % of the fall-out radioactivity from tower-supported detonations was contained in the 0 to 44 (For particles as compared to almost 70 % for balloon-supported detonations. Fall-out debris from halloon- supported detonations was also much more water and acid soluble than was the debris from towel-supported detonations. The those calculated by the T/sup - 1. //sup 2 / relationship. Fall- out radioactivity is apparently confined to the first 2 in. of the soil surface unless the surface has been mechanically disturbed. Most of the fall-out debris that was redistributed by various environmental factors after original deposition consisted of particles < 44 (For in diameter; the particles in this size range also represented the predominant contamination on plant foliage. Sr/ sup 90 / levels in surface soil ranged from 31. 9 to 142 mc/sq. mile in virgin areas near known fall-out pattern midlines and from 7. 5 to 22. 7 mc/sq. mile in agricultural areas that in some cases did not coincide with fall-out pattern midlines. The accumulation of radioiodine by native animals was observed to be a function of distance from GZ. Ba/sup 140 /, Y/sup 91 /, Sr/sup 89 /, and Sr/sup 90 / were major bone contaminants. Post-series sampling of native aminals indicated that the accumulation of Sr/sup 89 / was also a function of distance from the point of detonation; however, the Sr/sup 90 / accumulation by animals correlated poorly with the <b>strontium</b> <b>unit</b> levels in soils. The <b>strontium</b> <b>unit</b> levels increased in milk immediately following contamition of the farm with fall-out debris and then decreased with time as well as the amount of strontium associated with the cattle's diet. Observations during the past decade indicate that less than 10 % of the total strontium produced from nuclear detonations at NTS has been deposited with 200 miles from the point of detonation.

40|$|International audienceA new {{strontium}} uranyl oxyfluoride, [(UO 2) 4 F 13][Sr 3 (H 2 O) 8](NO 3) ·H 2 O, was synthesized under hydrothermal conditions. The single-crystal X-ray {{structure was}} determined. This compound crystallizes in the triclinic space group P 1 ̅ (No. 2), with unit cell parameters a = 10. 7925 (16) Å, b = 10. 9183 (16) Å, c = 13. 231 (2) Å, α = 92. 570 (8) °, β = 109. 147 (8) °, γ = 92. 778 (8) °, V = 1468. 1 (4) Å 3, and Z = 2. The structure is built from uranyl-containing chains of tetrameric units of corner-sharing UO 2 F 5 pentagonal bipyramids. These chains are linked through trimeric <b>strontium</b> <b>units</b> to form strontium–uranyl oxyfluoride layers further assembled by nitrate groups. The interlayer space {{is occupied by}} free water molecules. This compound was characterized by spectroscopic methods, especially 19 F NMR highlighting the many different fluoride sites. Structural relationships with other uranyl oxyfluorides were investigated through the different F/O ratios, the structural building unit, and the structural arrangement...|$|R
40|$|The rapidly {{expanding}} use of high volume hydraulic fracture stimulation during development of unconventional gas reservoirs {{such as the}} Marcellus Shale in northeastern North America has lead to concerns about potential migration or displacement of high TDS (total dissolved solids) fluids from the target formation or overlying units into shallow aquifers. Typical water quality monitoring methods {{may be unable to}} differentiate between contamination sources, behave non-conservatively, or require the addition of synthetic chemical tracers. Natural strontium isotope signatures (87 Sr/ 86 Sr) can be used to distinguish produced waters from the Marcellus Shale from other potential regional contaminants. The research objective of this study, located at the National Energy Technology Laboratory Greene County Site in southwestern Pennsylvania, was to test the assumption that hydraulic fracturing is confined to the target formation, and that injected and formation waters do not migrate to overlying <b>units.</b> <b>Strontium</b> isotope compositions were determined for produced waters taken over a period of approximately four months before and fourteen months after hydraulic fracturing from horizontal wells drilled into the Marcellus Shale and from overlying vertical Upper Devonian/Lower Mississippian (UD/LM) gas-producing wells. Water samples from a nearby spring were also collected to analyze the local ground water geochemistry and test the sensitivity of Sr isotopes as an indicator of brine incursions into fresh water aquifers. The results indicate that there was no significant post-hydraulic fracturing migration of Marcellus-related fluids or displacement of UD/LM brines into shallower units during the study period, and demonstrated that Sr isotopes can detect very small incursions of brine (< 0. 001 %) into groundwater, often at a more sensitive level than shifts in elemental concentrations. The large difference in Sr content between the Marcellus brines and the UD/LM brines allows for detectable isotopic shifts in UD/LM 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios with as little as ~ 1 % incursion of Marcellus fluids. Strontium isotopes have the potential to serve as an excellent long-term monitoring tool...|$|R
