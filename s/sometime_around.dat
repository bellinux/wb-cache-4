5|$|Hu {{retired from}} public life {{and went into}} {{seclusion}} in 1646, {{after the end of}} the Ming dynasty. Xiao Yuncong and Lü Liuliang recorded visiting him during his later years, in 1667 and 1673 respectively.

5|$|Another idea tied to 2012 {{involved}} a geomagnetic reversal (often incorrectly {{referred to as}} a pole shift by proponents), possibly triggered by a massive solar flare, that would release an energy equal to 100billion atomic bombs. This belief was supposedly supported by observations that the Earth's magnetic field was weakening, which could precede a reversal of the north and south magnetic poles, and the arrival of the next solar maximum, which was expected <b>sometime</b> <b>around</b> 2012.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sometime</b> <b>around</b> 3:00 PM local time, an {{emergency}} drivers' meeting {{was called by}} series director Brian Barnhart. After the meeting ended, Randy Bernard met with the media.

5|$|The barn {{was built}} <b>sometime</b> <b>around</b> 1871, {{possibly}} even before, and is constructed {{of the same}} soft brick that makes up {{the exterior of the}} home. Tradition in the Glidden family holds that the barn, like the house itself, was designed and built by prominent local carpenter Jacob Haish. The famous barn, one of DeKalb County's oldest remaining, stands a full two-stories high, measuring around 50feet (15m) tall, with a width of 30feet (9m).|$|E

50|$|Whether {{there is}} any truth in the legend or not Robert Fitzhamon seems to have seized control of the {{lowlands}} of Glamorgan and Gwynllwg <b>sometime</b> from <b>around</b> 1089 to 1094. His key strongholds were Cardiff Castle, which already may have been built, {{on the site of}} an old Roman fort, new castles at Newport, and at Kenfig.

5|$|The {{proposed}} {{migration of}} speakers of the Proto-Nahuan language into the Mesoamerican region {{has been placed}} at <b>sometime</b> <b>around</b> AD 500, {{towards the end of}} the Early Classic period in Mesoamerican chronology. Before reaching the Mexican Plateau, pre-Nahuan groups probably spent a period of time in contact with the Corachol languages Cora and Huichol of northwestern Mexico (which are also Uto-Aztecan).|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} glaciations further {{modified}} the region starting about 2 to 3 {{million years ago}} and ending <b>sometime</b> <b>around</b> 10,000 BP. At least four major glaciations {{have occurred in the}} Sierra Nevada, locally called the Sherwin (also called the pre-Tahoe), Tahoe, Tenaya, and Tioga. The Sherwin glaciers were the largest, filling Yosemite and other valleys, while later stages produced much smaller glaciers. A Sherwin-age glacier was almost surely responsible for the major excavation and shaping of Yosemite Valley and other canyons in the area.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Grayson {{constructed}} Grayson's Tavern in Danville <b>sometime</b> <b>around</b> 1785. The asymmetrical, ell-shaped building faces south onto Walnut Street with a {{front entrance}} {{on the south}} and a side entrance on the west, which opens onto Constitution Square. The Mary Akin Memorial Herb Garden, located behind Grayson's Tavern, features a variety of herbs that were commonly cultivated in the area during the late 18th and early 19th century, including chives, fennel, honeysuckle, lavender, rosemary, sage, and thyme. The garden is maintained by the Garden Club of Danville and named for one of its long-time members.|$|E

From the coinage, it appears very likely that Laodice was co-regent with Mithridates IV. Coins from the joint reign of Laodice and Mithridates IV display a fine double portrait, and they adapted a Ptolemaic model for coinage.|$|R
50|$|Caltoris cahira, {{the colon}} swift, is {{a species of}} skipper {{butterfly}} found in Asia.

5|$|Geoffrey {{was the son}} of Hugh of Briel and Alice of Villehardouin, a {{daughter}} of the Prince of Achaea, Geoffrey I of Villehardouin. The family, which hailed from Briel-sur-Barse in the French province of Champagne, is variously named in the sources, e.g. Brieres or Prieres (Μπριέρες or Πριέρης in Greek), Bruières, Briers, Briel or Brielle. Geoffrey's father inherited the Barony of Karytaina <b>sometime</b> <b>around</b> 1222 from his brother, Renaud of Briel. The Barony was the third largest (after Akova and Patras) in the Principality of Achaea, counting 22 knights' fiefs and being responsible for keeping watch over the rebellious inhabitants of the mountainous Skorta area.|$|E
5|$|However, Sitchin, {{who died}} in 2010, denied any {{connection}} between his work and Lieder's claims. In 2007, partly in response to Lieder's proclamations, Sitchin published a book, The End of Days, which set {{the time for the}} last passing of Nibiru by Earth at 556 BC, which would mean, given the object's supposed 3,600-year orbit, that it would return <b>sometime</b> <b>around</b> AD 2900. He did however say that he believed that the Annunaki might return earlier by spaceship, and that the timing of their return would coincide with the shift from the astrological Age of Pisces to the Age of Aquarius, sometime between 2090 and 2370.|$|E
5|$|Hugh {{afterwards}} became archdeacon of York and {{treasurer of}} York, <b>sometime</b> <b>around</b> 1143, probably through the patronage of William FitzHerbert {{while he was}} serving his first term as Archbishop of York. While treasurer, {{he was a member}} of the party at York that wanted to elect Hilary as archbishop after William FitzHerbert's deposition in 1147. The successful candidate was Henry Murdac, the Abbot of Fountains, who was supported by the bishops of Durham and Carlisle, William of St. Barbara and Æthelwold respectively. Murdac excommunicated Hugh, who returned the gesture.|$|E

This is undone by the New Warriors Nova, Marvel Man (Marvel Boy's alternate counterpart), Firestar, and Dwayne Taylor (who is not Night Thrasher in this reality). The New Warriors, together with a few Psionex members, the Fantastic Four, and the Silver Surfer, fight a revitalized Terrax <b>sometime</b> after. <b>Around</b> this time, Silhouette joins, and the New Warriors meet Avenger Rage and solo hero Darkhawk. The Left Hand has also begun collecting random superpowered individuals for a team he names the Folding Circle, one member being Silhouette's brother Midnight's Fire.|$|R
5|$|Prior to {{the early}} eighteenth century, hunting was mostly by {{indigenous}} Indonesians. Legend has it that sometime in the early eighteenth century, around 1712, Captain Christopher Hussey, while cruising for right whales near shore, was blown offshore by a northerly wind, where he encountered a sperm whale pod and killed one. Although the story may not be true, sperm whales were indeed soon exploited by American whalers. Judge Paul Dudley, in his Essay upon the Natural History of Whales (1725), states that one Atkins, ten or twelve years in the trade, {{was among the first}} to catch sperm whales <b>sometime</b> <b>around</b> 1720 off the New England coast.|$|E
5|$|Æthelwig (c. 1013–16 February {{in either}} 1077 or 1078) was an Abbot of Evesham {{before and during}} the Norman Conquest of England. Born <b>sometime</b> <b>around</b> 1010 or 1015, he was elected abbot in 1058. Known for his legal expertise, he {{administered}} estates for Ealdred, the Bishop of Worcester prior to his election as abbot. After his election, he appears to have acted as Ealdred's deputy, and was considered as a possible successor when Ealdred was elected Archbishop of York. Æthelwig worked during his abbacy to recover estates that had been lost to Evesham, as well as acquiring more estates.|$|E
5|$|Dannemann, {{the only}} {{eyewitness}} to Hendrix's final hours, said that sometime after 3 a.m., she prepared two tuna fish sandwiches for them after arriving {{back at her}} basement apartment. Around 4 a.m., Hendrix, struggling with insomnia after having consumed amphetamines hours earlier, asked her for sleeping tablets. She later said she refused his request hoping he would fall asleep naturally. Dannemann said she surreptitiously took a sleeping tablet <b>sometime</b> <b>around</b> 6 a.m., with Hendrix still awake. She awoke sometime between 10 and 10:20a.m. to find him sleeping normally in bed next to her. She said she then left to purchase cigarettes, and when she returned around 11 a.m., found him in bed breathing, although unconscious and unresponsive. She telephoned for an ambulance at 11:18a.m. and one arrived at 11:27a.m.|$|E

In 1965 the station was sold to Group One Broadcasting of Akron, owner of WAKR. During the mid 1960s WONE was known as [...] "Channel 98," [...] {{and it was one}} of Dayton's two popular Top 40 stations, the other being WING.

2500|$|Little {{is known}} about Lambe's early life, {{aside from the fact}} he was a writing tutor for {{children}} in Worcestershire. <b>Sometime</b> after <b>around</b> 1600 Lambe established a reputation as a [...] "cunning man" [...] – that is, someone well-versed in astrology and magic. [...] Calling himself [...] "Doctor Lambe" [...] (though he was not a licensed physician), he claimed that he could read fortunes, identify diseases, repel witchcraft, and locate missing or stolen items with his crystal ball. [...] Rumors also emerged that he was skilled in the dark art of conjuration.

50|$|In {{the early}} 17th century, natural {{philosophers}} were seeking new information to replace Aristotelianism {{that had been}} popular for centuries. Various European philosophers adopted {{what came to be}} known as mechanical philosophy <b>sometime</b> between <b>around</b> 1610 to 1650, which described the universe and its contents as a kind of large-scale mechanism, a philosophy that explained the universe is made with matter and motion. This mechanical philosophy was based on Epicureanism, and the work of Leucippus and his pupil Democritus and their atomism, in which everything in the universe, including a person's body, mind, soul and even thoughts, was made of atoms; very small particles of moving matter. During the early part of the 17th century, the atomistic portion of mechanical philosophy was largely developed by Gassendi, René Descartes and other atomists.|$|R
5|$|Robert was {{probably}} one of the sons of Gilbert de Gant, who is mentioned in the Domesday Book. Gilbert was from Flanders and came to England during 1069. Gilbert, who died around 1095, was married to Alice, daughter of Hugh de Montfort. Robert's conjectured siblings were Emma– wife of Alan de Percy, Hugh de Montfort-sur-Risle, Gilbert de Gant– who died before his father, and Walter de Gant. If Robert was a son of Gilbert, he was a younger son, probably the youngest of the four brothers, and probably was born <b>sometime</b> <b>around</b> 1085, as his supposed parents married about 1075 and there were older siblings. Robert is often confused in the historical records with another Robert, son of Walter. Robert {{was probably}} also the uncle of Gilbert de Gant, later Earl of Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|Schubert {{probably}} began sketching the sonatas <b>sometime</b> <b>around</b> {{the spring}} months of 1828; the final versions {{were written in}} September. These months also saw {{the appearance of the}} Three Piano Pieces, D. 946, the Mass in E-flat major, D. 950, the String Quintet, D. 956, and the songs published posthumously as the Schwanengesang collection (D. 957 and D. 965A), among others. The final sonata was completed on September 26, and two days later, Schubert played from the sonata trilogy at an evening gathering in Vienna. In a letter to Probst (one of his publishers), dated October 2, 1828, Schubert mentioned the sonatas amongst other works he had recently completed and wished to publish. However, Probst was not interested in the sonatas, and by November 19, Schubert was dead.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sometime</b> <b>around</b> 1285, Braose {{confirmed}} {{grants of}} land by his ancestors {{to the religious}} house of Sele Priory. In 1286 Braose was in the king's service, for unspecified duties overseas. It is possible that these included accompanying the king, Edward I, to Paris where Edward performed homage to the new French king, Philip IV, for Edward's French lands. Braose {{played a significant role}} in King Edward's Welsh wars. In the winter of 1287–8 he commanded the force blockading Emlyn castle. His men also provided the escort for the transport of a huge siege engine from Dryslwyn to Emlyn. The arrival of the engine, with 480 great stones as ammunition, persuaded the defenders of the castle to surrender peaceably.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{several days}} of lengthy delays, Challenger finally lifted off at 16:38:00 UTC on 28 January 1986. Her three main engines were ignited at T-6.6 seconds, and at T-0 the solid rocket {{boosters}} were ignited, lifting the shuttle stack off launchpad 39-B at Kennedy Space Center. Almost immediately, cameras recording the launch registered the presence of smoke at the field joint next to the attachment strut on the right-hand SRB, indicating {{the failure of the}} O-rings that were supposed to seal the joint against the [...] "blow-by" [...] of hot gases from the boosters. However, <b>sometime</b> at <b>around</b> T+2 seconds, a piece of solid fuel from inside the booster moved inside the joint and provided a temporary seal against the blow-by, allowing the launch to proceed normally for around forty seconds.|$|R
