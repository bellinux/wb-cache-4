It was an {{important}} matter {{to determine whether the}} chlorine was a primary result, or only a <b>secondary</b> <b>product,</b> due to the action of the oxygen evolved from water at the anode upon the muriatic acid; i.e. whether the muriatic acid was electrolyzable, and if so, whether the decomposition was definite.|$|E

The {{ordinary}} protoxide of antimony, {{which consists}} of one proportional of metal and {{one and a half}} of oxygen, was subjected to the action of the electric current in a green-glass tube (789.), surrounded by a jacket of platina foil, and heated in a charcoal fire. The decomposition began and proceeded very well at first, apparently indicating, according to the general law (679. 697.), that this substance was one containing such elements and in such proportions as made it amenable {{to the power of the}} electric current. This effect I have already given reasons for supposing may be due to the presence of a true protoxide, consisting of single proportionals (696. 693.). The action soon diminished, and finally ceased, because of the formation of a higher oxide of the metal at the positive electrode. This compound, which was probably the peroxide, being infusible and insoluble in the protoxide, formed a crystalline crust around the positive electrode; and thus insulating it, prevented the transmission of the electricity. Whether, if it had been fusible and still immiscible, it would have decomposed, is doubtful, because of its departure from the required composition (697.). It was a very natural <b>secondary</b> <b>product</b> at the positive electrode (779.). On opening the tube it was found that a little antimony had been separated at the negative electrode; but the quantity was too small to allow of any quantitative result being obtained[A].|$|E

40|$|Since the United Nations {{introduced}} the nonsymmetrical make-use input-output (I-O) tables in 1968, {{there have been}} on-going discussions about ways to translate them into symmetric I-O tables.
