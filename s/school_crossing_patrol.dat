500|$|Carlton Hill Primary School {{was built}} by the Local {{education}} authority in 1963. It is on the boundary of the conservation area, between Sussex Street and Carlton Hill (the road) {{on the west side}} of Tilbury Place, and is well screened by trees. It has a tall wooden fence that, according to the council's Conservation Area Character Statement, [...] "visually intrudes on the approach to the conservation area and harms its setting". It recommends replacing the fence with a flint wall. The school adjoins the site that is being redeveloped for the new American Express headquarters: the company paid the school £300,000 (a condition of the council's approval of the planning application) to compensate for the effect on its playground, which will be overlooked by the building, and the building contractor Sir Robert McAlpine has paid for a <b>school</b> <b>crossing</b> <b>patrol</b> officer to help children cross Carlton Hill safely during the construction period.|$|E
2500|$|In the 'Asda price' campaign, {{customers}} tap their trouser pocket twice, {{producing a}} 'chinking' sound as the coins that Asda's low prices have supposedly left {{in their pockets}} knock together. The pocket tap ads were launched in 1977 {{and over the next}} 30 years, a range of celebrities have been [...] "tappers", including from 1978, actors Richard Beckinsale, Paula Wilcox and James Bolam. And later, Julie Walters, and football player Michael Owen. In the late 1970s, adverts also included Sitcom actor Leonard Rossiter. In 1980, Carry On actress Hattie Jacques appeared in the advert as a <b>school</b> <b>crossing</b> <b>patrol</b> officer. Between 1981 and 1985, Asda used the slogan 'All Together Better' in conjunction with the 'Asda Price' pocket tap campaign in TV commercials and newspaper and magazine advertisements. When the new green capitalised ASDA logo started to appear from 1985, in early 1986 onwards and until early 1989, two slogans were used. The first, 'You'd be off your trolley to go anywhere else', was replaced in 1987 by 'One trip and you're laughing'. Celebrities including Joanna Lumley, Harry Enfield, Victoria Wood and Julie Walters featured in these adverts pushing their trolleys past Asda counter displays filmed in more 'exotic' locations to show the broad range of fresh food products that Asda offered from countries such as France and Italy.|$|E

30|$|Guidelines and {{implementation}} methods for traffic control devices in school zones do exist, but these rules vary {{from country to}} country. In the US, Part 7 of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) states the principles and standards for controlling traffic in school zones. These principles and standards also provide information on the appropriate design, application, and maintenance of various traffic control devices (including adult <b>school</b> <b>crossing</b> guards, student <b>patrols</b> and grade-separated crossings, school area speed limits and signage and so on).|$|R

The Kings Cross detectives received payments akin to a [...] "rent" [...] from individuals like Bill Bayeh, Stave Hardas and [...] "Fat" [...] George; the payments totalled thousands of dollars per week, collected by Sergeant Trevor Haken and shared amongst the six detective sergeants and the chief detective (Chook Fowler). This corrupt practice was known in police circles as [...] "the laugh".|$|R

5000|$|In the United Kingdom, {{a fine of}} £100 {{and three}} licence penalty points is given to those failing to give way at the crossings. Such a penalty has {{attracted}} criticisms of leniency {{when compared to other}} countries which enforce fines of up to £2,000. For failing to give way at a zebra crossing patrolled by a <b>school</b> <b>crossing</b> <b>patrol</b> ("lollipop man/lady" [...] as they are commonly called), however, the penalty rises to £1,000 and a minimum of three licence points, with the possibility even of disqualification. In the United Kingdom, motorists have to stop for a crossing patrol, even when it is not on a pedestrian crossing.|$|E

5000|$|In Australia and the United Kingdom, {{a school}} {{crossing}} supervisor or <b>school</b> <b>crossing</b> <b>patrol</b> officer is {{commonly known as}} a lollipop man or lollipop lady, because of the modified circular stop sign he or she carries, which resembles a large lollipop.The term was coined in the 1960s when road safety awareness programmes were rolled out in schools throughout the UK and the crossing patrols were introduced by the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1967. [...] Ventriloquist John Bouchier visited schools nationwide with his ventriloquist dummy to help make children more aware of road safety. During these visits John's main character, a young boy named Charlie, referred to crossing patrol officers as [...] "Lollipop men" [...] for the first time. The term became widely used very quickly and has crossed into popular culture, both in the folk world (the common morris-dance tune [...] "The Lollipop Man" [...] has lewd lyrics in one tradition), and in the pop world (see the song by the band Sweet). [...] Research in the UK has revealed that crossing guards ('lollipoppers') are seen as the safest school crossing option by parents and children, with nine out of ten (92 per cent) believing that every school should have one.|$|E
