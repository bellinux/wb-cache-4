40|$|Abstract. Following {{last two}} years ’ {{workshop}} on dynamic languages at the ECOOP conference, the Dyla 2007 workshop was a successful and popular event. As its name implies, the workshop’s focus was on dynamic languages and their applications. Topics and discussions at the workshop included macro expansion mechanisms, extension of the method lookup algorithm, language interpretation, reflexivity and languages for mobile ad hoc networks. The main goal of this workshop was to bring together different dynamic language communities and favouring cross communities interaction. Dyla 2007 was organised as a full day meeting, partly devoted to presentation of submitted position papers and partly devoted to tool demonstration. All accepted papers can be downloaded from the workshop’s web site.

40|$|Abstract—Despite the {{consequent}} development of {{solar thermal systems}} in many countries, there are many difficulties which {{to a large extent}} hamper the implementation of these products. The <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> <b>discussions</b> of the R & D seminar organized by ADEME 1 in Sophia Antipolis (27 – 28 April 2004) about "the need for innovation in solar thermal", states that solar thermal systems currently available in the market are added to the building without real integration. The problems, both technical and aesthetic, are the obvious obstacles to the development of this type of systems. For these reasons, in the frame of the present work, a new flat plate solar collector with high building integration and a prototype of this collector were developed. A numerical thermal model, developed in Matlab® environment by using a finite difference model was validated. Then, a modelling of the solar system was realized and the performance of the proposed system was optimized for various solar collector configurations.

40|$|The {{complexity}} of standard medical treatment for heart failure is growing, and such therapy typically involves 5 or more different medications. Given these pressures, {{there is increasing}} interest in harnessing cardiovascular biomarkers for clinical application to more effectively guide diagnosis, risk stratification, and therapy. It {{may be possible to}} realize an era of personalized medicine for heart failure treatment in which therapy is optimized and costs are controlled. The direct mechanistic coupling of biologic processes and therapies achieved in cancer treatment remains elusive in heart failure. Recent clinical trials and meta-analyses of biomarkers in heart failure have produced conflicting evidence. In this article, which comprises a <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> <b>discussions</b> from the Global Cardiovascular Clinical Trialists Forum held in Paris, France, we offer a brief overview of the background and rationale for biomarker testing in heart failure, describe opportunities and challenges from a regulatory perspective, and summarize current positions from government agencies in the United States and European Union. ...|$|E
