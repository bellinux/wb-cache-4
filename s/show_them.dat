5|$|Most restorations of ceratopsians <b>show</b> <b>them</b> with erect hindlimbs but semi-sprawling forelimbs, which {{suggest that}} they were not fast movers. But Paul and Christiansen (2000) argued that at least the later ceratopsians had upright forelimbs and the larger species may have been as fast as rhinos, which can run at up to 56km or 35 miles per hour.|$|E
5|$|The {{sizes of}} both moons are {{calculated}} {{with the assumption}} that they have the same infrared albedo as Haumea, which is reasonable as their spectra <b>show</b> <b>them</b> to have the same surface composition. Haumea's albedo has been measured by the Spitzer Space Telescope: from ground-based telescopes, the moons are too small and close to Haumea to be seen independently. Based on this common albedo, the inner moon, Namaka, which is a tenth the mass of Hiʻiaka, would be about 170km in diameter.|$|E
5|$|A {{highlight}} of the series in 1959 was when the Russians allowed Moore {{to be the first}} Westerner to see the photographic results of the Luna 3 probe, and to <b>show</b> <b>them</b> live on air. Less successful was the transmission of the Luna 4 probe, which ran into technical difficulties and around this time Moore famously swallowed a large fly; both episodes were live and Moore had to continue regardless. He was invited to visit the Soviet Union, where he met Yuri Gagarin, the first man to journey into outer space. For the fiftieth episode of The Sky at Night, in September 1961, Moore's attempt {{to be the first to}} broadcast a live direct telescopic view of a planet resulted in another unintended 'comedy episode', as cloud obscured the sky.|$|E

Originally, breed club shows did not allow people over the age of 16 to show POAs under saddle; adults could, however, <b>show</b> <b>them</b> in halter or driving classes. In 1973, the age limit for riders was raised to 18, and in 1987 it was decided that adults 19 and over could show horses two to four years old under saddle.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Rivens development, {{publisher}} Brøderbund was facing falling revenues as development costs rose. Two years into the project, Cyan still had nothing they could <b>show</b> <b>them.</b> Brøderbund's stock dropped from $60 a share to $22 in 1996, because of a delay in the publishing of Riven. The plan had been to ship the game {{in time for the}} 1996 holiday season; Riven was finally published on October 29, 1997. Even though Rivens sales were expected to be higher than any other game that holiday season, Brøderbund launched a $10million marketing campaign and developed a retail marketing partnership with Toshiba America. Anticipation for the game was high even among non-gamers, helped by web-based word of mouth and well-placed media coverage.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{relationship}} having declined from friendship to hatred, Bogdan-Pitești's style and his mundane interests are occasionally seen {{as sources of}} inspiration for Caragiale's only novel, Craii de Curtea-Veche (completed in 1928). Some have noted that Bogdan-Pitești has {{a lot in common}} with {{at least one of the}} three protagonists. He and his wife were both characters in Ion Vinea's novels Venin de mai ("May Venom") and Lunatecii ("The Lunatics")—Alexandru as Adam Gună, Domnica as wife Iada Gună. Both novels portray the Bogdans' cultural circle, allude to their influence in making young people reject all conventionalism, and <b>show</b> <b>them</b> promoting vice as virtue. This lifestyle has taken its toll on Adam Gună, who is a physical ruin and slowly loses his hold on reality. Vinea's books repeat claims that Bogdan-Pitești was abusing drugs, and that Domnica was originally a prostitute.|$|E

5|$|During the {{reproductive}} season, males {{of this and}} other fairywren species pluck yellow petals, which contrast with their plumage, and <b>show</b> <b>them</b> to female fairywrens. The petals often form part of a courtship display and are presented to a female in the male fairywren's own or another territory. Males sometimes show petals to females in other territories even outside the breeding season, presumably to promote themselves. Fairywrens are socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous: pairs will bond for life, though {{both males and females}} will regularly mate with other individuals; a proportion of young will have been fathered by males from outside the group. Young are often raised not by the pair alone, but with other males who also mated with the pair's female assisting.|$|E
5|$|Growing up, Bueno {{worked as}} a paperboy at the {{newsstand}} of his grandmother, Hortensia. In 1984, he attended concerts of the local band Chébere and was occasionally invited to join them on stage. The next year, {{he dropped out of}} school and started working at his father's record shop, where he sometimes sang for the customers. A friend of his father belonged to the local band Manto Negro and offered Rodrigo a spot in the band. This is where he formally started his career in music, signing his first contract and earning his first salary as a musician at age thirteen. Bueno had written songs since the age of ten, but he would not <b>show</b> <b>them</b> to his colleagues because of his grammar mistakes.|$|E

5|$|In 661, Wulfhere is {{recorded}} in the Chronicle as harrying Ashdown, in West Saxon territory. The Gewisse, {{thought to be the}} original group from which the West Saxons came, appear to have originally settled in the upper Thames valley, and what records survive of the 6th century <b>show</b> <b>them</b> active in that region. The Mercian resurgence under Wulfhere placed them under severe pressure. Also in the early 660s, the West Saxon see of Dorchester, in the same area, was divided, and a new bishopric set up at Winchester. This decision was probably a reaction to the advance of the Mercians into the traditional heartland of the West Saxons, leaving Dorchester dangerously close to the border. Within a few years, the Dorchester see was abandoned; the exact date is not known, but it was probably in the mid 660s.|$|E
5|$|In Basse Casamance, {{the rice}} cycle {{structures}} {{the lives of}} the population and plays a central economic and religious role. The Jola, who constitute 80 to 90% of the population of Basse Casamance, practice a unique form of rice cultivation. Descriptions of the techniques used in the late 15th century, recorded by the first Portuguese explorers, <b>show</b> <b>them</b> to be similar to those still in use, particularly with respect to flooding and transplanting. Only the varieties of rice have changed, from African rice to Asian rice, a separate species.|$|E
5|$|It {{appears that}} during the 18thcentury copper boom, it was {{customary}} throughout the Cornish mining industry to use bal maidens purely as casual labour. There are no records of bal maidens being contracted to a particular mine or paid a piece-rate {{for the amount of}} work done. Instead, mine accounts invariably <b>show</b> <b>them</b> being paid a fixed daily rate and employed only as and when they were needed. When poor weather conditions made surface-level work impossible, water shortages meant water-powered machinery could not operate, or accidents in the mines caused a temporary closure, the bal maidens would be suspended.|$|E

By August, they were well into development and had gotten permission to place the machine at the Tresidder student union building at Stanford as a test site. It was then that they received a call from Nolan Bushnell, who had heard of their project and wanted to <b>show</b> <b>them</b> his similar project he was working on.|$|E
5|$|River otters are not scavengers; {{they avoid}} {{consuming}} carrion. Northern river otters do not generally handle prey {{of a large}} size relative to themselves but there are occasions where they've been observed ambushing and killing adult common snapping turtles while the large turtles (which are roughly equal in average body weight to a river otter) are hibernating. Remains of the much larger American beaver {{have been found in}} otter scat in some regions, although most otter dietary studies in areas where otters and beaver are sympatric do not <b>show</b> <b>them</b> to be regular predators of beavers (despite the claims of fur-trappers that otters frequently hunt beavers) and perhaps only young beaver kits may be attacked.|$|E
5|$|Some {{relatives}} of Compsognathus, namely Sinosauropteryx and Sinocalliopteryx, have been preserved with {{the remains of}} simple feathers covering the body like fur, promoting some scientists to suggest that Compsognathus might have been feathered in a similar way. Consequently, many depictions of Compsognathus <b>show</b> <b>them</b> with coverings of downy proto-feathers. However, no feathers or feather-like covering have been preserved with Compsognathus fossils, in contrast to Archaeopteryx, which {{are found in the}} same sediments. Karin Peyer, in 2006, reported skin impressions preserved {{on the side of the}} tail starting at the 13th tail vertebra. The impressions showed small bumpy tubercles, similar to the scales found on the tail and hind legs of Juravenator. Additional scales had in 1901 been reported by Von Huene, in the abdominal region of the German Compsognathus, but Ostrom subsequently disproved this interpretation; in 2012 they were by Achim Reisdorf seen as plaques of adipocere, corpse wax.|$|E

Neil stated they brought to artists and DJ's working prototypes {{of the game}} and hardware to <b>show</b> <b>them</b> what the sampled music and final mixes sounded like, garnering interest from these groups. This led to securing of rights from several groups for their songs, though this did occur late in the development process. Mixing with celebrity DJ's was performed either though electronic communications, or at FreeStyleGames' studios or the homes or studios of the DJ's themselves; the team outlined the goals {{of the game and}} requested mixes that emphasized the gameplay featured, but avoided hampering the creativity of the artists.|$|E
5|$|Themistocles now {{developed}} a second strategy. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the Peloponnesus) {{would require the}} army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae. This could easily be blocked by the Greek hoplites, despite the overwhelming numbers of Persians; furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the Athenian and allied navies could block the straits of Artemisium. However, after the Tempe debacle, it was uncertain whether the Spartans {{would be willing to}} march out from the Peloponnesus again. To persuade the Spartans to defend Attica, Themistocles had to <b>show</b> <b>them</b> that the Athenians were willing to do everything necessary for the success of the alliance. In short, the entire Athenian fleet must be dispatched to Artemisium.|$|E
