The effects of heating time and heating temperature on {{the products were}} investigated. As a chelating ligand and template molecule, the <b>potassium</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>tartrate</b> {{plays a key role}} in the formation of hierarchically nanostructured HA. On the basis of experimental results, a possible mechanism based on soft-template and self-assembly was proposed for the formation and growth of the hierarchically nanostructured HA. Cytotoxicity experiments indicated that the hierarchically nanostructured HA had good biocompatibility. It was shown by in-vitro experiments that mesenchymal stem cells could attach to the hierarchically nanostructured HA after being cultured for 48 hours. Objective: The purpose of this study was to develop facile and effective methods for the synthesis of novel hydroxyapatite (HA) with hierarchical nanostructures assembled from independent and discrete nanobuilding blocks. Methods: A simple hydrothermal approach was applied to synthesize HA by using CaCl 2, NaH 2 PO 4, and <b>potassium</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>tartrate</b> at 200 &deg;C for 24 hours. The cell cytotoxicity of the hierarchically nanostructured HA was tested by MTT (3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Results: HA displayed the flower-like structure assembled from nanosheets consisting of nanorod building blocks. The <b>potassium</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>tartrate</b> was used as a chelating ligand, inducing the formation and self-assembly of HA nanorods. The heating time and heating temperature influenced the aggregation and morphology of HA. The cell viability did not decrease with the increasing concentration of hierarchically nanostructured HA added. Conclusion: A novel, simple and reliable hydrothermal route had been developed for the synthesis of hierarchically nanosized HA with flower-like structure assembled from nanosheets consisting of nanorod building blocks. The HA with the hierarchical nanostructure was formed via a soft-template assisted self-assembly mechanism. The hierarchically nanostructured HA has a good biocompatibility and essentially no in-vitro cytotoxicity. Keywords: hierarchical, biocompatibility, nanorods, nanosheet...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston University, 1940 The {{author has}} {{reported}} in a previous paper, {{the results of an}} investigation of the United States Pharmacopoeia XI method for the assay of Rochelle salt. In this investigation, it was found that all samples of Rochelle salt bought on the market, were below standard requirement by the official method, were below standard requirement when assayed by the official method. The United States Pharmacopocia XI requires that Rochelle salt contain no less that 99 percent of KNaC 4 H 6 O 6. 4 H 2 O. The results obtained indicated that the samples assayed were close to 90 percent. To account for this discrepancy the following possibilites were considered as probable explanations; (1) the official method gives erroneous results, (2) the samples were not of standard quality, and (3) the requirements were too high. Since the samples assayed were from large chemical companies, and all of them gave the same result, it was assumed that these samples were very likely representative of the Rochelle salt available, and would be of standard quality.
