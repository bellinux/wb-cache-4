50|$|A swageless {{terminal}} can {{be removed}} and re-used, unlike a <b>swaged</b> <b>terminal.</b> This makes them very popular in the marine industry as they enable a quick repair {{to be made to}} a damaged cable while out at sea. Removing them from the wire end also allows anything which the cable has been threaded through (headstay furler) to be removed for servicing, re-threaded and the fitting re-attached.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>swage</b> <b>terminal</b> is {{a product}} used to {{terminate}} wire. A swaging machine is used to terminate the wire. The wire is passed into a deep hole in the <b>swage</b> <b>terminal</b> which is then pressed onto the terminal by applying force. This type of product {{is used in the}} architectural and marine industries. There are many companies globally who manufacture <b>swage</b> <b>terminals</b> including Sta-Lok ...|$|R
25|$|Rigging parts include swageless <b>{{terminals}},</b> <b>swage</b> <b>terminals,</b> shackle toggle terminals and fail-safe wire rigging insulators.|$|R
50|$|As with <b>swage</b> <b>{{terminals}},</b> swageless terminals {{are available}} {{with a variety of}} different attachment methods; fixed clevis forks, toggling clevis forks, eyes and threaded studs (for insertion in a turnbuckle barrel).|$|R
2500|$|Standing rigging is 1 x 19 {{stainless}} steel wire rope (breaking strength [...] ) with <b>swage</b> <b>terminals,</b> {{stainless steel}} turnbuckles and chain plates. Running rigging is of Samson braid, including jib sheets and main sheet. Halyards are stainless steel having dacron rope tails.|$|R
50|$|The swageless {{terminal}} can {{be fitted}} by using hand tools, unlike a <b>swage</b> <b>terminal</b> {{which requires a}} special press, roller die or rotary hammer machine to crimp it onto a wire. This makes them very useful if the wire assembly must be made-up on site. A swageless terminal will work under constant loading and variable shock loading, making it stronger than the wire rope.|$|R
50|$|Most fore-and-aft rigged vessels {{have the}} {{following}} types of standing rigging: a forestay, a backstay, and {{upper and lower}} shrouds (side stays).Less common rigging configurations are diamond stays and jumpers. Both of these are used to keep a thin mast in column especially under the load of a large down wind sail or in strong wind.Rigging parts include swageless <b>terminals,</b> <b>swage</b> <b>terminals,</b> shackle toggle terminals and fail-safe wire rigging insulators.|$|R
40|$|AbstractCopper alloys {{are widely}} used in {{electrical}} circuits mainly due to their electrical conductivity. In electrical circuits, solder terminals are used to provide multiple electrical connections and <b>swage</b> type turret <b>terminals</b> are preferred owing to their high reliability under dynamic environments where the electrical systems are subjected to higher vibrations and line currents, {{as in the case}} of satellite launch vehicles. Owing to high machinability, free-cutting brass is preferred in the manufacture of such small sized terminals, which will be cold worked/swaged to the printed circuit boards. Improper selection of the composition of free-cutting brass can lead to cracking of the terminals, thereby affecting the reliability of the system. This paper describes cracking of turret terminals made of free cutting brass during swaging operation. The crack propagation tendency during cold working of brass turret terminals made from different compositions is studied through optical and scanning electron microscopy. Finally, composition for obtaining crack free <b>terminals</b> during <b>swaging</b> is suggested for applications involving cold swaging...|$|R
