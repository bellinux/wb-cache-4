Performance predictions are obtained by ANSYS CFX for an oil-free 4 / 5 lobed twin screw compressor with variable pitch rotors and uniform ‘N’ profile. A comparison with the performance of a compressor of the same rotor size and wrap angle, but with the uniform pitch rotors showed that the variable pitch rotors give better compression characteristics.

40|$|An {{algebraic}} grid generation {{algorithm is}} {{presented in this paper}} which enables the per- formance of twin screw compressors with variable rotor geometry to be predicted, by means of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). It is based on a method, previously developed by the authors, for compressors with standard uniform pitch rotors and con- stant cross-section profile, which has now been extended to include rotors with variable pitch and/or variable profile. By its use with the commercial CFD solver ANSYS CFX, it has been possible to obtain performance predictions for three variants of an oil-free 3 / 5 screw compressor, namely uniform helical rotors, variable pitch rotors and variable profile rotors. The variable pitch and variable profile rotors achieve steeper internal pres- sure rise and a larger discharge area for the same pressure ratio. Variable pitch rotors also showed lower leakage rates due to reduced <b>sealing</b> <b>line</b> length in the high pressure domain.

40|$|The {{most common}} type of twin screw {{machines}} are twin screw compressors. These normally contain rotors of uniform pitch and profile along the rotor length. However, in some cases such as in twin screw vacuum pumps with very large pressure ratios, the variable pitch rotors are often used to improve efficiency. The limited use of rotors with variable pitch and/or section profile is mainly due to manufacturing constraints. In order to analyse the performance of such machines by means of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), it is necessary to produce a numerical mesh capable of calculating 3 D transient fluid flows within their working domains. An algebraic grid generation algorithm applicable to unstructured grid, Finite Volume Method (FVM) for variable pitch and variable profile screw machines is described in this paper. The grid generation technique has been evaluated for an oil free air compressor with “N” profile rotors of 3 / 5 lobe configuration. The performance was obtained by calculations with commercial CFD code. The grid generation procedure provides mesh of the required quality and results from CFD calculations are presented to compare performance of constant pitch rotors, variable pitch rotors and variable profile rotors. The variable pitch and variable profile rotors achieve steeper internal pressure rise and a larger discharge area for the same pressure ratio. Variable pitch rotors achieve reduced <b>sealing</b> <b>line</b> length in high pressure domains...|$|E

The key challenge researched in this thesis concerns how to reduce space requirements and cost of a highly automated facility without sacrificing system maintainability, safety or throughput. For this study, any solution must utilize currently available technology. The thesis will review the basic research, concept development, layout development and solution refinement activities that lead to a final concept and recommendation. The key findings for this study include three strategies {{that led to a}} lower cost footprint that consumed less space. These strategies are: " Intelligent reduction of conveyance systems "Increased system flexibility" Increased automation density Additionally the study highlights how these strategies complement each other when addressing cost and space reduction challenges.

40|$|The rotor {{profiles}} of twin screw compressors {{have a significant}} influence on the compressor performance. Three different rotor profile design methods are derived mathematically and their limitations are addressed. This dissertation presents the complete theory and algorithm of the deviation function (DF) method for the twin screw compressor design. This method is based on conjugate pair design and generates new twin screw compressor profiles from generating curves derived by the deviation functions. The deviation functions used in this research are composed of the Bezier curves. The partially overlapped three-segment third-order Bezier curve-based deviation function is proposed to achieve the goal of minimizing the blowhole area along with shorter interlobe <b>sealing</b> <b>line</b> length. The complication of combining curves as the generating curves and determining values of parameters of those curves are problems for the rotor profile designs of twin screw compressors in industry. Thanks {{to the adoption of}} Bezier curves for the deviation functions, these problems can be avoided when the rotor pro-files of twin screw compressors are designed in this study. In addition, it helps discover a more diverse range of designs and thus leads to the more universal optimal results. Those advantages are emphasized by showing a variety of design examples and the improvement for the industry applications. Moreover, the effects of the lead non-uniformity of the twin screw compressor are investigated and the results are compared to the twin screw compressor with constant lead in this research. It is found that the twin screw compressor with increasing lead tends to reduce the leakage, and thus, the volumetric efficiency of this kind is improved, especially in the practical operating conditions when the working gas has a significant tendency to leak out of the compression chamber of the compressor...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} grid generation and numerical methods for predicting the flow in variable geometry, positive displacement screw machines. It has been shown, from a review of available literature, that the two main approaches available to generate deforming grids for the CFD analysis of 3 D transient flow in screw machines are algebraic and differential. Grids that maintain the cell count and connectivity, during solution, provide the highest accuracy and customised grid generation tools {{have the capability to}} accommodate large mesh deformations. For the analysis of screw rotors with a variable lead or varying profile, these techniques are suitable but are required to be developed further with new procedures that can define the three dimensional variation of geometry of the rotors onto the computational grid. An algebraic grid generation method was used for deforming grid generation of variable lead and varying profile rotors. Functions were developed for correlating a specified lead variation along the rotor axis with the grid spacing. These can be used to build a continuously variable lead with linear, quadratic or higher order functions. For variable profile rotors, a novel approach has been developed for three dimensional grid structuring. This can be used to specify a continuously variable rotor profile, a variable lead, and both internal and external rotor engagement, thus making it possible to generate rotor domains with conical and variable lead geometries. New grid distribution techniques were developed to distribute boundary points on the rotors from the fixed points on the rack and the casing. These can refine the grid in the region of interlobe leakage gaps between the rotors, produce a one to one connected interface between them and improve the cell quality. Inflation layers were applied and tested for mesh refinement near the rotor boundaries. Case studies have been presented to validate the proposed grid generation techniques and the results have been compared with experimental data. Simulated results agreed well with measured data and highlighted the conditions where deviations are highest. Results with variable geometry rotors showed that they achieve steeper internal pressure rise and a larger discharge port area could be used. With variable lead rotors the volumetric efficiency could be improved by reducing the <b>sealing</b> <b>line</b> length in the high pressure zone. Calculations with inflation layers showed that local velocities were better predicted but there was no substantial influence on the integral performance parameters...|$|E

This gasketless flange {{includes}} a groove and an annular lip that is machined {{in one of the}} flange being in contact with the other flange to form a <b>seal</b> <b>line</b> when the flanges are assembled. In this study, first, fundamental dimensions are examined for PVC-U to obtain the best sealing performance. Then, the effects of material difference and flange nominal size on the sealing performance of new gasketless flange are investigated for two types of materials, 0. 25 % carbon steel (S 25 C JIS) and unplasticized polyvinyl chloride (PVC-U JIS). It is found that the critical internal pressure where leakage appears is mainly controlled by the maximum normal stress at the annular lip for each material even if the flange nominal sizes are different. The gasketless flange made by PVC-U shows the higher critical internal pressure compared with the case of S 25 C if the same clamping forces are applied. The effect of stress relaxation for PVC-U on the sealing performance is also considered. Then, it may be concluded that this PVC-U gasketless flange also has good sealing performance...|$|R
