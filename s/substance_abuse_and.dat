5|$|Early in his career, Jim Henson's {{work was}} aimed at mature audiences. His {{television}} program Sam and Friends was designed for young adults. During this period, his characters often appeared on late-night, comedy television programs The Jimmy Dean Show and The Ed Sullivan Show. Throughout the 1960s, Jim Henson used his puppets for profane, irreverent comedy. These early Henson creations made references to <b>substance</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> sexual intercourse; The A.V.

5|$|Anderson et al. argue that, {{aside from}} acute care, {{emergency}} medicine can {{also play a}} significant role in public health. Vaccinations for many diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis can be administered by emergency departments, patients can be targeted for specific interventions such as counseling for <b>substance</b> <b>abuse,</b> <b>and</b> conditions like hypertension can be detected and treated. Emergency departments are excellent locations to train health care providers and to collect data, because of the high number of patients. Emergency medicine also improves public health by preventing secondary disease developing from an initial presentation (initial symptoms), and it serves as the first line of defense in disaster scenarios.|$|E

5|$|The {{residential}} school system harmed Indigenous children significantly by removing {{them from their}} families, depriving them of their ancestral languages, exposing many of them to physical and sexual abuse, and forcibly enfranchising them. Disconnected from their families and culture and forced to speak English or French, students who attended the {{residential school}} system often graduated unable to fit into either their communities or Canadian society. It ultimately proved successful in disrupting the transmission of Indigenous practices and beliefs across generations. The legacy of the system {{has been linked to}} an increased prevalence of post-traumatic stress, alcoholism, <b>substance</b> <b>abuse,</b> <b>and</b> suicide, which persist within Indigenous communities.|$|E
5|$|A further {{six years}} elapsed before Nine Inch Nails' fourth {{full-length}} album. With Teeth {{was released in}} May 2005, though it was leaked prior to its official release date.

5|$|Since medical {{literature}} began to describe homosexuality, {{it has often}} been approached from a view that sought to find an inherent psychopathology as the root cause, influenced by the theories of Sigmund Freud. Although he considered bisexuality inherent in all people, and said that most have phases of homosexual attraction or experimentation, exclusive same-sex attraction he attributed to stunted development resulting from trauma or parental conflicts. Much literature on mental health and lesbians centered on their depression, <b>substance</b> <b>abuse,</b> <b>and</b> suicide. Although these issues exist among lesbians, discussion about their causes shifted after homosexuality was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual in 1973. Instead, social ostracism, legal discrimination, internalization of negative stereotypes, and limited support structures indicate factors homosexuals face in Western societies that often adversely affect their mental health.|$|E
5|$|The Avalanche {{chose not}} to re-sign Fleury, and he joined the New York Rangers on a three-year {{contract}} worth $21million that included a club option for a fourth year at $7million. He touched off a wave of anger on signing with the Rangers when he claimed he was unappreciated in Calgary, comments he later stated were directed at the Flames' owners and not the team's fans, who he said always supported him. Fleury's first year in Manhattan was a disappointment. He scored only 15goals in 1999–2000, struggling {{under the pressure of}} trying to lead the Rangers into the playoffs and adapting to life in New York. After the season, he voluntarily entered a league-operated program that treats <b>substance</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> emotional problems, though he denied that either had any effect on his play.|$|E
5|$|Musically, Lovato is {{considered}} a pop, pop rock, and R artist. Lovato has received {{a considerable number of}} accolades, including an MTV Video Music Award, 13 Teen Choice Awards, five People's Choice Awards, an ALMA Award, and a Latin American Music Award. Outside the entertainment industry, Lovato has been involved with several social and environmental causes since the launch of her career. In May 2013, she was cited for her dedication as a mentor to teens and young adults with mental health challenges at a National Children's Mental Health Awareness Day hosted by the <b>Substance</b> <b>Abuse</b> <b>and</b> Mental Health Services Administration in Washington, D.C.. She has also become an advocate for the LGBT community, and women's rights. In 2014, she was announced as the Grand Marshal for LA Pride week, and that same year she became the face for the Human Rights Campaign's Americans for Marriage Equality Campaign. In April 2016, Lovato was honored with the GLAAD Vanguard Award for making a significant difference in promoting equal rights for LGBT people.|$|E
40|$|Organizational {{tolerance}} for discrimination against people who identify as transgender {{is a significant}} social justice issue affecting all organizations, including <b>substance</b> <b>abuse</b> counseling <b>and</b> human services organizations. <b>Substance</b> <b>abuse</b> counseling <b>and</b> human services organizations promote inclusive practices with people of various gender identities and expressions, yet there may be organizational climate factors that challenge inclusive practice. This exploratory study sought to address that gap by examining perceived organizational {{tolerance for}} transphobia within a cross-sectional sample of <b>substance</b> <b>abuse</b> counselor trainees completing an internship {{in the state of}} Texas. Overall, counselor trainees reported low tolerance of transphobia within their organizations. Yet, the sample offered insights concerning how people with nonbinary gender identity and expression may be otherwise ostracized within their <b>substance</b> <b>abuse</b> counseling <b>and</b> human services organizations. Discussion about how these experiences can influence practice, policy, education, and research in the <b>substance</b> <b>abuse</b> counseling <b>and</b> human services fields is presented for further consideration. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

5|$|The {{most common}} form of self-harm is using a sharp object to cut one's skin, but self-harm also covers a wide range of {{behaviours}} including burning, scratching, banging or hitting body parts, interfering with wound healing (dermatillomania), hair-pulling (trichotillomania) and the ingestion of toxic substances or objects. Behaviours associated with <b>substance</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> eating disorders are usually not considered self-harm because the resulting tissue damage is ordinarily an unintentional side effect. However, the boundaries are not always clearly defined and in some cases behaviours that usually fall outside the boundaries of self-harm may indeed represent self-harm if performed with explicit intent to cause tissue damage. Although suicide is not the intention of self-harm, the relationship between self-harm and suicide is complex, as self-harming behaviour may be potentially life-threatening. There is also an increased risk of suicide in individuals who self-harm and self-harm is found in 40–60% of suicides. However, generalising self-harmers to be suicidal is, in the majority of cases, inaccurate.|$|E
