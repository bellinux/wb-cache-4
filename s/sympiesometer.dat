By 1841 Hick was Deputy chairman and a Director with chairman John Hargreaves; the two families (Hick and Hargreaves) were linked by marriage in 1836.

50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1808 when Carpenter opened his first {{workshop}} on Inge Street in Birmingham. They manufactured many instruments and devices that use lenses. Over the years the company produced thermometers, microscopes, <b>sympiesometers,</b> spectacles, and Claude glasses. Carpenter's expertise in optics allowed {{him to be a}} significant figure in the development of other devices and the company would become well known for a variety of products. He quickly became a leading figure in the production of achromatic lenses, even supplying Peter Dollond, a renowned developer of the lenses. He made instruments for various opticians including John Benjamin Dancer who would for a time help to make some for Carpenter's company. By 1815 he had outgrown these premises and moved his manufacturing to Bath Row with a shop on New Street.|$|R
2500|$|The {{ship was}} one of the first to be fitted with the {{lightning}} conductor invented by William Snow Harris. FitzRoy spared no expense in her fitting out, which included 22 chronometers, and five examples of the <b>Sympiesometer,</b> a kind of mercury-free barometer patented by Alexander Adie which was favoured by FitzRoy as giving the accurate readings required by the Admiralty. To reduce magnetic interference with the navigational instruments, FitzRoy proposed replacing the iron guns with brass guns, but the Admiralty turned this request down. (When the ship reached Rio de Janeiro in April 1832, he used his own funds for replacements: the ship now had a [...] "six-pound boat-carronade" [...] on a turntable on the forecastle, two brass six-pound guns before the main-mast, and aft of it another four brass guns; two of these were nine-pound, and the other two six-pound.) ...|$|E

6000|$|Presently {{appeared}} {{a kind of}} barracoon, a large square of thick cane-work and thatch about eight feet high, the Fetish house of the [...] "Jinkimba" [...] or circumcised boys, who received us with unearthly yells. After a march of an hour and three quarters,'covering five indirect and three direct miles in a south-eastern rhumb, we reached Banza Nkaye, the royal village, where the <b>sympiesometer</b> showed 1430 feet. Our bearers yelled [...] "Abububu!" [...] showing that we had reached our destination, and the villagers answered with a cry of [...] "Abía-a-a!" [...] The entrance was triumphal: we left the river with a tail of fifty-six which had swelled to 150 ragged followers.|$|E
60|$|In {{a distant}} view a forest country is very monotonous, and no {{mountain}} I have ever ascended {{in the tropics}} presents a panorama equal to that from Snowdon, while the views in Switzerland are immeasurably superior. When boiling our coffee I took observations with a good boiling-point thermometer, {{as well as with}} the <b>sympiesometer,</b> and we then enjoyed our evening meal and the noble prospect that lay before us. The night was calm and very mild, and having made a bed of twigs and branches over which we laid our blankets, we passed a very comfortable night. Our porters had followed us after a rest, bringing only their rice to cook, and luckily we did not require the baggage they left behind them. In the morning I caught a few butterflies and beetles, and my friend got a few land-shells; and we then descended, bringing with us some specimens of the ferns and pitcher-plants of Padang-batu.|$|E
60|$|It {{was very}} {{striking}} {{to come out}} from the dark, cool, and shady forest in which we had been ascending since we started, on to this hot, open rocky slope where we seemed to have entered at one step from a lowland to an alpine vegetation. The height, as measured by a <b>sympiesometer,</b> was about 2,800 feet. We had been told we should find water at Padang-batu as we were exceedingly thirsty; but we looked about for it in vain. At last we turned to the pitcher-plants, but the water contained in the pitchers (about half a pint in each) was full of insects, and otherwise uninviting. On tasting it, however, we found it very palatable though rather warm, and we all quenched our thirst from these natural jugs. Farther on we came to forest again, but of a more dwarf and stunted character than below; and alternately passing along ridges and descending into valleys, we reached a peak separated from the true summit of the mountain by a considerable chasm. Here our porters gave in, and declared they could carry their loads no further; and certainly the ascent to the highest peak was very precipitous. But on the spot where we were there was no water, whereas it was well known {{that there was a}} spring close to the summit, so we determined to go on without them, and carry with us only what was absolutely necessary. We accordingly took a blanket each, and divided our food and other articles among us, and went on with only the old Malay and his son.|$|E

50|$|The <b>sympiesometer</b> {{consists}} of two parts. One is a traditional mercury thermometer {{that is needed to}} calculate the expansion or contraction of the fluid in the barometer proper. The other is the barometer, consisting of a J-shaped tube open at the lower end and closed at the top, with small reservoirs {{at both ends of the}} tube. The lower end of the J and its associated reservoir were filled with colored almond oil, while the upper portion and its reservoir were filled with hydrogen gas. Increasing air pressure would cause the oil to be pushed out of the lower reservoir and into the tube, compressing the hydrogen gas into the upper reservoir. The pressure was indicated by the position of the top of the oil. To correct for temperature, a sliding scale was used; the operator would first use the thermometer to set the scale and then measure the pressure from it.|$|E
