Jack continues {{to explain that}} John Locke blew up the submarine that was to take him home. Claire suddenly collapses with blood gushing from her face. Juliet takes Jack and Kate aside and tells them she knows what's wrong with Claire because she did it to her. At the camp, Juliet explains that Claire's immune system has turned against her due to a latent reaction to medication in her bloodstream. The medication was designed by Juliet to keep Claire alive during her pregnancy. She {{was brought to the}} island to find out why women couldn't have children. The mother's body treats the pregnancy as a foreign invader and the immune system attacks; every pregnant woman on the island has died. Claire was the first to survive even though she showed some of the symptoms.|$|E

25|$|I return herewith, under {{separate}} cover, the 'Pearl of Great Price.' The 'Book of Abraham,' it {{is hardly}} necessary to say, is a pure fabrication. Cuts 1 and 3 are inaccurate copies of well known scenes on funeral papyri, and cut 2 is a copy {{of one of the}} magical discs which in the late Egyptian period were placed under the heads of mummies. There were about forty of these latter known in museums and they are all very similar in character. Joseph Smith's interpretation of these cuts is a farrago of nonsense from beginning to end. Egyptian characters can now be read almost as easily as Greek, and five minutes' study in an Egyptian gallery of any museum <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to convince any educated man of the clumsiness of the imposture.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} part of the ritual, the aides seek {{repeatedly}} both to arouse the ritualist sexually as well as to exhaust him. The ritualist is generally passive in this regard. There is disagreement over whether sexual arousal is enough, or sexual orgasm must be eventually accomplished. Crowley and others argue that orgasm must be avoided. Although later practitioners conclude that orgasm does not need to be avoided, that was how Crowley originally formulated the ritual. Most practitioners agree with Crowley that every means of arousal may be used, such as physical stimulation, genital stimulation, psychological stimulation, devices (such as sex toys), or drugs (an entheogen like hashish, marijuana, or other aphrodisiacs). There <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> aides so that if one aide tires another may take his or her place. Eventually, the ritualist will tend to sink into sleep due to exhaustion.|$|E

[...] "The last Jackson hero(ine) has carried peacock feathers to the dance. Holier than Mahalia."

[...] Several local Social Credit Party Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) expressed dissatisfaction with {{the rate at which}} the work was progressing and the reasoning given by Highways Minister Clarence Copithorne. [...] He cited a labour shortage and the fact that provincial funds were being spread across multiple projects, and also the fact that drivers should not be subjected to overly lengthy construction zones. [...] The MLAs disagreed, saying that Alberta's oil and gas revenue <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to expedite Highway3 work, and that their constituents preferred for the work to be done sooner even if it meant longer stretches of the road would be under construction at a given time.|$|E

Jacob Clifton of Television Without Pity gave the episode an A+ rating, and jokingly {{stated that he}} [...] "didn't know why the Doctor was fucking around : he taught Physics at Coal Hill School way back in '63". Ahsan Haque of IGN gave the episode an 8.7 out of 10 ("Great") and commented that the episode had [...] "fantastic character moments" [...] and [...] "brilliant CGI effects", and that [...] "if you're {{willing to accept the}} Scooby-Doo storyline, then the strong nostalgic vibes present in this episode <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to carry this episode into a must-see category.", and K9 and Sarah-Jane alone made the episode worth watching for fans of the classic series.

500|$|In response, Duchesne gave what Nosanchuk writes was a [...] "well-reasoned argument", {{which the}} jury paid rapt {{attention}} to. Duchesne {{declared that the}} incident had been the cold, calculated murder of a defenceless group of innocent young people by an ex-convict, released only three weeks earlier and already known as an anti-social psychopath. The defendant had given wildly conflicting stories to different doctors, Duchesne said, yet had convinced each one. Duchesne {{said that this was}} possible as Lamb was highly intelligent and able to project a false front if it suited him. The prosecutor then moved off the topic of Lamb's mental state and focussed on the matter of criminal responsibility in general. Five out of the eight psychiatrists in the court, the prosecutor said, had testified that Lamb had understood on an intellectual level that shooting Chaykoski and Woloch would kill them, which he asserted <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to incur criminal responsibility, even taking the psychiatric evidence into account. Finding Lamb {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity, he reasoned, would provide an inexpedient precedent in Canadian law and cause a spate of similar insanity defence attempts.|$|E

2500|$|On September 24, while {{campaign}}ing in Surrey North, Stephen Harper's campaign team barred reporters from {{talking with the}} local Conservative candidate, Dona Cadman, who is Chuck Cadman's widow. The campaign team called in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), and ordered them to [...] "Keep [...] out" [...] while Cadman was taken away by staff. Harper spokesman Kory Teneycke later stated {{that he had not}} seen the incident, but the local candidates {{did not need to be}} interviewed, that [...] "Local candidates' priority is {{campaigning in}} their local ridings, and not talking to the national media", and that it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> that they hold daily news conferences with the party's most prominent members.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{generally}} well received by critics.

[...] James Hunter of Rolling Stone similarly praised the album for its [...] "finely worked-out chunks of serious gun-metal rockcraft that depend on the San Francisco band's restless, edgy electric guitars" [...] {{and concluded that the}} album was a rarity in the way it [...] "works best as either background rock or intimate headphone material." [...] Elysa Gardner of Entertainment Weekly noted Jenkins' lyrics and vocal delivery and Cadogan's guitar-work as standout elements of the album.|$|E

He had visited New York {{for the first time}} and remarked [...] "I looked into the streets – the glaring lights and the tall buildings – and there I conceived Metropolis." [...] Describing his first impressions of the city, Lang said that [...] "the buildings seemed to be a vertical sail, scintillating and very light, a luxurious backdrop, suspended in the dark sky to dazzle, distract and hypnotize".

2500|$|On {{the subject}} of suicide, Hauerwas {{challenges}} the claim that autonomous suicide is morally acceptable, but also wants to distinguish himself from the position that denies rational suicide. He believes that suicide can be and often is a rational decision of an “autonomous” agent, but does {{not agree with the}} notion that it is justified. He contends that suicide as an institution must be considered morally doubtful, as the life that we are given should be considered a gift bestowed upon us by God. To many, the term [...] "rational suicide" [...] {{is based on the assumption}} that the decision to live or die depends on whether life has a meaning or purpose. Hauerwas, however, contends that the reason we should live on, is because our lives are not ours, and as such, reminds us that there is a commitment to keep on living. Yet, while there may be times in our lives where suicide may seem rational, mere existence allows us to enjoy certain joys, such as helping another, or healing the sick, that <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to sustain our commitment to living.|$|E
2500|$|He {{rejected}} the respondents' position that [...] "an employer's good-faith belief that its actions {{are necessary to}} comply with Title VII's disparate-impact provision <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to justify race-conscious conduct." [...] This position would ignore [...] "the original, foundational prohibition of Title VII," [...] which bars employers from taking adverse action [...] "because of... race." [...] §2000e–2(a)(1); and when Congress codified the disparate-impact provision in 1991, it made no exception to disparate-treatment liability for actions taken in a good-faith effort {{to comply with the}} new, disparate-impact provision in subsection (k). Respondents' policy would encourage race-based action at the slightest hint of disparate impact— e.g. causing employers to discard the results of lawful and beneficial promotional examinations even where there is little if any evidence of disparate-impact discrimination— which would amount to a de facto quota system, in which a [...] "focus on statistics... could put undue pressure on employers to adopt inappropriate prophylactic measures." [...] "That operational principle could not be justified, for Title VII is express in disclaiming any interpretation of its requirements as calling for outright racial balancing." [...] §2000e–2(j).

2500|$|January Jones plays Emma Frost/White Queen in , {{released}} by Fox on June 3, 2011. She {{is a powerful}} telepath as well as possessing her diamond skin, and is the consort of Sebastian Shaw, the villainous leader of the Hellfire Club who seeks to start a nuclear war between the Soviet Union and United States. This would eradicate all non-mutant life and mutate any survivors, leaving the Hellfire Club to rule over this new world order. Charles Xavier, Erik Lehnsherr, and their team of teenage mutants thwart their plan, and Emma is incarcerated, though she is freed by Erik, who {{is now known as}} Magneto, {{at the end of the}} film. In this film, she is able to completely block Xavier from using his telepathy on her and Shaw, create illusions, perform mental torture, as well as sense the initial activation of Cerebro from thousands of miles away. While in diamond form, she shows absolute immunity towards psychic attack and has enhanced strength, durability, and reflexes, able to easily cut through glass and glacial ice, catch a throwing knife, and punch Magneto off a boat and into the sea. However, Erik uses his powers to choke her with a metal bar to get information out of her while in her diamond form.
