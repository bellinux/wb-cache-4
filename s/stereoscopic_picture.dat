The {{explanation}} is, of course, that in a great many thoughts there must be a few coincidences, and these instantly arrest our attention.

60|$|It {{was near}} the close of an October day that I began to be disagreeably {{conscious}} of the Sacramento Valley. I had been riding since sunrise, and my course through the depressing monotony of the long level landscape affected me more like a dull dyspeptic dream than a business journey, performed under that sincerest of natural phenomena--a California sky. The recurring stretches of brown and baked fields, the gaping fissures in the dusty trail, the hard outline of the distant hills, and the herds of slowly moving cattle, seemed like features of some glittering <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>picture</b> that never changed. Active exercise might have removed this feeling, but my horse by some subtle instinct had long since given up all ambitious effort, and had lapsed into a dogged trot.|$|E

Sometimes a Form has twists as well as bends, sometimes it is turned upside down, sometimes it plunges into an abyss of immeasurable depth, or it rises and disappears in the sky.

50|$|To {{present a}} <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>picture,</b> two images are {{projected}} superimposed onto the same screen through different polarizing filters. The viewer wears eyeglasses which also contain {{a pair of}} polarizing filters oriented differently (clockwise/counterclockwise with circular polarization or at 90 degree angles, usually 45 and 135 degrees, with linear polarization). As each filter passes only that light which is similarly polarized and blocks the light polarized differently, each eye sees a different image. This is used to produce a three-dimensional effect by projecting the same scene into both eyes, but depicted from slightly different perspectives. Additionally, since both lenses have the same color, people with one dominant eye (amblyopia), where one eye is used more, are {{able to see the}} 3D effect, previously negated by the separation of the two colors.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} telesurgery {{robotic system}} that the da Vinci {{was based on}} was developed at SRI International in Menlo Park with grant support from DARPA and NASA. Although the telesurgical robot was originally intended to facilitate remotely performed surgery in battlefield and other remote environments, {{it turned out to}} be more useful for minimally invasive on-site surgery. The patents for the early prototype were sold to Intuitive Surgical in Mountain View, California. The da Vinci senses the surgeon's hand movements and translates them electronically into scaled-down micro-movements to manipulate the tiny proprietary instruments. It also detects and filters out any tremors in the surgeon's hand movements, so that they are not duplicated robotically. The camera used in the system provides a true <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>picture</b> transmitted to a surgeon's console. Examples of using the da Vinci system include the first robotically assisted heart bypass (performed in Germany) in May 1998, and the first performed in the United States in September 1999; and the first all-robotic-assisted kidney transplant, performed in January 2009. The da Vinci Si was released in April 2009, and initially sold for $1.75 million.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} how {{the size of}} binocular disparity affects the impressions in different dimensions, as well as apparent depth, in viewing line-contoured stereograms, random dot stereogram, and <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>pictures</b> of naturalistic scenes. We used a semantic differential method with the scales {{that are related to}} the different dimensions of impression; evaluation, activity, and potency. The stereograms of naturalistic scenes were selected to give observers strong or weak impressions in different impression dimensions. We prepared the two-depth-layer condition and six-depth-layer condition for those stereograms. The size of binocular disparity between the nearest and farthest layers ranged from 0 to about 70 min of arc. Apparent depth magnitude increased with the increment of disparity size for those stereograms while the increment for the six depth-layer condition was larger than that for the two depth-layer conditions. Regardless of the type of stereograms, for the six depth-layer condition, the rating for the evaluation increased with the size of disparity although, for the two-depth-layer condition, it did not increase at the large disparity size. In addition, the rating for the activity increased with disparity size for both the two depth-layer condition and six depth-layer conditions if the stereogram induced some active impression by itself. These results indicate that the effects of binocular disparity size on apparent depth magnitude and impressions in viewing <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>pictures</b> depend upon the depth structure that is specified by binocular disparity, rather than what the stereogram representationally depicts...|$|R
40|$|The Midway, {{as shown}} in the {{provided}} 61 / 2 " x 6 " <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>picture,</b> first came to being during the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago as a bit of an accident. The world's fair scheduled for 1892 was pushed towards a higher standard than most others. The successes of the 1876 Philadelphia and 1889 Paris fairs drove the Chicago planners to produce something even greater. As stated by Richard Wilson, the Paris fair especially hit home for the Americans. The sheer magnificence of the buildings and exhibits made the United States look very backward indeed. While France {{and the rest of the}} Old World countries held their own with remarkable advances in art, architecture, and science, the U. S. appeared to be falling behind. America's relatively inferior showings didn't help to shake this harsh image. The U. S. was desperate for a new self-image. It needed an opportunity to establish itself as the superpower it felt it deserved to be. The Columbian Exposition gave the U. S. this chance. Fair organizers planned the fair on a grand scale.

50|$|To present <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>pictures,</b> {{two images}} are {{projected}} superimposed onto the same screen through polarizing filters or presented on a display with polarized filters.

This method {{is also known}} as being interlaced. The viewer wears low-cost eyeglasses which also contain a pair of opposite polarizing filters. As each filter only passes light which is similarly polarized and blocks the opposite polarized light, each eye only sees one of the images, and the effect is achieved.|$|R

40|$|<b>Stereoscopic</b> <b>{{pictures}}</b> {{are often}} said to appear clearer, i. e. less noisy, than flat {{pictures of the}} same technical quality. The authors argue that two factors {{may be involved in}} the subjective effect of visual noise interferences, namely the degree of correlation between the noise patterns of the left- and right-eye picture and the in-depth separation between a stereoscopically localized noise and the displayed objects. An exploratory study was conducted to test if a standard subjective assessment procedure would reveal any substantial effects of both factors. Results were that subjective impairment decreased significantly when correlation decreased, while the effect of in-depth separation was only marginal. Regarding TV applications, it is concluded that under specified conditions the signal-to-noise ratio of 3 D TV may be about 3 dB smaller than that of an iso-quality 2 D TV...|$|R
