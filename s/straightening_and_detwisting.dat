40|$|A {{new method}} of setting {{continuous}} bending <b>and</b> <b>straightening</b> strain rate according to temperature subzone was brought forward. By {{making use of}} the high temperature creep character effectively during the continuous casting slab being straightened, a new model curve of continuous caster was developed. And by using theoretical and finite element method the strain and strain rate of the slab under multi-point <b>straightening</b> <b>and</b> the new continuous straightening were analysed. The result shows that for continuous straightening the strain rate of the slab is constant and {{lower than that of}} the slab under multi-point <b>straightening,</b> <b>and</b> the strain varies linearly. It is verified that the new continuous straightening technology is reasonable and superior...|$|R
