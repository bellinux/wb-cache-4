[...] In January 2017 she wrote, [...] "When the Royal College of Surgeons protests at cancer operations cancelled, {{is that a}} tipping point? When {{nearly half of all}} hospitals declare major alerts for lack of beds, that’s an emergency. There’s no winter flu, no Arctic weather, just pressure from underfunding, like an aneurysm about to burst. But the prime minister is not for turning, not yet."

40|$|Abstract Given a graph, {{how to find}} a {{small group}} of ‘gateways’, that is a small subset of nodes that are crucial in {{connecting}} the source to the target? For instance, given a social network, who is the best person to introduce you to, <b>say,</b> <b>Chris</b> Ferguson, the poker champion? Or, given a network of people and skills, who is the best person to help you learn about, say, wavelets? We formally formulate this problem in two scenarios: Pair-Gateway and Group-Gateway. For each scenario, we show that it is sub-modular and thus it can be solved near-optimally. We further give fast, scalable algorithms to find such gateways.
