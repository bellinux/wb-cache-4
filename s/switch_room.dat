500|$|The British attack {{began at}} 4:00 pm. It was {{initiated}} with attacks on German gun positions by the Hellcats and Fireflies, which were flying five minutes {{ahead of the}} Barracudas and Corsairs. Tirpitzs protective smokescreen was not fully {{in place at the}} start of the raid, but by the time the Barracudas and Corsairs arrived she was completely covered by smoke. As a result, these aircraft had to blind bomb the ship, releasing their weapons from altitudes between [...] Only two bombs hit Tirpitz. The first was a [...] weapon dropped by a Hellcat that exploded on the roof of her [...] "Bruno" [...] main gun turret. The explosion destroyed the quadruple [...] anti-aircraft gun mount located on top of the turret, but did not cause any significant damage to the turret itself. The second bomb to strike the ship was a [...] armour-piercing weapon which penetrated through five decks, killed a sailor in a radio room and lodged near an electrical <b>switch</b> <b>room.</b> This bomb failed to explode, and German bomb disposal experts later determined that it had been only partially filled with explosives. The German report on the attack judged that if the bomb had gone off it would have caused [...] "immeasurable" [...] damage. British fighters also attacked other German ships and facilities in the Kaafjord area, damaging two patrol boats, a minesweeper and a radar station, as well as destroying an ammunition dump and three guns of an anti-aircraft battery. Tirpitzs last remaining Arado Ar 196 seaplane was attacked in Bukta harbour and damaged beyond repair. Four Corsairs and two Hellcats were shot down during the raid, and the battleship's crew suffered 8 fatalities and 18 men wounded. Casualties among the anti-aircraft units stationed around Kaafjord were heavy.|$|E

50|$|The railway network's {{backbone}} nowadays {{is formed}} by the 27-kV loop between the two power stations and the newly built Gösing substation {{as well as the}} transmission lines from there to the newly built Rabenstein substation.

This improved the power supply on the mountainous section of the line considerably. Nowadays, the <b>switch</b> <b>room</b> at Erlaufboden power station controls its own equipment and that at Wienerbruck power station.

50|$|The {{switches}} have {{an integrated}} time-domain reflectometer (TDR) built into every copper port, providing {{the ability to}} accomplish diagnostic monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities of the connected cables.

The tests can be accomplished on a single port or on multiple ports at the same time. The test can be accomplished through the command line or through one of several Graphical user interfaces called Device Manager (DM), Java Device Manager (JDM) or Enterprise Device Manager (EDM).|$|E

Another extension was added at this time at the rear of the post office section adjacent to the carriage-way.Following Federation in 1901, the colonial post and telegraph services were handed over to the Commonwealth Government and the Rockhampton Post Office became the Property of the Post Master General's Department.

At the other end, 110 connections may be used with keystone modules that are attached to wall plates. 110 blocks are preferred over 66 blocks in high-speed networks because they introduce less crosstalk and many are certified for use in Category 5, Category 6 and Category 6a wiring systems.|$|R
