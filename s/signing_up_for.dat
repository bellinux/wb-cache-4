5|$|At mid-season, Zürich {{newspaper}} Sport {{ranked the}} top 15 European players, and listed Cochet first (Borotra second, Brugnon ninth).

The two biggest contenders Cochet and Roderich Menzel met in the final, Cochet made a comeback from one set down to lift the trophy. He then toured Europe to give exhibitions in Cluj-Napoca, Budapest and Prague. Because of fever and a sore throat Cochet missed the French Championships. He did not recover from his illness before the second Italian International Championships but this did not prevent Cochet from <b>signing</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the competition. With titleholder Tilden having turned professional and Cochet's condition, the championships went easily to George Patrick Hughes. Cochet entered the finals of the doubles too, but his partner André Merlin couldn't make up for Cochet's bad shape and they lost to Alberto Del Bono and singles victor Hughes.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Goumri was 21st at the 2007 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, a strong overall team {{performance}} (including Anis Selmouni and Ahmed Baday) brought him his first team silver medal at the event. Goumri had a very successful return to the marathon (his first since 1997) at the 2007 London Marathon, finishing second in 2:07:44, just three seconds behind Martin Lel. He competed in his new speciality at the 2007 World Championships in Athletics, but did not manage to finish the race. Goumri looked to make amends for that performance by <b>signing</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the New York City Marathon. Just as in London, the race came down to a battle between Lel and the Moroccan, and history repeated itself as the Kenyan sprinted ahead to win while Goumri settled for second (recording a time of 2:09:16).|$|E

Initially named in a provisional squad of 30 for the 2009 World Twenty20, he couldn't find a place in the final 15, but in November of that year he fell one blow short of what would have been, at the time, just the second international Twenty20 century.
