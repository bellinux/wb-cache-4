25|$|A free <b>software</b> <b>implementation</b> (now abandoned) named Moonlight, {{developed}} by Novell {{in cooperation with}} Microsoft, was released to bring Silverlight versions 1 and 2 functionality to Linux, FreeBSD, and other open source platforms, although some Linux distributions did not include it, citing redistribution and patent concerns. However, in May 2012, Moonlight was abandoned because of its lack of popularity.|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} a {{decision}} points planning can be found through the thumbnail on the right. In this planning the decisions points are planned through time (top to bottom, left to right).

25|$|In 2011, {{the company}} {{launched}} a competition for New Zealand and Australian businesses, {{under the banner}} GAME ON. Companies were invited to put a compelling case for winning a Greentree <b>software</b> <b>implementation,</b> including cloud hosting. Winners of the inaugural competition were hospitality and accommodation provider Kimberley Group (Australia) business and bathroom furniture manufacturer Smail & Co (New Zealand). In 2012, GAME ON was run in the UK, and won by charity organisation Concern Universal.|$|E
25|$|Fixed-point {{representation}} uses integer hardware operations {{controlled by}} a <b>software</b> <b>implementation</b> of a specific convention about {{the location of the}} binary or decimal point, for example, 6 bits or digits from the right. The hardware to manipulate these representations is less costly than floating point, and {{it can be used to}} perform normal integer operations, too. Binary fixed point is usually used in special-purpose applications on embedded processors that can only do integer arithmetic, but decimal fixed point is common in commercial applications.|$|E

25|$|Many stream ciphers {{are based}} on linear-feedback shift {{registers}} (LFSRs), which, while efficient in hardware, are less so in software. The design of RC4 avoids the use of LFSRs and is ideal for <b>software</b> <b>implementation,</b> as it requires only byte manipulations. It uses 256 bytes of memory for the state array, S through S, k bytes of memory for the key, key through key, and integer variables, i, j, and K. Performing a modular reduction of some value modulo 256 {{can be done with}} a bitwise AND with 255 (which is equivalent to taking the low-order byte of the value in question).|$|E
25|$|A {{reference}} simulation <b>software</b> <b>implementation,</b> {{written in}} the C language and later known as ISO 11172-5, was developed (in 1991–1996) {{by the members of}} the ISO MPEG Audio committee in order to produce bit compliant MPEG Audio files (Layer 1, Layer 2, Layer 3). It was approved as a committee draft of ISO/IEC technical report in March 1994 and printed as document CD 11172-5 in April 1994. It was approved as a draft technical report (DTR/DIS) in November 1994, finalized in 1996 and published as international standard ISO/IEC TR 11172-5:1998 in 1998. The reference software in C language was later published as a freely available ISO standard. Working in non-real time on a number of operating systems, it was able to demonstrate the first real time hardware decoding (DSP based) of compressed audio. Some other real time implementation of MPEG Audio encoders and decoders were available for the purpose of digital broadcasting (radio DAB, television DVB) towards consumer receivers and set top boxes.|$|E

2500|$|Digital {{phase locked}} loops can be {{implemented}} in hardware, using integrated circuits such as a CMOS 4046. [...] However, with microcontrollers becoming faster, it may make sense to implement a phase locked loop in software for applications {{that do not require}} locking onto signals in the MHz range or faster, such as precisely controlling motor speeds. [...] <b>Software</b> <b>implementation</b> has several advantages including easy customization of the feedback loop including changing the multiplication or division ratio between the signal being tracked and the output oscillator. [...] Furthermore, a <b>software</b> <b>implementation</b> is useful to understand and experiment with. [...] As an example of a phase-locked loop implemented using a phase frequency detector is presented in MATLAB, as this type of phase detector is robust and easy to implement. [...] This example uses integer arithmetic rather than floating point, as such an example is likely more useful in practice.|$|E
2500|$|Relying on Mayo v. Prometheus, {{the court}} found that an {{abstract}} idea could not be patented just because it is implemented on a computer. In Alice, a <b>software</b> <b>implementation</b> of an escrow arrangement was not patent eligible because it is an implementation of an abstract idea. [...] Escrow is not a patentable invention, and merely using a computer system to manage escrow debts does not rise to the level needed for a patent. Under Alice, the [...] "Mayo framework" [...] should be used in all cases in which the Court has to decide whether a claim is patent-eligible.|$|E
