50|$|The {{introduction}} of the radioactive marker can either take place in vivo or in vitro.In the in vivo method, <b>stannous</b> (<b>tin)</b> ions are injected into the patient's bloodstream. A subsequent intravenous injection of the radioactive substance, technetium-99m-pertechnetate, labels the red blood cells in vivo. With an administered activity of about 800 MBq, the effective radiation dose is about 8 mSv to 12 mSv.In the in vitro method, some of the patient's blood is drawn and the stannous ions (in the form of stannous chloride) are injected into the drawn blood. The technetium is subsequently added to the mixture as in the in vivo method.In both cases, the stannous chloride reduces the technetium ion and prevents it from leaking out of the red blood cells during the procedure.The in vivo technique is more convenient {{for the majority of}} patients since it is less time-consuming and less costly and more than 80 percent of the injected radionuclide usually binds to red blood cells with this approach. Red blood cell binding of the radioactive tracer is generally more efficient with the in vitro labeling, and it is preferred in patients with indwelling intravenous catheters to decrease the adherence of Tc-99m to the catheter wall and increase the efficiency of blood pool labeling.|$|E
40|$|Float {{glass is}} widely used in {{architecture}} and in the automotive industry. During the float process tin diffuses into and reacts with the glass melt. The presence of tin in the glass surface region causes mismatch in thermoelastic properties between the bulk and the surface. This, in turn, can lead to wrinkling of the surface after the glass is subject to a toughening heat treatment. This project involves {{trying to understand the}} diffusion and reaction mechanisms that contribute to this phenomenon. A set of partial differential equations describing the important reaction-diffusion mechanisms has been proposed. This mathematical model is based on 3 redox reactions in the glass melt. 6 diffusing and reacting species have been considered, which comprise 3 redox couples, namely stannous and stannic tin, ferrous and ferric iron, and hydrogen atoms and ions. Using guessed parameters, the computer simulation shows the most striking feature of the tin depth profile - the tin hump, which is observed experimentally by Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) and Electron Probe Micro-Analysis (EPMA). It can be observed from the simulations that <b>stannous</b> <b>tin</b> diffusing into the glass is oxidised to stannic tin by ferric iron. The tin hump is due to the immobile stannic tin. The shape and location of the hump can be influenced by the float bath atmosphere and the oxidising species in the glass. These features are in agreement with experimental findings. The simulation also reveals that the tin hump forming process is a dynamic process. The Sn(IV) forms and converts back to Sn(II) simultaneously as the hump moves in the glass melt. However, an inverse method has not been found to recover the parameters of the mathematical model from SIMS data. This is due to SIMS's data being only qualitative, as well as the complexity of the model. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} theoretical {{study of the}} stability of the gas-phase diatomic dications SnF 2 +, SnCl 2 +, and SnO 2 + using ab initio computer calculations. The ground states of SnF 2 +, SnCl 2 +, and SnO 2 + are thermodynamically stable, respectively, with dissociation energies of 0. 45, 0. 30, and 0. 42 eV. Whereas SnF 2 + dissociates into Sn 2 + + F, the long range behaviour of the potential energy curves of SnCl 2 + and SnO 2 + is repulsive and wide barrier heights due to avoided crossing act as a kind of effective dissociation energy. Their equilibrium internuclear distances are 4. 855, 5. 201, and 4. 852 a(0), respectively. The double ionisation energies (T-e) to form SnF 2 +, SnCl 2 +, and SnO 2 + from their respective neutral parents are 25. 87, 23. 71, and 25. 97 eV. We combine our theoretical work with the experimental results of a search for these doubly positively charged diatomic molecules in the gas phase. SnO 2 + and SnF 2 + have been observed for prolonged oxygen (O- 16 (-)) ion beam sputtering of a tin metal foil and of tin (II) fluoride (SnF 2) powder, respectively, for ion flight times of about 10 (- 5) s through a magnetic-sector mass spectrometer. In addition, SnCl 2 + has been detected for O- 16 (-) ion surface bombardment of <b>stannous</b> (<b>tin</b> (II)) chloride (SnCl 2) powder. To our knowledge, SnF 2 + is a novel gas-phase molecule, whereas SnCl 2 + had been detected previously by electron-impact ionization mass spectrometry, and SnO 2 + had been observed before by spark source mass spectrometry as well as by atom probe mass spectrometry. We are not aware of any previous theoretical studies of these molecular systems. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

40|$|To obtain more insight in the {{ring-opening}} polymerization of lactones, complex {{formation of}} the initiators tetraphenyltin, <b>stannous</b> octoate, <b>tin</b> tetrachloride, aluminium bromide and triisobutylaluminium (TIBA), and the monomers L(−) -lactide, D,L-lactide and glycolide was studied by i. r. -spectroscopy. When equimolar benzene or toluene solutions of initiators and monomers were combined, only complexes of aluminium bromide and D,L-lactide or glycolide, and of TIBA and D,L-lactide or glycolide were observed. The complex formation was studied in detail by varying the initiator and monomer concentrations. From these results and theoretical considerations, it is concluded that complexes are formed by the coordination of a carbonyl oxygen of monomer and the aluminium atom of initiator. The corresponding polymers were formed when TIBA {{was used as an}} initiator. When AlBr, was used, polymers were obtained only when traces of water were added. It is concluded {{that in the case of}} AlBr 3 the actual initiating species is HBr and that the polymerization initiated with TIBA proceeds very probably through a coordinated insertion of the lactone monomer into the aluminium-carbon bond...|$|R

It has wide range of application from paint coating, anti-corrosion coating, space-shuttle material, construction (concrete), automotive, etc. Microcapsules containing reactive compound for use in self healing polymers are successfully fabricated via interfacial polymerization of polyurethane (PU). The possibility of glycerol as polyol monomer for polyurethane microcapsule shell in the preparation of PU prepolymer was studied. In this research, we also studied encapsulated self ealing agent using IPDI, <b>stannous</b> octoate, dibutyl <b>tin</b> dylaurate. FTIR analysis showed that obtained polyurethane prepolymer still haveunreacted isocyanate group necessary for interfacial polymerization of polyurethane. The morphology of polyurethane microcapsules containing IPDI was observed by scanning electron microscopy and shows spherical microcapsule with wrinkled surface but no gglomeration was found. The morphology of polyurethane microcapsules containing stannous octoate was also in spherical form but have a tendency of agglomerating and so were microcapsules containing dibutyl tin dilaurate. The average microcapsule size was 12. 33; 28. 59; and 25. 65 μm for microcapsule containing IPDI, stannous octoate, and dibutyltin dilaurate respectively. The smallest averageparticles size (12. 33 μm) was observed in microcapsules containing IPDI with narrow particle size distribution so the particles were more homogenous than the others...|$|R
