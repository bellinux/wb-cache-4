50|$|Dedicated console server {{appliances}} {{are available from}} a number of manufacturers in many configurations, with the number of serial ports ranging from one to 96. These Console Servers are primarily used for <b>secure</b> <b>remote</b> <b>access</b> to Unix Servers, Linux Servers, switches, routers, firewalls, and any other device on the network with a console port. The purpose is to allow network operations center (NOC) personnel to perform secure remote data center management and out-of-band management of IT assets from anywhere in the world. Products marketed as Console Servers usually have highly advanced security functionality to ensure that only qualified personnel can access various servers and that any data that is transmitted across the LAN, or over the Internet, is encrypted. Marketing a product as a console server is very application specific because it really refers to what the user wants to do—remotely control, monitor, diagnose and troubleshoot equipment over a network or the Internet.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the differences between SSL VPNs, IPSec VPNs, and other security technologies and explains why SSL VPNs are ultimately a better choice for <b>secure</b> <b>remote</b> <b>access.</b> At one time, a traditional Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) virtual private network (VPN) was the only option for <b>secure</b> <b>remote</b> <b>access.</b> However, because IPSec solutions were designed for site-to-site connectivity and not with a highly mobile workforce in mind, these solutions provided limited remote access and often proved both difficult and costly to maintain.

40|$|The biggest {{users of}} GRID {{technologies}} {{came from the}} science and technology communities. These consist of government, industry and academia (national and international). The NASA GRID is moving into a higher technology readiness level (TRL) today; and as a joint effort among these leaders within government, academia, and industry, the NASA GRID plans to extend availability to enable scientists and engineers across these geographical boundaries collaborate to solve important problems facing {{the world in the}} 21 st century. In order to enable NASA programs and missions to use IPG resources for program and mission design, the IPG capabilities needs to be accessible from inside the NASA center networks. However, because different NASA centers maintain different security domains, the GRID penetration across different firewalls is a concern for center security people. This is the reason why some IPG resources are been separated from the NASA center network. Also, because of the center network security and ITAR concerns, the NASA IPG resource owner may not have full control over who can access remotely from outside the NASA center. In order to obtain organizational approval for <b>secured</b> <b>remote</b> <b>access,</b> the IPG infrastructure needs to be adapted to work with the NASA business process. Improvements need to be made before the IPG can be used for NASA program and mission development. The Secured Advanced Federated Environment (SAFE) technology is designed to provide federated security across NASA center and NASA partner's security domains. Instead of one giant center firewall which can be difficult to modify for different GRID applications, the SAFE "micro security domain" provide large number of professionally managed "micro firewalls" that can allow NASA centers to accept <b>remote</b> IPG <b>access</b> without the worry of damaging other center resources. The SAFE policy-driven capability-based federated security mechanism can enable joint organizational and resource owner approved <b>remote</b> <b>access</b> from outside of NASA centers. A SAFE enabled IPG can enable IPG capabilities to be available to NASA mission design teams across different NASA center and partner company firewalls. This paper will first discuss some of the potential security issues for IPG to work across NASA center firewalls. We will then present the SAFE federated security model. Finally we will present the concept of the architecture of a SAFE enabled IPG and how it can benefit NASA mission development...|$|R
