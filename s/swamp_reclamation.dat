50|$|The {{study group}} wrote six treatises in the {{following}} year: four of them were published and quickly became regarded as masterpieces among that part of natural philosophy dedicated {{to the study of}} earthquakes, their reputation lasting through the following two centuries. The essays were essential in disproving emerging theories that blamed the earthquake on the drainage of the many Duchy's <b>swamps</b> and their <b>reclamation</b> as fertile agricultural lands. One of the leading theories at the time was that earthquakes were caused by subterranean winds, excited by change in temperature. The winds should have escaped through the marshes, but drainage compromised the process so the winds grew in pressure and caused shocks.|$|R
40|$|Mangroves {{perform a}} crucial role in {{maintaining}} the ecological integrity of the coastal ecosystem. They  act as filters in the coastal zone, preventing the damaging effects of upland sediments on seagrass beds and coral reefs, minimise the effects of storm surges and act as carbon sinks that mitigate climate change. These essential services, however, are degraded through indiscriminate cutting, conversion of mangrove <b>swamps</b> to fishponds, <b>reclamation</b> projects and other coastal developments and pollution. Experts reveal that the Indo-Malay Philippine Archipelago {{has one of the highest}} rates of mangroves loss. From an estimated 500, 000 hectares of mangrove cover in 1918, only 120, 000 hectares of mangroves remain in the Philippines today. The country has had the legal and policy framework to protect and conserve mangroves. But weak implementation of laws, overlapping functions among agencies and, in general, poor management by the people and local governments have hindered the sustainable management of mangrove forests. Positive developments, however, are taking place with the promulgation of laws on climate change and executive orders which specifically include mangrove and protected areas under the National Greening Program (NGP) and addresses equity, food security and poverty issues by giving preference to NGP beneficiary communities as a priority in the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) Program.   Moreover, participatory Planning and Multi-stakeholder Approaches are among the strategies contemplated by the Philippine National REDD + Strategy. The article examines the implementation and effects of the Philippine National REDD+ Strategy, the National Climate Change Action Plan which specifically integrates REDD+ and ecosystem valuation into decision-making, and the executive orders which support the mainstreaming of the National Greening Program...|$|R

50|$|William Thwaites (1853-1907) is {{considered}} the father of Melbourne's Sewage system, despite official design credits going to Mansergh. Thwaites commenced his engineering career on railway construction in the 1870s and then moved to the Victorian Public Works Department in 1879 surveying the Portland Harbour, Gippsland Lakes entrance and Sale navigation canal, as part of preparatory plans for their development under Sir John Coode's designs. He also undertook a survey of Swan Island for defence purposes in 1879. In 1880 he transferred to the Water Supply Department, surveying the Broken Creek improvement, and then under the renamed Melbourne Water Supply Branch of the PWD worked under mentorship of William Davidson. From 1881 he was surveying Bruce's Creek diversion and prepared drawings for the Yan Yean clearwater channel, Toorourrong Reservoir when he discovered Wallaby and Silver creeks and demonstrated their suitability for diversion of water to Yan Yean {{at a time of}} serious water storage. he then surveyed the Wallaby and Silver creek aqueducts. Thwaites also designed schemes of service reservoirs to serve the expanding suburbs, including those at Essendon Caulfield and Preston. However, a major failure in this period was the cracking of the new water main over Merri Creek on the Yan Yean supply, which was shown by W C Kernot to have been caused by errors in Thwaites' and Davidson's design. In 1883 Thwaites was appointed Engineer, Roads, Bridges and Drainage in the PWD, and undertook a series of <b>swamp</b> <b>reclamation</b> schemes including the Port Melbourne Lagoon (1885), West Melbourne Swamp, Moonee Ponds Creek, Koo-Wee-Rup Swamp (1890), the Moe River and Lake Condah although the last was completed by Carlo Catani.

40|$|Wetlands are a vital resource, {{particularly}} in Africa where livelihoods are {{closely linked to}} natural capital. In recent years, extensive drainage has occurred {{to make way for}} agriculture. To gain insight into whether drainage is justified, we review the value of African wetlands dominated by Cyperus papyrus in relation to use, conservation and conversion. Evidence suggests that the value derived from low-intensity, multifunctional wetland use far exceeds the value derived from <b>swamp</b> <b>reclamation</b> and generally exceeds that of conservation. At a local level, the main driver of wetland misuse appear to be a breakdown in collaborative management regimes and the main constraint on wetland use, the value of labor and sellingtimes. Local drivers are linked to regional factors such as the lack of coordinated wetland policies and difficulties in ensuring that legislation is absorbed by all sectors of society. We highlight opportunities for ensuring more effective collaborative management and legislation communication, which capitalize on existing governance structures. In contrast to predictions by Hardin’s Tragedy of the Commons model, we argue that effective wetland management is best achieved by preventing privatization and promoting common property management regimes. We also argue that poverty and income inequity are more important drivers of unsustainable resource use than environmental managers commonly acknowledge...|$|E
40|$|Some of {{the major}} effects {{of global climate change}} are rise in sea level and {{increased}} frequency of extreme events. Urban settlements in Nigeria are likely to be seriously affected by flooding {{as a result of this}} change. Urbanization processes in Nigeria increase pressure on land use conversion augmenting for population increase. The study observed that climate change frequently take place in flood prone areas such as flood plains and seacoasts. Floods expose the urban population and infrastructure to risk due to the excessive runoff which must be directed to rivers, streams, canals and storm water drainage systems. While a reliable urban infrastructure is vital for human needs, current urbanization trends in Nigeria are defining negative regards to flood vulnerability. Of particular concern is the fact the most impoverished segment of the population who are most likely to settle in flood hazard prone areas are the least able to adopt measures for adaptation in the event of flood disaster. Addressing these problems require effective environmental management agenda. Major causes of flood in Nigeria were identified to include uncontrolled expansion of impermeable surfaces due to physical development and expansion, <b>swamp</b> <b>reclamation</b> for construction purposes, lack of adequate storm water drainage systems, lack of maintenance of existing drainage systems and weak institutional capacity of urban administration and environmental management in Nigeria...|$|E
40|$|The peat <b>swamp</b> <b>reclamation</b> {{was done}} by {{drainage}} process that possible to get serious environmental impacts on peat land ecosystems. This drainage process often affects to the environmental degradation that increase carbon emissions. The key {{to the success of}} agricultural cultivation in peat lands is how farmers are able to control water table in the root zone. The depth of water table is ideal for food crops in zones of 20 - 30 cm below the soil surface. The study aims to determine the effect of water table control to the reduction of carbon emissions and to increase the potential for cropping intensity. The study was conducted in the Delta Berbak reclaimed tidal areas of Tanjung Jabung Timur Jambi Province Indonesia. Data collection was conducted from May to October 2012. Control of water table in tertiary block {{was done by}} tertiary gate operation. Results showed that water table was rise from an average of - 46. 53 cm to - 22. 7 cm below the soil surface. This means that the control of water table by the tertiary gate operations are able to make the land can be potentially cultivated of food crops and can reduce CO 2 emissions of 41. 7 tones / ha / year to 20. 5 tones CO 2 / ha / year that is able to reduce 50 % of the total emissions carbon.
