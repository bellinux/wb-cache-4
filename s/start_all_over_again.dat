If any member hurt himself during or after the execution of a movement, the movement was deemed a failure. A movement executed only once was not considered an achievement; only with repetition was the challenge complete.

If any mistake was made by any traceur in the group everyone had to <b>start</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
25|$|Several {{cars were}} {{conceived}} by Henry Ford from {{the founding of}} the company in 1903 before the Model T was introduced. Although he started with the Model A, there were not 19 production models (A through T); some were only prototypes. The production model immediately before the Model T was the Model S, an upgraded version of the company's largest success to that point, the Model N. The follow-up was the Ford Model A (rather than any Model U). The company publicity said this was because the new car was such a departure from the old that Henry wanted to <b>start</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> with the letter A.|$|E
25|$|Ruskin {{was born}} at 54 Hunter Street, Brunswick Square, London (demolished 1969), south of St Pancras railway station. His {{childhood}} was characterised by the contrasting influences {{of his father and}} mother, both fiercely ambitious for him. John James Ruskin helped to develop his son's Romanticism. They shared a passion for the works of Byron, Shakespeare and especially Walter Scott. They visited Scott's home, Abbotsford in 1838, but Ruskin was disappointed by its appearance. Margaret Ruskin, an Evangelical Christian, more cautious and restrained than her husband, taught young John to read the King James Bible from beginning to end, and then to <b>start</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>again,</b> committing large portions to memory. Its language, imagery and stories had a profound and lasting effect on his writing.|$|E

25|$|Alexander Maconochie, a Scottish {{geographer}} and {{captain in}} the Royal Navy, introduced the modern idea of parole when, in 1840, he was appointed superintendent of the British penal colonies in Norfolk Island, Australia. He developed a plan {{to prepare them for}} eventual return to society that involved three grades. The first two consisted of promotions earned through good behaviour, labour, and study. The third grade in the system involved conditional liberty outside of prison while obeying rules. A violation would return them to prison and they would <b>start</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> through the ranks of the three-grade process. He reformed its ticket of leave system, instituting what many consider the world's first parole system. Prisoners served indeterminate sentences from which they could be released early if they showed evidence of rehabilitation through participation in a graded classification system based on a unit of exchange called a mark. Prisoners earned marks through good behavior, lost them through bad behavior, and could spend them on passage to higher classification statuses ultimately conveying freedom.|$|E
500|$|After the {{recording}} sessions were completed, Nirvana sent unmastered tapes {{of the album}} to several individuals, including the president of DGC's parent company Geffen Records Ed Rosenblatt and the group's management company Gold Mountain. [...] When asked about the feedback he received, Cobain told Michael Azerrad, [...] "The grown-ups don't like it." [...] He said he was told his songwriting was [...] "not up to par", the sound was [...] "unlistenable", {{and that there was}} uncertainty that mainstream radio would welcome the sound of Albini's production. [...] There were few people at Geffen or Gold Mountain who wanted the band to record with Albini to begin with, and Cobain felt he was receiving an unstated message to scrap the sessions and <b>start</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>again.</b> [...] Cobain was upset and said to Azerrad, [...] "I should just re-record this record and do the same thing we did last year because we sold out last year—there's no reason to try and redeem ourselves as artists at this point. [...] I can't help myself—I'm just putting out a record I would like to listen to at home." [...] However, a number of the group's friends liked the album, and by April 1993, Nirvana was intent on releasing In Utero as it was. [...] According to Cobain, [...] "Of course, they want another Nevermind, but I'd rather die than do that. [...] This {{is exactly the kind of}} record I would buy as a fan, that I would enjoy owning." ...|$|E
500|$|Telegraph Avenue, {{adapted from}} {{an idea for}} a TV series pilot that Chabon was asked to write in 1999, is a social novel set on the borders between Oakland and Berkeley in the summer of 2004 that sees a [...] "large cast of {{characters}} grapple with infidelity, fatherhood, crooked politicians, racism, nostalgia and buried secrets." [...] Chabon said upon publication {{in an interview with the}} San Francisco Chronicle that the novel concerns [...] "the possibility and impossibility of creating shared community spaces that attempt to transcend the limits imposed on us by our backgrounds, heritage and history." [...] Five years in gestation, Telegraph Avenue had a difficult birth, Chabon telling the Guardian newspaper, [...] "I got two years into the novel and got completely stymied and felt like it was an utter flop.... I had to <b>start</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>again,</b> keeping the characters but reinventing the story completely and leaving behind almost every element." [...] After starting out with literary realism with his first two novels and moving into genre-fiction experiments from The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay onward, Chabon feels that Telegraph Avenue is a significant [...] "unification" [...] of his earlier and later styles, declaring in an interview, [...] "I could do whatever I wanted to do in this book and it would be OK even if it verged on crime fiction, even if it verged on magic realism, even if it verged on martial arts fiction.... I was open to all of that and yet I didn't have to repudiate or steer away from the naturalistic story about two families living their everyday lives and coping with pregnancy and birth and adultery and business failure and all the issues that might go into making a novel written in the genre of mainstream quote-unquote realistic fiction, that that was another genre for me now and I felt free to mix them all in a sense." [...] The novel has been optioned by film producer Scott Rudin (who previously optioned and produced Wonder Boys), and Cameron Crowe is adapting the novel into a screenplay, according to Chabon.|$|E

2500|$|When Perry and McKee {{first met}} in 2004, {{they both were}} [...] "really into Lolita" [...] and [...] "had a mutual fascination with the {{adolescent}} state of mind." [...] They explored the themes in their first records: Perry wrote One of the Boys, which touched on {{the early stages of}} discovering that boys could be more than friends, whereas McKee wrote [...] "Confessions of a Teenage Girl", which was about using sexual power to one's advantage. For the Teenage Dream sessions, Perry and McKee had a [...] "forever young" [...] idea in mind. Perry at first wrote a lyric about Peter Pan, but they later deemed it as [...] "too young" [...] since [...] "we wanted it to have more edge, more sex." [...] Another version included the lines [...] "And {{the next thing you know}} / You're a mom in a minivan", which made them laugh uncontrollably for an hour. There was a final version that was based around the metaphor of [...] "" [...] comparing clothes to sex, in a similar manner to Madonna's 1985 single [...] "Dress You Up". It was rejected by the producers, as McKee explained, [...] "Luke always makes us 'Benny Proof' everything. He says that if Benny doesn't get it, America won't get it." [...] Blanco showed them The Teenagers's 2007 single [...] "Homecoming" [...] and asked them to write in a similar style.

And that same idea which, when launched amidst the surroundings of the Boyne Club, had seemed so brilliant, now took on an aspect of tawdriness. Another thought intruded itself,--that of Mr. Pugh, the president of the Ribblevale Company. My father had known him, and some years before I had traveled halfway across the state in his company; his kindliness had impressed me. He had spent a large part of his business life, I knew, in building up the Ribblevale, and now it was to be wrested from him; he was to be set aside, perhaps forced to <b>start</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> when old age was coming on!
