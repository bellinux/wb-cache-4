40|$|Introduction Human <b>sweat</b> is {{a complex}} biofluid of {{interest}} to diverse scientific fields. Metabolomics analysis of <b>sweat</b> promises to improve screening, diagnosis and self-monitoring of numerous conditions through new applications and greater personalisation of medical interventions. Before these applications can be fully developed, existing methods for the collection, handling, processing and storage of human <b>sweat</b> need to be revised. This review presents a cross-disciplinary overview of the origins, composition, physical characteristics and functional roles of human <b>sweat,</b> and explores the factors involved in standardising <b>sweat</b> collection for metabolomics analysis. Methods A literature review of human <b>sweat</b> analysis over the past 10 years (2006 - 2016) was performed to identify studies with metabolomics or similarly applicable &# 039;omics&# 039; analysis. These studies were reviewed with attention to <b>sweat</b> induction and sampling techniques, timing of <b>sweat</b> collection, <b>sweat</b> storage conditions, laboratory derivation, processing and analytical platforms. Results Comparative analysis of 20 studies revealed numerous factors that can significantly impact the validity, reliability and reproducibility of <b>sweat</b> analysis including: anatomical site of <b>sweat</b> sampling, skin integrity and preparation; temperature and humidity at the <b>sweat</b> collection sites; timing and nature of <b>sweat</b> collection; metabolic quenching; transport and storage; qualitative and quantitative measurements of the skin microbiota at <b>sweat</b> collection sites; and individual variables such as diet, emotional state, metabolic conditions, pharmaceutical, recreational drug and supplement use.

5|$|Alterations in the {{autonomic}} {{nervous system}} can lead to orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing), oily skin and excessive <b>sweating,</b> urinary incontinence, and altered sexual function. Constipation and impaired stomach emptying (gastric dysmotility) can be severe enough to cause discomfort and even endanger health. Changes in perception may include an impaired sense of smell, disturbed vision, pain, and paresthesia (tingling and numbness). All of these symptoms can occur years before diagnosis of the disease.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Sweat</b> {{from the}} body is {{regulated}} by the surface tension of a <b>sweat</b> droplet at the pores and the pressure within the <b>sweat</b> duct. A <b>sweat</b> droplet grows in size until its surface tension and the pressure within the <b>sweat</b> duct are in equilibrium. When a hand is immersed in water, <b>sweat</b> droplets easily merge within the water, causing the pressure to drop at the pores. This in turn makes the <b>sweat</b> to flow freely into {{the water in the}} absence of counteracting pressure. <b>Sweat</b> glands produce more <b>sweat</b> because of the low pressure within the duct. To prevent loss of water {{from the body}} and to maintain the homeostasis, the body reacts by restricting the blood flow to the hand causing vasoconstriction and eventual wrinkling of the skin...|$|R

40|$|Females {{evaluate}} ambiguous {{facial expression}} – morphed between happy and fearful – faces as more fearful {{when exposed to}} fear <b>sweat</b> as compared to control odor (Zhou & Chen, 2009). We investigated the specificity of this effect, i. e. whether processing of fearful faces is affected specifically by fear <b>sweat.</b> In Study 1, we investigated {{the influence of the}} sensory properties of <b>sweat</b> in general, such that females may have a general tendency to disambiguate towards fearfulness in the context of any <b>sweat</b> odor. Thirty females evaluated ambiguous faces as either happy or fearful when exposed to fearful <b>sweat,</b> sports <b>sweat</b> or control pad. Using intensity evaluations of the <b>sweat</b> as covariates in the analysis, initially significant differences between fearful <b>sweat</b> and sport <b>sweat</b> in the facial evaluation task (p =. 029) remained significant (p =. 031). In Study 2 we investigated whether facial expressions are evaluated as fearful also in the context of <b>sweat</b> associated with another negatively valenced emotion: disgust. Twenty-four females performed the same task when exposed to fear <b>sweat,</b> disgust <b>sweat</b> or control pad. Significant differences emerged at one of the central morph levels, with the difference between fear and control significant at p =. 014, between fear and disgust at p =. 033, but ns between disgust and control pad. However, only the difference between fear and control remained after covariance-analysis leaving the difference between fear and disgust <b>sweat</b> insignificant.

40|$|<b>Sweat</b> {{secretion}} {{involves the}} transport of salt and water into the lumen of the secretory coil of the <b>sweat</b> gland. By analogy to salivary and submucosal glands, where fluid secretion is aquaporin- 5 (AQP 5) dependent, we postulated that aquaporin water channels might facilitate <b>sweat</b> secretion. Immunolocalization with specific antibodies revealed strong expression of AQP 5 at the luminal membrane of secretory epithelial cells in <b>sweat</b> glands in mouse paw skin. Novel quantitative methods were developed to compare <b>sweat</b> secretion in wild-type mice and mice lacking AQP 5. Total hindpaw <b>sweat</b> secretion was measured by proton nuclear magnetic resonance of sweat-derived 1 H 2 O in 2 H 2 O solvent, and <b>sweat</b> secretion from individual glands was measured by real-time video imaging of <b>sweat</b> droplet formation under oil. <b>Sweat</b> secretion rates after pilocarpine stimulation {{did not differ in}} wild-type mice (0. 21 ± 0. 03 nl min− 1 gland− 1) vs. mice lacking AQP 5 (0. 19 ± 0. 04 nl min− 1 gland− 1). The lack of effect of AQP 5 on <b>sweat</b> secretion rate was confirmed by microcapillary collections of <b>sweat</b> from defined regions of mouse paws. Also, as by direct counting of droplets, the number of functional <b>sweat</b> glands was not affected by AQP 5 deletion. <b>Sweat</b> gland morphology was similar in wild-type and AQP 5 null mice. From <b>sweat</b> coil geometry and gland secretion rate, the rate of fluid secretion was estimated to be 130 nl min− 1 cm− 2 of secretory epithelium, substantially lower than that of > 500 nl min− 1 cm− 2 in kidney proximal tubules and salivary glands, where active fluid absorption or secretion is aquaporin dependent. These results indicate the expression of AQP 5 in <b>sweat</b> gland secretory epithelium, but provide direct evidence against its physiological involvement in <b>sweat</b> fluid secretion in mice...|$|R
