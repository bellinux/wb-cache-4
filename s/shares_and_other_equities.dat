30|$|Concerning {{the equity}} layer, {{represented}} in Fig.  8, {{at the end}} of June 2017, the largest exposure exhibited by Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem via <b>shares</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>equity</b> was to Non-MMF Investment Funds, amounting to 0.61 trillion euros, followed by Rest of the World (0.49 trillion euros), Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem (0.32 trillion euros), and Non-Financial Corporations (0.24 trillion euros). More specifically, from the macro-network analysis of the financial exposures via <b>shares</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>equity,</b> we can notice that a very large part of the equity held by the private banking system is intra-financial (0.99 trillion euros), followed by equity issued by the Rest of the World 20 and the real sector (amounting to 0.49 and 0.24 trillion euros, respectively). This result could be interpreted as concerning for the following reason. The larger fraction of bank equity investments in the financial sector compared to the real sector seems to suggest the private banks’ preference for investments in financial services rather than in non-financial goods and services. This is consistent with the process of financialization, according to which, a large fraction of bank resources are addressed to finance (Allahrakha et al. 2015), that mostly funds the purchase of assets that already exist, rather than to businesses, that can employ them in financing new capital investments (Turner 2017).|$|R

Methods and Results It was applied a regressive model finalized to define the relation between the results of the estimation <b>and</b> <b>other</b> aggregates (employment, added value, income) calculated by the National Institute of Statistics and the above mentioned Tagliacarne Institute. The correlation was generally high and in most cases the statistical tests adopted have confirmed a close interdependence existing between provincial household wealth and respective economic variables. Conclusions Comparing theoretical data derived from the model with actual data, the discrepancies between North and South areas appear considerable. The northern provinces show actual values higher than theoretical ones (especially with regard to financial items), while the southern provinces, generally less developed, present a large proportion of real estate and, on the whole, actual values very low. The conclusion of the research is that it could be utilized for monitoring methods and results derived from the estimate. JEL: C 13, D 31, R 20...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we have {{conducted}} an empirical explorative analysis to study the implications of a specific case of unconventional policy, the ECB’s QE, {{in an attempt to}} investigate i) to what extent, the resources provided to the banking system through QE are transmitted to the real economy and ii) to what extent, the QE may alter the pattern of intra-financial interactions via loans and deposits, debt securities, <b>and</b> <b>shares</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>equity.</b> Our empirical results constitute a contribution to the debate on the effectiveness of unconventional policy tools, as they reveal three main findings. First, since the implementation of QE there has been a comprehensive increase in the private banking system interactions with the euro area economy, via loans and deposits, debt securities and equity. In particular, while both bank debt security and equity holdings have decreased, only bank lending activity has slightly increased. However, this increase is mainly due to the increased bank loans and deposits to the Eurosystem, rather than to the increased lending activity addressed to the real economy. Second, since QE, there has been an increase in bank exposures to the financial sector and a very slight increase in bank exposures to the real sector. Third, since the implementation of QE, there has been an increase both in Gross Domestic Product and inflation, as well as a decrease in the level of unemployment. In a nutshell, our research has brought to light some important facts with regard to the effects of Quantitative Easing in the euro area. However, as in most serious debates, the truth lies somewhere in the middle. More specifically, on the one hand, since QE, {{there has not been a}} significant increase in the interactions between the private banking system and the real economy and, in particular, the bank-firm lending level has decreased, while the banking system is increasing its interactions with the financial sector, <b>and,</b> on the <b>other</b> hand, the overall euro area economy is experiencing growth and addressing the risk of deflation.|$|R
30|$|Here, {{we address}} these two {{questions}} {{by taking a}} complex-network perspective to unconventional monetary policy. More specifically, building on (Perillo and Battiston 2017), we first extend the methodology to map the macro-network of financial exposures among the different institutional sectors operating in the euro area (i.e., Eurosystem, Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem, Other Financial Institutions, Investment Funds, Insurance Corporations and Pension Funds, Households, Non-Financial Corporations, and General Governments) {{and the rest of}} the world. In particular, differently from Perillo and Battiston (2017), we regard this macro-network as a multilayer weighted network in which the multiple layers correspond to different financial instruments. Second, we illustrate our approach on a novel hand-matched dataset, that we have built based on recently available data by extending our focus to i) loans and deposits, ii) private and public debt securities, iii) APP securities, <b>and</b> iv) <b>shares</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>equity.</b> Third, we investigate the financial linkages in the multilayer macro-network of financial exposures both from a static and a dynamic perspective in an attempt to capture i) the transmission of QE to the real economy through the increase of the interactions between the banking sector and the real sector, and ii) the level of intra-financial interconnectedness of the euro area, through the increase of the intra-financial interactions via loans and deposits, securities, and equity, since the implementation of QE. Finally, we extend the assessment of the macroeconomic effects of QE, by exploring the time evolution of i) private and public consumption, ii) private and public investment, iii) Gross Domestic Product (GDP), iv) Harmonised Unemployment Rate (HUR), and v) Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). The combination of network variables (i.e., financial linkages of the multilayer macro-network) and macroeconomic variables allows us to shed light on the implications of QE both in terms of stimulation of the real economy and intra-financial interconnectedness. This novel approach represents a tangible step ahead in the comprehensive analysis of the effects of unconventional monetary policy, which until now involved macroeconomic effects or financial markets’ impact, neglecting network effects and their interplay with macroeconomic variables.|$|R
40|$|Mutual funds {{generally}} do not invest in venture capital, private equity, or restricted shares of public companies. Consequently, individuals who desire to invest in such securities are {{unable to do so}} through diversified mutual funds. In this paper, we identify public policies and regulations that discourage mutual fund involvement in the markets for illiquid equity. We also present evidence that changes in SEC policy caused mutual funds to retreat from investing in illiquid equity. Under the Investment Company Act of l 940, the SEC requires mutual fund boards to determine and report the “fair value ” of their investments in restricted <b>shares</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> illiquid <b>equity</b> claims. The SEC interprets fair value to mean value in current sale. Under the Investment Company Act, fair value reporting is a “certification ” standard that presumes investors rely on the value representations of the fund board and its auditors. We consider whether alternatives to certification and current sale valuation could reduce barriers to mutual fund investment, without exposing individuals who invest in mutual funds to excessive risk or potential manipulation.

As we can see from Fig.  11, since QE, while bank lending activity(represented in red) has increased by the 5.83 %, bank financial exposures via debt securities (represented in blue) and equity (represented in yellow) to the euro area economy have decreased by 17.39 % and 6.26 %, respectively. Since the increase in bank lending activity was one of the intended intermediate objective of APP, we may interpret the increase in bank loans as a positive feedback of the implementation of Quantitative Easing. However, we wonder whether this increase is not too scarce against an injection of money into the banking system, that, at the end of June 2017, was equivalent to about 7 % of Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem total financial assets. Concerning debt securities, the decrease in bank security holdings, observed since QE, is not surprising, considering the massive purchases of private and public securities by the Eurosystem from the banking system. About the equity market, evidence on the Quantitative Easing implemented by the Fed suggests that the decrease in the returns of bonds, generated by the purchase programmes implemented in the US, made equity investments more attractive for investors, creating a great appeal for the equity market. [...] Despite the fact that our analysis does not allow us to observe the decline in the returns of bonds as a consequence of ECB’s QE, we can state that the decrease in euro area bank equity holdings seems to suggest that euro area Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem have not been subject to the aforementioned increased appeal for the equity market. As regards bank financial exposures via the analysed financial instruments broken down by counterparty sector, as shown in Figs.  12, 13 and 14, our estimate of growth rates of loans and deposits, debt securities, <b>and</b> <b>shares</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>equity</b> held by Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem and received/issued by the different institutional sectors operating in the euro area provide us with the following findings. With particular reference to loans and deposits, as we can see from Fig.  12, since the implementation of QE, on the one hand, loans and deposits granted byMonetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem to i)Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem, ii)Non-Financial Corporations, iii)General Governments, and iv)Other Financial Institutions and Non-MMF Invesment Funds have decreased by 9.07 %, 1.42 %, 5.22 %, and 6.81 %, respectively. On the other hand, Insurance Corporations and Pension Funds, Households, and theEurosystem have benefited from an increase in bank loans and deposits by by 3.17 %, 3.51 %, and 513.42 %, respectively. Consequently, the empirical evidence provided by our results on loans and deposits allows us to state that there has been an increase in bank lending activity, but mostly addressed to the Eurosystem. [...] Moreover, aggregated estimates on bank interactions with the financial sector and the real sector via loans and deposits provide us with empirical evidence on the increase of bank exposures to the financial sector by 14.71 %, and on the slight increase of bank exposures to the real economy by 1.28 %. Concerning debt securities, Fig.  13 suggests that, since the implementation of QE, only bank debt securities issued by Non-Financial Corporations have increased (by 14.84 %), while security holdings issued by all the other institutional sectors (i.e., General Governments, Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem, <b>Other</b> Financial Institutions, <b>and</b> Insurance Corporations and Pension Funds), have decreased (by 14.26 %, 28.63 %, 11.46 %, and 18.07 %, respectively). [...] Moreover, a comparison between intra-financial and financial-real exposures via securities suggests that, since QE, bank interactions with the financial sector decreased by 21.44 %, while bank interactions with the real sector increased by 14.84 %. Lastly, estimates on bank equity holdings by issuing counterparty sector, represented in Fig.  14, suggest that, on the one hand, bank financial exposures via equity to Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem <b>and</b> <b>Other</b> Financial Institutions have increased by 14.40 % and 72.90 %, respectively. On the <b>other</b> hand, bank <b>equity</b> holdings issued by Non-MMF Investment Funds, Non-Financial Corporations, and Insurance Corporations and Pension Funds have decreased by 1.11 %, 22.42 %, and 22.41 %, respectively. Further, with reference to bank-financial interactions versus bank-real interactions via equity, it is worth mentioning that, while bank exposures to the financial sector have increased by 1.03 %, bank exposures to the real sector have decreased by 22.42 %. All in all, the empirical evidence coming from our investigation of the time evolution of financial linkages in the multilayer macro-network of the euro area reveals two main findings. First, since QE, there has been a comprehensive increase in the extent of bank interactions via loans and deposits, debt securities and equity with the different institutional sectors operating in the euro area. In particular, while both bank debt security and equity holdings have decreased, only bank lending activity has slightly increased. However, this increase is mainly due to the increased bank loans and deposits to the Eurosystem, rather than to the increased lending activity addressed to the real economy. Second, since QE, there has been an increase in bank exposures to the financial sector(by 3.56 %) and a very slight increase in bank exposures to the real sector (by 0.55 %).|$|R
