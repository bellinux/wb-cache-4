40|$|Abstract: Proper {{lighting}} system, {{an important}} aspect of comfort conditions in a shelter (residence/work-place), includes use of artificial light sources (e. g. lamps) and natural illumination of interiors from daylight. Lighting design of buildings hardly receives due importance. Day lighting (through windows) is often main source of light during daytime. Artificial lighting, mostly by electric lights, forms significant part of worldwide energy consumption. Lighting design applied to a built environment, “Architectural Lighting Design”, is a science and an art. Comprehensive Lighting Design considers amount of functional light provided, energy consumed and aesthetic impact of lighting system. Tubular skylight, a simple device bringing sunlight to a building’s interiors at places, not receiving daylight, shows good potential of use for energy conservation and ergonomics. This paper presents results of experiments on performance of locally-fabricated Tubular Skylights of three different diameters, and comparison of illumination obtained with that obtained by bulbs of <b>standard</b> <b>ratings...</b>|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES Cognitive {{fluctuation}} (CF) is {{a common}} feature of dementia and a core diagnostic symptom for dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). CF remains difficult to accurately and reliably detect clinically. This study aimed to develop a psychometric test {{that could be used}} by clinicians to facilitate the identification of CF and improve the recognition and diagnosis of DLB and Parkinson disease, and to improve differential diagnosis of other dementias. METHODS We compiled a 17 -item psychometric test for identifying CF and applied this measure in a cross-sectional design. Participants were recruited from the North East of England, and assessments were made in individuals' homes. We recruited people with four subtypes of dementia and a healthy comparison group, and all subjects were administered this pilot scale together with other <b>standard</b> <b>ratings.</b> The psychometric properties of the scale were examined with exploratory factor analysis. We also examined the ability of individual items to identify CF to discriminate between dementia subtypes.

40|$|We set out {{to explore}} {{the meaning of the}} {{attachment}} categories in the Cassidy/Marvin strange situation procedure, as employed in the home, using data from a longitudinal study of children adopted into UK families up to the age of 42 months from Romanian institutions, and of adopted children without the experience of institutional care [...] both groups being assessed at 4 and 6 years of age. Inter-rater reliability was found to be good. Security (meaning the use of the parent as a secure base and no negative behavior on reunion) was the modal categorical rating in both the institution-reared and comparison groups, but the category of anomalous non-normative behavior (meaning a lack of any ordered attachment behavior as covered by the <b>standard</b> <b>ratings),</b> previously labeled 'insecure-other', was more common in the institution-reared children. Because this was unassociated with the usual manifestations of insecurity (such as avoidance or resistance) and because it was largely evident in interactions with the stranger, it is concluded that the adjective 'insecure' was not appropriate. Although this 'insecure-other' category was associated with disinhibited attachment as reported by parents (meaning a lack of differentiation among adults, a willingness to go off with strangers and a lack of checking back with parents in anxiety-provoking situations), it did not prove to be a good index of disinhibited attachment because changes over time in the 'insecure-other' category were not associated with changes in the rate of disinhibited attachment. Also, whereas the rate of 'insecure-other' fell markedly in the institution-reared group between 4 and 6 years of age, it rose in the comparison group, raising queries over its meaning...|$|E

40|$|Background: To preliminarily {{explore the}} {{spectrum}} of effectiveness and tolerability of the new antiepileptic drug topiramate in bipolar disorder, we evaluated the response of 56 bipolar outpatients in the Stanley Foundation Bipo-lar Outcome Network (SFBN) who had been treated with adjunctive topiramate in an open-label, naturalistic fashion. Methods: In this case series, response to topiramate was assessed every 2 weeks for the first 3 months according to <b>standard</b> <b>ratings</b> in the SFBN, and monthly thereafter while patients remained on topiramate. Patients ’ weights, body mass indices (BMIs), and side effects were also assessed. Results: Of the 54 patients who completed at least 2 weeks of open-label, add-on topiramate treatment, 30 had manic, mixed, or cycling symptoms, 11 had depressed symptoms, and 13 were relatively euthymic at the time topiramate was begun. Patients who had been initially treated for manic symptoms displayed significant reductions in stan-dard ratings scores after 4 weeks, after 10 weeks, and at the last evaluation. Those patients who were initially depressed or treated while euthymic showed no significant changes. Patients as a group displayed significant de-creases in weight and BMI from topiramate initiation to week 4, to week 10, and to the last evaluation. The most common adverse side effects were neurologic and gastrointestinal. Conclusions: These preliminary open observations of adjunctive topiramate treatment suggest {{that it may have}} antimanic or anticycling effects in some patients with bipolar disorder, and may be associated with appetite suppression and weight loss that is often viewed as beneficial by the patient and clinician. Controlled studies of topiramate’s acute and long-term efficacy and side effects in bipolar disorder appear warranted. Biol Psy...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMOTIVATION: Imaging mass {{spectrometry}} (IMS) is a maturating technique of molecular imaging. Confidence in the reproducible quality of IMS data {{is essential for}} its integration into routine use. However, the predominant method for assessing quality is visual examination, a time consuming, unstandardized and non-scalable approach. So far, the problem of assessing the quality has only been marginally addressed and existing measures do {{not account for the}} spatial information of IMS data. Importantly, no approach exists for unbiased evaluation of potential quality measures. RESULTS: We propose a novel approach for evaluating potential measures by creating a gold-standard set using collective expert judgements upon which we evaluated image-based measures. To produce a gold standard, we engaged 80 IMS experts, each to rate the relative quality between 52 pairs of ion images from MALDI-TOF IMS datasets of rat brain coronal sections. Experts' optional feedback on their expertise, the task and the survey showed that (i) they had diverse backgrounds and sufficient expertise, (ii) the task was properly understood, and (iii) the survey was comprehensible. A moderate inter-rater agreement was achieved with Krippendorff's alpha of 0. 5. A gold-standard set of 634 pairs of images with accompanying ratings was constructed and showed a high agreement of 0. 85. Eight families of potential measures with a range of parameters and statistical descriptors, giving 143 in total, were evaluated. Both signal-to-noise and spatial chaos-based measures performed highly with a correlation of 0. 7 to 0. 9 with the gold <b>standard</b> <b>ratings.</b> Moreover, we showed that a composite measure with the linear coefficients (trained on the gold standard with regularized least squares optimization and lasso) showed a strong linear correlation of 0. 94 and an accuracy of 0. 98 in predicting which image in a pair was of higher quality.

40|$|Standardized {{patients}} {{are widely used}} in training of medical students, both in teaching and assessment. They also frequently lead complete training sessions delivering physical examination skills {{without the aid of}} faculty teaching staff-acting as "patient instructors" (PIs). An important part of this training is their ability to provide detailed structured feedback to students which has a strong impact on their learning success. Yet, to date no study has assessed the quality of physical examination related feedback by PIs. Therefore, we conducted a randomized controlled study comparing feedback of PIs and faculty staff following a physical examination assessed by students and video assessors. 14 PIs and 14 different faculty staff physicians both delivered feedback to 40 medical students that had performed a physical examination on the respective PI while the physicians observed the performance. The physical examination was rated by two independent video assessors to provide an objective performance standard (gold standard). Feedback of PI and physicians was content analyzed by two different independent video assessors based on a provided checklist and compared to the performance standard. Feedback of PIs and physicians was also rated by medical students and video assessors using a questionnaire consisting of 12 items. There was no statistical significant difference concerning overall matching of physician or PI feedback with gold <b>standard</b> <b>ratings</b> by video assessment (p =. 219). There was also no statistical difference when focusing only on items that were classified as major key steps (p =. 802), mistakes or parts that were left out during physical examination (p =. 219) or mistakes in communication items (p =. 517). The feedback of physicians was significantly better rated than PI feedback both by students (p =. 043) as well as by video assessors (p =. 034). In summary, our study demonstrates that trained PIs are able to provide feedback of equal quantitative value to that of faculty staff physicians with regard to a physical examination performed on them. However, both the students and the video raters judged the quality of the feedback given by the physicians to be significantly better than that of the PIs...|$|E
