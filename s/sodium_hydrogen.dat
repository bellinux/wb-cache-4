25|$|Sodium {{bicarbonate}} (IUPAC name: <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> carbonate) is {{a chemical}} compound with the formula NaHCO3. It is a salt composed of sodium ions and bicarbonate ions. Sodium bicarbonate {{is a white}} solid that is crystalline but often appears as a fine powder. It has a slightly salty, alkaline taste resembling that of washing soda (sodium carbonate). The natural mineral form is nahcolite. It is {{a component of the}} mineral natron and is found dissolved in many mineral springs.|$|E
25|$|In a solid, {{only those}} {{particles}} {{that are at}} the surface can be involved in a reaction. Crushing a solid into smaller parts means that more particles are present at the surface, and the frequency of collisions between these and reactant particles increases, and so reaction occurs more rapidly. For example, Sherbet (powder) is a mixture of very fine powder of malic acid (a weak organic acid) and <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> carbonate. On contact with the saliva in the mouth, these chemicals quickly dissolve and react, releasing carbon dioxide and providing for the fizzy sensation. Also, fireworks manufacturers modify the surface area of solid reactants to control {{the rate at which the}} fuels in fireworks are oxidised, using this to create different effects. For example, finely divided aluminium confined in a shell explodes violently. If larger pieces of aluminium are used, the reaction is slower and sparks are seen as pieces of burning metal are ejected.|$|E
2500|$|The {{growth rate}} of E. coli and S. aureus {{was found to be}} {{independent}} of nutrient concentrations on non-antimicrobial surfaces. [...] It was also noted that antimicrobial agents such as Novaron AG 300 (Silver <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> zirconium phosphate) do not inhibit the {{growth rate of}} E. coli or S. aureus when nutrient concentrations are high, but do as they are decreased. [...] This result leads to the possible antimicrobial mechanism of limiting the cell's uptake, or use efficiency, of nutrients.|$|E

2500|$|Brand's process {{originally}} involved letting urine {{stand for}} days until it {{gave off a}} terrible smell. Then he boiled {{it down to a}} paste, heated this paste to a high temperature, and led the vapours through water, where he hoped they would condense to gold. Instead, he obtained a white, waxy substance that glowed in the dark. Brand had discovered phosphorus. We now know that Brand produced ammonium <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> phosphate, [...] While the quantities were essentially correct (it took about [...] of urine to make about 60g of phosphorus), it was unnecessary to allow the urine to rot. Later scientists discovered that fresh urine yielded the same amount of phosphorus.|$|E
2500|$|... {{anhydrous}} {{sodium carbonate}} {{also known as}} calcined soda is formed by heating the hydrates. It is also formed when <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> carbonate is heated (calcined) e.g. in the final step of the Solvay process. The decahydrate is formed from water solutions crystallizing in the temperature range -2.1 to +32.0 C, the heptahydrate in the narrow range 32.0 to 35.4 C and above this temperature the monohydrate forms. In dry air the decahydrate and heptahydrate will lose water forming causing the crystals to fall apart into a white monohydrate powder. Other hydrates have been reported, e.g. with 2.5 units of water per sodium carbonate unit ("pentahemihydrate").|$|E
