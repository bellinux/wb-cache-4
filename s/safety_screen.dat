40|$|Abstract. A novel {{method is}} {{described}} for uniform radio frequency (RF) heating of static or moving wires at atmospheric pressure, over long lengths, {{without the use}} of contacts or brushes. Conventional induction heating of wires is not possible because of the large annular coil gap and the RF skin effect if the wire diameter is comparable to the skin thickness. The method described involves placing a rod, of length equal to the heated zone required, parallel to the wire to be heated and about 2 cm from it, which allows the wire to be enclosed in a glass tube containing a protective atmosphere if required. The rod is connected to a 13. 56 MHz RF power source. Heated wire lengths tested ranged from 1 mm to 70 cm, and no indication was found of an upper limit of heated length. No special tuned length of wire is required and there is no upper limit to the temperature obtainable. The temperature along the wire can be either uniform or a temperature gradient can be set up by bending the RF rod closer to or further from the wire in a local region. A simple RF <b>safety</b> <b>screen</b> of 2 cm wire mesh size was found to prevent RF emission to the operator and environment. The method is of interest in wire processing and in chemical vapour deposition of coatings on wires, including insulating coatings, etc. The alterna-tive method of resistive heating with physical contacts may cause surface damage and sparking and does not allow optional controlled temperature gradients along the wire, nor heating at all if there is an insulating coating. ...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To compare daily {{sedation}} interruption plus protocolized sedation (DSI + PS) to protocolized sedation only (PS) in {{critically ill}} children. METHODS: In this multicenter randomized controlled trial in three pediatric intensive care {{units in the}} Netherlands, mechanically ventilated critically ill children with need for sedative drugs were included. They {{were randomly assigned to}} either DSI + PS or PS only. Children in both study arms received sedation adjusted on the basis of validated sedation scores. Provided a <b>safety</b> <b>screen</b> was passed, children in the DSI + PS group received daily blinded infusions of saline; children in the PS group received blinded infusions of the previous sedatives/analgesics. If a patient's sedation score indicated distress, the blinded infusions were discontinued, a bolus dose of midazolam was given and the 'open' infusions were resumed: DSI + PS at half of infusion rate, PS at previous infusion rate. The primary endpoint was the number of ventilator-free days at day 28. Data were analyzed by intention to treat. RESULTS: From October 2009 to August 2014, 129 children were randomly assigned to DSI + PS (n = 66) or PS (n = 63). The study was terminated prematurely due to slow recruitment rates. Median number of ventilator-free days did not differ: DSI + PS 24. 0 days (IQR 21. 6 - 25. 8) versus PS 24. 0 days (IQR 20. 6 - 26. 0); median difference 0. 02 days (95 % CI - 0. 91 to 1. 09), p = 0. 90. Median ICU and hospital length of stay were similar in both groups: DSI + PS 6. 9 days (IQR 5. 2 - 11. 0) versus PS 7. 4 days (IQR 5. 3 - 12. 8), p = 0. 47, and DSI + PS 13. 3 days (IQR 8. 6 - 26. 7) versus PS 15. 7 days (IQR 9. 3 - 33. 2), p = 0. 19, respectively. Mortality at 30 days was higher in the DSI + PS group than in the PS group (6 / 66 versus 0 / 63, p = 0. 03), though no causal relationship to the intervention could be established. Median cumulative midazolam dose did not differ: DSI + PS 14. 1 mg/kg (IQR 7. 6 - 22. 6) versus PS 17. 0 mg/kg (IQR 8. 2 - 39. 8), p = 0. 11.

40|$|Drug induced liver {{injury is}} a major problem for the {{pharmaceutical}} industry and health services. Yet 30 - 40 % of human hepatotoxins go undetected during in vitro studies. Hence, more predictive in vitro liver models are a critical requirement for preclinical screening of compounds demonstrating hepatotoxic liability. 3 D liver spheroids show promise as a novel model to investigate drug-{{induced liver injury}} with preliminary studies indicating the ability of spheroids to detect hepatotoxins as well as displaying an enhanced functional lifespan compared to 2 D monocultures. The aim of this thesis was to develop an improved in vitro model to investigate drug-induced liver injury. A viable C 3 A spheroid model with a lifespan of 32 days was successfully optimised. A characterisation of the spheroid model was performed, revealing direct cell-cell contacts, 3 D morphology and cellular polarisation, hence recapitulating corresponding features of human liver tissue. Subsequently, liver-specific functions were investigated in the C 3 A spheroids and were found to display zonation, functional transporters, CYP enzyme activity, albumin production, urea synthesis and functional mitochondria. After validating the biology of the model, the ability of the spheroids to detect hepatotoxins was examined. The C 3 A spheroid model correctly identified 66. 6 % of hepatotoxins to have a risk of liver injury, a higher predictive value than a 2 D model. As hepatocytes only represent 60 % of the cells in the liver it was predicted that including non-parenchymal cells in the C 3 A spheroid model would cause increased sensitivity to hepatotoxins. Indeed when C 3 A spheroids were co-cultured with endothelial cells or immune cells they correctly predicted more compounds to have a risk of human hepatotoxicity, improving their predictivity to 91. 6 % and 83. 3 % respectively. It has been established that novel biomarkers of liver injury HMGB 1, keratin 18 and miR- 122 have enhanced sensitivity when compared to current clinical diagnostic markers, however they have not been extensively analysed in vitro. It was determined that keratin 18 could be quantified from the C 3 A spheroid model and provides important mechanistic insight into the mechanism of cell injury occurring. Mitochondrial damage is implicated in up to 50 % of human hepatotoxins. It was hypothesised that by analysing mitochondrial function in more detail one could reveal the mechanism of action by which a compound might be causing toxicity. Mitochondrial dysfunction could be successfully analysed in the C 3 A spheroids, which were found to be more sensitive to mitochondrial toxins than 2 D cells. To conclude; C 3 A spheroids act as a human-relevant in vitro model with the potential to be incorporated into an initial drug <b>safety</b> <b>screen,</b> replacing 2 D models with poor sensitivity and specificity. Results suggest that the inclusion of non-parenchymal cells may be advantageous to liver models. Furthermore the analysis of endpoints including clinical biomarkers and mitochondrial function may improve the sensitivity of the drug screen...|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the concurrent validity of a brief suicide risk screener for {{adults in the}} emergency department (ED). Two versions of the verbally administered Patient <b>Safety</b> <b>Screener</b> (2 -item, 3 -item) were compared to a reference standard, the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSSI). Analyses included measures of agreement (Kappa). Agreement between the Patient Safety Screener- 2 and - 3 and the BSSI (n = 951) was almost perfect for overall positive screening (K = 0. 94 - 0. 95) and past suicide attempts (K = 0. 97 - 0. 98). Agreement on ideation ranged from fair (K = 0. 34) for the 2 item version to good (K = 0. 61) for the 3 item version. The Patient <b>Safety</b> <b>Screener</b> 2 Ì† 7 s concurrent validity with the BSSI ranged from fair to almost perfect and warrants additional study...|$|R
40|$|Three core samples, each {{having two}} segments, from Tank 241 -U- 201 (U- 201) were {{received}} by the 222 -S Laboratories. <b>Safety</b> <b>screening</b> analysis, such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and total alpha activity were conducted on Core 70, Segment 1 and 2 and on Core 73, Segment 1 and 2. Core 74, Segment 1 and 2 were taken to test rotary bit in push mode sampling. No analysis was requested on Core 74, Segment 1 and 2. Analytical results for the TGA analyses for Core 70, Segment 1, Upper half solid sample was less than the <b>safety</b> <b>screening</b> notification limit of 17 percent water. Notification was made on April 27, 1995. No exotherm was associated with this sample. Analytical results are presented in Tables 1 to 4, with the applicable notification limits shaded...|$|R
