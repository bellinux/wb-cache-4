5|$|Nicolls {{was born}} in Coleraine, Ireland, in a family with a {{military}} tradition, and raised there until entering school in Greenwich. In 1795, {{at the age of}} 15, he received his first commission in the Royal Marines, and began service with <b>shipborne</b> detachments of marines. During the Napoleonic Wars and associated conflicts in the Caribbean, Mediterranean, and North Sea, he served as a commander of ships' detachments, and gained his reputation for ferocity and courage.|$|E
5|$|The {{house sparrow}} {{originated}} in the Middle East and spread, along with agriculture, to most of Eurasia and parts of North Africa. Since the mid-19th century, it has reached most of the world, chiefly due to deliberate introductions, but also through natural and <b>shipborne</b> dispersal. Its introduced range encompasses most of North America, Central America, southern South America, southern Africa, part of West Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and islands throughout the world. It has greatly extended its range in northern Eurasia since the 1850s, and continues to do so, as was shown by the colonisations around 1990 of Iceland and Rishiri Island, Japan. The extent of its range makes it the most widely distributed wild bird on the planet.|$|E
5|$|After subduing {{the cities}} around the capital, Thomas {{resolved}} to attack Constantinople from three sides, perhaps hoping his assault would impress its inhabitants or lead to defections. His deputies Anastasius and Gregory Pterotos would attack the Theodosian land and sea walls, respectively, while he would lead the main attack against the less formidable defenses protecting Blachernae. All of Thomas's forces were amply supplied with siege engines and catapults, and his fleet fielded quantities of Greek fire in addition to large <b>shipborne</b> catapults. Each of Thomas's attacks failed: the defenders' artillery proved superior and kept Thomas's engines away from the land walls, while adverse winds hindered the fleet from taking any meaningful action. Deciding that operations {{in the midst of}} winter were hazardous and unlikely to succeed, Thomas suspended all further attacks until spring and withdrew his army to winter quarters.|$|E
5|$|Although the F-35B {{is fully}} capable of {{performing}} vertical landing, {{in a similar}} fashion to the way that the Harrier and Sea Harrier operated, this method of operation places limitations on the loads that the aircraft is capable of returning to the ship with. As a consequence, to avoid the costly disposal at sea of both fuel and munitions, the Royal Navy is developing the <b>Shipborne</b> rolling vertical landing (SRVL) technique for its operation of the Lightning II. SRVL is a hybrid landing technique that uses the Lightning's vectored thrust capability to slow its forward speed to around 70 knots to allow it to make a rolling landing, using its disc brakes, without the need of an arrestor wire. A special type of metallic 'thermal paint' is being developed to withstand temperatures of up to 1,500C in the vicinity of jet nozzles.|$|E
25|$|The first {{prototype}} <b>shipborne</b> {{radar system}} was {{installed on the}} USS Leary in April 1937.|$|E

25|$|The Ro.43s {{continued}} {{to take part}} in <b>shipborne</b> operations as late as June 1942, during the Italian cruiser attack on the Harpoon convoy. One of the Italian seaplanes was shot down by a Bristol Beaufighter from Malta {{in the course of this}} action.|$|E
25|$|The {{limitations}} of the Regulus I were well known {{by the time it}} entered service in 1955, so the Navy issued a specification for a surface-launched supersonic <b>shipborne</b> cruise missile, equipped to carry a nuclear warhead, that had greater range, accuracy and resistance to countermeasures.|$|E
25|$|During {{the night}} of 16/17 April, a mock diversionary landing was {{organized}} by CIA operatives near Bahía Honda, Pinar del Río Province. A flotilla containing equipment that broadcast sounds and other effects of a <b>shipborne</b> invasion landing provided the source of Cuban reports that briefly lured Fidel Castro away from the Bay of Pigs battlefront area.|$|E
25|$|A major ongoing {{project of}} the CBSA is Advance Commercial Information, which {{requires}} <b>shipborne</b> and airborne cargo entering Canada to be registered with the Agency. This assists officials at seaports and airports in their inspections, and allows for the tracking of suspicious materials. These phases of the project were implemented in 2005, with a similar highway and rail cargo program {{to follow in the}} near future.|$|E
25|$|Taihōs {{original}} design made no provisions for radar installation as the Imperial Japanese Navy did not possess any <b>shipborne</b> surface, fire control or air search radar at the war's outset in September 1939. Not until January 1941, when a Japanese naval technical mission arrived in Germany, did the IJN learn that European nations were using pulsed radar for combat purposes. In August that same year, the Navy Ministry initiated a crash plan {{to speed up}} radar development, resulting in (among others) the Type 21 and Type 13 air search radars.|$|E
25|$|In 1993 Campbell was {{transferred}} to the posts of Minister of National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs. Notable events during her tenure included dealing with the controversial issue of replacing <b>shipborne</b> helicopters for the navy and for search and rescue units. The actions by Canadian Airborne Regiment in the military scandal known as the Somalia Affair also first emerged while Campbell was minister. When the Liberal Party of Canada took power, the incident became the subject of a lengthy public inquiry, continuing to focus attention on Campbell and the PCs.|$|E
25|$|SRE-1 was {{traveling}} around the earth in a circular polar orbit {{at an altitude of}} 637 kilometers. In preparation for its reentry, SRE-1 was put into an elliptical orbit with a perigee of 485 kilometers and an apogee of 639 kilometers by issuing commands from the spacecraft control centre of ISTRAC at Bangalore on January 19, 2007. The critical de-boost operations were executed from SCC, Bangalore supported by a network of ground stations at Bangalore, Lucknow, Sriharikota, Mauritius, Biak in Indonesia, Saskatoon in Canada, Svalbard in Norway besides <b>shipborne</b> and airborne terminals.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Navy {{requirement}} (Specification HR.146) {{was for a}} Leonides Major-powered aircraft for a <b>shipborne</b> helicopter for anti-submarine, {{rescue and}} transport duties, Specification HR.149 was for a similar aircraft for the Royal Canadian Navy. The Royal Air Force issued specification H.150 for a general-purpose transport helicopter {{with the ability to}} lift bulky external loads. Bristol produced three designs, the Type 191 to meet the Royal Navy requirement, Type 192 for the Royal Air Force and the Type 193 to be built in Canada for the Royal Canadian Navy. In April 1956 orders were placed for 94 helicopters of all three types, prototypes with Leonides Major engines and production aircraft to use Napier Gazelle turboshafts.|$|E
25|$|Early in World War II, {{physicists}} in the United Kingdom {{invented the}} magnetron, a specialized microwave-generating electron tube that markedly improved {{the capability of}} radar to detect enemy aircraft. American companies were then sought by the US government to perfect and mass-produce the magnetron for ground-based, airborne, and <b>shipborne</b> radar systems, and, {{with support from the}} Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Radiation Laboratory (recently formed to investigate microwave radar), Raytheon received a contract to build the devices. Within a few months of being awarded the contract, Raytheon had already begun to mass manufacture magnetron tubes for use in radar sets and then complete radar systems. At war's end in 1945 the company was responsible for about 80 percent of all magnetrons manufactured. During the war Raytheon also pioneered the production of shipboard radar systems, particularly for submarine detection. Raytheon ranked 71st among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.|$|E
25|$|The phased {{withdrawal}} of the Gannet AEW, {{as part of the}} draw-down of fixed wing aviation in the Fleet Air Arm, led to a need for the Royal Air Force to take over the provision of Airborne Early Warning for the UK Air Defence Region. As an interim solution until a purpose built system could be procured, the radar and electronic systems from redundant Gannets were fitted to similarly redundant Avro Shackletons; the Shackleton was a maritime patrol aircraft then {{in the process of being}} replaced. However, this still meant that the Royal Navy, then in the process of introducing a new type of small aircraft carrier incapable of operating conventional fixed-wing aircraft, lacked an embedded AEW platform that could be used as part of the carrier task group. This lack of organic AEW capability following the {{withdrawal of}} the Gannet was seen as misguided, particularly following the experience of the Falklands War, in which the Royal Navy lost four ships due to the Task Force being reliant on <b>shipborne</b> air search. As a consequence, the Westland Sea King helicopter was modified to incorporate the Searchwater radar system for use in the AEW role from the Invincible class.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1937, she once more was reassigned to the east coast, as the {{flagship}} of the Training Detachment, United States Fleet. Late in 1938 or early in 1939, the warship became flagship of the newly organized Atlantic Squadron, built around BatDiv 5. Through both organizational assignments, her labors were directed primarily to training missions, Midshipman cruises, Naval Reserve drills, and training members of the Fleet Marine Force. Also in 1937, eight [...] AA guns in two quadruple mounts were added to improve the light AA armament. In December 1938, Texas received for testing the first <b>shipborne</b> radar designed and made by a commercial company, RCA, for the US Navy, the 385MHz CXZ. In 1941, Texas was one of fourteen ships to receive the RCA CXAM-1 radar.|$|E
500|$|Members of the Corps served {{alongside}} their <b>shipborne</b> Royal Marine counterparts {{from the}} Cockburn Chesapeake squadron (HM Ships Albion, Dragon, Loire, Jasseur and the schooner [...] ), {{participating in a}} series of raids. After the British failed to destroy the American Chesapeake Bay Flotilla at the Battle of St. Jerome Creek, they conducted coastal raids on the towns of Calverton, Huntingtown, Prince Frederick, Benedict and Lower Marlborough. On 15 June 1814, a force of 30 Colonial Marines accompanied 180 Royal Marines in 12 boats in a raid on Benedict. Nine days later, on 24 June, a force of 50 Colonial and 180 Royal Marines attacked an artillery battery at Chesconessex Creek (although this failed to prevent the escape of the Chesapeake Bay Flotilla, which left St. Leonard's Creek two days later).|$|E
500|$|Soon thereafter, Dahlgren {{inspected}} the battery, and was impressed. [...] The fortification, he wrote, was well situated and designed, laid out {{to defend against}} both <b>shipborne</b> bombardment and attack by landing parties. [...] Eleven guns bore on the channel: two [...] Columbiads, three banded rifled 32-pounders, four smoothbore 24-pounders, and two banded rifled 12-pounders. [...] A 6-pound smoothbore flanked the ditch. [...] The rear was defended by a [...] "formidable" [...] rampart and ditch, with a 24-pound smoothbore at either end; in the fort were numerous traverses and magazines. [...] The approach along the beach to the battery's right flank was covered by a 24-pound and a 12-pound smoothbore. [...] "If the works had been sufficiently manned", wrote Dahlgren, [...] "it would have required good troops to take the work." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2012, the RAF's Merlin HC3/3A fleet {{began to}} be {{transferred}} to the Royal Navy for use by the Commando Helicopter Force. [...] Royal Navy personnel worked alongside RAF crew at Benson to build experience during the transition. A £454m Merlin Life Sustainment Programme will see 25 HC3/3A airframes fitted with the cockpit electronics of the HM2, folding tails and main rotor heads, strengthened landing gear, deck lashing mounting points, obsolescence updates, fast-roping points and a common emergency egress system. The first HC4 is to begin flight trials in September 2017, with an IOC in mid-2018; an interim folding main rotor head will be fitted to some HC3 for <b>shipborne</b> operations prior to the HC4 upgrade. [...] Command of the UK Merlin HC3/3A fleet was formally transferred from the RAF to the Royal Navy during a ceremony at RAF Benson on 30 September 2014. [...] As part of the same ceremony, the RAF's 78 Sqn was disbanded and the Royal Navy's 846 Naval Air Squadron stood-up with the Merlin. [...] The RAF's 28(AC) continued to operate as part of the Commando Helicopter Force until July 2015, when 28(AC) Sqn stood down and 845 Naval Air Squadron stood-up. 846 NAS relocated from RAF Benson to RNAS Yeovilton in March 2015, with 845 NAS following in June 2016.|$|E

2500|$|The ship is {{the first}} Chinese ship [...] China {{originally}} imported a Ukrainian C-band active phased array radar for evaluation, but decided that the radar {{did not meet the}} Chinese requirement. Instead, China adopted a domestic S-band multifunction active phased array radar with four antenna arrays. The radar is developed by the Research Institute of Electronic Technology (also more commonly known as the 14th Institute) at Nanjing, Jiangsu province, and it is a successor to the 14th Institute's earlier developed Type H/LJG-346 SAPARS (<b>Shipborne</b> Active Phased Array Radar System) that was completed in 1998. However, under an earlier but completely different contract, Ukraine did provide cooling technologies for the antenna to China.|$|E
2500|$|In 1926 the Air Ministry {{specification}} N.21/6 {{was intended}} to produce a successor to the Fairey Flycatcher, then in its fourth year of Naval service. [...] By {{the time it was}} replaced by the Nimrod in 1932, the Flycatcher had become so obsolete in terms of its speed that RAF officers who flew it often joked that a sprightly fly might actually give the aircraft a run for its money. [...] None of the aircraft designed to this specification were selected for production after trials in 1928, but the radial-engined Hawker Hoopoe, not actually designed to N.21/26, was considered promising enough to be further developed. [...] Despite the Navy's traditional preference for radial engines, Hawker's designer Sydney Camm was convinced by his experience with the landplane Hawker Fury that the future for <b>shipborne</b> aircraft also lay with inline engines and began such a design, powered by a Rolls-Royce Kestrel. [...] Before it was completed Air Ministry specification 16/30 was written around it.

2500|$|Asheville, presumed lost, was {{stricken}} {{from the}} Navy list on 8 May 1942. Not until after World War II, however, did {{the story of}} her last battle emerge, when a survivor of the heavy cruiser , told of meeting, in prison camp, Fireman 1st Class Fred L. Brown. Hampered by engine troubles and sailing alone, Asheville was discovered on 3 March 1942 by a <b>shipborne</b> scout plane south of Java and overtaken by a Japanese surface force, lead by Vice Admiral Nobutake Kondō, consisting of the destroyers [...] and , and the heavy cruiser [...] As the cruiser stood by, the two Japanese destroyers closed and engaged Asheville at close range with their guns. After an intense 30-minute gun battle, the smoldering hulk of Asheville, her forecastle and bridge almost completely shot away, finally sank. Brown, an 18 years old from Ft. Wayne, Indiana, had been in the gunboat's fire room when the surface force had overtaken the ship. Many men topside were dead by the time Brown arrived topside to abandon ship. After calling to ask if there was an officer among the swimmers a sailor on board one of the enemy destroyers threw out a line, which Brown grasped and was hauled on board. Ashevilles only known survivor perished in the Japanese Makassar prisoner-of-war camp on 18 March 1945, in the Celebes Islands of the Netherlands East Indies.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1912, Africa {{took part}} in {{aircraft}} experiments at Sheerness. She was fitted for flying off aircraft with a [...] downward-sloping runway which was installed on her foredeck, running over her forward 12-inch (305-mm) turret from her forebridge to her bows and equipped with rails to guide the aircraft. Africas crew tested the strength and stability of the rails by {{jumping up and down}} on them, then held the Gnome-engined Short Improved S.27 pusher seaplane in place as Lieutenant Charles Samson entered its cockpit to attempt the first British shipboard aircraft take-off on 10 January 1912 while the ship was at anchor in the River Medway. The aircraft moved quickly down the runway, dipped slightly after leaving it, but then pulled up and climbed easily. Samson circled Africa several times to the cheers of the crew, although on one pass he came uncomfortably close to the ship. After a few minutes, Samson climbed to [...] and concluded his historic flight by landing safely at an airfield ashore. Africa transferred her flight equipment to her sister ship [...] in May 1912. Based on the 1912 flight experiments on Africa, Hibernia, and battleship , the Royal Navy concluded that shipboard aircraft were desirable for spotting and other fleet duties, but also that a fixed runway on a battleship interfered too much with the firing of the guns and that recovering seaplanes that had landed in a seaway was too difficult to be practical as a routine operation. But <b>shipborne</b> aviation had begun in the Royal Navy aboard Africa, and by 1917 would become an important part of British fleet operations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{primary role}} of the Akron-class was {{long-range}} reconnaissance, with their attainable height, long range and endurance enabling them to patrol far beyond visual range. The addition of the air group extended this capability even further, with {{the range of the}} aircraft allowing the airship to triple the size of its patrol area. However, there was disagreement over the best use of both the ship and her embarked air group. Initially, the Navy envisaged that the air group would be employed to provide fighter protection for the airship, with the ship itself undertaking the scouting, and thus proceeding right over the enemy. As a consequence, the primary aircraft carried was the Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawk, a small biplane fighter armed with a pair of [...]30in M1919 machine guns that was more suited to the air defence mission rather than reconnaissance. However, after several exercises in 1933 and 1934 showed that the ship itself was extremely vulnerable to attack both by aircraft and <b>shipborne</b> anti-aircraft fire, the Navy, over the objections of many officers such as Charles E. Rosendahl, who had commanded both Los Angeles and Akron, elected to alter the mission of the airship from direct scout, to genuine airborne aircraft carrier, with responsibility for command and control over its air group, leaving the reconnaissance to the air group itself. This tactical evolution began to be developed using Akron and, after she was lost, continued with Macon. A further development of the capability came when the Sparrowhawks were modified by removing their undercarriage and installing an additional external fuel tank, capable of carrying up to 30 gallons, thereby significantly increasing their range. The installation of the fuel tank, and RDF equipment, led to suggestions that the aircraft could scout an area up to 200 miles in any direction from the ship.|$|E
