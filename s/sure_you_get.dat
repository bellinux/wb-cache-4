500|$|Limp Bizkit {{will offer}} several concerts in UK during winter 2016 {{alongside}} Korn, {{two of the}} most prominent nu metal acts from 1990s. Regarding this nostalgic tour Fred says: [...] "You may have experienced a lot of cool concerts in your life, but I can guarantee you that an evening with Korn and Limp Bizkit will always and forever be your favourite. No one brings the party harder, heavier, and more exciting than us. No one. And… make <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> plenty of rest the night before. It’s time to bring it back!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Zissu was interrogated {{for some}} three years, and {{tortured}} {{at the hands}} of Securitate Lieutenant-Major Teodor Micle. He refused to sign any preordained confession, and made sure to write down and sign all his statements. Initially prosecuted for espionage, he was eventually found guilty of high treason ("conspiracy against the social order") and sentenced to life imprisonment on March 31, 1954. During the proceedings, Zissu lashed out at his co-defendant Benvenisti, who had caved in during the interrogation. As reported by Steinhardt, Zissu said: [...] "This court I shall not recognize, it has no authority over us. But when we'll be together in our own land, there I shall call you out and make <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> the punishment worthy of such cowardice." ...|$|E
2500|$|During a UFC 128 post-fight {{interview}} with Ariel Helwani, Evans {{stated that he}} was done training at Jackson's Martial Arts in preparation for his fight with Jon Jones. [...] He then commenced training at Imperial Athletics in Boca Raton, Florida, at a new camp co-founded by Evans and several Brazilian fighters who had concomitantly left American Top Team due to a dispute over management services; these were later joined by some African-American fighters, {{and as a result}} the camp's members became known colloquially as the [...] "Blackzilians," [...] especially on Twitter. Evans gave further insight to MMAWeekly about his leaving Jackson's Submission Fighting, “When you get to a certain point, you really need a lot of time (with the coaches)… make <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> the one-on-one, and you just need different things,” he explained. “After being at Jackson’s for a while, with so many people at the gym, it just got harder and harder for me to get that time." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "How I'm ever to get {{all these}} gowns into that trunk passes my comprehension. There's a tray for each, of course; but a ball dress is such a fractious thing. I could shake that Antoinette Roche for disappointing you at the last minute; and what you are {{to do for a}} maid, I don't know. You'll have so much {{dressing}} to do you will be quite worn out; and I want you to look your best on all occasions, for you will meet everybody. This collar won't wear well; Clara hasn't a particle of judgment, though her taste is sweet. These hose, now, are a good, firm article; I chose them myself. Do be <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> all your things from the wash. At those great hotels there's a deal of pilfering, and you are so careless." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Be <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> back in {{good time}} for tea," [...] said Mrs. Birkwall for a parting charge to her husband; and she bade Gaites, [...] "Remember that it is tea, please; not dinner;" [...] and he was tempted to kiss his hand to her with as much courtly gallantry as he could; for, {{standing}} under the transom of the slender-pillared portal to watch them away, she looked most distinctly descended from ancestors, and not merely {{the daughter of a}} father and mother, as most women do. Gaites said as much to Birkwall, and when they got home Birkwall repeated it to his wife, without injuring Gaites with her. If he saw what Birkwall had meant in marrying her, and settling down to his literary life with her in the atmosphere of such a quiet place as Burymouth, when he might have chosen money and unrest in New York, she on her side saw what her husband meant in liking the shrewd, able fellow who had such a vein of gay romance in his practicality, and such an intelligent and respectful sympathy with her tradition and environment.|$|E
60|$|Not so. Everything in {{the field}} of sight is equally puzzling, and can only be drawn rightly on the same {{difficult}} conditions. Try it fairly. Take the commonest, closest, most familiar thing, and strive to draw it verily as you see it. Be sure of this last fact, for otherwise you will find yourself continually drawing, not what you see, but what you know. The best practice to begin with is, sitting about three yards, from a bookcase (not your own, so that you may know none of the titles of the books), to try to draw the books accurately, with the titles on the backs, and patterns on the bindings, as you see them. You are not to stir from your place to look what they are, but to draw them simply as they appear, giving the perfect look of neat lettering; which, nevertheless, must be (as you find it on most of the books) absolutely illegible. Next try to draw a piece of patterned muslin or lace (of which you do not know the pattern), a little way off, and rather in the shade; and be <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> all the grace and look of the pattern without going a step nearer to see what it is. Then try to draw a bank of grass, with all its blades; or a bush, with all its leaves; and you will soon begin to understand under what a universal law of obscurity we live, and perceive that all distinct drawing must be bad drawing, and that nothing can be right, till it is unintelligible.|$|E
6000|$|A big, fat {{man who was}} {{standing}} in the middle of the kitchen with folded arms and a look of despair upon his round, greasy face, at once came toward them and asked eagerly, [...] "The blackbirds? are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> can <b>get</b> them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Indeed, I think <b>you</b> had; I'm <b>sure</b> mamma {{would break}} down there,' said Linda. 'Mamma, I'm <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> would never <b>get</b> over the {{official}} priggism.' ...|$|R

60|$|Again, let {{a certain}} {{part of your}} day (as little as you choose, but not to be broken in upon) be set apart for making strong and pretty dresses for the poor. Learn the sound qualities of all useful stuffs, and make {{everything}} of {{the best you can}} get, whatever its price. I have many reasons for desiring you to do this,--too many to be told just now,--trust me, and be <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> everything as good as can be: and if, in the villainous state of modern trade, you cannot get it good at any price, buy its raw material, and set some of the poor women about you to spin and weave, till you have got stuff that can be trusted: and then, every day, make some little piece of useful clothing, sewn with your own fingers as strongly as it can be stitched; and embroider it or otherwise beautify it moderately with fine needlework, such as a girl may be proud of having done. And accumulate these things by you until you hear of some honest persons in need of clothing, which may often too sorrowfully be; and, even though you should be deceived, and give them to the dishonest, and hear of their being at once taken to the pawnbroker's, never mind that, for the pawnbroker must sell them to some one who has need of them. That is no business of yours; what concerns you is only that when you see a half-naked child, you should have good and fresh clothes to give it, if its parents will let it be taught to wear them. If they will not, consider how they came to be of such a mind, which it will be wholesome for you beyond most subjects of inquiry to ascertain. And after you have gone on doing this a little while, you will begin to understand the meaning of at least one chapter of your Bible, Proverbs xxxi., without need of any laboured comment, sermon, or meditation.|$|E
