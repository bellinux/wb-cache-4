40|$|It {{is often}} assumed that brain tumor patients’ {{significant}} others (SOs: partners, {{other family members}} or close friends) may face greater stress than those of patients with malignancies not involving {{the central nervous system}} (CNS), due to progressive changes in neurological and cognitive functioning. We compared health-related quality of life (HRQOL) <b>of</b> <b>SOs</b> <b>of</b> patients with high-grade glioma (HGG) and low-grade glioma (LGG) with that <b>of</b> <b>SOs</b> <b>of</b> patients with non-CNS tumors with similar prognosis and at a similar phase in the disease trajectory (i. e. non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and low-grade hematological malignancies (NHL/CLL), respectively). HRQOL <b>of</b> <b>SOs</b> and patients was assessed using the Short Form- 36 (SF- 36) Health Survey. Patients’ neurological functioning was indexed and they underwent comprehensive neurocognitive testing. <b>SOs</b> <b>of</b> 213 LGG patients, 99 NHL/CLL patients, 55 HGG patients and 29 NSCLC patients participated. The <b>SOs</b> <b>of</b> LGG and NHL/CLL patients reported similar levels <b>of</b> HRQOL. <b>SOs</b> <b>of</b> HGG patients reported significantly lower mental health scores (MCS; p = 0. 041) and social functioning (p = 0. 028) than those of NSCLC patients.

Surprisingly, HGG patients’ cognitive and neurological functioning were not predictive of SOs’ mental health at the multivariate level. <b>SOs</b> <b>of</b> patients with highly malignant CNS tumors in the acute phase are at increased risk of compromised HRQOL compared to those of patients with systemic tumors without CNS involvement and a comparable life expectancy...|$|R

5|$|Mike Brown and {{his team}} favored the {{hypothesis}} that Sedna was lifted into its current orbit by a star from the Sun's birth cluster, arguing that Sedna's aphelion of about 1,000AU, which is relatively close compared to those of long-period comets, is not distant enough {{to be affected by}} passing stars at their current distances from the Sun. They propose that Sedna's orbit is best explained by the Sun having formed in an open cluster of several stars that gradually disassociated over time. That hypothesis has also been advanced by both Alessandro Morbidelli and Scott Jay Kenyon. Computer simulations by Julio A. Fernandez and Adrian Brunini suggest that multiple close passes by young stars in such a cluster would pull many objects into Sedna-like orbits. A study by Morbidelli and Levison suggested that the most likely explanation for Sedna's orbit was that it had been perturbed by a close (approximately 800AU) pass by another star in the first 100 million years or <b>so</b> <b>of</b> the Solar System's existence.|$|E
5|$|The Acropolis was {{the royal}} complex {{at the heart}} of Copán. It {{consists}} of two plazas that have been named the West Court and the East Court. They are both enclosed by elevated structures. Archaeologists have excavated extensive tunnels under the Acropolis, revealing how the royal complex {{at the heart of}} Copán developed over the centuries and uncovering several hieroglyphic texts that date back to the Early Classic and verify details of the early dynastic rulers of the city who were recorded on AltarQ hundreds of years later. The deepest of these tunnels have revealed that the first monumental structures underlying the Acropolis date archaeologically to the early 5thcentury AD, when K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' established the royal dynasty. These early buildings were built of stone and adobe and were themselves built upon earlier earth and cobble structures dating to the predynastic period. The two styles of building overlap somewhat, with some of the earthen structures being expanded during the first hundred years or <b>so</b> <b>of</b> the dynastic history of the city. The early dynastic masonry buildings of the Acropolis included several with the Early Classic apron-molding style of Tikal and one built in the talud-tablero style associated with Teotihuacan, although at the time the talud-tablero form was in use at both Tikal and Kaminaljuyu as well as in Central Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The US Navy Heliox {{saturation}} decompression rates {{require a}} partial pressure of oxygen {{to be maintained}} at between 0.44 and 0.48 atm when possible, but not to exceed 23% by volume, to restrict the risk of fire. For practicality the decompression is done in increments of 1fsw at a rate not exceeding 1fsw per minute, followed by a stop, with the average complying with the table ascent rate. Decompression is done for 16 hours in 24, with the remaining 8 hours split into two rest periods. A further adaptation generally made to the schedule is to stop at 4fsw for the time that is would theoretically take to complete the decompression at the specified rate, i.e. 80 minutes, and then complete the decompression to surface at 1fsw per minute. This is done to avoid the possibility of losing the door seal at a low pressure differential and losing the last hour or <b>so</b> <b>of</b> slow decompression.|$|E
40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} a heavy SO 2 pollution area located in north China plain (NCP). During the experiment, SO 2 and other air pollutants, liquid water content (LWC) of fog droplets, and basic meteorological parameters were measured. During the experiment, an intensive fog event occurred between 5 and 8 November 2009. During the fog period, the concentrations <b>of</b> <b>SO</b> 2 showed a strong variability, and the variability was closely correlated to the appearances of fogs and LWC. For example, the averaged concentration <b>of</b> <b>SO</b> 2 during the non-fog period was about 25 ppbv. By contrast, during the fog period, the concentration <b>of</b> <b>SO</b> 2 reduced to about 4 – 7 ppbv. The large reduction <b>of</b> <b>SO</b> 2 suggests that a majority <b>of</b> <b>SO</b> 2 (about 70 – 80 %) had been converted from gas-phase to aqueous-phase, showing a high solubility <b>of</b> <b>SO</b> 2. However, according {{to the value of}} Henry Law constant, the solubility <b>of</b> <b>SO</b> 2 is modest, which cannot explain the measured large reduction <b>of</b> <b>SO</b> 2. This study highlights that the aqueous reactions <b>of</b> <b>SO</b> 2 in the droplets of fogs play important roles to enhance the solubility <b>of</b> <b>SO</b> 2. To account for the effect of aqueous reactions on the solubility <b>of</b> <b>SO</b> 2, an "effective" Henry Law constant <b>of</b> <b>SO</b> 2 is proposed in this study. The study shows that without considering aqueous reactions <b>of</b> <b>SO</b> 2 in fog droplets, the estimate of the partitioning <b>of</b> <b>SO</b> 2 in droplets is significantly lower than the measured values. By contrast, when the "effective" Henry Law constant is applied in the calculation, the calculated SO 2 concentrations are significantly improved, showing that the aqueous reactions <b>of</b> <b>SO</b> 2 play important roles in controlling the solubility <b>of</b> <b>SO</b> 2, and should be considered in model calculations...|$|R

Paresthesia was the predominant symptom in less serious cases. Worse cases included ataxia (typically loss of balance), blindness or reduced vision, and death resulting from central nervous system failure. Anywhere between 20 and 40mg of mercury has been suggested as sufficient for paresthesia (between 0.5 and 0.8mg/kg of body weight). On average, individuals affected consumed 20kg or <b>so</b> <b>of</b> bread; the 73,000 tonnes provided would have been sufficient for over 3 million cases.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} his autocracy and iron rule, Cẩn earned praise from Huế-based US {{officials}} for his relatively high levels of success against the Việt Cộng insurgency. Cẩn's central region was much more peaceful than the restive areas near Saigon and the Mekong Delta. Cẩn created the Popular Force organisation to operate in central Vietnam. The Popular Force was {{an alternative to the}} Strategic Hamlet Program which was used on a much larger scale in the south by Nhu, who moved peasants into fortified camps in an attempt to isolate Vietcong cadres from accessing the rural populace and intimidating or otherwise gaining their support. Cẩn assumed a third or <b>so</b> <b>of</b> the rural peasantry were Việt Cộng sympathisers, significant enough to render the hamlets ineffective by intimidating other villagers from within. Cẩn's Popular Force were a group of volunteers who underwent rigorous training similar to United States Marine Corps Recruit Training. Those who passed the training were put into units of 150 men and assigned to live and work in the villages by day. At night, they did defense patrols, using hit-and-run tactics against the Việt Cộng. According to the report by US officials in central Vietnam, the program aroused popular support because of the integration of the Popular Force's personnel into the daily life of the village and the sense of security that the force provided. The units were generally regarded as being successful in their six-month deployments, allowing them to be deployed to the next trouble spot. Officials in Washington disagreed with the assessment of their subordinates in central Vietnam, alleging that Cẩn was mainly using the Popular Force for repressing dissidents.|$|E
