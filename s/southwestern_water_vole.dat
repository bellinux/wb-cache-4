50|$|The <b>southwestern</b> <b>water</b> <b>vole</b> or {{southern}} {{water vole}} (Arvicola sapidus) is a large amphibious vole found in most of France and south-westwards through Spain and Portugal. Although historically {{considered to be a}} member of the same species as the Eurasian water vole, Musser and Carleton (2005) considered it distinct enough to warrant full species status. It is listed on the IUCN Red List as vulnerable. It is threatened for many of the same reasons as the northern water vole, and a campaign is currently underway to seek protection for the species, both at a national level and at European Union level.|$|E
50|$|There are 28 {{species of}} trees. The lake's easily visible {{wildlife}} include birds, freshwater fish, reptiles, and mammals. Reptiles {{found in the}} park include the Iberian emerald lizard, the ocellated lizard, and Mediterranean pond turtles. Mammals that reached it were the <b>southwestern</b> <b>water</b> <b>voles</b> and weasels. Common and easily visible birds are mallards, Egyptian geese, great cormorants, domestic geese and swans, much of which bred in the park. Other common species include blackbirds, the moorhen, the coot, the black-winged stilt, the magpie, and several other species. Making it a spot for birdwatchers who photograph other species such as the squacco heron, the cattle egret, the hoopoe, the gadwall, the northern shoveler, the wryneck, and the tufted duck.|$|R
5000|$|... "Functional {{area of the}} Isère River {{downstream}} of Meylan" [...] - {{this area}} includes all territories of l'Ablenc that border the Isere. Despite water quality undermined by pollution from various industries located along the lower reaches of the Isere, this area has a very rich fauna and flora. This {{is due to the}} different ecosystems that can be found along the river, sometimes consisting of wetlands and also dry balmes. In terms of wildlife, the main mammals that can be seen are the <b>Southwestern</b> <b>water</b> <b>voles</b> and European beavers. As for birds: the family of herons is well represented with many other birds living in the area such as the European bee-eater, the Eurasian penduline tit, etc. In addition, the classification of this area as ZNIEFF type 2 is to better preserve the environment and is part of a broader plan to restore the water quality conducted by the Director of Planning and water management for the Rhône-Mediterranean-Corsica basin.|$|R
50|$|The trust {{carried out}} {{the first and second}} {{national}} <b>water</b> <b>vole</b> surveys in 1989-1990 and 1996-98. These surveys identified the crash in the <b>water</b> <b>vole</b> population in Britain. Following the publication of the first survey, the <b>water</b> <b>vole</b> was given a degree of legal protection in 1998 under the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act. In 2008, a greater level of protection was given in England and Wales. The long-term decline of the <b>water</b> <b>vole</b> resulted from a loss of habitat and changes in farming practices, but the acceleration in the rate of this decline in the 1980s was down to increasing predation by feral American mink. The status of the <b>water</b> <b>vole</b> is now monitored annually by the PTES through the National <b>Water</b> <b>Vole</b> Monitoring programme and is based on those sites originally surveyed by the trust.|$|R

Microtus richardsoni is also known as: Richardson's <b>Water</b> <b>Vole,</b> Richardson Vole, Richardson's Meadow Vole, Richardson Meadow Mouse, Water Rat, Big-footed Mouse, Giant <b>Water</b> <b>Vole,</b> and <b>Water</b> <b>Vole.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>water</b> <b>vole</b> is the UK's fastest declining mammal {{and efforts}} {{are under way}} to protect it and its habitat from further destruction. One aspect of <b>water</b> <b>vole</b> {{conservation}} in the UK is focused on non-linear habitats such as reed bed which support extensive networks or metapopulations. Other areas supporting healthy populations of <b>water</b> <b>voles</b> are large conurbations such as Birmingham and London and some upland areas where American mink are scarce.

50|$|<b>Water</b> <b>voles</b> - A nationally {{threatened}} species once common on rivers and streams. In Gloucestershire <b>water</b> <b>voles</b> have {{disappeared from the}} river systems and a few fragmented populations survive. The Trust provides information to identify a <b>water</b> <b>vole</b> and the land management necessary to support habitat. The <b>water</b> <b>vole</b> is on the list for action in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. The Trust carried out a survey in 1978/79 on rivers and streams in the county. A further survey was started in March 1997 {{in conjunction with the}} Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust. The Trust published the results of the 1997/98 survey in 2001.

40|$|In the U. K. {{the impact}} of {{introduced}} American mink Mustela vison, on <b>water</b> <b>voles</b> Arvicola terrestris, may be exacerbated by habitat loss and fragmentation. Pristine wetlands in Belarus, which American mink invaded in the early 1990 s, provide a three-pronged opportunity to test this hypothesis. First, we examine the evidence that, even in the unmanaged wetlands of our Belarussian study site, American mink have reduced <b>water</b> <b>vole</b> populations. Second, we ask whether habitat size, type and isolation mitigate {{the impact of}} American mink predation. Thirdly, we explore whether <b>water</b> <b>voles</b> {{are at greater risk}} of predation from American than European mink because of their patterns of habitat use. Following the invasion of American mink, <b>water</b> <b>voles</b> were most abundant in small, still-water sites, far from river banks, while American mink were most active in large, running-water sites. Small mammal remains were found in a higher percentage of American than European mink scats, and of these, more were <b>water</b> <b>vole</b> in American mink scats. The occurrence of <b>water</b> <b>voles</b> in scats of both mink species declined after the American mink invaded and established. Our results provide at least circumstantial evidence that American mink limit <b>water</b> <b>vole</b> populations even in unmanaged wetland eco-systems, and that they have a greater impact than their European congener at least partly because they make greater use of isolated marshes, Although by no means providing complete protection, the configuration and dispersion of available habitat mitigated the impact of American mink on <b>water</b> <b>voles.</b> This raises the possibility that habitat restoration, especially through the establishment of isolated enclaves, could help reduce the effect of American mink in the U. K. These observations are of broader interest in the context of assessing the effect of multiple pressures on vulnerable species...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Water</b> <b>voles</b> mainly eat {{grass and}} other {{vegetation}} near the water, {{but will also}} consume fruits, bulbs, twigs, buds, and roots when given the opportunity. In Europe, rich harvest periods can cause <b>water</b> <b>vole</b> [...] "plagues" [...] to take place, during which the voles eat ravenously, destroying entire fields of grass and leaving the fields full of burrows. <b>Water</b> <b>voles</b> {{in some parts of}} England have been shown to occasionally prey on frogs and tadpoles; it has been speculated that this is to make up for a protein deficiency in the voles' diet.|$|R
40|$|The {{population}} of <b>water</b> <b>voles</b> Arvicola amphibius was surveyed on 21 {{islands in the}} Solvær archipelago, northern Norway, in August 2012; 11 islands with semi-wild domestic sheep Ovis aries and 10 islands without sheep. Signs from <b>water</b> <b>voles</b> are very easy to detect and were used {{as a measure of}} the population (on a scale 0 - 10), and the numbers of sheep were counted. The ranking of signs on islands with and without sheep was compared, and a significant difference was found. Islands with sheep had, with one exception, only very small and fragmented populations of <b>water</b> <b>voles,</b> the one exception being a fairly large Carex swamp that was not grazed by the sheep and where a moderate-sized {{population of}} voles was found. Islands without sheep had much larger populations of <b>water</b> <b>voles,</b> giving a ranking about four times higher.

50|$|There {{have been}} several studies done on the habitat of the vole, given its very {{specific}} requirements, {{to find out if}} grazing or precipitation levels affect the vole populations so that we can protect them. It has been found that higher precipitation levels create increased availability of usable habitat for <b>water</b> <b>voles.</b> In years of that are wetter than usual it has been observed that young <b>water</b> <b>voles</b> become reproductively active sooner, and therefore can have more offspring. The mean number of pups in each litter increased as well. It has also been found that grazing affects the <b>water</b> <b>vole</b> populations as well. In areas of light or moderate grazing not as many young survived, and the population sizes tended to be much smaller than other colonies. Where there was severe grazing it affected the stream bank to an extent that it was no longer a suitable habitat. The presence of livestock presents numerous detrimental changes to the <b>water</b> <b>vole’s</b> habitat: altered abiotic characteristics, compacted soil, increased runoff, fractured stream banks, erosion, as well as loss of vegetation as protective cover and a food source. The abundance of ferns, mosses and shrubs are imperative as ground cover to protect <b>water</b> <b>voles</b> from predation, and in areas of grazing these plants were scarce or non-existent, and therefore <b>water</b> <b>voles</b> weren't often found in these areas.|$|R
