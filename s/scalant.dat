40|$|We {{demonstrated}} forward osmosis (FO) membrane integrity loss during gypsum scaling {{with the}} presence of membrane spacer. The gypsum <b>scalant</b> had preferential accumulation adjacent to membrane spacer where the needle-shape gypsum potentially compromised polyamide thin-film composite FO membrane integrity. However, the loss of FO membrane integrity cannot be sensitively detected by in situ measurements of membrane water and salt (NaCl) permeability coefficients. We, for the first time, employed membrane integrity challenge tests to reveal the impaired FO membrane integrity by fluorescent Rhodamine WT tracer and amine-modified latex nanoparticles, respectively. Challenge tests using Rhodamine WT tracer showed that membrane log removal value decreased to 3. 5 after three scaling–cleaning cycles, which corresponded to a pinhole size of 0. 06 μm 2 on the FO membrane. This result was further corroborated by challenge test using latex nanoparticle where the particle size distribution in the permeate became wider and the average particle size increased over the three scaling–cleaning cycles. Both challenge tests were sensitive enough to identify impaired FO membrane integrity. Results reported here have significant implications for achieving better membrane spacer and module design, as well as demanding periodical monitoring of FO membrane integrity in water reuse...|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} for predicting scaling in membrane distillation (MD), which considers thermodynamics, kinetics, and fluid mechanics, is developed and experimentally validated with calcium sulfate. The theory predicts {{the incidence of}} scaling {{as a function of}} temperature, concentration, and flow conditions by comparing the nucleation induction time to the residence time and applying an experimental correction factor. The relevant residence time is identified by considering a volume of solution near the membrane surface that contains enough ions to form a nucleus of critical size. The theory is validated with fouling experiments using calcium sulfate as a model <b>scalant</b> over a range of temperatures (40 – 70 °C), saturation indices, and flow rates. Although the model is validated with a bench-scale MD system, it is hoped to be compatible with large-scale systems that may have significant changes in concentration, temperature, and flow rate along the flow direction. At lower temperatures, the saturation index can be as high as 0. 4 – 0. 5 without scaling, but the safe concentration limit decreases with increasing temperature. Increasing the feed flow rate reduces concentration polarization and fluid residence time, both of which decrease the likelihood of fouling. The model is translated into easily readable maps outlining safe operating regimes for MD. The theory and maps can be used to choose safe operating conditions in MD over a wide range of conditions and system geometries. National Science Foundation (U. S.) (1122374...|$|E
40|$|We have studied, for {{the first}} time, the fouling {{behavior}} of pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) hollow fiber membranes under low, moderate and high hydraulic pressures. The thin film composite (TFC) polyethersulfone (PES) membrane has a high water permeability and good mechanical strength. Membrane fouling by gypsum (CaSO 4 · 2 H 2 O) <b>scalants,</b> sodium alginate, and the combined foulants was examined under various pressures up to an ultrahigh hydraulic pressure of 18 bar. In the combined fouling experiments, the membranes were conditioned by one of foulants followed by the other. Flux decline results suggested that such conditioning could increase the rate of combined fouling because {{of the change in}} membrane surface chemistry. Specially, the co-existence of gypsum crystals and alginate under 0 bar led to the synergistic combined fouling and resulted in a greater flux decline than the sum of individual fouling. Interestingly, such gypsum-alginate synergistic fouling was not observed under high pressure PRO tests because the increased reverse salt flux inhibited the formation of gypsum crystals. Therefore, alginate fouling could be the dominant fouling mechanism for both (1) alginate conditioning and then <b>scalants</b> fouling, and (2) <b>scalants</b> conditioning and then alginate fouling PRO processes under 8 bar and 18 bar. Since the reverse salt flux increases from 5. 6 ± 1. 1 g/m 2 h at 0 bar to 74. 3 ± 9. 7 g/m 2 h at 8 bar, and finally to 150. 5 ± 2. 5 g/m 2 h under 18 bar, the reverse salt ions lead to substantial declines of normalized flux under 8 bar and 18 bar because the reverse sodium ions not only reduce the effective driving force across the PRO membrane but also induce a significant cake-enhanced sodium concentration polarization layer and facilitate alginate gelation near the membrane surface. Therefore, the removal of alginate type foulants from the feed water stream may become essential for the success of PRO processes under high pressures...|$|R

Four water samples are presented, and for a representative case, the supersaturation of some likely <b>scalants</b> is estimated as a function of temperature, recovery ratio, and pH. This supersaturation map is then compared to conditions representative of common desalination systems, allowing the identification of limitations imposed by the water's composition. In contrast to many natural waters, it is found that sodium chloride is the most likely first solid to form at high recovery ratios, and that the top temperature of thermal desalination systems is unlikely to be scale-limited in the treatment of these waters.

The optimized operating condition obtained at pH 11. 1, and a ratio of [CO 32 -]:[Ca 2 +] = 1. 2 : 1 enabled to obtain 90 % efficiency of calcium removal from real water. The efficiency of scaling potential removal was validated by comparing the scaling level on the membrane surface of two electrodialysis batches of a washing water, with and without pretreatment. For the latter, <b>scalants</b> were found at both sides of the cation exchange membrane (FKB), diluate and base sides, identified as calcium and magnesium precipitates. Furthermore, there was also a severe scaling effect at the base side of the bipolar membrane (FBM). However, a different observation was found for the pretreated water.

40|$|High liquid entry {{pressure}} (LEP) {{is one of}} {{the desired}} characteristics of a membrane distillation (MD) membrane. Maintaining LEP above operating feed pressure conditions is critical to prevent permeate quality worsening by saline feed liquid passage through the membrane. Air gap membrane distillation experiments under controlled salinity and temperature operating conditions indicate that in addition to flux decline, inorganic scaling can also lead to feed breakthrough and permeate salinity increase in some cases. The relationship between calcium sulfate and carbonate scaling and breakthrough was further illustrated by comparing the permeate quality obtained using clean and fouled membrane with seawater brine of S = 120 g/kg as feed at t = 70 °C. While contact angle changes and pore size variation have been considered to explain salt passage and LEP decrease, the effect of surface tension of the feed liquid under MD operating conditions has not been investigated. In a previous work, the authors measured reference data and created correlations for surface tension of seawater for 1 ≤ t ≤ 92 °C and salinities 0 ≤ S ≤ 131 g/kg. In the present study, new measurements investigating the effect of scaling on the surface tension of seawater are presented. Bulk precipitation was observed in seawater solutions for t > 50 °C. Membrane distillation operating conditions were simulated in the surface tension measurements where the test-beaker was reused between experiments after rinsing, which left behind a thin layer of <b>scalant</b> on the glass surface. Repeatable results under these conditions show marked decrease in surface tension (up to 30 % at S = 120 g/kg) from standard correlations. This reduction in surface tension can cause LEP to reduce and increase salt passage in MD systems at t > 50 °C, as has been reported in the literature. The role of surface tension changes on MD separation effectiveness is recognized.

40|$|In this study, a {{bench scale}} forward osmosis (FO) process was {{operated}} using two commonly available FO membranes in different orientations {{in order to}} examine the removal of foulants in the coal seam gas (CSG) associated water, the water flux and fouling behaviours of the process were also investigated. After 48 h of fouling simulation experiment, the water flux declined by approximately 55 and 35 % of its initial level in the TFC-PRO and CTA-PRO modes (support layer facing the feed), respectively, while the flux decline in the TFC-FO and CTA-FO modes (active layer facing the feed) was insignificant. The flux decline in PRO modes was caused by the compounding effects of internal concentration polarisation and membrane fouling. However, the declined flux was completely recovered to its initial level following the hydraulic cleaning using deionised water. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) and major inorganic <b>scalants</b> (Ca, Mg and silica) in the CSG feed were effectively removed by using the FO process.

40|$|Membrane scaling and {{mitigation}} techniques during air gap {{membrane distillation}} (AGMD) of seawater were investigated. The results showed {{a strong influence}} of AGMD operating temperature on not only the process water flux but also membrane scaling and subsequent cleaning efficiency. Elevating feed/coolant temperature from 35 / 25 to 60 / 50 °C increased water flux, but also exacerbated membrane scaling of the AGMD process. Membrane scaling was more severe, and occurred at a lower water recovery (68 %) when operating at 60 / 50 °C compared to 35 / 25 °C (78 %) due to increased concentration polarisation effect. Operating temperature also affected {{the efficiency of the}} subsequent membrane cleaning. Membrane scaling that occurred at low temperature (i. e. 35 / 25 °C) was more efficiently cleaned than at high temperature (i. e. 60 / 50 °C). In addition, membrane cleaning using vinegar was much more efficient than fresh water. Nevertheless, vinegar cleaning could not completely restore the membrane surface to the original condition. Traces of residual <b>scalants</b> on the membrane surface accelerated scaling in the next operation cycle. On the other hand, anti-scalant addition could effectively control scaling. Membrane scaling during AGMD of seawater at 70 % water recovery and 60 / 50 °C was effectively controlled by anti-scalant addition...|$|R
40|$|Expolitation of coalbed methane (CBM) {{involves}} {{production of}} a massive amount saline water {{that needs to be}} properly managed for environmental protection. In this study, direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) was utilized for treatment of CBM-produced water to remove saline components in the water. Simulated CBM waters containing varying concentrations of NaCl (1, 20, and 500 mM) and NaHCO 3 (1 and 25 mM) were used as feed solutions under two transmembrane temperatures (Δ 40 and 60 °C). In short-term distillation (~ 360 min), DCMD systems showed good performance with nearly 100 % removal of salts for all solutes concentrations at both temperatures. The permeate flux increased with the feed temperature, but at a given temperature, it remained fairly stable throughout the whole operation. A gradual decline in permeate flux was observed at Δ 60 °C at high NaHCO 3 concentration (25 mM). In long-term distillation (5400 min), the presence of 25 mM NaHCO 3 further decreased the flux to 25 %– 35 % of the initial value {{toward the end of the}} operation, likely due to membrane fouling by deposition of Ca-carbonate minerals on the pore openings. Furthermore, pore wetting by the <b>scalants</b> occurred at the end of the experiment, and it increased the distillate conducitivity to 110 µS·cm− 1.

40|$|Reverse osmosis (RO) brine {{produced}} at a full-scale coal seam gas (CSG) water treatment facility was characterized with spectroscopic and other analytical techniques. A {{number of potential}} <b>scalants</b> including silica, calcium, magnesium, sulphates and carbonates, {{all of which were}} present in dissolved and non-dissolved forms, were characterized. The presence of spherical particles with a size range of 10 – 1000  nm and aggregates of 1 – 10 microns was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Those particulates contained the following metals in decreasing order: K, Si, Sr, Ca, B, Ba, Mg, P, and S. Characterization showed that nearly one-third of the total silicon in the brine was present in the particulates. Further, analysis of the RO brine suggested supersaturation and precipitation of metal carbonates and sulphates during the RO process should take place and could be responsible for subsequently capturing silica in the solid phase. However, the precipitation of crystalline carbonates and sulphates are complex. X-ray diffraction analysis did not confirm the presence of common calcium carbonates or sulphates but instead showed the presence of a suite of complex minerals, to which amorphous silica and/or silica rich compounds could have adhered.

40|$|Wood {{components}} such as cellulose, lignin and hemicelluloses {{all have}} {{potential to be}} used in biobased value-added products. Once extracted from the wood these components have to be separated and purified from co-extracted compounds. Membrane filtration can be used to achieve this separation and is believed {{to play an important role}} in biorefineries. Fouling is the single greatest obstacle to the introduction of membrane processes in biorefineries. Fouling affects membrane performance in several ways: it reduces flux, alters separation properties and necessitates frequent cleaning which shortens membrane life-time. Cleaning, used to recover flux, needs to be optimized in order to reduce downtime costs. As a rule of thumb, alkaline cleaning agents are used to remove organic matter and acid cleaning agents are used to remove inorganic <b>scalants.</b> The complex nature of process streams in biorefineries complicates the choice of cleaning agents in these applications. Lignin, extractives, polysaccharides and inorganics are all potential foulants. This work illustrates the importance of choosing the right cleaning agent, and the right sequence of cleaning agents when multistep cleaning is used. A combination of microfiltration (MF) and ultrafiltration (UF) was used to isolate hemicelluloses in thermomechanical pulp (TMP) mill process water. Suspended and colloidal matter was removed in the MF stage and hemicelluloses were concentrated and purified in the UF stage. Organic compounds are the main constituents of the process water and, hence, alkaline cleaning is assumed to be the most efficient cleaning method in this case. However, in this work it is shown that alkaline cleaning is not necessarily the most effective cleaning method. The influence of different cleaning agents on flux recovery when cleaning MF and UF membranes after treatment of TMP process water was investigated. Methods to measure fouling and determine efficiency of different cleaning agents on flux recovery are presented...|$|R
40|$|Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is a non-destructive, {{real time}} {{monitoring}} technique {{that has the}} ability to detect inorganic and organic foulants on a RO membrane surface. For the inorganic fouling study, calcium sulphate (CaSO 4) and calcium carbonate (CaCO 3), which are two typical, <b>scalants</b> observed in RO plants, were used to assess feasibility of EIS to detect inorganic fouling. EIS signals were obtained across a frequency range of 10 - 1 to 106 Hz and it can be concluded that conductance values obtained at low frequencies (10 - 100 Hz), co-relates to the environment on the membrane surface. Scale formation was detected before any significant permeate flux decline was observed. Hence, conductance at low frequencies is the most relevant EIS parameter for scale detection in RO systems. Given the instability of EIS signals at high frequencies, the same approach of measuring conductance at low frequencies was also applied to the organic fouling experiments. Different concentrations of Tryptophan, alginate and humic acid, in the presence of divalent ions (Ca 2 +) were used to mimic typical organic foulants and were filtered in batch mode till 85 % recovery was achieved. EIS was operated throughout the filtration and the conductance was measured across a range of low frequencies. Based on conductance data at 38 Hz, EIS is able to successfully characterize the initial deposition of organic fouling on the membrane. However, results obtained from experiments using higher feed concentrations did not detect significant changes highlighting the limitation in using EIS for monitoring organic fouling formation for feed solutions above a fouling threshold limit. Trends obtained during this study further ascertain the ability of EIS to detect the formation of fouling and to characterize the organic fouling layer during the initial adsorption phase on the membrane surface. In conclusion, EIS is capable of monitoring inorganic scaling and organic fouling in situ and in real time through the analysis of the electrical properties of the membrane surface. In particular, in systems that experience organic fouling, EIS can identify and determine the composition during the initial stages of organic fouling on the RO membrane. Therefore, proving that EIS is a novel and effective technique that can be applied to RO systems for wastewater treatment...|$|R
40|$|Membrane {{distillation}} (MD) is {{an emerging}} low energy desalination technology, where low-grade heat source can be utilized to provide heat to the feed, offering an alternative solution to saline concentrate treatment. Yet, MD still suffers prominently from scaling, wetting and low flux. To overcome these problems, methods of fouling control are frequently investigated, such as process optimization by selecting the appropriate operational parameters and cleaning protocols, and refining the intrinsic {{properties of the}} membrane {{to meet the needs}} of membrane distillation, in terms of enhanced fouling/wetting resistance and reduced mass transfer resistance. This dissertation examined the fouling mechanisms in MD process by different substances in treating saline concentrates produced from coal seam gas generation, as well as the desalination of brackish groundwater. In particular, the fouling mechanisms of substances such as alkaline <b>scalants,</b> silica, and humic acids were studied. During the treatment of coal seam gas water with the presence of silica, magnesium formed porous structured depositions with silica, which caused a less severe flux decline as compared to the feed without silica. Initially, the precipitation of calcite was spotted, followed by the deposition of magnesium silicate and sodium chloride. The roles of fouling control via intermittent cleaning, mechanical agitations, as well as an integrated thermal crystallizer were investigated. As such, cleaning of the membrane prior to catastrophic membrane degradation is a critical operating protocol as an approach to the maintenance of membrane performance. It should be noted that the approaches to fouling control should be carefully selected according to the specific fouling mechanism by the pollutants present in the feed. While vigorous agitations might be undesirable in MD process for the treatment of inorganic feed, it was discovered that the application of an integrated thermal crystallizer could help sustain membrane performance and harvest crystals. On the other hand, high speed transverse vibration at 500 rpm was found to be effective in fouling control for the treatment of brackish groundwater concentrates with a considerable amount of humic aicds. This work also explored the effect of surface engineering on membrane performance for different MD processes. To be specific, two approaches to surface functionalization were investigated as the purpose of different MD applications, namely Janus hydrophobic-hydrophilic membrane and superhydrophobic surface. To fabricate a Janus membrane, a facile solution-immersion method in the dopamine solution was applied. Significant increase of flux measured in a submerged direct contact membrane distillation configuration was observed from the modified membrane by this approach. The thickness of the hydrophilic layer determined the flux values and the rejection rate for long-term operation in saline solution; the trade-off caused by these two parameters should be carefully examined during the design of membrane. The maximum flux enhancement achieved by the Janus membranes was 120 % as compared to the nascent membranes. To fabricate the superhydrophobic surface, the membrane was immersed in the dopamine solution, followed by the deposition of silica nano-particles and low surface energy material of 1 H, 1 H, 2 H, 2 H-perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane (PDTS). The modified membrane showed enhanced anti-fouling and anti-wetting properties in a submerged vacuum membrane distillation setup for the desalination of brackish groundwater concentrates and sodium chloride solution. Both modified membranes showed superior stability in long-term desalination processes for MD applications...|$|R
40|$|Salinity of {{brackish}} groundwater in the San Joaquin Valley (SJV) {{is typically}} {{in the range}} of about 3, 000 - 30, 000 mg/L total dissolved solids (TDS) In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the potential use of membrane desalination technology for reducing the salinity SJV brackish water. Membrane desalination of SJV brackish water would have to be carried out at relatively high water recovery {{in order to reduce the}} volume of generated RO concentrate. However, at high water recoveries the concentration of mineral salt ions on the feed-side of the membrane may increase to levels that exceed the solubility limits of various sparingly water-soluble mineral salts (e. g., calcium sulfate, calcium carbonate, and barium sulfate). The ensuing crystallization of these minerals results in scale build-up that leads to permeate flux decline, shortening of membrane life, and thus a reduction in process efficiency and increased operational cost. Therefore, process strategies must be designed to enhance product water recovery, while reducing the potential for mineral salt scaling. Accordingly, the principal objective of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility of RO desalting of SJV brackish water. The present project focused on a systematic evaluation of: (a) the recovery limits for RO desalination of SJV AD water that are imposed by mineral salt scaling, and (b) the integration of accelerated precipitation (AP) of mineral salts with RO desalting to mitigate scaling and enable high RO recovery. AP treatment would serve to demineralize and desupersaturate the RO primary or secondary feed with respect to mineral salt <b>scalants.</b> In the first phase of the project, a systematic analysis based on multi-electrolyte thermodynamic solubility calculations was carried to determine the recovery limits due to mineral scaling. Subsequently, a detailed theoretical analysis and laboratory bench-scale studies were carried out with field water samples to assess mineral scaling propensity for a number of specific SJV water sources. In the second phase of the study, the integration of accelerated precipitation with RO desalting was investigated as a potential approach to lowering source water scaling propensity to enable enhanced water product water recovery. Analysis of historical water quality data and of recently obtained water field samples, from various locations in the San Joaquin Valley, demonstrated a significant variability of water salinity and scaling propensity with respect to calcite, gypsum, barite, and silica. The above analysis and experimental RO scaling tests suggested that the expected range of product water recovery by RO desalting across the SJV can be {{in the range of}} 50 %- 70 % for most of the sites, with the exception of the ERR site for which a much higher recovery was estimated (in excess of 90 %). The integration of accelerated precipitation with RO desalting was shown to be technically feasible for the range of brackish water quality in the San Joaquin Valley. In this process, the concentrate from primary RO (PRO) desalting would be treated by accelerated precipitation softening (i. e., chemical demineralization) or desupersaturated to lower the scaling propensity of this stream, followed by secondary RO (SRO) desalting. Overall recovery of up to ~ 90 %- 95 % could be achieved at an estimated cost of $ 0. 56 -$ 0. 98 per m 3 product water, with the ACP process accounting for about 15 %- 25 % of the overall water production cost. The present study demonstrated provided a framework for assessing RO recovery limits and thus identifying potential hurdles that should be addressed in pilot studies and ultimately in the design and implementation of large-scale RO desalting processes. It is expected that, the methods developed in the present study for scale characterization, evaluation of accelerated precipitation effectiveness and RO process performance analysis will significantly advance the knowledge base needed to arrive at optimal design and deployment of future RO brackish water desalination strategies for the San Joaquin Valley...|$|R
40|$|Various regions {{around the}} world are confronted with dwindling water {{supplies}} and thus the need for exploiting non-traditional inland brackish water resource, as well as reclamation and reuse of municipal wastewater and agricultural drainage (AD) water. Reverse osmosis (RO) membrane desalination is the primary technology for inland brackish water desalting. However, successful implementation of RO technology requires operation at high product water recovery (> 85 %) in order to minimize the volume of generated concentrate (i. e., brine). Brine management is a key factor governing the economics of inland water desalination. Therefore, brine volume reduction is critical to enabling various brine residual management options. At high water recovery, dissolved mineral salts (e. g., CaSO 4, BaSO 4, CaCO 3) may become concentrated above their solubility limits and may crystallize in the bulk and onto the surface of the RO membranes. Mineral crystallization leads to membrane scaling and hence leads to flux decline, increased process costs, and shortening of membrane life. Therefore, the attainable desalination water recovery is limited by mineral scaling. Many inland brackish water sources contain high concentrations of sparingly soluble mineral salts. In certain areas, such as in California's San Joaquin Valley (SJV), brackish water is near saturation with respect to calcium sulfate and barium sulfate. Based on the current work, single-stage RO desalination in SJV would generally be limited to ~ 50 - 70 %. In order to desalt brackish water of high mineral scaling propensity at a high recovery level (> 85 %), the feasibility of intermediate concentrate demineralization (ICD) of primary RO (PRO) concentrate, as a means of enabling secondary RO (SRO) desalting, was investigated with a focus on brackish water having high concentrations of gypsum salt precursor ions (i. e., calcium and sulfate). Accordingly, a two-step chemically-enhanced seeded precipitation (CESP) ICD process was developed in which the PRO concentrate is treated prior to further SRO desalting. The first step is lime precipitation softening (PS) which serves to induce sufficient CaCO 3 crystallization in order to remove residual antiscalant (AS), a PRO feed treatment additive (generally polymeric) used for scale control, that would otherwise inhibit precipitation (in the ICD) of the target mineral salt <b>scalants.</b> Subsequently, gypsum seeded precipitation (GSP) is carried out to reduce the level of calcium sulfate saturation. The CESP process was evaluated experimentally, in a batch crystallizer, using synthetic PRO concentrate and also PRO concentrate generated in the field, from AD water, using a spiral-wound RO pilot plant. The effect of residual AS (from the PRO stage) on retardation of mineral salt precipitation (in the ICD) was evaluated using both a generic (polyacrylic acid) and a commercial AS. Laboratory batch CESP studies were carried out in which the CESP process conditions were first optimized with respect to the required lime and gypsum seed doses. For raw brackish water that was about 98 % saturated with respect to gypsum, PRO desalination at 52 %- 62 % recovery yielded a brine stream 70 - 150 % above saturation. CESP treatment, at lime doses of 0. 25 - 0. 35 mg/L and gypsum seeding of 4 - 5 g/L, enabled reduction of gypsum concentration to only 10 - 15 % above its saturation. In general, the sequential processes of lime treatment for 10 - 20 minutes followed by ~ 1 hr of GSP were sufficient to achieve the above level of gypsum desupersaturation. GSP alone reduced gypsum saturation by only ~ 5 %. PRO brine desupersaturation via CESP was feasible due to the effectiveness of AS removal (up to 90 % for AS content of up to 10 mg/L in the PRO brine). Analysis of AS removal using a fundamental AS adsorption model, along with measurements of the size distribution of precipitating CaCO 3 crystals, indicated that the area for AS adsorption provided by lime-induced nucleation of CaCO 3 crystals is the key factor governing AS removal. In order to establish the feasibility of deploying CESP as a continuous process, a numerical model was developed for a fluidized bed reactor for the GSP stage. Model simulations indicated that the required level of calcium sulfate desupersaturation could be maintained by solids recycling leading to a steady-state particle size distribution. Process simulations and economic analysis were carried out for the integrated process of PRO, CESP and SRO (PRO-CESP-SRO) demonstrating the existence of an optimal recovery (with respect to product water treatment cost). For the evaluated SJV brackish AD water source, the optimal recovery was about 93 %. Overall brackish water treatment cost, when considering the disposal cost of high salinity AD water, was lower for PRO-CESP-SRO relative to a similar process based on conventional PS or utilizing a single stage RO which would be of limited recovery (< 62 %). The current work suggests that, at inland areas with limited options for management of high salinity water, high recovery desalination can be economically attractive when considering the reduction in brine disposal cost and the value of the product water produced by the PRO-CESP-SRO process...|$|R
