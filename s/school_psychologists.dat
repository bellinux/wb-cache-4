25|$|<b>School</b> <b>psychologists</b> provide {{intervention}} and treatment to reach goals. They assist with trauma and crisis; work with children, teachers, and families {{to deal with}} hurdles that are preventing success; educate and expand skills to cope with problems. They utilize prevention and early intervention to limit troubles in children’s lives and in the school environment. <b>School</b> <b>psychologists</b> help create an equal and encouraging school, bring attention to mental health issues and develop {{ways to deal with}} issues individually and school-wide, they team up with teachers and parents to address effective behavior plans, and ensure acceptance and value of diversity. <b>School</b> <b>psychologists</b> administer assessments and address difficulties all students face in psychological, social, personal, emotional, and educational/learning development. They also review and revise techniques to deal with problems of students and in schools to maintain a good, safe setting. They provide consultation and case management by ensuring students’ needs are met; speak out for students {{in and out of the}} school; make sure all people involved with the student are aware of the needs of the student, what resources are available, and how to get the services; aid in the communication between parents, schools, and community services; and modify achievement plans to best meet needs of student. <b>School</b> <b>psychologists</b> seek assistance from community services in mental health, health, and crisis response; educate the public, parents, and schools through trainings on issues facing students and schools. Finally, <b>School</b> <b>Psychologists</b> are experts in research. As noted by the National Association of <b>School</b> <b>Psychologists</b> (NASP, 2007) and the American Psychological Association (APA, 2007), <b>school</b> <b>psychologists</b> adhere to the scientist-practitioner framework and make decisions based on empirical research. <b>School</b> <b>psychologists</b> must be aware of and contribute to the study of the best approaches to helping students, families, and schools reach their goals.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} various role-definer groups' perceptions of the <b>school</b> <b>psychologist's</b> role with regard to real behavior and ideal behavior. The role-definer groups were: special education teacher, special education director, elementary school teacher, elementary school principal and <b>school</b> <b>psychologist.</b> An instrument was developed and piloted on randomly selected members from each role-definer group throughout the states of Indiana and Michigan. Upon revision, the 15 -item instrument in questionnaire form was sent to 50 randomly selected members from each role-definer group in each state. A total of 325 completed questionnaires (65 %) were returned for inclusion in the analyses. The subjects responded to each of the 15 items with a Likert-type response on a 7 -point scale. An analysis of variance with contrast was utilized to test for any differences between the <b>school</b> <b>psychologist</b> and each of the other role-definer groups in how they perceived the real role functions and the ideal role functions of the <b>school</b> <b>psychologist.</b> There were some significant differences, primarily related to direct service activities vs. consultant-type activities. A one way analysis of variance was utilized to test for any differences between the Indiana role-definer groups and the Michigan role-definer groups in how they perceived the real role functions and the ideal role functions of the <b>school</b> <b>psychologist.</b> There were some significant differences, primarily related to the specialization of expected services from the <b>school</b> <b>psychologist.</b> It appeared that less specialization was expected from the Michigan <b>school</b> <b>psychologist</b> than from the Indiana <b>school</b> <b>psychologist,</b> possibly due in part to the difference in administrative models utilized by the states. A correlated t-test was utilized to test for any differences in how each role-definer group perceived the <b>school</b> <b>psychologist's</b> real behavior compared to the <b>school</b> <b>psychologist's</b> ideal behavior. Significant differences were found for 70 of the 75 possible hypotheses (i. e., 15 items x 5 role-definer groups).

25|$|School {{psychology}} {{dates back}} to the beginning of American psychology in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The field is tied to both functional and clinical psychology. School psychology actually came out of functional psychology. <b>School</b> <b>psychologists</b> were interested in childhood behaviors, learning processes, and dysfunction with life or in the brain itself. They wanted to understand the causes of the behaviors and their effects on learning. In addition to its origins in functional psychology, school psychology is also the earliest example of clinical psychology, beginning around 1890. While both clinical and <b>school</b> <b>psychologists</b> wanted to help improve the lives of children, they approached it in different ways. <b>School</b> <b>psychologists</b> were concerned with school learning and childhood behavioral problems, which largely contrasts the mental health focus of clinical psychologists.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{clinical}} psychology and counseling psychology, which often are doctoral-only fields, school psychology includes individuals with Master's (M.A., M.S., M.Ed.), Specialist (Ed.S. or SSP), Certificate of Advanced Graduate Studies (CAGS), and doctoral (Ph.D., Psy.D. or Ed.D.) degrees. In the past, a master's degree {{was considered the}} standard for practice in schools, but the National Association of <b>School</b> <b>Psychologists</b> currently recognizes the 60-credit-hour Specialist degree as the most appropriate level of training needed for entry-level school-based practice. According to the NASP Research Committee (NASP Research Committee, 2007), in 2004-05, 33% of <b>school</b> <b>psychologists</b> possessed master's degrees, 35% possessed Specialist (Ed.S. or SSP) degrees, and 32% possessed doctoral (Ph.D., Psy.D., or Ed.D.) degrees.
