500|$|The Kentucky Headhunters {{borrowed}} $4,500 {{to record}} a demo album, which included seven original songs, plus covers of Bill Monroe's [...] "Walk <b>Softly</b> <b>on</b> This Heart of Mine," [...] Henson Cargill's [...] "Skip a Rope" [...] and Don Gibson's [...] "Oh Lonesome Me." [...] Originally intended to be sold at the band's live shows, the demo tape {{came to the attention}} of the Nashville music community. Although Martin said that the band had not seriously considered signing a record deal, the band pursued one through the suggestion of its manager, Mitchell Fox. Harold Shedd, a record producer who was then the head of Mercury Records, helped sign The Kentucky Headhunters to the label in 1989.|$|E
500|$|Mercury {{released}} the demo in 1989 as The Kentucky Headhunters' debut album, Pickin' on Nashville. The album produced four singles, {{all of which}} reached top 40 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) chart. The first of these, the [...] "Walk <b>Softly</b> <b>on</b> This Heart of Mine" [...] cover, peaked at number 25 in December 1989. After it came [...] "Dumas Walker," [...] about a then-74-year-old marbles player who owned a liquor store that the band frequented. According to Doug, Mercury Records was initially reluctant to release the song as a single: [...] " [...] thought it was too regional, {{and that no one}} outside the area would get it, but what they didn't see, was the reaction we got to it every night that we played it in front of a crowd, and it didn't matter where we were playing either." [...] The single peaked at number 15 on the Billboard chart.|$|E
500|$|Sinatra started 1967 with {{a series}} of {{recording}} sessions with Antônio Carlos Jobim. He recorded one of his most famous collaborations with Jobim, the Grammy-nominated album Francis Albert Sinatra & Antônio Carlos Jobim, {{which was one of the}} best-selling albums of the year, behind the Beatles's Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. According to Santopietro the album [...] "consists of an extraordinarily effective blend of bossa nova and slightly swinging jazz vocals, and succeeds in creating an unbroken mood of romance and regret". Writer Stan Cornyn noted that Sinatra sang so <b>softly</b> <b>on</b> the album that it was comparable to the time that he suffered from a vocal hemorrhage in 1950. Sinatra also released the album The World We Knew, which features a chart-topping duet of [...] "Somethin' Stupid" [...] with daughter Nancy. In December, Sinatra collaborated with Duke Ellington on the album Francis A. & Edward K.. According to Granata, the recording of [...] "Indian Summer" [...] on the album was a favorite of Riddle's, noting the [...] "contemplative mood [...] is heightened by a Johnny Hodges alto sax solo that will bring a tear to your eye". With Sinatra in mind, singer-songwriter Paul Anka wrote the song [...] "My Way", using the melody of the French [...] "Comme d'habitude" [...] ("As Usual"), composed by Claude François and Jacques Revaux. Sinatra recorded it just after Christmas 1968. [...] "My Way", Sinatra's best-known song on the Reprise label, was not an instant success, charting at #27 in the US and #5 in the UK, but it remained in the UK charts for 122 weeks, including 75 non-consecutive weeks in the Top 40, between April 1969 and September 1971, which was still a record in 2015. Sinatra told songwriter Ervin Drake in the 1970s that he [...] "detested" [...] singing the song, because he believed audiences would think it was a [...] "self-aggrandizing tribute", professing that he [...] "hated boastfulness in others".|$|E

2500|$|Two teams, each {{consisting}} of one celebrity player and one [...] "civilian" [...] contestant, competed. The word to be conveyed (the [...] "password") {{was given to}} one player on each team, and was shown onscreen to viewers as well as spoken <b>softly</b> <b>on</b> the audio track. Game play alternated between the two teams. On each team, the player who was given the password gave a one-word clue from which their partner attempted to guess the password. If the partner failed to guess the password within the allotted five-second time limit, or if an illegal clue was given (two or more words, a hyphenated word, [...] "coined" [...] words, or any part or form of the password), play passed to the opposing team.|$|E

2500|$|The Entry, Descent and Landing Demonstrator Module (EDM) called Schiaparelli, was {{intended}} to provide the European Space Agency (ESA) and Russia's Roscosmos with the technology for landing {{on the surface of}} Mars. It was launched together with the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) on 14 March 2016 and was scheduled to land <b>softly</b> <b>on</b> 19 October 2016. No signal indicating a successful landing was received, and on 21 October 2016 NASA released a Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter [...] showing {{what appears to be the}} lander crash site. [...] The lander was equipped with a non-rechargeable electric battery with enough power for four sols. The soft landing should have taken place on Meridiani Planum during the dust storm season, which would have provided a unique chance to characterize a dust-loaded atmosphere during entry and descent, and to conduct surface measurements associated with a dust-rich environment.|$|E
2500|$|Despite their name, aerogels are solid, rigid, and dry {{materials}} {{that do not}} resemble a gel in their physical properties: the name {{comes from the fact}} that they are made from gels. Pressing <b>softly</b> <b>on</b> an aerogel typically does not leave even a minor mark; pressing more firmly will leave a permanent depression. Pressing extremely firmly will cause a catastrophic breakdown in the sparse structure, causing it to shatter like glass– a property known as friability; although more modern variations do not suffer from this. Despite the fact that it is prone to shattering, it is very strong structurally. Its impressive load bearing abilities are due to the dendritic microstructure, in which spherical particles of average size (2–5nm) are fused together into clusters. These clusters form a three-dimensional highly porous structure of almost fractal chains, with pores just under 100nm. The average size and density of the pores can be controlled during the manufacturing process.|$|E
2500|$|In 1923, Mussolini sent Italian {{forces to}} invade Corfu during the Corfu incident. In the end, the League of Nations proved powerless, and Greece {{was forced to}} comply with Italian demands. Writing of Mussolini's foreign policy, the American {{historian}} Gerhard Weinberg said: If the new regime Benito Mussolini installed in 1922 on {{the ruins of the}} old glorified war as a sign of vitality and repudiated pacifism as a form of decay, the lesson drawn from the terrible battles against Austria on the Isonzo river—in which the Italians fought far better than popular imagination often allows—was that the tremendous material and technical preparations needed for modern war were simply beyond the contemporary capacity of the country. This was almost certainly a correct perception, but, given the ideology of Fascism with its emphasis on the moral benefits of war, it did not lead to the conclusion that an Italy without a big stick had best speak very, very <b>softly.</b> <b>On</b> the contrary, the new regime drew the opposite conclusion. Noisy eloquence and rabid journalism might be substituted for serious preparations for war, a procedure that was harmless enough if no one took any of it seriously, but a certain road to disaster once some outside and Mussolini inside the country came to believe that the [...] "eight million bayonets" [...] of the Duce's imagination actually existed.|$|E
