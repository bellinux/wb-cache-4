40|$|Abstract Background Haematological traits, which {{consist of}} mainly three {{components:}} leukocyte traits, erythrocyte traits and platelet traits, play extremely {{important role in}} animal immune function and disease resistance. But knowledge of the genetic background controlling variability of these traits is very limited, especially in swine. Results In the present study, 18 haematological traits (7 leukocyte traits, 7 erythrocyte traits and 4 platelet traits) were measured in a pig resource population consisting of 368 purebred piglets of three breeds (Landrace, Large White and Songliao Black Pig), after inoculation with the <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> <b>vaccine</b> when the pigs were 21 days old. A whole-genome scan of QTL for these traits was performed using 206 microsatellite markers covering all 18 autosomes and the X chromosome. Using variance component analysis based on a linear mixed model and the false discovery rate (FDR) test, 35 QTL with FDR FDR FDR Conclusions Very few QTL were previously identified for hematological traits of pigs and never in purebred populations. Most of the QTL detected here, in particular the QTL for the platelet traits, have not been reported before. Our results lay important foundation for identifying the causal genes underlying the hematological trait variations in pigs. </p...|$|E

To identify genomic regions responsible for immune capacity traits in swine, a genome-wide association study was conducted. In total, 675 pigs were included. At 21 days of age, all piglets were vaccinated with modified live classical <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Blood samples were sampled when the piglets were 20 and 35 days of age, respectively. Four traits, including Interferon-gamma (IFN-c) and Interleukin 10 (IL- 10) levels, the ratio of IFN-c to IL- 10 and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) blocking percentage to CSFV in serum were measured. All the samples were genotyped for 62, 163 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) using the Illumina porcineSNP 60 k BeadChip. After quality control, 46, 079 SNPs were selected for association tests based on a single-locus regression model. To tackle the issue of multiple testing, 10, 000 permutations were performed to determine the chromosome-wise and genome-wise significance level. In total, 32 SNPs with chromosome-wise significance level (including 4 SNPs with genome-wise significance level) were identified. These SNPs account for 3. 23 % to 13. 81 % of the total phenotypic variance individually.

40|$|Abstract Background Increased disease {{resistance}} through improved general immune capacity {{would be beneficial}} for the welfare and productivity of farm animals. T lymphocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood {{play an important role}} in immune capacity and {{disease resistance}} in animals. However, very little research to date has focused on quantitative trait loci (QTL) for T lymphocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood in swine. Results In the study, experimental animals consist of 446 piglets from three different breed populations. To identify QTL for T lymphocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood in swine, the proportions of CD 4 +, CD 8 +, CD 4 +CD 8 +, CD 4 +CD 8 -, CD 4 -CD 8 +, and CD 4 -CD 8 - T cells and the ratio of CD 4 +:CD 8 + T cells were measured for all individuals before and after challenge with modified live CSF (classical <b>swine</b> <b>fever)</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Based on the combined data of individuals from three breed populations, genome-wide scanning of QTL for these traits was performed based on a variance component model, and the genome wide significance level for declaring QTL was determined via permutation tests as well as FDR (false discovery rate) correction. A total of 27 QTL (two for CD 4 +CD 8 +, one for CD 4 +CD 8 -, three for CD 4 -CD 8 +, two for CD 4 -CD 8 -, nine for CD 4 +, two for CD 8 +, and eight for CD 4 +:CD 8 + ratio) were identified with significance level of FDR FDR FDR Conclusions Within these QTL regions, a number of known genes having potential relationships with the studied traits may serve as candidate genes for these traits. Our findings herein are helpful for identification of the causal genes underlying these immune-related trait and selection for immune capacity of individuals in swine breeding in the future. </p...|$|E
40|$|There are {{two types}} of {{classical}} <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> <b>vaccines</b> available: the classical live and the recently developed E 2 subunit vaccines. The live Chinese strain vaccine is the most widely used. After a single vaccination, it confers solid immunity within a few days that appears to persist lifelong. The E 2 subunit vaccine induces immunity from approximately 10 ¿ 14 days after a single vaccination. The immunity may persist for more than a year, but is then not complete. The Chinese strain vaccine may establish a strong herd immunity 1 ¿ 2 weeks earlier than the E 2 vaccine. The ability of the Chinese vaccine strain to prevent congenital infection has not been reported, but the E 2 subunit vaccine does not induce complete protection against congenital infection. Immunological mechanisms that underlie the protective immunity are still to be elucidated. Both types of vaccine are considered to be safe. A great advantage of the E 2 subunit vaccine is that it allows differentiation of infected pigs from vaccinated pigs and is referred to as a DIVA vaccine. However, the companion diagnostic Erns ELISA to actually make that differentiation should be improved. Many approaches to develop novel vaccines have been described, but none of these is likely to result in a new DIVA vaccine reaching the market in the next 5 ¿ 10 years. Countries where classical <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> is endemic can best control the infection by systematic vaccination campaigns, accompanied by the normal diagnostic procedures and control measures. Oral vaccination of wild boar may contribute to lowering the incidence of classical <b>swine</b> <b>fever,</b> and consequently diminishing the threat of virus introduction into domestic pigs. Free countries should not vaccinate and should be highly alert to rapidly diagnose any new outbreak.

Results To identify genomic regions responsible for these immune traits in swine, a genome-wide association study was conducted. A total of 675 pigs of three breeds were involved in the study. At 21 days of age, all individuals were vaccinated with modified live classical <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Blood samples were collected when the piglets were 20 and 35 days of age, respectively.

All the samples were genotyped for 62, 163 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) using the Illumina porcineSNP 60 k BeadChip. 40833 SNPs were selected after quality control for association tests between SNPs and each immune trait considered based on a single-locus regression model. To tackle the issue of multiple testing in GWAS, 10, 000 permutations were performed to determine the chromosome-wise and genome-wise significance levels of association tests. In total, 61 SNPs with chromosome-wise significance level and 3 SNPs with genome-wise significance level were identified. 27 significant SNPs were located within the immune-related QTL regions reported in previous studies. Furthermore, several significant SNPs fell into the regions harboring known immunity-related genes, 14 of them fell into the regions which harbor some known T cell-related genes.

40|$|Abstract Background Glycoprotein E 2, the immunodominant protein of {{classical}} <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> virus (CSFV), can induce neutralizing antibodies and confer protective immunity in pigs. Our previous phylogenetic {{analysis showed that}} subgroup 2. 1 viruses branched away from subgroup 1. 1, the vaccine C-strain lineage, and became dominant in China. The E 2 glycoproteins of CSFV C-strain and recent subgroup 2. 1 field isolates are genetically different. However, {{it has not been}} clearly demonstrated how this diversity affects antigenicity of the protein. Results Antigenic variation of glycoprotein E 2 was observed not only between CSFV vaccine C-strain and subgroup 2. 1 strains, but also among strains of the same subgroup 2. 1 as determined by ELISA-based binding assay using pig antisera to the C-strain and a representative subgroup 2. 1 strain QZ- 07 currently circulating in China. Antigenic incompatibility of E 2 proteins markedly reduced neutralization efficiency against heterologous strains. Single amino acid substitutions of D 705 N, L 709 P, G 713 E, N 723 S, and S 779 A on C-strain recombinant E 2 (rE 2) proteins significantly increased heterologous binding to anti-QZ- 07 serum, suggesting that these residues may be responsible for the antigenic variation between the C-strain and subgroup 2. 1 strains. Notably, a G 713 E substitution caused the most dramatic enhancement of binding of the variant C-strain rE 2 protein to anti-QZ- 07 serum. Multiple sequence alignment revealed that the glutamic acid residue at this position is conserved within group 2 strains, while the glycine residue is invariant among the vaccine strains, highlighting the role of the residue at this position as a major determinant of antigenic variation of E 2. A variant Simpson's index analysis showed that both codons and amino acids of the residues contributing to antigenic variation have undergone similar diversification. Conclusions These results demonstrate that CSFV vaccine C-strain and group 2 strains circulating in China differ in the antigenicity of their E 2 glycoproteins. Systematic site-directed mutagenesis of the antigenic units has revealed residues that limit cross-reactivity. Our findings may be useful for the development of serological differential assays and improvement of immunogenicity of novel classical <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> <b>vaccines.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Prophylactic {{vaccination}} using live attenuated classical <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> (CSF) <b>vaccines</b> {{has been}} a very effective method to control the disease in endemic regions and during outbreaks in previously disease-free areas. These vaccines confer effective protection against the disease at early times post-vaccination although the mechanisms mediating the protection are poorly characterized. Here we present the events occurring after the administration of our in-house developed live attenuated marker vaccine, FlagT 4 Gv. We previously reported that FlagT 4 Gv intramuscular (IM) administered conferred effective protection against intranasal challenge with virulent CSFV (BICv) as early as 7 days post-vaccination. Here we report that FlagT 4 Gv is able to induce protection against disease as early as three days post-vaccination. Immunohistochemical testing of tissues from FlagT 4 Gv-inoculated animals showed that tonsils were colonized by the vaccine virus by day 3 post-inoculation. There was a complete absence of BICv in tonsils of FlagT 4 Gv-inoculated animals which had been intranasal (IN) challenged with BICv 3 days after FlagT 4 Gv infection, confirming that FlagT 4 Gv inoculation confers sterile immunity.

50|$|In many European {{countries}} where certain diseases {{have not been}} detected, (PRRS, TGE, <b>swine</b> <b>fever,</b> etc.) <b>vaccines</b> are not usually given. In organic pig production, respiratory diseases and lameness have been cited as the most common health detriments, and depending on the location, a lesser prevalence exists conventional production. Since antibiotics {{are not allowed to}} maintain the organic integrity of an animal, some producers will forgo antibiotics altogether, even with sick animals occurring in the system. However, according to USDA-NOP Guidelines, antibiotics and other treatments that no longer make the animal organic are required to maintain overall herd health. The use of antibiotics in herds with organic fattening pigs is lower compared to herds with conventional pigs. This is probably a result of the alternative system leading to a lower infection level, since no difference in mortality pigs could be discovered. As a large percentage of organic pork production systems are pasture-based, or not living on concrete, a degree of risk is present from soil based pathogenic exposure. There are options for producers, including organically approved bio-control agents, diatomaceous earth (DE), and acidified grain rations, among others. However, many of these contain anecdotal evidence only, and the study on pasture rotation to control parasitic infections is largely unknown and research is required.|$|R
40|$|E 2 {{is one of}} {{the three}} {{envelope}} glycoproteins of classical <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> virus (CSFV). Previous studies indicate that E 2 is involved in several functions, including virus attachment and entry to target cells, production of antibodies, induction of protective immune response in swine, and virulence. Here, we have investigated the role of E 2 glycosylation of the highly virulent CSFV strain Brescia in infection of the natural host. Seven putative glycosylation sites in E 2 were modified by site-directed mutagenesis of a CSFV Brescia infectious clone (BICv). A panel of virus mutants was obtained and used to investigate whether the removal of putative glycosylation sites in the E 2 glycoprotein would affect viral virulence/pathogenesis in swine. We observed that rescue of viable virus was completely impaired by removal of all putative glycosylation sites in E 2 but restored when mutation N 185 A reverted to wild-type asparagine produced viable virus that was attenuated in swine. Single mutations of each of the E 2 glycosylation sites showed that amino acid N 116 (N 1 v virus) was responsible for BICv attenuation. N 1 v efficiently protected swine from challenge with virulent BICv at 3 and 28 days postinfection, suggesting that glycosylation of E 2 could be modified for development of classical <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> live attenuated <b>vaccines...</b>|$|R

Single or double substitutions of those amino acids in BICv E 2 to CS E 2 residues did not affect virulence. Groups of amino acids were then substituted in BICv E 2 to CS E 2 residues. Mutant 32 v, with six substitutions between residues 975 and 1059, and mutant 33 v, with six substitutions between 955 and 994, induced disease indistinguishable from BICv. Mutant 31 v, with seven substitutions between residues 882 and 958, induced a delayed onset of lethal disease. Amino acids abrogating BICv virulence were then determined by progressively introducing six CS residues into 31 v. Mutant 39 v, containing nine residue substitutions, was virulent. Mutant 40 v, containing ten residue substitutions, induced mild disease. Mutant 42 v, containing twelve substitutions, and mutant 43 v, with an amino acid composition identical to 358 v, were attenuated in swine indicating that all substitutions were necessary for attenuation of the highly virulent strain Brescia.

When the tick is infected by B. crocidurae, the disease affects its genetic organ, the testes in males and the ovaries in females. The tick transmits the African <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> virus only in Spain and Portugal.|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a system of porcine {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} for the synthesis of antibodies in vitro, induced by partially purified African <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> virus particles inactivated with formaldehyde. The antibodies synthesized were detected by a radioimmunoassay with a sensitivity of 3 ng of immunoglobulin. Primary responses were dependent on supernatants from peripheral blood mononuclear cells incubated with concanavalin A, macrophages and T lymphocytes. Secondary responses did not require concanavalin A-conditioned medium. The kinetics of antibody synthesis was similar in both primary and secondary responses, but the extent of synthesis was four to five times larger in the secondary than in the primary response. The antibodies synthesized in vitro were specific for African <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> virus antigens (and did not react with viral antigen other than that from African <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> virus particles), in contrast to pokeweed mitogen-induced antibodies, which reacted with all the antigens tested. African <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> virus-induced antibodies did not neutralize the virus. These results and the inability of the virus to stimulate a primary response in the absence of concanavalin A supernatants indicate that inactivated African <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> virus is not a polyclonal stimulator...|$|R

50|$|In {{response}} to an outbreak of African <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> virus on the island in 1978, U.S. agricultural authorities insisted upon total eradication of Haiti's pig population. The Program for the Eradication of Porcine <b>Swine</b> <b>Fever</b> and for the Development of Pig Raising (PEPPADEP) caused widespread hardship among the peasant population, who bred pigs as an investment.|$|R
40|$|The first {{findings}} of classical <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> in wild boar occured {{in the rural}} district Ostprignitz-Ruppin of Brandenburg in March 1995. Up to this time the area {{was considered to be}} free of <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> in domestic and wild boars. The <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> cases were marked particulary by the occurence of dead games and clinically discreased individuals {{as well as by the}} involment of young wild boars (In Brandenburg the eradication programm of classical <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> was based on intensive hunting and on oral immunization with an attenuated type C vaccine (so called Dessauer wild boar lure) carried out within the frame of a field trial. During six immunizations (spring 1995 to autumn 1997) 666300 baits were set out at lure places. On average 80. 7 % of the lures were not traceable afterwards. The success of oral immunization was examined by the development of <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> positive-findings within the <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> endangered district and by the seroconversion in the entire vaccination area. Due to the oral immunization the classical <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> prevalence decreased from 4. 65 % in March 1995 to 0. 58 % in December 1997. After the third immunization the seroconversion reached on average rates between 30 % and 35 %. The seroconversion increased with carcass weight and with number of subsequent immunization. During the investigation period the rate of seroconversion in wild boars up to 17 kg carcass weight was 13. 2 %, in wild boars from 18 to 28 kg carcass weight was 23. 1 %, subadult wild boars from 29 to 56 kg carcass weight was 33. 2 %, and the adult wild boars above 57 kg carcass weight was 41. 5 %. In addition, differences in the seroconversion of single rural districts became evident.

40|$|The ends of African <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> {{virus genome}} are formed by a 37 nucleotide-long hairpin loop composed, almost entirely, of incompletely paired A and T residues. The loops at each DNA end {{were present in}} two equimolar forms that, when {{compared}} in opposite polarities, were inverted and complementary (flip-flop), {{as in the case}} of poxvirus DNA. The hairpin loops of African <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> and vaccinia virus DNAa had no homology, but both DNAs had a 16 nucleotide-long sequence, close to the hairpin loops, with an homology of about 80 %.
