40|$|The Information Science Experiment System (ISES) {{represents}} {{a new approach}} in applying advanced systems technology and techniques to on-board information extraction in the space environment. Basically, what is proposed is a 'black box' attached to the spacecraft data bus or local area network. To the spacecraft the 'black box' appears to be just another payload requiring power, heat rejection, interfaces, adding weight, and requiring time on the data management and communication system. In reality, the 'black box' is a programmable computational resource which eavesdrops on the data network, taking and producing selectable, real-time science data back on the network. This paper will present {{a brief overview of}} the ISES Concept and will discuss issues related to applying the ISES to the polar platform and Space Station Freedom. Critical to the operation of ISES is the viability of a payload-like interface to the spacecraft data bus or local area network.

40|$|In {{the recent}} years, solar energy {{has started to}} be {{considered}} as a useful energy resource for industry. Outside of its traditional applications, domestic heating and electricity productions, there are scarce references to topics like Surface Treatment of Metals. When solar energy is adequately concentrated, a sufficient energy density is reached to affect a metal thermically, from a mere surface heating to a total fusion depending on the power and duration of the treatment. The present paper sets out the initial results of work on treatment of carbon steel carried out at the Almeria <b>Solar</b> <b>Platform.</b> The results indicate that the maximum temperature (close to 1200 ° C) is reached only a few seconds or minutes after the beginning of the test as a function of thickness and flux density. This suppose an enormous advantage over conventional thermal treatment in terms of time. Another aspect of interest is that the energy is free of charge but, on the other hand, we cannot control it as we like because we depend on weather characteristics. Maximum hardness was found on the metal surface (950 HV) with a treatment depth of between 1. 5 and 2 mm. The conclusions reached are therefore that solar energy treatment is ideal for production of structural modifications and even the formation of surface alloys. © 1991. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The {{disastrous}} {{effects of}} climate change have progressively gained interest since the 1992 Earth Summit and the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Since emissions from fossil fuel based power plants are a major contributor to anthropogenic green house gas emissions, an important means of mitigation is by replacing traditional power generation with new renewable alternatives. In fact, there are claims {{that there is a need}} to completely de-carbonize all global electricity generation by 2050 to prevent increased global temperatures that would have disastrous effects. This will demand a transformation on a scale that has no precedents, and will require the participation of all nations. Solar energy has potential to be a very versatile source of energy as solar technologies present many exciting opportunities. Due to past energy crises and protests against nuclear, as well as the more recent pressures of climate change, national energy security and scarcities, solar energy technologies have emerged and gained social legitimacy. Despite their high comparative costs and current low contribution to the worlds electricity generation (< 0. 1 %), trends show substantial growth, and corresponding projections suggest that solar energy could provide as much as 25 % of the global electricity production by 2050. Cost reductions will undoubtedly be critical for this diffusion. Fundación Chile, a non-profit organization that fosters the creation of businesses and national economic growth in Chile by introducing innovations and developing human capital in key sectors, has recognized that the cost of solar energy technologies will soon become competitive and opportunities will emerge. As a result they, in partnership with other actors, have created the Atacama <b>Solar</b> <b>Platform</b> initiative, which aims to create a world-class solar cluster in the Atacama Desert.
