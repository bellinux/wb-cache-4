40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{evidence that}} the Italian public finances are sustainable, as the country meets its intertemporal budget constraint. Nevertheless, the burden of correcting budgetary disequilibria is entirely carried by changes in taxes, which can have some detrimental economic effects, rather than changes in government spending or policy mixes. Our non-linear analysis, in particular, shows that taxes adjust more rapidly when deviations from the equilibrium level get larger, {{and that they are}} downward inflexible not only with respect to their long-run level, but also during periods of decreasing economic growth.

40|$|Economic {{and social}} {{cohesion}} between the EU Member States {{is one of}} the explicitly stated goals in the Treaty on European Union. The EU’s Structural Funds {{as a part of the}} Union’s regional policies are a mechanism of conditional grants that provides co-financing for growth enhancing investments. Evidence on the effectiveness of the Structural Funds is mixed. While Boldrin and Canova (2001) find no sign of a catch-up effect of regions receiving aid for the period of 1980 - 1996, Beugelsdijk and Eijffinger (2005) find a positive relationship between (lagged) <b>Structural</b> Funds <b>expenditure</b> and GDP growth at the national level covering 1995 - 2001. De La Fuente (2002) points to the fact that the inclusion of conditioning variables might also play a crucial role for the results. Ederveen, deGroot and Nahuis (2002) find that Structural Funds themselves have a negative impact on growth. However, the impact turns out to be significantly positive, when interacting variables measuring institutional quality are taken into account. Similarly, Esposti (2005) shows that additional policy measures (spending on CAP) can have significant counter-effects on the effectiveness of <b>Structural</b> Funds <b>expenditure.</b> So far the federal structure of the EU Member States did not attract much attention when the effectiveness of the Structural Funds is considered. Although the EU Commission requires the inclusion of regional authorities and stakeholders in the planning and implementation procedure of programs funded by Structural Funds, one should expect that the performance is better, where the sub-national authorities are more accustomed to pursuing economic policy and implementing programs. This should be the case in states with a higher degree of sub-national autonomy. Using panel-data for a sample of 13 EU Member States from 1960 - 1995 the effects of Structural Funds on growth are analysed. Then a decentralization index by Stegarescu (2004) is introduced as an interacting variable in order to measure the degree of sub-national autonomy. This paper shows that increasing sub-national autonomy has a significantly positive impact on the effectiveness of the Union’s <b>Structural</b> Funds <b>expenditure.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} twenty years, the {{introduction}} of the principle of subsidiarity and the identification of regions as political entities for the coordination of <b>structural</b> <b>expenditure</b> at the local level have led to the adoption of the principle of multi-level governance (MLG), on which principle EU government action is still based. The principle is based on the notion that the spread of governing practices (governance) across various institutions, and hence jurisdictions, results in a greater efficiency of allocation and an improved regulatory capacity compared to what more centralized governmental models are capable of yelding. According to this view, multi-level forms of government are better able to identify the effects of external economies which arise from the supply of public goods at different territorial levels. In other words, a multi-level governmental model enables, more so than other models, these external economies to be internalized and, at the same time, complex and heterogeneous demand from the local populations to be met through territorial intervention policies. Within this framework we will describe the multi level governance (MLG) model adopted from all the Countries of the EU, which constitutes the basis for national and local Public Administrations actions in the field of the social and economic development policy addressed to the disadvantaged areas of the Communitarian territory. We will present: a theoretical description of the model MLG in its different categories; the category adopted as a target by the EU with its specific characteristics, and the way those characteristics determine, in terms of operating consequences, the definition of objectives, responsibilities and roles.

40|$|The {{debate over}} the EU budget 2007 - 2013 made clear the need of an {{in-depth}} understanding {{of the distribution of}} the EU development funds. The scarce resources available need to be targeted more effectively towards the real needs of EU countries and regions in order to deliver the expected benefits. The literature on the impact of structural funds expenditure on regional growth and cohesion highlighted the reduced long-term impact of structural funds expenditure. One of the reasons for such result was identified in the biased allocation of funds among the different development axes. In this paper we assume a different perspective and focus the spatial structure of the expenditure for the Eu development policies under the 2000 - 2006 budget. For this purpose we collect a specific dataset for the EU- 15 regions, including not only structural funds (as in the existing literature) but also rural development funds under the CAP. This extended dataset allows us to assess the spatial structure of a significant percentage of the total funds targeted towards regional development. On the basis such dataset we are able: a) to analyse the spatial concentration of <b>structural</b> <b>expenditure</b> as an important prerequisite for its effectiveness. A low degree of spatial concentration of the funds may support the hypothesis of a distribution based on political equilibrium rather than effectiveness. In addition {{we will be able to}} test the spatial association of rural and regional development funds which are rarely analysed jointly thus shedding some light on the spatial coherence of the expenditure for different policies; b) to compare the spatial concentration of EU funds with a specifically developed indicator of socio-economic disadvantage of the EU regions. This analysis will allow us to analyse the coherence of the EU regional policies with regard to the structural disadvantage of EU regions thus uncovering a potential inconsistency between policy objectives (favouring disadvantaged areas) and the beneficiaries of the funds. The paper shows that although there a certain degree of spatial association between structural and rural development expenditure the factors of socio-economic disadvantage are more spatially concentrated than the funds aimed at addressing such disadvantage. ...|$|E
40|$|After {{summarising}} briefly {{the national}} development gap of the CEECs {{relative to the}} EU (section 2), a more comprehensive view is taken on the CEECs' regions (section 3). Section 4 presents some theoretical considerations on whether priority {{should be given to}} national or to regional development policy. Section 5 discusses several implications for EU structural assistance. Section 6 summarises and concludes. II/ 039 / 97 -ENSummary and conclusions The gap of national development compared to the EU 15 average income as measured by income per capita in 1993 was considerable, the 10 associated CEECs' average being at 29 % of EU 15 average. Regional policies and the regions in CEECs are characterised by a missing level of regional administration and statistics. Regional policy in the socialist era was essentially the outcome of national sectoral plans and can broadly be categorised into two country groups: A first group of countries, including Bulgaria, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary and Poland, did not undertake major efforts to reduce inter-regional disparities and allocated industries - although with several exceptions - according to traditional locations. A second group of countries, among which Czechoslovakia, Romania and Slovenia, tried to allocate industries to all regions of the country, in this way creating intra-regional differences and locations that have problems to survive in a competitive environment. Although economic transition caused polarisation effects, an implemented regional policy can hardly be found in any of these countries due to disputes over ministerial responsibilities, the need to reform territorial administrative structures and the lack of financial resources. A major regional orientation can only be found in some countries with active labour market policies for problem regions {{as well as in the}} context of programmes on cross-border co-operation. Describing regional disparities in the CEECs during the transformation process is limited by insufficient regional data. Unemployment rates in Romania and the Czech Republic vary only little across the regions, while there are major differences within Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Albania. Classifying the regions in the four Visegrad countries according to sectoral employment shares in 1991 above the national average suggests a typology of regions as mono-structural problem regions, lagging regions with a development potential and growth poles. This typology of regions is essentially in line with the ones frequently applied in western countries and gives a first idea of the future objectives of regional policies in the CEECs: diversification of the economic structure in mono-structural problem regions, development of the locational advantages in regions with a development potential and removal of bottlenecks in the growth poles. Given the financial constraints of implementing EU structural assistance in CEECs, one of the most crucial decisions will be on the regional allocation of funds, in particular whether to promote primarily national or regional development because a trade-off between national and regional development policy could force governments to decide whether to prioritise either national development or regional equality. The institutional setting in the CEECs' regions, i. e. the lack of regional administration and statistics, as well as subsidiarity considerations suggest not to have structural assistance carried out directly on a regional level. Implications for EU structural assistance bringing together PHARE and Structural Funds assistance were discussed following the four operating principles that were introduced for the reform of the Structural Funds in 1988 : concentration, partnership, programming and additionality. In respect to concentration, no new objective for countries in economic transformation should be introduced because the differences in regional problems are of a quantitative dimension rather than of a qualitative one. The basic problem in applying the principle of partnership would be a lack of administrative and social partners at the regional level, but could be an important leverage for democratisation and institution-building at the national level. While programming should in general be no problem at the national level, there might be insufficient information to programme the regional allocation of funds. In the course of enlargement, an option for reform could be to give Member States access either to a Cohesion Fund-like scheme or to a Structural Funds-like scheme in order to allow for a better targeting of projects and instruments. The Cohesion Fund-like scheme would provide for the real convergence of poorer Member States towards the Union, based on a national development programme, while the Structural Funds-like scheme would provide for social and regional cohesion in the wealthier Member States. There might be some specific problems for CEECs to comply with the additionality principle and to avoid excessive deficits at the same time. The main reason is that the budgets of the CEECs still face some risks for revenues and expenditures. Therefore, maintaining <b>structural</b> <b>expenditure</b> at a stable level without allowing for temporary public deficits will be difficult for CEECs. To sum up, several arguments suggest not to target EU structural assistance exclusively at the reduction of regional disparities within CEECs. Doing so would not only face problems due to missing administrations and statistics at the regional level, but might also be at the expense of national economic growth and extend the process of catching-up. A Cohesion Fund-like scheme could be developed into an adequate instrument for assisting the real convergence of cohesion countries towards the Union. central europe, eastern europe, economic analysis, eu funds...|$|E

40|$|Public {{investments}} in innovation and research assets have been recently perceived by policy makers {{as an effective}} tool {{for the development of}} less developed regions. This has been particularly true {{in the case of the}} European cohesion policies and the <b>structural</b> funds <b>expenditures.</b> However, the expectations have not always been matched by effective results. This article will examine the problem in three main sections. In the first we will review the debate about whether regional imbalances can be corrected by market forces and what is, eventually, the role that regional innovation strategies can play within cohesion programmes. In the second we will discuss the so called ‘regional innovation paradox’ and the problems of designing and implementing strategies within less developed regions. In the third we will identify 10 criteria that programme managers at EU, national and regional levels should consider as they try to solve those problems. cohesion policies; Europe; innovation; public {{investments in}} R&D; R&D; regional development; regional innovation strategies; structural funds...|$|R

First, the socio-economic profile of the area is presented, followed by {{a detailed description of}} structural policy intervention in the study area during 1989 - 93 period (first Community Support Framework). Subsequently, a regional Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) is used to portray the structural characteristics of the local economy, followed by the estimation of the economic impacts of policy expenditures during the first period of structural funding after the 1988 reforms. Results indicate that the local economy is characterised by a low level of development, lack of integration and generally traditional structures. Moreover, the economic impacts of <b>structural</b> policy <b>expenditure</b> were found to be very significant, especially in terms of employment and firm income generation, representing thus, a valuable effort for the promotion of the area's development.

The spatial Chow-Lin procedure, a method constructed by the authors, was used to construct on a NUTS- 2 level a complete regional data for exports, imports and FDI inward stocks, which serve as indicators for the in uence of globalization, integration and technology transfers on European regions. The results suggest that most regions have significantly benefited from globalization measured by increasing trade openness and FDI. In a non-linear growth convergence model the growth elasticities for globalization and technology transfers decrease with increasing GDP per capita. Furthermore, the estimated elasticity for FDI decreases when the model includes a higher human capital premium for CEE countries and a small significant growth enhancing effect accrues from the <b>structural</b> funds <b>expenditures</b> in the EU.

The puzzling result motivates this simple dynamic quantitative general equilibrium model to study the relationships between health status, medical expenditure and employment. The structural parameters are estimated by an indirect inference procedure. This paper finds that the simulated coefficient of medical expenditure in the health equation is negative even though in the health evolution equation of the <b>structural</b> model, medical <b>expenditure</b> only impacts the health in the positive waymedical expenditure, employment, dynamics, indirect inference...|$|R

However, {{the conclusion of the}} Cold War suggests that over the long run these dimensions are not constant; indeed, the development of economic power, state level limits on defence <b>expenditures,</b> <b>structural</b> impediments to economic change, and several other 'constants' clearly do have an endogenous role in international conflict. This paper suggests one strategy for their inclusion as a causal factor in conflict modelling. Conflict, balance of power, economic and political uncertainty,...|$|R

Based on existing literature on the relation between R & D <b>expenditures,</b> <b>structural</b> change and productivity, we evaluate the contribution of R & D and hightech industries to productivity over the last 30 years. Our results confirm the importance of business R & D in the medium to high-tech sectors and of public R & D, as they stimulate productivity growth. However, we cannot support the hypothosis that productivity growth was primarily rooted in the development of medium-high technology industries...|$|R
30|$|A {{prominent}} {{example of}} place-based policies {{is given by}} the European Union (EU) Structural Funds (European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, and European Social Fund, ESF), which target disadvantaged areas and use a significant fraction (278 billion, 28 %, in the programing period 2007 – 2013) of the EU budget. <b>Expenditures</b> under the <b>Structural</b> Funds include both investments (transport or telecommunications infrastructures, outlays for innovation, energy, the environment) and labor market programs (aimed at reducing unemployment and increasing human capital and social integration). The bulk of <b>Structural</b> Funds <b>expenditure</b> flows to Objective “Convergence” (former Objective 1) areas, which are EU regions with GDP per capita less than 75 % of the EU average. The aim of the Structural Funds is to increase long-term growth in lagging regions and make it sustainable. Since 2008, however, the EU Commission encouraged using the funds to offset {{the negative consequences of}} the economic crisis, through an acceleration of the execution of the programs, originally planned over a 7 -year horizon, and a re-orientation of the financing towards counter-cyclical interventions (European Commission 2008 a, b).|$|R
