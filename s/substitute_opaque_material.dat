50|$|By using {{completely}} <b>opaque</b> <b>material</b> {{as a cover}} {{over the}} preferred area for dodging or burning, absolutely no light will pass through and as a result, an outline of the material may be visible on the print. One way to prevent obvious cover-up lines is to slightly shake the burning material over the covered area while it is being exposed. Another way to prevent obvious cover-up lines is to use slightly less <b>opaque</b> <b>material</b> closer to the outline to produce a more subtle, faded effect.|$|R
40|$|Capsular block {{syndrome}} (CBS) {{has been}} known to occur as a rare complication of cataract surgery with continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis and a posterior-chamber lens implant. Typically, it presents with reduced vision in the early postoperative period and is characterised by a forward displacement of the posterior-chamber intra-ocular lens and an accumulation of intra-capsular <b>opaque</b> <b>material.</b> Management of CBS is usually by Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy. In this report, we describe a unique case of very-delayed-onset CBS with good visual acuity, occurring 8 years after surgery.

2500|$|Initially, these {{materials}} were only demonstrated at wavelengths longer {{than those in}} the visible spectrum. In addition, early NIMs were fabricated from <b>opaque</b> <b>materials</b> and usually made of non-magnetic constituents. As an illustration, however, if {{these materials}} are constructed at visible frequencies, and a flashlight is shone onto the resulting NIM slab, the material should focus the light at a point on the other side. This is not possible with a sheet of ordinary <b>opaque</b> <b>material.</b> In 2007, the NIST in collaboration with the Atwater Lab at Caltech created the first NIM active at optical frequencies. More recently (...) , layered [...] "fishnet" [...] NIM materials made of silicon and silver wires have been integrated into optical fibers to create active optical elements.|$|R
30|$|Another {{important}} quantity for thermographic techniques is the transmittance of a material.

40|$|Microtubules {{have been}} {{classified}} as either stable or labile, {{according to their}} resistance towards depolymerizing agents. The highest stability belongs to those organized in composite structures, in which many other proteins {{are associated with the}} tubulin. Among these microtubular systems, the marginal band of amphibian erythrocytes is unusually stable. This system can be readily isolated from Triturus red blood cells, and therefore lends itself very readily to ultrastructural and biochemical analyses. Immunofluorescence and electrophoretic analyses of the isolated bands reveal 14 components, among which tubulin, actin, myosin and a 90 K glycoprotein were identified. Tannic acid-glutaraldehyde fixation reveals a conspicuous <b>opaque</b> <b>material</b> surrounding the microtubules. Cationized ferritin binding suggests the presence of anionic sites.

5000|$|Kirchhoff's law {{of thermal}} {{radiation}} states that absorption equals emissivity opaque for every specific wavelength/frequency (materials often have quite different emissivities at different wavelengths). Therefore, if asphalt has an emissivity value of 0.90 {{at a specific}} wavelength (say wavelength of 10 micrometer, or room temperature thermal radiation), its thermal absorptance value would also be 0.90. This means that it absorbs and emits 90 percent of radiant thermal energy. As it is an <b>opaque</b> <b>material,</b> the remaining 10 percent must be reflected. Conversely, a low-e material such as aluminum foil has a thermal emissivity/absorptance value of 0.03 and as an <b>opaque</b> <b>material</b> the thermal reflectance value must be 1.0 - 0.03 =0.97, meaning it reflects 97 percent of radiant thermal energy. Low-emissivity building materials include window glass manufactured with metal-oxide coatings as well as housewrap materials, reflective thermal insulations {{and other forms of}} radiant thermal barriers. The thermal emissivity of various surfaces is listed in the following table.|$|R
40|$|Although the thrombogenic {{nature of}} the {{surfaces}} of cardiovascular devices is {{an important aspect of}} blood biocompatibility, few studies have examined platelet deposition onto <b>opaque</b> <b>materials</b> used for these devices in real time. This is particularly true for the metallic surfaces used in current ventricular assist devices (VADs). Using hemoglobin depleted red blood cells (RBC ghosts) and long working distance optics to visualize platelet deposition, we sought to perform such an evaluation. A titanium alloy (Ti 6 Al 4 V) and 5 alternative <b>opaque</b> <b>materials</b> were examined. Ti 6 Al 4 V had significantly increased platelet deposition relative to the majority of alternative materials. Blood flow patterns are of particular concern for devices such as blood pumps where shearing forces can be high, volumes are relatively large, and the flow fields can be complex. However, few studies have examined the effect of geometric irregularities on thrombus formation on clinically relevant <b>opaque</b> <b>materials</b> under flow. The second objective of this report was to quantify human platelet deposition onto titanium alloys, as well as positive and negative control surfaces, in the region of crevices (50 - 150 µm in width) that might be encountered in many VADs. The results revealed that the largest crevice size was the least thrombogenic. At the higher shear rate, the most deposition occurred in the medium size crevice. A third challenge in assessing the hemocompatibility of a blood-wetted device is understanding the functional relationship between shear stress, biochemical agonists, and artificial surfaces. The final objective of this report was to investigate the effect of sub-threshold concentrations of ADP in conjunction with flow on platelet deposition onto clinically relevant <b>opaque</b> <b>materials.</b> To achieve this aim, a membrane-based agonist delivery system was designed to evenly introduce specific concentrations of agonists into a flowing blood analog. The results showed that that the addition of a sub-threshold level of ADP to the system resulted in nearly a 2. 5 fold increase in deposition on the titanium surface. The data generated from this report could be used to improve the accuracy of a predictive model of thrombotic deposition in VADs...|$|R
