5|$|<b>Silicon</b> <b>carbide</b> (SiC), {{also known}} as {{carborundum}} , is a semiconductor containing silicon and carbon with chemical formula SiC.

All the calculated mechanical constants like bulk, shear and Young's modulus are in good agreement with experimental values. Both compounds show distinct anisotropic elastic properties along different crystalline directions, and the intrinsic brittleness of both compounds is also confirmed. The elastic anisotropy of both aluminum <b>silicon</b> <b>carbides</b> originates from their bonding structures. The calculated band gap is obtained as 1. 12 and 1. 04 eV for Al 4 SiC 4 and Al 4 Si 2 C 5 respectively. From the total electron density distribution map, the obvious covalent bonds exist between Al and C atoms. A distinct electron density deficiency sits between AlC bond along c axis among Al 4 SiC 4, which leads to its limited tensile strength.
