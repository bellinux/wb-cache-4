5|$|<b>Silicon</b> <b>carbide</b> (SiC), {{also known}} as {{carborundum}} , is a semiconductor containing silicon and carbon with chemical formula SiC. It occurs in nature as the extremely rare mineral moissanite. Synthetic <b>silicon</b> <b>carbide</b> powder has been mass-produced since 1893 for use as an abrasive. Grains of <b>silicon</b> <b>carbide</b> can be bonded together by sintering to form very hard ceramics that are widely used in applications requiring high endurance, such as car brakes, car clutches and ceramic plates in bulletproof vests.

All the calculated mechanical constants like bulk, shear and Young's modulus are in good agreement with experimental values. Both compounds show distinct anisotropic elastic properties along different crystalline directions, and the intrinsic brittleness of both compounds is also confirmed. The elastic anisotropy of both aluminum <b>silicon</b> <b>carbides</b> originates from their bonding structures. The calculated band gap is obtained as 1. 12 and 1. 04 eV for Al 4 SiC 4 and Al 4 Si 2 C 5 respectively. From the total electron density distribution map, the obvious covalent bonds exist between Al and C atoms. A distinct electron density deficiency sits between AlC bond along c axis among Al 4 SiC 4, which leads to its limited tensile strength.
