The Belgian Constitutional Court made two judgments about it. Furthermore, numerous parliamentary bills were proposed in the Senate and the House of Representatives in relation with its provisions.

30|$|The {{aspiration}} of {{a closer}} liaison between {{social sciences and}} futures studies is far from novel. Eleonora Masini [53] saw futurists as society builders and valued articulators rather than observers, an emphasis that focuses on searching for and interpreting the <b>seed</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> based {{on the history of}} a society. More recently, Masini [54] cites the futures-oriented perspective as a prerequisite for interdisciplinary analysis empowerment in social sciences with reference to decision making at local, national, and international levels. Masini points out that both social sciences and futures studies need each other to cope with rapid change. Karlsen, Øverland and Karlsen [55] suggest theoretical assumptions embedded in sociology (such as complexity, anticipation, and change) can clarify and strengthen the theory of future studies. The theory of futures research and the practice of foresight could be solidified if their key concepts were explicated.|$|R

50|$|Many {{individuals}} and organizations argued that the settlement in the consent decree should have included broader relief. However, the judge said {{that was not the}} test; the test is whether settlement is fair and reasonable compared to cost of trial. The judge found that the two tracks would ensure prompt distribution, while a trial would have been complicated, long, and costly. Also, the judge appointed a monitor to track and report on enforcement and court retained jurisdiction. Notably, the USDA would not include a provision that they would prevent future discrimination. The court concluded the Consent Decree represented a significant first step away from historical discrimination.

The models are early-stage but have started generating product and business-model innovations, planting <b>seeds</b> <b>of</b> cultural <b>change</b> in the parent firms, and building external ecosystems with partners that range from startup companies to individual developers and makers.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Many {{organisational}} gurus {{highlight the}} value of oral narrative or storytelling {{as a catalyst for}} organisational change or a way to share knowledge. Tomes of articles describe seasoned raconteurs single handedly inciting enormous transformation in organisations. Oxymoronically many written works are describing the power of oral narrative. Surely these printed exposés are themselves motivators for change; so why the continued emphasis on the face-to-face storytelling? There is no disputing the fact that oral narrative is a powerful form of communicating; however, it is not always feasible. In fact, there are times when the written word packs a more powerful punch. Often it is simply not possible to catch the ear of a wide audience simultaneously, or even at all. Many people simply will not take time from their busy schedules to listen to stories. Busy executives seem to prefer the written word to the spoken. In these cases, the power of the pen offers a persuasive substitute. This is a tale about such stories in action, each of which seemed to sow the <b>seed</b> <b>of</b> <b>change.</b> <b>Of</b> course, time will be the real test; however, anecdotal evidence seems to support the proposition that well-written futuristic stories provide an excellent alternative to face-to-face oral narrative. At least in these examples, the written story proved to be a motivator for organisational change and an effective way to share knowledge. This paper is about the use of narrative to share knowledge; it is part tutorial and part theory. Building on the foundational knowledge developed by Denning, Snowden, Prusak, and others this paper describes the “how to ” of effective storytelling to create and share knowledge within organisations...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to provide the teacher who {{believes}} in students as people and people as self-directing, thinking individuals with working ideas that can be incorporated within the traditional school system, yet allow students freedom to learn. The ideas are practical because they are based upon the real experiences of teachers, students, administrators, and schools. It is also the <b>seed</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> for those to plant who recognize the desperate plight, or even failure, of the present public school system and the need for new ideas in the relatively static present condition. These ideas can work in the most traditional school even with administrators that are relatively opposed to change, but can really take root and grow where there is an increasing awareness in the school that all is not right. Most of the ideas expressed in this paper have been expressed by many others before in many different contexts. An attempt has been made to document some of the more controversial assertions made. This documentation usually in no way reflects the actual number of sources from which the idea was drawn, but rather is the source that has stated the case most succinctly or was the first expression of the idea encountered by the writer in his research. Any reader can gain a better perspective of the working validity and/or broader philosophical undergirdings of the ideas presented in this paper from further reading in the bibliography and/or appendix.
