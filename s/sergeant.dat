The <b>Sergeant</b> Major of the Marine Corps is chosen by the Commandant of the Marine Corps to serve as his adviser and is the preeminent and highest ranking enlisted Marine with a protocol equivalency of a lieutenant general.|$|E
5|$|McCulloch met former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr in 1993 {{and they}} wrote and {{recorded}} an album, tentatively titled Touch Down. The album {{was to be}} released in early 1994; however, despite McCulloch and Marr being happy with the album, Rob Dickins at WEA felt it was missing some element. Dickins suggested to McCulloch that <b>Sergeant</b> be brought in to do some work. McCulloch was initially sceptical because he had not spoken with <b>Sergeant</b> since de Freitas's funeral; however, he did give the idea some thought. Before McCulloch had chance to contact <b>Sergeant,</b> a mutual friend persuaded the pair to meet socially. While McCulloch and <b>Sergeant</b> were being reacquainted, the tapes from the McCulloch and Marr sessions disappeared. McCulloch was not upset about this as he and <b>Sergeant</b> had started working together as Electrafixion.|$|E
