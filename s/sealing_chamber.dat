The rocks around the cross {{point of the}} {{auxiliary shaft}} and the underground station, are clay-stone and siltstone intermingled with layers of thin coal seam. There exist a few of small faults nearby, and the rocks belong to the typical broken type. Based on thoroughly geomechanics tests around the group of chambers, the spatial characteristics and law of the stress distribution around the chambers were studied, the characteristics of chamber deformation and damage were also researched. Finally, a reinforcement pattern for the group of chambers was proposed: firstly, high pressure grouting with deep boreholes; then rock bolting with extra high strength bolts and cables; finally, <b>sealing</b> <b>chamber</b> surface with shotcreting (Kang et al. 2011 c).|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The {{purpose of}} this work is fast design {{optimization}} of the <b>seal</b> <b>chamber.</b> The study includes the mass transfer between lower and upper <b>chamber</b> on <b>seal</b> <b>chamber</b> for hot water application pumps. The use of Fluent 12. 1 commercial code {{made it possible to}} capture complex flow with heat-mass transfer, radiation, Tailor instability, and buoyancy effect. Realizable k-epsilon model was used for turbulence modeling. Radiation heat losses were taken into account. The temperature distribution at seal region is predicted with respect to heat addition. Results show the possibilities of the model simplifications by excluding the water domain in low chamber from calculations. CFD simulations permit to improve <b>seal</b> <b>chamber</b> design to meet target water temperature around the seal. This study can be used for the analysis of different <b>seal</b> <b>chamber</b> configurations. II.

40|$|LectureHeat soak {{is defined}} as heat {{transfer}} from the metal of a <b>seal</b> <b>chamber</b> to the fluid within the <b>seal</b> <b>chamber.</b> Many variables affect heat soak including materials, surface configurations, and film coefficients. Heat soak can be from the <b>seal</b> <b>chamber</b> to the fluid within, or from the fluid to the <b>seal</b> <b>chamber.</b> Typically, the term heat soak is used to describe heat transfer from a hot pump to a cooler liquid within the <b>seal</b> <b>chamber.</b> During {{the development of the}} API 682 seal standard (2004), the API 682 Task Force adopted an equation for estimating heat soak but recommended that the coefficients in the equation should be based on tests. However, there are still little data available and most users simply estimate heat soak using the API 682 default values. For a number of service conditions, the API 682 default equation produces unnecessarily high estimates for heat soak but default estimates are not always high. As a result, auxiliary systems can be incorrectly sized by using the API 682 default equation for heat soak. Improvements are needed in the API 682 heat soak equation. The first step toward improving the API 682 heat soak equation was to use simple one-dimensional find theory to derive a heat transfer equation. Surprisingly, this one-dimensional fin equation could be recast into a form that approximated the API equation but included additional parameters. The theoretical fin equation was checked and further improved using two-dimensional finite element analysis and again by using computational fluid dynamics. The predicted heat transfer compares favorably to measurements in the test lab. Based on these studies, the authors have prepared and offer a table of adjustment factors to be applied to the default API 682 heat soak equation...|$|R
