The <b>quenching</b> of uranyl <b>luminescence</b> is observed. The graphs giving U(VI) luminescence intensity, {{as a function}} of dissociated and non-dissociated acetic acid form concentrations are constructed at the different pH values to point out the interacting ligand species. Acetate ions are demonstrated to be responsible for the <b>luminescence</b> <b>quenching.</b> <b>Stern–Volmer</b> <b>analysis</b> gives the dynamic quenching rate constant value (kq) (1. 0 ± 0. 2) × 109 L M− 1 s− 1 at ionic strength (μ) 0. 05 M (pH 2. 0). The bimolecular excited-state process is shown to be diffusion-controlled as kq is practically identical to the diffusion rate constant as calculated for uranyl and acetate species. With an increase of acetate concentration (from 1 × 10 − 4 M), static quenching occurs in addition to the dynamic quenching. The formation of a non-luminescent complex between uranyl and acetate is supported (with 1 : 1 stochiometry). The stability constant values for the first complex species (UO 2 CH 3 COO+) are obtained at different ionic strengths. Extrapolation to μ = 0 by the specific ion interaction theory (SIT) gives log β 1 ° = 2. 95 ± 0. 08 at 293 K. From 1. 5 × 10 − 3 M of acetate concentration, the decay curves became biexponential and shorter lifetime appears. The U(VI) luminescence intensity is not decreased anymore and the bathochromic shift of peak maxima is observed. Most probably, this indicates the formation of the second complex species of U(VI) with two acetate ligands. These species give luminescence emission...|$|R

The Cuan group developed a dual-functional platform for the detection and removal of TC with a highly stable luminescent zirconium-based MOF (PCN- 128 Y) [66].

The strong metal–ligand bonding between Zr 6 nodes and TC through solvent-assisted ligand incorporation was suggested to mainly account for the high adsorption capability of PCN- 128 Y toward TC in water.

40|$|The local {{coordination}} around luminescent ions in phosphors {{can affect}} the properties of these materials. In this report, we analyze the Ce 3 + luminescence for the various Ce 3 + centers in Sr 3 AlO 4 F-based phosphors and use the excitation, emission, and quenching of these phosphors to infer aspects of the local coordination. It is shown that Ce 3 + centers with lower energy 4 f 1 → 5 d 1 absorption bands are likely from charge compensation effects by the replacement of F − by O 2 −. In addition, at higher RE 3 + concentrations, additional Ce 3 + centers with even lower energy 4 f 1 → 5 d 1 absorption bands are present, presumably due to Ce 3 +-RE 3 + pair formation and O 2 − charge compensation. These Ce 3 + centers with lower energy 4 f 1 → 5 d 1 absorption bands have their <b>luminescence</b> strongly <b>quenched</b> at room temperature.

Our analysis is based on an extension of the random-deposition model, previously developed for the “one-dimensional” case of DNA. Our goal is to deduce the interaction distance (L) characteristic of the photoelectron transfer in the quenching process. The statistical analysis yields the surprising result that the electron donor and acceptor metal complexes do not bind randomly on the SBD’s surfaces but that they tend to be found next to one another. The energy of attraction, 2. 9 kBT, is nearly equal for all four generations of dendrimers tested. We argue that the attraction stems from hydrophobic interactions.

For a wide range of Ce concentrations (between 0. 033 % and 3. 3 %) the temperature dependence of the emission intensity and the luminescence lifetimes are reported. The intrinsic quenching temperature of the Ce luminescence is shown to be very high (> 700 K). The lower quenching temperatures reported in the literature are explained by thermally activated concentration quenching (for highly doped systems) and the temperature dependence of the oscillator strength (for low doping concentrations). In addition, high-resolution spectra are reported, which provide insight into the position of the zero-phonon transition (20450 cm- 1), the Stokes shift (2400 cm- 1), the energy of the dominant phonon mode (200 cm- 1), and the Huang-Rhys parameter (S) 6).

In general, the photophysical properties of the magnetic-core dye-doped silica nanoparticles, SNPdye, where dye is one of the seven dyes studied in this project, are dictated by homogeneous energy transfer between dye molecules and by dye aggregation. Molecules with a small Stokes shift and affinity for aggregation upon silica encapsulation (TMR and Bodipy derivatives) can be only sparsely loaded (< 502 ̆ 01360 molecules per a 60 nm in diameter nanoparticle) into the nanoparticle matrix before strong fluorescence quenching takes effect. These dyes yield the least bright nanoparticles whose luminosity strongly decreases as the intraparticle dye concentration increases above the rather low maximum brightness loading. Other common fluorophores (Alexa Fluor 546 and fluorescein) can be loaded into the silica matrix with little to no fluorescence quenching until the intermolecular separation becomes less than 5 nm (1002 ̆ 013200 fluorophores per a 60 nm in diameter nanoparticle).
