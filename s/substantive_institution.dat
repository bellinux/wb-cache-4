I argue that the Aoki model can be grounded in theories of distributed cognition and performativity, which I put into the context of Searle's philosophical account of <b>institutions.</b> <b>Substantive</b> <b>institutions</b> build on regularized causal interactions between internal neuronal mechanisms and external facts, which are shared in a population of agents. Following Searle's proposal to conceive rule following as a neuronally anchored behavioral disposition, I show that his corresponding notion of collective intentionality can be grounded in recent neuroscience theories about imitation as the primordial process in human learning. I relate this with Searle's concept of status function and the neuronal theory of metaphors, resulting in a precise definition of rule-following as performative action. I present two empirical examples, the institution of money and status hierarchies in markets.

Radical lifestyle changes have also occurred in the past two to three decades. The result of such shifts is a new global order so dissimilar to the previous one that we are unable to imagine life as it was a few short decades before. 1 If scholars are to be trusted, the convergence of the next world shaking historical change will occur sometime between 2010 and 2020, not far from now.

40|$|Combining {{different}} {{new approaches}} to human behavior in neuroeconomics, the cognitive sciences and institutional economics, this paper sketches the fundamentals of a naturalistic theory of economic order. In this endeavour, the argument follows the track laid down by Hayek's comprehensive thinking about institutions and the economy, but provides new and more detailed causal accounts of the central mechanisms that link institutions and neurocognitive patterns. Based on an analytical framework to <b>substantive</b> <b>institutions</b> that has been recently proposed by Aoki, I present Hayek's theory of culture in terms of modern conceptions of performativity and distributed cognition. As a result, I introduce the concept of institutionally guided behavioral patterns, which is a modern restatement of concepts such as Veblen's habits of thought. This approach is applied on the institution of money, analyzing its emergence as a cognitive novelty that activates universal neuronal embodiments of the human penchant for social exchange and reciprocity. Against this background I argue that the naturalistic approach to economic order favours a perspective on economic policy that emphasizes cultural aspects, in particular, the formation of individual identities in different societal groups that create ethical commitments. Again, this argument is based on recent insights of the brain sciences and intends to offer {{an alternative to the}} recent proposals of a Libertarian Paternalism that have also taken insights from behavioral economics and neuroeconomics as a starting point. I show that my line of thinking {{can be traced back to}} Adam Smith, as far as the conjunction of his views in the Theory of Moral Sentiment and the Wealth of Nations is concerned.

40|$|UnrestrictedThis three-part study generates {{practical}} and theoretical insights for researchers of institutional change and practitioners of institutional reforms. The increased {{recognition of the}} importance of effective public sector institutions in international development necessitates this inquiry, especially given the poor track record of donor- promoted reforms.; The first part of the study traces knowledge and ideas that have informed leading donors’ reform efforts and their outcomes. To this end, the study identifies and examines three waves of donor-promoted public sector reforms in developing countries for the last five decades. A deficiency in practical knowledge on institutional change was identified which manifests itself in the disconnect between international development practice and the broader pool of knowledge from different disciplines. In this context, leading donors’ reforms are informed by several unsupported assumptions on institutional change.; The second part of this study maps and examines how such donor-promoted reforms have played on the ground, using the case of Kyrgyzstan’s reforms over the past twenty years. It was found that the reforms, when designed and promoted without comprehensive understanding of institutions and institutional change, may be harmful to recipient countries when conducted by poorly accountable officials in nontransparent environments.; The third part of the study addresses the deficiency in practical knowledge by integrating key insights on institutional change scholarship from several disciplines, including law, psychology, organizational development, sociology, economics, political science, and public administration. A new set of analytical tools and propositions are developed and applied to analyze key problems in public sector institutions and reforms to generate practical inferences. Key among the propositions is that the enforceability of government-made rules is primarily a function of the alignment of rules with norms and mental models of the individuals in that setting. This alignment is more important than a government’s enforcement capacity, especially in developing countries where such capacity is often limited. Donors’ current approaches to promoting reforms, which tend to prescribe formal institutional models from elsewhere, may deepen misalignment between rules and norms, making enforceability of institutions even more problematic. One way of increasing such alignment would be to focus on helping recipient countries to reform their procedural institutions, such as participatory policymaking institutions, instead of attempting to design <b>substantive</b> <b>institutions</b> for them.; The study’s findings and theoretical tools and propositions apply to diverse settings ranging from development to nation-building to organizational change...|$|R

At the same time, we found that a significant minority of trained ULRs were not active in union learning. While ULR activity was not confined within traditionally unionised settings, active and effective ULRs were most likely to be found in workplaces with <b>substantive</b> structures and <b>institutions</b> that underpinned union learning and reflected a clear commitment from the employer.

Orenstein, Alon Tal and Char Miller, is {{deposited}} here {{by permission of}} the University of Pittsburgh Press. © 2013. All rights reserved. Militaristic societies are ones in which the armed forces enjoy a privileged material and cultural status, and where military priorities and frames of thinking {{play a key role in}} policymaking and political culture (Vagts 1981, Evans and Newnham 1988). Militarism is not limited to direct governance by uniformed personnel (“praetorianism”), but may instead coexist with <b>substantive</b> democratic <b>institutions</b> (Ben Eliezer 1997). Thus, contemporary societies described as militaristic are as politically diverse as Switzerland and Burma, North and South Korea, Jordan and Israel. This chapter explores the interface between environmental and military issues in Israel, placing it within the context of the changing fortunes of Israeli militarism. In particular, it is argued that growing public willingness to challenge the military’s environmentally destructive behavior in the last decades was linked to wider transformations in Israeli society. The Oslo Accords and the rise of liberalindividualist outlooks associated with globalization and consumer culture weakened the country’s founding collectivist ideology in favor of material values associated with quality of life. In this context, the military lost its previous immunity to public criticism, and environmental concerns, formerly considered luxuries in comparison with security matters, were able to gain ground in the public sphere alongside other civil agendas. The chapter begins by stating the case for viewing Israel as a militaristic society. It then surveys the military’s environmental activity and the environmental destruction it has wrought, while also noting some early successes in the area of nature conservation. Finally, it discusses how, since the 1990 s, the environmental movement and affected residents, as well as the Ministry of Environment and State Comptroller, have pushed the military to clean up its act...|$|R
40|$|Crucial {{social and}} {{cultural}} elements underpin state institutions and ensure that they function. This is true in any context, but {{it is even more}} important to understand and truly acknowledge in fragile ones. Conventional perspectives need to be broadened and {{need to look at the}} multiplicity and diversity of political institutions (formal and in-formal), cultures and logics through which state resilience and state-building processes may be supported. Such an approach would help re-integrate the intangible dimensions that constitute the <b>substantive</b> content of <b>institutions,</b> their ethos, beyond their mere forms. Based upon concrete experiences in different African countries, this paper explains what these intangible dimensions are in three of the sectors usually concerned with reforms (politics, justice and security), and why they are important and should be better integrated in analyses, intervention strategies and aid programmes. An equally important dimension of such integration is that it would also allow better consideration of local capacities and resources to be taken, in particular in terms of resilience, and would allow it to go beyond the impression of vacuum or chaos too often given to situations of fragility. Finally, the paper presents some concrete recommendations to integrate these dimensions better into the priorities and modalities of European aid, as well as suggest a few avenues for further research on the subject. state building; institutions...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent decades}} the European Union {{has moved from}} a {{multilateral}} treaty to a distinctive social, political, and economic order among European states. During the same period political philosophers have increasingly {{turned their attention to}} questions of justice beyond the state. But their discussions have largely focused on global justice, and have paid relatively little attention to the distinctive moral and political questions raised by {{the emergence of a new}} type of order among European states. This thesis fills this lacuna, by developing a conception of ‘social democratic’ or ‘egalitarian’ social justice for the specific institutional arrangements of the EU. In Chapters one through three, I delineate a general conception of ‘pluralist egalitarianism’, the view that we have a variety of grounds for endorsing equality-inclined economic institutions domestically. Direct egalitarian arguments stress the internal requirements of institutional fairness to which basic economic institutions are subject. Indirect egalitarian arguments favour egalitarian economic outcomes based on concerns of social equality. I further differentiate between a transnationalist and an internationalist position. Direct transnationalist arguments stress the EU’s similarity to domestic institutions and derive egalitarian economic requirements for the EU as a whole. Indirect transnationalists argue that EU citizens stand in a distinctive kind of relationship such that the value of social equality has purchase amongst them, and social equality requires a limitation on economic inequalities at the EU level. By contrast, internationalists insist on the continuing importance of national self-determination. However, they endorse more <b>substantive</b> economic <b>institutions</b> at the EU level to protect existing social democratic welfare state arrangements. In chapter four to seven, I assess the extent to which each of these arguments can support a more egalitarian organisation of basic economic institutions at the EU level. Finally, I offer one practical proposal that would help the EU to realise the social democratic vision I have defended. This is the idea of an EU social minimum. I explain how such a social minimum would be conceived and implemented, and I demonstrate why transnationalists and internationalists should endorse such a policy.

40|$|Inaugural lecture [...] Department of Anthropology, Rand Afrikaans University, 26 August 1982 If ethnic units (or "volke") {{are to be}} {{the object}} of study or the {{starting}} point of explanation for everything else in the field of Anthropology nothing, man included, is explained. The understanding of man can fruitfully be effectuated by a study of culture defined as collective ideas (a conceptual framework) which influence and direct cultural perception, values and norms -and not by an empiricist definition of culture. The definition of culture as collective ideas facilitates the identification of the multicontextual existence of culture: a universal and particularistic context. The particularistic context, again, reflects multiple dimensions: a mental dimension (ideas); a <b>substantive</b> dimension (customs, <b>institutions,</b> material objects, etc); and an adaptive dimension (enculturation and acculturation). The comprehensive context of culture operates dialectically through its component phenomena to such an integrated extent that the theoretical exclusion of anyone context or dimension renders explanation incomplete. From the perspective developed here it is believed that the study of ethnicity becomes analitically more profound. The adaptive dimension (of the particularistic context) of culture expounds the cultural experience of individuals and the bearing this has on perception and identity. It thus also expounds the multi-faceted nature of identity and the complexity of collective alliance. The theoretical construct of the complex collective alliances of people (culturally speaking), situationally formed on one or more dimensions of identity creates a much more flexible approach to ethnicity. It provides for a continuum to be constructed on which collective entities could be ranged according to a scale depending on the degree of ethnic magnitude, approaching a 100 % measure of homogeneity, hypothetically speaking. This will alleviate the difficulties in determining ethnic boundaries. Comprehensive cultural homogeneity ("volke") is a rather rare phenomenon, whereas culture abounds in association with people. The study of homogeneous ethnic groups either as an instrumental or teleological, theoretical concern, is therefore both methodologically and practically self-defeating...|$|R

A central question afforded direction to the study: What internal and/or external mechanisms are utilized by corporations in determining disputes amongst their various constituents, and how can corporate dispute resolution strategy inform higher education policy development? ^ Data were obtained using structured interviews and elite interviews with 11 study participants selected via purposeful sampling, representing insurance/reinsurance, the Civil Service, higher education, retail, trade unionism, and the legal fraternity. In addition to the in-depth interviews, data were obtained through examination of documentary evidence, including 19 arbitral awards subject to judicial review by the Bermuda Supreme Court or by the English High Court between 1995 and 2005, to ensure triangulation of findings. ^ Inductive data analysis yielded six empirical assertions sanctioned through evidentiary warrants: (a) Commercial arbitration processes diverge from employment dispute resolution processes, (b) Procedural detail and specificity characterize the model arbitration clause, (c) Modern grievance arbitration is not unlike court litigation, (d) Systemic challenges impact the efficacy of Employment Tribunal function, (e) Privacy and confidentiality are enshrined in British arbitration, and (f) Contemporary challenges threaten the traditional arbitral construct. ^ Although developments had, to some degree, lessened the appeal of arbitration as an expeditious form of alternative dispute resolution in Bermuda, most participants evinced satisfaction with the arbitral process nevertheless.

40|$|This {{paper had}} been {{presented}} for promotion {{at the university}} of Khartoum. To get the full text please contact the other at Babiker 69 @hotmail. com•	The thesis in chapter II focuses on tribal rule in the Sudan, its philosophy and foundation. It also provides a historical exposition of five stages of native administration system. The thesis also examines the tribal system of judia (conciliation) as an important mechanism of dispute resolution. In this respect the author looks at the judia as an institution which has its own well-established traditions and procedures. The author further addresses the application of substantive customary laws by the institution of judia as an effective mechanism of conflict resolution. She argues that tribal leaders do not apply statutory laws and are not aware of its existence. They are only familiar with customary laws which are derived from their heritage and cultures. •	The author argues also that tribal rule assumes important role and is necessary in the Sudan context for many factors. One of such factors is the vast land of Sudan and its cultural diversity. Also, the lack of transportation and communication has led to the adoption of tribal rule or system as one of the ways or means of local governance. Also, subsequent governments have maintained the tribal system for economic, geographical and social factors in addition to the lack of resources to appoint huge numbers of Judges, administration personnel, security officers, clerks and accountants. •	The author has highlighted five different stages of traditional rule in Sudan: (1) before 1922 (2) between 1922 and 1937 (3) between 1937 and 1969 (4) between 1969 and 1989 (5) post 1989. During the first stage Chiefs or traditional leaders have enjoyed wide powers and applied customary laws and local traditions without relying on the formal justice system and acted independently from the central government. At that time Chiefs have only nominal connections with the central government and relations restricted only to showing obedience, payment of taxes and keeping law and order. This {{was the case in the}} kingdoms of Phonge and Fur Kingdom. The Ottoman Turkish Rule recognized this reality when ruled Sudan but tried to make a link between state organs in order to strengthen the relationship between the central government and traditional or tribal rule. In order to realize this policy, the country was divvied into several provinces, each province governed by a governor aided by officials in charge of the tribal rule system headed by Nazirs, then Sheiks Khat and Omdas at the lower end of the tribal system hierarchy. A national tribal council was also established in Medani (the capital of Sudan at the time) to seek their views on national issues. •	The author argues that the Mahadi state not only relied on the tribal system but set up its military might on the tribal basis as the army constituted on three 'tribal brigades'. Thus, at that stage that the tribal system was given full recognition and it was a necessity through which Sudan as a vast country will be governed. Furthermore, tribal native system was respected and derived from peoples' culture, customs and traditions. •	The second stage of the tribal rule was between 1922 to 1937. This is the stage when the powers of tribal leaders were regulated. Rather than making the legal system completely based on customary laws native rule was subjected to statutory laws. As a result, traditional institutions were integrated as part of the administrative system of governance in addition to introduction of modern laws. This resulted in radical change as customary laws are in conflict or not in harmony with statutory laws. For example, in 1922 the Arab Shiekhs Act was enacted to regulate the powers of judges of third instance to litigate on tribal conflicts and cases pertaining to law and order. During this period the colonial rule relied on traditional justice and tribal leaders in the 'steering judicial affairs' and native administration. •	 In 1932 a new law enacted and four types of native courts were set up in northern Sudan: (1) Sheikh court of multiple purposes; (2) Sheikhs Council; (3) village court; (4) private court. All these courts apply (in terms of substantive laws) customary law and local traditions. In 1937 Local Government Council Law was issued which allocates tribal administrative powers to tribal Chiefs (i. e. tax collection, renovation of native courts). Tribal institutions, in terms of their structure or hierarchy consist of three levels: (1) Sheikh (at the bottom of the pyramid and elected or chosen by the tribe dignitaries) (2) Omda (presides over a number of Shiekhs and nominated but not elected (3) Nazirs (at the top of the pyramid and appointed by the colonial government). •	As in the case of northern Sudan, the author argues that tribal chiefs in southern Sudan have enjoyed judicial, legislative and executive powers in accordance with customary laws and traditions. The colonial government set up four courts called 'Al-Lokikouz' in Mangala and Upper Nile Provinces in 1922. Two years later, the Chiefs Courts Act was issued and applied in all parts of southern Sudan. Three courts were established: (1) the Chief court consists of only one member (2) the Chief Court consists of other members and (3) private court. •	The third stage of tribal rule is between 1937 and 1969. This period witnessed a competition between the local government and native administration although the two systems coincided. During this stage the Local Government Act 1937 was issued and as a result local councils were established in many localities and rural areas. This development was not well received or welcomed by tribal leaders of native administration as the new Act strips them from some powers. Also, this period witnessed conflict between the native administration and members of the national legislative assembly as they call for the liquidation of native administration. The Council of Ministers also decided to cancel the jobs of Nazirs and Sheikh Khat in particular their administrative duties. Traditional tribal leaders staunchly opposed the government policies and established what is called 'Tribal Leaders Union' as a national union based in Khartoum on 19 January 1969. This period also witnessed conflicting or inconsistent policies towards native administration. In some occasions, the government dismisses judges from native administration while in other occasions establish judicial councils and gives prominence to native administration and ensures its importance. While the government is willing to modernize and energise the judicial and administrative systems it is also hesitant to abolish native administration as this may instigate anger and frustration among tribal leaders whose tribal base and support is vital to political parties during local and general elections as they have strong leverage over voters in the tribal communities. •	The fourth stage of native administration is between 1969 to 1989. The author has argued that this is the period in which native administration was completely abolished particularly in 1970. As a result, the military regime appointed and trained many administrators and created huge numbers of local councils in town and rural areas to cover the vacuum created by the absence of native administration. The abolition of native administration has serious repercussions particularly the huge increase of the cost of the judiciary and administration which makes local councils to borrow from the central government. Also, one of the advantages of native administration is its effective contribution to the maintenance of law and order with minimum cost. For example, it was regarded as a ‘costless police apparatus’ with efficiency in understanding the nature of the areas it covers as well as its ability to cover huge areas and rough terrain. As a result of the dissolution of native administration many tribal conflicts erupted, cost of security increased with huge administrative burden on the part of the government as it was involved in many tribal conferences of dispute resolution. Also, local governments failed due to lack of knowledge of customary laws and local traditions. •	The fifth stage is after 1989. During this period some efforts were made to restore the powers of native administration. A national conference for native administration was held in October 1992 which recommended the following: (1) ensure that native administration has a role in maintaining peace and security; (2) native administration has a role in development and galvanizing public opinion for the good of the society; (3) entrust native administration with police powers; (4) appoint native administration leaders in local government councils (5) establish appeal courts in the states from native administration Chiefs to judicially review decisions a the provincial level. •	The author focuses also on Al Judya tribal system as a mechanism for dispute resolution. Agaweed (including presiding Chiefs, Nazirs, Omdas, Mck, Ruth, Sultan, Arab, Arro, Al- Kashif, Al-Dimingawi, Al-Manjul, Al- Magdoum, Al Ageed) are wise people, have deep knowledge and acquainted with tribal customs and traditions, trustworthy, have good reputation, experienced in addition to their neutrality and ability to observe the vital interests of the tribe. All these qualities make tribal leaders respected and trustworthy and their decisions are binding and acceptable by the parties of the dispute as well as the tribe as a whole. •	The author further argues that the Judya institution has its own unique characteristics. It is neither a burecratic regulatory body set up in accordance with public rules and regulations nor an elected body created by special Act of Parliament. Rather, this institution is very unique in the sense that it is respected and accepted by all and its decisions are binding and can be implemented. In terms of its applicable <b>substantive</b> laws, this <b>institution</b> applies customary laws and traditions which can be applied between members of the same tribe as well as between different tribes. In terms of the Agaweed powers, they enjoy judicial powers with regard to particular disputes related to land and pasture disputes and pastoralist routes. Apart from its judicial powers, the Judya is an early warning institution which alerts governmental bodies of looming conflicts, disasters or epidemics and keep an open eye on foreign nationals who enter the country through irregular migration. The Judya institution is not a formal judicial or administrative body but participates positively with these formal institutions in resolving 85 % of tribal conflicts all of which are resolved through customary law which cannot be administered by the formal justice system or courts...|$|R
