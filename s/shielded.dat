50|$|There {{are several}} {{variations}} on the simple Whipple <b>shield.</b> Multi-shock <b>shields,</b> like the one used on the Stardust spacecraft, use multiple bumpers spaced apart to increase the <b>shield's</b> ability to protect the spacecraft. Whipple <b>shields</b> that have a filling in between the rigid layers of the <b>shield</b> are called stuffed Whipple <b>shields.</b> The filling in these <b>shields</b> is usually a high-strength material like Kevlar or Nextel aluminium oxide fiber. The type of <b>shield,</b> the material, thickness and distance between layers are varied to produce a <b>shield</b> with minimal mass that will also minimize the probability of penetration.

The Obsidian's internal systems are capable of withstanding the black hole, but the station cannot shield its human inhabitants from the gravitational forces. The crew have taken refuge in a smaller craft which has been <b>shielded,</b> intending to return to the Obsidian when both vessels have passed through the black hole. A radiation storm has damaged the Obsidian's engine protection systems and erased its flight path, leaving the station drifting towards the black hole where it will be destroyed. Only one member of the crew has the skills necessary to return to the Obsidian and prepare it to pass through the black hole, this is the game's player character. The astronaut is forced to contend with the Obsidian's re-activated security system which has resulted in security robots being deployed, the space station's internal doors sealing and defensive laser grids becoming active. Once the player has restored power, reactivated the Obsidian's engines and reset the station's flight path, there is a limited time to teleport back to the smaller <b>shielded</b> craft before the Obsidian's engines carry the astronaut through the black hole without being <b>shielded.</b>|$|E

5|$|While many welding {{applications}} {{are done in}} controlled environments such as factories and repair shops, some welding processes are commonly used {{in a wide variety}} of conditions, such as open air, underwater, and vacuums (such as space). In open-air applications, such as construction and outdoors repair, <b>shielded</b> metal arc welding is the most common process. Processes that employ inert gases to protect the weld cannot be readily used in such situations, because unpredictable atmospheric movements can result in a faulty weld. <b>Shielded</b> metal arc welding is also often used in underwater welding in the construction and repair of ships, offshore platforms, and pipelines, but others, such as flux cored arc welding and gas tungsten arc welding, are also common. Welding in space is also possible—it was first attempted in 1969 by Russian cosmonauts, when they performed experiments to test <b>shielded</b> metal arc welding, plasma arc welding, and electron beam welding in a depressurized environment. Further testing of these methods was done in the following decades, and today researchers continue to develop methods for using other welding processes in space, such as laser beam welding, resistance welding, and friction welding. Advances in these areas may be useful for future endeavours similar to the construction of the International Space Station, which could rely on welding for joining in space the parts that were manufactured on Earth.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAs {{an effort}} to find a lighter <b>shield,</b> the wood stuffed <b>shield</b> was {{proposed}} in this paper based on the wood properties such as low density, low cost, high yield strength when the strain rate is high. Hypervelocity impact tests (Ф= 5. 5 mm, V= 4. 79 km/s∼ 4. 96 km/s) were carried out to compare the <b>shielding</b> capabilities of the pinewood stuffed <b>shield,</b> aluminum triple-wall <b>shield</b> and Nextel/Kevlar fabric stuffed <b>shield</b> with the same areal density. It was found in all the tests that a perforation with diameter of 2. 0 mm was formed in the rear plate of the aluminum triple-wall <b>shield.</b> No perforation but slight deformation was found in the rear plates of both pinewood stuffed <b>shield</b> and Nextel /Kevlar fabric stuffed <b>shield.</b> The height of the deformation on the rear plates of the pinewood stuffed <b>shield</b> was 1. 99 mmm, and that on the Nextel/Kevlar fabric stuffed <b>shield</b> was 2. 01 mm.

5|$|Doxorubicin is {{also known}} to be fluorescent.

5000|$|Many {{conventional}} coaxial cables use braided {{copper wire}} forming the <b>shield.</b> This allows the cable to be flexible, {{but it also means}} there are gaps in the <b>shield</b> layer, and the inner dimension of the <b>shield</b> varies slightly because the braid cannot be flat. Sometimes the braid is silver-plated. For better <b>shield</b> performance, some cables have a double-layer <b>shield.</b> The <b>shield</b> might be just two braids, but it is more common now to have a thin foil <b>shield</b> covered by a wire braid. Some cables may invest in more than two <b>shield</b> layers, such as [...] "quad-shield", which uses four alternating layers of foil and braid. Other <b>shield</b> designs sacrifice flexibility for better performance; some <b>shields</b> are a solid metal tube.
