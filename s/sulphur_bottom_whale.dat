25|$|A {{news conference}} {{is held by}} Professor Barrel Caskett and his old friend Werner Von Bluecher about the {{upcoming}} journey to the Forbidden Island in a large airship called the <b>Sulphur</b> <b>Bottom</b> {{to search for the}} Mother Lode. Barrel recognizes a reporter, Yuna, as his lost daughter, Matilda Caskett, who warns them of the catastrophe that could transpire if they pursue their journey. Yuna escapes with her servant, a Reaverbot flying machine-like being named Gatz to break the windows for her escape. Ignoring her warning Bluecher continues {{to the center of the}} island. Yuna orders Gatz to give warning shots but due to the hostile retaliation of the <b>Sulphur</b> <b>Bottom,</b> Gatz damages the engine, forcing the airship to descend to the island below.|$|R

When Mega Man returns with the final key to the <b>Sulphur</b> <b>Bottom,</b> Sera orders Geetz to attack the ship and take the keys. Yuna appears in the ship and orders Gatz to fight Geetz. Mega Man stumbles upon Yuna, who then gives some {{reminder}} about his former life and explains to him the terrible catastrophe {{she was trying to}} prevent: Sera's plans for the execution of the [...] "Carbon Reinitialization Program", meant to kill every human from Terra and revive the original humans. Soon after, Mega Man reaches the deck of the <b>Sulphur</b> <b>Bottom</b> and sees Gatz defeated by Geetz. Mega Man is able to defeat Geetz, who, using his last forces, seriously damages Mega Man.|$|R

60|$|BOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER VI. (Sulphur Bottom).--Another {{retiring}} gentleman, with a brimstone belly, doubtless got by scraping {{along the}} Tartarian tiles {{in some of}} his profounder divings. He is seldom seen; at least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas, and then always at too great a distance to study his countenance. He is never chased; he would run away with rope-walks of line. Prodigies are told of him. Adieu, <b>Sulphur</b> <b>Bottom!</b> I can say nothing more that is true of ye, nor can the oldest Nantucketer.|$|R
50|$|Home {{from the}} Hill (1958) is Humphrey’s {{first and most}} famous novel. It {{is the story of}} the aristocratic Hunnicutt family. Captain Wade Hunnicutt, though admirable in many ways, is a philanderer; and his wife, Hannah, {{encourages}} his affairs, even picking his partners, and she unwittingly becomes the catalyst for the catastrophic undoing of the family. The love between their son Theron and Libby Halstead ends when the captain is murdered by Libby’s father: Theron disappears into the <b>Sulphur</b> <b>Bottom</b> swamp as he pursues his father’s killer. Hannah lives another fifteen years in a mental asylum. The Hunnicutt family is a holdover from the Old South; the family is fated to end in destruction for the same reason that the Old South itself was destroyed—because of a moral corruption at its core.|$|R
25|$|Sulphur Springs Ball Park, as it {{was first}} known, was located in an area {{referred}} to by early settlers as French Lick Springs. Pioneers came to this bottomland, or dell, for trading and watering at a natural sulphur spring. Also known as <b>Sulphur</b> Springs <b>Bottom,</b> this later became a popular area for picnicking and recreation.|$|R
25|$|Nashvillians {{started playing}} {{baseball}} {{as early as}} the 1850s. Many local amateur baseball teams played their games at <b>Sulphur</b> Springs <b>Bottom.</b> In order to meet the city's need for a dedicated baseball field, a portion of the dell was designated for this purpose and called Sulphur Springs Ball Park. By 1870, the baseball grounds were referred to as Athletic Park.|$|R
50|$|After {{the war he}} {{operated}} with a gang {{he organized}} with outlaw Lee Rames in the late 1860s, operating out of the <b>Sulphur</b> River <b>bottoms</b> near Bright Star, Arkansas, committing acts of robbery and murder. Authorities credit him officially with killing at least 30 people, though many of these no doubt were killed by his men. Unlike the romanticized versions of his exploits, the reality was that he killed most of them from ambush or in the back, and many with a shotgun, and he almost always had his victims outnumbered. Like many of the ex-Confederates who operated after the war, Baker {{was regarded as a}} hero by some because he opposed the Union occupation, but his record shows a merciless killer who killed anyone who angered him, regardless of their loyalties.|$|R
50|$|From 1903 to 1907, the Nashville {{club was}} unable to muster {{anything}} better than a fifth-place finish. 1904 was their only winning season and by 1907 the team was in last place. Still lacking an official team name, the club {{was referred to as}} the Finnites when Mickey Finn managed the team from 1905 to 1906, the Dobbers when John Dobbs managed the team in 1907, and the Senators, probably due to the nearby Tennessee State Capitol building which overlooked Athletic Park.In 1908, Nashville Tennessean sports writer Grantland Rice held a contest to name the team. The public was invited to mail in votes for one of three team names: the Limerocks (from the abundance of limestone in and around Nashville), the Rocks, and the Volunteers (from the state's nickname, The Volunteer State). The winner and new official team name was the Volunteers, though this was often shortened to Vols. Rice also gave Nashville's Athletic Park a new name: Sulphur Dell, a reference to the location's prior name of <b>Sulphur</b> Springs <b>Bottom.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The first Europeans {{to enter}} {{what would become}} Tennessee {{were part of the}} {{expedition}} led by Hernando de Soto in the 16th century. Although the exact route of the Desoto expedition is unclear, they do not appear to have reached Middle Tennessee or the Nashville area. Instead, the earliest Europeans in what would become Nashville were French fur traders such as Jean du Charleville (aka Charles Charleville), who in 1710 established a trading post at a natural sulphur and saline spring near what is now Bicentennial Capitol Mall State Park. The natural salt lick attracted animals, which in turn attracted Native American hunters with whom the French could trade, and the area became known as [...] "French Lick." [...] This same portion of Nashville would later be known as <b>Sulphur</b> Spring <b>Bottom</b> and <b>Sulphur</b> Dell. In 1769, French-Canadian hunter Timothy Demonbreun began a series of trips up the Cumberland to Nashville and built a cabin near the lick to use as a base of operations for fur trapping during his visits to the area. Demonbreun settled in Nashville permanently in 1788, and ran a tavern and mercantile business.|$|R
40|$|Sixty {{hours of}} direct {{measurements}} of fluorescence {{were collected from}} six bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) instrumented with fluorometers in Greenland in April 2005 and 2006. The data were used to (1) characterize the three-dimensional spatial pattern of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in the water column, (2) to examine the relationships between whale foraging areas and productive zones, and (3) to examine the correlation between whale-derived in situ values of Chl-a and those from concurrent satellite images using the NASA MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) EOS-AQUA satellite (MOD 21, SeaWifs analogue OC 3 M and SST MOD 37). Bowhead whales traversed 1600 km** 2, providing information on diving, Chl-a structure and temperature profiles to depths below 200 m. Feeding dives frequently passed through surface waters (> 50 m) and targeted depths close to the <b>bottom,</b> and <b>whales</b> did not always target patches of high concentrations of Chl-a in the upper 50 m. Five satellite images were available within the periods whales carried fluorometers. Whales traversed 91 pixels collecting on average 761 s (SD 826) of Chl-a samples per pixel (0 - 136 m). The depth of the Chl-a maximum ranged widely, from 1 to 66 m. Estimates of Chl-a made from the water-leaving radiance measurements using the OC 3 M algorithm were highly skewed with most samples estimated as 9 mg/m** 3. The correlation between the satellite-derived and whale-derived Chl-a maxima was poor, a linear fit explained only 10 % of the variance...|$|R
40|$|Exxon Neftegas Limited, as {{operator}} of the Sakhalin- 1 consortium, is developing {{oil and gas}} reserves on the continental shelf off northeast Sakhalin Island, Russia. DalMorNefteGeofizika (DMNG) {{on behalf of the}} Sakhalin- 1 consortium conducted a 3 -D seismic survey of the Odoptu license area during 17 August’ September 2001. A portion of the primary feeding area of the endangered western gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) is located {{in the vicinity of the}} seismic survey. This paper presents data to assess whether western gray <b>whale</b> <b>bottom</b> feeding activity, as indicated by visible mud plumes, was affected by seismic operations. The mitigation and monitoring program associated with the seismic survey included aerial surveys during 19 July’ 9 November 2001. These aerial surveys documented the local and regional distribution, abundance, and bottom feeding activity of western gray whales. Data on gray whale feeding activity before, during and after the seismic survey were collected, with the whales assumed to be feeding on the benthos if mud plumes were observed on the surface. The data were used to assess the influence of seismic survey and other factors (including environmental) on feeding activity of western gray whales. A stepwise multiple regression analysis failed to find a statistically significant effect (α’’. 05) of the seismic survey on frequency of occurrence of mud plumes of western gray whales used as a proxy to evaluate bottom feeding activity in Piltun feeding area. The regression indicated that transect number (a proxy for water depth, related to distance from shore) and swell height (a proxy for sea state) were the only variables that had a significant effect on frequency of whale mud plumes. It is concluded that the 2001 seismic survey had no measurable effect (α’’. 05) on bottom feeding activity of western gray whales off Sakhalin Island...|$|R
