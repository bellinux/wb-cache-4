40|$|According to {{estimates}} of the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, the German building stock contains around 10. 5 billion tonnes of mineral building materials, around 220 million tonnes of timber products and around 100 million tonnes of metals. Due to continuous building activities, especially renovation and retrofit measures, {{it is estimated that}} this raw material stock will grow by a further 20 % until 2050 [1]. Every year more than 450 million tonnes (5. 6 t/person) of mineral raw materials (e. g. sand, gravel) and more than 15. 5 million tonnes (194 kg/person) of metals (e. g. steel, aluminium, copper) are required within the sector for maintaining and constructing new buildings. The focus of this paper is the analysis of construction related raw material flows using material flow analysis (MFA) in Germany. To provide system control options in a circular economy, a deeper knowledge about material flows and stocks is required. A large range of statistical data (e. g. production, import/export, waste etc.) was evaluated and disaggregated, to investigate the impact and <b>self-supply</b> <b>potential</b> through secondary materials, of the German building industry. Currently, the demand cannot be covered by recycled materials leaving the building sector and further primary raw materials are needed. Potentially, only 18 % of the mineral raw materials can be substituted by recycled construction waste. In contrast, for steel and aluminium the substitution rate has reached levels over 40 %...|$|E
40|$|Globally, {{access to}} {{improved}} water sources is lower {{in rural areas}} compared to urban areas. Furthermore, in rural areas many people use water from individual systems they have developed with their investments, often without external support. This phenomenon has been called Self-supply. Self-supply ranges from simple to complex systems and different water sources. Water quality varies, from achieving World Health Organization (WHO) standards (0 CFU/ 100 ml) to systems that provide water posing high risks to human health. While most studies in Self-supply have been developed in Africa, little is known in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). This research explores Self-supply in a rural microcatchment in Colombia (LAC). Data was collected through household and drinking water surveys and analysed. Results showed that 40 % of households used Self-supply systems taking water from springs and brooks. Thermotolerant Coliforms were below 50 CFU/ 100 ml, both in dry and rainy season, and between 5 to 7 % of samples achieved the WHO standard. These results suggest that <b>Self-supply</b> has <b>potential</b> to offer safe drinking water, provided improvements on source protection and institutional support. Therefore, Self-supply could contribute to address “unfinished business”, including ensuring access for the hardest-to-reach people, {{as stated in the}} post- 2015 development agenda.
