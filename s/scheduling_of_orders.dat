40|$|Abstract: We {{present a}} {{two-phase}} model {{for planning and}} <b>scheduling</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> picking processes. In many warehousing environments order picking processes are organized according to the pick&pack principle. Pickers must build stabile loads during the picking process under strict time constrains. A genetic algorithm with Pareto elitist-based selection has been developed for this multi-criteria optimization problem. The resulting order pick lists are the input <b>of</b> the <b>scheduling</b> module. Starting times of the lists are determined with simulation optimization techniques considering time constrain, labor and earliness/tardiness penalty costs, and utilization grades. Costs <b>of</b> <b>order</b> picking can reach as high as fifty percent of all warehousing costs. Travel times consume almost half <b>of</b> a complete <b>order</b> picking tour.

40|$|One of {{the main}} tasks in the {{planning}} of production processes is to satisfy {{the needs of the}} customers in terms of quantity, quality and time. The issue of the timely execution of production orders is becoming increasingly important. Based on the conducted studies it can be concluded that the size of the delay depends on the adopted <b>scheduling</b> <b>of</b> <b>orders.</b> This paper focuses on the problem of implementing a scheduling of production orders that will allow to avoid delays, and in the event such a scheduling is not possible, for minimizing the sum of delays of all the orders. A new algorithm has been proposed that allows to determine of the optimal sequence of production orders with the minimum sum of delays. The considerations have been limited to the issue of a two-machine system in which the orders are carried out in a flow...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{a supply}} chain, {{which consists of}} a manufacturer, a retailer and several suppliers in which the retailer orders jobs to the manufacturer and the suppliers provide the requiring parts. The manufacturer schedules and processes the orders and dispatches them to the retailer either individually or collectively in batches. The manufacturer incurs a penalty cost for each tardy job and a transportation cost for every delivered batch and therefore, searches for a schedule that yields minimum number of tardy jobs and batches. Moreover, the manufacturer tries to optimize its supplying cost through locating the suppliers that offer appropriate release times and costs for manufacturing parts. Since the release times of parts directly affect <b>scheduling</b> <b>of</b> <b>orders,</b> in this research, we develop an integrated mathematical model for the manufacturer that incorporates suppliers' selection issue into the scheduling and batching decisions. Furthermore, we present a heuristic algorithm (greedy algorithm) and also a local search to quickly determine the optimal or near-optimal solutions. The computational analysis shows {{the importance of the}} integrated model and also the superiority and effectiveness of the heuristic algorithms...|$|E

Central task of operative logistics is the efficient supply of required goods at the right place within the right time. Tasks of analytical logistics are designing optimal networks and systems, developing strategies for planning, scheduling and operation, and organizing efficient order and performance processes. Logistic management plans, implements and operates logistic networks and schedules orders, stocks and resources. This reference-book offers a unique survey of modern logistics. It contains proven strategies, rules and tools for the solution of a multitude of logistic problems. The analytically derived algorithms and formulas {{can be used for}} the computer-based planning of logistic systems and for the dynamic <b>scheduling</b> <b>of</b> <b>orders</b> and resources in supply networks. They enable significant improvements of performance, quality and costs. Their application is demonstrated by several examples from industry, trade and service providers. Apart from corrections and modifications the second edition contains a new chapter on maritime logistics.

In this context, this paper discusses experiments that measure the effect <b>of</b> adding randomized <b>scheduling</b> <b>of</b> partially <b>ordered</b> events to {{configuration management}} tools. Three characteristics <b>of</b> randomized <b>scheduling</b> are investigated: efficiency, robustness and security. A configuration management process is efficient if it minimizes the use of resources. It is robust if it is not vulnerable to malicious acts or inadvertent human errors. It is secure if its management model is hidden from observers. Several experiments suggest that randomized <b>scheduling</b> <b>of</b> partially <b>ordered</b> events has advantages over commonly used deterministic strategies, on average producing more efficient schedules. Further, randomized scheduling greatly degrades the accuracy of observer predictions of future behavior. In addition, randomized scheduling obscures the management model such that an observer will have to make a large number <b>of</b> observations in <b>order</b> to obtain the complete management model. The results of the study support the use of randomization in automatic configuration management tools...|$|R

A flexible augmented ACD model is estimated to capture the duration cluster patterns for trade durations in a limit order book by analyzing the arrival process of trades in the electronic markets.

40|$|Abstract: We {{consider}} a make-to-order production–distribution system with one supplier {{and one or}} more customers. A set <b>of</b> <b>orders</b> with due dates needs to be processed by the supplier and delivered to the customers upon completion. The supplier can process one order at a time without preemption. Each customer is at a distinct location and only orders from the same customer can be batched together for delivery. Each delivery shipment has a capacity limit and incurs a distribution cost. The problem {{is to find a}} joint <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> processing at the supplier and order delivery from the supplier to the customers that optimizes an objective function involving the maximum delivery tardiness and the total distribution cost. We first study the solvability of various cases of the problem by either providing an efficient algorithm or proving the intractability of the problem. We then develop a fast heuristic for the general problem. We show that the heuristic is asymptotically optimal as the number <b>of</b> <b>orders</b> goes to infinity. We also evaluate the performance of the heuristic computationally by using lower bounds obtained by a column generation approach. Our results indicate that the heuristic is capable of generating near optimal solutions quickly. Finally, we study the value of production–distribution integration by comparing our integrated approach with two sequential approaches where scheduling decisions for order processing are made first, followed by order delivery decisions, with no or only partial integration of the two decisions. We show that in many cases, the integrated approach performs significantly better than th...|$|R
