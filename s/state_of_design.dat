50|$|In 2005 Banham began {{a series}} of forum events {{discussing}} the social role of typography and graphic design. Known as Character these events were held alongside the <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Design</b> Festivals attracting up to 500 people at a time. These events took a different form each year. First appearing as an open discussion format looking into the branding of cities (2005), The politics of graphic design (2005), The role of accident in design (2006) and 26 Letters a Second - typography and the moving image (2007) which featured the Australian premiere of Helvetica, including a discussion with Gary Hustwit who was brought out for the event. In 2008 The fifth Character event saw the publishing of Characters and Spaces in partnership with the <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Design</b> Festival. This free booklet, bound within the festival program, featured one city block of Melbournes design secrets from the stories behind corporate identities through to art and architecture. Character 6 (2010) saw the Australian premiere of the documentary film TypeFace from Chicago, along with a discussion on the slow design movement in graphic design and the resurgence in craft.|$|E

50|$|Pursuing {{the idea}} of a civil tandem rotor helicopter, Hafner and his team {{developed}} a much larger design, the Type 194. This was in an advanced <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>design</b> when the Bristol Helicopter Division was merged, as a result of government influence, with the helicopter interests of other British aircraft manufacturers (Westland, Fairey and Saunders-Roe) to form Westland Helicopters in 1960. The Type 194 was cancelled as it was in competition with Westland's and Fairey's large helicopter designs such as the Westland Westminster and the Fairey Rotodyne.|$|E
50|$|An {{advantage}} of the cam engine over the crankshaft {{is that it is}} a simple task to provide the cam with multiple lobes per revolution, giving more piston strokes for the same output shaft speed. The multiple lobes, either four or six of them, have the same overall effect as an output shaft reduction gearbox would. This was particularly useful for marine engines, driving a more efficient low-speed propeller. For two engines with the same shaft speed, this may also be considered as having the pistons running six times as fast: effectively a bigger and more powerful engine, yet weighing around the same. A limit on this though would have been the metallurgical limits of piston linear velocity. At this time, the maximum speed that a piston and its rings could travel within a cylinder was limited by <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>design</b> and lubrication techniques to maintain a good seal and avoid seizure. This was especially difficult for two-stroke diesel engines, as the constant downward force on the piston ring, rather than the cyclical variation of the four-stroke engine, tended to cause it to stick in its groove.|$|E
5000|$|Jongerius’s {{perspective}} on sustainability in design {{is that it}} should be built to last. She has an issue with ephemeral, low-quality objects put out into the world."There's too much shit design." [...] "It's not the design that is the real issue but the amount that is being produced, that is where the evil starts; it just doesn't really add anything to the world."Jongerius follows the ideals of long-termism. She sees this as a solve for the wastefulness of design. She wishes modern designers would follow in the paths of 20th century industrial design greats such as Le Corbusier and Gerrit Rietveld. Jongerius believes that designers are either “merchants” or “pastors”. These “merchants” are guilty, in her mind, of producing too much that doesn’t last. “Merchants are the ones who keep the machine spinning for profit without any conscience and pastors are the ones who want to change something in the world and feel responsible.”Theorist Louise Schouwenberg and Jongerius published an opinion piece called Beyond the New: a search for ideals in design about the current <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>design</b> and sustainability.“We are in search for new ideals in design, a holistic approach on all levels." ...|$|E

50|$|Bassett-Lowke was {{actively}} interested in modern design, notably becoming a {{patron of the}} architect and designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh, who remodelled Basset-Lowke's home at 78 Derngate, Northampton. Now a Grade II* listed building, the house (which has been fully restored) is now open as a museum and visitor attraction. He also employed the services of the stained glass artist E.W. Twining to provide much of his company's graphic identity. His close contacts with German toy manufacturers, particularly Gebruder Bing, {{introduced him to the}} very advanced <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>design</b> in Germany and organisations such as the Deutscher Werkbund. He was quick to join its British equivalent, The Design and Industries Association, founded {{at the opening of the}} Great War. It is notable that in 1925-6 Lowke commissioned the German architect-designer Peter Behrens to design his house 'New Ways' in Northampton (now considered the first modernist building in the UK) rather than any UK architect. Lowke professed to Fabian socialist politics and greatly admired George Bernard Shaw (to the extent of having him modelled as an '0' scale railway platform accessory). He supported Stephan Bing and other members of the family when, as Jews, they fled Nazi Germany to the UK in 1933.|$|E
