5|$|Although it {{has since}} been {{replaced}} {{with a number of}} smaller displays available to the public in the reception area <b>showing</b> <b>some</b> traditional Scouting skills, a notable collection of Baden-Powell memorabilia has been on display in the past for visitors in 'The story of B-P' exhibition. This included many drawings and letters by Baden-Powell himself, such as the original of his , Laws for me when I am old and several first editions of his books. The former exhibition also displayed the original painting by David Jagger, as presented to Baden-Powell on 29 August 1929 at the 'Coming of Age' 3rd World Scout Jamboree. This painting, a personal favourite of Baden-Powell, is often used in publications throughout the Scout movement. The Baden-Powell memorabilia has since been moved to the headquarters for Scouting in the UK, Gilwell Park.|$|E

5|$|Brudenell {{was a fine}} rider and, {{inspired}} by the decisive role of cavalry {{at the battle of}} Waterloo, his wish was to purchase a commission in a fashionable regiment and serve as an army officer. His father, however, mindful of preserving the family pedigree from risk of battle, would not allow this. Instead in November 1815 he was sent up to Christ Church, Oxford; as an aristocrat he was automatically granted admission without examination. He left in his third year—aristocrats with no academic bent were released after only two years—but despite <b>showing</b> <b>some</b> aptitude, he did not take a degree.|$|E
5|$|In 2012 {{the museum}} was headed by Sujatmiko. That year David Kristian Budhiyanto of Petra Christian University wrote that {{the museum was}} rarely visited and in some places poorly maintained. He posited this {{to be based on}} a popular view of museums as unexciting or boring places. In order to attract new visitors, the museum has {{initiated}} several competitions in 2012 and 2013, including a photography contest on the museum's Facebook page. It has also undertaken mobile exhibitions, <b>showing</b> <b>some</b> of its collection in cities such as Yogyakarta and Magelang. Between January and September 2013 the museum received 26,249 visitors, an increase of 250 per cent over the previous year's target; this was credited to the various promotional efforts undertaken. The museum is now promoted as a site for educational tourism and accepts donations of materials related to the press in Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|Outside Tsubasa, Sakura makes various {{appearances}} in Clamp's manga xxxHolic, <b>showing</b> <b>some</b> {{of the events}} happening in Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle. Sakura also appears in later volumes when her soul is separated from her body {{and sent to the}} Dream World. There, she meets Yūko's assistant, a teenager named Kimihiro Watanuki, whom she finds similar to the original Syaoran. One of her feathers – that of her memories of Syaoran – appears in Watanuki's world and gives the medium Kohane Tsuyuri the ability to exorcise spirits. After Kohane wishes for the removal of her ability, the feather stays with a black Mokona Modoki. Sakura does not appear in the animated adaptions of xxxHolic until the original video animations series xxxHolic Shunmuki, in which she appears in the Dream World talking with Watanuki.|$|E

40|$|The {{screening}} of 86 marine bacterial strains associated with marine invertebrates, algae, sediment, artificial sponges and sea {{water from the}} coastal waters of the Iriomote Islands (Japan) has been carried out. The {{purpose of this study}} was to get various strains of marine bacteria that are beneficial to the production of bioactive compounds. The {{screening of}} antibacterial activity produced by strains of marine bacteria was carried out using the paper disk method. Antibacterial activity test results showed that one strain of bacteria <b>showed</b> <b>some</b> activity against Bacillus subtilis and Cautobacter halobacteroides, two strains of bacteria <b>showed</b> <b>some</b> activity against Staphylococcus aureus, four strains of bacteria <b>showed</b> <b>some</b> activity against Cytophaga marinoflava, 63 strains of bacteria <b>showed</b> <b>some</b> activity against Vibrio harveyi and 14 strains of bacteria <b>showed</b> <b>some</b> activity against Pseudovibrio sp., while Salinivibrio costicola showed no antibacterial activity. This indicates that about 78 % of all the bacterial strains isolated have the potential to produce bioactive compounds...|$|R
5|$|The Girl {{made its}} {{television}} {{debut in the}} United States on 20 October 2012 on HBO and aired in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on 26 December. Jones and Miller were nominated for awards at the 2013 Golden Globe Awards and the British Academy Television Awards for their roles in the film, which received mixed reviews from critics. The Daily Mirror Jane Simon praised Miller's portrayal of Hedren. Although she endorsed the film, Hedren said its length kept it from <b>showing</b> <b>some</b> of {{the positive aspects of}} her relationship with Hitchcock. Others who knew (and worked with) Hitchcock criticised the film because of its portrayal of him as a sexual predator. Kim Novak (who starred in one of Hitchcock's films) and Nora Brown (widow of one of Hitchcock's close friends) disputed the film's version of events.|$|E
5|$|A second {{victim is}} found, {{this time a}} man whose eyes have been removed by forced surgery. Again, they {{discover}} the eyes were obtained from organ donation, and they find a connection to a woman called Amanda (Anja Savcic), a ballerina who had committed suicide. They also note the care that the culprit performed the work, and speculate that the person {{they are looking for}} is <b>showing</b> <b>some</b> compassion for his victims, calling for emergency help and using the serum to hope that they are given the proper care in time. They find that Amanda's alleged cremated remains are bogus, and that her body had been stolen before it could be cremated. They start to trace connections to Amanda, finding she was in a depression counseling support group. Though there are several possible suspects, Olivia's intuition leads her to a man named Roland David Barrett (Mark Ivanir), who was noted to have become enamored with Amanda at the meetings. At Roland's home, he has recovered the corpse and surgically replaced the organs in her body. Using a makeshift set of ropes and pulleys, Roland engages Amanda's body in a marionette act to make her perform like a ballerina, promising her he will bring her back to life.|$|E
5|$|Their {{frustration}} clearly apparent, the Virginia Tech offense fared {{no better}} on their next possession. Two plays were stopped for no gain, {{and the only}} positive play—a five-yard pass to Eddie Royal—was negated by a false start penalty. The Hokies were again forced to punt the ball away to Florida State, their fifth of the game. The punt allowed FSU to start at their own 46-yard line, and at first, the Seminoles were able to capitalize on that opportunity, <b>showing</b> <b>some</b> of the effectiveness that characterized their prior drive. Lorenzo Booker ran for 24yards on two plays, but afterwards, Drew Weatherford threw two incompletions. A false start penalty backed up the Seminoles, who were forced to punt after failing {{to pick up the}} first down. The kick was an excellent one, and Florida State's special teams were able to get downfield and stop the ball inside the Virginia Tech one-yard line, again hurting the Hokie offense.|$|E
