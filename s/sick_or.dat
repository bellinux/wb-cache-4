40|$|A {{scheme of}} {{insurance}} against {{loss of earnings}} due to sickness is proposed, which is optimal {{in the sense that}} it enforces contractual absence rates generated by an optimal sorting of workers among jobs. Schemes of <b>sick</b> pay <b>or</b> <b>sick</b> leave that are implemented by governments and firms and are known to the author all impose additional constraints. There is thus an a priori case that these schemes are suboptimal. 1 The idea in this paper emerged during a conversation with Ron Oaxaca. Correspondence with David Malueg has been very helpful. The paper was drafted during a visit to the University of Arizona, and has benefited from discussions at seminars at Université Panthéon-Assas (Paris II) and Aberdeen. <b>Sick</b> pay <b>or</b> <b>sick</b> leave is a common feature of institutional arrangements in many developed countries.

50|$|Furthermore, data {{collected}} from the National Health Interview Survey in a 1999 study indicates that foreign-born children are five {{times more likely than}} American-born children to lack a constant source of health care.
