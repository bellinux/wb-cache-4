40|$|The {{environmental}} and economic performance of <b>silvoarable</b> <b>agroforestry</b> in Europe is highly variable. Multi-criteria analysis, using the PROMETHEE outranking approach, {{was used to evaluate}} the integrated performance of <b>silvoarable</b> <b>agroforestry</b> on hypothetical farms in nineteen landscape test sites in Spain, France, and The Netherlands. The silvoarable scenarios allocated a proportion of the hypothetical farms (10 or 50 %) to <b>silvoarable</b> <b>agroforestry</b> at two different tree densities (50 or 113 trees ha¿ 1) on two different qualities of land (best or worst quality land). The status quo (conventional arable farming) was also assessed for comparison. The criteria used in the evaluation (soil erosion, nitrogen leaching, carbon sequestration, landscape biodiversity, and infinite net present value) were assessed at each landscape test site; infinite net present value was assessed under six levels of government support. In France, the analysis showed, assuming equal weighting between {{environmental and}} economic performance, that <b>silvoarable</b> <b>agroforestry</b> was preferable to conventional arable farming. The best results were observed when agroforestry was implemented on 50 % of the highest quality land on the farm; the effect of tree density (50 ¿ 113 trees ha¿ 1) was small. By contrast, in Spain and The Netherlands, the consistently greater profitability of conventional arable agriculture relative to the agroforestry alternatives made overall performance of agroforestry systems dependent on the proportion of the farm planted, and the tree density and land quality used...|$|E

40|$|Agroforestry {{is a term}} which {{describes}} systems in which trees, animals and/or crops are grown together in intimate mixtures. The term does not include farm woodlands which do not involve significant biological or environmental interactions between the woodland and agricultural components. A number of papers in this volume have discussed the possibility of increasing timber production in Cumbria, in response to Britain's present high rate of timber imports and excess agricultural production. Agroforestry could contribute to this increased timber production in a manner which would be attractive to the farming community because land would sustain a significant agricultural income whilst the trees were maturing. There are several types of <b>agroforestry.</b> <b>Silvoarable</b> systems are mixtures of trees and crops, while silvopastoralism describes intimate mixtures of trees and animals. Agrenforestry is a term used here to emphasize the co-production of bioenergy crops with agricultural and timber crops. Agrenforestry, described later in more detail, could involve strips of energy coppice amongst agricultural crops, {{or the use of}} coppice beneath wide-spaced standard trees. It has been suggested (Lawson 1987) that there are five possible uses for rural land — food, fibre, fuel, pharmaceuticals and fun. This paper moves up the alphabet to discuss five criteria for land use decisions: economics, energy, environment, employment and enjoyment...|$|R

40|$|<b>Silvoarable</b> <b>agroforestry</b> could promote use {{of trees}} on farms in Europe, but its likely effect on production, farm profitability, and {{environmental}} services is poorly understood. Hence, from 2001 to 2005, the <b>Silvoarable</b> <b>Agroforestry</b> for Europe project developed a systematic process {{to evaluate the}} biophysical and economic performance of arable, forestry, and silvoarable systems in Spain, France, and The Netherlands. A biophysical model called ¿Yield-SAFE¿ was developed to predict long-term yields for the different systems and local statistics and expert opinion were used to derive their revenue, costs, and pre- and post- 2005 grant regimes. These data were then used in an economic model called ¿Farm-SAFE¿ to predict plot- and farm-scale profitability. Land equivalent ratios were greater than one, showing Yield-SAFE predicted that growing trees and crops in silvoarable systems was more productive than growing them separately. Pre- 2005 grants in Spain and The Netherlands penalised silvoarable systems, but post- 2005 grants were more equitable. In France, walnut and poplar silvoarable systems were consistently the most profitable system under both grant regimes. In Spain, holm oak and stone pine silvoarable systems were the least profitable system under pre- 2005 grants, but only marginally less profitable than arable systems under post- 2005 grants. In The Netherlands, low timber values and the opportunity cost of losing arable land for slurry manure application made silvoarable and forestry systems uncompetitive with arable systems under both grant regime...|$|E
40|$|Currently, <b>silvoarable</b> <b>agroforestry</b> is {{receiving}} {{renewed interest in}} Europe, as a land use system that allows for combining the production of commodities {{with a range of}} non-commodity outputs, such as environmental protection. Despite the potential of this practice, it remains rarely implemented in Northwestern Europe. One of the obstacles in the adoption of <b>silvoarable</b> <b>agroforestry</b> systems is the lack of quantitative knowledge on the long term performance of different crops when they are competing for resources with trees. In the face {{of a wide range of}} possibilities, it remains difficult to obtain a clear overview of overall system functioning. In this thesis, we simplify this complexity by focusing our research questions on the resource of light, based on the assumption that in Belgian climatic conditions light is likely to be the predominant constraint for understorey crops in a <b>silvoarable</b> <b>agroforestry</b> system. With regard to this resource, we develop our research in order to gain insights into the growth mechanisms and final yield of shaded winter wheat and sugar beet crops. We address these questions using an artificial shade system, which has been developed to reproduce the effect of the heterogeneous spatio-temporal pattern of light observed under late-flushing trees in an agroforestry system, isolated from the competition effects for water and nutrients. The shade structures recreate two shade environments: continuous and periodic. The continuous shade treatment leads to shade throughout the entire day, while the periodic shade treatment induces an intermittent shade period, which varies during the day and according to structure orientation. Winter wheat responded to the late application of both shade treatments with a significant decrease in grain yield, which was partly compensated for by an increase in grain protein content. When shaded, sugar beet compensated through morphological adaptations of the aboveground part of the plant, and by a decrease in the final root dry matter and sugar yield. Overall, for both crops, the magnitude of the final yield repercussion varied with the level and period of shade application. Additionally, an arable plot bordered by a row of poplar trees was selected to evaluate the effect of real trees on the winter wheat. The reduction in the final grain yield follows a gradient, from underneath the trees to the centre of the field. Notwithstanding that interactions other than light competition may have occurred, the maximum yield reduction observed under the trees never reaches the level of decrease which is observed under the continuous shade treatment simulated by the artificial shade arrangement. This experimental approach with winter wheat was complemented by a modelling study, in which we evaluate the ability of the STICS crop model to simulate crops growing under dynamic shade. The results highlight the limits of the STICS model when it is used to simulate crop growth under contrasted shade conditions. Finally, we propose agroecology as a conceptual framework for developing sustainable and profitable agroforestry systems in Europe, and reflect on agricultural practices, food systems, and research methodologies...|$|E
40|$|In Europe, {{agroforestry}} {{systems have}} been used mainly in traditional agriculture to provide a variety of agricultural and tree products. However, {{during the last three}} centuries, the agricultural landscape in Europe has seen a steady reduction of agroforestry. The reduction has been greatest since 1950, as the introduction of land consolidation programmes and agricultural mechanisation encouraged the removal of hedges and isolated trees from agricultural land. However, as the environmental costs of intensive agriculture have become apparent, there has been an increasing interest in the promotion of ecologically sound practices. Novel silvoarable techniques could potentially offer a range of environmental and economic benefits in comparison with conventional arable cropping. The EU project " <b>Silvoarable</b> <b>Agroforestry</b> for Europe " investigated the European context of modern <b>silvoarable</b> <b>agroforestry.</b> It aimed to reduce uncertainties concerning the productivity and profitability of silvoarable systems, and to suggest European policy guidelines for agroforestry implementation. Within this broad framework, an integrated assessment of the environmental and economic performance of SAF was undertaken with the objective of assisting decision-makers implement ecologically sound land management practices. This was done in four steps: (i) developing an environmental assessment platform, (ii) applying the platform to test sites across Europe, (iii) co-ordinating economic assessments to the same test sites, and (iv) joining both environmental and economic results into an integrated interpretation. Chapter 2 describes the environmental assessment methodology to evaluate SAF systems b ased on the adaptation of existing models and the development of specific algorithms to predict the environmental effects of SAF at a farm- and landscape-scale. M odeling is needed when experiments are costly or too time consuming {{as in the case of}} agroforestry, where we assumed an average rotation to last 60 years. The framework comprised the assessment of soil erosion, nitrogen leaching, carbon sequestration and landscape diversity and allowed the comparison of the environmental performance of SAF with arable monocropping using these four indicators. The method opted for a broad view of the four environmental indicators, is applicable over a large geographic range (from Mediterranean to Temperate Europe) and is based on spatial data that are generally available. The method was tested in three landscape test sites in Spain, in France and in The Netherlands. A total of five tree species were modelled: wild cherry (Prunus avium L.), black walnut (Juglans hybr.), poplar (Populus spp), holm oak (Quercus ilex L. subsp. ilex) and stone pine (Pinus pinea L.).   Chapter 3 systematically assesses the environmental effects of SAF for a stratified random sample of 19 landscape test sites (LTS) in Mediterranean and Atlantic regions of Europe. For each LTS, existing geographical and statistical data were compiled, harmonized and complemented by field surveys. LTS were subdivided into a maximum of four land units (LU) using cluster analysis. The LUs were considered to be homogenous with respect to soil properties and climatic conditions and were used to represent farm management units. The LUs were ranked according to their potential productivity from "best land" to "worst land". The impact of SAF was explored by introducing SAF over 10 % or 50 % of the farm/landscape to simulate "pessimistic" and "optimistic" adoption by the farmer. Two tree densities (50 and 113 trees ha - 1) were compared and SAF could be implemented in the best or worst quality land of the LTS to simulate different management priorities. Across the 19 landscape test sites, SAF had a positive impact on the four environmental indicators with the strongest effects when introduced on the best quality land.   The computer simulations showed that SAF could significantly reduce erosion by up to 65 % when combined with contouring practices. Nitrogen leaching could be reduced by up to 28 % in areas where leaching currently is high (> 100 kg N ha - 1 a - 1), but this was dependent on tree density.   With agroforestry, predicted mean carbon sequestration, over a 60 -year period, ranged from 0. 1 to 3. 0 t C ha - 1 a - 1 (5 to 179 t C ha - 1) depending on tree species and location.   Landscape biodiversity was increased by introducing SAF by an average factor of 2. 6.    From the beginning of the research, Chapters 3 and 4 were co-ordinated and carried out in the same test sites. While Chapter 3 assessed the environmental effects of <b>silvoarable</b> <b>agroforestry,</b> Chapter 4 evaluated the profitability of the same scenarios as Chapter 3. Time-series of annual production data and economic data for crops and trees (grants, revenue and costs) for each LTS were combined in the farm-scale bio-economic spreadsheet model FarmSAFE.   The economic performance of the arable and silvoarable systems was compared using the infinite net present value (iNPV) for a time-frame of 60 years (discount rate = 4 %). The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) payments were modelled for arable and silvoarable systems assuming: 1) No CAP payments; 2) Pre- 2005 CAP payments; and 3) Post- 2005 CAP payments, assuming in the case of silvoarable systems that a Single Farm Payments would be made to the whole cropped area (whilst cropping occurred) and that 50 % of tree costs would be covered for the initial 4 years of the tree rotation. The analysis in France suggests that walnut and poplar silvoarable systems could provide a profitable alternative to arable and forestry systems, while in Spain a modest restructuring of the amount and delivery of agricultural payments would increase the attractiveness of silvoarable systems of holm oak and stone pine.   In the Netherlands, low timber value and the opportunity cost of losing arable land for slurry manure application made both silvoarable and forestry systems uncompetitive with arable systems.    Chapter 5 is the integration of results obtained in Chapters 3 and 4 into a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The PROMETHEE outranking approach was used to evaluate the integrated performance of <b>silvoarable</b> <b>agroforestry</b> relative to a status quo, on hypothetical farms in the nineteen LTS in Spain, France, and the Netherlands. The criteria used in the evaluation were soil erosion, nitrogen leaching, carbon sequestration, landscape biodiversity, and infinite net present value, the latter assessed under six levels of government support. The MCDA was not configured to reflect the position of a specific stakeholder (e. g. an NGO might rate environmental criteria higher than profitability, whereas farmers might rate profitability higher than environmental criteria) but a neutral weight distribution was adopted. In France, the analysis showed, assuming equal weighting between environmental and economic performance, that <b>silvoarable</b> <b>agroforestry</b> was preferable to conventional arable farming.   The best results were observed when agroforestry was implemented on 50 % of the highest quality land on the farm; the effect of tree density (50 - 113 trees ha - 1) was small.   By contrast, in Spain and the Netherlands, the consistently greater profitability of conventional arable agriculture relative to the agroforestry alternatives made overall performance of agroforestry systems dependent on the proportion of the farm planted, and the tree density and land quality used. The environmental and economic performance of SAF in Europe is highly variable since each country/region has its specific biophysical and economic conditions. However, in Europe, ecological integrity is increasingly seen as fundamental to economic and social well-being.   This work provided an initial approach for an integrated environmental and economic analysis of SAF systems. The findings could be refined to support policy development for <b>silvoarable</b> <b>agroforestry</b> as a new land-use alternative for farmers. At the same time, the framework could be adapted to the investigation of environmental and economic consequences of other land-use alternatives (e. g. new crops, forestation) at the landscape / farm scale...|$|E
40|$|<b>Silvoarable</b> <b>Agroforestry</b> (SAF), the {{deliberate}} combined use {{of trees and}} crops on the same area of land, can potentially improve the environmental performance of agricultural systems in Europe. However, such changes in land use {{also need to be}} seen in terms of their economic implications. The present study makes a combined environmental and economic assessment of poplar SAF near Torrijos in Castilla la Mancha in Spain. Six different silvoarable systems were compared with existing arable agriculture. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) was used to predict soil erosion under the different silvoarable and arable systems and an economic model was used to predict their NPV. SAF with contouring decreased predicted soil loss by 80 % compared with the existing arable system. Economic analysis showed that the NPV of densely planted, but widely spaced silvoarable systems could be similar to the NPV of existing arable systems. However, current grant schemes were higher for the arable systems and made the silvoarable systems less attractive in terms of cash flow and NPV. It is concluded that where soil erosion is problematic, grant systems should not increase the attractiveness of arable systems at the expense of SAF...|$|E
40|$|<b>Silvoarable</b> <b>Agroforestry</b> (SAF) could {{mitigate}} negative {{environmental impacts}} of agricultural land use in Europe. In a geographic information system (GIS) data on soil, climate, topography, and land cover were integrated to identify agroforestry target regions where productive growth of trees in SAF systems can be expected and where, at the same time, SAF systems could potentially reduce risk of soil erosion, contribute to groundwater protection and increase landscape diversity. The environmental benefits could justify the support of SAF by subsidies. Target regions for SAF systems were identified for Pinus pinea, Juglans ssp., Populus spp., Quercus ilex and Prunus avium. The investigation covers the entire European continent. The analysis shows that SAF systems are possible on 56 % of arable land throughout Europe (potential distribution area). On 85 % of the European arable land environmental problems are high (even on soil erosion, nitrate leaching or landscape diversity). Overlaying potential distribution areas for SAF with environmental problem areas on arable land, gives the target regions in Europe. This area is about 40 % of the arable land and the environmental problems could be reduced on about 9 % for soil erosion, on 45 % for nitrate leaching and on 79 % for landscape diversity...|$|E
40|$|Modern alley {{cropping}} designs, with trees aligned in rows and adapted to operating farming machinery, {{have been suggested}} for Europe. This paper explores the potential for adoption of cork oak (Quercus suber L.) agroforestry in Portugal and estimates the potential carbon sequestration. Spatial modeling and Portuguese datasets were used to estimate target areas where cork oak could grow on farmland. Different implementation scenarios were then modeled for this area assuming a modern <b>silvoarable</b> <b>agroforestry</b> system (113 trees ha- 1 thinned at year 20 for establishing 50 trees ha- 1). The YieldSAFE process-based model was used to predict the biomass and carbon yield of cork oak under low and high soil water holding capacity levels. Approximately 353, 000 ha are available in Portugal for new cork oak {{alley cropping}}. Assuming implementation rates between 10 % of the area with low soil water capacity (60 mm: 15 cm depth, coarse texture) and 70 %of the areawith high soilwater holding capacity (1, 228 mm: 200 cm depth, very fine texture), then carbon sequestration could be 5 9 106 and 123 9 106 Mg CO 2 respectively. Due to higher yields on more productive land, scenarios of limited implementation in high productivity locations can sequester similar amounts of carbon as wide implementation on low productivity land, suggesting that a priori land classification assessments can improve the targeting of land and financial incentives for carbon sequestratio...|$|E

In order to improve the understanding of farmers’ perceptions of such systems, detailed face-to-face interviews were completed with 15 farmers in Bedfordshire, England. Most of these farmers thought that silvoarable systems would not be profitable on their farms and that benefits would tend to be environmental or social rather than economic. Most farmers also thought that management and use of machinery would become more difficult. They felt that the tree component could potentially disrupt field operations and drainage and expressed concerns over the uncertain and long-term nature of timber revenue {{and the effect of}} intercrop yield reductions on crop revenue. Even so, 20 % of the farmers stated they would use silvoarable systems if convinced that they were more profitable than conventional arable farming. A further 20 % said they would farm the intercrop area belonging to someone else, if the rent was reduced to compensate for crop yield reductions. These results suggest that for most arable farmers, an economic advantage over current practice needs to exist before silvoarable systems are likely to be adopted. However, a minority might rent the crop component of a silvoarable system from another party or implement a full system for perceived environmental or social benefits...|$|E
40|$|<b>Silvoarable</b> <b>agroforestry,</b> the {{integration}} of trees and arable crops on the same area, {{has the potential to}} offer production, ecological, and societal benefits. However, the uptake of such systems in Europe has been limited by a combination of unsupportive policies and uncertainty concerning their productivity, profitability, and environmental impact. Faced with a lack of experimental data, the parameter-sparse Yield-SAFE model offers one method for generating plausible yield data and improving understanding of production in mixed tree–crop systems under European conditions. The applicability of the model was examined by: (i) selecting two contrasting sites in France and the UK with measured agricultural, silvoarable and/or forestry data, (ii) implementing the model in a software package, and (iii) inputting data and parameters on the climate, soils, management regime, and tree and crop types. Following calibration, Yield-SAFE provided credible descriptions of measured arable and tree (Populus spp.) yields in the monoculture and silvoarable systems at the two sites. An examination of the response of the model to changes in model parameters and environmental and management data showed that silvoarable crop yields were most sensitive to variations in tree parameters. Increased soil depths increased timber yields, and increasing stand density increased stand volume whilst decreasing individual tree volume. In all the simulations, the model predicted greater efficiency in use of land, i. e. greater land equivalent ratios, when trees and crops were combined rather than grown as sole crops. These results, supported by the sparse experimental data available, indicate that agroforestry provides a method of increasing food, timber and biomass production from limited land resources in Euro...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{adoption}} of <b>silvoarable</b> <b>agroforestry</b> (SAF) systems in Europe, by integrating trees and arable crops {{on the same}} land, could offer a range of environmental benefits compared with conventional agricultural systems. Soil erosion, nitrogen leaching, carbon sequestration and landscape biodiversity were chosen as indicators to assess a stratified random sample of 19 landscape test sites in the Mediterranean and Atlantic regions of Europe. At each site, the effect of introducing agroforestry was examined at plot-scale by simulating the growth of one of five tree species (hybrid walnut Juglans spp., wild cherry Prunus avium L., poplar Populus spp., holm oak Quercus ilex L. subsp. ilex and stone pine Pinus pinea L.) at two tree densities (50 and 113 trees ha- 1) in combination with up to five crops (wheat Triticum spp., sunflower Helianthus annuus L., oilseed rape Brassica napus L., grain maize and silage maize Zea mays L.). At landscape-scale, the effect of introducing agroforestry on 10 or 50 % of the agricultural area, on either the best or worst quality land, was examined. Across the 19 landscape test sites, SAF had {{a positive impact on}} the four indicators with the strongest effects when introduced on the best quality land.

40|$|Aim To determine, for {{arable land}} in a {{temperate}} area, the effect of tree establishment and intercropping treatments, {{on the distribution of}} roots and soil organic carbon to a depth of 1. 5 m. Methods A poplar (Populus sp.) <b>silvoarable</b> <b>agroforestry</b> experiment including arable controls was established on arable land in lowland England in 1992. The trees were intercropped with an arable rotation or bare fallow for the first 11 years, thereafter grass was allowed to establish. Coarse and fine root distributions (to depths of up to 1. 5 m and up to 5 m from the trees) were measured in 1996, 2003, and 2011. The amount and type of soil carbon to 1. 5 m depth was also measured in 2011. Results The trees, initially surrounded by arable crops rather than fallow, had a deeper coarse root distribution with less lateral expansion. In 2011, the combined length of tree and understorey vegetation roots was greater in the agroforestry treatments than the control, at depths below 0. 9 m. Between 0 and 1. 5 m depth, the fine root carbon in the agroforestry treatment (2. 56 t ha- 1) was 79 % greater than that in the control (1. 43 t ha- 1). Although the soil organic carbon in the top 0. 6 m under the trees (161 t C ha- 1) was greater than in the control (142 t C ha- 1), a tendency for smaller soil carbon levels beneath the trees at lower depths, meant that there was no overall tree effect when a 1. 5 m soil depth was considered. From a limited sample, there was no tree effect on the proportion of recalcitrant soil organic carbon. Conclusions The observed decline in soil carbon beneath the trees at soil depths greater than 60 cm, if observed elsewhere, has important implication for assessments of the role of afforestation and agroforestry in sequestering carbon...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{the world}} soils carbon stocks {{by a factor}} of 4 per mil {{annually}} would compensate the annual net increase of CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere. This statement is the core of an initiative launched by the French government at the recent COP 21, followed by many countries and international bodies, which attracts political attention to the storage potential of C in soils. Compared to forest and pasture soils, agricultural soils have a higher C storage potential, because they are often characterized by low C contents, and increasing their C content is associated with benefits in terms of soil properties and ecosystem services. Here we quantified, under temperate conditions, the additional C storage related to the implementation of two set of practices that are recognized to be in the framework of agroecology: conservation tillage {{on the one hand and}} agroforestry on the other hand. These studies were based on long-term experiments, a 16 -years comparison on cropping systems on luvisols in the Paris area and a 18 -year-old <b>silvoarable</b> <b>agroforestry</b> trial, on fluvisols in southern France, the main crops being cereals in both cases. C stocks were measured on an equivalent soil mass basis. Both systems allowed for a net storage of C in soils, which are, for the equivalent of the 0 - 30 cm tilled layer, of 0. 55 ± 0. 16 t ha‑ 1 yr‑ 1 for conservation agriculture (i. e. no tillage with permanent soil coverage with an associated plant, fescue or alfalfa) and of 0. 25 ± 0. 03 t ha- 1 yr- 1 for the agroforestry system. These results are in line with estimates proposed in a recent French national assessment concerning the potential of agricultural practices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Compared to recent literature, they further show that practices that increase C inputs to soil through additional biomass production would be more effective to store C in soil (tree rows, cover crops in conservation agriculture) than practices, such as no-tillage, that are assumed to reduce soil organic matter mineralisation rates. This questions our understanding of the stabilization processes of organic matter in soils and especially that of physical protection. The conditions and scale, both spatial and temporal, of physical protection of organic matter are discussed in light of recent literature...|$|E
40|$|A {{stumbling}} block {{to the adoption}} of <b>silvoarable</b> <b>agroforestry</b> systems is the lack of quantitative knowledge on the performance of different crops when competing for resources with trees. In North-Western Europe, light {{is likely to be the}} principal limiting resource for understorey crops, and most agronomic studies show a systematic reduction of final yield as shade increases. However the intensity of the crop response depends on both the environmental conditions and the shade characteristics. This study addressed the issue by monitoring winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) growth, productivity and quality under artificial shade provided by military camouflage shade-netting, and using the Hi-sAFe model to relate the artificial shade conditions to those applying in agroforestry systems. The field experiment was carried out over two consecutive years (2013 – 14 and 2014 – 15) on the experimental farm of Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech, Belgium. The shade structures recreated two shade conditions: periodic shade (PS) and continuous shade (CS), with the former using overlapping military camouflage netting to provide discontinuous light through the day, and the latter using conventional shade cloth. The experiment simulated shading from a canopy of late-flushing hybrid walnut leaves above winter wheat. Shading was imposed 16 (2013 – 14) and 10 (2014 – 15) days before flowering and retained until harvest. The crop experienced full light conditions until the maximum leaf area index stage (LAImax) had been reached. In both years, LAI followed the same dynamics between the different treatments, but in 2013 – 2014 an attack of the take-all disease (Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici) reduced yields overall and prevented significant treatment effects. In season 2014 – 15 the decrease in global radiation reaching the crop during a period of 66 days (CS: – 61 % and PS: – 43 %) significantly affected final yield (CS: – 45 % and PS: – 25 %), mainly through a reduction of the average grain weight and the number of grain per m 2. Grain protein content increased by up to 45 % under the CS treatment in 2015. Nevertheless, at the plot scale, protein yield (t/ha) did not compensate for the final grain yield decrease. The Hi-sAFe model was used to simulate an agroforestry plot with two lines of walnut trees running either north-south or east-west. The levels of artificial shade levels applied in this experiment were compared to those predicted beneath trees growing with similar climatic conditions in Belgium. The levels used in the CS treatment are only likely to occur real agroforestry conditions on 10 % of the cropped area until the trees are 30 years old and only with east-west tree row orientation.
