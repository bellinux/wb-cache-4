40|$|This paper {{explores the}} <b>structure</b> <b>groups</b> G_(X,r) of finite {{non-degenerate}} set-theoretic solutions (X,r) to the Yang-Baxter equation. Namely, we construct a finite quotient G_(X,r) of G_(X,r), generalizing the Coxeter-like groups introduced by Dehornoy for involutive solutions. This yields a finitary setting for testing injectivity: if X injects into G_(X,r), then it also injects into G_(X,r). We shrink every solution to an injective {{one with the}} same <b>structure</b> <b>group,</b> and compute the rank of the abelianization of G_(X,r). We show that multipermutation solutions are the only involutive solutions with diffuse structure group; that only free abelian <b>structure</b> <b>groups</b> are biorderable; and that for the <b>structure</b> <b>group</b> of a self-distributive solution, the following conditions are equivalent: biorderable, left-orderable, abelian, free abelian, torsion free.

50|$|In the loosest {{sense of}} group ownership, {{a lack of}} legal framework, rules and {{regulations}} may mean that group ownership of property places every member {{in a position of}} responsibility (liability) for the actions of each other member. A <b>structured</b> <b>group</b> duly constituted as an entity under law may still not protect members from being personally liable for each other's actions. Court decisions against the entity itself may give rise to unlimited personal liability for each and every member. An example of this situation is a professional partnership (e.g. law practice) in some jurisdictions. Thus, being a partner or owner in a group may give little advantage in terms of share ownership while producing a lot of risk to the partner, owner or participant.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} <b>structure</b> <b>group</b> of a {{canonical}} algebraic curvature tensor built from a symmetric bilinear form, {{and show that}} in most cases it coincides with the isometry group of the symmetric form from which it is built. Our main {{result is that the}} <b>structure</b> <b>group</b> of the direct sum of such canonical algebraic curvature tensors on a decomposable model space must permute the subspaces V_i on which they are defined. For such an algebraic curvature tensor, we show that if the vector space V is a direct sum of subspaces V_ 1 and V_ 2, the corresponding <b>structure</b> <b>group</b> decomposes as well if V_ 1 and V_ 2 are invariant of the action of the <b>structure</b> <b>group</b> on V. We determine the freedom one has in permuting these subspaces, and show these subspaces are invariant if V_ 1 ≠ V_ 2 or if the corresponding symmetric forms defined on those subspaces have different (but not reversed) signatures, so that in this situation, only the trivial permutation is allowable. We exhibit a model space that realizes the full permutation group, and, with exception to the balanced signature case, show the corresponding <b>structure</b> <b>group</b> is isomorphic to the wreath product of the <b>structure</b> <b>group</b> of a given symmetric bilinear form by the symmetric group. Using these results, we conclude that the <b>structure</b> <b>group</b> of any member of this family is isomorphic to a direct product of wreath products of pseudo-orthogonal groups by certain subgroups of the symmetric group. Finally, we apply our results to two families of manifolds to generate new isometry invariants that are not of Weyl type. Comment: Corey Dunn - Corresponding autho...|$|R
