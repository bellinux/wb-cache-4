40|$|Asphalt {{emulsion}} {{has been}} used for base material stabilization with Full Depth Reclamation (FDR) process for pavement rehabilitating in a few TxDOT districts. Results from these practices were quite different. The initial performance of two projects on US 287 constructed around 2000 in the Amarillo District {{has been found to be}} satisfactory. However, the Yoakum District has reported problems with asphalt emulsion for base work in a project. The preliminary conclusion from these is that it is not necessarily the emulsion or the mix design but the practice of construction. Considering that the use of asphalt emulsion is relatively new and in the experimental stage, results in inconsistent results from different construction practices implemented by contractors. TxDOT has drafted a <b>special</b> <b>specification</b> for the use of asphalt emulsions treatment in road mixing yet it does not specify a concrete protocol for field practice. On the other hand, contractors are currently using their experience as a guideline in construction. In this project, the trial version of the TxDOT <b>special</b> <b>specification,</b> is evaluated based on the results from laboratory and field tests. The output of this research project includes: laboratory mix designs for the materials obtained from a number of construction projects, a guideline for the construction of emulsion treated bases and results from a series of parametric studies that show which parameters may have significant impacts on the engineering properties of emulsion-treated base materials and on the performance of emulsion-treated bases. ...|$|R

40|$|Asphalt {{emulsion}} {{has been}} used for base material stabilization in a few TxDOT districts. Results from these practices were quite different. The initial performance of two projects on US 287 constructed around 2000 in the Amarillo District {{has been found to be}} satisfactory. However, the Yoakum District has reported problems with asphalt emulsion for base work in a project on FM 237. The preliminary conclusion from these trials has been that asphalt emulsion may not perform well in the high humidity/high rainfall areas like east Texas. On the other hand, using calcium-based additives to stabilize base courses in road construction has been a common practice in most TxDOT districts. It is expected that the blend of calcium-based additives with asphalt emulsion (dual stabilization) will produce a base which has an optimum combination of strength, stiffness, moisture resistance and flexibility. In this case, the calcium-based stabilizer may reduce the plasticity of the base fines making it a more friable material that accepts well the blending with emulsions. TxDOT has drafted a <b>special</b> <b>specification</b> for the use of asphalt emulsions treatment in road mixing. In this project, the trial version of the TxDOT <b>special</b> <b>specification</b> is evaluated.

To measure the bone density and the cortical thickness around the implants accurately, the CBCT scanning was performed immediately just after the formation of the implant cavity.

Two questions face pavement engineers who consider using Portland cement concrete (PCC) overlays over hot mix asphalt concrete (HMAC) : (1) Is the HMAC section in need of rehabilitation a good candidate for PCC overlay?
