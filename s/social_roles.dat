40|$|During {{the late}} 1960 s, Normalization and <b>Social</b> <b>Role</b> Valorization (SRV) enabled the {{widespread}} emergence of community residential options and then provided the philosophical climate within which educational integration, supported employment, and community participation {{were able to}} take firm root.

5|$|Most of humanity's oldest known archaeological constructions are tombs. Mostly megalithic, the {{earliest}} instances date {{to within a}} few centuries of each other, yet show a wide diversity of form and purpose. Tombs in the Iberian peninsula have been dated through thermoluminescence to c. 4510BCE, and some burials at the Carnac stones in Brittany also {{date back to the}} fifth millennium BCE. The commemorative value of such burial sites are indicated by the fact that, at some stage, they became elevated, and that the constructs, almost from {{the earliest}}, sought to be monumental. This effect was often achieved by encapsulating a single corpse in a basic pit, surrounded by an elaborate ditch and drain. Over-ground commemoration is thought to be tied to the concept of collective memory, and these early tombs were likely intended as a form of ancestor-worship, a development available only to communities that had advanced to the stage of settled livestock and formed <b>social</b> <b>roles</b> and relationships and specialized sectors of activity.|$|E
40|$|Basing their {{hypotheses}} on {{identity and}} life-course theories, the authors examine the <b>social</b> <b>role</b> identities {{of a group}} of older adults (N = 92) both before and after their move into a new continuing care retirement community (CCRC) to investigate whether this transition is linked to changes in <b>social</b> <b>role</b> identities. The congruence between actually enacting a role and choosing it as a role identity varies with the role. Current role behaviors and satisfaction predict role identity for two institutionalized, public roles (volunteer and church/synagogue member) but are less related to two more private roles (parent and friend). Cluster analysis reveals a typology of three dis-crete groups, based on <b>social</b> <b>role</b> identities: an involved group with a high number of role identities, a group focused on family roles identities, and a group focused on the friend <b>role</b> identity. The <b>social</b> <b>role</b> identities of the three groups changed in different ways after moving to the CCRC. <b>Social</b> <b>role</b> identities are key components of self-concept, perceptions locating individuals in the larger matrix of social relationships. These identities reflect the system of social positions held by an individual. But it is unclear as to whether identities reflect currently held roles, past roles, or roles expected to be taken on in the future. Moreover, this system of <b>social</b> <b>role</b> identities may well change during the life course...|$|R

5|$|Sociological {{reasoning}} pre-dates {{the foundation}} of the discipline. Social analysis has origins in the common stock of Western knowledge and philosophy, and has been carried out from {{as far back as the}} time of ancient Greek philosopher Plato, if not before. The origin of the survey, i.e., the collection of information from a sample of individuals, can be traced back to at least the Domesday Book in 1086, while ancient philosophers such as Confucius wrote on the importance of <b>social</b> <b>roles.</b> There is evidence of early sociology in medieval Arab writings. Some sources consider Ibn Khaldun, a 14th-century Arab Islamic scholar from North Africa (Tunisia), to have been the first sociologist and father of sociology (see Branches of the early Islamic philosophy); his Muqaddimah was perhaps the first work to advance social-scientific reasoning on social cohesion and social conflict.|$|E
5|$|To be {{considered}} a dictator novel, a story should have strong political themes drawn from history, a critical examination of the power held by the dictator, the caudillo, and some general reflection {{on the nature of}} authoritarianism. Although some dictator novels centre on one historical dictator (albeit in fictional guise), they do not analyze the economics, politics, and rule of the régime as might a history book. The dictator novel genre includes I, the Supreme (1974), by Augusto Roa Bastos, about Dr. Francia of Paraguay, and The Feast of the Goat (2000), by Mario Vargas Llosa, about Rafael Leónidas Trujillo of the Dominican Republic. Alternatively, the novelist might create a fictional dictator to achieve the same narrative end, as in Reasons of State (1974), by Alejo Carpentier, in which the dictator is a composite man assembled from historical dictators. The genre of the dictator novel has been very influential {{in the development of a}} Latin American literary tradition, because many of the novelists rejected traditional, linear story-telling techniques, and developed narrative styles that blurred the distinctions between reader, narrator, plot, characters, and story. In examining the authority of leadership, the novelists also assessed their own <b>social</b> <b>roles</b> as paternalistic dispensers of wisdom, like that of the caudillo whose régime they challenged in their dictator novels.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the anxiety and fear that typically accompanies OCD, sufferers may spend hours performing such compulsions every day.

25|$|The {{pattern of}} male and female {{aggression}} is argued to be consistent with evolved sexually-selected behavioral differences, while alternative or complimentary views emphasize conventional <b>social</b> <b>roles</b> stemming from physical evolved differences.
