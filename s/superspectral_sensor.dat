Feature selection (FS) is a possible strategy to re-duce the number of bands, consisting in selecting the most relevant bands for a classification problem. It is adapted {{to the design of}} <b>superspectral</b> <b>sensor</b> dedicated to specific ap-plications. FS is an optimization problem involving both a metric (that is to say a FS score or criterion measuring the relevance of feature subsets) to optimize and an optimization strategy. In this paper, a wrapper FS score based on Random Forests (RF) and taking into account RF class membership measures was proposed. It was compared to a state-of-the-art wrapper FS score (classification Kappa obtained by RF). Both were then evaluated quantitatively considering both classifi-cation performance reached applying different classifiers. An qualitative analysis was also performed to consider the sta-bility/regularity of the selected features along the spectrum. Even though the quantitative evaluation showed little differ-ences between the two tested FS criteria, {{there seemed to be a}} trend in favour of the proposed criterion. Taking into account the measures of class membership provided by a RF classifier slightly improved results, regularizing feature selection...|$|E
40|$|In urban areas, {{information}} concerning very high resolution land cover and especially material maps {{are necessary for}} several city modelling or monitoring applications. That is to say, knowledge concerning the roofing materials or {{the different kinds of}} ground areas is required. Airborne remote sensing techniques appear to be convenient for providing such information at a large scale. However, results obtained using most traditional processing methods based on usual red-green-blue-near infrared multispectral images remain limited for such applications. A possible way to improve classification results is to enhance the imagery spectral resolution using superspectral or hyperspectral sensors. In this study, it is intended to design a <b>superspectral</b> <b>sensor</b> dedicated to urban materials classification and this work particularly focused on the selection of the optimal spectral band subsets for such sensor. First, reflectance spectral signatures of urban materials were collected from 7 spectral libraires. Then, spectral optimization was performed using this data set. The band selection workflow included two steps, optimising first the number of spectral bands using an incremental method and then examining several possible optimised band subsets using a stochastic algorithm. The same wrapper relevance criterion relying on a confidence measure of Random Forests classifier was used at both steps. To cope with the limited number of available spectra for several classes, additional synthetic spectra were generated from the collection of reference spectra: intra-class variability was simulated by multiplying reference spectra by a random coefficient. At the end, selected band subsets were evaluated considering the classification quality reached using a rbf svm classifier. It was confirmed that a limited band subset was sufficient to classify common urban materials. The important contribution of bands from the Short Wave Infra-Red (SWIR) spectral domain (1000 - 2400 nm) to material classification was also shown...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSpectral {{optimization}} {{consists in}} identifying the most relevant band subset for a specific application. It {{is a way to}} reduce hyperspec-tral data huge dimensionality and can be applied to design specific <b>superspectral</b> <b>sensors</b> dedicated to specific land cover applications. Spectral optimization includes both band selection and band extraction. On the one hand, band selection aims at selecting an optimal band subset (according to a relevance criterion) among the bands of a hyperspectral data set, using automatic feature selection algorithms. On the other hand, band extraction defines the most relevant spectral bands optimizing both their position along the spectrum and their width. The approach presented in this paper first builds a hierarchy of groups of adjacent bands, according to a relevance criterion to decide which adjacent bands must be merged. Then, band selection is performed at the different levels of this hierarchy. Two approaches were proposed to achieve this task : a greedy one and a new adaptation of an incremental feature selection algorithm to this hierarchy of merged bands...|$|R
40|$|Humans {{directly}} alter surficial {{processes and}} climate {{at the local}} or “neighborhood ” scale (typically {{on the order of}} hundreds of hectares) where process- response is not well understood. Investigation of surficial processes at this scale requires very high resolution (both spatial and spectral) data over a wide wavelength range. Commercial data from satellite-based sensors such as IKONOS and Quickbird now provide excellent spatial resolution in the visible through near-infrared wavelengths; however data with high spectral and spatial resolution at longer wavelengths, particularly the mid-infrared, are still the province of multispectral to hyperspectral airborne <b>sensors.</b> <b>Superspectral</b> data acquired by the NASA MASTER airborne sensor is being used to investigate social-biogeophysical microclimate interactions in Phoenix, Arizona neighborhoods. This sensor acquires data in 50 bands in the visible through mid-infrared wavelengths, placed to match the bandpasses of the satellite-based MODIS and ASTER instruments. Ground resolution of data acquired over the Phoenix metropolitan region varies from 5 – 12 m/pixel depending on aircraft height. Surface temperature and vegetation density spatial variations between neighborhoods spaced along an income gradient in Phoenix have been mapped using 12 m/pixel data. These data correlate with ethnicity and income level, and demonstrate inequity in the microclimates experienced by Phoenix residents...|$|R
40|$|Image data {{sharpening}} is {{a challenging}} field of remote sensing science, {{which has become}} more relevant as high spatial-resolution satellites and superspectral sensors have emerged. Although the spectral property is crucial for mineral mapping, spatial resolution is also important as it allows targeted minerals/rocks to be identified/interpreted in a spatial context. Therefore, improving the spatial context, while keeping the spectral property provided by the <b>superspectral</b> <b>sensor,</b> would bring great benefits for geological/mineralogical mapping especially in arid environments. In this paper, a new concept was tested using superspectral data (ASTER) and high spatial-resolution panchromatic data (WorldView- 2) for image fusion. A modified Principal Component Analysis (PCA) -based sharpening method, which implements a histogram matching workflow {{that takes into account}} the real distribution of values, was employed to test whether the substitution of Principal Components (PC 1 –PC 4) can bring a fused image which is spectrally more accurate. The new approach was compared to those most widely used—PCA sharpening and Gram–Schmidt sharpening (GS), both available in ENVI software (Version 5. 2 and lower) {{as well as to the}} standard approach—sharpening Landsat 8 multispectral bands (MUL) using its own panchromatic (PAN) band. The visual assessment and the spectral quality indicators proved that the spectral performance of the proposed sharpening approach employing PC 1 and PC 2 improve the performance of the PCA algorithm, moreover, comparable or better results are achieved compared to the GS method. It was shown that, when using the PC 1, the visible-near infrared (VNIR) part of the spectrum was preserved better, however, if the PC 2 was used, the short-wave infrared (SWIR) part was preserved better. Furthermore, this approach improved the output spectral quality when fusing image data from different sensors (e. g., ASTER and WorldView- 2) while keeping the proper albedo scaling when substituting the second PC...|$|E
