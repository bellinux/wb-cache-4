However, these methods may not be directly applicable to pig diets because they did not use the successive incubation at different pH conditions similar to the intestinal environment of pigs.

40|$|Enterobactin, a {{microbial}} iron-transport compound {{which is}} a hexadentate ligand via its three catechol groups, has been studied by potentiometric, spectrophotometric and electrochemical techniques. The proton-dependent stability constant for the ferric enterobactin complex has been determined spectrophotometrically by competition vs EDTA. At physiological pH, enterobactin {{is by far the}} most powerful iron chelating agent yet characterized. In a biomimetic approach to the design and synthesis of ferric-ion-specific <b>sequestering</b> <b>agents</b> that could prove to be new therapeutic agents for iron mobilization in man, several structural analogs of enterobactin have been chosen as target compounds. Because of the large number of chemical and biological similarities of plutonium(IV) with iron(III) a biomimetic approach has also been taken in the synthesis of a new class of actinide-specific <b>sequestering</b> <b>agents</b> which incorporate four catechol groups. In general both the iron and actinide <b>sequestering</b> <b>agents</b> are derivatives of 2, 3 -dihydroxybenzoic acid or the 5 -sulfo 2, 3 -dihydroxybenzoic acid derivatives. Both MECAM [1, 3, 5 -N,N{prime},N{double_prime}-tris(2, 3 -dihydroxybenzoyl) triamino-methylbenzene] and 3, 4 -LICAMS [1, 5, 10 -N,N{prime},N{double_prime}-tris(5 -sulfo- 2, 3 -dihydroxybenzoyl) triazadecane] have been found to remove iron from the human iron transport protein transferrin. In fact, all of the synthetic tricatecholate ligands rapidly remove iron from human transferrin - in marked contrast to the trihydroxamate ligands such as desferrioxamine B (the most commonly used drug for iron removal in man). The details of the kinetics of transferrin iron removal by 3, 4 -LICAMS have been investigated. In addition, the mode of coordination to ferric ion of enterobactin and analogous compounds has been investigated and the change in this coordination as a function of protonation of the metal-ligand complex characterized. Protonation of these compounds occurs through one-proton steps to give a salicylate mode of bonding in which the carbonyl oxygen of the 2, 3 -dihydroxybenzoyl group coordinates to the metal. The solution thermodynamics of the complexes formed between the tetra-catechol <b>sequestering</b> <b>agents</b> and thorium(IV) have been investigated in a preliminary fashion and these <b>sequestering</b> <b>agents</b> have undergone animal tests for their efficacy in decorporation of plutonium. Two of these compounds have been found to be far superior at low concentration to any of the <b>sequestering</b> <b>agents</b> presently used in actinide contamination treatment...|$|R

50|$|There {{are several}} species of {{reducing}} microorganisms that produce indirect <b>sequestering</b> <b>agents</b> and specific chelators, such as siderophores. These <b>sequestering</b> <b>agents</b> are crucial in the complexation of radionuclides and increasing their solubility and bioavailability. Microbacterium flavescens, for example, grows {{in the presence of}} radioisotopes such as plutonium, thorium, uranium or americium and produces organic acids and siderophores that allow the dissolution and mobilization of radionuclides through the soil. It seems that siderophores on bacterial surface could also facilitate the entry of these elements within the cell as well. Pseudomonas aeruginosa also secretes chelating agents out that meet uranium and thorium when grown in a medium with these elements. In general, it has also been found that enterobactin siderophores are extremely effective in solubilizing actinide oxides of plutonium.|$|R

40|$|We here {{exploit the}} {{recently}} reported thermodynamic preference for poly(dAdT) (2) over mixed-sequence calf thymus (ct) DNA of two binuclear ruthenium complexes, Delta Delta-[mu-bidppz(bipy) (4) Ru- 2](4 +) (B) and Delta Delta-[mu-bidppz(phen) (4) Ru- 2](4 +) (P), that bind to DNA by threading intercalation, {{to determine their}} intrinsic dissociation rates. After adding poly(dAdT) (2) as a <b>sequestering</b> <b>agent</b> to B or P bound to ct-DNA, the observed rate of change in luminescence upon binding to the polynucleotide reflects the rate of dissociation from the mixed sequence. The activation parameters for the threading and dissociation rate constants allow us {{for the first time}} to characterize the thermodynamics of the exceedingly slow threading intercalation equilibrium of B and P with ct-DNA. The equilibrium is found to be endothermic by 33 and 76 kJ/mol, respectively, and the largest part of the enthalpy difference between the complexes originates from the forward threading step. At physiological temperature (37 degrees C) B and P have dissociation half-lives of 18 and 38 h, respectively. This is to our knowledge the slowest dissociating noncovalently bound DNA-drug reported. SDS sequestration is the traditional method for determination of rate constants for cationic drugs dissociating from DNA. However, the rates may be severely overestimated for slowly dissociating molecules due to unwanted catalysis by the SDS monomers and micelles. Having determined the intrinsic dissociation rates with poly(dAdT) (2) as <b>sequestering</b> <b>agent,</b> we find that the catalytic effect of SDS on the dissociation rate may be up to a factor of 60, and that the catalysis is entropy driven. A simple kinetic model for the SDS concentration dependence of the apparent dissociation rate suggests an intermediate that involves both micelles and DNA-threaded complex...|$|E
40|$|We have briefly {{reviewed}} the biological hazards {{associated with the}} actinide elements. The most abundant transuranium element produced by both industrial nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons programs is plutonium. It is also potentially the most toxic - particularly due to its long-term hazard as a carcinogen if it is introduced into the body. This toxicity is {{due in large part}} to the chemical and biochemical similarities of Pu(IV) and Fe(III). Thus in mammals plutonium is transported and stored by the transport and storage systems for iron. This results in the concentration and long-term retention of an alpha-emitting radionuclide ({sup 239 }Pu) at sites such as the bone marrow where cell division occurs at a high rate. The earliest attempts at removal of actinide contamination by chelation therapy were essentially heuristic in that <b>sequestering</b> <b>agents</b> known to be effective at binding other elements were tried with plutonium. The research described here is intended to be a rational approach that begins with the observation that since Fe(III) and Pu(IV) are so similar, and since microbes produce agents called siderophores that are extremely effective and selective <b>sequestering</b> <b>agents</b> for Fe(III), the construction of similar chelating agents for the actinides should be possible using the same chelating groups found in the siderophores. The incorporation of four such groups (primarily catechol and hydroxamic acid) results in multidentate chelating agents that can completely encapsulate the central actinide(IV) ion and achieve the eight-coordinate environment most favored by such ions. The continuing development and improvement of such <b>sequestering</b> <b>agents</b> has produced compounds which remove significant amounts of plutonium deposited in bone and which remove a greater fraction of the total body burden than any other chelation therapy developed to date...|$|R

Ten toxin binder products including 5 bentonite clays (bentonite A, B, C, D, and E), 2 cellulose products (cellulose A and B), a yeast cell wall, an activated charcoal, and a mixture product containing minerals, microorganisms, and phytogenic substances were used in this experiment. An in vitro procedure was used to mimic the digestive process in pigs. The binding ability for AFB 1 of the cellulose products was less compared with the values of other sequestering products (p[*]<[*] 0.05). The percent adsorption of AFB 1 by bentonite clays, cellulose products, yeast cell wall product, activated charcoal product, and the mixture product were 92.5 (average of 5 bentonite products), − 13.5 (average of 2 cellulose products), 92.7, 100.2, and 96.6, respectively.
