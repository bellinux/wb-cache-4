5|$|Compressor diving is a {{rudimentary}} method of surface-supplied diving {{used in some}} tropical regions such as the Philippines and the Caribbean. The divers swim with a half mask and fins and are supplied with air from an industrial low-pressure air compressor on the boat through plastic tubes. There is no reduction valve; the diver holds the hose end in his mouth with no demand valve or mouthpiece and allows excess air to <b>spill</b> <b>out</b> between the lips.|$|E
5|$|A lake (from Latin lacus) is a terrain feature (or {{physical}} feature), a body {{of liquid}} {{on the surface of}} a world that is localized to the bottom of basin (another type of landform or terrain feature; that is, it is not global) and moves slowly if it moves at all. On Earth, {{a body of}} water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the ocean, is larger and deeper than a pond, and is fed by a river. The only world other than Earth known to harbor lakes is Titan, Saturn's largest moon, which has lakes of ethane, most likely mixed with methane. It is not known if Titan's lakes are fed by rivers, though Titan's surface is carved by numerous river beds. Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing or recent glaciation. Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last Ice Age. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or <b>spill</b> <b>out</b> of the basin containing them.|$|E

25|$|If seriously stimulated or gripped, lasiocampid larvae {{are likely}} to lash about, forcing the {{stinging}} hairs into any vulnerable organ within reach. Many other species of larvae lack any such localized concentrations of hairs and are armed more generally with urticating hairs; even so, they too will lash about frantically if disturbed, making them difficult to handle without suitable equipment. Toxins from the broken hairs may <b>spill</b> <b>out,</b> causing dermatitis {{on the surface of}} the skin.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to necrosis, {{which is a}} form of traumatic cell death that results from acute cellular injury, apoptosis is a highly regulated and controlled process that confers advantages during an organism's lifecycle. For example, the separation of fingers and toes in a developing human embryo occurs because cells between the digits undergo apoptosis. Unlike necrosis, apoptosis produces cell fragments called apoptotic bodies that phagocytic cells are able to engulf and quickly remove before the contents of the cell can <b>spill</b> <b>out</b> onto surrounding cells and cause damage to the neighboring cells.|$|E

25|$|In {{fighting}} {{a fire at}} a directly vertical spewing wellhead, high explosives, such as dynamite were {{used to create a}} blast wave that pushes the burning fuel and local atmospheric oxygen away from the well. (This is a similar principle to blowing out a candle.) The flame is removed and the fuel can continue to <b>spill</b> <b>out</b> without igniting. Generally, explosives were placed within 55 gallon drums, the explosives surrounded by fire retardant chemicals, and then the drums are wrapped with insulating material with a horizontal crane being used to bring the drum as close to the burning area as possible.|$|E
25|$|Later, {{the area}} became Radio Row. New York City's Radio Row, which existed from 1921 to 1966, was a {{warehouse}} district on the Lower West Side in the Financial District. Harry Schneck opened City Radio on Cortlandt Street in 1921, {{and eventually the}} area held several blocks of electronics stores, with Cortlandt Street as its central axis. The used radios, war surplus electronics (e.g., ARC-5 radios), junk, and parts often piled so high they would <b>spill</b> <b>out</b> onto the street, attracting collectors and scroungers. According to a business writer, it also was {{the origin of the}} electronic component distribution business.|$|E
25|$|When a tooth {{is picked}} up, it {{should always be}} grasped by the enamel on the crown. Finger {{pressure}} on the tooth root cells will cause cell crushing. Any attempt to clean off any debris should be avoided. Debris should always be washed off gently with, at the very least, a physiologic saline. Even {{with the use of}} a physiologic saline, the “scrubbing” of the tooth root to remove debris must be avoided. When placed in a physiologic solution, the tooth should be gently agitated to permit the cleansing of the tooth root. At the same time that this agitation occurs, the bumping of the tooth root against a hard surface such as glass, plastic or even cardboard must also be avoided. For the same reasons, the method in which the knocked-out teeth are transported must be carefully selected. Placing the knocked-out teeth in transporting vehicles such as tissues and handkerchiefs can be damaging and transporting them in glass or cardboard containers can also be potentially damaging to the cells. In addition to the potential damage that the hard surface can cause, glass containers have the added possibility of breakage or leakage of the physiologic storage fluid. If the glass container does not have a tightly fitting top, then during the transportation, the physiologic storage solution can <b>spill</b> <b>out</b> and the teeth can fall, once again, on the floor and, at the same time, be out of a physiologic environment.|$|E

500|$|The {{area around}} the Bastille was {{transformed}} in the reign of Louis XIV. Paris' growing population reached 400,000 during the period, causing the city to <b>spill</b> <b>out</b> past the Bastille and the old city into the arable farmland beyond, forming more thinly populated [...] "faubourgs", or suburbs. Influenced {{by the events of}} the Fronde, Louis XIV rebuilt the {{area around the}} Bastille, erecting a new archway at the Porte Saint-Antoine in 1660, and then ten years later pulling down the city walls and their supporting fortifications to replace them with an avenue of trees, later called Louis XIV's boulevard, which passed around the Bastille. The Bastille's bastion survived the redevelopment, becoming a garden {{for the use of the}} prisoners.|$|E
500|$|However, Jonathan Rosenbaum {{wrote in}} the Chicago Reader: [...] "To be sure, The Big Lebowski is packed with show-offy filmmaking {{and as a result}} is pretty entertaining. But insofar as it {{represents}} a moral position–and the Coens' relative styling of their figures invariably does–it's an elitist one, elevating salt-of-the-earth types like Bridges and Goodman ... over everyone else in the movie." [...] Dave Kehr, in his review for the Daily News, criticized the film's premise as a [...] "tired idea, and it produces an episodic, unstrung film". The Guardian criticized the film as [...] "a bunch of ideas shoveled into a bag and allowed to <b>spill</b> <b>out</b> at random. The film is infuriating, and will win no prizes.

500|$|In 2008, in Germany, a 23-year-old {{woman in}} her third {{trimester}} {{was involved in a}} motor vehicle accident, and died; the non-viable fetus was found between her feet. The vehicle caught fire following initial impact [...] The woman was unable to escape due to internal injuries and burned to death. Investigators {{came to the conclusion that}} the extreme heat of the fire burned away epidermal and subcutaneous tissue around the abdominal cavity, after which the anterior aspect of the uterus ruptured, causing the fetus to <b>spill</b> <b>out</b> of the uterine cavity and land on the floor between the woman's feet. The umbilical cord was still intact and connected the fetus to the placenta through the ruptured wall of the uterus. Unlike the woman, who suffered fourth-degree burns over her entire body, the body of the fetus was relatively undamaged. Because the primary cause of separation from the mother's body was thermally induced traumatic rupture of the abdominal and uterine cavities; traumatic separation was not related to normal decompositional processes; and expulsion of the fetus did not involve passage through the birth canal, this is not considered a case of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E

500|$|Bell {{said that}} at first Anna was written plainer and more general. [...] "In {{the first draft of}} the script she was written more, in my opinion, prissy. She was kind of {{specific}} and very girly," [...] which Bell didn't find appealing. She admitted that she had always {{wanted to be part of}} Disney animated feature, but she [...] "wanted to be a very specific type of princess", who [...] "was way more awkward than the normal princesses", not someone with too good postures or too well-spoken. As she was offered the role of Anna, she came up with a lot of suggestions for the directors. They were responsive and allowed the actress to mould the character the way she wanted, since they wanted the film to be truthful. Bell significantly made specific changes to Anna, including the infusion and incorporation of the actress' own personality to the character, [...] embodying a relatable heroine, which received full support from the directors. She called the scene where Anna first meets Hans is a [...] "typical Disney moment", as they come too close physically and find out that they both fall in love with each other. Bell wanted Anna's words to reflect what she herself would say in real life, which included some [...] "nonsensical rambling". [...] "I think I said, [...] "This is awkward. You're not awkward. Me, I'm awkward. You're gorgeous. Wait—what?" [...] Words just <b>spill</b> <b>out</b> of her mouth too quickly and she has to backtrack." [...] Bell continued. Or the whole scene where she wakes up in the beginning with saliva all over the face, Bell [...] "wanted her to also have hair in her mouth", which took inspiration from her own real life. [...] "Sometimes I wake up like that. Then you have hair in your mouth, and you start coughing. The animators totally got what I was trying to do. It's cool, and way more fun when stuff is realistic like that, instead of the perfection of waking up with mascara on." [...] Anna's snorting and tripping over also drew inspirations from Bell's real life. Bell's recording sessions were also videotaped to assist in animating the character, and animators took into considerations even subtle things like the actress' biting her lip a lot. According to director Jennifer Lee, Anna is a bit flawed.|$|E
