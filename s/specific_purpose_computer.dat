40|$|We {{calculate}} the integrated trace anomaly {{for a real}} spin- 0 scalar field in six dimensions in a torsionless curved space without a boundary. We use a path integral approach for a corresponding supersymmetric quantum mechanical model. Weyl ordering the corresponding Hamiltonian in phase space, an extra two-loop counterterm 1 / 8 (R + g^ijΓ^l_k iΓ^k_l j) is produced in the action. Applying a recursive method we evaluate {{the components of the}} metric tensor in Riemann normal coordinates in six dimensions and construct the interaction Langrangian density by employing the background field method. The calculation of the anomaly is based on the end-point scalar propagator and not on the string inspired center-of-mass propagator which gives incorrect results for the local trace anomaly. The manipulation of the Feynman diagrams is partly relied on the factorization of four dimensional subdiagrams and partly on a brute force computer algebra program developed to serve this <b>specific</b> <b>purpose.</b> The <b>computer</b> program enables one to perform index contractions of twelve quantum fields (10395 in the present case) a task which cannot be accomplished otherwise. We observe that the contribution of the disconnected diagrams is no longer proportional to the two dimensional trace anomaly (which vanishes in four dimensions). The integrated trace anomaly is finally expressed in terms of the 17 linearly independent scalar monomials constructed out of covariant derivatives and Riemann tensors.

40|$|This paper {{discussed}} {{a model of}} syllabus design for Arabic for <b>specific</b> <b>purposes</b> (Arabic for military journalism). Arabic for <b>Specific</b> <b>Purposes</b> (ASP) failed to meet its objectives due to the shortage of teaching references including syllabus and curriculum specification, teaching methods, teaching techniques, and strategies besides, the lack of the expertise considered as a main factor may led to those problems. However, the development of syllabus design in Arabic for military journalism relies on English for <b>Specific</b> <b>Purposes</b> entirely in term of element or criteria for it experienced on specific language learning and teaching for more than 40 years. Consequently, the research tried to design a model of Arabic for <b>Specific</b> <b>purposes.</b> Students’ need is prime criteria {{that should be considered}} before designing the syllabus for Arabic for <b>Specific</b> <b>purposes,</b> besides the characteristics of ASP.
