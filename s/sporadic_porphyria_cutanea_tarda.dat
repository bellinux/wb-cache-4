40|$|Porphyria cutanea tarda is a {{disorder}} of porphyrin metabolism, of which familial and sporadic forms have been described. Factors such as iron seem necessary for {{porphyria cutanea tarda}} to become clinically manifest. To study the relationship between iron and uroporphyrins in hepatocytes of patients with porphyria cutanea tarda, a morphological and morphometrical study was performed in 13 liver biopsies of patients with porphyria cutanea tarda (eight with <b>sporadic</b> <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda</b> and five with {{familial porphyria cutanea tarda}}). In addition, possible differences in clinical and biochemical features and in histopathological findings between patients with <b>sporadic</b> <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda</b> and familial porphyria cutanea tarda were investigated. Familial porphyria cutanea tarda patients presented at a younger age than <b>sporadic</b> <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda</b> patients (42. 4 +/- 5. 3 vs. 57. 3 +/- 8. 6 years). Biochemical features were not different between <b>sporadic</b> <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda</b> and familial porphyria cutanea tarda patients. Uroporphyrin crystals and a variable degree of liver siderosis were detected in the biopsies of all 13 patients. Uroporphyrin crystals were often found close to ferritin-like iron deposits. The morphometrical analysis showed that an increased mean area fraction of ferritin iron was associated with an increased mean area fraction of uroporphyrin crystals in hepatocytes of <b>sporadic</b> <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda</b> and familial porphyria cutanea tarda patients. Moreover, the amount of uroporphyrin crystals was significantly higher in livers of familial porphyria cutanea tarda than <b>sporadic</b> <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda</b> patients. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that uroporphyria is precipitated by an iron-dependent process. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E

40|$|Porphyria cutanea tarda is a {{skin disease}} caused by {{photosensitization}} by porphyrins whose accumulation {{is caused by}} deficiency of hepatic uroporphyrin- ogen decarboxylase activity.

40|$|Inherited {{disorders}} of iron metabolism. Recent molecular {{studies have}} resulted in the identification of genetic alterations underlying hereditary disorders of iron metabolism. One example is the discovery of the HFE gene that is mutated in patients suffering from hereditary hemochromatosis. This autosomal recessive disorder has an estimated carrier frequency that varies between 0. 07 and 0. 13, thus representing {{one of the most common}} genetically determined metabolic disorders. The identification of the hemochromatosis mutations has encouraged efforts to investigate other conditions with iron overload for a putative interaction with these genetic variants. Few data are already available suggesting, for example, that iron overload in patients with <b>sporadic</b> <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda</b> is associated with mutations in the hereditary hemochromatosis gene. However, it is obvious that disorders of iron metabolism have a multifactorial pathogenesis, including environmental and genetic factors.

We analyzed the distribution of transferrin saturation values in the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to estimate {{the prevalence of}} hemochromatosis heterozygotes in the US population.

Twenty-five percent of the animals receiving ethanol increased up to 14 -, 25 -, and 4. 5 -fold the urinary excretion of delta-aminolevulinate, porphobilinogen, and porphyrins, respectively. Ethanol exacerbated the precursor excretions elicited by hexachlorobenzene. Hepatic porphyrin levels increased by hexachlorobenzene treatment, while this parameter only increased (up to 90 -fold) in some of the animals that received ethanol alone. Ethanol reduced the activities of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, delta-aminolevulinate dehydrase and ferrochelatase. In the ethanol group, many of the animals showed a 30 % decrease in uroporphyrinogen activity; in the ethanol + hexachlorobenzene group, this decrease occurred before the one caused by hexachlorobenzene alone. Ethanol exacerbated the effects of hexachlorobenzene, among others, on the rate-limiting enzyme delta-aminolevulinate synthetase. The plasma activities of enzymes that are markers of hepatic damage were similar in all drug-treated groups. These results indicate that 1) ethanol exacerbates the biochemical manifestation of sporadic hexachlorobenzene-induced porphyria cutanea tarda; 2) ethanol per se affects several enzymatic and excretion parameters of the heme metabolic pathway; 3) since not all the animals were affected to the same extent, ethanol seems to be a porphyrinogenic agent only when there is a predisposition, and 4) hepatic damage showed no correlation with the development of porphyria cutanea tarda...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda</b> is {{the most}} common form of porphyria, {{characterized}} by the decreased activity of the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase enzyme. Several reports associated HFE gene mutations of hereditary hemochromatosis with <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda</b> worldwide, although up to date only one study has been conducted in Brazil. OBJECTIVES: Investigation of <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda</b> association with C 282 Y and H 63 D mutations in the HFE gene. Identification of precipitating factors (hepatitis C, HIV, alcoholism and estrogen) and their link with HFE mutations. METHODS: An ambispective study of 60 patients with PCT was conducted during the period from 2003 to 2012. Serological tests for hepatitis C and HIV were performed and histories of alcohol abuse and estrogen intake were investigated. HFE mutations were identified with real-time PCR. RESULTS: <b>Porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda</b> predominated in males and alcohol abuse was the main precipitating factor. Estrogen intake was the sole precipitating factor present in 25 % of female patients. Hepatitis C was present in 41. 7 %. All HIV-positive patients (15. 3 %) had a history of alcohol abuse. Allele frequency for HFE mutations, i. e., C 282 Y (p = 0. 0001) and H 63 D (p = 0. 0004), were significantly higher in <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda</b> patients, compared to control group. HFE mutations had no association with the other precipitating factors.

40|$|A {{deficiency}} in uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) enzyme activity, the fifth enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway, {{is found in}} patients with <b>sporadic</b> <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda</b> (s-PCT), {{familial porphyria cutanea tarda}} (f-PCT), and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (HEP). Subnormal UROD activity is due to mutations of the UROD gene in both f-PCT and HEP, but no mutations have been found in s-PCT. Genetic analysis has determined that f-PCT is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. In contrast, HEP, a severe form of cutaneous porphyria, is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait. HEP is characterized by a profound deficiency of UROD activity, and the disease is usually manifest in childhood. In this study, a strategy was designed to identify alleles responsible for the HEP phenotype in three unrelated families. Mutations of UROD were identified by direct sequencing of four amplified fragments that contained the entire coding sequence of the UROD gene. Two new missense mutations were observed at the homoallelic state: P 62 L (proline-to-leucine substitution at codon 62) in a Portuguese family and Y 311 C (tyrosine-to-cysteine substitution at codon 311) in an Italian family. A third mutation, G 281 E, was observed in a Spanish family. This mutation has been previously described in three families from Spain and one from Tunisia. In the Spanish family described in this report, a paternal uncle of the proband developed clinically overt PCT as an adult and proved to be heterozygous for the G 281 E mutation.

40|$|Both {{familial}} and <b>sporadic</b> <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda</b> (PCT) are iron dependent diseases. Symptoms of PCT resolve when iron {{stores are}} depleted by phlebotomy, and a sequence variant of HFE (C 282 Y, c. 843 G>A, rs 1800562) that enhances iron aborption by reducing hepcidin expression {{is a risk}} factor for PCT. Recently, a polymorphic variant (D 519 G, c. 1556 A>G, rs 11558492) of glyceronephosphate O-acyltransferase (GNPAT) was shown to be enriched in male patients with type I hereditary hemochromatosis (HFE C 282 Y homozygotes) who presented with a high iron phenotype, suggesting that GNPAT D 519 G, like HFE C 282 Y, is a modifier of iron homeostasis that favors iron absorption. To challenge this hypothesis, we investigated the frequency of GNPAT D 519 G in patients with both familial and sporadic PCT. Patients were screened for GNPAT D 519 G and allelic variants of HFE (both C 282 Y and H 63 D). Nucleotide sequencing of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (URO-D) identified mutant alleles. Patients with low erythrocyte URO-D activity or a damaging URO-D variant were classified as familial PCT (fPCT) and those with wild-type URO-D were classified as sporadic PCT (sPCT). GNPAT D 519 G was significantly enriched in the fPCT patient population (p = 0. 0014) but not in the sPCT population (p = 0. 4477).

Methods : The PCT cases were retrieved from computerized databases. Patient files lacking information {{on the presence of}} concomitant liver disease were excluded from further analysis. Results : 29 PCT patients were retrieved from our databases, of which 17 patients with sPCT were retained for further analysis. Patients were middle aged (mean age: 43 3) and there was no gender difference (10 males vs. 7 females). Almost all patients had iron overload (14 / 17). 5 patients had chronic HCV, with type 1 b in 3 of them, 7 abused alcohol, 4 patients had hereditary haemochromatosis (3 homozygous C 282 Y - 1 heterozygous H 63 D/C 282 Y). In 3 patients sPCT was associated with medication intake and one patient had chronic hepatitis B (HBV). 13 patients were treated with phlebotomies, with success in 11 / 13. 4 patients were treated with chloroquine, 3 of which also underwent phlebotomies. Of the 5 patients with HCV, 3 were successfully treated with combined antiviral therapy; one of them is planned to be treated; one patient never received therapy and was lost from follow-up.

40|$|Although {{many studies}} have {{examined}} the regulation of transferrin, transferrin receptor and ferritin subunit gene expression in experimental systems, no molecular biological data in humans have been documented to date. In this study we simultaneously analyzed the hepatic content of transferrin, transferrin receptor and heavy and light ferritin subunit messenger RNAs in tissue samples obtained from subjects with normal iron balance and patients with primary or secondary iron overload. Steady-state levels of transferrin messenger RNA were not depressed by iron overload. On the contrary, they were increased (p 200 -mu-mol/gm dry wt) as compared with the control group. This indicates that, as already suggested by our previous data in experimental siderosis, iron maintains the ability to induce transferrin gene activity even when cellular iron content is significantly increased. Transferrin receptor gene expression was found to respond in the same manner to any cause of iron-tissue load, regardless of the cause. In fact, a lower signal for transferrin receptor messenger RNA was consistently detected in iron-overloaded patients vs. control subjects, particularly in patients with thalassemia major and idiopathic hemochromatosis (p < 0. 001). Ferritin light-subunit messenger RNA accumulation was significantly increased in those patients with severe siderosis (idiopathic hemochromatosis and thalassemia major = liver iron between 200 and 600 -mu-mol/gm dry wt). The fact that no significant change in hepatic ferritin heavy-subunit gene expression was detected in iron-loaded patients confirms preferential production of light-subunit-enriched ferritins in long-term iron overload. In addition, our data indicate that, in conditions where liver-specific abnormalities of iron-regulated proteins have been suggested (i. e., idiopathic hemochromatosis and <b>sporadic</b> <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda),</b> the hepatic control of human iron metabolism, as inferred by the activity of transferrin, transferrin receptor and ferritin genes, is normal...|$|E

PCT is frequently associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, which is in turn associated with autoimmune manifestations. To investigate whether autoimmune reactions, possibly triggered by HCV, are {{involved in the}} pathogenesis of PCT, we measured by immunoblot autoantibodies to human cytosolic and microsomal liver fractions in 82 patients with PCT (77 % with HCV infection), 105 with other liver disorders and 40 healthy subjects. Anti-liver cytosolic antibodies were more frequent in PCT patients (38 / 82, 46 %) than in pathological controls (P < 0 · 05 –P < 0 · 001) or in healthy subjects (3 / 40, 8 %, P < 0 · 001). Among PCT patients, anticytosolic antibodies were more frequent in HCV positive (36 / 63, 57 %) than in HCV negative (2 / 19, 11 %, P < 0 · 05) cases. Reactivity to a 40 -kDa cytosolic polypeptide was present in 20 PCT patients (19 HCV positive), being more frequent than in all pathological controls (P < 0 · 01 –P < 0 · 0001). Histological activity index (P = 0 · 04) and antibodies to HCV (P = 0 · 027) – but not HCV RNA – were associated independently with anticytosolic antibodies as assessed by multivariate analysis. In contrast, frequency of antiliver microsomal antibodies was similar in PCT patients (24 / 82, 29 %) and pathological controls (8 – 26 %), being higher in the autoimmune hepatitis control group (23 / 23, 100 %, P < 0 · 0001).

40|$|The {{need for}} {{accurate}} and noninvasive evaluation of liver iron stores prompted us {{to evaluate the}} reliability of high-field magnetic resonance imaging equipment in liver patients with low or moderate siderosis, given the poor results obtained using systems operating at low field strength in such cases. Twenty patients with <b>sporadic</b> <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda</b> and 28 with comparable chronic liver diseases (chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis) and moderate siderosis were compared with 10 patients with idiopathic or secondary hemochromatosis and 10 healthy controls. Plasma iron profile, ferritin concentration and liver iron concentration, determined with atomic absorption spectroscopy, were matched with the magnetic resonance parameters-namely, transverse relaxation time and the signal intensity for a given proton amount, obtained with equipment operating at a field strength of 1. 5 T. Hemochromatosis patients with mean liver iron concentrations of 550 mumol/gm dry wt (vs. 10 mumol of controls) exhibited an impressive reduction in the signal intensity {{with respect to the}} other three groups, and this reduction prevented any further comparison with the same porphyria cutanea tarda and chronic liver disease groups, whose liver iron level was twice that of the controls. The signal intensity remained almost unchanged in the latter groups, whereas the transverse relaxation time was significantly reduced. Moreover, correlation with liver iron was significantly inverse {{in the case of the}} transverse relaxation time (n = 17, r = 0. 62, p = 0. 008) and direct in the case of the transverse relaxation rate. The transverse relaxation time values returned to normal in five patients who had completed an iron-depletion program. No significant relationships between porphyrinuria (in porphyria cutanea tarda patients) or associated histological lesions (steatosis or inflammation) and the signal intensity or the transverse relaxation time were observed. We conclude that a magnetic resonance imaging system operating at higher field strength (with respect to previous studies) represents a useful, non-invasive diagnostic tool for the evaluation of even modest liver iron overload. Under these conditions, the decrease in the transverse relaxation time is proportional to the decrease in iron. Hemochromatosis cannot be investigated under the same conditions...|$|E
