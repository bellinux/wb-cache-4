5|$|Also in Arcadia, a Motel 6 {{was badly}} damaged. Other {{structural}} damage {{resulted from the}} shock. For example, both Monrovia and Pasadena each {{had more than a}} dozen buildings that were uninhabitable, {{but for the most part}} damage was limited to cracked plaster and broken windows. The Pasadena City Hall had moderate damage consisting of a cracked wall, dislodged marble barriers in the restrooms, and an offset dome. In <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre,</b> four apartment buildings and nine homes were also tagged as uninhabitable. Of the more than 100 injuries that were reported in Arcadia, Pasadena, Glendale, and <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre,</b> most were cuts, bruises, and sprains, but some serious injuries also occurred.|$|E
5|$|The {{littoral}} zone of Soconusco lies {{to the south}} of the <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre</b> de Chiapas, and consists of a narrow coastal plain and the foothills of the <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre.</b> Although the entire coastal strip {{is often referred to as}} Soconusco, Soconusco proper is the southeastern portion characterised by a humid tropical climate and rich agricultural lands. The northwestern portion of the coastal strip featuring a drier climate was historically referred to as El Despoblado ("The Unpopulated"); it is generally referred to now as the Isthmus Coast Region (Spanish: Istmo-Costa).|$|E
5|$|The {{littoral}} zone of Soconusco lies {{to the south}} of the <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre</b> de Chiapas, and consists of a narrow coastal plain and the foothills of the <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre.</b> The Maya highlands extend eastwards from Chiapas into Guatemala, reaching their highest in the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes. The major pre-Columbian population centres of the highlands were located in the largest highland valleys, such as the Valley of Guatemala and the Quetzaltenango Valley. In the southern highlands, a belt of volcanic cones runs parallel to the Pacific coast. The highlands extend northwards into Verapaz, and gradually descend to the east.|$|E

5|$|As {{the storm}} {{continued}} inland, it rapidly weakened and apparently dissipated over the <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre</b> Occidental. The storm apparently passed into Chihuahua and was predicted to continue into the southern United States, though {{the remainder of}} its path is unknown.|$|E
5|$|One study {{published}} in 2003 suggested that curve-billed speciation was due to climate, which {{could be explained by}} molt and feather wear. The same study suggested that the <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre</b> Occidental acts as a barrier to initiate differentiation within the species.|$|E
5|$|The {{conquest of}} Takalik Abaj broke the ancient trade routes {{running along the}} Pacific coast from Mexico to El Salvador, these were {{replaced}} by a new route running up the <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre</b> and into the northwestern Guatemalan highlands.|$|E
50|$|By land, Palanan {{can also}} be reached by hiking over the <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madres</b> from San Mariano, Isabela, which could take about three to five days.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madres</b> give hope to {{many other}} {{threatened}} animals by providing {{one of the largest}} areas of intact rainforest in the Philippines thereby maintaining the naturally high level of biodiversity. Many species of threatened birds are found in this location.|$|R
5|$|In September 1841, Hermano Pule {{traveled}} from Manila to Bay, Laguna {{to meet with}} the cofradía members that evaded capture. Anticipating an imminent attack, Pule and Purgatorio rallied 4,000 followers at Barrio Isabang on the slopes of Mount Banahaw. A group of pagan Aetas from <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre</b> also allied themselves with the cofradía.|$|E
5|$|The Wachowskis asked Joe Pantoliano {{to watch}} John Huston's The Treasure of the <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre</b> and {{to focus on}} Humphrey Bogart's {{character}} in order to prepare the paranoia of Caesar. Gershon's influences for her role were James Dean, Marlon Brando and Clint Eastwood. Both Gershon and Tilly were nervous about filming the sex scenes and prepared by drinking tequila.|$|E
5|$|Further {{strengthening}} {{was expected}} by forecasters, {{but did not}} come. The storm's motion slowed, and the center began wobbling erratically toward the coast. The storm made landfall around 11:00UTC on July20 near San Fernando in Tamaulipas. The storm had sustained winds of 125mph (200km/h), Category3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. After heading inland over northeast Mexico, it dissipated over the <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre</b> Oriental on July21.|$|E
50|$|Based on archaeological and ethno {{historical}} {{study in}} eastern Guerrero since 1998, an important network of roads through the <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madres</b> of Guerrero has been identified. These roads connected the settlements in Morelos and Puebla to the longer Pacific Coast communication and trade route.|$|R

5|$|Texas is {{the southernmost}} {{part of the}} Great Plains, which ends in the south against the folded <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre</b> Occidental of Mexico. The {{continental}} crust forms a stable Mesoproterozoic craton which changes across a broad continental margin and transitional crust into true oceanic crust of the Gulf of Mexico. The oldest rocks in Texas date from the Mesoproterozoic and are about 1,600 million years old.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{conquest of}} Chiapas was the {{campaign}} {{undertaken by the}} Spanish conquistadores against the Late Postclassic Mesoamerican polities in the territory that is now incorporated into the modern Mexican state of Chiapas. The region is physically diverse, featuring a number of highland areas, including the <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre</b> de Chiapas and the Montañas Centrales (Central Highlands), a southern littoral plain known as Soconusco and a central depression formed by the drainage of the Grijalva River.|$|E
5|$|The best decade for January movies, Burr writes, {{may well}} have been the 1940s. It began with what he {{suggests}} was best January in cinema history. The Grapes of Wrath, His Girl Friday and The Shop Around the Corner, all considered classics, were released in January 1940. Later in the decade, other classic films would first reach screens during January, such as Sullivan's Travels, Shadow of a Doubt and The Treasure of the <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre.</b>|$|E
50|$|In some areas, annual {{rainfall}} can {{be about}} quadruple what the lowland rainforests receive (as high as 10,000 mm). The <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madres</b> have very mild seasons, {{with a slight}} dry period between December and April. The Zambales Mountains and northern Central Cordillera highlands are more strongly seasonal with a longer dry period and slightly less rainfall generally.|$|R
5000|$|According to one source, [...] "Neither {{the number}} of wagons nor {{the number of}} people that {{eventually}} used this road to cross the <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madres</b> makes this trail significant. What makes this road unique is that Native Americans and their traveling companions did not just cross the Continental Divide; they made a path over the mountains and through the Wyoming Basin." ...|$|R

5|$|After the Attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the Screen Writers Guild {{set up on}} December 8, 1941, the Hollywood Writers Mobilization, a body to {{organize}} writers for the war effort. Rossen served as the body's chairman until 1944 and advocated {{the opening of a}} Second Front to support West European resistance against the Nazis. His earnings were much greater than in 1937. However, his work for Hollywood Writers Mobilization and for the Communist Party forced him to abandon some partly developed film projects, including The Treasure of the <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre,</b> which John Huston eventually directed in 1948.|$|E
5|$|Farther inland, Arlene {{turned to}} the west-southwest along the {{building}} ridge. The storm decreased in strength upon doing so; its mid- and low-level circulations became increasingly decoupled, with the latter turning elongated and ill-defined. Early on July1, the NHC downgraded Arlene to a tropical depression, and the cyclone dissipated over the high terrain of the <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre</b> Mountains shortly thereafter. Arlene's remnants continued to produce heavy precipitation over central Mexico, and with high air pressures offshore a tight pressure gradient generated a strong easterly breeze along the country's Pacific coastlines.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Henriette then emerged {{over the}} Gulf of California, and made its second {{landfall}} near Guaymas, Sonora. After causing heavy rains in Sonora, the storm dissipated over the <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre</b> Occidental and its remnants {{went on to}} cause flooding in New Mexico and Texas. Damage totaled about $275million (2007MXN, $25million 2007USD). It hit Mexico {{on the same day}} Hurricane Felix hit Nicaragua, only one of two occurrences in which a North Atlantic hurricane and a Pacific hurricane made landfall on the same day.|$|E
50|$|Kinkajous {{range from}} {{east and south}} of the <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madres</b> in Mexico, {{throughout}} Central America to Bolivia east of the Andes and the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil. Their altitudinal range is from sea level to 2500 m. They are found in closed-canopy tropical forests, including lowland rainforest, montane forest, dry forest, gallery forest and secondary forest. Deforestation is thus a potential threat to the species.|$|R
50|$|The park is {{characterized}} by high mountains with very steep slopes in the central portion of the range and relatively low hills with dominantly moderate steep slopes towards the coast. Mount Cresta on <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre's</b> western flank is the highest peak in the park with an elevation of 1672 m. The second highest is Mount Divilacan with an elevation of 1311 m located on its eastern flank.|$|R
25|$|Due to the Inquisition {{activities}} in Nuevo León, many crypto-Jewish descendants migrated to frontier colonies further west, using the trade routes {{passing through the}} towns of <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madres</b> Occidental and Chihuahua, Hermosillo and Cananea (Canaan), and to the north on the trade route to Paso del Norte and Santa Fe (both cities in the colonial Santa Fe de Nuevo Mexico). Some even traveled to Alta California on the Pacific Coast.|$|R
5|$|A weak trough {{existed in}} the eastern Gulf of Mexico on September29. A {{circulation}} developed within the storm, becoming a tropical depression on October1. Later that day, the system intensified into Tropical Storm How. Initially, the tropical storm moved west-northwestward and its sustained winds peaked by October2, estimated at 45mph (75km/h). Officials advised small boats to remain at port along the Louisiana coast due to the storm. On October3, Tropical Storm How turned toward the southwest as it began weakening, {{and the next day}} it moved ashore near La Pesca, Tamaulipas as a tropical depression. About six hours after making landfall, How dissipated over the <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre</b> Oriental in northeastern Mexico. How was the only named storm in the season not to attain hurricane status.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} the Gulf of California, an eye began to become apparent on visible satellite imagery, {{and it is}} estimated Isis attained hurricane status late on September 2. Continuing northward, it struck Topolobampo {{in the state of}} Sinaloa early on September 3 as a minimal hurricane. Isis weakened to a tropical storm a few hours after landfall, and subsequent to turning to the north-northwest the low-level circulation dissipated over <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre</b> Occidental. The remnants entered southern Arizona on September 4 and tracked around an upper-level low. After entering Nevada on September 5, the remnants of Isis passed into Oregon before dissipating in Idaho on September 8.|$|E
5|$|Dead Money: The first add-on pack was {{released}} for the Xbox 360 on December 21, 2010 and for PlayStation 3 and PC (via Steam) on February 22, 2011. In Dead Money, the Courier is captured by an insane ex-Brotherhood of Steel leader known as Father Elijah and must work alongside three other captives {{to find the}} fabled treasure of the <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre</b> Casino, concealed from the world by a deadly toxic cloud. The pack adds new achievements/trophies, new weapons, perks, terrain, enemies and decisions for the player, as well as raising the level cap by five.

60|$|When {{the party}} adjourned {{to the porch}} the heat had {{markedly}} decreased and the red sun was sinking over the red desert. An absence of spoken praise, a gradually deepening silence, attested to the impression on the visitors of that noble sunset. Just as the last curve of red rim vanished beyond the dim <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madres</b> and the golden lightning began to flare brighter Helen broke the silence with an exclamation.|$|R
