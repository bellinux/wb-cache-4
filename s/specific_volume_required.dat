In this study we determined the <b>specific</b> <b>volume</b> of an uncharged molecule from the same molar mass range in order to find out whether it shows the same dependencies. To allow application of solvents of widely differing polarity, including water, a poly(ethylene glycol) derivative of molar mass 3, 650 g/mol was used as a model system. The primary method applied for determining the <b>specific</b> <b>volume</b> was the buoyant density method, in which sedimentation equilibrium experiments using solvent mixtures of different density are performed and the <b>specific</b> <b>volume</b> is obtained as the reciprocal of that solvent density for which the compound is neutrally buoyant. A second method applied for determination of the <b>specific</b> <b>volume</b> was digital densimetry. We found that the strong influence of the solvent on the <b>specific</b> <b>volume</b> observed with charged compounds is also shown by the uncharged poly(ethylene glycol) derivative, the differences in the <b>specific</b> <b>volume</b> between different solvent systems amounting up to 15 %; however, no significant dependence on the presence of salt was observed.

40|$|I have {{compared}} {{the effects of}} microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP- 2) and tau on the packing density of sedimented microtubules. Microtubules assembled in vitro in taxol were pelleted by centrifugation. The volumes of the resulting pellets were calculated from their weights assuming a specific gravity of 1 and then were normalized {{to the amount of}} protein in the pellet, yielding a value for pellet <b>specific</b> <b>volume</b> in microliter/mg of protein. The <b>specific</b> <b>volume</b> of the pellets reflects the intermicrotubule spacing within the pellet. Microtubules were assembled from tubulin alone or tubulin plus various amounts of MAP- 2 or tau and collected by centrifugation, and the pellet <b>specific</b> <b>volume</b> was measured. The <b>specific</b> <b>volume</b> of microtubules composed of pure tubulin ranged from 6. 4 to 7. 7 microliter/mg of protein. Tau had no detectable effect on this value even at saturating levels on the microtubules. In contrast, MAP- 2 increased pellet <b>specific</b> <b>volume</b> as the MAP- 2 /tubulin weight ratio increased; at the highest ratio examined, 0. 43, the pellet <b>specific</b> <b>volume</b> was approximately 33. Even at the relatively low MAP- 2 /tubulin ratio of 0. 09, pellet <b>specific</b> <b>volume</b> was approximately 2 -fold greater than that of microtubules containing tubulin alone or tubulin plus tau. Electron microscopy confirmed that the observations on pellet <b>specific</b> <b>volume</b> reflected differences in the effects of MAP- 2 and tau on the packing density of sedimented microtubules. These results are discussed in the context of observations showing that neighboring microtubules are more widely spaced in dendrites than in axons and that MAP- 2 is enriched on microtubules in dendrites compared to microtubules in axons, whereas the converse is true for tau...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT To {{determine}} {{the contribution of}} microtubules to a hypothetical intracellular matrix, we have analyzed the space occupied by microtubules in vitro. Taxol-stabilized microtubules assembled from purified (three-times-cycled) bovine brain microtubule protein were pelleted by centrifugation under standardized conditions. The <b>specific</b> <b>volume</b> of the pellet, defined as the microliter volume per milligram protein, was 2. 2. 4. As suggested by others, this volume was strongly dependent on microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), as shown by quantitation {{of the effects of}} purified MAP supplementation on <b>specific</b> <b>volume.</b> The <b>specific</b> <b>volumes</b> of microtubule pellets stripped of MAPs by high salt or chymotryptic digestion approached the mathematically optimal (least occupied space) and increased 14 fold with the highest MAP concentrations employed. Packing was also dependent on pH. <b>Specific</b> <b>volumes</b> comparable to those of MAP-depleted microtubules were attainable at pH's from 5. 5 to 6. 0, and <b>specific</b> <b>volumes</b> more than doubled at pH 7. 5.

40|$|For {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} the injection-molding process, an accurate {{description of the}} <b>specific</b> <b>volume</b> is needed to predict differential shrinkage during and after molding, which causes thermally induced stresses and controls the dimensional accuracy and long-term dimensional stability. For amorphous polymers, for which it can often be assumed that cooling-rate dependence can be ignored, standard techniques enable measurements of the <b>specific</b> <b>volume</b> {{as a function of}} temperature and pressure. For semicrystalline polymers, the situation is more complicated since the <b>specific</b> <b>volume</b> depends strongly on the degree of crystallinity, which itself depends on the thermomechanical. history, that is, temperature and pressure (for quiescent crystallization). This requires the use of a combined experimental-numerical technique to interpret the data and to determine the <b>specific</b> <b>volume.</b> Standard equipment can only be used at relatively low cooling rates. Since high cooling rates are present during injection molding, improved experimental techniques must be designed. A setup based on the confining fluid technique is built, which can reach cooling rates to 60 Ks(- 1) and pressures to 20 X 10 (6) Pa. During an experiment, the <b>specific</b> <b>volume</b> is measured together with the temperature history and pressure. Using an accurate model to calculate the crystalline structure, together with a specific-volume model which depends on this structure, enables the determination of model parameters.

40|$|Differences in {{molecular}} properties between linear and branched alkanes as well {{as between}} compounds with branched alkyl groups is of relevance due to the large number of branched isomers of environmentally relevant compounds (e. g. fuels, fuel additives, surfactants). For branched alkane vapor pressures, the McGowan <b>specific</b> <b>volume</b> is a poor predictor. Therefore, in this study a correction on the McGowan <b>specific</b> <b>volume</b> is derived {{in terms of the number}} of branches and the number of pairs of vicinal branches to improve the prediction of branched alkane vapor pressures. This branching correction also brought branched /alkane solvent accessible volumes, octanol/water partition coefficients, air/hexadecane partition coefficients, and aqueous solubilities {{as well as}} alkyl-branched substituted aliphatic hydrocarbon air/hexadecane partition coefficients more in line with corresponding linear hydrocarbon properties when compared on a McGowan <b>specific</b> <b>volume</b> basis. Even for air-hexadecane partition coefficients of substituted aliphatic hydrocarbons with substituents at non-terminal carbons, application of the branching correction to the carbon bearing the substituent caused these partition coefficients to be more in line with those for linear compounds. Values for the Abraham A and B solvation parameters for nonlinear aliphatic ethers, amines, and alcohols, recalculated using branching corrected McGowan <b>specific</b> <b>volumes,</b> turned out to be closer to chemical expectations based on linear aliphatic ether, amine and alcohol values compared to previously reported experimental values obtained using uncorrected McGowan <b>specific</b> <b>volumes.</b> A comparison of alkylbenzene and alkene partition coefficient estimates from two different linear solvation energy relations, one containing a McGowan <b>specific</b> <b>volume</b> term and one without such a term, suggests that no branching correction is needed for alkyl groups at sp 2 carbons.

40|$|The aim of {{the project}} is to develop and {{evaluate}} efficient novel surfactant mixtures for enhanced oil recovery. Surfactant loss by adsorption or precipitation depends {{to a great extent}} on the type of surfactant complexes and aggregates formed. Such information as well as techniques to generate the information is lacking currently particularly for surfactant mixtures and surfactant/polymer systems. A novel analytical centrifuge application is explored during the last period to generate information on structures-performance relationship for different surfactant aggregates in solution and, in turn, at interfaces. To use analytical untracentrifuge for surfactant mixtures, information on partial <b>specific</b> <b>volumes</b> of single surfactants and their mixtures is required. Towards this purpose, surface tension and density measurements were performed to determine critical micellar concentrations (cmc), partial <b>specific</b> <b>volumes</b> of n-dodecyl-{beta}-Dmaltoside (DM), nonyl phenol ethoxylated decyl ether (NP- 10) and their 1 : 1 mixtures at 25 C. Durchschlag's theoretical calculation method was adopted to calculate the partial <b>specific</b> <b>volumes.</b> Effects of temperature and mixing, as well as methods used for estimation on micellization and partial <b>specific</b> <b>volumes</b> were studied during the current period. Surface tension results revealed no interaction between the two surfactants in mixed micelles. Partial <b>specific</b> <b>volume</b> measurements also indicated no interaction in mixed micelles. Maximum adsorption density, area per molecule and free energy of micellization were also calculated. Partial <b>specific</b> <b>volumes</b> were estimated by two experimental methods: d{sub {rho}}/dc and V{sub {sigma}}.
