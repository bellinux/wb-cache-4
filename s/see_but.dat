In the following year Adam de Darlington was compensated by being appointed Bishop of Caithness, the bishopric which adjoined Ross to the north.|$|E
5|$|Millipede eyes {{consist of}} several simple flat-lensed ocelli {{arranged}} in a group or patch {{on each side of}} the head. These patches are also called ocular fields or ocellaria. Many species of millipedes, including the entire order Polydesmida and cave-dwelling millipedes such as Causeyella and Trichopetalum, had ancestors that could <b>see</b> <b>but</b> have subsequently lost their eyes and are blind.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin II was {{captured}} in 1123, and the burghers of Antioch sent envoys to Bohemond, urging {{him to come to}} his principality. Bohemond reached the age of majority at the age of 16. According to William of Tyre, he made an agreement with William II, Duke of Apulia, stipulating that the one who first died without issue was to will his principality to the other; however, the reliability of William's report is suspect. Alexander of Telese recorded that before leaving for Syria, Bohemond entrusted his Italian domains to the Holy <b>See,</b> <b>but</b> Romuald of Salerno said that he made Alexander, Count of Conversano, the overseer of those lands. Bohemond sailed from Otranto with a fleet of twenty-four ships in September 1126.|$|E

5|$|Sigismund {{decided to}} join the Holy League {{together}} with Aaron the Tyrant, voivode of Moldavia, and Michael the Brave, voivode of Wallachia, on 5October 1594. The two voivodes had started direct negotiations with the Holy <b>See,</b> <b>but</b> Sigismund, who claimed suzerainty over them, prevented them from conducting further direct negotiations. Sigismund's envoy, Stephen Bocskai, signed the document that confirmed the membership of Transylvania in the Holy League in Prague on 28January 1595. According to the treaty, RudolphII recognized Sigismund's hereditary right to rule Transylvania and Partium {{and to use the}} title of prince, but he also stipulated that the principality was to be re-united with the Hungarian Crown if Sigismund's family died out. The Diet of Transylvania confirmed the treaty on 16April. The Diet also prohibited religious innovations, which gave rise to the persecution of Szekler Sabbatarians in Udvarhelyszék.|$|E
5|$|After {{the court}} adjourned, St-Calais was held as a {{prisoner}} at Wilton Abbey until his followers in Durham relinquished the castle. Once the castle was back under the king's control, St-Calais was released, and left for Normandy, and no more was heard of his appeal to Rome. Pope Urban II did write to the king in 1089 requesting that St-Calais be restored to his <b>see,</b> <b>but</b> nothing came of it. In Normandy, St-Calais quickly became one of Duke Robert's principal advisors and his chief administrator. On 14 November 1091 he regained the favour of William Rufus, and was restored to his see. Duke Robert had persuaded the king to allow Bishop William's return, perhaps in recognition of a service St-Calais performed for the king by brokering {{the end of a}} siege in Normandy that the king's forces were about to lose. The end of the siege prevented the loss of the castle.|$|E

25|$|The naked {{human eye}} is weakly {{sensitive}} to polarization, {{without the need}} for intervening filters. Polarized light creates a very faint pattern {{near the center of the}} visual field, called Haidinger's brush. This pattern is very difficult to <b>see,</b> <b>but</b> with practice one can learn to detect polarized light with the naked eye.|$|E
25|$|There {{were many}} {{different}} types of inquisitions depending on the location and methods; historians have generally classified them into the episcopal inquisition and the papal inquisition. All major medieval inquisitions were decentralized, and each tribunal worked independently. Authority rested with local officials based on guidelines from the Holy <b>See,</b> <b>but</b> there was no central top-down authority running the inquisitions, as would be the case in post-medieval inquisitions.|$|E

25|$|Wildlife is {{abundant}} {{on the slopes}} of Blue Knob.

Black bears are also resident on the mountain {{and are more likely to}} be seen during the early morning and evening hours. Red-tailed hawks, warblers, vireos and songbirds are found here throughout the seasons.|$|E
25|$|After Pope Pius XI died in February 1939, his {{successor}} Pope Pius XII did not renew Papen's honorary title of Papal chamberlain. As nuncio, the future Pope John XXIII, Angelo Roncalli, had been acquainted with Papen in Greece and Turkey during World War II. The German government considered appointing Papen {{ambassador to the}} Holy <b>See,</b> <b>but</b> Pope Pius XII, after consulting Konrad von Preysing, Bishop of Berlin, rejected this proposal.|$|E

25|$|There {{are other}} Marian pilgrimage {{sites such as}} Medjugorje, which is not {{considered}} a shrine by the Holy <b>See,</b> <b>but</b> yet receives {{a large number of}} pilgrims every year. The number of pilgrims who visit some of the approved shrines every year can be significant. E.g. Lourdes with a population of around 15,000 people, receives about 5,000,000 pilgrims every year. In 1881 a French priest, Julien Gouyet, led by the visions of Jesus and Mary of the Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich (Klemens Brentano, 1852) discovered the House of the Virgin Mary near Ephesus in Turkey.|$|E
25|$|Sadberge was a liberty, {{sometimes}} referred to as a county, within Northumberland. In 1189 it was purchased for the <b>see</b> <b>but</b> continued with a separate sheriff, coroner and court of pleas. In the 14th century Sadberge was included in Stockton ward and was itself divided into two wards. The division into the four wards of Chester-le-Street, Darlington, Easington and Stockton existed in the 13th century, each ward having its own coroner and a three-weekly court corresponding to the hundred court. The diocese was divided into the archdeaconries of Durham and Northumberland. The former is mentioned in 1072, and in 1291 included the deaneries of Chester-le-Street, Auckland, Lanchester and Darlington.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{opposition}} of Duke Charles and the ultra-Protestants, these measures were adopted by the Riksdag of the Estates in 1577. They greatly encouraged the Catholic party in Europe, and John III was ultimately persuaded to send an embassy to Rome to open negotiations for the reunion of the Swedish Church with the Holy <b>See.</b> <b>But</b> though the Jesuit Antonio Possevino was sent to Stockholm to complete John's conversion, John would only consent to embrace Catholicism under certain conditions which were never fulfilled, and the only result of all these subterraneous negotiations was to incense the Protestants still more against the new liturgy, the use of which by every congregation in the realm without exception was, nevertheless, decreed by the Riksdag of 1582.|$|E

25|$|The {{overwhelming}} {{strength of}} Joseph I in Italy had served to emphasise the ongoing tensions between Imperial and Papal suzerainty: in the Duchy of Parma (which the papacy had deemed a fief of the Holy <b>See,</b> <b>but</b> which Joseph I deemed a fief of the Empire), {{as well as}} in the Duchy of Milan, Pope Clement XI forbade the collection of Imperial taxes on the church. To gain leverage, the Austrians seized the disputed town of Comacchio in May 1708, before Daun overran large parts of the Papal States. The Pope raised an army of 25,000 men under Marsigli but he soon capitulated, and in return for Joseph I submitting the disputes over Parma and Comacchio to a cardinal's commission, Clement XI recognised Archduke Charles as King Charles III of Spain. In the meantime, fighting continued along the French-Savoy border as the Duke of Savoy sought his own 'Barrier' against future French incursion, and in July he launched a campaign towards Briançon, capturing Exilles and Fenestrelle. These raids were repeated in subsequent years of the war, but Austrian and Savoyard commanders could not overcome the difficulties in launching a full-scale attack over the Alps, and the Emperor showed little enthusiasm for liberating the Duke's occupied transalpine territories of Nice and Savoy.|$|E
