5|$|During {{the second}} leg, on Friday, 2 May, at the seventh {{kilometre}} of the 18th stage, Corteâ€“Taverna, Toivonen's Lancia {{went off the}} side of the road at a tight left corner with no guardrail. The car plunged down a ravine and crashed on its roof. The aluminium fuel tank underneath the driver's seat was ruptured by the trees and exploded. The fuel tank was not protected by a <b>skid</b> <b>plate,</b> an item used mainly on gravel rallies, which was not fitted for the all-asphalt Tour de Corse. The explosion happened within seconds of the crash, and Toivonen and his co-driver, Sergio Cresto would not have time to get out had they still been alive. The fire caused by the explosion was so intense that the Delta S4, built of fast-burning kevlar-reinforced plastic composite, was unidentifiable as a car afterwards. Both Toivonen and Cresto died in their seats. Toivonen left behind wife Erja (married in 1982) and two young children, son Markus and daughter Arla, while Cresto was single with no children.|$|E

50|$|A danger with off-roading is {{damage to}} the vehicle from hitting rocks or other hard {{surfaces}} on very uneven terrain. A typical solution would be to install <b>skid</b> <b>plates</b> (sometimes also called bash plates), which are thick metal plates protecting vulnerable parts (such as the transfer/gear box or engine oil sump). Some manufacturers install <b>skid</b> <b>plates</b> as standard equipment on some of their vehicles. For many others this additional protection is available as an after-market accessory. <b>Skid</b> <b>plates</b> may be simple flat plates, but {{they may also be}} formed (by stamping or by welding multiple pieces) to protect shaped items like differentials. Fuel tank <b>skid</b> <b>plates</b> are a common factory option. In addition to <b>skid</b> <b>plates,</b> many off-roaders install differential covers that will not bend or break if they are smashed on rocks or other large objects. Since the axles on an off-road vehicle typically are the lowest hanging part of the vehicle making them susceptible to damage.|$|R
2500|$|Toyota {{announced}} that the 2014 model year would be the final production year of the FJ Cruiser for the U.S. Market, therefore to add uniqueness to {{the final version of}} the Trail Teams Special Edition, Toyota designated the final version to be the Trail Teams Ultimate Edition which features a few special upgrades. The 2014 Trail Teams Ultimate Edition FJ Cruiser comes in a Heritage Blue paint scheme (resembling an original FJ40 Land Cruiser factory paint color), and for the first time features a white grille bezel that again pays tribute to the iconic Land Cruiser FJ40. The remaining vehicle trim remains black, similar to previous versions of the Trail Teams Special Edition. [...] While all of the Trail Teams FJ Cruisers feature a race-inspired TRD/Trail Teams off-road suspension designed by Bilstein, the Ultimate Edition features a new rear remote reservoir suspension. The suspension also raises the vehicle slightly taller than stock as to achieve a leveled stance. The Ultimate Edition is also equipped with a special 1/4 inch thick aluminum TRD <b>skid</b> <b>plate,</b> designed to help with the approach angle for the front of the vehicle and provide better protection while off-roading. Significant interior differences that are unique to the 2014 Trails Team Ultimate Edition include; the interior panel inserts are black rather than color matched to the exterior color of the vehicle, the radio bezel is silver, and a special [...] "Ultimate Edition" [...] dash plaque is affixed to the dash on the passenger side indicating the special edition is only [...] "One of 2500."
