40|$|A sale of {{real estate}} is financed by the seller, and the buyer's initial {{investment}} is not sufficient for recognition of profit under the full accrual method. The seller meets the conditions of Statement 66 to record a sale and recognizes profit on the installment or cost recovery methods. Subsequently, the buyer defaults on the mortgage to the seller, and the seller forecloses on the property. At the time of foreclosure, fair value of the property is less than the seller's gross receivable but greater than the seller's net receivable, that is, the principal and interest receivable less the deferred profit on the sale <b>and</b> <b>related</b> <b>allowances.</b> The issue is the amount at which the foreclosed property should be recorded. EITF DISCUSSION The Task Force reached a consensus that the foreclosed property should be recorded at the lower of the net amount of the receivable or fair value of the property. [Note: This consensus has been partially nullified by Statement 144.

40|$|The family {{means an}} {{environment}} in which human personality is formed, where human capital is created and where future generations are raised and educated. Its prosperity influences the development of the state as well as the cultural, social and economic development. It is always a stressful situation for the family if the newborn child is handicapped or if the handicap develops in a child so far healthy. There may be inevitable changes in parents´ employment, in the lifestyle of the family, in the way of spending free time and often even in the relationships within the family. One form of possible alleviation in such a situation is the existence of social services. Act no. 108 / 2006 on Social Services is aimed at specifying particular types of social services <b>and</b> <b>related</b> <b>allowances</b> as a tool for helping. The intended outcome is a healthy, competitive environment in this sphere and subsequent growth of social services network. The submitted bachelor thesis is based on qualitative research focused on the opinions and attitudes of handicapped children´s parents. The parents evaluated the current forms of support provided for their families, the offer of social services in their region and the services utilization. The thesis also surveys how much information is available to the parents as regards the system of social help and social services, what is their first experience regarding family care allowance. This allowance is a new form within the Czech social support system. The sample consisted of thirty parents of handicapped children and the data collection technique was based on semi-standardized interviews and content analysis. The survey results yielded the following hypothesis for prospective quantitative research: The interest of families with a handicapped child in broader offer of social services does not depend on the nominal value of allowances intended for covering the cost of these services...|$|R

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Under the Department of Education's Federal Direct Loan Program (FDLP), students or their parents borrow money directly {{from the federal government}} through the vocational, undergraduate, or graduate schools that students attend. FDLP offers four loan types, including consolidation loans, which allow borrowers to combine multiple loans, possibly from different federal student loan programs, into a single loan with one monthly payment and a fixed borrower interest rate. The other three FDLP loan types provide variable borrower interest rates. The reported outstanding gross balance of FDLP loans to borrowers was $ 84. 5 billion as of September 30, 2003, <b>and</b> the <b>related</b> <b>allowance</b> for subsidy [...] or the cost Education expected to incur on the outstanding loans [...] was $ 657 million. The key driver of the FDLP cost to the government is the difference between the borrower interest rate and Education's financing cost or borrowing rate from Treasury. Because of concerns about Education's reliance on estimates to project FDLP costs and a lack of historical information on which to base those estimates, the House Committee on the Budget previously asked us to review key aspects of Education's cost estimates for FDLP. Our January 2001 report identified the need for Education to improve its cost estimation process to provide more meaningful information. Recently, {{at the request of the}} Committee's Chairman, we assessed Education's progress in addressing our January 2001 recommendations and we updated certain cash flow information related to FDLP.

40|$|There has {{recently}} been public discussion of the rewards available to senior staff in English and Welsh charities. However, that discussion is usually based on examples of individual salaries, or on unrepresentative and small subsets of the charity population. To provide a robust and informed basis for debate, we have conducted analyses of evidence on the payment of high salaries (defined as {{the numbers of people}} paid above £ 60 000 p. a., a reporting threshold used by the Charity Commission) in (a) a representative sample of c. 10 000 English and Welsh charities, and (b) surveys of individuals regarding comparative salary levels in different sectors of the economy. Overall, survey data shows that the proportion of staff in receipt of high salaries is lower than average in the third sector than in other sectors. Information from charity annual accounts is used to demonstrate which charities are more likely than others to pay such <b>salaries,</b> <b>and</b> to <b>relate</b> the likelihood of paying high salaries to charity characteristics (income, location, and subsector). We show that the distribution of high pay in the charitable sector is largely a function of the size and complexity of organisations, and is generally unrelated to subsector or income mix...|$|R
