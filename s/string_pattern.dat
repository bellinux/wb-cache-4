40|$|Abstract. Artificial neural {{networks}} {{are one of}} the most commonly used tools for character recognition problems, and usually they take gray values of 2 D character images as inputs. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network classifier whose input is 1 D <b>string</b> <b>patterns</b> generated from the spatial relationships of primitive structures of Ethiopic characters. The spatial relationships of primitives are modeled by a special tree structure from which a unique set of <b>string</b> <b>patterns</b> are generated for each character. Training the neural network with <b>string</b> <b>patterns</b> of different font types and styles enables the classifier to handle variations in font types, sizes, and styles. We use a pair of directional filters for extracting primitives and their spatial relationships. The robustness of the proposed recognition system is tested by real life documents and experimental results are reported. Ethiopic script is a writing system used mainly in Ethiopia by several languages like Geez, Amharic, Tigrigna, Guragegna, etc. The recently standardized alphabet has a total of 435 characters. However, the most commonly used alphabet has 34 base characters and six other orders conveniently written as shown in Table 1. The firs...|$|R

Specifically, I examine how levels of earnings management change as earnings string firms approach {{the end of their}} earnings <b>string</b> <b>patterns.</b> My results show that earnings string firms engage in income-increasing earnings management consistent with an attempt to stretch these earnings <b>string</b> <b>patterns.</b> I also examine whether the cumulative effect of income-increasing earnings management activities during the earnings string period reduces the ability of these firms to continue reporting earnings increases. I do not find evidence to suggest that earnings string firms, on average, break their earnings <b>string</b> <b>patterns</b> because they ran out of accounting flexibility. However, there are two instances which the accumulated effect of income-increasing earnings management increases the likelihood of ending the earnings string. The two instances relate to firms which repeatedly engage in income-increasing earnings management throughout the earnings string period, and firms whose pre-managed earnings decline {{in the last year of}} the earnings string period. Finally, I show that firms that resume a subsequent series of reporting at least three consecutive years of annual earnings increases, on average, exhibit similar earnings management behavior. That is, these firms also increasingly resort to income-increasing earnings management toward the end of their second (or third) earnings strings. Dissertatio...|$|R
30|$|A {{real-time}} positioning method {{based on}} the <b>pattern</b> <b>string</b> TMWM with high performance and multi-pattern matching in the network big data environment is proposed. Firstly, the algorithm was initialized, the MWM algorithm was used to continuously match the network data, and the TMWM algorithm was used to improve it. Afterwards, the IP and IP address databases corresponding to the matched network data were compared to complete the positioning of specific objects in the big data environment. Compared with the traditional MWM and STRFINDUNI matching methods, the improved TMWM algorithm may reduce the matching range of the target <b>pattern</b> <b>strings,</b> accelerate the search speed of the <b>pattern</b> <b>strings,</b> and enhance the clue and keyword search speed of about 100 %, thus solving the problem of efficiently searching the desired <b>pattern</b> <b>strings</b> in the big data environment. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithm in terms of <b>pattern</b> <b>string</b> matching speed and matching efficiency are verified by comparing and analyzing the number of <b>pattern</b> <b>strings,</b> text size, average length of <b>pattern</b> <b>strings,</b> and the hit number of times.|$|R

50|$|Its {{principal}} drawbacks {{are much}} higher cost to manufacture and purchase than other materials, weakness to shear stresses from off-center hits (typical of beginning players), variable quality control depending upon the brand, batch, age, storage conditions, and grade, difficulty of stringing due to its delicacy, and poor durability when wetted with water. Natural gut is very sensitive to different types of weather and those players who use it normally carry several different racquets with different tensions to compensate for this. Some players, particularly those who hit flat shots and hit the sweet spot consistently, find high-quality gut to be more durable than many other types of strings due to its outstanding tension retention. This may help to offset the high initial cost. The use of a dense <b>string</b> <b>pattern</b> also generally improves the longevity of natural gut.|$|E

5000|$|The Pro Staff 6.0 {{version was}} {{manufactured}} in four head sizes: 85, 95, 110, and 125 square inches. The 85 is unforgiving for the currently popular semi-western topspin style with its 12.6 ounce (357 g) weight and low power. The 95 is more forgiving of off-center shots {{with an overall}} weight of 12.2 ounces (346 g) and a lower swingweight (317 {{as opposed to the}} 85's 326). However, it has a higher flexibility, particularly in the upper hoop, due to its larger head size, which has been described as undesirably [...] "whippy". Both have a 16x18 <b>string</b> <b>pattern</b> making the frame more open and easier to generate spin albeit the user must generate much of the spin's power with timing and wrist pronation.
