5|$|Ashford {{has been}} {{associated}} with the German town Bad Münstereifel since the 20th century. British forces occupied the town in 1919 under the command of Major J Goode, following the end of the war. Goode subsequently formed close friendships with <b>some</b> <b>Bad</b> Münstereifel residents. John Wiles, Major Goode's brother in law, later became mayor of New Romney in 1946, and subsequently arranged a visit to the Rhineland with Winston Churchill. Wiles arranged several other exchange visits between British and German families, at a time where travel between the two countries was rare. He was declared an honorary citizen of Bad Münstereifel in 1961, which led to the two towns being formally twinned in 1964. Bad Münstereifel was twinned with the French town of Fougères, Brittany two years later, which led to a twinning with Ashford in 1984.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{physical}} isolation, the islanders maintained a lively community. A school {{had been established}} in 1723 by the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge (SPCK), with sixty children on its initial attendance roll. The demands of island life conflicted to some extent with those of schooling. The SPCK's inspector found only eighteen out of seventy pupils present when he visited in 1824. He found {{that many of the}} children were fully occupied helping their families in summer and only attended school in winter. Two places of worship were built within a couple of years of each other, a Baptist chapel in 1877 and a Church of Scotland church in 1878 (at a cost of £900). Although they soon became focal elements of community life, there seems to have been <b>some</b> <b>bad</b> blood between the two congregations, perhaps due to a clash between the missionary zeal of local Baptists and the Calvinism of the Presbyterian Kirk.|$|E

Antônio Carlos Zago took over Palmeiras in February, and in his first match with the team, he defeated rival São Paulo by 2-0 in the Choque-Rei. Antônio Carlos managed Palmeiras with high-class wins against rivals, however Palmeiras didn't play well along the Championship and preferred to give more focus in the Copa do Brasil. After a bad campaign, on 7 April, Palmeiras finished the competition in 11th place with 25 points.|$|E
25|$|Wainwright first {{played for}} Yorkshire in 1888, and {{immediately}} established {{his place in}} the side, chiefly through an innings of 105 against the Australians. He developed slowly {{over the next couple of}} years, but his performance on a sticky wicket at Sheffield in 1891 was the performance that established Wainwright as a deadly soft-wicket bowler. Wainwright showed no advancement as a batsman until 1893, when he got close to doing the double and played his first Test at Lord's without success. Wainwright was Yorkshire's leading wicket-taker in 1892, though they fared only modestly, and in 1893, aided by <b>some</b> <b>bad</b> wickets due to a dry spring, he took 90 wickets for 12.55 each, to help Yorkshire win its first Championship. By this time, he and Bobby Peel were the finest slow bowling partnership in county cricket, and they were often unplayable when the wicket helped them.|$|E
25|$|Another {{foil for}} Ralph is Alice's mother, who is even sharper-tongued than her daughter. She despises Ralph {{as a bad}} provider.

Alice's sister, Agnes, appeared in one episode (Ralph jeopardizes his newlywed sister-in-law's marriage after giving <b>some</b> <b>bad</b> advice to the groom, but all works out in the end). Ralph and Alice lived with her mother for six years after getting married before they got their own apartment. Ralph's mother rarely is mentioned, although she does appear in one episode. Ralph's father is only mentioned in one episode ("Young Man with a Horn") as having given Ralph a cornet he learned to play as a boy, and insists on keeping when Alice suggests it be thrown away. In a 1967 revival, Ralph refers to Alice (played by Sheila MacRae 1966–70 and once more in 1973) as being one of 12 children with her father never working.|$|E

25|$|After the disappointing {{performance}} in the 2009 Série A, when Palmeiras almost won the league and after <b>some</b> <b>bad</b> results {{in the end of}} the championship, finished in 5th qualifying only to the Copa Sudamericana and not to the major South American tournament, the Copa Libertadores, the team started the competition playing against Brazilian rivals, Vitória in Salvador. Palmeiras played well but couldn't stop Vitória from scoring two goals, one of them a good free-kick by Ramon, the club's captain, and the other in the stoppage time. The final result was not good, because the team had to win by a 3-goal margin to qualify to the Round of 16, or face the penalties if a 2-goal win happened to come. The 2nd leg in São Paulo, saw a marvelous 3-0 win with very good performances from the whole squad, mainly from Tadeu, who scored twice and Marcos Assunção who commanded the team's victory with an outstanding match and a beautiful free-kick goal from 35 meters in the dying minutes, assuring a qualification to the next round with the aggregat score of 3-2.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{traveled}} to Pittsburgh on June 24 {{to open a}} four-game series against the Pirates at PNC Park. Nick Tepesch was promoted from AAA to make a spot start and he allowed five runs on seven hits in only four innings to put the team in a hole they never recovered from. Corey Seager had four hits in the game but the Dodgers lost 8–6. Kershaw allowed four runs in a game {{for the first time}} all season as his 10 start unbeaten streak came to an end with a 4–3 loss to the Pirates on June 26. In the final game of the series, the Pirates jumped out to a four run lead in the first inning but the Dodgers came from behind to win 5–4 to avoid the sweep. Urías picked up his first major league win on June 28 with a 6–5 victory over the Brewers at Miller Park. Junior Guerra shut down the Dodgers bats the next say as rookie Brock Stewart had a rough debut, allowing five runs in the second inning as the Dodgers lost 7–0. The Dodgers received <b>some</b> <b>bad</b> news as the month ended, with Kershaw heading to the disabled list due to a herniated disc in his back. Meanwhile, the team won the final game of the month, 8–1. Maeda allowed only one run on three hits in six innings and the Dodgers hit three home runs.|$|E

[...] If you knock balls loose you should get on them. If you tip balls in the air you should catch them. We're not going to have any excuses." [...] Brown cited the lack of big plays on defense, particularly the lack of forced turnovers, as a problem for Texas. [...] Both Brown and Greg Davis hinted that Jamaal Charles could face less playing time as a result of his problems hanging onto the ball.|$|E

50|$|The {{inclusion}} of even {{small amounts of}} some elements can have profound effects on the behavioral characteristics of a batch of iron or the operation of a smelter. These effects can be both good and <b>bad,</b> <b>some</b> catastrophically <b>bad.</b> <b>Some</b> chemicals are deliberately added such as flux which makes a blast furnace more efficient. Others are added because they make the iron more fluid, harder, or give it some other desirable quality.

In reality this is rarely the case. Typically, iron ore contains a host of elements which are often unwanted in modern steel.|$|R
