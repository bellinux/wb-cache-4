Both techniques are typically encountered {{in the field of}} colloid and polymer characterization. They also have a broad range of other applications.|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{enhancing}} a sensitivity of an optical sensor having an optical cavity counter-propagates beams of pump light within the optical cavity to produce <b>scattered</b> <b>light</b> based on Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS). The {{properties of the}} pump light are selected to generate fast-light conditions for the <b>scattered</b> <b>light,</b> such that the <b>scattered</b> <b>light</b> includes counter-propagating beams of fast light. The method prevents the pump light from resonating within the optical cavity, while allowing the <b>scattered</b> <b>light</b> to resonate within the optical cavity. At least portions of the <b>scattered</b> <b>light</b> are interfered outside of the optical cavity to produce a beat note for a measurement of the optical sensor. The disclosed method is particularly applicable to optical gyroscopes...|$|R
50|$|The Raman <b>scattered</b> <b>light</b> is {{emitted by}} the {{stimulation}} of the electric field of the incident light. Therefore, {{the direction of the}} vibration of the electric field, or polarization direction, of the <b>scattered</b> <b>light</b> might be expected to be {{the same as that of}} the incident light. In reality, however, some fraction of the Raman <b>scattered</b> <b>light</b> has a polarization direction that is perpendicular to that of the incident light. This component is called the perpendicular component. Naturally, the component of the Raman <b>scattered</b> <b>light</b> whose polarization direction is parallel to that of the incident light is called the parallel component, and the Raman <b>scattered</b> <b>light</b> consists of the parallel component and the perpendicular component. The ratio between these two components is expressed as the depolarization ratio.|$|R
40|$|We quantitatively {{assess the}} impact of grating scatter within the FOS as a {{function}} of intrinsic target spectrum and spectral element employed. bspec, the FOS <b>scattered</b> <b>light</b> optical modeling code of Micheael Rosa, has been used for this analysis. In this poster we present an example from an atlas of spectra (published in FOS ISR 151) illustrating the amount of predicted <b>scattered</b> <b>light</b> for all high dispersion gratings with both FOS detectors for a representative range of colors and object types. As has been qualitatively noted previously, we find that the intrinsic color of the observed object can affect the amount of <b>scattered</b> <b>light</b> detected and that this <b>scattered</b> <b>light</b> is, in most cases, wavelength independent. For the limited number of spectral elements to which it can be applied, the standard FOS pipeline <b>scattered</b> <b>light</b> correction is, therefore, a good approximation.

40|$|Radiative {{transfer}} {{models in}} a spherical, turbulent interstellar medium (ISM) {{in which the}} photon source is situated at the center are calculated to investigate {{the correlation between the}} <b>scattered</b> <b>light</b> and the dust column density. The medium is modeled using fractional Brownian motion structures that are appropriate for turbulent ISM. The correlation plot between the <b>scattered</b> <b>light</b> and optical depth shows substantial scatter and deviation from simple proportionality. It was also found that the overall density contrast is smoothed out in <b>scattered</b> <b>light.</b> In other words, there is an enhancement of the dust-scattered flux in low-density regions, while the scattered flux is suppressed in high-density regions. The correlation becomes less significant as the scattering becomes closer to be isotropic and the medium becomes more turbulent. Therefore, the <b>scattered</b> <b>light</b> observed in near-infrared wavelengths would show much weaker correlation than the observations in optical and ultraviolet wavelengths. We also find that the correlation plot between <b>scattered</b> <b>lights</b> at two different wavelengths shows a tighter correlation than that of the <b>scattered</b> <b>light</b> versus the optical depth.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is on how <b>light</b> is <b>scattered</b> on its passage through the optics of the human eye, and the {{consequences}} for visual performance under different lighting conditions. A number of visual psychophysical measurement techniques were employed to investigate the impact of <b>light</b> <b>scatter</b> on various aspects of visual performance. The preliminary experiments carried out were designed to explore the physical properties of <b>scattered</b> <b>light</b> in the eye. <b>Scattered</b> <b>light</b> varies in both amount and angular dependence, outcomes that relate directly to the number and size of particles involved. In this respect, <b>scattered</b> <b>light</b> is estimated using two methods: one that measures both the amount and the angular dependence of <b>scattered</b> <b>light</b> and the other that assumes constant angular dependence in all observers. The findings show that there are significant differences in angular dependence between observers and {{that the size of}} the differences correlates with errors in the estimation of the overall amount of scatter. Experiments were then carried out to investigate the effects of increased <b>scattered</b> <b>light</b> on visual performance and whether these can explain any aspects of age-related visual degradation. To disentangle increased <b>scattered</b> <b>light</b> from the innumerable other changes that occur with ageing, the amount of <b>scattered</b> <b>light</b> in young, healthy eyes was increased using fogging filters. Increased scatter is shown to have only a small effect on chromatic sensitivity and the ability to recognise letters or other high contrast optotypes that are commonly used to assess visual acuity. Contrast sensitivity, on the other hand, can be much reduced in the presence of increased <b>light</b> <b>scatter...</b>|$|R
40|$|NOVELTY - The {{system has}} an optical {{detection}} system (2) and a Coblentz sphere (1). <b>Scattered</b> <b>light</b> {{is measured in}} a transmission and a reflection direction rotatable relative to a light source. The Coblentz sphere and the optical detection system together can be swivelled through 180 deg., about an axis (A) parallel to the sample plane. The combined system is held exactly in both end bearings with a securing unit (5). USE - Measurement of <b>scattered</b> <b>light</b> at a sample selectively in transmission and reflection direction also determines illuminating light in both directions.

Different implementations of cross-correlation <b>light</b> <b>scattering</b> have been developed and applied.

40|$|Abstract. Methods of UV/VIS {{absorption}} spectroscopy {{to determine the}} constituents in the Earth’s atmosphere from measurements of <b>scattered</b> <b>light</b> are often based on the Beer-Lambert law, like e. g. Differential Optical Absorption Spec-troscopy (DOAS). While the Beer-Lambert law is strictly valid for a single light path only, {{the relation between the}} op-tical depth and the concentration of any absorber can be ap-proximated as linear also for <b>scattered</b> <b>light</b> observations at a single wavelength if the absorption is weak. If the light path distribution is approximated not to vary with wavelength, also linearity between the optical depth and the product of the cross-section and the concentration of an absorber can be assumed. These assumptions are widely made for DOAS applications for <b>scattered</b> <b>light</b> observations. For medium and strong absorption of <b>scattered</b> <b>light</b> (e. g...|$|R
