50|$|The term {{full frame}} {{is used by}} users of digital single-lens reflex cameras (DSLRs) as a {{shorthand}} for an image sensor format {{which is the same}} <b>size</b> as 35mm <b>format</b> (36 mm × 24 mm) film.Historically, 35mm was considered a small film format compared with medium <b>format,</b> <b>large</b> <b>format</b> and even <b>larger.</b> This is in contrast to cameras with smaller sensors (for instance, those with a size equivalent to APS-C-size film), much smaller than a full 35mm frame. Currently, the majority of digital cameras, both compact and SLR models, use a smaller-than-35 mm frame, as it is easier and cheaper to manufacture imaging sensors at a smaller size. Historically, the earliest digital SLR models, such as the Nikon NASA F4 or Kodak DCS 100, also used a smaller sensor. Kodak states that 35mm film has the equivalent of 6,000 pixel horizontal resolution according to a Senior Vice President of IMAX.|$|R
5000|$|The {{size of the}} 135 film frame {{has been}} adopted by many {{high-end}} digital single-lens reflex and digital mirrorless cameras, {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "full frame".

50|$|A few 35 mm cameras {{have had}} digital camera backs made by their manufacturer, Leica being a notable example. Medium <b>format</b> and <b>large</b> <b>format</b> cameras (those using film stock greater than 35 mm), {{have a low}} unit production, and typical digital backs for them cost over $10,000. These cameras {{also tend to be}} highly modular, with handgrips, film backs, winders, and lenses {{available}} separately to fit various needs.|$|R
5|$|The lens is {{equipped}} with a full-frame digital SLR-compatible mount allowing the usage of both APS-C <b>sized</b> cameras and <b>formats</b> <b>larger</b> than APS-C – the build in lens hood however visibly restricts the field of view (FOV) on <b>formats</b> <b>larger</b> than APS-C – see example above. The FOV in APS-C sized cameras is further restricted at shorter focal lengths if the front cap adaptor ring is not removed – see example below.|$|R
50|$|Leaf, {{previously}} {{a division}} of Scitex and later Kodak, is now a subsidiary of Phase One. Leaf manufactures high end digital backs for medium <b>format</b> and <b>large</b> <b>format</b> cameras. In 1991, Leaf introduced the first medium format digital camera back, the Leaf DCB1, nicknamed ‘The Brick’, which had a resolution of 4 million pixels (4 megapixels). As of 2012, Leaf produces the Credo line of digital camera backs, ranging from 40 to 80 megapixels. Until 2010, Leaf also produced photography workflow software Leaf Capture.|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} use of Ilfochrome was for image capture directly {{inside a}} <b>large</b> <b>format</b> or ultra <b>large</b> <b>format</b> camera. This created a unique original positive photograph, {{in which the}} subject is reversed left-right unless a mirror or prism was used {{in front of the}} camera lens. A much longer exposure was required than with sheet films or plates designed for use in a camera. The procedure thus resembled the slow daguerreotype and ambrotype direct positive black-and-white processes used in the 1850s.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Large</b> <b>format</b> film is {{also used}} to record of {{historic}} resources for the National Park Service documentation programs. The Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS), the Historic American Engineering Record (HAER), and the Historic American Landscapes Survey (HALS) require <b>large</b> <b>format</b> film-based photography. 4×5", 5×7", and 8×10" [...] <b>large</b> <b>format</b> film formats are the only acceptable formats for inclusion in these collections at the Library of Congress. 4x5 and 5x7 are generally used in the field (5×7" [...] is preferred for very significant buildings) and 8×10" [...] is generally utilized for photo-duplication of historic photographs, documents and blueprints. Through HABS/HAER/HALS, buildings and sites of historic significance are recorded with <b>large</b> <b>format</b> cameras and black and white film and using techniques that document the key features of the historic resource with special care not to distort the angles and views. This rectified photography can be accomplished with <b>large</b> <b>format</b> cameras by keeping the film, lens and subject perfectly parallel. Smaller format cameras need to be tilted to view high or low subjects, but the same subjects can be captured by shifting the lens element of a <b>large</b> <b>format</b> camera up or down to keep the film, lens, and subject planes parallel.|$|R
5000|$|Consumer-size {{photographic}} film is commonly sold in a 35 mm standard (24x36 mm negative), although print <b>sizes</b> and <b>large</b> <b>format</b> films are defined in inches. Digital camera sensor sizes are measured in an archaic manner indicating inverse fractions of an inch, as a 1/1.6" [...] sensor {{is larger than}} 1/2.5" [...] sensor. However, lenses are marked in terms of focal length in millimeters (e.g., average natural human field of view is a lens with 50 mm focal length for 35 mm film).|$|R
50|$|The format {{originated}} with Oskar Barnack and his {{introduction of the}} Leica camera in the 1920s. Thus it is sometimes called the Leica format or Barnack format. The name 35 mm originates with the total width of the 135 film, the perforated cartridge film which was the primary medium of the format prior to {{the invention of the}} full frame DSLR. The term 135 format remains in use. In digital photography, the format {{has come to be known}} as full frame, FF or FX, the latter invented as a trade mark of Nikon. Historically the 35 mm format was sometimes called miniature format or small format, terms meant to distinguish it from medium <b>format</b> and <b>large</b> <b>format.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Wide <b>format</b> {{printers}} (<b>large</b> <b>format</b> printers) {{are generally}} accepted {{to be any}} computer-controlled printing machines (printers) that support a maximum print roll width of between 18" [...] and 100". Printers with capacities over 100" [...] wide are considered super wide or grand format. Wide format printers are used to print banners, posters, trade show graphics, wallpaper, murals, backlit film (duratrans), vehicle image wraps, electronic circuit schematics, architectural drawings, construction plans, backdrops for theatrical and media sets, and any other <b>large</b> <b>format</b> artwork or signage. Wide format printers usually employ some variant of inkjet technology to produce the printed image; and are more economical than other print methods such as screen printing for most short-run (low quantity) print projects, depending on print size, run length (quantity of prints per single original), {{and the type of}} substrate or print medium. Wide format printers are usually designed for printing onto a roll of print media that feeds incrementally during the print process, rather than onto individual sheets.|$|R
40|$|A {{solid board}} factory {{produces}} rectangular sheets of cardboard {{in two different}} <b>formats,</b> namely <b>large</b> <b>formats</b> and small formats. The production process consists of two stages separated by an inventory point. In the first stage a cardboard machine produces the <b>large</b> <b>formats.</b> In the second stage {{a part of the}} <b>large</b> <b>formats</b> is cut into small formats by a separate rotary cut machine. Due to very large setup times, technical restrictions, and trim losses, the cardboard machine is not able to produce these small formats. The company follows two policies to satisfy customer demands for rotary cut format orders. When the company applies the first policy, then for each customer order an ‘optimal’ <b>large</b> <b>format</b> (with respect to trim loss) is determined and produced on the cardboard machine. In case of the second policy, a stock of a restricted number of <b>large</b> <b>formats</b> is determined {{in such a way that}} the expected trim loss is minimal. The rotary cut format order then uses the most suitable standard <b>large</b> <b>format</b> from the stock. Currently, the dimensions of the standard <b>large</b> <b>formats</b> in the semi finished inventory are based on intuitive motives, with an accent on minimizing trim losses. From the trim loss perspective it is most efficient to produce each rotary cut <b>format</b> from a specific <b>large</b> <b>format.</b> On the other hand, if there is only one <b>large</b> <b>format</b> in each caliper, the variety is minimal, but the trim loss might be inacceptably high. On average, the first policy results in a lower trim loss. In order to make efficiently use of the two machines and to meet customer’s due times the company applies both policies. In this paper we concentrate on the second policy, taking into account the various objectives and restrictions of the company. The purpose of the company is to have not too many different types of <b>large</b> <b>formats</b> and an acceptable amount of trim loss. The problem is formulated as a minimum clique covering problem with alternatives (MCCA), which is presumed to be NP-hard. We solve the problem by using an appropriate heuristic, which is built into a decision support system. Based on a set of real data, the actual composition of semi finished inventories is determined. The paper concludes with computational experiments. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{resolution}} of film images {{depends upon the}} area of film used to record the image (35 mm, medium <b>format</b> or <b>large</b> <b>format)</b> and the film speed. Estimates of a photograph's resolution taken with a 35mm film camera vary. More information may be recorded if a fine-grain film, combined with a specially formulated developer, are used. Conversely, use of poor-quality optics or coarse-grained film yield lower image resolution. A 36mm × 24mm frame of ISO 100-speed film was initially estimated to contain the equivalent of 20 million pixels, although this estimate was later revised to between 4 and 16 million pixels {{depending on the type}} of film used. However, this has been challenged, and some estimate the amount of pixels on a single frame of 35mm film is over 40 megapixels. references needed, these are amateur blogs.is not the correct way to point out flaws in a wikipedia article, and it's very annoying regardless of the reader's point of view.|$|R
