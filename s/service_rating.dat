As {{a function of the}} queue lengths the <b>service</b> <b>rate</b> at each queue i is to be chosen in the interval [0, P], where cost ci(p) is charged for each unit of time that the <b>service</b> <b>rate</b> y is in effect at queue i.

40|$|Abstract We {{consider}} a server serving a time-slotted queued system of multi-ple packet-based flows, where {{not more than}} one flow can be serviced in a single time slot. The flows have exogenous packet arrivals and time-varying <b>service</b> <b>rates.</b> At each time, the server can observe instantaneous <b>service</b> <b>rates</b> for only a subset of flows (selected from a fixed collection of observable subsets) before scheduling a flow in the subset for service. We are interested in queue-length aware scheduling to keep the queues short. The limited availability of instanta-neous <b>service</b> <b>rate</b> information requires the scheduler to make a careful choice of which subset of <b>service</b> <b>rates</b> to sample. We develop scheduling algorithms that use only partial <b>service</b> <b>rate</b> information from subsets of channels, and that minimize the likelihood of queue overflow in the system. Specifically, we present a new joint subset-sampling and scheduling algorithm called Max-Exp that uses only the current queue lengths to pick a subset of flows, and sub...|$|R

Most previous {{studies on the}} storage allocation consider its effect separately either {{on the success of}} the data recovery or on the <b>service</b> <b>rate</b> (time) where it is assumed that no access failure happens in the system.

In particular, we focus on quasi-uniform storage allocation and provide a <b>service</b> <b>rate</b> analysis for both fixed-size and probabilistic access models at the nodes.
