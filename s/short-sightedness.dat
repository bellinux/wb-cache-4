5|$|Reviewers {{have noted}} that Brooks uses World War Z as a {{platform}} to criticize government ineptitude, corporate corruption, and human <b>short-sightedness.</b> At {{one point in the}} book, a Palestinian refugee living in Kuwait refuses to believe the dead are rising, fearing it is a trick by Israel. Many U.S. characters blame the United States' inability to counter the zombie threat on low confidence in their government due to conflicts in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|Lack of {{patronage}} led to Pentland folding his businesses {{and taking a}} job in 1930 as a pilot with Australian National Airways (ANA), a new airline founded by Charles Kingsford Smith and Charles Ulm. By 1932, ANA was in trouble as well, and Pentland left to set up as a dairy farmer on a property he bought at Singleton. Within two years, drought forced him to sell the land and he returned to earning his living as a pilot, instructing at aero clubs in Queensland and New South Wales. By late 1937, he was again employed as a transport pilot in New Guinea, where {{he was known as}} a practical joker who liked to hold a map {{in front of his face}} in apparent <b>short-sightedness</b> and ask his passengers if they could see a landing ground anywhere. He returned to Australia after war was declared in September 1939.|$|E
25|$|The lack of {{architectural}} features, and extensive street advertising, were also concerns. This {{was attributed to}} “materialism, apathy, <b>short-sightedness,</b> political interference and indifference”.|$|E
25|$|Near-sightedness, {{also known}} as <b>short-sightedness</b> and myopia, is a {{condition}} of the eye where light focuses in front of, instead of on, the retina. This causes distant objects to be blurry while close objects appear normal. Other symptoms may include headaches and eye strain. Severe near-sightedness {{increases the risk of}} retinal detachment, cataracts, and glaucoma.|$|E
25|$|Cecil Woodham-Smith {{claimed that}} while the export policy embittered the Irish, this did not {{implicate}} the policy in genocide, but rather in excessive parsimony obtuseness, <b>short-sightedness,</b> and ignorance. Irish historian Cormac O' Grada rejects the term, stating that the English exhibited no desire to exterminate the Irish and that the challenges for providing relief were enormous. W.D. Rubinstein also rejected the genocide claim.|$|E
25|$|In My Life and Work, Ford {{predicted}} that if greed, racism, and <b>short-sightedness</b> could be overcome, then economic and technological development {{throughout the world}} would progress {{to the point that}} international trade would no longer be based on (what today would be called) colonial or neocolonial models and would truly benefit all peoples. His ideas in this passage were vague, but they were idealistic.|$|E
25|$|I yield {{neither to}} Senator Borah nor {{to any other}} man in admiration of the Farewell Address and of the great Fathers of the Republic; but I would not use them as a cover for party politics. Never did I sneer at the Farewell Address; but I believe that the greatness of Washington was due to his looking the facts of his day in the face, and {{determining}} his conduct thereby, instead of by utterances, however wise of {{a hundred and fifty}} years before. I will trust the American people not to mistake <b>short-sightedness</b> for patriotism or narrow-mindedness for love of country.|$|E
25|$|Today's {{critics of}} Voltaire's opinion are {{directed}} primarily at his economic {{assessment of the}} Canadian colony. Voltaire’s idea of the Canadian colony based essentially on fur trade was, even {{at the time of}} his own writings, already outdated by almost a century. Thus, although it may be difficult to determine exactly what part of his depiction of Canada might be attributed to deliberate exaggeration for polemical purposes, to attachment to a preconceived idea or to mere misinformation, his few writings on the subject do seem to display a certain level of <b>short-sightedness</b> regarding the actual level of economic evolution that had, by then, already been reached in the settled parts of Canada and about the colony’s potential for further development.|$|E
25|$|The {{other major}} {{sticking}} point, which is reportedly causing concern at government level, {{is that the}} majority of people going to Potsdamer Platz are visitors to the city, implying that the original vision of the development as a linking element attracting Berliners themselves, and Berliners {{from both sides of the}} former divide, has not really materialised. There are criticisms that the development does not sit easily with or connect with its surroundings, and as a result Berliners have had difficulty accepting it as theirs (despite the fact that the choice of Hilmer & Sattler's masterplan was partly because it was the only one to address the way the development juxtaposed with the Cultural Forum immediately to the west, although the Cultural Forum has itself faced similar criticisms of its own). Another, more psychological factor that has played a part here is that a long-standing mutual distrust or antipathy felt between former East Berliners and West Berliners (Ossis and Wessis according to the well-known slang terms), is still very much in evidence in the city and elsewhere in Germany, and bold civil engineering projects and architectural statements are not going to make it go away by themselves. Politicians past and present have been accused of <b>short-sightedness</b> in speculating that they would.|$|E
500|$|Conservative MP Iain Macleod's 1961 {{biography}} of Chamberlain {{was the first}} major {{biography of}} a revisionist school of thought on Chamberlain. The same year, A. J. P. Taylor, in his The Origins of the Second World War, found that Chamberlain had adequately rearmed Britain for defence (though a rearmament designed to defeat Germany would have taken massive additional resources) and described Munich as [...] "a triumph for all that was best and most enlightened in British life... for those who had courageously denounced the harshness and <b>short-sightedness</b> of Versailles".|$|E
500|$|Marcus [...] "Mark" [...] Laurence Elwin Oliphant {{was born}} on 8 October 1901 in Kent Town, a suburb of Adelaide. His father was Harold George [...] "Baron" [...] Oliphant, a civil servant with the South Australian Engineering and Water Supply Department and {{part-time}} lecturer in Economics with the Workers' Educational Association. His mother was Beatrice Edith Fanny Oliphant, née Tucker, an artist. He was named after Marcus Clarke, the Australian author, and Laurence Oliphant, the British traveller and mystic. Most people called him Mark; this became official when he was knighted in 1959. He had four younger brothers, Roland, Keith, Nigel and Donald. His parents were theosophists, and as such were opposed to eating meat. Marcus became a lifelong vegetarian while a boy, after witnessing the slaughter of pigs on a farm. He {{was found to be}} completely deaf in one ear and he needed glasses for severe astigmatism and <b>short-sightedness.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On his {{day he was}} one of {{the fastest}} bowlers in world cricket, but his playing style was also notable for his <b>short-sightedness</b> and poor catching, his {{powerful}} throwing arm, his perceived profligacy with the ball and his undoubted ineptitude with the bat, with his batting and fielding being described as of [...] "court-jester standard".|$|E
2500|$|Prince Andrew {{was born}} at the Old Royal Palace in Athens on February 2, 1882, the fourth son of George I of Greece. He was taught English by his caretakers as he grew up, but in conversations with his parents he refused to speak {{anything}} but Greek. He also spoke German, Danish, Russian, and French. He attended cadet school and staff college at Athens, and was given additional private tuition in military subjects by Panagiotis Danglis. Despite his <b>short-sightedness,</b> [...] Andrew joined the army as a cavalry officer in May 1901.|$|E
2500|$|Wild {{retained}} {{a sense of}} bitterness about the federal government's <b>short-sightedness</b> that thwarted the project. He said: The thing that lost the project in the end {{was that we were}} asking for some very reasonable taxation arrangements which would apply {{in the early days of}} very heavy spending – in the long run we would be paying more taxes but we just wanted to ease the taxes during that early time – and that was knocked back by the government, in fact by the treasurer ... Paul Keating, and I would say that he is the man responsible for stopping [...] project." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1939, President Franklin Roosevelt {{called on}} Briggs, by then aged 65, {{to head the}} Advisory Committee on Uranium to {{investigate}} the fission of uranium, {{as a result of}} the Einstein–Szilárd letter. Even though Roosevelt had sanctioned a project, progress was slow and was not directed exclusively towards military applications. [...] Eugene Wigner said that [...] "We often felt we were swimming in syrup". [...] Boris Pregel said [...] "It is wonder that after so many blunders and mistakes anything was accomplished at all". [...] Leó Szilárd believed that the project was delayed for a least a year by the <b>short-sightedness</b> and sluggishness of the authorities. [...] At the time Briggs was not well and was due to undergo a serious operation. [...] He was unable to take the energetic action that was often needed.|$|E
2500|$|Reynolds {{challenged}} Brown to a duel in March 1855. [...] This duel never happened, however, as Brown chose [...] "the common American Rifle {{with open}} sights, round ball not over one ounce, at eighty yards." [...] Reynolds refused the terms because his <b>short-sightedness</b> {{would have put}} him at a severe disadvantage in making an accurate shot. [...] The public attacks continued and Brown, chafing under Reynolds' accusations of cowardice for his manipulation to avoid the original duel, finally issued a challenge. [...] Reynolds chose the more traditional dueling pistols and on August 26, 1856, the duel occurred on Bloody Island. Brown {{was shot in the}} leg (and was to walk with a limp {{for the rest of his}} life) while Reynolds was unscathed. Both returned to the political fray and Brown would serve as Governor of Missouri from 1871 to 1873.|$|E
2500|$|What was {{eventually}} approved was , {{much of it}} parceled out and disconnected. Florida donated , {{but it was only}} a quarter of what the park was supposed to encompass. Companies interested in mining rights held large swaths of land and insisted on making deals. Individual landowners continued to hold out for better prices. In , Marjory Stoneman Douglas alludes to [...] "all sorts of fraudulent schemes" [...] to solidify the land included in the park, of which Coe was one of many working for this goal. When the park was dedicated, Coe was bitterly disappointed in the final product and resigned from the committee in protest. It was considerably smaller than what he designed and he criticized the politicking and <b>short-sightedness</b> of the deals to make it happen. Only lands south of the Tamiami Trail were considered to be within the park boundaries, and Coe was concerned that the park could not survive if lands were drained or water was diverted north of the road. Although he refused to have anything {{more to do with the}} Everglades, when the park was dedicated in a ceremony attended by President Harry Truman, Coe sat on the stage with the president.|$|E
2500|$|Moreton {{believes}} that the rising criminality {{in the streets of}} London is a result of a late radical change in the English society, which seems to be pervaded by greed and hunger for power at all levels. The love for luxury and a public <b>short-sightedness</b> have shaped a new reality based on avarice and on criminal behaviour, as a consequence of [...] "our effeminacy, our toupee wigs, and powdered pates, our tea, and other scandalous fopperies". This shift towards greed and social ambition was not prerogative of the middle and upper classes but it could be retrieved even in the lower classes, eager to climb the social ladder. These criticisms are expressively restated in Defoe's Applebee articles: What can be said in Favour of that Luxury, which is not content with the Equipage of a Lord; a Coach and Six, a Revenue, with Servants and Establishments in proportion; but that, to have two Coaches and Six, and two Sets of Servants, and two Revenues, [...] would Mortgage Faith and Honour, Character and Principles, and even run the Risk of losing the Estate they had, and starving their Posterity? and even in his fictional works such as Moll Flanders and [...]|$|E
60|$|Never was the <b>short-sightedness</b> {{of human}} beings shown more distinctly, than when France wasted her {{strength}} and treasure in a sterile contest on the continent of Europe, and permitted, with scarce an effort, her North American colonies to be torn from her.|$|E
6000|$|There {{was a brief}} silence. Granet lounged {{a little}} back in his chair, but though his air of {{indifference}} was perfect, a sickening foreboding was creeping in upon him. He was conscious of failure, of blind, idiotic folly. Never before had he been guilty of such miserable <b>short-sightedness.</b> He fought desperately against the toils which he felt were gradually closing in upon him. There must be some way out! ...|$|E
60|$|Westville {{had always}} been a {{backward}} town, due mostly to the <b>short-sightedness</b> of Squire Paget, Mr. Hooker, the postmaster, and other narrow-minded leading men, who never saw fit to offer any inducements to manufacturers and others to locate there. The village consisted of half-a-dozen stores, a blacksmith shop, a tavern, and less than seventy-five houses. There was one hat factory there, but this was closed more than half the time.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of {{course you}} will do no such thing. I {{have never had a}} butler in the house before who suited me so well. It is a great credit to the man to have such a daughter, and I am not sure that we do not derive some lustre of a humble kind from his {{presence}} in the house. But, seriously, I wonder at your <b>short-sightedness,</b> when you know the troubles we have had through getting new men from nobody knows where.' ...|$|E
60|$|And here I must pause, {{to point}} out to you the <b>short-sightedness</b> of human contrivance. This ingenious young man, Mr. David Faux, thought he had {{achieved}} a triumph of cunning when he had associated himself in his brother's rudimentary mind with the flavour of yellow lozenges. But he had yet to learn that it is a dreadful thing to make an idiot fond of you, when you yourself are not of an affectionate disposition: especially an idiot with a pitchfork--obviously a difficult friend to shake off by rough usage.|$|E
60|$|Grey got angrily to his feet, {{rage and}} shame {{flushing}} his face, and it needed Ferguson and the Duke to restore him to {{some semblance of}} calm. Indeed, {{it may well be}} that it was to complete this that His Grace decided there and then that they should follow Grey's advice and go by way of Taunton, Bridgwater, and Bristol to Gloucester. He was, like all weak men, of conspicuous mental <b>short-sightedness.</b> The matter of the moment was ever of greater importance to him than any result that might attend it in the future.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{knock at}} the door, a moment or two later, and Bright entered. He was a little over medium height, with long and lanky figure, a {{pronounced}} stoop, and black, curly hair of coarse quality. His head, which was thrust a little forward, perhaps owing to his <b>short-sightedness,</b> was long, his forehead narrow, his complexion a sort of olive-green. He wore huge, disfiguring spectacles, and he had the protuberant lips of a negro. He greeted Catherine and the Bishop absently and seemed to have a grievance against Fenn.|$|E
60|$|He was {{overcome}} with wondering admiration of her courage, and of self-reproach {{at his own}} <b>short-sightedness.</b> This was the girl he had looked upon as a spoiled village beauty, satisfied with her small triumphs and provincial elevation, and vacant of all other purpose. Here was she--the all-unconscious heroine--and he her critic helpless at her feet! It was not a cheerful reflection, and yet he took a certain delight in his expiation. Perhaps he had half believed in her without knowing it. What could he do or say? I regret to say he dodged the question meanly.|$|E
60|$|There are {{occasions}} {{on which}} two servant-girls and a waggoner {{may be a}} formidable audience, and as the squire rode away on his black pony, even the gift of <b>short-sightedness</b> did not prevent him from being aware that Molly and Nancy and Tim were grinning not far from him. Perhaps he suspected that sour old John was grinning behind him--which was also the fact. Meanwhile the bull-dog, the black-and-tan terrier, Alick's sheep-dog, and the gander hissing {{at a safe distance}} from the pony's heels carried out the idea of Mrs. Poyser's solo in an impressive quartet.|$|E
60|$|This, at least, {{is one of}} our {{forms of}} opinion about Greek faith; not, indeed, {{possible}} altogether to any man of honesty or ordinary powers of thought; but still so venomously inherent in the modern philosophy that all the pure lightning of Carlyle cannot as yet quite burn it out of any of us. And then, side by side with this mere infidel folly, stands the bitter <b>short-sightedness</b> of Puritanism, holding the classical god to be either simply an idol,--a block of stone ignorantly, though sincerely, worshipped,--or else an actual diabolic or betraying power, usurping the place of god.|$|E

How {{do these}} hair-breadth escapes {{illustrate}} the unerring providence of God, and the <b>short-sightedness</b> of even pious Christians. It {{is easy to}} imagine the exclamations of a reflecting character when hearing of the marvelous escapes of this wicked youth. 'Dark providences! the good and benevolent are snatched away; but such a plague as this has his life preserved to pester us still. Short-sighted mortal, [...] "shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?"'

For all the purposes of growth, life, durability, and the final conversion of the vegetable matter into an element, the root is the seat of power and authority; and, in particular, the tap-root above or rather below all others. This tap-root may be termed the tail of vegetation. You may pluck fruits with impunity--nay, you may even top all the branches, and the tree shall survive; but, put the axe to the root, and the pride of the forest falls." ...|$|E
60|$|The latter {{entered a}} {{vigorous}} protest: he fought and he threatened: he promised de Marmont the hangman's rope {{and his men}} terrible reprisals, {{but of course he}} was fighting a losing battle. He was alone against five and twenty, his first attempt at getting hold of the pistols in his belt was met with a threat of summary execution: he was dragged out of the saddle, his arms were forced behind his back, while rough hands turned out the precious contents of his coat-pockets! All that he could do was to curse fate which had brought these pirates on his way, and his own <b>short-sightedness</b> and impatience in not waiting for the armed patrol which undoubtedly would have been sent out to him from Lyons in response to M. le Comte de Cambray's request.|$|E

Here, Agnes, I looked back at this house six years ago in a sort of despair. I was ready to reproach Providence, to reproach everything. I thought I saw my uncle's {{children}} in the way to be ruined, all his work undone, and there was I, unable to act, and yet with the responsibility of the care of them. I tell you, Agnes, I never was so wretched in my life. And yet what <b>short-sightedness!</b> There has Marian been, placed, like a witness of the truth, calm, firm, constant, guarding herself and her brother first, and then softening, and winning all that came under her influence." ...|$|E
60|$|But, indeed, an {{even worse}} fate, {{practically}} considered, {{follows from the}} denim of the original intellectual formula. Not only does the individual become narrow, but he spreads narrowness across {{the world like a}} cloud; he causes narrowness to increase and multiply like a weed. For what happens is this: that all the shortsighted people come together and build a city called Myopia, where they take <b>short-sightedness</b> for granted and paint short-sighted pictures and pursue very short-sighted policies. Meanwhile all the men who can stare at the sun get together on Salisbury Plain and do nothing but stare at the sun; and all the men who see a blue moon band themselves together and assert the blue moon, not once in a blue moon, but incessantly. So that instead of a small and varied group, you have enormous monotonous groups. Instead of the liberty of dogma, you have the tyranny of taste.|$|E

6000|$|Such is Syndicalism, {{the cheap}} Labour Panacea, {{to which the}} more passionate and less {{intelligent}} portion of the younger workers, impatient of the large constructive developments of modern Socialism, drifts steadily. It is the direct and logical reaction to our present economic system, which has counted our workers neither as souls nor as heads, but as hands. They are beginning to accept the suggestions of that method. It is the culmination in aggression of that, at first, entirely protective trade unionism which the individual selfishness and collective <b>short-sightedness</b> and State blindness of our owning and directing and ruling classes forced upon the working man. At first trade unionism was essentially defensive; {{it was the only}} possible defence of the workers, who were being steadily pressed over the margin of subsistence. It was a nearly involuntary resistance to class debasement. Mr. Vernon Hartshorn has expressed it as that in a recent article. But his paper, if one read it from beginning to end, displayed, compactly and completely, the unavoidable psychological development of the specialised labour case. He began in the mildest tones with those now respectable words, a [...] "guaranteed minimum" [...] of wages, housing, and so forth, and ended with a very clear intimation of an all-labour community.|$|E
