40|$|Objectives: The angled {{blade plate}} {{has been the}} {{historical}} standard in fixed-angle extramedullary subtrochanteric femur fracture fixation, but it requires an extensile lateral approach to the femur. Little formal evaluation exists for specifically designed percutaneous extramedullary implants. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare 3 locked plating constructs, all with percutaneous insertion capability, with the standard 95 -degree angled blade plate to determine whether specifically designed fixed-angle extramedullary implants for subtrochanteric femur fractures were biomechanically comparable to the angled blade plate.

40|$|Brush seals are {{comprised}} of fine diameter fibers densely packed between retaining and backing plates. To achieve seal compliance bristles {{are arranged to}} contact rotor with some lay angle. When axial pressure load is applied, bristles interlock and get stuck at the backing plate, and seal stiffness varies under operating conditions. Operating stiffness is critical to determine seal-rotor contact pressure and wear life. Typically, seal stiffness is measured by pressing a curved shoe to brush bore as reported in open literature. Due to the complex nature of pressure-stiffness bristle behavior, static and unpressurized measurements cannot represent actual working seal stiffness. This work presents a brush seal stiffness measurement system {{that is capable of}} measuring seal stiffness under working pressure and speed conditions.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{properties of the}} interface between frozen soils and structures are of importance in practice to the design and safety assessment of a frozen soil-structure system in permafrost regions and artificial frozen soils. In practice, frozen soil-structure interfaces are subjected to complex loading conditions and the surface roughness of a structure varies in a certain range. Their impacts on the cyclic direct shear behaviors of an artificial frozen soil-structure interface are interesting but unsolved issues. In this study, a series of direct shear tests were conducted to explore these impacts through characterizing the cyclic direct shear behaviors of an artificial frozen silt-structure interface. Particularly, these direct shear tests, which include monotonic shear tests, constant normal stress tests, and constant normal <b>stiffness</b> <b>tests,</b> were carried out under circumstances of different frozen temperatures and/or interface roughness. Shear stresses and normal stresses (or normal displacements) were measured under cyclic loading. These experiments revealed the following mechanical behaviors of the artificial frozen interface: (1) in monotonic shear tests, maximum shear stress is observed at the shear displacement of approximately 0. 7. mm. (2) The order {{of the magnitude of}} final shear stress from high to low is from constant normal stress tests, monotonic shear <b>tests,</b> constant normal <b>stiffness</b> <b>tests,</b> constant normal stress tests under rising temperature condition, and constant normal <b>stiffness</b> <b>tests</b> under rising temperature condition. (3) Both roughness and frozen temperature at shear have vital impacts not only on the maximum shear stress but also on the final shear stress. The roughness has much stronger impacts on the maximum shear stress than on the final shear stress. A critical roughness is observed from the relationship between the maximum shear stress and roughness. (4) Roughness, loading condition and cyclic loading time are three key factors to normal displacements. Both maximum dilation and final normal displacement increase with roughness increasing. The maximum dilation firstly increases with roughness increasing and then decreases from a certain roughness of about 0. 8. mm. However, the loading conditions have slightly different impacts on the final normal displacement from the maximum dilation...|$|R

Based on the soundboardâ€™s <b>stiffness</b> <b>test,</b> a brace from a collection of pre-dimensioned braces is chosen for that soundboard.

Design In vitro mechanical <b>stiffness</b> <b>testing</b> and finite element analysis. Methods From in vitro testing of proximal tibiae with defects, the stiffness of an internal stabilization system was determined. Using a finite element model, the loading of both the implant and bone was analyzed including all muscle forces. The variation in implant loading and interfragmentary strain for different defect locations was also investigated. Results Conventional <b>stiffness</b> <b>testing</b> demonstrated the comparability of the experimental findings with the finite element predictions. Under physiological-like loading the implant experienced high bending and von Mises stresses if defects in the region of the shaft were stabilized.

40|$|Background: Acetaminophen (also {{known as}} Tylenol or Paracetamol) {{is a very}} popular drug, that {{requires}} no prescription and is usually used as analgesic and antipyretic. A considerable number of previous studies show that acetaminophen has no effects that could alter exercise capacity or performance.

Purpose: The aim of our study was to check if acetaminophen influences reaction speed {{and power of the}} lower limbs muscles. Participants and method: For this study we recruited twenty-nine males, aged between 19 and 28 years old. We had two testing sessions for each participant, in the same day (the baseline evaluation, and the second evaluation at half an hour after acetaminophen ingestion). The evaluation sequence was: Body composition evaluation, acoustic-visual reaction test for one leg (left and right), Squad jump on one leg (5 jumps on each foot) and <b>Stiffness</b> <b>test</b> (7 jumps on each foot). Results: Acetaminophen has no significant influence on visual and acoustic reaction time of left or right leg. The Squat Jump test revealed a significant increase of explosive power on left leg (from 10. 19 Â± 1. 66 to 10. 61 Â± 1. 66 W/Kg, p= 0. 03) and right leg (10. 16 Â± 1. 59 W/Kg to 10. 62 Â± 1. 84 W/Kg, p= 0. 02).
