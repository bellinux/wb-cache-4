40|$|Background and Objective The <b>solitary</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>nodules</b> (SPNs) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{findings}} on chest radiographs. It becomes possible to provide more accurately quantitative information about blood flow patterns of <b>solitary</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>nodules</b> (SPNs) with multi-slice spiral computed tomography (MSCT). The aim of this study is to evaluate the correlation between the quantifiable parameters of blood flow pattern derived with dynamic CT in maliagnant <b>solitary</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>nodules</b> and tumor size. Methods 68 patients with maliagnant <b>solitary</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>nodules</b> (SPNs) (diameter <= 4 cm) underwent multi-location dynamic contrast material-enhanced (nonionic contrast material was administrated via the antecubital vein at a rate of 4 mL/s by an autoinjector, 4 * 5 mm or 4 * 2. 5 mm scanning mode with stable table were performed.) serial CT. Precontrast and postcontrast attenuation on every scan was recorded. Perfusion (PSPN), peak height (PHSPN) ratio of peak height of the SPN to that of the aorta (SPN-to-A ratio) and mean transit time(MTT) were calculated. The correlation between the quantifiable parameters of blood flow pattern derived with dynamic CT in maliagnant <b>solitary</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>nodules</b> and tumor size were assessed by means of linear regression analysis. Results No significant correlations were found between the tumor size and each of the peak height (PHSPN) ratio of peak height of the SPN to that of the aorta (SPN-to-A ratio) perfusion(PSPN) and mean transit time (r= 0. 18, P= 0. 14; r= 0. 20,P= 0. 09; r= 0. 01, P= 0. 95; r= 0. 01, P= 0. 93).

40|$|Abstract A solitary {{pulmonary}} nodule is a common, often incidental, radiographic finding. The {{investigation and}} differential diagnosis of <b>solitary</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>nodules</b> remain complex, {{because there are}} overlaps between the characteristics of benign and malignant processes. There are currently many strategies for evaluating <b>solitary</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>nodules.</b> The main objective is to identify benign lesions, {{in order to avoid}} exposing patients to the risks of invasive methods, and to detect cases of lung cancer accurately, in order to avoid delaying potentially curative treatment. The focus {{of this study was to}} review the evaluation of <b>solitary</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>nodules,</b> to discuss the current role of 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography, addressing its accuracy and cost-effectiveness, and to detail the current recommendations for the examination in this scenario...|$|E

Fifty two patients with <b>solitary</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>nodules</b> underwent CT examination using a GE Optima CT 660. The CT protocol included: 1) scan volume from the jugular notch to the end of the diaphragmatic dome; 2) location of the nodule in the lung; 3) scanning time for 30 sec, 1 min, 2 min, 4 min and 6 min following contrast agent injection. The image processing was carried out on an Advantage Workstation for Windows (AW 4. 5, GE Healthcare). The CT findings were verified by histology after CT-guided transthoracic biopsy of lung lesions and lung surgeries. Results. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of dynamic contract-enhanced CT were higher than those without dynamic CT (85, 95 and 92 % versus 71, 95 and 88 %, respectively) ...|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{review the}} {{radiological}} management of a <b>solitary</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>nodule.</b> Data sources. MEDLINE literature search (1958 - 2002). Study selection.

The <b>solitary</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>nodule</b> remains a perennial problem in radiological practice, particularly with current trends using low-dose computed tomography to screen for lung cancer. Determining the likelihood of malignancy forms {{the basis of the}} radiological approach of a <b>solitary</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>nodule.</b> Several factors that influence risk analysis include morphological and enhancement characteristics of the <b>solitary</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>nodule</b> on imaging, stability of the nodule, age of patient, smoking history, and history of malignant disease.

40|$|To quantitatively {{assess the}} value of dual-energy CT (DECT) in {{differentiating}} malignancy and benignity of <b>solitary</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>nodules.</b> Sixty-three patients with <b>solitary</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>nodules</b> detected by CT plain scan underwent contrast enhanced CT scans in arterial phase (AP) and venous phase (VP) with spectral imaging mode for tumor type differentiation. The Gemstone Spectral Imaging (GSI) viewer was used for image display and data analysis. Region of interest {{was placed on the}} relatively homogeneous area of the nodule to measure iodine concentration (IC) on iodine-based material decomposition images and CT numbers on monochromatic image sets to generate spectral HU curve. Normalized IC (NIC), slope of the spectral HU curve (λHU) and net CT number enhancement on 70 keV images were calculated. The two-sample t-test was used to compare quantitative parameters. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated to calculate sensitivity and specificity. There were 63 nodules, with 37 malignant nodules (59 %) and 26 benign nodules (41 %). NIC, λHU and net CT number enhancement on 70 keV images for malignant nodules were all greater than those of benign nodules. NIC and λHU had intermediate to high performances to differentiate malignant nodules from benign ones with the areas under curve of 0. 89 and 0. 86 respectively in AP, 0. 96 and 0. 89 respectively in VP. Using 0. 30 as a threshold value for NIC in VP, one could obtain sensitivity of 93. 8 % and specificity of 85. 7 % for differentiating malignant from benign <b>solitary</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>nodules.</b> These values were statistically higher than the corresponding values of 74. 2 % and 53. 8 % obtained with the conventional CT number enhancement.

40|$|The {{introduction}} into clinic of positron {{emission tomography}} (PET) with 18 F-Flurorodesoxyglucose (FDG) and of hybrid cameras combining PET and computed tomography (PET/CT) has radically changed the management of <b>solitary</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>nodules</b> (SPN). Three meta-analyses have shown a high diagnostic accuracy of FDG PET for the diagnosis of cancer in SPN. Small pulmonary nodules (less than 5 mm), respiratory movements and histology with low cell density and/or low metabolic activity {{are the most common}} cases of false negative FDG PET/CT. The majority of false positive cases are related to benign tumours, granulomatosis and infectious diseases. Likelihood ratio's (LR) of FDG PET/CT for overall prevalence of malignancy in SPN were published and are higher for malignancy diagnosis with PET scan in comparison with most clinical and radiological variables. Today, the Bayesian approach for SPN differential diagnosis must include information from FDG PET/CT. The increasing use of new radiotracers, such as octreotide derivates labeled with 68 Gallium (68 Ga) for diagnosis and staging of carcinoid tumours and the development of other radiotracers, will lead to an improvement in the management of <b>solitary</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>nodules.</b> SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

In total, 49 patients with radiologically indeterminate SPNs (single lesion ≤ 6 cm in diameter) were prospectively evaluated with MIBI. The final diagnosis was established with bronchoscopy, fine-needle aspiration, surgical resection or clinical follow-up for ≥ 2 yrs. A total of 12 (92 %) out of 13 malignant lesions showed increased uptake of MIBI, while no uptake was observed in 33 (92 %) out of 36 benign lesions.
