5|$|A {{growing number}} of African {{immigrants}} have made their homes in Omaha in the last twenty years. There are approximately 8,500 <b>Sudanese</b> living in Omaha, comprising the largest population of <b>Sudanese</b> refugees in the United States. Most have immigrated since 1995 because of warfare in their nation. Ten different tribes are represented, including the Nuer, Dinka, Equatorians, Maubans and Nubians. Most <b>Sudanese</b> people in Omaha speak the Nuer language. Other Africans have immigrated to Omaha as well, with one-third from Nigeria, and significant populations from Kenya, Togo, Cameroon and Ghana.|$|E
5|$|Amin began {{recruiting}} {{members of}} Kakwa, Lugbara, South <b>Sudanese,</b> and {{other ethnic groups}} from the West Nile area bordering South Sudan. The South <b>Sudanese</b> had been residents in Uganda since the early 20th century, having come from South Sudan to serve the colonial army. Many African ethnic groups in northern Uganda inhabit both Uganda and South Sudan; allegations persist that Amin's army consisted mainly of South <b>Sudanese</b> soldiers.|$|E
5|$|During {{most of the}} Second <b>Sudanese</b> Civil War (1983–2005) the gauging stopped, {{resuming}} in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Egypt gained full {{independence}} {{with the}} Egyptian Revolution of 23 July 1952 in which King Farouk was overthrown {{by a group}} of officers that included Gamal Abdel Nasser, later to emerge as the sole ruler in 1954. Sayyid Abd al-Rahman visited London and met the British Foreign Secretary Sir Anthony Eden on 11 November 1952. On 10 January 1953 the Egyptian government ratified an agreement with the Umma representatives and other pro-independence <b>Sudanese</b> parties that gave the <b>Sudanese</b> the right of self-determination. During a transition period no longer than three years parliamentary elections would be held and a <b>Sudanese</b> government formed. British and Egyptian troops and officials would leave the country and would be replaced by <b>Sudanese.</b>|$|E
5|$|Olver {{has been}} {{critical}} of the United States lack of involvement regarding the genocide in Darfur. Olver was one of five members of Congress arrested April 28, 2006 after protesting the genocide outside the <b>Sudanese</b> Embassy. Olver was arrested again in front of the <b>Sudanese</b> Embassy during a protest in 2012 along with other members of Congress and actor George Clooney.|$|E
5|$|On March 16, 2012, Moran {{was arrested}} outside the <b>Sudanese</b> embassy in Washington, DC, at {{a protest against}} human rights abuses perpetrated by the <b>Sudanese</b> government, {{specifically}} bombings in the Nuba Mountains and refusal to allow humanitarian aid organizations access to refugees. He was charged with disorderly conduct and released, along with George Clooney and several others.|$|E

5|$|During {{the colonial}} era, Mongalla was capital of Mongalla Province, which reached south to Uganda and east towards Ethiopia. On 7 December 1917 {{the last of}} the {{northern}} <b>Sudanese</b> troops were withdrawn from Mongalla, replaced by Equatorial troops. These southern and at least nominally Christian troops remained the only permanent garrison of the town and province until their mutiny in August 1955. Mongalla and the surrounding province was then absorbed into Equatoria Province in 1956. The town was taken and retaken more than once during the Second <b>Sudanese</b> Civil War (1983–2005).|$|E
5|$|Hunter's force {{advanced}} {{towards the}} town in a semi-circle formation, composed by the four battalions arranged {{from left to right}} in the following order: the 10th <b>Sudanese,</b> 9th <b>Sudanese,</b> the reduced 3rd Egyptian, and the 11th <b>Sudanese.</b> The artillery battery was with the 3rd Egyptian. The force reached the ridge of the plateau overlooking the town, about three hundred yards away, at a quarter past six. Major-General Hunter, finding the Mahdist garrison prepared for the assault and entrenched in their defenses, ordered the artillery to bombard their positions, which commenced at six-thirty. However, the artillery proved ineffective, as the guns were unable to strike within the narrow trenches or blast aside the cover behind which the Mahdist infantry waited. Hunter ceased the barrage, and ordered Lieutenant MacDonald to lead his brigade in a general advance. The command to fix bayonets was given, and the troops began an orderly advance across the three hundred yards that separated them from their objective. However, facing a line of Mahdist riflemen well-protected in their trenches, the soldiers of each advancing battalion were compelled to open fire without direct orders. The uncoordinated volleys of the advancing brigade were moderately effective against the Mahdist riflemen, who had not yet returned fire. When the battalions were about halfway across the three hundred yard stretch, their lines of fire began to converge due to their semi-circle formation, and the 10th <b>Sudanese,</b> on the left, was forced to halt to avoid coming under the fire of the rightmost 11th <b>Sudanese.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1937 Abd al-Rahman visited England and Egypt, {{where he}} met with {{high-ranking}} officials and with King Farouk. His purpose was to present <b>Sudanese</b> criticism of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty in person. He was openly critical of the Egyptian plans for unity of the Nile valley, which he considered unrealistic. In May 1937, his eldest son al-Siddiq al-Mahdi visited Egypt and was given a royal reception. These moves concerned the British, who saw them as potentially {{the start of a}} Mahdist alliance with Egypt, despite Abd al-Rahman's avowed <b>Sudanese</b> nationalism.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, a {{population}} of lions that was previously believed extirpated was filmed in the Alatash National Park, Ethiopia, close to the <b>Sudanese</b> border. This population may possibly number up to 200 animals.|$|E
5|$|In early January 1959, {{there were}} {{plans for a}} {{federation}} linking the <b>Sudanese</b> Republic with Senegal, Dahomey, and the Upper Volta in a federation of autonomous states. By April, however, neither Dahomey's nor Upper Volta's legislatures had ratified the federation, and so the Mali Federation was formed with only the <b>Sudanese</b> Republic and Senegal. In 1959, Modibo Keïta's RDA party won all 70 seats in the legislative elections in the <b>Sudanese</b> Republic and joined forces with the dominant party in Senegal, headed by Léopold Sédar Senghor. The federation achieved independence on 20 June 1960 within the French Community; however, divisions between Senghor and Keïta on the governance of the federation resulted in its dissolution on 20 August 1960. The area of French Sudan formally proclaimed itself the Republic of Mali and, with increasing radicalization of Keita, left the French Community in September 1960.|$|E
5|$|McGovern {{has been}} a {{prominent}} voice against the Islamist governments of Sudan for its prosecution {{of the war in}} Darfur. He {{has been a}}rrested twice during protests outside the <b>Sudanese</b> Embassy in Washington D.C. On April 28, 2006, he was one of five members of Congress arrested while protesting atrocities in the Darfur region. Also arrested were U.S. Representatives Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas), Jim Moran (D-Virginia), Rep. John Olver (D-Massachusetts), and Tom Lantos (D-California). McGovern was arrested again at the <b>Sudanese</b> embassy on April 27, 2009, this time accompanied by Reps John Lewis (D-Georgia), Donna Edwards (D-Maryland), Lynn Woolsey (D-California), and Keith Ellison (D-Minnesota). He was arrested again on March 16, 2012 alongside George Clooney during a protest outside of the <b>Sudanese</b> embassy speaking out against the Bashir regime in the Sudan.|$|E

5|$|The Chevron Corporation {{discovered}} the Adar Yale field in 1981, {{shortly before the}} start of the Second <b>Sudanese</b> Civil War (1983–2005). Soon after Chevron had suspended operations in 1984, <b>Sudanese</b> government troops began attacking civilian settlements in the area, burning the houses and driving the people away, and in the late 1990s, Nuer militias from Nasir helped the army in clearing away the people to make way for the roads and infrastructure of the oilfield.|$|E
5|$|The Second <b>Sudanese</b> Civil War {{finally ended}} in January 2005. However, Mongalla {{continued}} to suffer {{at the hands}} of the Lord's Resistance Army.|$|E
5|$|The troops {{selected}} for the operation were among the best soldiers in Kitchener's army: the 3rd Egyptian, 9th <b>Sudanese,</b> 10th <b>Sudanese,</b> and 11th <b>Sudanese</b> Battalions, composing Lieutenant Hector Archibald MacDonald's brigade. Additionally, Hunter's column included an artillery battery, containing six Krupp twelve-pounders, two Maxim guns, {{and a pair of}} older British machine guns, a Gardner and Nordenfelt. Finally, a single troop of cavalry was attached to the column along with a substantial supply of camels for transport and supply. The column had rations for eighteen days, and telegraph cable was supplied in the hope that constant communication could be ensured as the column made the 146 mile journey through the desert. Overall, the force numbered around 3600 soldiers.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the Turkish empire {{was broken}} up, {{leading to a}} revival of Egyptian nationalism. Some Egyptians claimed that Sudan was a natural {{extension}} of Egypt. The <b>Sudanese</b> view was mixed, with some wanting ties with Egypt to offset British influence and others wanting complete independence of Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Built in 1440, the Madrasa Gawhariyya {{contains}} {{the tomb of}} Gawhar al-Qanaqba'i, a <b>Sudanese</b> eunuch who became treasurer to the sultan. The floor of the madrasa is marble, the walls lined with cupboards, decoratively inlaid with ebony, ivory, and nacre. The tomb chamber is covered by small arabesque dome.|$|E
5|$|February 1994: A team of Libyans {{attacked}} bin Laden's home in Sudan. The CIA {{investigated and}} {{reported that they had}} been hired by Saudi Arabia, but Saudi Arabia accused them of lying to make bin Laden more amenable to <b>Sudanese</b> interests.|$|E
5|$|For example, Sudan’s {{famine in}} the 1980s was {{completely}} intentional, {{and was only}} a pawn for a varied collection of different elites to improve their political and economic statuses. These political parties weren’t the only beneficiaries, though. Merchants were also known to hoard grain and buy livestock at inappropriately low prices when the famines shifted the terms of trade. Western <b>Sudanese</b> merchants during the famine of 1987 were described as heartless because they refused to sell grain to needy villages in Darfur at reasonable prices. Ergo, the <b>Sudanese</b> Famine was another example of food power in which food was and used as a policy, and which completely ignored {{the needs of the}} people and fostered the political and power-hungry intentions of opposite warring forces in the country.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, {{he called}} for the United States and other {{countries}} to boycott the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China to protest the Chinese government's support of the <b>Sudanese</b> government and, by extension, the genocide in Darfur.|$|E
5|$|In April 2013, Witherspoon began {{production}} in Atlanta on Canadian director Philippe Falardeau's film The Good Lie. It {{is based on}} real-life events, about a brash American woman assigned to help four young <b>Sudanese</b> refugees (known as Lost Boys of Sudan) who win a lottery for relocation to the U.S. It was released on October 3, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Many educated <b>Sudanese</b> were {{suspicious}} of the Council and drifted towards the Khatmiyya side in the 1944 elections, not for religious reasons but because they were hostile to the government, wanted to retain links with Egypt as a counterpoise to British influence {{and did not want}} a monarchy under Sayyid Abd al-Rahman.|$|E
5|$|No South <b>Sudanese</b> athletes met the Olympic {{qualifying}} standards, but {{the nation}} was allotted three universality places to compete {{in track and field}} events. The South Sudan Athletics Federation nominated Marial, Santino Kenyi, and Mangar Makur Chuot to fill these spots. Eight days {{prior to the start of}} the Games, however, the South Sudan National Olympic Committee informed Chuot, who had already been accredited, by email that he had been removed from the team. Chuot was a refugee who had fled the Second <b>Sudanese</b> Civil War after the death of his father and been resettled in Australia in 2008. In 2014 he became the Australian 200 metre champion, but elected to compete for South Sudan rather than Australia at the Games. After his selection for the South <b>Sudanese</b> delegation was confirmed in December 2015, he returned to the country of his birth and became the 2016 South <b>Sudanese</b> 100 and 200 m champion, setting a national record in the latter discipline. The NOC chose Margret Hassan, a competitor in the 200 m event, to take his spot, despite another athlete, national record holder Viola Lado, having posted a better time in the lead up to the Olympics. When the Athletics Federation protested, the NOC claimed that Samsung, who had featured Hassan in one of their advertisements, had pressured the organization to give her one of the spots, an accusation that Samsung denied. When his appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport was rejected, Chuot proclaimed his decision to leave the sport.|$|E

5|$|Roosevelt's {{expedition}} reached Mongalla {{at the end}} of February, {{coming from}} the Belgian Congo via the Lado Enclave. He was impressed by the Egyptian and <b>Sudanese</b> troops, but when visiting a native dance he commented on the lack of middle-aged men, a result of the Mahdist wars that had ended over ten years ago.|$|E
5|$|South Sudan gained its {{independence}} from Sudan in 2011, but the South <b>Sudanese</b> Civil War {{made it difficult for}} the nation to garner the support of five sport federations as required for its National Olympic Committee to gain recognition by the International Olympic Committee. Guor Marial, a South <b>Sudanese</b> refugee living in the United States, competed in the men's marathon at the 2012 Summer Olympics, but did so as an Independent Olympic Athlete after refusing to compete for Sudan. South Sudan became the 206th IOC member in August 2015, with the affiliations of track and field, basketball, association football, handball, judo, table tennis, and taekwondo. The nation chose Marial at its flagbearer for both the opening and closing ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|The army {{grew from}} 10,000 to 25,000 by 1978. Amin's army {{was largely a}} {{mercenary}} force. Half the soldiers were South <b>Sudanese</b> and 26 percent Congolese, with only 24 percent being Ugandan, mostly Muslim and Kakwa.|$|E
5|$|The {{sultan of}} Darfur Ali Dinar had been reïnstated by the British after their {{victory in the}} Mahdist War but during the First World War he grew restive, refusing his {{customary}} tribute to the <b>Sudanese</b> government and showing partiality to the Ottoman Empire in 1915.|$|E
5|$|American {{officials}} later {{acknowledged that}} the evidence cited by the U.S. in its rationale for the Al-Shifa strike was weaker than initially believed: The facility had not been involved in chemical weapons production, and was not connected to bin Laden. The $30 million Al-Shifa factory, which had a $199,000 contract with the UN under the Oil-for-Food Programme, employed 300 <b>Sudanese</b> and provided {{over half of the}} country's pharmaceuticals, including medicines for malaria, diabetes, gonorrhea, and tuberculosis. A <b>Sudanese</b> named Salah Idris purchased the plant in March 1998; while the CIA later said it found financial ties between Idris and the bin Laden-linked terrorist group Egyptian Islamic Jihad, the agency had been unaware at the time that Idris owned the Al-Shifa facility. Idris later denied any links to bin Laden and sued to recover $24 million in funds frozen by the U.S., {{as well as for the}} damage to his factory. Idris hired investigations firm Kroll Inc., which reported in February 1999 that neither Idris nor Al-Shifa was connected to terrorism.|$|E
5|$|Amin {{recruited}} {{his followers}} {{from his own}} ethnic group, the Kakwas, along with South <b>Sudanese.</b> By 1977, these three groups formed 60 percent of the 22 top generals and 75 percent of the cabinet. Similarly, Muslims formed 80 percent and 87.5 percent of these groups {{even though they were}} only 5 percent of the population. This helps explain why Amin survived eight attempted coups.|$|E
5|$|Formed at a {{time when}} the British Empire was {{reaching}} its peak, the regiment served all over the Empire, in times of both peace and war, and in many theatres of war outside the Empire. It fought with distinction in World War I and World War II, as well as in other smaller conflicts around the world. These other wars included the Second <b>Sudanese</b> War, the Second Boer War, the Anglo-Irish War and the Third Anglo-Afghan War.|$|E
5|$|In 1919 Sayyid Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi {{was among}} a {{delegation}} of <b>Sudanese</b> notables who went to London to congratulate King George V of England on the British victory in the war. In a dramatic gesture of loyalty, Abd al-Rahman presented the Mahdi's sword to the King. The delegation was led by Sayyid Ali al-Mirghani, {{the leader of the}} Khatmiyya movement, who was later to clash with Abd al-Rahman over several issues.|$|E
