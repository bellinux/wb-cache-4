He made a living from teaching and appearances at haikai parties until late August 1693, when he shut the gate to his bashō hut and refused to <b>see</b> <b>anybody</b> for a month.

Several years later, he said, [...] "It {{was very difficult to}} accept. I had been in the organization. I had worked my way up to the big leagues. I spent my life with the Orioles."
