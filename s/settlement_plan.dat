5|$|The Kangchu system {{facilitated}} {{the growth of}} the gambier and pepper plantations and developed Johor's and Singapore's economies in the 19th century. The development of Johor's inland towns were attributed to the efforts by the various Kangchu, who were responsible for drawing the <b>settlement</b> <b>plan</b> for the coolies living within the plantation they were working on, from which new towns were formed. The Chinese immigrant population in Johor and Singapore grew in size during this period; Riau also experienced a similar growth during the 18th century. As a result of mass immigration by the Chinese into Johor, the Chinese quickly outnumbered the Malays in the state, although many Chinese coolies relocated to Singapore or other parts of Malaya as the gambier and pepper industry declined in the 20th century. Several towns and other places in Johor and Singapore, built upon sites of former gambier and pepper plantations, are named after former features of the Kangchu system, and are largely populated by ethnic Chinese.|$|E
5|$|According to Bruce, {{men were}} needed to allow Australia's {{extensive}} resources to be developed. In 1923, much of Australia's land was virtually unoccupied, and Bruce believed Australia {{had the potential to}} be one of the most fertile and productive nations in the world, which could sustain populations upward of 100 million over time more than 16 times the population of his time. Despite dissenting voices from scientists, who noted that poor climate, soils and water availability were significant barriers to large populations, the Bruce-Page government enacted policies to encourage large numbers of British to migrate to Australia. Under the auspices of the new Development and Migration Commission, £34 million in loans took place over the decade starting in 1924 to facilitate immigrant settlement through improvements to rural infrastructure, land access, and subsidising immigrant journeys ("passages"). Estimates as high as half a million British immigrants over ten years were predicted at the start of the policy, whereas just over 200,000 travelled to Australia during that time period. Bruce's <b>settlement</b> <b>plan</b> rested on rural growth. Migrants were often selected on the basis of their willingness to work on the land; state and Commonwealth governments concentrated their investment on rural development and encouraged returned servicemen to take up farms on the periphery of settled areas. Despite this, a majority of these migrants settled in urban areas, as Australia's rural areas were far more remote and difficult to work (than for example England's) and many of those taking advantage of the assistance scheme were urban workers or family and friends of those already settled. Immigration from outside Great Britain and her dominions was considered unpalatable the Bruce government upheld the White Australia policy by placing strong restrictions on immigration from other areas, notwithstanding its population growth targets.|$|E

The plan would have created a United Cyprus Republic consisting of a Greek Cypriot constituent state and a Turkish Cypriot constituent state linked by a federal government. More than half of the Greek Cypriots who were displaced in 1974 and their descendants would have had their properties returned to them and would have lived in them under Greek Cypriot administration within a period of 31/2 to 42 months after the entry into force of the settlement. For those whose property could not be returned, they would have received monetary compensation.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, {{members of the}} Missouri General Assembly and Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon again began attacking the {{desegregation}} plan {{on the grounds of}} its costs. Nixon proposed that instead of spending money to transfer students, funds would be better spent improving derelict conditions in city schools, a view supported by St. Louis's first black mayor, Freeman Bosley, Jr.. After another legal challenge to the plan in early 1996 (based on recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings), the court ordered a review of the plan and a second settlement agreement. A <b>settlement</b> <b>plan</b> developed in the Missouri legislature called for reduced state money for the program and a focus only on funding magnet schools in the city and the voluntary transfer program. All but one of the suburban districts agreed to renew the agreement on these terms (Ladue School District was the exception), and in 1999, the renewed settlement was established. However, under the 1999 agreement, school districts have been permitted to withdraw from the voluntary transfer program starting in 2002, and two districts have done so (Lindbergh School District and Pattonville School District). A five-year extension of the voluntary transfer program was approved in 2007, allowing new enrollments to take place through the 2013–2014 school year in participating districts.|$|E

He was joined by the two Karabakh Armenians in the government: Prime Minister Kocharyan and Interior and National Security Minister Serzh Sargsyan. These three politicians were referred to as [...] "hardliners" [...] in the Western media for their perceived nationalistic stance. They argued that [...] "Armenia should try to improve its economic performance," [...] while Ter-Petrosyan insisted that Armenia [...] "could only achieve marginal improvements insufficient to address the fear of relative decline and economic exclusion." [...] The Kocharyan cabinet, where Vazgen Sargsyan was a leading figure, called for a [...] "package" [...] deal, [...] "involving a single framework accord on all contentious issues." [...] On 21 October 1997, ten members of the Republic bloc in the parliament left the faction and shifted their support to Vazgen Sargsyan. Ter-Petrosyan's bloc in the parliament was left with a majority of two seats. Despite the great public and political opposition, the Pan-Armenian National Movement voted in favor of Ter-Petrosyan's foreign policy.|$|E

500|$|Until {{the late}} 1990s, Highway3 formed a single {{continuous}} [...] route from the Ambassador Bridge to near the Peace Bridge, {{but since then}} has had significant portion transferred to regional and county governments. A {{large segment of the}} route follows the historic Talbot Trail, a settlement road following the northern shore of Lake Erie constructed by Colonel Talbot in the early 1800s as part of a grand <b>settlement</b> <b>plan</b> along the lake front. East of Canborough, the road generally follows older settlement trails: Forks Road, connecting Dunnville with Wainfleet, portions of Sherk's Road, through Port Colborne to Gasline, and the Garrison Road, a military road built west from Fort Erie. The highway was initially designated in 1920, but not numbered until five years later. It originally connected to Niagara Falls, but was rerouted to Fort Erie following completion of the Peace Bridge in the late 1920s. Although a few portions of Highway3 were upgraded in the years since, the highway generally follows the same route as it did in 1930. However, in 1997, segments through Port Colborne and Fort Erie were decommissioned as a provincial highway, followed by a segment of the route from Leamington to Talbotville Royal in 1998. All three now exist as county/regional roads. The portion of Highway3 along Huron Church Road in Windsor was reconstructed as part of the Windsor–Essex Parkway project between 2011 and 2015.|$|E
