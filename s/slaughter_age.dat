Eighteen Italian Heavy Draught Horse (IHDH) foals were used for the trial. They were subdivided in three groups according to their <b>slaughtering</b> <b>age</b> (6, 11 and 18 months). Two different surfaces were investigated for each sample: daily renewed cutting surface (DRCS) and not-renewed cutting surface (NRCS). The redness of both the investigated surfaces increased with <b>slaughtering</b> <b>age</b> (P < 0. 01). Moreover, this parameter decreased during post-thawing time (P < 0. 01) only on the NRCS, probably for the myoglobin oxidation processes.

Eighteen male Italian heavy draught horse (IHDH) breed foals were employed in the study. Soon after foaling they were randomly subdivided in 3 groups according to 3 <b>age</b> at <b>slaughtering</b> classes: 6 months old, 11 months old and 18 months old. Live weight, hot carcass weight and dressing percentage of each animal were recorded. After slaughtering, meat samples were collected from Longissimus Dorsi muscle between 13 th and 18 th thoracic vertebra of each animal and then analyzed. The right half carcass of each animal was then divided in cuts. Each one was subdivided into lean, fat and bones. Then, the classification of the lean meat in first and second quality cuts was performed according to the butchers’ customs. Older animals were characterized by a lower incidence of first quality cuts (p< 0. 01) on carcass. Younger animals showed greater content in protein (p< 0. 01). Fatty acid profile showed an increasing trend of PUFA connected to the increasing of <b>slaughtering</b> <b>age</b> (p< 0. 05). The unsaturation index of intramuscular fatty acids was not affected by <b>slaughtering</b> <b>age,</b> confirming that horse meat, if compared to beef, is more suitable from a nutritional point of view.

After the usual commercial ageing period for Chianina carcasses, longissimus thoracis, semitendinosus and triceps brachii muscles were taken and analyzed instrumentally for pH, meat color, water holding capacity, tenderness and chemical composition. To compare the quality characteristics of the three muscles at different age, all data were subdivided in two groups: <b>slaughtering</b> <b>age</b> 18 - 19 months (n= 25) and 20 - 21 months (n= 23). Quality characteristics of meat derived from the three muscles analyzed were different: semitendinosus muscle showed higher values of Lightness (L*) and Hue (H*), thus lighter and paler meat, but was less tender and had a higher cooking loss. Meat derived from triceps brachii muscle had the lowest values of Lightness (L*) and Hue (H*) thus meat slightly darker; with regard to the other quality parameters, longissimus thoracis gave more tender meat with better water holding capacity than triceps brachii. The meat analyzed had a very low content of intramuscular fat (expressed as ether extract (%)), a very well-known characteristic of Chianina meat. The comparison between meat derived from 18 - 19 month old beef and from 20 - 21 month old beef shows that only redness (a*) and Chroma (C*) increased significantly with the increase in <b>slaughtering</b> <b>age,</b> but these results do not induce differences in meat color appreciation, as shown by the similar values of Lightness (L*) and Hue (H*).

The parameters evaluated were the pH change during slaughtering (during rigor mortis development) and carcass characteristics in terms of dressed weights, dressing percentage, organ weights, physical cuts and meat/bone ratio to establish practice viability. On the average, it took the rabbit meat 4. 76 hours to attain the ultimate pH of 5. 69 at 2 ± 2 C. The dressed carcass weight, ono the average was 47. 9 % of live weight. Dressed carcass percentage was significantly influenced by <b>slaughter</b> <b>age</b> with rabbit slaughtered at 10 weeks having lower value than that of 13 and 16 weeks slaughter ages. <b>Slaughter</b> <b>age</b> influenced the absolute weight of each physical cut.

40|$|In {{practice}} cattle may be slaughtered {{at different}} combinations of age and weight. As each of these factors could affect meat quality traits, the present work aimed to identify which combination {{can be expected to}} increase overall meat quality of m. rectus abdominis of Charolais heifers. Totally, 40 heifers were slaughtered either at 26 +/- 1 or at 36 +/- 1 months of age. Young heifers were sampled at two different carcass weights (349 +/- 12 and 394 +/- 8 kg). Old heifers were also sampled at two different carcass weights (397 +/- 6 and 451 +/- 9 kg). The m. rectus abdominis was excised 24 h postmortem to determine metabolic enzyme activities, myosin heavy-chain isoform proportions, lipid contents, collagen content and collagen solubility. Shear force measurements were evaluated on raw and broiled meat after 14 days of ageing. Meat quality traits scored between 0 and 10 by sensory analysis. Increasing <b>slaughter</b> <b>age</b> from 26 to 36 months had no impact on either raw/broiled shear force (0. 31 <= P <= 0. 47) and/or meat quality traits (0. 62 <= P <= 0. 91) or on physicochemical properties of heifer's meat samples. Increasing carcass weight for a similar <b>slaughter</b> <b>age</b> of 26 months had also impact neither on meat quality traits (0. 52 <= P <= 0. 91) nor on muscular properties. On the contrary, increasing carcass weight for a similar <b>slaughter</b> <b>age</b> of 36 months had induced a decrease of muscular shear force (raw muscle; P= 0. 009) and a concomitant decrease of total collagen content (P= 0. 03). Nevertheless, no significant impact on meat quality traits was revealed by the sensorial panel (0. 13 P 0. 49). Metabolic enzyme activities (0. 13 <= P <= 0. 86) and myosin heavy-chain proportions (0. 13 <= P <= 0. 96) were not significantly impacted by <b>slaughter</b> <b>age</b> and carcass weight. Thus, the impact of increasing carcass weight and/or <b>slaughter</b> <b>age</b> in young Charolais heifers has a limited impact on meat quality traits and associated muscular characteristics. Modulating heifer's cycles (age and/or carcass weight in the studied range) appears to be a way to answer to the numerous marketing chains, without penalising meat quality traits...|$|E

Because {{of the apparent}} impact of age on prevalence of these organisms, studies of <b>slaughter</b> <b>age</b> pigs are important when considering the potential for contamination of food. This study evaluated C. difficile and MRSA shedding by <b>slaughter</b> <b>age</b> pigs from farms across Canada. Results Clostridium difficile was isolated from 30 / 436 (6. 9 %) samples from 15 / 45 (33 %) farms. After adjusting for clustering at the herd level, the prevalence was 3. 4 %. Ribotype 078 (toxinotype V, North American Pulsotype 7) {{was the most common}} strain, accounting for 67 % of isolates. MRSA was isolated from 21 / 460 (4. 6 %) pigs from 5 / 46 (11 %) farms. The prevalence in pigs after adjusting for clustering at the herd level was 0. 2 %. Seven different spa types were identified, with 3 related spa types (t 011, t 034, new) accounting for 16 (76 %) consistent with ST 398 predominating. Both MRSA and C. difficile samples were collected from 45 farms. Both MRSA and C. difficile were detected on 2 (4. 4 %), with C. difficile only on 13 (29 %), MRSA only on 3 (6. 7 %) and neither on 27 (60 %). Conclusions The prevalence of C. difficile and MRSA in <b>slaughter</b> <b>age</b> pigs was relatively low, particularly in comparison with studies involving younger pigs. The predominance of C. difficile ribotype 078 and MRSA ST 398 was not surprising, but there was diversity in strain types and the majority of isolates of both organisms were strains that can be found in humans. While the prevalence of C. difficile and MRSA in <b>slaughter</b> <b>age</b> pigs was relatively low, there is clearly potential for contamination of meat from healthy pigs carrying this pathogen into slaughterhouses. </p...|$|E

In this study we assessed the persistence through to <b>slaughter</b> <b>age</b> of wounds inflicted on the skins of ostrich chicks at ages 1, 4, 7, 10 and 13 months. Superficial and deep wounds were investigated by either scratching the skin with a nail, or by cutting through the skin with a scalpel blade. Experimental animals were slaughtered at either 11 or 14 months of age and visible scars were assessed on the processed skins. The length and surface area of each scar were measured to obtain an adjusted scar size. Orientation of lacerations (dorso-ventral or anterior-posterior) proved to be unimportant. Cut wounds were persistent to slaughter as were scratch marks, with {{only a small percentage of}} scratch wounds incurred at a young age not persisting to <b>slaughter</b> <b>age.</b> Mean scar size at slaughter became smaller with an increase in age at which the wounds were inflicted, except at 13 months of age where it was assumed that the wounds had not had sufficient time to heal properly.

50|$|The 25th {{district}} located entirely within Monroe County, {{centered on}} the city of Rochester. The incumbent is Democrat Louise Slaughter, who has represented the district since 2013, and previously represented the 28th district from 1993 to 2013 and the 30th district from 1987 to 1993. She was re-elected in 2014 with 49% of the vote and the district has a PVI of D+7. Due to <b>Slaughter's</b> <b>age,</b> recent health problems, {{and the death of}} her husband, there has been speculation that she might retire. She has not ruled out running again.|$|R
40|$|The aim was {{to verify}} organic system effect on carcass and meat quality of beefs. Twelve {{carcasses}} derived from Limousine x Red Pied beef, reared in the San Rossore Park (Tuscany) and slaughtered at 24 months of age, were used. After 24 h post-mortem, carcasses were evaluated according to UE classification grid: on right half carcasses several measurements were taken and carcass compacteness was calculated. After 7 days of ageing longissimus thoracis, semitendinosus and triceps brachii muscles were analysed for pH, meat colour, water holding capacity, tenderness, chemical composition, fatty acid and cholesterol content. Results underlined the good quality of meat obtained from organic system in terms of colour, tenderness, water holding capacity and suitability for domestic storage. The meat had a low content of intramuscular fat; atherogenic and thrombogenic indices were rather high, testifying the high saturated fatty-acids content, probably due both to the inadequate finishing period, both to the high <b>slaughtering</b> <b>age.</b> An appropriate finishing period, in respect of the organic guidelines, should anticipate <b>slaughtering</b> <b>age</b> and improve carcass performance, obtaining higher intramuscular fat, and perhaps lower atherogenic and thrombogenic indices. Semitendinosus appeared agreeable due to its paler and lighter meat, but was less tender and had worst water holding capacity; instead longissimus thoracis and triceps brachii, although slightly darker, gave meat more tender and with better water holding capacity...|$|R

40|$|Forty lambs of two Italian dairy breeds {{were used}} to {{study the effects of}} <b>slaughter</b> <b>age</b> and breed on meat fatty acid composition. Lambs were {{subdivided}} into four groups (n. 10) according to a factorial scheme of two breeds (Leccese and Comisana). ×. two slaughter ages (45 and 60 days). The lambs were fed maternal milk supplemented with hay and concentrate from the 30 th day to the slaughter. Leccese lambs at 45 days exhibited a FA profile more compatible to nutritional requirements for human health. They displayed a lower SFA proportion, a higher UFA/SFA and MUFA/SFA ratios than Comisana. The delay of slaughtering age at 60 days improved FA composition in Comisana lambs which had lower SFA content, AI and TI indexes and higher UFA/SFA and MUFA/SFA ratios and n- 3 PUFA content than in Leccese. In both the breeds, the <b>slaughter</b> <b>age</b> at 60 days improved the CLA content...|$|E

40|$|The meat {{quality of}} ducks were studied in {{relationship}} to two different rearing technologies(whole inside a poultry house; the first period in poultry house and the second period, from 29 days to <b>slaughtering</b> <b>age,</b> in pens at open air. Muscovy ducks and Common ducks {{were used for the}} trial. a sample of each species, reared under the two systems, was slaughtered (11 weeks MD males, 9 weeks MD females, 8 weeks both sexes of CD and 10 weeks mulards). Results showed that the system which imposed the open air period did not determine a reduction of growth speed, on the contrary males and Mulards improved their growth. No statistical differences were observed between slaughtering traits {{in relationship to}} the systems of rearing. Mulards showed carcass traits more similar to MD males (ready to cook carcass incidence was 63 %, 65 % and 58 % in mulards, in MD males and in both sexes of CD, respectively). Breast muscles rate was higher in mulards than MD males, MD females and both sexes of CD (23 % vs 20 %, 17 % and 17 - 18 %) Abdominal fat incidence decreased with age and at traditional <b>slaughtering</b> <b>ages</b> was very low: mulards 0, 8 %, MD females 2, 7 %, MD males 1, 5 %, CD 1, 3 - 2, 2 %. dry matter of breast muscle was higher in mulards than in MD and CD.
