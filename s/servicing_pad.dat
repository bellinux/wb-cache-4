50|$|A pad site or outparcel is a {{freestanding}} {{parcel of}} {{commercial real estate}} located {{in the front of}} a larger shopping center or strip mall. Desirable because of their visibility to consumers, accessibility, and the ease of facilitating drive-thru <b>service,</b> <b>pad</b> sites are typically sought after by banks, casual dining, and fast food restaurants. Pad sites usually range between 2,000 and 75,000 square feet (2000 and 75000 sq ft). They can be ground leased by developers or purchased outright. The former offers a lower up-front cost, but the user is unable to use the land as collateral to finance building expenses because pad sites do not have their own legal address. The latter requires a larger capital investment, but provides the user an appreciable asset in real estate.|$|R

40|$|Antimony trisulfide (Sb 2 S 3) {{is used as}} a {{lubricant}} in friction material. X-ray diffraction {{analysis revealed}} Sb in 3 / 3 disc brake pads (range 41, 000 - 46, 000 mg/kg) and in 2 / 2 disc brake dust samples (21, 000 and 17, 000 mg/kg) from trucks. Considerably lower concentrations were found in drum brake pads (3 / 5, 59 - 6400 mg/kg) and in drum brake dust (4 / 18, 78 - 2800 mg/kg). Other toxic metals were also detected in pads and dust. The health risk of Sb in particulate brake emissions should be dependent on particle size and chemical entity, in particular solubility. A significant amount of the emitted dust was shown by size-fractionated optical particle counting to be inhalable in environmental (> 90 % mass) and occupational (> 50 % mass) exposure situations. Differentiation via selective solubility showed a considerable amount of Sb 2 S 3 to oxidize during the braking process, likely leading to the formation of Sb 2 O 3, a suspected human carcinogen. Sb in brake dust was soluble in calf serum (8. 5 +/- 1. 2 %, 8. 9 +/- 1. 7 mg/l at 37 degreesC for 3 d). Hence, the use of Sb in friction material should be suspected to pose a human cancer risk and be deterred.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of corruption {{should not be}} viewed in isolation, {{but as part of}} the broader issue of governance and public management. The international community’s recognition in the late 1990 s of the corrosive effect of corruption is a logical extension of the link between governance and development created earlier in the decade. Corruption has occurred from the earliest of time and in all societies. Virtually every aspect of public administration, and public finance, can be a source of corruption – large procurements and major public works projects, tax administration, debt management, customs and ill-designed privatization of state owned enterprises. Definitions of corruption can be extremely complex. The simplest definition is, “Corruption is the misuse of public or private office for personal gain. ” 1 In particular, it is widely believed that weaknesses in information and control systems in developing country bureaucracies, and lack of transparency and accountability within the legal and political systems have given rise to cost <b>padding,</b> <b>service</b> diversions and corruption.

50|$|In disc brakes, {{there are}} usually two brake pads per disc rotor. These are held in place and {{actuated}} by a caliper affixed to the wheel hub or suspension upright. Most vehicles have two brake pads per caliper. However racing calipers can utilize up to six pads, with varying frictional properties in a staggered pattern for optimum performance.Depending on {{the properties of the}} material, disc wear rates may vary. The brake pads must usually be replaced regularly (depending on pad material) to prevent brake fade. Most brake pads are equipped with a method of alerting the driver when this needs to be done. A common technique is manufacturing a small central groove whose eventual disappearance by wear indicates the end of a <b>pad's</b> <b>service</b> life. Others methods include placing a thin strip of soft metal in a groove, such that when exposed (due to wear) the brakes squeal audibly and embedding a soft metal tab in the pad material that closes an electric circuit and lights a dashboard warning light when the brake pad wears thin.|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Accidents involving commercial vehicles have disastrous consequences; most of the times they result in human fatalities, environmental damage, traffic congestion leading to fuel wastage and associated productivity losses. Moreover, with the rapid increase in the commercial vehicles traffic over the past few years, improved preventive and active measures are necessary to minimize commercial vehicle accidents and to enhance the safety of our roadways. The brake system is one of the critical components in ensuring the safety of the vehicle on the road. In a recent National Traffic Safety Board's (NTSB) heavy truck inspection survey, {{it was found that the}} defects in brakes/brake adjustment account for an average 56 percent of the trucks being declared out of <b>service.</b> Worn brake <b>pads</b> and tires, air leaks at hoses, connections, valves and brake chambers of the airbrake system along with the significant time delay in the actuation of tractor and trailer brakes degrade the vehicle braking and handling performance thereby increasing the potential for fatal accidents. As a result, there is a need for the advanced diagnostic system that monitors the health of air brakes and thus aiding in preventing the accidents. Therefore, the research is to develop a diagnostic algorithm that enhance the preventive safety of the vehicle. This could be accomplished by developing a mathematical model for the air brake system of a commercial vehicle and then utilizing the fault detection algorithms using analytical redundancy in a dynamic system. This could be done by predicting the redundant measurements using some of the reliable sensors and comparing with that of the values from the model. Using the mismatch between these, error residuals can be generated that carry the signature of the health of the airbrake system. The algorithm could also be experimentally implemented and verify their efficacy on an air brake system in the laboratory. The focus of the work that is presented here is to develop a mathematical model of the air brake systems that suits the development of the diagnostic algorithm and also to set up a test bench for the experiments...|$|R
