It opens with a blurred long <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band sitting on a couch, and as the music starts, it has them performing in a warehouse surrounded with music gear and ornaments. Intercut shots of vocalist Ichigo surrounded with construction tape appears during the songs verses, whilst Kyoudan is seen performing the guitar during instrumental breaks on a tank. The video ends with a long <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group standing in the warehouse.|$|E

5|$|After a one-minute {{break between}} periods, the third {{overtime}} began with another jump ball that was won by Chamberlain. After King missed the opening <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period, Carolina's Kearns made a right handed layup {{to bring the}} score to 50–48. Kansas failed to score again, and this time Kearns missed his shot after being fouled, but then made both free throws. Off of a pass from Loneski, Chamberlain made a shot, was fouled, and made the ensuing free throw to complete the three-point play and bring the Jayhawks within one point. Cunningham was fouled after being trapped in a double team and then missed the first <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> one-and-one. The Jayhawks' Loneski missed a contested, close layup, but King got the offensive rebound and was fouled on a put back shot. King made one of the free throws and tied the score at 5252.|$|E

25|$|An Air Force version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medal, the Queen's Medal for Champion <b>Shots</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Air Forces, {{was instituted}} in 1953. This was {{followed}} by <b>the</b> institution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Queen's Medal for Champion <b>Shots</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New Zealand Naval Forces in 1958 and the Queen's Medal for Champion <b>Shots</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Royal Navy and Royal Marines in 1966.|$|R
25|$|The Queen's Medal for Champion <b>Shots</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Royal Navy and Royal Marines {{was instituted}} in 1966. The medal is a Naval {{counterpart}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Queen's Medal for Champion Shots in the Military Forces and the Queen's Medal for Champion <b>Shots</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Air Forces and {{is identical to}} the Queen's Medal for Champion <b>Shots</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New Zealand Naval Forces that had been instituted in 1958.

5|$|Covered in {{the blood}} of his friends and sister, Ash stumbles outside as the sun begins to rise. Before he can get in his car to leave, a {{surviving}} entity attacks him from behind. The very last <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film is Ash letting out a final scream of terror before the film cuts abruptly to the ending credits.|$|E
5|$|For the CGI {{compositions}} of the Vale of Arryn, {{as seen in}} the establishing <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eyrie {{and from}} the sky cells, the visual effects team used images and textures from the Greek rock formations of Meteora. Initially they had been considering the Zhangjiajie Mountains in China, but because the landscape base plates were being shot in Ireland, using Meteora was a better option.|$|E
5|$|For the <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> levitating truck, {{which was}} used in the film to {{demonstrate}} the strange phenomena brought on by the coming of the alignment of the worlds, filmmakers attached a cement truck to a large hydraulic rig, which could be programmed to change speed and movement. In order to create Algrim's transformation into Kurse, Double Negative morphed live action performances of Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as both Algrim and Kurse. Double Negative then added in smoke and lava-like effects.|$|E
25|$|The medal's reverse {{design and}} the same ribbon was used in 1955 with the Queen's Medal for Champion <b>Shots</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New Zealand Naval Forces and in 1966 with the Queen's Medal for Champion <b>Shots</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Royal Navy and Royal Marines.|$|R

5|$|In {{the first}} three seasons, between Tony leaving the tunnel and passing through the toll plaza, the show had a <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> World Trade Center towers in Tony's {{rear-view}} mirror. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, this shot was removed and replaced with a more generic shot, beginning with the show's fourth season.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Swinton O. Scott III. In the opening <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> episode, the bus that the children travel in to the field trip had to vibrate up and down {{to give the impression}} that it did not have bumpers and that it was falling apart. Scott said it was difficult to animate the scene because of the vibrating and the backgrounds panning. Milhouse's tutor in the episode is based on the American actor Tony Randall.|$|E
5|$|The first Australian <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war {{took place}} several {{hours after the}} {{declaration}} of war when a gun at Fort Queenscliff fired across the bows of an Australian ship as it attempted to leave Melbourne without required clearances. On 10 October 1939 a Short Sunderland of No.10 Squadron, based in England for re-equipment, became the first Australian and the first Commonwealth air-force unit to go into action when it undertook a mission to Tunisia.|$|E

5|$|To {{capture the}} straight-on <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shower head, the camera {{had to be}} {{equipped}} with a long lens. The inner holes on the shower head were blocked and the camera placed a sufficient distance away so that the water, while appearing to be aimed directly at the lens, actually went around and past it.|$|E
5|$|Unrelated to {{the regular}} archive purges, the final <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Deadly Assassin Episode 3 (1976) has been excised from the master copy. The shot was removed after its initial UK transmission, {{following}} complaints from Mary Whitehouse of the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association. Subsequent repeats and commercial releases have restored the shot from off-air video copies.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Prine, {{who played}} Norman Ramsey, wrote the last {{fifth of the}} film because it had no ending. Both Ben Johnson and he were hung over while filming the train scene after partying the night before. During the rain scene with Ramsey, a snake made its way on the set. Crew members were yelling at Andrew {{that it was a}} moccasin, but Prine wanted to finish his scene without reshooting, so the crew killed the snake afterwards. The last <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film where the killer is seen {{standing}} in line at the movie theater was Pierce's wife's idea.|$|E

5|$|Forza Motorsport 4 was {{featured}} in the U.S. version of Top Gear. At the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards professional stunt driver and show co-host Tanner Foust and Rutledge Wood, car expert and co-host were featured in the unveiling of the game. Foust drove a 2010 Dodge Challenger while Wood rode as a passenger. The advertisement showed Foust drifting around the environment and ended with a top-down <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pad. On the pavement the word Forza was spelled out in tire marks. Additionally in the final episode of the show's second season Wood and co-host Adam Ferrara challenged Foust to a timed race at Infineon Raceway, otherwise known as Sears Point; Foust drove the Lexus LF-A around the real course while Wood and Ferrara drove the course in Forza Motorsport 4.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the use of}} visual effects, the closing sequence required ADR due to the sound of rain on the original filming. The visual effects were the director Dan Zeff's idea, and the writers were pleased that they were within budget. They also serve to tie the final shot to the opening <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> episode, as both feature a raven. Scenes that were cut down in the editing process included the initial meeting between the witchfinders—Warren and Clarke—and Sir Andrew Pike, and a private discussion between Warren and Clarke after {{the first day of the}} trial. The extended versions of the scenes featured an explanation about the Devil being found in everyday objects and a discussion about the stages of torture respectively. Shearsmith expressed frustration that these extra scenes could not be included on the DVD release.|$|E
5|$|In linking these shots together, Hepworth {{attempted}} {{to avoid the}} confusion of earlier multi-shot films such as Edwin S. Porter's The Great Train Robbery (1903). Three shots are used {{to set up the}} plot, that of the baby being stolen by a beggar woman. Nearly all of the following shots show Rover tracking down the child. When the dog returns home, the shots' settings are repeated in reverse as the dog travels them; they are shown again in the original order, for a third time, when the dog brings the father. A fourth repetition is, rather radically for its time, spared by showing the kidnapper's return to her room followed by a <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reunited family.|$|E
