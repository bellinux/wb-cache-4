40|$|Egg-oil (Charismon©) {{is known}} for its {{beneficial}} action in wound healing and other <b>skin</b> <b>irritancies</b> and its antibacterial activity. The physiological basis for these actions has been investigated using cells in culture: HaCaT-cells (immortalized human keratinocytes), human endothelial cells in culture (HUVEC), peripheral blood mononuclear lymphocytes (PBML) and a full thickness human skin model (FTSM). Emphasis was on the influence of egg-oil on cell migration and IL- 8 production in HaCaT cells, respiration, mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive oxygen (ROS) production and proliferation in HUVEC and HaCaT cells, cytokine and interleukin production in PBML and UV-light induced damage of FTSM. IL- 8 production by HaCaT cells is stimulated by egg-oil whilst in phythemagglutinin-activated PBMLs production of the interleukins IL- 2, IL- 6, IL- 10 and IFN-γ and TFN-α is reduced. ROS-production after H 2 O 2 stimulation first is enhanced but later on reduced. Respiration becomes activated due to partial uncoupling of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and proliferation of HaCaT and HUVEC is reduced. Recovery of human epidermis cells in FTSM after UV-irradiation is strongly supported by egg-oil. These results support the view that egg-oil acts through reduction of inflammatory processes and ROS production. Both these processes are equally important in cellular aging as in healing of chronic wounds...|$|R

The Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) considered Brilliant Blue FCF as safe for cats and dogs up to a maximum concentration of 278 and 334 mg/kg complete feed, respectively. Considering the large discrepancy between reported use and safe dietary levels of Brilliant Blue FCF, the FEEDAP Panel recommended the introduction of a maximum content of 300 mg/kg complete feed for cats and dogs. Brilliant Blue FCF should be regarded as an inhalation hazard. In the absence of data on <b>skin</b> and eye <b>irritancy,</b> it would be prudent to regard Brilliant Blue FCF as being potentially irritating to skin and/or eyes.

40|$|The transdermal {{application}} of drugs has attracted increasing interest {{over the last}} decade or so, due to the advantages it offers, compared to other delivery methods. The development of an efficient means of transdermal delivery can increase drug concentrations, while reducing their systemic distribution, thereby avoiding certain limitations of oral administration. The efficient barrier function of the skin, however, limits the use of most drugs as transdermal agents. This limitation has {{led to the development of}} various strategies to enhance drug-skin permeation, including the use of penetration enhancers. This method unfortunately has certain proven disadvantages, such as the increased absorption of unwanted components, besides the drug, which may induce <b>skin</b> damage and <b>irritancy.</b> The prodrug approach to increase the skin’s permeability to drugs represents a very promising alternative to penetration enhancers. The concept involves the chemical modification of a drug into a bioreversible entity that changes both its pharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic characteristics to enhance its delivery through the skin.

To be used, this technology needs economic but also environmental acceptance. Nevertheless, amines used in CO 2 capture process react with flue gas components (O 2, CO 2, NOx, SOx [...] .) to form degradation products, and some of them could be potentially dangerous to humans or environment according to their toxicity and their concentration. Ethanolamine (MEA) is the benchmark amine for this application. Although MEA degradation has been intensively studied, some degradation products are still unidentified. In this article, new degradation products of MEA are reported: pyrazine and 9 alkyl pyrazines. A new analytical method based on HS-SPME and GC-MS was developed to identify and quantify the 10 pyrazines present in a pilot plant sample. A mechanism for their formation was proposed. The toxicity of these molecules was assessed based on available toxicological data and, when the information was not sufficient, a computational approach was used: TOPKAT and DEREK SARs. LD 50, <b>skin</b> and eye <b>irritancy</b> potential, genotoxicity and reproductive effects were assessed.

To know whether in vitro tests for assessment of <b>skin</b> <b>irritancy</b> provide results approaching human conditions, comparisons {{have to be made}} between data deriving from in vitro tests and skin response in humans. The aim of our study was to assess the validity of the monolayer culture system of normal human keratinocytes {{as a model for the}} evaluation of the irritant effects of detergents, by comparing in vitro cell culture data to in vivo acute <b>skin</b> <b>irritancy</b> effects of cocamidopropyl betaine (CAPB), an amphoteric compound, Tween 20 (TW 20) (polysorbate 20) and Tween 80 (TW 80) (polysorbate 80), representing nonionic compounds, applied to the skin of 24 healthy volunteers at a concentration similar to that employed in commercial products. As parameters for cytotoxicity, cell proliferation, cell membrane integrity and cell metabolism were assessed by cell counts, thymidine incorporation, MTT conversion, and Neutral Red uptake. In order to increase the sensitivity of the in vivo evaluation, bioengineering methods for assessment of the effects of test products on the skin were employed. Whereas all 4 in vitro methods ranked the tensides according to their toxicity in the following order: CAPB>SLS>TW 20 >TW 80, both in vivo methods agreed in identifying SLS as the most irritating substance. Moreover, as compared with the irritation potential on human skin, all 4 in vitro tests overestimated the toxicity of CAPB.

For skin irritation, EpiSkin™, EpiDerm™ and SkinEthic™ are validated as stand-alone test replacements for the rabbit Draize test.

Since a slow and continuous permeation of ethanol for 8 h didn't damage the skin, the maximum flux is more important parameter for the effect of ethanol on the skin irritation than the cumulative amount of ethanol permeated.

Comparative studies showed that the viscosity of the formulations increases, spreadability decreases and vice versa. From the stability studies, creams showed no changes in properties after keeping at different temperatures for 90 days. All the formulations and the normal chloroform extracts of C. sparsiflorus Morong showed significant (P< 0. 001) wound healing activity by excision wound model and comparable with that of the reference standards and control bases. The measurement of the wound areas were taken on 3 rd, 6 th, 9 th, 12 th, 15 th and 18 th days and the percentages of wound closures were calculated...|$|E
40|$|The Flex-Het {{compound}} 10 a (SHetA 2 -NSC 721689) {[4 -nitrophenylamino][(2, 2, 4, 4 -tetramethylthiochroman- 6 -yl) amino]methane- 1 -thione]} {{has shown}} promise in preclinical testing as an anti-cancer agent without evidence of toxicity, <b>skin</b> <b>irritancy,</b> or teratogenicity. One {{objective of this}} study was to synthesize a series of heteroarotinoids structurally related to SHetA 2 and to measure the effect of structural alterations on the cytotoxicity activities of the compounds on A 2780 ovarian cancer cells. Alterations included comparisons of activity of an NO 2 end group versus a CO 2 Et end group, a thiourea linker versus a urea linker, and a distorted, thiochroman ring unit versus a planar quinoline ring unit. Cytotoxicity assays demonstrated the thiourea linker compounds to be similar in potency to the urea linker counterparts, the NO 2 substitutions were slightly more potent than the CO 2 Et substitutions, and replacement of the thiochroman group with a planar quinoline fused ring system markedly reduced activity. The mechanism of cytotoxicity through apoptosis was confirmed for the compounds. The optimal combination of structural features for enhancing potency consisted of a urea linker, a NO 2 substitution, and a flexible thiochroman unit. Extensive H-bonding in the more active urea derivative was confirmed by X-ray and NMR analyses. This is the first example in which the biological activity of flexible, thiochroman units is compared to that of fused aryl units in a heteroarotinoid molecule...|$|E
