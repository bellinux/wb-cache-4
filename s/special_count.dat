2500|$|The {{prelude to}} the crisis began when Bob Day of the Family First Party {{resigned}} from the Senate on 1 November 2016 following the collapse of his business. Shortly after Day's resignation, the government {{announced that it would}} move in the Senate to refer to the High Court the matter of the validity of Day's election in July 2016 in regard to a possible breach of section 44(v) of the Constitution, which provides that a person who [...] "has any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any agreement with the Public Service of the Commonwealth" [...] (and s 44 continues) [...] "shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting" [...] as a member of either house of the Parliamentand it follows that they are ineligible to be nominated for election to either house. The basis of the complaint was that, at Day's request, his Commonwealth-funded electorate office was by lease of part of a building in Adelaide that he indirectly owned, so that the Commonwealth's payments of rent would eventually come into a bank account of his own. In April 2017, the court found that Day was not validly elected at the 2016 election and ordered that a <b>special</b> <b>count</b> of South Australian ballot papers be held in order to determine his replacement. The court announced that Lucy Gichuhi was elected in his place. The Australian Labor Party lodged a challenge, claiming that Gichuhi might still be a citizen of Kenya, hence ineligible under Constitution section 44(i) as a citizen of a [...] "foreign power". [...] On 19 April 2017 a full court of the High Court found that the objection had not been made out and declared Gichuhi elected.|$|E

25|$|In {{the current}} cases, Chief Justice Kiefel has {{expressed}} some {{doubt as to}} whether <b>special</b> <b>counts</b> would be appropriate, given the time that has elapsed since the members concerned were elected back in July 2016. In addition, {{a number of the}} candidates most likely to succeed in any potential <b>special</b> <b>counts</b> might be disqualified by other parts of s 44. A possible alternative raised by some is to have special Senate elections in the four affected States.|$|R

5000|$|On 3 February 2017, the High Court {{determined}} the Senate reference, unanimously finding that Culleton had been ineligible for {{election to the}} Senate. At {{the time of the}} 2016 election he was subject to being sentenced to imprisonment for up to two years, which under Constitution section 44(ii) rendered him ineligible for election. This had not been affected by the subsequent annulment of the finding of guilt; the annulment had operated only {{from the time of the}} annulment. The vacancy should be filled by a <b>special</b> <b>count</b> of the ballot papers. Any directions necessary to give effect to the conduct of the <b>special</b> <b>count</b> should be made by a single Justice. However, the Court anticipated that a simple recount, as if Culleton had not been a candidate, would make the votes cast for him (so far as they were [...] "above the line", which was 96% of them) would flow through to the next One Nation candidate. The Court ordered, as the Commonwealth had previously agreed, that most (with specific exceptions) of Culleton's costs of the action would be borne by the Commonwealth (Culleton had initially represented himself, but eventually he had been provided with counsel).|$|E

50|$|Several {{of these}} columns were for special counts, {{and not to}} be {{included}} in the aggregate total. Doing so would have resulted in counting some individuals twice. Census takers were asked to use double lines, red ink or some other method of distinguishing these columns so that double counting would not occur. For example, the count of free white males between 16 and 18 was a <b>special</b> <b>count,</b> because these individuals were also supposed to be tabulated in the column for free white males of age 16 and under 26.|$|E
50|$|With {{cardinal}} {{numbers and}} related {{words such as}} няколко ('several'), masculine nouns use a <b>special</b> <b>count</b> form in -а/-я, which stems from the Proto-Slavonic dual: два/три стола ('two/three chairs') versus тези столове ('these chairs'); cf. feminine две/три/тези книги ('two/three/these books') and neuter две/три/тези легла ('two/three/these beds'). However, a recently developed language norm requires that count forms should only be used with masculine nouns that do not denote persons. Thus, двама/трима ученици ('two/three students') is perceived as more correct than двама/трима ученика, while the distinction is retained in cases such as два/три молива ('two/three pencils') versus тези моливи ('these pencils').|$|E
5000|$|Panagiotis [...] "Peter" [...] Georgiou (born 13 January 1974) is an Australian politician, {{currently}} {{serving as a}} Senator for Western Australia. He was the second candidate on the Senate ticket for Pauline Hanson's One Nation party in the 2016 Australian federal election. The lead candidate on the ticket was Rod Culleton, Georgiou's brother-in-law. Culleton was declared to have been elected to the Senate when the writs were returned, however the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns ruled on 3 February 2017 that Culleton had been ineligible to be elected {{at the time of}} the election. A consequence of this ruling was that the ballots underwent a <b>special</b> <b>count</b> discounting Culleton's position on the paper, and Georgiou was elected in his place. Georgiou was sworn in as a Senator on 27 March 2017.|$|E

30|$|Algorithm  2 {{has to be}} {{executed}} in anti-chronological order of the different snapshots, starting from the last one, since it uses the previously calculated results in the computation of the new results. This approach is amenable to concurrent computations. In fact, since the graph is divided into independent snapshots, the number of all journeys can be computed separately for each snapshot, {{and the result of}} the calculation can be aggregated at the end. This has the advantage of eliminating all the special updates from {{the first part of the}} algorithm (while detecting all the journey routes), and deferring them to the second part (when aggregating all the information for the final update). Thus, instead of performing the <b>special</b> <b>count</b> at each level, we can postpone it to the last step of the algorithm, and loop once through all the collected counts with hard-coded intervals in the loop.|$|E
30|$|More precisely, when {{a journey}} route (in {{this case a}} {{foremost}} journey route) from s to x (s x) is a prefix of a journey route x y {{at a later time}} snapshot, we perform a procedure called SpecialCount (Algorithm  3). The <b>special</b> <b>count</b> procedure involves aggregating the values of Count_s[v,x] with Count_x[v',y], for all nodes (resp. v, v') occurring in the journey routes between s and x and between x and y (see Algorithm  3). Algorithm  3 simply calculates the product of the number of foremost journeys between two routes s x, and x y, if they do not share any vertex (lines 4 – 9). If instead they share some vertex v, the calculation is slightly more complicated: let a be the number of foremost journeys from s to y where v is visited at least once on the route between x and y; let b be the number of foremost journeys from s to y where v is visited at least once on the route between s and x; and let c be the sum of a and b. c represents the number of all foremost journeys from s to y that pass through v. However, c counts the journey route passing through v multiple times if v happened to exist in both Count_s[v,x] and Count_x[v,y], and we need to remove such multiple counting of journeys, which is done along with the update to Count_s[v,y] in line 13.|$|E
