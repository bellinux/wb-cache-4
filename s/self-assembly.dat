Propofol, griseofulvin and prednisolone were loaded into amphiphilic PAAs. Particle size and morphology of drug-loaded <b>self-assemblies</b> were determined using photon correlation spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Solubilising capacity, in vitro drug release and formulation stability were analysed by HPLC, and in vitro biocompatibility studies (haemolysis and cytotoxicity) were carried out on bovine erythrocytes and Caco- 2 cells, respectively.

40|$|We {{present the}} first report {{on the effects of}} {{hydrostatic}} pressure on colloidally stabilized lipid nanoparticles enveloping inverse nonlamellar <b>self-assemblies</b> in their interiors. These internal <b>self-assemblies</b> were systematically tuned into bicontinuous cubic (Pn 3 m and Im 3 m), micellar cubic (Fd 3 m), hexagonal (H 2), and inverse micellar (L 2) phases by regulating the lipid/oil ratio as the hydrostatic pressure was varied from atmospheric pressure to 1200 bar and back to atmospheric pressure. The effects of pressure on these lipid nanoparticles were compared with those on their equilibrium bulk, nondispersed counterparts, namely, inverse nonlamellar liquid-crystalline phases and micellar solutions under excess-water conditions, using the synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) technique. In the applied pressure range, induced phase transitions were observed solely in fully hydrated bulk samples, whereas the internal <b>self-assemblies</b> of the corresponding lipid nanoparticles displayed only pressure-modulated single phases. Interestingly, both the lattice parameters and the linear pressure expansion coefficients were larger for the <b>self-assemblies</b> enveloped inside the lipid nanoparticles as compared to the bulk states. This behavior can, in part, be attributed to enhanced lipid layer undulations in the lipid particles in addition to induced swelling effects {{in the presence of the}} triblock copolymer F 127. The bicontinuous cubic phases both in the bulk state and inside lipid cubosome nanoparticles swell on compression, even as both keep swelling further upon decompression at relatively high pressures before shrinking again at ambient pressures. The pressure dependence of the phases is also modulated by the concentration of the solubilized oil (tetradecane). These studies demonstrate the tolerance of lipid nanoparticles [cubosomes, hexosomes, micellar cubosomes, and emulsified microemulsions (EMEs) ] for high pressures, confirming their robustness for various technological applications...|$|R
40|$|<b>Self-assemblies</b> {{and their}} {{hierarchies}} are useful to construct soft materials with structures at different length scales and to tune the materials properties for various functions.

Here we use the triblock copolypeptide poly(L-lysine) -b-poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) -b-poly(L-lysine) complexed with 2 '-deoxyguanosine 5 '-monophosphate. Supramolecular disks (G-quartets) stabilized by metal cations are formed and their columnar assembly leads to a packing frustration with the cylindrical packing of helical poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate), which we suggest is important in controlling the lateral dimensions of the nanofibers. We foresee routes for functionalities by selecting different metal cations within the G-quartets. On the other hand, we discuss nanofibers that are cleaved from bulk <b>self-assemblies</b> in a "top-down'' manner. After a short introduction based on cleaving nanofibers from diblock copolymeric <b>self-assemblies,</b> we focus on native cellulose nanofibers, as cleaved from plant cell wall fibers, which are expected to have feasible mechanical properties and to be templates for functional nanomaterials. Long nanofibers with 5 - 20 nm lateral dimensions can be cleaved within an aqueous medium to allow hydrogels and water can be removed to allow highly porous, lightweight, and flexible aerogels. We further describe inorganic/organic hybrids as prepared by chemical vapour deposition and atomic layer deposition of the different nanofibers. We foresee functional materials by selecting inorganic coatings. Finally we briefly discuss how the organic template can be removed e. g., by thermal treatments to allow completely inorganic hollow nanofibrillar structures...|$|R
25|$|<b>Self-assembly</b> of nanofibrous {{scaffolds}} is able {{to occur}} only when the fibers themselves are engineered for <b>self-assembly.</b> One common way to drive the <b>self-assembly</b> of scaffold fibers is to use amphiphilic peptides so that in water the hydrophobic moiety drives the <b>self-assembly.</b> Carefully calculated engineering of the amphiphilic peptides allows for precise control over the self-assembled matrix. <b>Self-assembly</b> {{is able to}} create both ordered and unordered topographies. Phillips et al. (2005) developed and tested in vitro and in vivo a self-aligned collagen-Schwann cell matrix, which allowed DRG neurite extension alignment in vitro. Collagen gels have been used extensively as substrates for three-dimensional tissue culture. Cells are able to form integrin-mediated attachments with collagen, which initiates cytoskeleton assembly and cell motility. As cells move along the collagen fibers they generate forces that contract the gel. When the collagen fibers are tethered at both ends, cell-generated forces create uniaxial strain, causing the cells and collagen fibers to align. The advantages of this matrix are its simplicity and speed of preparation. Soluble plasma fibronectin can also self-assemble into stable insoluble fibers when put under direct mechanical shearing within a viscous solution. Phillips et al. (2004) investigated a new method of shear aggregation that causes an improved aggregation. The mechanical shearing was created by dragging out a 0.2 ml bolus to 3cm with forceps; fibronectin aggregates into insoluble fibers at the rapidly moving interface in an ultrafiltration cell. The proposed mechanism for this fiber aggregation is protein extension and elongation under mechanical shear force, which leads to lateral packing and protein aggregation of fibers. Phillips et al. showed that mechanical shear produced by stretching a high viscosity fibronectin gel causes substantial changes in its structure and that when applied through uniaxial extension, a viscous fibronectin gel forms oriented fibrous fibronectin aggregates; additionally, the fibrous aggregates have a decreased solubility and can support the various cell types in vitro.|$|E

In recent years, attention has turned to the reversibility of these polymers’ thermal transitions, {{which has led to}} debate over what factors influence discrepancies in the transition temperature when heating the system compared to the temperature obtained when cooling the system, known as the thermal hysteresis. Herein, we synthesize micelles with tunable aggregation numbers (Nagg) whose cores contain poly(n-butyl acrylate-co-N,N-dimethylacrylamide) (p(nBA-co-DMA)) and four different thermoresponsive corona blocks, namely poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM), poly(N,N-diethylacrylamide) (pDEAm), poly(diethylene glycol monomethyl ether methacrylate) (pDEGMA) and poly(oligo(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether methacrylate) (pOEGMA). By studying their thermoresponsive behavior, we elucidate the effects of changing numerous important characteristics both in the thermoresponsive chain chemistry and architecture, and in the structure of their <b>self-assemblies.</b> Our findings demonstrate large deviations in the reversibility between the <b>self-assemblies</b> and the corresponding thermoresponsive homopolymers; specifically we find that micelles whose corona consist of polymers with a brush-like architecture (pDEGMA and pOEGMA) exhibit irreversible phase transitions at a critical chain density.

Combination of directionality of halogen bonding, mesogen parallel stacking and minimization of interfacial curvature translates into an overall alignment in bulk and films up to millimetre scale.

The {{formation of}} the <b>self-assemblies</b> {{was accompanied by a}} blue shift of the Q band of the dyes and by a quenching of the CdSe QDs luminescence. The largest spectral shift of the Q-band was approximately 7 nm and was observed for pentan- 3 -ylsulfanyl-functionalised phthalocyanine (3). Assuming a 1 : 1 stoichiometry, the calculated binding constant was 4 × 104 M− 1. Pc substituted with the bulky tert-butylsulfanyl groups (1) exhibited a smaller shift of the Q band. The quenching of the CdSe QDs luminescence by 1 was more effective than that observed for 3. The results indicated that the luminescence quenching may be due to a photoinduced charge transfer between 1 or 3 and the CdSe QDs. In contrast, the AzaPc (2) with the same substituents as 1 had little effect on the QDs luminescence.
