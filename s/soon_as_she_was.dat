Mumtaz Khan, a doctor, {{said that she had}} a 70% chance of survival. Interior Minister Rehman Malik said that Yousafzai would be moved to Germany, where she could receive the best medical treatment, as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> stable enough to travel. A team of doctors would travel with her, and the {{government}} would bear the expenditures of her treatment. Doctors reduced Yousafzai's sedation on 13 October, and she moved all four limbs.|$|E

Writing about this trip at length in In the Ice World of the Himalayas, Fanny made efforts to include scientific information and experiments, touting her own modified barometer as superior, but scholarly critics were unimpressed and pointed out her lack of scientific knowledge. Popular reviewers, on the other hand, enjoyed the book, with one concluding, [...] "We have no hesitation in saying that Dr. and Mrs. Workman have written {{one of the most remarkable}} books of travel of recent years." ...|$|E

At {{the end of that}} month, the crisis came to a head when she filed for divorce and the American press announced that marriage between her and the King was imminent. The King's private secretary, Alec Hardinge, wrote to him on 13 November, warning: [...] "The silence in the British Press on the subject of Your Majesty's friendship with Mrs Simpson {{is not going to be}} maintained... Judging by the letters from British subjects living in foreign countries where the Press has been outspoken, the effect will be calamitous." [...] Senior British ministers knew that Hardinge had written to the King and may have helped him draft the letter.|$|E
500|$|In November, Hańska {{suffered}} a miscarriage; {{she wrote to}} Balzac with the tragic news. He wanted to visit her, but Anna wrote asking him to remain in Paris. The emotion involved, she wrote, [...] "would be fatal". Hańska made {{plans to return to}} Wierzchownia, but Balzac begged her to visit him, which she did in the spring of 1847. As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> back in Ukraine, however, a new wrinkle unfolded. Hańska had long been unhappy with the presence of Balzac's housekeeper, Louise Breugniot, and he promised to break with her before marrying. He wrote with alarm to Hańska explaining that Breugninot had stolen her letters to him and blackmailed the author for 30,000 francs. Biographers disagree about truth of this story; Robb suggests it was [...] "a convincing hysterical performance put on for the benefit of his jealous fiancée".|$|E
500|$|The serial's {{official}} website described Carmella as [...] "the youngest daughter of local mafioso Rocco Cammeniti. She grew up spoilt and sheltered {{from the real}} world, which made her {{a force to be}} reckoned with as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> old enough to break free of her father's influence." [...] Carmella underwent many changes during her tenure. Blair initially described her as a [...] "fun, feisty and foxy sort of character". However, Carmella became depressed through her life's travails, having been stalked by Frank Romano, sold her cousin Teresa's baby and subsequently become a nun. Before her official confirmation in the convent, Carmella goes clubbing with ex-boyfriend Connor. Desrcibing Carmella's reasoning, Blair stated: [...] "Carmella is thinking, 'Is what I'm about to go ahead with, - becoming a nun - the right choice?' She wants to be sure she's making the right decision about what she'll do for the rest of her life." [...] Blair confirmed that after that night Carmella had [...] "all the answers that she needed" [...] to live the rest of her life. Blair enjoyed the opportunity to play a nun, but was glad when the storyline concluded as it meant Carmella got to have fun again.|$|E

Edgar was forced to fight unsupported for some time, as the next ship in line, , had run aground on the poorly charted Middle Ground, requiring , the next in line after Agamemnon, to manoeuvre around the stranded ship. During the course of the battle, Edgar had 31 killed, including the First Lieutenant and three soldiers of the 49th Regiment, and 115 men were wounded.|$|E
2500|$|In 1902, Mother Mary MacKillop (St Mary of the Cross), {{the founder}} of the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart, went to Rotorua during the last of her four visits to New Zealand. Her doctors had {{suggested}} that she might find in the mineral waters some relief from the rheumatic condition that was progressively limiting her activities and causing her considerable distress. In the course of her treatment, on 11 May 1902, she suffered a severe stroke and she seemed near death. As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> recovered sufficiently to be moved, Bishop Lenihan, the fifth Catholic Bishop of Auckland, arranged for her to be transported by rail to Auckland where she convalesced at the Remuera convent for the best part of a year.

2500|$|When {{the caller}} noted {{that she was}} {{referred}} to as the [...] "n-word" [...] by the individuals in question, Schlessinger complained that blacks are fine with cordially using the slur among themselves, but that it was wrong when whites used it to slur them. In doing so, she uttered [...] "nigger" [...] eleven times, albeit not directed at the caller. She discussed the word and its use by blacks and in black media. Her profuse use of the slur was mimicking the frequency of the word's use among black stand-up comics. When Hanson asked, [...] "Is it ever OK to say that word?" [...] Schlessinger responded, [...] "It depends how it’s said. Black guys talking to each other seem to think it’s OK." [...] After the call Schlessinger said, [...] "If you're that hypersensitive about color and don't have a sense of humor, don't marry out of your race." [...] Early that evening she wrote an apology to Los Angeles Radio People online journalist Don Barrett. A day later, as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> back on the air, Schlessinger apologized. Hanson questioned the motivation and sincerity of Schlessinger's apology, believing it to be result of being [...] "caught."

2500|$|Avenger and the escorts {{joined the}} homeward bound Convoy QP 14 at 05:00 17 September and sent up a Swordfish on anti-submarine patrol, which was {{maintained}} throughout the day. Ice {{on the flight}} deck prevented any flying on 18 September, and the convoy turned further north, away from the German airfields in Norway. A German reconnaissance plane did locate the convoy, but only kept it under observation and did not attack, so the Sea Hurricanes were kept on board Avenger. The Swordfish remained on patrol on 19 and 20 September without locating any U-boats. One merchant ship was torpedoed and sunk on 20 September. At 18:45 that evening, with three destroyers as escorts, Avenger left the convoy for Scapa Flow. Almost as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> out of sight, [...] was torpedoed, and two days later a merchant ship was torpedoed and sunk. After returning to port, Avengers captain Commander Colthust submitted a report highlighting how inadequate the Swordfish and Sea Hurricanes had been. In a single escort carrier the number of airframes and crews were never enough for {{what they had been}} asked to do. The Swordfish could not take off from the short flight deck of an escort carrier deck armed with torpedoes or enough depth charges and fuel to be useful, and the [...]303 calibre machine guns on the Sea Hurricane were ineffective against the armoured German reconnaissance aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|Lenthall {{initially}} expressed little {{personal interest}} {{in the design of}} ironclads, referring to them as [...] "humbug" [...] and writing in a letter to Captain Samuel Francis Du Pont in February 1861 that ironclads instead should be built by [...] "some of these young, smart, modern improvement, spirit of the age fellows." [...] He also expressed skepticism about the efficacy of John Ericssons revolutionary design of the monitor , expressing the view that Monitor would sink as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> launched. After the outbreak of the Civil War in April 1861, however, the United States Department of War sought Lenthalls help in designing shallow-draft warships for United States Army use in riverine warfare operations against Confederate forces. With his experience limited to deeper-draft seagoing ships, Lenthall doubted that a shallow-draft ship could house a successful steam propulsion plant, but he nonetheless drew up a preliminary design for a 170-foot (51.8-meter) warship with a beam of 28 feet (8.5 meters) and a draft of only 5 feet (1.5 meters) before passing it along to Samuel M. Pook and James Buchanan Eads so that he could devote his own time to ocean-going ships. Pook and Eads in turn modified Lenthalls design to produce the first American ironclad warships, the seven City-class ironclad gunboats that served on rivers in what is now the central United States as the core of the U.S. Armys Western Gunboat Flotilla, later transferred to the U.S. Navy as the Mississippi River Squadron.|$|E
2500|$|Basically, [...] "O Armatolos" [...] {{tells the}} story about the death of a legendary hero who {{protected}} the villagers from the gangs of Gheg Albanians (Ghegis). The action in the poem takes place {{in the middle of the}} 19th century in the western regions of Macedonia, respectively the region between Galichnik, Reka, and the village Stan (all in present-day Republic of Macedonia). Based on the motif of the folk songs about Kuzman Kapidan, the theme of the poem develops into nine parts. The first part, based on nine quatrains, tells about the statements of the tragic struggle and death of the hero Cosmas. In the second part, Cosmas' mother distressed expects her son's return from battle, not knowing that he died. The third part is the most striking piece in the poem, telling the cry that the enemies of the peasants caused by bringing the inanimate body of Cosmas into the village. It is in this part that the poem's most popular line [...] "screams can be heard from Galichnik in Reka" [...] is used, as an allusion to the sorrow of the people. In the fourth part, the author returns to the scenes of Cosmas' last battle and his demise. Through the fifth part, the attackers pay due respect to Cosmas by pledging not to attack his home village. Cosmas' mother removes the curse she had said towards the village enemies and forgives them, requiring the Gheg Albanians not to attack the Reka people any more. In the sixth part is seen the grieving of Cosmas' mother and through it is told the genealogical tree of the hero. This section notes Cosmas' lover Cveta, that washes the hero with her tears. The seventh part tells how the hero's mother orders the villagers to bury Cosmas and the other fighters together with all honors. The scene of the eight part takes place at the home of Cosmas' fiancee. Folk customs would refrain her from wailing over the death of Cosmas before her father. But as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> left alone, her bitter cry echoed, forcing her to give up all thing earthly and become a nun. The ninth part marks the end of the piece, in which is marked the everlasting glory of Cosmas in the village.|$|E
