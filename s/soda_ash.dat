5|$|During the Industrial Revolution in Europe, {{demand for}} {{alkaline}} substances increased. A new industrial process developed by Nicolas Leblanc of Issoundun, France enabled cheap large-scale production of sodium carbonate (<b>soda</b> <b>ash).</b> In this Leblanc process, common salt {{is converted to}} <b>soda</b> <b>ash,</b> using sulfuric acid, limestone, and coal, releasing hydrogen chloride as a by-product. Until the British Alkali Act 1863 and similar legislation in other countries, the excess HCl was vented into the air. After {{the passage of the}} act, <b>soda</b> <b>ash</b> producers were obliged to absorb the waste gas in water, producing hydrochloric acid on an industrial scale.|$|E
5|$|Since medieval times, dubbin, a waxy product, {{was used}} to soften and {{waterproof}} leather; however, it did not impart shine. It was made from natural wax, oil, <b>soda</b> <b>ash</b> and tallow. As leather with a high natural veneer became popular in the 18th century, a high glossy finish became important, particularly on shoes and boots. In most cases, a variety of homemade polishes were used to provide this finish, often with lanolin or beeswax as a base.|$|E

40|$|The site of Nogara (province of Verona, Italy) {{provides}} {{valuable insights}} into {{the complexities of the}} glass industry in mid-Medieval times, due to its timing, which ranges mainly between the 10 th and 11 th centuries AD, and to the great quantity of glass findings, mainly tableware. In the present paper, the combination of archaeological, chemical and textural data allows us to identify production technologies in a time-interval perceived to be a period of technological transition for glass. In particular, the frequent occurrence of recycled natron glass and only a few glass samples made with <b>soda</b> plant <b>ash</b> indicate that recycling of earlier glass was common in inland Northern Italy in the 10 the 11 th centuries AD. In addition, blue and reticello decorations were obtained by recycling earlier glass mosaic tesserae, as shown by much Co, Cu, Sn, Sb and Pb and the presence of crystallised calcium antimonates. A few glass samples with chemical compositions intermediate between natron and <b>soda</b> plant <b>ash</b> glass were also identified, suggesting a gradual change in glass composition from natron-based towards soda ash-based production technology, which prevailed in the 13 th- 14 th centuries. In conclusion, the difficulty in describing mid- Medieval glass as a well-defined entity, due to the great propensity for recycling earlier glass samples which causes variability in chemical compositions, particularly those of trace elements, is clearly documented here. In any case, this paper contributes to a new type of chrono-typological scanning and to more detailed knowledge of glass production technology during mid-Medieval times in Northern Italy, little found in the literature until now...|$|R

5|$|Himalayan salt is Pakistan's {{best known}} rock salt. It {{is used for}} cooking, as bath salt, as brine and as a raw {{material}} for many industries, including a <b>soda</b> <b>ash</b> plant set up by AkzoNobel in 1940. Salt from Khewra mine {{is also used to}} make decorative items like lamps, vases, ashtrays and statues, which are exported to the United States, India and many European countries. The use of rock salt to make artistic and decorative items started during the Mughal era, when many craftsman made tableware and decorations from it. Warth introduced the use of a lathe to cut out art pieces from the rock salt, as he found it similar to gypsum in physical characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Production {{methods for}} the {{elements}} less frequently recognised as metalloids involve natural processing, electrolytic or chemical reduction, or irradiation. Carbon (as graphite) occurs naturally and is extracted by crushing the parent rock and floating the lighter graphite to the surface. Aluminium is extracted by dissolving its oxide Al2O3 in molten cryolite Na3AlF6 {{and then by}} high temperature electrolytic reduction. Selenium is produced by roasting the coinage metal selenides X2Se (X = Cu, Ag, Au) with <b>soda</b> <b>ash</b> to give the selenite: X2Se + O2 + Na2CO3 → Na2SeO3 + 2 X + CO2; the selenide is neutralized by sulfuric acid H2SO4 to give selenous acid H2SeO3; this is reduced by bubbling with SO2 to yield elemental selenium. Polonium and astatine are produced in minute quantities by irradiating bismuth.|$|E
5|$|This {{reaction}} is exothermic and releases enough heat to ignite the resulting hydrogen {{in the presence}} of oxygen, possibly explosively splashing onlookers with potassium hydroxide, which is a strong alkali that destroys living tissue and causes skin burns. Finely grated potassium ignites in air at room temperature. The bulk metal ignites in air if heated. Because its density is 0.89 g/cm3, burning potassium floats in water that exposes it to atmospheric oxygen. Many common fire extinguishing agents, including water, either are ineffective or make a potassium fire worse. Nitrogen, argon, sodium chloride (table salt), sodium carbonate (<b>soda</b> <b>ash),</b> and silicon dioxide (sand) are effective if they are dry. Some Class D dry powder extinguishers designed for metal fires are also effective. These agents deprive the fire of oxygen and cool the potassium metal.|$|E
40|$|In this study, the strontium, {{neodymium}} {{and oxygen}} isotopic composition of Roman (1 st- 3 rd century AD) and late-Roman glass (4 th- 6 th century AD) from Adria and Aquileia, {{two of the}} most important archaeological sites of north-eastern Italy, is discussed. The majority of glass analysed, independent from age, shows values of strontium isotope ratios close to that of modern seawater, indicating that the source of lime in the glass was marine shell, and likely coastal sands were used in its production. The Nd signature of all late-Roman glasses from Aquileia and {{of the majority of the}} Roman ones from Adria, independent from their chemical composition, is homogeneous and higher than- 6 εNd, supporting the hypothesis of an eastern Mediterranean origin, probably located on Syro-Palestinian coast. However, the composition of late-Roman samples with HIMT signature, with lower 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values correlated to higher contents in Fe 2 O 3, TiO 2, MgO and lower contents in CaO, suggests an area of origin for this glass on the Egyptian coast. In addition, the different Nd signatures of two Adria Roman glasses (εNd<- 7) suggest their primary production in western Mediterranean. Oxygen isotopes proved to be a further diagnostic method to discriminate natron and <b>soda</b> plant <b>ash</b> glass, and different silica sources, in the case of the <b>soda</b> plant <b>ash</b> glass. The combination of isotopic and chemical data supports the hypothesis of an eastern Mediterranean origin for late-Roman glass, which may be produced in few primary workshops on the Syro-Palestinian and Egyptian coast, although not necessarily in the same ateliers as have been identified so far. In the case of the Roman glass investigated, although the majority of data suggests an eastern Mediterranean origin, on the basis of Nd isotopes and chemical compositions, the existence of other primary glass producers located in the western Mediterranean can be suggested...|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} years of European {{settlement}} of the Americas, settlers and some groups of Indigenous peoples of the Americas used <b>soda</b> or pearl <b>ash,</b> more commonly known as potash (pot ash) or potassium carbonate, as a leavening agent (the forerunner to baking soda) in quick breads. In the US, soda breads were first publicised by Amelia Simmons as a quick and cheap method of bread making in her book American Cookery, published in 1796.

40|$|A {{sample of}} 29 glasses {{uncovered}} from Tell Es-Sukhnah, Jordan, {{has been subjected}} for XRF analysis. The group of sample consisted of two main categories: samples from glass vessels and glass bracelets. The main aim of this analysis is to identify and authenticate the raw materials used in glass production, manufacture technology and the technical choices related to glass objects from the Roman to Byzantine and Islamic occupations at the site. Chronologically speaking, the chemical analysis of the samples enables the distinguishing between Roman soda natron glass and Islamic <b>soda</b> plant <b>ash</b> glass at this freshly excavated site. The most important observation was that the transition {{in the use of}} traditional methods and of the same sources of raw materials for glass-making occurred, with obvious modifications, from natron to plant ash and from calcium-rich sand to calcium -free sand through the period from 1 st to 10 th century AD at this southern Levantine site...|$|R
5|$|However, as {{transshipment}} costs increased, and unprocessed bulk cargos {{decreased in}} volume, {{the economics of}} road transport resulted in a gradual dwindling of traffic on the MSC Railway system, and hence contraction in the MSC Railway itself.

25|$|In the 18th century, Glauber's salt {{began to}} be used as a raw {{material}} for the industrial production of <b>soda</b> <b>ash</b> (sodium carbonate), by reaction with potash (potassium carbonate).

30|$|The differing lead {{contents}} within {{both groups}} analysed {{in this investigation}} also correspond to reports about glass makers {{from the end of}} the seventeenth century experimenting with the lead content of their glass melts in order to stabilize the resulting glass objects, but also to increase the brilliance, refractive index and density of the glass [14 – 16]. Similar considerations may be true for the mixed alkali content of the flakes I/ 3, I/ 39, I/ 60 and I/ 62. Some compositions indicate the use of <b>soda</b> rich plant <b>ash</b> or potash with borax. Also the use of the ingredients mentioned in the recipes of Ravenscroft (tartar, nitre, borax) cannot be excluded here.|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{emphasizes}} the importance of measuring the oxygen isotopic and chemical compositions of ancient glass, in order to constrain some features such as age, raw materials, and production technologies and to identify the “fingerprint” of local productions. In this context, thirty-nine Roman and late Antique glass samples and eight chert samples from northern Greece were selected and analysed for their oxygen isotopic and chemical compositions. Results show that the majority of glass samples are produced using natron as flux and have δ 18 O values of about 15. 5 ‰, plus or minus a few tenths of one per mil, suggesting that raw materials probably come from Levantine area. Four samples are heavily enriched in 18 O, and their chemical composition clearly shows that they were made with <b>soda</b> plant <b>ash</b> as flux. Isotopic and chemical data of Greek chert samples support the hypothesis of local production of the above samples. About half of the glass samples have chemical compositions, which allow their age to be constrained to the late Antique period. For the remaining glass, similarities with literature compositional groups are reported and discussed...|$|R

40|$|Methods of {{reducing}} the concentration of contaminants in mine water and in the acidic raffinate from uranium milling operations have been studied. Lime, limestone, caustic <b>soda</b> and lime-soda <b>ash</b> mixtures were compared as reagents for neutralising raffinates and for removing amines and heavy metals including radium from solution. All methods of neutralisation reduced contaminant levels significantly. Two-stage neutralisation using limestone {{in the first stage}} to pH 4, followed by second stage lime treatment appears to be an economically attractive approach. This method usually gave the lowest residual radium concentration provided the solids from the first stage were not removed before adding lime. Radium can be further removed from neutralised raffinates or from mine water conditioned with sulphate by the addition of barium chloride to co-precipitate the sulphates of barium and radium. The concentration of radium was readily reduced to less than 3 pCi £- 1 by adding 10 mg Ba £- 1 raffinate. For mine waters conditioned to 0. 01 M in sulphate, barium additions of 20 mg £-l were required to attain the same radium concentrations.

The aim was to come-up with a sustainable new way of managing the menace of sawdust, an urban solid waste, that is becoming cumbersome to manage. Caustic soda, (NaOH); Urea, ([NH 2] 2 CO) and Wood ash were used to treat the sawdust and thereafter supplemented with molasses. The results indicated a significant effect (P< 0. 05) of rations on Average Daily Gains, Feed Conversion Ratio and on Feed cost per Kg gain. Feed costs per Kg gain were better for the Urea and Caustic soda treated sawdust rations compared to the control. There was, however, no significant effect on Final weight and on Feed intake. It was, therefore, established that the digestibility coefficients of the treated sawdust were high enough to cause increase in live-weight of the test animals and that the poor nutritional values preventing the use of sawdust as animal feed in poor nations can be enhanced by treating it with Urea, Caustic <b>soda</b> and/or Wood <b>ash...</b>|$|R

40|$|The present paper reports {{results from}} a {{systematic}} study of oxygen isotopic compositions for glass samples from various archaeological sites (i. e., Iulia Felix, Grado, Vicenza, Pozzuoli and Modena in Italy, and Derrière Sairoche in Switzerland) and dated from the Roman period to the 18 th century AD, {{as well as of}} some raw materials that may have been used for their production. The analysed samples differ essentially in the type of flux, using Roman and high Medieval glass natron and late Medieval and modern glass plant <b>ash,</b> <b>soda</b> and potash respectively. The aim {{of this study was to}} amplify the database of oxygen isotope data for various archaeological glasses and to identify isotopic trends indicating different raw materials, production technology, and/or provenance. Results indicate that natron glass samples of various provenance and age have consistently higher δ 18 O values than plant ash ones (about 15. 5 ‰ vs 13. 0 ‰), probably due to the different flux, highly 18 O-enriched in the case of natron. Isotopic data on Belus and Campanian sands, the types mentioned by Pliny for glass production, show that they have similar isotopic composition. Taking into account the oxygen isotopic composition of Roman glass, the “positive natron effect”, and the negligible influence of small amounts of manganese and antimony containing decolourisers, the suitability of both sources for glass production is verified, supporting the hypothesis of multiple sand sources. Notwithstanding this, the isotopic similarity between Belus and Campanian sands prevents us from identifying the starting material from the δ 18 O of the final product. In the case of plant ash used as flux, it is not possible to distinguish between soda and potash plant ash, because the addition of ash did not contribute isotopically heavy oxygen and the silica source is presumed to be comparable in the analysed samples. The isotopic data of the present study are also compared with those already published in the literature, and possible interpretations on their analogies and differences are discussed...|$|R
