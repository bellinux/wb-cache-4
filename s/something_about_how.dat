500|$|Originally, Lundgren {{planned on}} playing a {{supporting}} role, {{with a more}} famous actor in the lead. He also considered directing the film, but decided against it, as he desired {{to learn more about}} producing. In 2013, Lundgren announced the casting of Tony Jaa, in the role of Tony Vitayakul; and Ekachai Uekrongtham as the director. Lundgren chose Uekrongtham after being impressed with his film, Beautiful Boxer. He contacted him through a mutual friend in Los Angeles, and in mid-2013, they arranged to meet in the city. While he had previously turned down scripts offered to him for international markets, Uekrongtham found Skin Trade [...] "riveting". He said the script [...] " [...] the potential to work as a character-driven piece while saying <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> we deal with scars, literal and otherwise". Jaa, on the other hand, met with Lundgren through his manager and film agent. He couldn't speak any English when cast, but claimed to have taken [...] "intensive" [...] lessons in preparation for his role; stating he is now [...] "reasonably fluent" [...] in [...] "conversational" [...] English.|$|E

He said: [...] "You {{can say that}} about all politicians, but there's <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> he uses his story about being the son of Indian immigrants {{and then at the}} same time talks about how we're all Americans and should get rid of hyphenated identities [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|Proponents of {{this new}} phase in {{archaeology}} claimed that with the rigorous use of the scientific method {{it was possible to}} get past the limits of the archaeological record and learn <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> the people who used the artifacts lived. Colin Renfrew, a proponent of the new processual archaeology, observed in 1987 that it focuses attention on [...] "the underlying historical processes which are at the root of change". Archaeology, he noted [...] "has learnt to speak with greater authority and accuracy about the ecology of past societies, their technology, their economic basis and their social organization. Now it is beginning to interest itself in the ideology of early communities: their religions, the way they expressed rank, status and group identity." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s and early 1990s, {{advances}} in cognitive psychology and cognitive linguistics {{renewed interest in}} the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis. One of those who adopted a more Whorfian approach was George Lakoff. He argued that language is often used metaphorically and that languages use different cultural metaphors that reveal <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> speakers of that language think. For example, English employs conceptual metaphors likening time with money, so that time can be saved and spent and invested, whereas other languages do not talk about time in that way. Other such metaphors are common to many languages because {{they are based on}} general human experience, for example, metaphors likening up with good and bad with down. Lakoff also argued that metaphor plays an important part in political debates such as the [...] "right to life" [...] or the [...] "right to choose"; or [...] "illegal aliens" [...] or [...] "undocumented workers".|$|E
2500|$|Asked how she {{can write}} so believably about a man's inner life, Flynn says, [...] "I'm kind of part guy myself." [...] When {{she needs to}} {{understand}} <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> men think, she asks her husband or a male friend. [...] Flynn's autobiographical essay [...] "I Was Not a Nice Little Girl..." [...] invites readers to believe she took inspiration for Amy Dunne from her own interior monologue. In that essay, Flynn confesses to sadistic childhood impulses like [...] "stunning ants and feeding them to spiders." [...] A favourite indoor game called [...] "Mean Aunt Rosie" [...] allowed Flynn to cast herself as a [...] "witchy caregiver" [...] who exercised malevolent influence over her cousins. The same essay argues that women fail to acknowledge their own violent impulses and incorporate them into their personal narratives, though men tend to cherish stories of their childhood meanness.|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, {{professor}} and New York Times writer Jay Dolan critiqued Generations for not talking more about class, race and sex, to which Neil Howe replied that they [...] "are probably generalizations not even {{as effective as}} a generation to say <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> people think and behave. One of the things {{to understand is that}} most historians never look at history in terms of generations. They prefer to tell history as a seamless row of 55-year-old leaders who always tend to think and behave the same way -- but they don't and they never have. If you look at the way America's 55-year-old leaders were acting in the 1960s -- you know, the ebullient and confidence of the JFKs and LBJs and Hubert Humphreys -- and compare them with today's leaders in Congress -- the indecision, the lack of sure-footedness -- I think you would have to agree that 55-year-olds do not always act the same way and you're dealing with powerful generational forces at work that explain why one generation of war veterans, war heroes, and another generation which came of age in very different circumstances tend to have very different instincts about acting in the world.” ...|$|E

Although the genetic underpinnings of observable phenotypes are extremely difficult to show, behavioural characteristics can be selectively bred.

5000|$|In {{his essay}} [...] "A Nice Derangement of Epitaphs", philosopher Donald Davidson {{suggests}} that malapropisms reveal <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> people process {{the meanings of}} words. He argues that language competence must not simply involve learning a set meaning for each word, and then rigidly applying those semantic rules to decode other people's utterances. Rather, he says, people must also be continually making use of other contextual information to interpret the meaning of utterances, and then modifying their understanding of each word's meaning based on those interpretations.|$|E
50|$|Whilst {{there may}} be some skills that are more or less generic in the {{management}} of large organisations - presumably the kinds of skills that are taught on MBA schemes around the world - we can also ask if managers do better if they understand particularities of the business they are in charge of. Intuitively it seems reasonable to suggest that the manager of a newspaper should know <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> a journalist works or that a manager of a car factory should know <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> a Production-line works. Whilst this kind of thinking is formally included in many training schemes, the idea of interactional expertise allows us to ask about the kind of experience that is needed in order for managers who lack the embodied experience of writing copy or working on a production line to understand what this is like for those that do fulfil these roles. One implication of interactional expertise is that direct experience - working one’s way up through the ranks - may be less important than previously thought even though lots of interaction with those who do these tasks could still be important. Certainly in the management of large science projects, managers will work hard to acquire interactional expertise quickly.|$|E
50|$|To say {{something}} has a {{function is to}} say <b>something</b> <b>about</b> what it does for the organism. It also says <b>something</b> <b>about</b> its history: <b>how</b> it has come about. A heart pumps blood: that is its function. It also emits sound, which {{is considered to be}} an ancillary side-effect, not its function. The heart has a history (which may be well or poorly understood), and that history is <b>about</b> <b>how</b> natural selection formed and maintained the heart as a pump. Every aspect of an organism that has a function has a history. Now, an adaptation must have a functional history: therefore we expect it must have undergone selection caused by relative survival in its habitat. It would be quite wrong to use the word adaptation about a trait which arose as a by-product.|$|R
