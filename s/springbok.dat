5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{apartheid}}, when apartheid legislation {{had been}} repealed, <b>Springbok</b> colours started to be issued to non-whites again. In 1994, following the election of Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress, the National Colours Board {{was set up to}} control the distribution of <b>Springbok</b> colours. Despite this, the majority of South Africa's sporting organisations stopped awarding <b>Springbok</b> colours following the replacement of the <b>Springbok</b> by the Protea following a government demand. The only sporting body in South Africa that was allowed to retain <b>Springbok</b> colours was the South African Rugby Union as an act of conciliation towards the white minority who made up the majority of the national rugby union team.|$|E
5|$|<b>Springbok</b> are {{primarily}} browsers and may switch to grazing occasionally; they feed on shrubs and young succulents (such as Lampranthus species) before they lignify. They prefer grasses such as Themeda triandra. <b>Springbok</b> can meet their water needs {{from the food}} they eat, {{and are able to}} survive without drinking water through dry season. In extreme cases, they do not drink any water over the course of their lives. <b>Springbok</b> may accomplish this by selecting flowers, seeds, and leaves of shrubs before dawn, when the food items are most succulent. In places such as the Etosha National Park, <b>springbok</b> seek out water bodies where they are available. <b>Springbok</b> gather in the wet season and disperse during the dry season, unlike other African mammals.|$|E
5|$|<b>Springbok</b> colours {{are only}} awarded to South Africans. Australian Eddie Jones, {{who worked as}} a {{technical}} advisor to South Africa for the 2007 Rugby World Cup, was not allowed to be issued with <b>Springbok</b> colours as a non-South African and was obliged to wear a South Africa tracksuit when pitchside. Following South Africa's victory in the Rugby World Cup, all players and coaching team members were expected to wear their <b>Springbok</b> colours to the post-tournament awards dinner. In protest at Jones not being issued with colours, Bryan Habana gave Jones his <b>Springbok</b> colours and the team attended the awards dinner in suits instead of in <b>Springbok</b> colours.|$|E

5|$|<b>Springbok</b> {{inhabit the}} dry areas of south and southwestern Africa. The International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources classifies the <b>springbok</b> as a least concern species. No major {{threats to the}} {{long-term}} survival of the species are known; the <b>springbok,</b> in fact, {{is one of the}} few antelope species considered to have an expanding population. They are popular game animals, and are valued for their meat and skin. The <b>springbok</b> is the national animal of South Africa.|$|E
5|$|<b>Springbok</b> was sired by the {{imported}} horse Australian {{and out of}} the mare Hester. Hester was by Lexington and out of a mare named Heads I Say by imported stallion Glencoe. <b>Springbok</b> was foaled in 1870, and was a chestnut stallion, bred by A. J. Alexander of Woodburn, Kentucky. <b>Springbok</b> was one of 26 stakes winning foals sired by Australian. <b>Springbok</b> was Hester's only stakes winning foal.|$|E
5|$|The highest award {{attainable}} by a Scout in South Africa is the <b>Springbok</b> award. A Scout {{is required}} to complete all the requirements for the <b>Springbok</b> award before their 18th birthday.|$|E
50|$|Janse van Rensburg first {{represented}} <b>Springboks</b> XV in a non-cap friendly vs Barbarians XV {{in which}} he scored a last-gasp try to secure a 31-31 draw. He was later included in the <b>Springboks</b> squad for their 2016 Outgoing series of Europe. He started {{the final game of}} the tour vs Wales at inside centre where the <b>Springboks</b> lost.|$|R
50|$|As of 7 August 2005, he {{has amassed}} 54 {{appearances}} for the <b>Springboks,</b> placing {{him in the}} top seven all-time for <b>Springboks</b> caps, and scored 22 tries. Perhaps his most notable <b>Springboks</b> match was a two-try performance against Australia in the 2002 Tri Nations. In the Currie Cup, playing mainly for Western Province, he has averaged nearly a try a match.|$|R
50|$|He {{played his}} first {{test for the}} <b>Springboks</b> on 26 June 1993 against France (drew 20-20). He won his last cap for the <b>Springboks</b> on 15 December 1996 against Wales (won 37-20).|$|R
5|$|The {{historic}} {{range of}} the <b>springbok</b> stretched across the dry grasslands, bushlands, and shrublands of south-western and southern Africa; <b>springbok</b> migrated sporadically in southern parts of the range. These migrations are rarely seen nowadays, but seasonal congregations can still be observed in preferred areas of short vegetation, such as the Kalahari desert.|$|E

5|$|The <b>springbok</b> {{has been}} {{classified}} as least concern by the IUCN. No major {{threats to the}} long-term survival of the species are known. In fact, the <b>springbok</b> {{is one of the}} few antelope species with a positive population trend.|$|E
50|$|Lancaster {{replaced}} Morgan with Dowson, and England's {{reply was}} almost immediate. The <b>Springboks</b> misjudged the kick-off, which allowed Foden to intercept {{the ball and}} race towards the tryline. Again, the <b>Springboks</b> managed to scramble and again, Habana hurt himself, this time colliding with Frans Steyn. Referee Walsh penalised the <b>Springboks</b> for offside and Farrell slotted the penalty to take the score to 16 - 9.|$|R
5000|$|While {{attending}} a {{game between the}} <b>Springboks,</b> the country's rugby union team, and England, Mandela recognises that the black people in the stadium are cheering for England, as the mostly-white <b>Springboks</b> represent prejudice and apartheid in their minds; he remarks that {{he did the same}} while imprisoned on Robben Island. Knowing that South Africa is set to host the 1995 Rugby World Cup in one year's time, Mandela persuades a meeting of the newly black-dominated South African Sports Committee to support the <b>Springboks.</b> He then meets with the captain of the <b>Springboks</b> rugby team, François Pienaar (Matt Damon), and implies that a <b>Springboks</b> victory in the World Cup will unite and inspire the nation. Mandela also shares with François a British poem, [...] "Invictus", that had inspired him during his time in prison.|$|R
50|$|Sephaka {{made his}} {{international}} debut for the <b>Springboks</b> on 1 December 2001 in a match against the United States at Robertson Stadium in Houston. The <b>Springboks</b> {{won the game}} 43 points to 20.|$|R
5|$|A {{study of}} {{vigilance}} behaviour of herds revealed that individuals on {{the borders of}} herds {{tend to be more}} cautious; vigilance decreases with group size. Group size and distance from roads and bushes were found to have major influence on vigilance, more among the grazing <b>springbok</b> than among their browsing counterparts. Adults were found to be more vigilant than juveniles, and males more vigilant than females. <b>Springbok</b> passing through bushes tend to be more vulnerable to predator attacks as they can not be easily alerted, and predators usually conceal themselves in bushes. Another study calculated that the time spent in vigilance by <b>springbok</b> on the edges of herds is roughly double that spent by those in the centre and the open. <b>Springbok</b> were found to be more cautious in the late morning than at dawn or in the afternoon, and more at night than in the daytime. Rates and methods of vigilance were found to vary with the aim of lowering risk from predators.|$|E
5|$|In earlier times, when large {{populations of}} <b>springbok</b> roamed the Kalahari desert and Karoo, {{millions}} of migrating <b>springbok</b> formed herds hundreds of kilometres long {{that could take}} several days to pass a town. These mass treks, known as trekbokken in Afrikaans, took place during long periods of drought. Herds could efficiently retrace their paths to their territories after long migrations. Trekbokken is still observed occasionally in Botswana, though on a much smaller scale than earlier.|$|E
5|$|<b>Springbok</b> (1870–1897) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who won {{the seventh}} Belmont Stakes in 1873. Foaled in 1870, he was sired by the {{imported}} stallion Australian, his dam was a daughter of Lexington. During his racing career he started 25 races, winning 17 of them. Besides the Belmont, <b>Springbok</b> won the Saratoga Cup twice, in 1874 and 1875 and was named Champion Older Male horse in 1874 and 1875. After retiring from the racetrack, he sired five stakes winners and died in 1897.|$|E
50|$|After playing only 6 test matches for the <b>Springboks,</b> Teichmann was {{appointed}} as {{captain of the}} squad in 1996, {{and went on to}} become one of South Africa's most successful captains ever. He captained the <b>Springboks</b> in 39 tests between 1996 and 1999 with 27 of those (72%) ending in victory. The <b>Springboks,</b> with Teichmann at the helm, were considered by many the greatest South African team in history.|$|R
50|$|Tyibilika next {{played for}} the <b>Springboks</b> the {{following}} season in June, where he played against Uruguay, which the <b>Springboks</b> won 134-3. He then played a subsequent test against the Wallabies in the 2005 Tri Nations Series, which the <b>Springboks</b> won 33-20 at Ellis Park in Johannesburg. He earned one other cap that year against Argentina in Buenos Aires in November. He was named in the Springboks' 2006 Tri Nations Series squad.|$|R
25|$|In 1976 {{he led the}} <b>Springboks</b> in a tough four-test {{series against}} the All Blacks. The <b>Springboks</b> won the first test 16–7, but lost the second 15–9. But Du Plessis and his men bounced back in the third test, winning 15–10. The <b>Springboks</b> took the victory in a 15–14 win over the New Zealanders in the fourth and final test. The {{following}} year he led the <b>Springboks</b> to victory, 45–24, over a World XV side in Pretoria. Although anti-apartheid boycotts were increasingly isolating South African sports teams, the <b>Springboks</b> played two matches against the South American Jaguars in 1980, made up mainly of Argentinian players. South Africa won 24–9 in Johannesburg and 18–9 in Durban. Du Plessis captained the <b>Springboks</b> to a 3–1 victory in 1980's home test series against the British Lions and led the team on the 1980 South Africa rugby union tour of South America in October although an injury sustained in a Currie Cup match restricted him to just two matches, including {{only one of the}} internationals against the South American Jaguars.|$|R
5|$|<b>Springbok</b> (Top Award) : This badge {{is the top}} Scout {{award in}} South Africa. It {{concentrates}} on teaching the Scout how {{to give back to}} the community. The <b>Springbok</b> award is the equivalent of the UK's Queen's Scout and the American Eagle Scout. Among the requirements, the Scout must complete at least 40hours of community service, lead a hike of over 30kilometres (18.6mi) in unfamiliar territory, and plan and construct a pioneering project.|$|E
5|$|<b>Springbok</b> died on March 19, 1897 at the Megibben-Edgewater farm in Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|<b>Springbok</b> {{occur in}} several {{protected}} areas across their range: Makgadikgadi and Nxai National Park (Botswana); Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park between Botswana and South Africa; Etosha National Park and Namib-Naukluft Park (Namibia); Mokala and Karoo National Parks {{and a number}} of provincial reserves in South Africa. In 1999, Rod East of the IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group estimated the <b>springbok</b> population in South Africa at more than 670,000, noting that it might be an underestimate. However, estimates for Namibia, Angola, Botswana, Transvaal, Karoo, and the Free State (which gave a total population estimate of nearly 2,000,000 – 2,500,000 animals in southern Africa), were in complete disagreement with East's estimate. <b>Springbok</b> are under active management in several private lands. Small populations have been introduced into private lands and provincial areas of KwaZulu-Natal.|$|E

5|$|The <b>springbok</b> {{has been}} a {{national}} symbol of South Africa since the white minority rule in the 20th century. It was adopted as a nickname or mascot by several South African sports teams, most famously by the national rugby union team. The <b>springbok</b> is the national animal of South Africa. Even after the decline of apartheid, Nelson Mandela intervened to keep {{the name of the}} animal for the reconciliation of rugby fans, the majority of whom were whites.|$|E
50|$|In 1951 Muller skippered South Africa at Murrayfield in Edinburgh, {{which saw}} the <b>Springboks</b> run away 44-0 winners, with Muller scoring one try. After {{defeating}} Scotland, the <b>Springboks</b> had the tough task {{of playing the}} other three home nations, as well as France {{on the rest of}} the tour. The <b>Springboks</b> made it two from two at Lansdowne Road, defeating Ireland 17-5. Muller guided the team to a closer victory in the subsequent match against Wales in Cardiff, which saw the <b>Springboks</b> keep the clean winning record on tour 3-0, winning the game 6-3, a South African drop-goal proving the difference between the two sides.|$|R
