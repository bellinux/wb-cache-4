5000|$|Gabriel Basso as Adam Jamison, Cathy and Paul's son, {{who attends}} {{the same school}} where Cathy teaches. A typical teenager, he resists his mother's sudden {{increase}} in attention and affection. He strikes an unsteady friendship with schoolmate Andrea, but it falls apart after he balks when it is insinuated by others that they are sexually intimate. After getting in trouble, he is punished by being forced to do house chores for Marlene. He {{is the first to}} realize Marlene has Alzheimer's disease. In season one episode [...] "Everything that Rises Must Converge", Marlene, not recognizing Adam, pulls a gun on him and chases him out of her home. Adam does not know about his mother's cancer until the season one finale. While his mother is in the hospital receiving treatment, he discovers a key to a storage locker that is filled with hundreds of gifts for his future birthdays, holidays and major life events. He realizes his mother is not going to live very long and finally reacts emotionally. At the beginning of season two, Adam feels frustrated with all the attention he's been getting at school due to Cathy's illness. He wants to pursue a sexual relationship with his girlfriend Mia, who he started dating at the end of season one, but she wants to take things slow. He then sleeps with classmate Emily, but refuses to take any responsibility for his actions. While his parents are away, Adam has sex with a hooker / dominatrix in their bedroom, and then has Uncle Sean help get rid of her. In the episode [...] "The Little C", it is revealed that Adam contracted crabs from his encounter with the hooker, and accidentally exposed Cathy and Paul. He confesses this to them, and Cathy tells Mia thinking Adam got it from her. Mia promptly dumps him, and refuses to give him any sympathy due to his mother's illness. He then begins chatting with a girl named Poppy through an online cancer support group. When they finally meet, Adam discovers that Poppy is actually a thirty-something year old woman. Despite this, they bond over their immature sense of humor and their parents' diseases. Before the family is supposed to go to Italy for Christmas, Adam discovers that Poppy's father has actually been dead for several years. He confronts Poppy, but she explains that once he loses his mom, he will feel like a part of him is missing. In the third season, Adam has joined a prayer group at school, where he meets the extremely religious Jesse, who becomes his girlfriend. In season four, Adam is <b>starting</b> <b>grade</b> 11. One of Cathy's pipe dreams is to see him graduate from high school before she dies. He, however, is having troubles and is failing one of his classes, Chemistry. With the help of a tutor that Cathy hires, Adam is able to pass his Chemistry exam and class. As it become clear to Adam that Cathy will most likely die while he is in Grade 11, Adam, without telling anyone in his family, decides to accelerate the completion of his degree requirements online, his frequent absences from the house which he lies to his family that he is hanging out with friends while he is really going to school to write exams. In a small, informal and previously unannounced ceremony at the Jamison home, Adam's principal, Connie Schuler, is able to hand a cap and gowned Adam his high school diploma in front of Cathy {{and the rest of the}} family.|$|E
40|$|M. Ed. Given {{the amount}} of work focused on children, it is {{surprising}} that so little is known about their lives. How little we actually know about their lived experiences. <b>Starting</b> <b>grade</b> one is a major life change and introduces the child to a new and different world. When children enter primary school, they are confronted with adjustive demands that are specific to their new environment. Research has shown that some children find this adaptation remarkably easy and that it occurs quite naturally while others experience it as traumatic, often resulting in serious consequences. The formal primary school environment is very different from what the child has previously experienced and the adjustment that he makes in grade one can {{play an important role in}} forming impressions of grade one and of school in general. This impression is then carried with that child for the rest of his life and could influence many aspects of it. This study aimed to provide the reader with a detailed description of the experiential world of the grade one child when starting school. A qualitative, exploratory, descriptive monographic (case) study was conducted within the bounded context of a grade one class. Data was obtained on the perceptions and experiences of the subjects from their own perspective by means of observation, interviews, projective techniques, questionnaires and manuscripts. Raw data was reduced and analysed by means of clustering, conceptualising and dendrograming via a process of narrative discourse. Credibility of the study was addressed through triangulation and the use of an independent coder. Objectivity was assured by provision of a clear audit trail and narrative discourse. The raw data obtained during this research was consolidated and interpreted within the boundaries of a theory framework which includes a detailed profile of the school beginner in terms of physical, cognitive, social and moral development as well as a discussion of the educational context within which the school beginner functions. Through this research, it was found that the experiential world of the grade one child when starting school can be illustrated in terms of his scholastic orientation, teacher orientation, interpersonal relationships and adjustment. Other aspects such as discipline and structure, school demands and expectations, and parental orientation were also found to influence the experience of the child. This experience was then illustrated through behaviour as well as psychological and physiological manifestations. Finally, the findings of the study were implemented in recommendations made to preschools, parents and primary schools in order to facilitate the adaptation of the grade one child so as to ensure the formation of a positive impression of school...|$|E
