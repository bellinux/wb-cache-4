40|$|Electrospray (ES) -based ambient {{ionization}} {{techniques have}} been rapidly developed and became indispensable tools for direct sample analysis using mass spectrometry. In this study, {{it was found}} that with the use of porous substrate, analytes present in complex samples could be detected by directly introducing untreated sample on porous tips. Moreover, the specific feature, micro-channels of the porous tips, allows efficient sample loading and facilitates electrospray ionization (ESI), which is beneficial for the direct sample analysis. Systematic study on the influences of the physical and chemical factors of various porous materials (polyester, polyethylene and wood) on the detection sensitivity and ionization efficiency was firstly investigated. It was found that the chemical interaction between the porous materials and analytes could significantly affect the detection sensitivity for analytes. Hydrophobic <b>spraying</b> <b>tips</b> showed better detection sensitivity for polar analytes while better detection for non-polar analytes was obtained when hydrophilic <b>spraying</b> <b>tip</b> was used. Moreover, the electrostatic properties of <b>spraying</b> <b>tips</b> could also affect the detection sensitivity for analytes. Hydrophobic materials (i. e., polyethylene and polyester) which tend to form negative charge on the surface could facilitate the ionization of analytes in negative ion mode. With a clear understanding of the effect of porous spraying materials on detection sensitivity, <b>tip</b> <b>spray</b> ionization mass spectrometric method was developed and successfully applied to direct analysis of pharmaceutical, forensic, clinical and food samples. Rotary sample stages compatible to the ion source of two commercial mass spectrometers were designed and constructed for the automation of <b>tip</b> <b>spray</b> ionization mass spectrometry, which allowed the analysis of 12 samples in less than 15 minutes.

The nitroaromatic-based explosives were ionized through electron-capture ionization and detected in radical anion form.

The characteristic data was extracted from spray images grabbed by a high speed visualization system. The results showed that the ambient pressure and injection pressure had significant effects on the spray characteristics. As the ambient pressure increased, the spray angle increased, while the <b>spray</b> <b>tip</b> penetration and the peak of average tip velocity decreased. As the injection pressure increased, the <b>spray</b> <b>tip</b> penetration, spray angle, spray area and spray volume increased. The increasing blend ratio of biodiesel brought about a shorter <b>spray</b> <b>tip</b> penetration and a smaller spray angle compared with those of diesel.

In addition to a 100 % water hyacinth arrangement, we tested arrangements with either eared watermoss or water lettuce at 75 : 25 %, 50 : 50 %, and 25 : 75 %, plus a triple density with the three species placed equally at a 33 % proportion. Dye solutions of FDC Yellow No. 5 at 3500 ppm and FDC Blue No. 1 at 1000 ppm were used as spraying tracers for TXVK- 8 and DG 11002 VS nozzles, respectively. Both solutions were sprayed on the same plot at 30 -min intervals through a CO(2) pressured backpack knapsack calibrated to deliver a spray volume around 200 L/ha. The TXVK- 8 <b>tip</b> provided greater <b>spray</b> mix deposition when compared to the DG 11002 VS tip, regardless of the plant proportions. For both <b>spray</b> <b>tips,</b> higher proportions of eared watermoss and the triple association among the plants provided the highest spray mix deposition on water hyacinth plants. The increase of spray mix deposition is likely related to the increase of eared watermoss or water lettuce as well as the decrease of water hyacinth plants in the association and consequent decreases of self covering among water hyacinth leaves.

The Rosin-Rammler two parameter model was assumed for the droplet distribution. The measurements were made at the <b>spray</b> <b>tip</b> where laser obscuration was low and the chance of multiscattering bias was minimal. Coal-water slurry fuel with 50 % coal loading by mass containing 5 gm volume mean diameter coal particles was used. Injection pressures were ranged from 28 to II 0 MPa. Three different nozzle orifice diameters, 0. 2, 0. 4, and 0. 6 mm, four axial measurement locations from 60 to 120 mm downstream of the nozzle tip were studied. Measurements were made for both pressurized (2. 07 MPa, 300 psig) and unpressurized (ambient, 0 gage) chamber conditions. The <b>spray</b> <b>tip</b> SMD showed an increase with chamber gas density, and with axial measurement location, and showed a decrease with increasing injection pressure. The effect of nozzle orifice diameter on <b>spray</b> <b>tip</b> SMDs of completely developed sprays for such high pressure injections was found to be negligible.

The sauter mean diameter values at various axial distances from the injector tip are also evaluated. A novel diesel spray model that presents the hydrodynamics features of sprays from the moments derived from a Gamma size distribution and the droplet-size distribution function, rather than from droplet-size classes, is used for the numerical predictions.

40|$|Large eddy {{simulation}} of diesel spray {{in a constant}} volume vessel {{as well as in}} an internal combustion engine has been performed. Spray is modeled using Eulerian-Lagrangian approach. The modeling involves primary and secondary break-up, the spray-induced turbulence (SIT) and the stochastic turbulence dispersion (STD) of parcels. Including SIT, based on Baharawaj et al. (2009), in coarse grids, e. g., Delta x = 0. 5 mm, hardly affects the results. With finer grids, e. g., Delta x = 0. 25 mm and Delta x = 0. 125 mm, the local mixture fraction in the downstream flow field slightly decreases whereas the prediction of the <b>spray</b> <b>tips</b> and air entrainment dose not respond to the inclusion of SIT. In the constant volume vessel configuration, including STD in the model is shown to be crucial in obtaining predictive results. It is shown that a simulation excluding STD leads to an unrealistic prediction of the spray shape, over-prediction of the liquid and vapor lengths and erroneous distribution of the mixture fraction and air entrainment. Further investigation on the SIT and STD effects is carried out in practical internal combustion engine operating under a partially premixed charge (PPC) compression ignition condition where the PPC condition is obtained by employing a triple-injection strategy during the late engine compression stroke. It is found that when STD is not included, the fuel spray wall-wetting as well as the fuel spray parcels residing in the cylinder wall vicinity are increased. Furthermore, an unrealistic distribution of mixture fraction in the in-cylinder gases is observed. The results suggest {{that it is necessary to}} consider models for particle dispersion when LES of internal combustion engines is performed, in order to properly capture the combustion phasing. The significance of STD is found to increase when the ambient air density is low. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

One such high potential spray application {{is in the}} medical coating industry with strict requirements of high precision, high consistency, and considerable drug cost.

This is mostly {{due to the fact}} that pressurized air and/or ultrasonic vibration which introduces much turbulence to spray droplets in flight. To further improve transfer efficiency and consistency of existing spray nozzles, SSCo has developed a new airless Electrostatic spray nozzle which relies solely on electrostatic charges accumulated in a unique spray tube design to gently applied coating material in a consistent and efficient manner. An added benefit is to have steady spray at flow rates ranging from 3 cc/hr- 10 cc/hr. An analysis of various spray tube tips is performed, each having different geometry making full use of Gauss' Law to concentrate electrostatic charge and maximizing electric field strength at terminal spray point. A particular point of interest will be how the droplet shape, distribution, and size are affected by the different designs. Lab testing indicated that the larger sharp edge areas where electric charge accumulates, the smaller the droplet size while droplet shape sphericity stays relatively constant. This is concluded from results showing that a <b>spray</b> <b>tip</b> with a circumferential corner area produces smaller droplets than that with 4 points.

The cluster nozzle was investigated with different injection pressure under part load conditions and high load conditions in a single cylinder Diesel engine and it was compared with a reference nozzle.

Planar droplet size distribution of the spray from the injector has been investigated by means of uncertainty analysis of the LIF and Mie scattering images. Larger droplets exist in the <b>spray</b> <b>tip</b> and periphery of the spray, and the standard deviation of droplet size distribution are also high in these region. Examining both the droplet size and size distribution images provide more details of the transient spray development...|$|E
50|$|The company's main {{products}} were their 3-ton and 5-ton wagons, {{and these were}} produced in {{a whole range of}} variations, including Articulated 6-wheeler, Gully cleaning wagon, Brewers wagon, Bus bodied wagon, Municipal dustcart, Street watering wagon, Tar <b>spraying</b> wagon, <b>Tipping</b> wagon and many more. In addition the company produced a range of tractors for both road and agricultural use. Another popular product for municipal use was their lightweight patching roller, used for road repair. In 1924 the company introduced their superb Mann Express wagon, with shaft drive, high-speed engine and fully enclosed cab. Unfortunately this wagon was not a commercial success and by 1926 Mann's Patent Steam Cart and Wagon Company was in trouble. Despite attempts to provide additional finance {{it was not possible to}} save the company, and in 1929 the works closed completely.|$|R
40|$|Bombardier beetles, when {{physically}} assaulted, eject a hot quinonoid <b>spray</b> {{from the}} <b>tip</b> of the abdomen. Photographic evidence is presented demonstrating that the African bombardier beetle, Stenaptinus insignis, can aim its spray in virtually any direction. It can target its individual legs, {{and even the}} individual segments of its legs. Moreover, in aiming at a leg, it {{takes into account the}} postural orientation of that leg. The beetle is able even to target sites on its back. It is postulated that the ability to aim helps the beetle mainly in defense against ants...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} digital imaging and image processing techniques for the quantitative characterization of diesel sprays. An optically accessible, constant volume chamber was configured to allow direct photographic imaging of diesel sprays, which were generated from a six-hole nozzle in a non-evaporating and pressurized environment. A high-resolution CCD camera and a flash light source were used to capture {{the images of the}} sprays. Dedicated image processing software has been developed to quantify a set of macroscopic, characteristic parameters of the <b>sprays</b> including <b>tip</b> penetration, near- and far-field angles. The spray parameters produced using this software are compared with those obtained using manual methods. The results obtained under typical spray conditions demonstrate that the software is capable of producing more accurate, consistent and efficient results than the manual methods. An application of the imaging processing software to the characterization of diesel sprays for a valve covered orifice nozzle is also presented and discussed...|$|R
