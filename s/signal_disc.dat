40|$|We {{have found}} that sounds {{containing}} high-frequency components above the human audible range (20 kHz) significantly increase the regional blood flow in the deep-lying brain structure {{and the power of}} the alpha frequency range of the spontaneous electroencephalogram (EEG), and positively affect sound perception. We have termed this phenomenon the “hypersonic effect ” [1]. To carry out further experiments on this effect, we developed “Authentic <b>Signal</b> <b>Disc</b> ” that is super audio CD (SACD) software containing the authentic signals for the hypersonic effect and “Authentic Hypersonic Audio System ” that could reproduce the hypersonic effect. ”Authentic Hypersonic Audio System ” consists of a custom-made SACD player, a de-emphasis controller, filters, two stereo power amplifiers, an output meter unit, and two-way stereo speakers and tweeters. Using these system and disc, we examined recorded EEGs, psychological evaluations based on Scheffe's method, and behavioral evaluations on the optimum listening level, and confirmed the introduction of the hypersonic effect. This system enables us to create some new applications of auditory display. 1...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Limited {{reliability}} data exist for localised {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) findings relevant to planning of treatment with lumbar disc prosthesis and later outcomes. We assessed the reliability of such findings in chronic low back pain patients who were accepted candidates for disc prosthesis. Methods: On pretreatment MRI of 170 patients (mean age 41 years; 88 women), three experienced radiologists independently rated Modic changes, disc findings and facet arthropathy at L 3 /L 4, L 4 /L 5 and L 5 /S 1. Two radiologists rerated 126 examinations. For each MRI finding at each disc level, agreement was analysed using the kappa statistic and differences in prevalence across observers using a fixed effects model. Results: All findings at L 3 /L 4 and facet arthropathy at L 5 /S 1 had a mean prevalence < 10 % across observers and were not further analysed, ensuring interpretable kappa values. Overall interobserver agreement was generally moderate or good (kappa 0. 40 – 0. 77) at L 4 –S 1 for Modic changes, nucleus pulposus <b>signal,</b> <b>disc</b> height (subjective and measured), posterior high-intensity zone (HIZ) and disc contour, and fair (kappa 0. 24) at L 4 /L 5 for facet arthropathy. Posterior HIZ at L 5 /S 1 and severely reduced subjective disc height at L 4 /L 5 differed up to threefold in prevalence between observers (p< 0. 0001). Intraobserver agreement was mostly good or very good (kappa 0. 60 – 1. 00). Conclusion: In candidates for disc prosthesis, mostly moderate interobserver agreement is expected for localised MRI findings. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background and objective: In {{candidates}} for lumbar disc prosthesis, limited reliability data exist for {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) findings relevant to planning of treatment and to evaluation of outcome after treatment. In this subgroup of patients with low back pain (LBP), we assessed the reliability of degenerative MRI findings and change in such findings over time. How the sum of MRI findings relates {{to the degree of}} disability and LBP was also evaluated since this is not clear. Materials and Methods: 170 of 173 patients aged 25 - 55 years, with LBP ≥ 1 year, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score ≥ 30 %, and localized degenerative MRI changes at L 4 /L 5 and/or L 5 /S 1 were included. On pre-treatment images three experienced radiologists independently rated Modic changes, disc findings, and facet arthropathy (FA) at L 3 -S 1. Two of the radiologists rated progress and regress of the same findings on 2 -year follow up images (n = 126). Agreement was analysed using the kappa statistic. How pre-treatment MRI total score related to the ODI (n = 170) and LBP intensity scores (n = 165) was analysed using multiple linear regression adjusting for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking, and anxiety/depression. Results: Overall interobserver agreement was generally moderate or good (kappa 0. 40 - 0. 77) at L 4 -S 1 for Modic changes, nucleus pulposus <b>signal,</b> <b>disc</b> height, posterior HIZ, and disc contour, and fair (kappa 0. 24) at L 4 /L 5 for FA. Intraobserver agreement was mostly good or very good (kappa 0. 60 - 1. 00). Image comparison indicated good interobserver agreement on progress and regress (prevalence and bias adjusted kappa (PABAK) 0. 63 - 1. 00) for Modic changes, posterior HIZ, disc height, and disc contour at L 3 -S 1 and for nucleus pulposus signal and FA at L 3 /L 4; and moderate interobserver agreement (PABAK 0. 46 - 0. 59) on decreasing nucleus signal and increasing FA at L 4 -S 1. The MRI total score was not related to ODI (regression coefficient 0. 12, P = 0. 79) or LBP intensity (regression coefficient 0. 64, P = 0. 37). Conclusions and consequences: In {{candidates for}} lumbar disc prosthesis or fusion, Modic and disc findings, and change in these findings over time, have acceptable reliability for use in treatment planning and research, but the sum of these findings are unlikely to explain variation in current pre-treatment disability and pain. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{expression}} {{levels of}} caspase- 8 inhibitory c-FLIP proteins {{play an important}} role in regulating death receptor-mediated apoptosis, as their concentration at the moment when the death-inducing <b>signaling</b> complex (<b>DISC)</b> is formed determines the outcome of the <b>DISC</b> <b>signal.</b> Experimental studies have shown that c-FLIP proteins are subject to dynamic turnover and that their stability and expression levels can be rapidly altered. Even though the influence of c-FLIP on the apoptotic behavior of a single cell has been captured in mathematical simulation studies, the effect of c-FLIP turnover and stability has not been investigated. In this study, a mathematical model of apoptosis was developed to analyze how the dynamic turnover and stability of the c-FLIP isoforms regulate apoptotic signaling for both individual cells and cell populations. Intercellular parameter and concentration distributions were used to describe the behavior of cell populations. Monte-Carlo simulations of cell populations showed that c-FLIP turnover is a key determinant of death receptor responses.

40|$|AbstractApoptosis is {{mediated}} by a highly regulated signal transduction cascade that eventually leads to precisely directed cell death. The death-inducing <b>signaling</b> complex (<b>DISC),</b> composed of Fas, FADD, and caspase- 8, is an apical signaling complex that mediates receptor-induced apoptosis. We have docked the experimentally determined {{structures of the}} Fas and FADD death domains into {{a model of a}} partial <b>DISC</b> <b>signaling</b> complex. The arrangement of Fas and FADD was determined using the interaction modes of the two heterodimer crystal structures determined to date, Pelle/Tube and Apaf- 1 /procaspase- 9. The proposed model reveals that both interactions can be accommodated in a single multimeric complex. Importantly, the model is consistent with reported site-directed mutagenesis data indicating residues throughout the domain are critical for function. These results imply that members of the death domain superfamily have the potential for multivalent interactions, offering novel possibilities for regulation of apoptotic signaling...|$|R
50|$|The binding of Fas ligand to Fas {{receptor}} triggers trimerization of Fas, whose cytoplasmic domain is then able to {{bind the}} death {{domain of the}} adaptor protein FADD (Fas-associated protein with death domain). Procaspase 8 binds to FADD's death effector domain (DED) and proteolytically self-activates as caspase 8.

40|$|The death-inducing <b>signaling</b> complex (<b>DISC)</b> is {{critical}} for initiation of death-receptor-mediated apoptosis; however, paradoxically, CD 95 also signals for cell survival. Here, we reconstitute a functional DISC using only purified CD 95, FADD, and procaspase- 8 and unveil a two-step activation mechanism involving both dimerization and proteolytic cleavage of procaspase- 8 that is obligatory for death-receptor-induced apoptosis. Initially, dimerization yields active procaspase- 8 with a very restricted substrate repertoire, limited to itself or c-FLIP. Proteolytic cleavage is then required to fully activate caspase- 8, thereby permitting DISC-mediated cleavage of the critical exogenous apoptotic substrates, caspase- 3 and Bid. This switch in catalytic activity and substrate range is a key determinant of <b>DISC</b> <b>signaling,</b> as cellular expression of noncleavable procaspase- 8 mutants, which undergo DISC-mediated oligomerization, but not cleavage, fails to initiate CD 95 -induced apoptosis.
