40|$|The study {{includes}} {{measurements of}} height, weight, sitting height, upper arm circumference, triceps and subscapular skinfolds and maturity (bone age and age at menarche) of a cross-sectional sample of 4, 3 89 white subjects aged 1 to 16 years and 8, 297 white subjects aged 18 to 74 years, both samples being {{derived from the}} National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey I (NHANES I) data sets. Sex- and age-specific percentiles for bone age and age at menarche were calculated and subjects classified into two maturity groups: advanced and delayed. These two groups were then compared with respect to both body size and body proportions. The results show that advanced maturation in children is associated with increases in stature, weight, skinfold thicknesses, muscle size and sitting height but not with differences in <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> <b>index,</b> which suggests that variability in maturity rate does not affect body proportions. Among adult women differences in recalled age at menarche were not associated with differences {{in any of the}} anthropometric dimensions, suggesting that maturity- related differences are of a transitory nature...|$|E
40|$|This study {{brings the}} {{information}} on linear body proportionality of pubescent boys. The body linear proportionality was validated by using the SD scores gained from the measured data and by validating the individual proportionality with help of natural Percal indices. Each child was considered according to his biological maturity by using KEI index. For rating {{of the growth of}} individual and his proportionality, the compliance of KEI index and the difference of height and chronological age were validated. The considering of those biological trends made it possible to separate the individuals with possible physiological variant of normal growth from the individuals with suspective growth pathology. The set included 346 boys in the age of 10 - 14 years, after replacing of disproportional individuals from the study. For evaluation of changes in the linear body proportionality the linear somatic markers with high degree of accuracy and reliability of measurement were chosen and the descriptional statistics were set to these parameters and to their indices. Comparing with reference sets the changes in proportional relations in year and half-year cathegories were described.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} secular {{changes in}} body and head dimensions in adult {{females and males}} of different ages from Sardinia (Italy). The cross sectional sample consists of 863 individuals, 412 women and 451 men. They {{were born in the}} metropolitan Cagliari area, southern Sardinia, of parents native to the same area. The women and men were divided into four 5 -year age groups, the first with individuals 20. 00 to 24. 99 years old, the last with individuals 35. 00 to 39. 99 years old. The ANOVA results suggest that the secular trend in body dimensions is still present in both Sardinian males and females, as shown by the significant differences in height (p≤ 0. 05) and estimated lower limb length (p≤ 0. 001), with the youngest age group (20. 00 - 24. 99) presenting the highest values. The relative <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> <b>index,</b> whose distributions are also significantly different, decrease from the first age group to the last (p≤ 0. 001). These differences do not disappear after ANCOVA (controlling for SES). Comparison of the cephalic index results with those of previous samples of Sardinian males seems to indicate a long-term trend toward brachycephalization. However, while the differences in head dimensions are not statistically significant, they suggest a recent trend toward debrachycephalization. Therefore, while the secular trend of height and above all of estimated lower limb length is still appreciable, that of the head dimensions has a lesser magnitude...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the anthropometric and physical characteristics of youth elite paddlers and to identify the differences between kayakers and canoeists. A total of 171 male paddlers (eighty-nine kayakers and eighty-two canoeists), aged 13. 69 ± 0. 57 years (mean ± SD) volunteered to participate in this study. The participants completed basic anthropometric assessments (body mass, stretch stature, <b>sitting</b> <b>height,</b> body mass <b>index,</b> maturity level, sum of 6 skinfolds and fat mass percentage) as well as a battery of physical fitness tests (overhead medicine ball throw, counter movement jump, sit-and-reach and 20 m multi-stage shuttle run tests). The anthropometric results revealed a significantly larger body size (stretch stature and <b>sitting</b> <b>height)</b> and body mass in the kayakers (p < 0. 01) as well as a more mature biological status (p = 0. 003). The physical fitness level exhibited by the kayakers was likewise significantly greater than that of the canoeists, both in the counter movement jump and estimated VO 2 max (p < 0. 05), as well as in the overhead medicine ball throw and sit-and-reach test (p < 0. 01). These findings confirm the more robust and mature profile of youth kayakers that might be associated with the superior fitness level observed and the specific requirements of this sport discipline...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{patterns}} of height loss with age in the Anglo, black, and Mexican-American populations of the United States has been undertaken. The study was based on data gathered by the United States Public Health Service in the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Estimates of height loss were obtained by subtracting present stature from a calculated maximum attained height derived from sex- and race/ethnic-specific regression equations relating stature to subischial length. Anglo women have greater height losses than Anglo, black, or Mexican-American males, and black or Mexican-American females. Between 24 and 74 years of age, Anglo women average 3. 8 cm. loss in stature. The black populations lose less height than Anglos or Mexican-Americans. Mexican-Americans lose less height than Anglos from 24 to 54 years and then have a greatly increased height loss so that by age 74 their total height loss {{is the same as}} Anglos. Standing <b>height,</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>height,</b> body mass <b>index,</b> and the Poverty Index were found to be negatively correlated with height loss.

40|$|The paper aims to {{draw out}} {{biosocial}} correlates of nutrition through body mass index (BMI) and chronic energy deficiency (CED). The findings are based on cross-sectional data of 446 women aged 18 - 60 years from six different endogamous groups of two ecological zones. The mean age of studied women varied from 31 to 36 years. The mean age at menarche {{was found to be}} 14. 50 ± 1. 32 years. Similarly mean age at menopause was found to be 46. 22 ± 4. 00 years. The mean of reproductive life span varied from 27 to 35 years. Average number of pregnancies per women was 4. 44 ± 2. 52, average foetal loss was 0. 11, children surviving per women was 3. 61, whereas average child loss per women was found to be 0. 62 and average family size was 9. 51. Variations in mean BMI kg/m 2 between populations ranged between 18. 56 and 20. 71. Prevalence of CED was highest among the Brahmin women of Uttarakhand (58. 3 %) followed by Ahirwar of Madhya Pradesh (47. 1 %). Incidence of CED was found lowest among Brahmin women of Madhya Pradesh (24. 0 %). Linear regression coefficient (b ± standard error) of BMI on Cormic Index for these women was 33. 1 ± 8. 1 (t= 4. 0, p= 0. 001), and correlation coefficient (R) was 0. 189. Out of 6 anthropometric variables considered for regression analysis, 5, namely weight, hip circumference, waist circumference, mid arm circumference and <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> showed significant correlations with BMI. Significant differences in <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> and Cormic <b>Index</b> of women from the hills and plains indicate the role of ecology in shaping its habitants.

40|$|Associations {{of breast}} cancer overall with {{indicators}} of exposures during puberty are reasonably well characterized; however, uncertainty remains regarding the associations of <b>height,</b> leg length, <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> and menarcheal age with hormone receptor-defined malignancies. Within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort, Cox proportional hazards models were {{used to describe the}} relationships of adult height, leg length and <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> and age at menarche with risk of estrogen and progesterone receptor negative (ER-PR-) (n = 990) and ER+PR+ (n = 3, 524) breast tumors. Height as a single risk factor was compared to a model combining leg length and <b>sitting</b> <b>height.</b> The possible interactions of height, leg length and <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> with menarche were also analyzed. Risk of both ER-PR- and ER+PR+ malignancies was positively associated with standing height, leg length and <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> and inversely associated with increasing age at menarche. For ER+PR+ disease, <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> (hazard ratios: 1. 14 [95 % confidence interval: 1. 08 – 1. 20]) had a stronger risk association than leg length (1. 05 [1. 00 – 1. 11]). In comparison, for ER-PR- disease, no distinct differences were observed between leg length and <b>sitting</b> <b>height.</b> Women who were tall and had an early menarche (= 13 years) showed an almost twofold increase in risk of ER+PR+ tumors but no such increase in risk was observed for ER-PR- disease. Indicators of exposures during rapid growth periods were associated with risks of both HR-defined breast cancers. Exposures during childhood promoting faster development may establish risk associations for both HR-positive and -negative malignancies. The stronger associations of the components of height with ER+PR+ tumors among older women suggest possible hormonal links that could be specific for postmenopausal women...|$|R
40|$|Objectives The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{correlate}} <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> measured by stadiometry with lumbar spine height (LSH) modifications measured by musculoskeletal ultrasonography (MSU). Methods Eighteen healthy young adults were recruited for this study (mean age: 21. 5 ± 1. 5 years).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Tallness has {{consistently}} {{been associated with}} an increased risk of breast cancer. We investigated the association further by decomposing height into leg length and <b>sitting</b> <b>height.</b> METHODS: From the prospective Danish cohort ‘Diet, Cancer and Health’, 23 864 postmenopausal women enrolled during 1993 – 1997 were followed for a diagnosis of breast cancer in the Danish Cancer Registry through 2009. RESULTS: The incidence rate ratios for breast cancer were 1. 11 (95 % CI 1. 06 – 1. 16) for each 5 cm increase in total height and 1. 09 (95 % CI 1. 01 – 1. 17) and 1. 14 (95 % CI 1. 04 – 1. 25) for each 5 cm increase in leg length and <b>sitting</b> <b>height,</b> respectively.

40|$|Objectives: Leg {{length and}} {{relative}} leg length {{are considered to}} be reliable markers of prepubertal living conditions. Cessation of leg growth, driven by estrogen, occurs earlier in puberty in girls than boys. We hypothesized that leg length and relative leg length, as <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> to leg ratio, might have sex-specific associations with age of puberty. Methods: We used multivariable linear regression in 10, 046 older (≥ 50 years) Chinese from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (Phase 3) to examine the associations of recalled age of puberty (women: age of menarche, and men: mean age of first nocturnal emission, voice breaking, and first pubic hair) with subischeal leg length, <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> to leg ratio, and <b>sitting</b> <b>height.</b> Results: Leg length and <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> to leg ratio had different associations with age of puberty in men and women (P-values for interaction < 0. 001), but <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> did not. Per year earlier puberty, legs were longer among men by 0. 09 cm (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 01 - 0. 18) and shorter among women by 20. 16 cm (95 % CI 20. 20 to 20. 12). Further adjustment for age, hip size (as a marker of buttock fat), and several markers of childhood conditions did not obviate the difference in association by sex. Conclusions: Adult leg length and relative leg length (<b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> to leg ratio) may be biomarkers of different exposures in men and women, with corresponding implications for their interpretation as a biomarker of early life exposures. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Knowing {{the timing}} of the pubertal growth spurt of the spine, {{represented}} by <b>sitting</b> <b>height,</b> is essential for the prognosis and therapy of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. There are several indicators that reflect growth or remaining growth of the patient. For example, distal body parts have their growth spurt earlier in adolescence, and therefore the growth of the foot can be an early indicator for the growth spurt of <b>sitting</b> <b>height.</b> Shoe size is a good alternative for foot length, since patients can remember when they bought new shoes and what size these shoes were. Therefore the clinician already has access to some longitudinal data at the first visit of the patient to the outpatient clinic. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the increase in shoe size during adolescence and to determine whether {{the timing of}} the peak increase could be an early indicator for {{the timing of the}} peak growth velocity of <b>sitting</b> <b>height.</b> Methods Data concerning shoe sizes of girls and boys were acquired from two large shoe shops from 1991 to 2008. The longitudinal series of 242 girls and 104 boys were analysed for the age of the "peak increase" in shoe size, as well as the age of cessation of foot growth based on shoe size. Results The average peak increase in shoe size occurred at 10. 4 years (SD 1. 1) in girls and 11. 5 years (SD 1. 5) in boys. This was on average 1. 3 years earlier than the average peak growth velocity of <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> in girls, and 2. 5 years earlier in boys. The increase in shoe size diminishes when the average peak growth velocity of <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> takes place at respectively 12. 0 (SD 0. 8) years in girls, and 13. 7 (SD 1. 0) years in boys. Conclusions Present data suggest that the course of the shoe size of children visiting the outpatient clinic can be a useful first tool for predicting the timing of the pubertal growth spurt of <b>sitting</b> <b>height,</b> as a representative for spinal length. This claim needs verification by direct comparison of individual shoe size and <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> data and than a step forward can be made in clinical decision making regarding adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. </p...|$|R

A height for the articulation of 43. 5 cm above the H-point of a reference seat was theoretically deduced based on a population with an average <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> of 88 cm. Participants evaluated the articulated seat in comparison with the reference seat. Twelve participants were divided into three groups of <b>sitting</b> <b>height.</b> In a laboratory environment subjective comfort evaluations and preferred values of deployment of the articulation and of counter-tilting of the headrest were registered. Driving on the roads completed and validated the laboratory assessments. The reference seat was deemed less comfortable for the participants with short and medium <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> than for the tall ones.

40|$|Aim In an anthropometric assessment, {{elderly are}} {{frequently}} unable to measure their height due to mobility and skeletal deformities. An {{alternative is to}} use a surrogate value of stature from arm span, knee <b>height,</b> and <b>sitting</b> <b>height.</b> The equations developed for predicting height in Indonesian elderly using these three predictors. The equations put in the nutritional assessment card (NSA) of older people. Before the card which is the first new technology in Indonesia will be applied in the community, it should be tested. The study aimed was to conduct diagnostic test of predicted height model in the card compared to actual height. Methods Model validation towards 400 healthy elderly conducted in Jakarta City with cross-sectional design. The study was the second validation test of the model besides Depok City representing semi urban area which was undertaken as the first study. Result Male elderly had higher mean age, height, weight, arm span, knee <b>height,</b> and <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> as compared to female elderly. The highest correlation between knee height and standing height was similar in women (r = 0. 80; P < 0. 001) and men (r = 0. 78; P < 0. 001), and followed by arm span and <b>sitting</b> <b>height.</b> Knee height had the lowest difference with standing height in men (3. 13 cm) and women (2. 79 cm). Knee height had the biggest sensitivity (92. 2 %), and the highest specificity on <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> (91. 2 %).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Three {{questions}} were addressed: (1) Do female gymnasts have adolescent growth spurts in <b>height,</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>height,</b> and leg length? (2) Are the sequence {{and magnitude of}} spurts comparable with female adolescent non-athletes? (3) How do the data compare with other female gymnasts and with short girls? STUDY DESIGN: <b>Height</b> and <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> were measured annually on 15 Belgian gymnasts from 8. 7 +/- 1. 5 to 15. 5 +/- 1. 5 years. The gymnasts trained, on average, approximately 15 h/wk. Leg length was estimated as <b>height</b> minus <b>sitting</b> <b>height.</b> The Preece-Baines Model I was fitted to individual growth records to estimate ages at peak velocity and peak velocities for the three dimensions. Age at menarche and skeletal age were also assessed. RESULTS: Gymnasts have clearly defined adolescent spurts in height, estimated leg length, and <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> that occur approximately 1 year later and are slightly less intense than in nonathletic adolescent girls. Age at menarche and skeletal age are consistent with later somatic maturation.

40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access. Background: We analyse the NHANES III sample {{to assess the}} {{suitability}} of measured stature and <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> to estimate leg length (tibia + femur) and predict fatness. High rates of overweight in the United States population may lead to greater gluteo-femoral fat mass which will increase <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> and artificially decrease estimates of both absolute and relative leg length. Methods: The analyses include 3076 women and 3233 men, 20. 0 - 49. 9 years of age of White, Black or Mexican-American ethnicity. The poverty index ratio, measured stature, <b>sitting</b> <b>height,</b> upper leg length, weight, four skinfolds, buttocks circumference and elbow, biacromial and biiliac breadths were extracted from the database. The <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> ratio, % body fatness, % upper leg length (ULL/stature), and other indices were estimated. Correlation and principle component analysis {{were used to assess}} the relationship between measures of body fatness, relative leg length and the other variables. Results: For adults in the NHANES III %body fat is more strongly correlated with buttocks circumference (r = 0. 87 and 0. 78 for women and men), than with any measure of estimated leg length (r's range from - 0. 28 to - 0. 10 for both sexes). Principle components analysis separates fatness, stature and estimated leg length into uncorrelated factors for this sample. Conclusion: Reports of a negative association between leg length and fatness for adults of the NHANES III are likely spurious, due to greater gluteo-femoral fat thickness increasing <b>sitting</b> <b>height.</b> Future rounds of the NHANES, and similar surveys in other nations with high body fat populations, should measure lower extremity length directly to better assess its relationship to health and disease risk. © The Author 2008; all rights reserved...|$|R

AIS girls had significantly shorter height (P= 0. 001), corrected height (P= 0. 005), arm span (P= 0. 022), <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> (P= 0. 005) and leg length (P= 0. 004) than the controls at pubertal stage I. From pubertal stages II through V, corrected height (Pless than or equal to 0. 033) and arm span (Pless than or equal to 0. 038) were significantly longer in the AIS than controls. Corrected <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> was also longer in AIS from stages II through IV (Pless than or equal to 0. 043). Furthermore, BMI of AIS was significantly lower than that of controls from stages II through IV (Pless than or equal to 0. 038). In addition, significant correlations of the curve severity versus weight, BMI, and arm span were also found (Pless than or equal to 0. 048). Conclusions. Various body segmental lengths were initially significantly shorter in AIS before puberty. However, after the onset of puberty, significantly longer corrected height, arm span, and various body segments were found, And there were significant correlations between anthropometric parameters and the scoliotic curve severity. Results of this large-scale study revealed the presence of abnormal growth in AIS patients during peri-pubertal development. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundIt {{has been}} {{suggested}} that longitudinal rather than cross-sectional growth standards be used to assess individual growth patterns. Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} follow boys and girls throughout their pubertal years, so that a mixed longitudinal growth curve of <b>height,</b> weight, <b>sitting</b> <b>height,</b> arm span, skinfold thickness, body mass index (BMI), and the ratio of <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> or arm span to stature, could be obtained. MethodsA defined group of 1, 139 healthy schoolchildren (570 boys and 569 girls) from the Shih-Pai district of Taipei were followed longitudinally for 4 years. Anthropometric measurements of <b>height,</b> weight, <b>sitting</b> <b>height,</b> arm span, skinfold thickness, and BMI, were obtained for each child. ResultsPeak sitting-height velocities of 6. 1 cm/year (boys) and 6. 3 cm/year (girls) were seen at 8. 5 years. The second peak of sitting-height velocity occurred at a mean age of 12. 5 years for boys and 11. 5 years for girls. Sitting-height velocity for the whole year covering the second peak was 4. 6 cm in boys and 3. 2 cm in girls. Peak arm-span velocity was seen at 13. 5 years for boys and 8. 5 years for girls, and arm-span velocity for the whole year covering this peak was 8. 4 cm/year for boys and 8. 1 cm/year for girls.

40|$|In a {{cross-sectional}} study of growth, 5, 155 children (2, 591 females, 2, 564 males) {{from the town}} of Zagreb (Croatia) were measured. Four traits of linear dimensionality (stature, <b>sitting</b> <b>height,</b> arm and leg lengths) were studied in the age span of 3 to 18 years. A significant average annual increase of all four anthropometric parameters were observed up to 14 and 15 years of age in girls and 16 years of age in boys, showing that girls had a shorter growing period. In the prepubertal period until 9 years of age, gender differences were negligible. At the age of 10, boys were overgrown by girls in all parameters due to the earlier onset of puberty in girls. The growth gains for girls, when compared with those for boys, show a different pattern across variables. The female growth advantage remained in a two years period for the limbs length, but in a three year period for stature and the longest, for 4 years, for <b>sitting</b> <b>height.</b> The male predominance in size had an onset at the age of 13 for the limbs and in the age of 14 for stature and <b>sitting</b> <b>height.</b> The patterns of sexual dimorphism in stature and <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> during growing years are similar to those observed in other populations of Europe.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to describe the relationship between the level of flexibility (sit-and-reach test) and relative <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> (<b>sitting</b> height/body <b>height</b> ratio). The survey was conducted between 2011 - 13 in 1370 individuals (739 women and 631 men) divided into 6 age groups: 18 - 29 (n= 451), 30 - 39 (n= 310), 40 - 49 (n= 248), 50 - 59 (n= 147) 60 - 69 (n= 164) and 70 + years (n= 50). Flexibility was measured using the sit-andreach test, according to the methodology of Eurofit (3 attempts, only the best one was recorded). The values of relative <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> were computed from the ratio between <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> and total body height. he results showed that there is a significant correlation between the examined variables (r = 0. 213), i. e. a proportionally longer trunk and shorter legs may {{have an impact on the}} result of sit-and-reach test, but the correlation is low (r 2 = 0. 045).

40|$|Objectives This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} changes and interrelationships between changes in selected anthropometric growth parameters and motor and physical fitness, among boys over a 2 year period during mid-adolescence. Methods Speed, agility, hand-eye coordination, explosive power, muscle strength, and aerobic endurance were measured once a year, and the anthropometric measurements (stature, body mass, <b>sitting</b> <b>height,</b> arm span, and <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> ratio), were measured {{three times per}} year, 4 months apart (among 73 adolescent boys). A hierarchical linear model, adjusting for covariates and partial correlation analysis (R 2) were {{used to analyze the}} data. Results All anthropometric, motor, and physical measurements improved significantly over the two-year period. Significantly, greater changes were seen between 13 and 14 years in stature, arm span, <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> and body mass. Changes in muscle strength, speed and agility were mainly significant between 13 and 14 years while the biggest changes occurred in explosive power and upper-body-arm-and-shoulder-strength during year 2 (14 – 15 years). The majority of interrelationships, indicating moderate to small relationships, were found between changes in stature, arm span, and <b>sitting</b> <b>height,</b> and changing strength, speed, agility, and hand eye coordination over the two-year period, after adjusting for maturity age and physical activity levels. Conclusion Motor and physical fitness improved significantly from 13 to 15 years, showing definite interrelationships with anthropometric growth during the mid-adolescence period. Awareness and education about these changes are recommended as it can have significant effects on the sport performance and fitness training of boys during mid-adolescence. Am. J. Hum.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between vowel formants {{and the second}} subglottal resonance (Sg 2) has previously been explored in English, German, Hungarian and Korean. Results from these studies indicate that vowel space is categorically divided by Sg 2 and that Sg 2 correlates well with standing height. One {{of the goals of}} this work is to verify if the above findings hold true in Mandarin as well. The correlation between Sg 2 and <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> (trunk length) is also studied. Further, since Mandarin is a tonal language (with more pitch variations compared to English), we study the {{relationship between}} Sg 2 and fundamental frequency (F 0). A new corpus of simultaneous recordings of speech and subglottal acoustics was collected from 20 native Mandarin speakers. Results on this corpus indicate that Sg 2 divides vowel space in Mandarin as well, and that it is more correlated with <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> than standing height. Paired t-tests are conducted on the Sg 2 measurements from different vowel parts, which represent different F 0 regions.

Previous studies have reported divergent associations for height and chronic disease mortality, with positive associations observed for cancer mortality but inverse associations for circulatory disease mortality. Sitting height might be more strongly associated with insulin resistance; however, data on <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> and mortality is sparse. Using the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study, a prospective cohort of 409, 748 individuals, we examined adult <b>height</b> and <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> in relation to all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Height was measured {{in the majority of}} participants; <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> was measured in ~ 253, 000 participants. During an average of 12. 5 years of follow-up, 29, 810 deaths (11, 931 from cancer and 7, 346 from circulatory disease) were identified. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for death were calculated using multivariable Cox regression within quintiles of height. Height was positively associated with cancer mortality (men: HRQ 5 vs. Q 1 = 1. 11, 95 %CI = 1. 00 - 1. 24; women: HRQ 5 vs. Q 1 = 1. 17, 95 %CI = 1. 07 - 1. 28).
