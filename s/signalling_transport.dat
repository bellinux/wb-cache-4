Despite significant efforts to predict transmembrane protein topology, comparatively little attention has been directed toward developing a method to pack the helices together.

Using molecular dynamics data, we have trained and cross-validated a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to predict per residue lipid exposure with 69 % accuracy. This information is combined with additional features to train a second SVM to predict residue contacts which are then used to determine helix-helix interaction with up to 65 % accuracy under stringent cross-validation on a non-redundant test set. Our method is also able to discriminate native from decoy helical packing arrangements with up to 70 % accuracy. Finally, we employ a force-directed algorithm to construct the optimal helical packing arrangement which demonstrates success for proteins containing up to 13 transmembrane helices.

In this work, a 454 -pyrosequencing transcriptome analysis of H. vastatrix germinating urediniospores (gU) and appressoria (Ap) was performed and compared to previously published in planta haustoria-rich (H) data. A total of 9234 transcripts were identified and annotated. Ca. 50 % of these transcripts showed no significant homology to international databases. Only 784 sequences were shared by the three conditions, and 75 % were exclusive of either gU (2146), Ap (1479) or H (3270).

Aggregation of Fc epsilon RI, the high-affinity IgE receptor, causes {{a significant increase in}} the amount of p 53 / 56 lyn associated with these low-density membrane domains. Under our standard conditions for lysis, IgE-Fc epsilon RI fractionates with the majority of the solubilized proteins, whereas aggregated receptor complexes are found at a higher density in the gradient. Stimulated translocation of p 53 / 56 lyn is accompanied by increased tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins in the low-density membrane domains as well as enhanced in vitro tyrosine kinase activity toward these proteins and an exogenous substrate. With a lower detergent-to-cell ratio during lysis, significant Fc epsilon RI remains associated with these membrane domains, consistent with the ability to coimmunoprecipitate tyrosine kinase activity with Fc epsilon RI under similar lysis conditions [Pribluda, V.

To examine the diversity of the archaeal community associated with the polychaete tubes, we constructed libraries by direct PCR amplification and cloning of 16 S rRNA genes. Almost half of the sequences of the 16 S rRNA gene libraries clustered with uncultured archaeal groups. In an effort to access genomic information from uncultured archaeal members we further constructed a fosmid library from the same DNA source. One of the clones, Alv-FOS 5, was sequenced completely. Its sequence analysis revealed an incomplete rRNA operon and 32 predicted ORFs.

40|$|Abstract A {{large number}} of network {{services}} rely on IP and reliable transport protocols. For applications that provide abundant data for transmission, loss is usually handled satisfactorily, even if the application is latency-sensitive [26]. For data streams where small packets are sent intermittently, however, applications can occasionally experience extreme latencies [14]. As {{it is not uncommon}} that such thin-stream applications are time-dependent, any unnecessarily induced delay can have severe consequences for the service provided. It has been shown that TCP has several shortcomings with respect to the latency requirements of thin streams because of the way it handles retransmissions [14]. As such, an alternative to TCP may be SCTP [25], which was developed to meet the requirements of <b>signalling</b> <b>transport.</b> SCTP has subsequently been considered more appropriate than TCP for congestion-controlled streaming, primarily because SCTP maintains packetboundaries and intrinsically supports partial reliability. In this paper, we evaluate the Linux-kernel SCTP implementation in the context of thin streams. To address the identified latency challenges, we propose sender-side only enhancements that reduce the application-layer latency {{in a manner that is}} compatible with unmodified receivers. These enhancements can be switched on by applications and are used only when the system identifies the stream as thin. To evaluate the latency performance, we have performed several tests over various real networks and over an emulated network, varying parameters like RTT, packet loss and amount of competing cross traffic. When comparing our modifications with SCTP on Linux and FreeBSD and TCP New Reno, our results show great latency improvements and indicate the need for a separate handling of thin and thick streams. ...|$|E

Blossoms of a fire blight-susceptible apple cultivar Gala were collected from trees growing in the orchard, placed on a tray in the laboratory, and spray-inoculated with a suspension of E. amylovora at a concentration of 108 cfu ml− 1. Uninoculated detached flowers served as controls at each time point. Expression profiles were captured at three different time points post-inoculation at 2, 8, and 24 h, together with those at 0 h (uninoculated). A total of about 3500 genes were found to be significantly modulated in response to {{at least one of the}} three time points. Among those, a total of 770, 855, and 1002 genes were up-regulated, by 2 -fold, at 2, 8, and 24 h following inoculation, respectively; while, 748, 1024, and 1455 genes were down-regulated, by 2 -fold, at 2, 8, and 24 h following inoculation, respectively. Over the three time points post-inoculation, 365 genes were commonly up-regulated and 374 genes were commonly down-regulated. Both sets of genes were classified based on their functional categories.
