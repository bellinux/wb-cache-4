40|$|The Darwinian {{logic of}} {{evolution}} occurring via {{the mechanisms of}} variation, selection and retention provides a possible theoretical framework from which to further develop the dynamic capabilities view. Presently, criticized for lacking a theoretical foundation and featuring a degree of confusion concerning how it aligns with the resource-based view, the dynamic capabilities view would benefit from greater clarity concerning its assumptions, theoretical base {{and the development of}} a series of testable predictions. We test elements of a potential Darwinian style framework through variation-focused hypotheses using panel data for 190 Australian service firms. Our results highlight the importance of market development as a basis for variation, however, the impact of dynamic capabilities upon a likely antecedent of selection was not clear and highlighted a nuanced relationship between capability development, market development and sales growth in an <b>small-and-medium-sized</b> <b>enterprise</b> environment. We conclude that applying a Darwinian lens to the dynamic capabilities view is challenging without longer time series data and additional measures, but such an approach remains theoretically attractive and further investigation may help clarify how we conceptualize the relationship between the dynamic capabilities view and resource-based view.

40|$|Abstract—This {{article is}} themed {{with the study}} of the leap-forward {{development}} paths and independent innovation patterns of BYD, aimed to search for its main innovative elements and restraint factors that form various bottlenecks so as to provide the <b>small-and-medium-sized</b> private <b>enterprises</b> with experiences for leap-forward growth. Firstly, it analyzes the growth paths of BYD, and then makes comparisons between BYD's innovative modes and general corporate patterns, and applies transaction cost analytic approach to study the innovative elements like “vertical integration ” of the supply chain, “branch network channel ” of marketing strategies and the market strategy of “turning the second-tier and third-tier cities into first-tier ones”, achieving transaction cost leadership; since 2010, BYD has come across various bottlenecks, and the transaction cost of original pattern has reached a critical point. Therefore, the enterprise needs to break through the original mode, and try innovative patterns. The author has put forward {{that it is necessary to}} carry out adjustment of development strategies, proper exit of the strategy of vertical integration as well as the organization of product structure; conduct independent R&D, and master core technologies to create its own brand; engage in open innovations, while applying internal and external complementary resources to achieve further innovation, and other viewpoints.

40|$|There is {{debate over}} the {{relationship}} between ownership structure and firm performance, and most existing studies look at established listed companies in developed world where the market mechanism is well-developed. While there are many benefits to use listed companies as sample, an important part - <b>small-and-medium-sized</b> <b>enterprises</b> (SMEs) - has largely been neglected. Following endogenous ownership theory, this paper explores the impact of ownership structure on performance of SMEs {{in a context of}} under-developed market environment. Using a survey data of 189 private firms in Shantou City, China, we find the ownership variables do not have significantly impact on firm performance. We further explore the determinants of changing ownership shares indicates that firm size and business instability may lead to the change of ownership. Our findings support the central argument of endogenous ownership theory, and reveal factors that may lead to the change of ownership structure among SMEs in emerging market. ...|$|E

40|$|Although {{numerous}} {{papers have}} examined {{the ways in which}} firms can improve their innovative performance through technology alliances, empirical research on the effect of contract structures in technology licensing has been scarce. This study provides evidence that the payment mechanisms agreed upon in licensing contracts affect the licensee firms¡¯ innovative performance. Based on a dataset of technology licensing contracts concluded by small- and medium-sized enterprises around the world, this paper analyzes the influence of fixed-fee payments and ongoing payments?including royalty, milestone, and equity payments?on firm performance. The findings reveal that ongoing payments are more likely to positively influence the innovative performance of licensee firms. The results also suggest that equity grants to the licensor would not impact the licensee¡¯s performance as much as fixed-fee payments. These outcomes provide crucial insights into the ways in which small high-tech firms can utilize their external technology resources.

Underpricing is calculated using headline underpricing, underpricing issuer loss, underpricing loss by market value, and underpricing loss by issuer price. Aftermarket performance employs monthly cumulative abnormal returns, buy-and-hold returns and wealth relatives. The underpricing results show an average underpricing of 12. 69 %, 5. 01 %, 4. 74 % and 11. 40 % for the 4 measures used, respectively. This is {{significantly lower than the}} underpricing found for the large-firm IPOs listing on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET). However, there is much variability in pricing over the sample period, with substantial underpricing in 2003 / 2004 and correctly priced issues on average in 2001 / 2002 and 2005 / 2006 / 2007.

I will zoom in on this key language, which in simplistic terms is all too frequently labelled as being English, and surmise that it has turned into an asset for business communication rather than a source of misunderstanding. Although this paper is not intended to be normative, it equally commands attention with respect to language situations in the area of business, which supposedly condition didactic issues, by considering varying language and cultural features, discussed in the light of tuition policies. status: publishe...|$|E

In other words, big {{commercial bank}}s {{turned out to}} be slow to take risk responding to the impact of Internet finance, while it was not the case with small-and-medium-sized commercial banks, which showed relatively obvious reaction. There were some explanations to this end: first, nominal ownership of big commercial banks, long chain of principal agent, and implicit government guarantee as well as the expectation of “too big to fail” would weaken the restriction of budget, leading to slow reaction to market competition (Zhixian et al. 2015). Second, big commercial banks were large in system, diverse in management level, and various in personnel structure, so they were easily to have time lag in signaling and tackling crisis (Mulherin and Boone 2000). Third, big commercial banks, generally speaking, eyed for big SOEs; while small-and-medium-sized commercial banks and Internet finance always treated micro-small-and-medium-sized enterprises as their customers. Thus, Internet finance had an ever immediate impact on <b>small-and-medium-sized</b> <b>enterprises.</b> Fourth, big commercial banks were subject to strict policies of supervision as systematically important banks. According to the study of Beltratti and Stultz (2012), the tighter the supervision was, the more prudent risk-taking behaviors those economic subjects would make. Therefore, nominal ownership, large scale, fixed customer, and special status together resulted that big commercial banks’ risk taking were slow in responding Internet finance.|$|E
40|$|Purpose Drawing on {{motivation}} {{theory and}} family business literature, we investigate {{the influence of}} family effect in growth behavior of <b>small-and-medium-sized</b> <b>enterprises</b> (SMEs) in the UK. Design/methodology/approach We first compare the actual and expected growth of family and non-family-owned SMEs. We then compare the growth behaviour of small family firms managed by owner-directors and small family businesses co-managed by family and non-family directors with the non-family-owned SMEs. Findings We find a negative effect of family ownership on actual and intended small business growth behaviors. In addition, our findings also suggest that small family firms co-managed by non-family and family directors are no different from non-family owned firms, in terms of reporting past actual growth in employment size and turnover as well as expecting growth in workforce size and turnover. We also observe {{a significant difference in}} anticipating sales growth between family-controlled and non-family-controlled firms. However, this difference is not explained by the heterogeneity of a top management team. Practical implications The study has important implications for managerial practice to family firms and on policies that improve the growth of SMEs. Specifically, the competence of managers and decision-makers matters considerably in evaluating the efficient operation of the business and maximising economic growth in SMEs. Originality/value The study makes two important theoretical contributions to small business growth literature. Firstly, our findings underline a negative family effect in the actual and expected growth behaviour of SMEs.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} growth and non-growth of <b>small-and-medium-sized</b> <b>enterprises</b> (SMEs) over the long-term. A {{multiple}} case study methodology {{was used to examine}} the growth paths of eight SMEs over a period of fourteen years. Four firms represented manufacturing and four, the professional and business services industry. The firms were paired according to similar sectors and contrasting growth paths. Longitudinal employment data illustrated the firms’ growth paths, and the primary method of data collection was semi-structured interviews of the firms’ owner-managers. The research incorporated extensive literature, including traditional research approaches and life cycle models and emergent literature on organisational learning and growth paths. The growth and non-growth firms were found to be distinct from each other, regardless of industry. The growth firms’ owner-managers had strong growth ambitions and actively sought the recognition and challenges that arise from the operation of multiple growth businesses. The non-growth owner-managers had passive growth ambitions and focused on maintaining their accustomed lifestyle. These differences were also illustrated in the firms’ approaches to networking, internationalisation and technological advancement. The growth firm owner-managers were all portfolio entrepreneurs and had strong professional networks, which they considered were strategically vital. In contrast, the non-growth owner-managers were novice entrepreneurs and were nonchalant towards networking. Innovation and flexibility were identified as important characteristics in the long-term performance of the firms. Findings also indicated that owner-managers’ perceptions of their external business environment determined the influence it had on the business. Individual and collective learning processes underpin these findings in determining long-term growth performance of the firms. The strong interrelationships between owner-managers, learning processes, and longitudinal growth paths suggest areas of future research...|$|E
40|$|This {{project is}} {{concerned}} with developing an understanding of systems of regional renewal (defined as where a restructuring of regional industries or technologies takes place or where new firms or industries emerge). The framework used for the study was an adapted version of the Holmen-McKelvey analytical tool designed for the systematic study of regional renewal. This included analysing social capital, organisations, and path dependency. As the study was concerned with understanding the operation of regions which by nature are complex systems, the study made use of a qualitative case study method. Four case studies were analysed in depth, two each from Germany and Australia: Dresden, Freiberg, Adelaide, and the Barossa. The conclusions from the research are twofold. The thesis argues that the Holmen and McKelvey framework varies across regions and that that the variation {{can be explained by}} the ‘varieties of capitalism’ literature. That is, regional renewal systems work differently in different regions because regions are part of a national political-institutional context (or variety of capitalism). First, the paths to regional renewal vary across regions. There are many and varied contributing factors to regional renewal and a holistic approach is needed in analysing the sources of regional renewal as well as in formulating regional policy. Social capital and path dependency in particular were important across all four cases, suggesting that social capital can enable the mobilisation of regional attributes and that historical and context specific aspects of a region need to be considered in regional direction setting. While some contribution by these factors was consistent across all four cases, their apparent strength and the nature of their contributions varied. The roles of universities, government bodies, multinational corporations, <b>small-and-medium-sized</b> <b>enterprises,</b> technology parks, non-university research bodies, and industry associations displayed even more variation amongst the cases suggesting that there can be no ‘cut and paste’ or one-size-fits-all approach to regional renewal. Before policy is formulated and implemented, there needs to be a systemic analysis of regional assets and deficiencies. Second, the thesis suggests that renewal systems work differently in different regions because regions are part of a national political-institutional context. Different paths to regional renewal can be explained in terms of different institutional capacities for state-led coordination and governance of the regional institutional environment. The thesis puts forward the proposition that we might expect national structures to impact on the functioning of systems of regional renewal. The case analysis suggests that we might expect coordinated attempts at regional renewal involving several actors to be more successful in coordinated market economies than in uncoordinated market economies. The four cases in this research indicate the national business system impacts on the local level. Five key differences between the German and Australian cases were: the approach of the state at a regional level, social capital, the education and training system, policy continuity, and multinational embeddedness. National policies provide a critical role of strategic planning at the local level. How can an uncoordinated market environment at the national level which includes a focus on competition and anti-trust facilitate cooperation between firms and other actors at the local level which is seen as critical for coordinated attempts at regional renewal? Thus a key lesson from this research is that to achieve regional renewal, different regions require locally appropriate policies supported by national directions...|$|E
40|$|Professional {{sports teams}} {{according}} to Madura (1982) possess very similar Human Resource Management (HRM) characteristics {{to those on}} display in many other business entities, especially those located in the <b>small-and-medium-sized</b> <b>enterprises</b> (SMEs) sector. Research investigating the HRM processes of Professional Sports Organisation (PSOs) has predominately focused on player recruitment systems, with little attention being given to the degree which sports organisations apply established workplace HRM selection processes to athlete selection procedures (Bradbury & Forsyth, 2012). Other aspects of the HRM framework (e. g. orientation and socialisation, training and development, and retention) have, to date, largely been ignored from a sport management perspective. The football-related literature in this area, for example, is dominated by examples of labour migration, which is heavily influenced by World System Theory (Magee & Sugden, 2002). While further suggesting that football players {{are nothing more than}} commodities which can be sold or traded resulting in either a net profit or loss (Maguire, 1999). European clubs at the core of world football dominate the transfer market and acquire the best talent. The financial muscle of these particular clubs along with other “push” and “pull” factors has led to a global migration of playing talent, as players now of all ages seek new opportunities to continue plying their trade. To date, current sports migration literature has neglected the connection between player migration and organisational HRM practices, a connection that needs to be established given that a PSO’s success significantly relies on their ability to arrange their playing resources into a collective group, a process that has the potential to generate a competitive advantage. Currently, player registration periods in professional football are a hive of activity, as players and their agents seek new opportunities to advance or prolong their athletic careers, while the clubs utilise these periods to restructure their own human resource portfolios, to satisfy the needs and wants of their key stakeholders (fans, sponsors and financial investors). Traditionally, football clubs recruited players from their own local community, but with the diffusion of the “global game” clubs are increasingly looking further afield to uncover new playing talent, searches that typically occur across the following three distinct levels; (1) between clubs competing within the same competition in the same country, (2) between clubs competing in different competitions in the same country, and (3) clubs competing in different leagues in different countries. This thesis adopts the traditional HRM framework provided by Hoye, Nicholson, Smith, Stewart, and Westerbeck (2012) to identify and analyse the recruitment and retention processes employed by football franchises in Australasia’s only full-time professional league (the A-League). The interpretive investigation was completed via an abductive mixed-method case study approach, where data was collected in two consecutive but distinct phases. Statistical data related to player recruitment and retention was collected, revealing the average age for a local player entering the league (23 years) was noticeably different to the average age of a European player (30 years old) and that, on average, these foreign imports – most of whom were found to be attack-minded players – spent less than two years playing in the competition. These findings were used as a platform (i. e. conversation-starter) to complete eight semi-structured interviews with purposefully targeted individuals involved in contract negotiation proceedings. To ensure information was gathered that presented the perspectives of both sides interviews were completed with both franchise CEOs and player agents. Concepts identified during these discussions were refined to explain why the A-League HRM processes surrounding recruitment and retention of football players has evolved in such a manner, while also allowing an “A-League specific” HRM model to be developed. Overall, it was concluded that A-league HRM processes are vastly determined by aspects associated with relationships, responsibility, and reputations. The identification of these three key factors allowed recommendations to be generated to allow all current and any future A-league franchises the opportunity to develop more sustainable HRM strategies, such as developing a formal induction program for all new players. Other recommendations for future research are also presented...|$|E
