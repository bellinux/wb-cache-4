40|$|Cement paste {{shrinkage}} {{and influence}} of the <b>shrink-resistant</b> additive Estrifan Additive RCL on this process were studied, both when the latter one was used independently, and in a combination with the superplasticizer Muraplast FK 48, and powdery fillers - fly ash and silica fume Reftinskaya TPP ISU- 85. It has been revealed that cement shrinkage {{in the presence of}} this additive is reduced regardless of {{the presence or absence of}} mineral microfillers. Moreover, these fillers have no impact on shrinkage. When the content of additives is more than 2...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{influence}} of a <b>shrink-resistant</b> “Estrifan Additive RCL ” additives on the cement paste shrinkage was researched. The cement paste shrinkage is reduced when we use this additive. When the content of additives is more than 2 % there is expansion in the initial stage of hardening. The extension period is longer {{and the value of}} expansion deformation is higher, the additive dosage is higher. The presence of superplasticizer Muraplast FК 48 enhances the initial expansion effect and shrinkage decrease by reducing the rate of evaporation of water. On the contrary, in a separate action superplasticizer increases the cement paste shrinkage...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In the paper, wool {{samples were}} pretreated by [Bmim]Cl ionic liquid, {{followed}} by protease. The effect of ionic liquid pretreatment on the enzymatic <b>shrink-resistant</b> finishing of wool fabrics was studied. The {{results showed that}} the epicuticle was damaged by pretreatment, and the wettability of wool fabric was improved. These changes of wool surface made a promotional effect on proteolytic reactions. They could remarkably improve the accessibility of protease and thus increasing the efficiency of protease treatment. The weight loss of the sample pretreated with ionic liquid was dramatically increased, and the encouraging shrink-resistance was also achieved after the combination of ionic liquid and protease treatments. ...|$|E

Enzymes {{have been widely used}} in the textile wet processing. The precise reaction specificity of an enzyme has been utilised for specific or targeted textile finishing without causing undesirable fibre damage. Laccases are important enzymes for their application in textile processing due to their great versatility and capability of catalysing the oxidation of a broad range of substrates. The investigation of laccase-catalysed coloration towards either wool or polyethylenimine was carried out. It is understood that amino groups from wool and polyethylenimine are involved in the formation of polymeric colour during laccase catalysation of catechin and gallic acid. The colour depth and shrink-resistance of wool can be improved significantly by incorporating a multi-primary amine compound, such as polyethylenimine, and a crosslinking agent, such as glycerol diglycidyl ether, in the enzymatic coloration process of wool. This demonstrated the potential to achieve combined coloration and <b>shrink-resistant</b> finishing for wool fabrics...|$|E
