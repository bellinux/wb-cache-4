40|$|We {{have studied}} numerically the {{diffraction}} of a surface plasmon polariton (SPP) when it encounters a wide multi-wavelength slit in conducting films. As a jump process a SPP is excited beyond the slit by wave scattering {{at the second}} <b>slit</b> <b>edge.</b> The exciting radiation is produced when the incident SPP collapses at the first <b>slit</b> <b>edge.</b> We {{have found that the}} transmitted SPP supports inherent and unavoidable interference with grazing scattered radiation; the spatial modulation extends to the fields in the diffraction region where a series of low intensity spots arises. We demonstrate that the SPP generated on the second slab depends on the frequency but not on the wave vector of the collapsed SPP; a SPP is transmitted even when the two metals forming the slit are different.

We present a flat Gauss illumination for the step-and-scan lithographic system in this paper. Through flat Gauss illumination in scanning direction, pulse quantization effect could be reduced effectively. Correspondingly, the uniformity of the reticle and wafer is improved. Compared with the trapezoid illumination, flat Gauss illumination could keep the <b>slit</b> <b>edge</b> fixed, and pulse quantization effect will not be enhanced. Moreover flat Gauss illumination could be obtained directly without defocusing and blocking, which results in high energy efficiency and high throughput of the lithography. A design strategy for flat Gauss illumination is also proposed which offers high uniformity illumination, fixed slope and integral energy of flat Gauss illumination in different coherence factors. The strategy describes a light uniform device which contains first microlens array, second microlens array, one-dimensional Gauss diffuser and a Fourier lens. The device produces flat Gauss illumination directly at the scanning slit. The design and simulation {{results show that the}} uniformity of flat Gauss illumination in two directions satisfy the requirements of lithographic illumination system and the slope.

It is performed toward image based ranging techniques. There are two main image ranging techniques. The first one, which is named active projector ranging technique, uses a single camera and high focusing projector. The second approach (which is called passive projector) is based on finding correspondence between stereo images taken from same object surface. Both the techniques use a light projector which projects a structured light pattern. In this study, a color slits pattern have been designed to uniquely labeling and precisely extracting the image points along <b>slits</b> <b>edges.</b> The label of any image point is assigned according to hue value of next and previous <b>slits.</b> <b>Edge</b> points of <b>slits</b> are extracted along the epipolar lines of stereo images and labeled simultaneously.

40|$|We present flame, a {{pipeline}} for reducing spectroscopic observations obtained with multi-slit near-infrared and optical instruments. Because of its flexible design, flame {{can be easily}} applied to data obtained {{with a wide variety}} of spectrographs. The flexibility is due to a modular architecture, which allows changes and customizations to the pipeline, and relegates the instrument-specific parts to a single module. At the core of the data reduction is the transformation from observed pixel coordinates (x, y) to rectified coordinates (lambda, gamma). This transformation consists in the polynomial functions lambda(x,y) and gamma(x,y) that are derived from arc or sky emission lines and <b>slit</b> <b>edge</b> tracing, respectively. The use of 2 D transformations allows one to wavelength-calibrate and rectify the data using just one interpolation step. Furthermore, the gamma(x,y) transformation includes also the spatial misalignment between frames, which can be measured from a reference star observed simultaneously with the science targets. The misalignment can then be fully corrected during the rectification, without having to further resample the data. Sky subtraction can be performed via nodding and/or modeling of the sky spectrum; the combination of the two methods typically yields the best results. We illustrate the pipeline by showing examples of data reduction for a near-infrared instrument (LUCI at the Large Binocular Telescope) and an optical one (LRIS at the Keck telescope).

40|$|Transport {{of solid}} {{particles}} in a slit virtual impactor has been analyzed using visualization techniques. Particle trajectories were observed using laser-induced fluorescence of monodisperse particles seeded {{in the virtual}} impactor flow. It was observed from these trajectories that for smaller inertia particles essentially followed the flow streamlines, whereas higher inertia particles tend to deflect from their initial streamlines. These transport characteristics {{were used to determine}} particle collection efficiency curves, and the percentage of defect particle transmission, particles transmitted to the major flow that are well beyond the experimentally determined 50 % cutoff. Defect percentages were found to be in good agreement with those based on a local stokes number approach, an analytical model using a converging flow velocity profile. It was hypothesized that these defects occur by virtue of larger particles passing through the near wall flow region and consequently transported to the major flow. The trajectories of such defect occurrences clearly show that these particles originated in the near wall region. Performance at higher mass loadings was evaluated using a background dust matrix generated by a turntable aerosol generator. At high mass loadings, clogging of the slit led to the deterioration of the impactor's performance. The time taken to clog the silt was estimated by modeling the <b>slit</b> <b>edge</b> as a single filter fiber of rectangular cross section with the primary mechanism of filtration being interception and was found to be in good agreement with the experimental data.

40|$|INTRODUCTION In the {{original}} CTS design [1] the 2. 8 mm-wide slit, joining the cylindrical beam chamber to the teeth-loaded rectangular waveguides provided a sufficient coupling for the 160 nC drive-beam bunches to deposit 40 MW of 30 GHz {{power in the}} waveguides.

In order {{to cope with the}} reduced beam intensity while maintaining the correct power output level, the CTS design has been modified to increase the beam coupling parameter. Moreover, the new CLIC Test Facility (CTF 2) requires transfer structures with even higher beam coupling because of the reduced bunch frequency (3 GHz) [3].

40|$|Abstract — The {{slitting}} of wide Y-Ba-Cu-O coated-conductor {{tapes to}} a desirable width for applications allows a considerable reduction in conductor manufacturing cost. Localized damage induced at the <b>slit</b> <b>edges</b> may be tolerated provided that mechanical cracks {{formed in the}} ceramic layers do not propagate deeper inside the conductor due to mechanical forces and thermal cycling that the strand will be subjected to in actual applications. In order to evaluate the effect of slitting, we used fatigue cycling under transverse compressive stress. These tests simulate conditions in applications such as rotating machinery and industrial magnets. Conductors measured had a rolling-assisted biaxially textured Ni-W substrate (RABiTS), or a Hastalloy-C substrate with an ion-beam assisted deposition (IBAD) buffer template. Samples were fabricated {{with or without a}} Cu protection layer. Furthermore, specimen with the protection layer had Cu added either before or after slitting. For all these geometries, the critical-current exhibited no significant degradation during fatigue testing up to 150 MPa transverse compressive stress and 20, 000 cycles. Nevertheless, the results obtained do not guarantee that slitting is harmless to the conductor performance under all experimental conditions.

5000|$|Diffraction {{can be a}} {{major cause}} of crosstalk. [...] Theoretical {{simulations}} of diffraction {{have been found to be}} a good predictor of experimental crosstalk measurements in emulsion parallax barrier systems. These simulations predict that the amount of crosstalk caused by the parallax barrier will be highly dependent on the sharpness of the <b>edges</b> of the <b>slits.</b> For example, if the transmission of the barrier goes from opaque to transparent sharply as it moves from barrier to slit then this produces a wide diffraction pattern and consequently more crosstalk. If the transition is smoother then the diffraction will not spread so widely and less crosstalk will be produced.This prediction is consistent with experimental results for a slightly soft-edged barrier (whose pitch was 182 micrometers, slit width was 48 micrometers, and transition between opaque and transmissive occurred over a region of about 3 micrometers). The slightly soft-edged barrier has a crosstalk of 2.3%, which is slightly lower than the crosstalk from a harder-edged barrier which was about 2.7%. The diffraction simulations also suggest that if the parallax barrier <b>slit</b> <b>edges</b> had a transmission that decreases over a 10 micrometers region, then crosstalk could become as 0.1.Image processing is an alternative crosstalk countermeasure. The figure shows the principle behind crosstalk correction.|$|R

Materials and Methods: The procedure involves mobilization of strictured urethra and laying it open with a dorsal <b>slit.</b> <b>Edges</b> of the slit-open urethra are sutured to edges of the urethral groove to the tunica of corporal bodies with catheter in situ. Results were assessed postoperatively 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.

All patients were taken for post-operative urethroscopic analysis at 6 months to allow better understanding of both successful and failed cases. Results: Mean follow-up of 15. 2 (11 - 19) months showed an 80 % success rate. Mean uroflow rate showed Qmax 24. 5 cc/sec with 8 cases showing no residual or recurrent stricture.

40|$|AbstractCellular {{materials}} have two important properties: structures and mechanisms. These properties have important applications in materials design; in particular, {{they are used}} to determine the modulus and yield strain. The objective {{of this study is to}} gain a better understanding of these two properties and to explore the synthesis of compliant cellular materials (CCMs) with compliant porous structures (CPSes) generated from modified hexagonal honeycombs. An in-plane constitutive CCM model is constructed using the strain energy method, which uses the deformation of hinges around holes and the rotation of links. A finite element (FE) based simulation is conducted to validate the analytical model. The moduli and yield strains of the CCMs with an aluminum alloy are about 5. 8 GPa and 0. 57 % in one direction and about 2. 9 MPa and 20 % in the other direction. CCMs have extremely high positive and negative Poisson’s ratios (νxy∗∼± 40) due to the large rotation of the link member in the transverse direction caused by an input displacement in the longitudinal direction. CCMs also show higher moduli after contact of <b>slit</b> <b>edges</b> at the center region of the CPSes. The synthesized CPSes can also be used to design a new CCM with a Poisson’s ratio of zero using a puzzle-piece CPS assembly.

40|$|Diffraction {{patterns}} of electrons {{are believed to}} resemble those of electromagnetic waves (EMW). I performed a series of experiments invoked {{to show that the}} periodicity of peaks in the diffraction diagram of electrons is concerned with the periodicity of the arrangement of scattering centers in the diffraction grating in combination with the supposed character of the spatial structure of the electron as a system of regularly spaced concentric shells of elasticity. I started from the experiment on the diffraction of electrons and EMWs at the sharp edge of the opaque half-plane. This simple scattering configuration enabled me to discriminate between the re-radiation mechanism of the wave diffraction and ricochet scattering of electrons {{on the edge of the}} half-plane. Then I made experiments with scattering on composite objects proceeding step by step from a single straight edge to a couple of <b>edges</b> (one <b>slit)</b> and then to four <b>edges</b> (two <b>slits).</b> Thus I succeeded in interpretation of the double-slit diffraction (four straight edges) in terms of the scattering on a single edge. I managed also to observe the electron's trajectory. Equipping the <b>slit's</b> <b>edge</b> with a semiconductor sensors I registered the passing of the electron through the slit detecting simultaneously a weaker signal at another slit. This technique appeared not to destroy or disturb the "interference" pattern. Closing one slit by inserting therein a transparent for EMWs piece of dielectric I have found that the scattering pattern beneath this slit vanishes while the scattering pattern under the open slit remains as before when both slits were open. This experiment indicates that the electron "interferes" with its electromagnetic component passed via the slit plugged by the transparent for it dielectric. Comment: 13 pages, 11 figure...|$|R
