40|$|Key words：Countdown method, {{frequency}} measuring, synchronous counter, monostable trigger Abstract. After down-conversion and shaping, {{the transmission}} pulse signal of radar turns to intermediate frequency TTL square signal. This signal, {{on the basis}} of the frequency measuring principle of countdown counter, is counted by three pieces cascading of <b>binary</b> <b>synchronous</b> <b>counter</b> 74 LS 161. Three hundred pulses of the signal are chosen to form the counting section, in which the 100 MHz standard square wave is counted by 74 F 161 with three pieces cascading. Then the result is loaded into MCU. The MCU works out current IF-RE and controls the DDS local frequency synthesizer to adjust the local output, in order that the frequency of IF signal is stabilized in the specified scope. The digital automatic frequency control system of radar is constituted. Integrated circuit TTL has the longest history and highest production at home and abroad. Its inherent structural features, good electrical property, constant constitutional improvement and performance improvement help the “aged ” TTL circuit maintain its popularity after several changes[1]. The integrated circuit TTL possesses high reliability, broad range of operating speed, low power dissipation and favorable antijamming capability.

40|$|We {{present a}} model of near-Earth {{asteroid}} (NEA) rotational fission and ensuing dynamics that describes the creation of <b>synchronous</b> <b>binaries</b> and all other observed NEA systems including: doubly <b>synchronous</b> <b>binaries,</b> high- e binaries, ternary systems, and contact binaries. Our model only presupposes the Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect, "rubble pile" asteroid geophysics, and gravitational interactions. The YORP effect torques a "rubble pile" asteroid until the asteroid reaches its fission spin limit and the components enter orbit about each other (Scheeres, D. J. [2007]. Icarus 189, 370 - 385). Non-spherical gravitational potentials couple the spin states to the orbit state and chaotically drive the system towards the observed asteroid classes along two evolutionary tracks primarily distinguished by mass ratio. Related to {{this is a new}} binary process termed secondary fission - the secondary asteroid of the binary system is rotationally accelerated via gravitational torques until it fissions, thus creating a chaotic ternary system. The initially chaotic binary can be stabilized to create a <b>synchronous</b> <b>binary</b> by components of the fissioned secondary asteroid impacting the primary asteroid, solar gravitational perturbations, and mutual body tides. These results emphasize the importance of the initial component size distribution and configuration within the parent asteroid. NEAs may go through multiple binary cycles and many YORP-induced rotational fissions during their approximately 10 Myr lifetime in the inner Solar System. Rotational fission and the ensuing dynamics are responsible for all NEA systems including the most commonly observed <b>synchronous</b> <b>binaries.</b> Comment: 39 pages, 19 figure...|$|R
50|$|High {{clock rates}} impose {{additional}} design {{constraints on the}} counter: if the clock period is short, {{it is difficult to}} update the count. <b>Binary</b> <b>counters,</b> for example, need a fast carry architecture because they essentially add one to the previous counter value. A solution is using a hybrid counter architecture. A Johnson counter, for example, is a fast non-binary counter. It can be used to count very quickly the low order count; a more conventional <b>binary</b> <b>counter</b> can be used to accumulate the high order count. The fast counter is sometime called a prescaler.|$|R

All of the Boolean functions {{can be implemented}} using reversible gates. In this paper, we propose a reversible 4 -Bit <b>binary</b> <b>counter</b> with parallel load. It has minimum complexity and quantum cost considerably. The proposed circuit is the first attempt of designing a 4 -Bit <b>binary</b> <b>counter</b> with parallel load. Counter is essentially a register that goes through a predetermined sequence of states. The reversible gates in the counter are connected {{in such a way}} as to produce the prescribed sequence of <b>binary</b> states. This <b>counter</b> receives a 4 -Bit data from input and delivers data to D Flip Flop in next cycle. Loading data from input is determined with Load property. The important reversible gates used for our reversible logic synthesis are Feynman gate, Peres gate and Fredkin gate. The proposed circuit becomes a robust design by our optimal method and using these gates. The proposed circuit has minimum number of the garbage outputs and constant inputs in reversible circuit.

40|$|Abstract: Reversible {{logic is}} one of the ways for power optimization. The {{produced}} circuits using these gates are applied in nanotechnology, bioinformatics, quantum computing and DNA. In this paper, we propose a fault tolerant reversible 4 -Bit <b>binary</b> <b>counter</b> with parallel load. This is a robust and first attempt for designing a fault tolerant reversible 4 -Bit <b>binary</b> <b>counter</b> with parallel load. Counters are important components in computers. Most counters are synchronous in computer systems. Some of these counters can also be made from D-Flip Flops. Counters can be designed to generate any desired sequence of states. The sequence may follow the binary count or may be any other arbitrary sequence. In this study, we propose three approaches of the fault tolerant reversible circuits for 4 -Bit <b>binary</b> <b>counter</b> with parallel load. Total logical calculation and Total quantum cost of the second approach is less than the previous approaches. Third approach is implemented using Unit 3 gate. The constant inputs and the garbage outputs of its circuit is less than the mentioned approaches. All the scales are in the nanometric area. The proposed circuits can be applied for constructing more complex systems in nanotechnology...|$|R
