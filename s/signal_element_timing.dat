40|$|SummarySex is {{determined}} in C. elegans by a chromosome-counting mechanism that tallies X chromosome dose {{relative to the}} sets of autosomes, the X:A ratio. A group of genes on X called X <b>signal</b> <b>elements</b> (XSEs) communicates X chromosome number by repressing {{the activity of the}} master sex-determination switch gene xol- 1 in a dose-dependent manner. xol- 1 is repressed by transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms and is inactive in XX animals (hermaphrodite) but active in XO animals (male). Prior to our work, the nature of the autosomal signal and its target(s) were unknown. Here we show the signal includes discrete, trans-acting autosomal <b>signal</b> <b>elements</b> (ASEs) that counter XSEs to coordinately control both sex determination and dosage compensation. sea- 1, the first autosomal <b>signal</b> <b>element,</b> encodes a T-box transcription factor that opposes XSEs by activating transcription of xol- 1.

40|$|An X {{chromosome}} counting process determines sex in Caenorhabditis elegans. The dose of X chromosomes is {{translated into}} sexual fate {{by a set}} of X-linked genes that together control the activity of the sex-determination and dosage-compensation switch gene, xol- 1. The double dose of X elements in XX animals represses xol- 1 expression, promoting the hermaphrodite fate, while the single dose of X elements in XO animals permits high xol- 1 expression, promoting the male fate. Previous work has revealed at least four <b>signal</b> <b>elements</b> that repress xol- 1 expression at two levels, transcriptional and post-transcriptional. The two molecularly characterized elements include an RNA binding protein and a nuclear hormone receptor homolog. Here we explore the roles of the two mechanisms of xol- 1 repression and further investigate how the combined dose of X <b>signal</b> <b>elements</b> ensures correct, sex-specific expression of xol- 1. By studying the effects of increases and decreases in X <b>signal</b> <b>element</b> dose on male and hermaphrodite fate, we demonstrate that <b>signal</b> <b>elements</b> repress xol- 1 cumulatively, such that full repression of xol- 1 in XX animals results from the combined effect of individual elements. Complete transformation from the hermaphrodite to the male fate requires a decrease in the dose of all four elements, from two copies to one. We show that both mechanisms of xol- 1 repression are essential and act synergistically to keep xol- 1 levels low in XX animals. However, increasing repression by one mechanism can compensate for loss of the other, demonstrating that each mechanism can exert significant xol- 1 repression on its own. Finally, we present evidence suggesting that xol- 1 activity can be set at intermediate levels in response to an intermediate X signal...|$|R

Identification of <b>signaling</b> <b>elements</b> downstream of COX inhibition, particularly of PG receptor subtypes responsible for pain sensitization (hyperalgesia), provides a strategy for better-tolerated analgesics. Here, we have identified PGE 2 receptors of the EP 2 receptor subtype as key <b>signaling</b> <b>elements</b> in spinal inflammatory hyperalgesia. Mice deficient in EP 2 receptors (EP 2 -/- mice) completely lack spinal PGE 2 -evoked hyperalgesia. After a peripheral inflammatory stimulus, EP 2 -/- mice exhibit only short-lasting peripheral hyperalgesia but lack a second sustained hyperalgesic phase of spinal origin. Electrophysiological recordings identify diminished synaptic inhibition of excitatory dorsal horn neurons as the dominant source of EP 2 receptor-dependent hyperalgesia.

A proportion {{of these elements}} had a coherent orientation (horizontal/vertical) with the remainder assigned random orientations. The observer's task was to identify the global orientation. The spatial configuration of the signal was modulated by a checkerboard pattern of square checks containing potential <b>signal</b> <b>elements.</b> The other locations contained either randomly oriented elements (''noise check'') or were blank (''blank check''). The distribution of <b>signal</b> <b>elements</b> was manipulated by varying the size and location of the checks within a fixed-diameter stimulus.

For small check sizes, however, the pooling occurred indiscriminately over relevant and irrelevant locations. For these check sizes, thresholds for the noise check and blank check conditions were similar, suggesting that the limiting noise is not induced by {{the response to the}} noise elements. The results are described by a model that filters the stimulus at the potential target orientations and then combines the signals over space in two stages.

Based on the mutant phenotypes of genes that are controlled by the signal, we expected that increases (in males) or decreases (in hermaphrodites) in the dose of X chromosome elements could cause sex-specific lethality. We isolated duplications and deficiencies of specific X chromosome regions, using strategies that would permit their recovery regardless of whether they affect the signal.

The hermaphrodite defects are suppressed by a downstream mutation that forces all animals into the XX mode of sex determination and dosage compensation. The male lethality is suppressed by mutations that force all animals into the XO mode of both processes.
