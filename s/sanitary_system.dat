60|$|He saw the architect: and then, {{with his}} plans and schemes, {{he saw the}} builder and contractor. The builder gave an {{estimate}} of six or seven hundred--but James had better see the plumber and fitter {{who was going to}} instal the new hot water and <b>sanitary</b> <b>system.</b> James was a little dashed. He had calculated much less. Having only a few hundred pounds in possession after Throttle-Ha'penny, he was prepared to mortgage Manchester House if he could keep in hand a sufficent sum of money for the running of his establishment for a year. He knew he would have to sacrifice Miss Pinnegar's work-room. He knew, and he feared Miss Pinnegar's violent and unmitigated hostility. Still--his obstinate spirit rose--he was quite prepared to risk everything on this last throw.|$|E

He established the Bir Library for the collection and preservation of valuable books and manuscripts, the postal system was reformed and many roads of Kathmandu were broadened.|$|E
50|$|The Santa Lucia River, {{the body}} of water that {{provides}} over 60% of Uruguayans with their tap water, has experienced a significant decline in quality since 2014. Increased dumping from agricultural companies into the <b>sanitary</b> <b>system</b> raised the amount of toxic waste in the water, and the decrease in rain does not allow the dilution of this waste to occur. Excessive amounts of fertilizers, the dumping of cesspit waste and wastewater treatment plants working to only half of their capacity are also large factors in the pollution of this basin.|$|E

50|$|Around 2007, a new {{hotel was}} built, {{under the name}} Palacio de Sal, in a new {{location}} at {{the eastern edge of}} Salar de Uyuni, 25 km away from the town of Uyuni. The site is 350 km south of Bolivia's capital La Paz. The building was constructed of about 1 million 35-cm (14-inch) salt blocks, which are used for the floor, walls, ceiling and furniture, including beds, tables, chairs and sculptures. The <b>sanitary</b> <b>system</b> has been restructured to comply with the government regulations. The hotel has a dry sauna and a steam room, a saltwater pool and whirlpool baths.|$|E
50|$|The {{site was}} {{purchased}} by Pigott and Co in 1914 and extensive additions by J Marks and Son were commenced. Three floors, connected by electric elevator, were added by contractor A Mayes to the southern {{side of the building}} enabling, on the ground floor, the extension of the manchester and dress departments, general office, and mail order department. The first floor contained the furniture department and tailoring and dress making work rooms; the smaller second floor was used as a bulk store room. A pneumatic cash cashier system, reputedly the first in Australia, and a complete <b>sanitary</b> <b>system</b> were installed.|$|E

40|$|The WHO Consensus Document on the {{epidemiology}} of the SARS {{epidemic in}} 2003, included {{a report on}} a concentrated outbreak in one Hong Kong housing block which was considered a 'super-spreading event'. The WHO report conjectured that the <b>sanitary</b> plumbing <b>system</b> was one transmission route for the virus. Empty U-traps allowed the aerosolised virus to enter households from the sewerage system. No biological evidence was presented. This research reports evidence that pathogens can be aerosolised and transported on airstreams within <b>sanitary</b> plumbing <b>systems</b> and enter buildings via empty U-traps. A <b>sanitary</b> plumbing <b>system</b> was built, representing two floors of a building, with simulated toilet flushes on the lower floor and a sterile chamber with extractor fan on the floor above. Cultures of a model organism, Pseudomonas putida at 106 - 109 cfu ml- 1 in 0 · 85 % NaCl were flushed into the system in volumes of 6 to 20 litres to represent single or multiple toilet flushes. Air and surface samples were cultured on agar plates and assessed qualitatively and semi-quantitatively. Flushing from a toilet into a <b>sanitary</b> plumbing <b>system</b> generated enough turbulence to aerosolise pathogens. Typical <b>sanitary</b> plumbing <b>system</b> airflows (between 20 - 30 ls- 1) were sufficient to carry aerosolised pathogens between different floors of a building. Empty U-traps allowed aerosolised pathogens to enter the chamber, encouraging cross-transmission. All parts of the system {{were found to be}} contaminated post-flush. Empty U-traps have been observed in many buildings and a risk assessment indicates the potential for high risk cross-transmission under defect conditions in buildings with high pathogen loading such as hospitals. Under defective conditions (which are not uncommon) aerosolised pathogens can be carried on the airflows within <b>sanitary</b> plumbing <b>systems.</b> Our findings show that greater consideration should be given to this mode of pathogen transmission...|$|R
