5|$|That man's a great director. He {{can make}} people feel {{perfectly}} natural. He's got what Chaplin did when he directed A Woman of Paris—he and Lewis Milestone and Mal St. Clair all have that same touch, they all belong to the new school of directors, it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> They're not so busy thinking about technique that they have actors turning into marionettes.|$|E
5|$|I am {{at first}} {{inclined}} to agree... But on re-reading the whole Ode, this line {{strikes me as}} a serious blemish on a beautiful poem, and the reason must be either that I fail to understand it, or that it is a statement which is untrue. And I suppose that Keats meant something by it, however remote his truth and his beauty may have been from these words in ordinary use. And I am sure that he would have repudiated any explanation of the line which called it a pseudo-statement... The statement of Keats <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> meaningless: or perhaps {{the fact that it is}} grammatically meaningless conceals another meaning from me.|$|E
5|$|The {{performance}} of Rebecca <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{to have taken}} us further into the danger area instead of showing any improvement. I am unable to defend {{at a time when}} departmental costs and scene loads are in an acute state the load imposed by Rebecca on Design and Supply and the expenditure upon extras and costumes... the vast area of the hall and the stairway never justified the great expenditure of effort required in building and one is left with a very clear impression of reaching a point where the department must be accused of not knowing what it is doing.|$|E
60|$|It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that George harped {{too much}} on the getting-upset idea. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> the wrong spirit to go about the trip in.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Felix, [...] "I {{confess that}} rather strikes <b>me.</b> You don't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{get all the}} {{pleasure}} out of life that you might. You don't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> enjoy..... Do you mind my saying this?" [...] he asked, pausing.|$|R
60|$|At least, so it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> {{the first}} day that I went, awe struck, into the High Woods; and so it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> the last day that I came, even more awe-struck, out of them.|$|R
5|$|The {{success of}} the {{experiment}} <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to render the adoption of Fresnel's hypothesis necessary, {{or at least the}} law which he found for the expression of the alteration of the velocity of light by the effect of motion of a body; for although that law being found true may be a very strong proof in favour of the hypothesis of which it is only a consequence, perhaps the conception of Fresnel may appear so extraordinary, and in some respects so difficult, to admit, that other proofs and a profound examination on the part of geometricians will still be necessary before adopting it as an expression of the real facts of the case.|$|E
5|$|This is not {{the place}} to pass judgements, but perhaps I may say that, as it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> both the monks and Tischendorf deserve our deepest gratitude, Tischendorf for having alerted the monks to the {{importance}} of the manuscript, and the monks for having undertaken the daunting task of searching through the vast mass of material with such spectacular results, and then doing everything in their power to safeguard the manuscript against further loss. If we accept the statement of Uspensky, that he saw the codex in 1845, the monks must have worked very hard to complete their search and bind up the results in so short a period.|$|E
5|$|To begin with, {{every one}} must buy this {{book for the}} {{following}} aesthetic reasons: First, because I know where there is the cutest cloth of gold dress for only $300 in a store on Forty-second Street, and, also, if enough people buy it {{where there is a}} platinum ring with a complete circlet, and, also, if loads of people buy it my husband needs a new winter overcoat, although the one he has done well enough for the last three years... It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that on one page I recognized a portion of an old diary of mine which mysteriously disappeared shortly after my marriage, and, also, scraps of letters which, though considerably edited, sound to me vaguely familiar. In fact, Mr. Fitzgerald—I believe that is how he spells his name—seems to believe that plagiarism begins at home.|$|E

[...] "When you entered the room a few seconds ago, it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that a miracle had happened. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that the dead had come to life." ...|$|R

5|$|In {{this book}} I {{maintained}} that a sphere of freedom is still desirable {{even in a}} socialist state, but this sphere has to be defined afresh and not in liberal terms. This doctrine I still hold. The thesis of this book <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> important, and I hoped that it would attract more attention than it has done. It {{was intended as a}} refutation both of Marx and of the classical economists, not on a point of detail, but on the fundamental assumptions that they shared. I argued that power, rather than wealth, should be the basic concept in social theory, and that social justice should consist in equalisation of power to the greatest practicable degree. It followed that State ownership of land and capital was no advance unless the State was democratic, and even then only if methods were devised for curbing the power of officials. A part of my thesis was taken up and popularised in Burnham's Managerial Revolution, but otherwise the book fell rather flat. I still hold, however, that what it has to say is of very great importance if the evils of totalitarianism are to be avoided, particularly under a Socialist régime.|$|E

25|$|I'm {{a little}} baffled {{as to why}} Stirling set this book in 1998. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that it {{requires}} more suspension of disbelief to pretend the world ended {{in the past when}} we know it didn't.|$|E
60|$|I did {{not find}} a word in the printed {{criticism}} of Synge's Deirdre of the Sorrows about the qualities that made certain moments <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> the noblest tragedy, and the play was judged by what <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> but wheels and pulleys necessary to the effect, but in themselves nothing.|$|R

25|$|The {{discovery}} of nuclear fission by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann {{opened up a}} new era in human history. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that what makes the science behind this discovery so remarkable is that it was achieved by purely chemical means.|$|E
25|$|Marxian {{economics}} <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> for {{the most}} part either false or obsolete or meaningless in application to contemporary economic phenomena. Those aspects of Marxian economics which retain validity do not seem to me to justify the theoretical structure of the economics.|$|E
25|$|Erasmus said of Colet, “When I {{listen to}} Colet it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I am {{listening}} to Plato himself.” Erasmus likely portrayed Colet {{to show that}} one could be {{highly critical of the}} Church while still a loyal priest. His depiction of Colet was partly a depiction of himself.|$|E

25|$|It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that at Netley all {{consideration}} {{of what would}} best tend to the comfort and recovery of the patients has been sacrificed to the vanity of the architect, whose sole object has been to make a building which should cut a dash when looked at from Southampton River. Pray stop all work.|$|E
25|$|The {{author of}} the 'Vestiges of Creation' would, I presume, say that, after a certain unknown number of generations, some bird {{had given birth to}} a woodpecker, and some plant to the mistletoe, and that these had been {{produced}} perfect as we now see them; but this assumption <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to be no explanation, for it leaves the case of the coadaptations of organic beings {{to each other and to}} their physical conditions of life, untouched and unexplained.|$|E
25|$|Someone {{from whom}} I feel ever more distant is Juan Gris. I admire him but I cannot {{understand}} why he wears himself out with decomposing objects. Myself, I am advancing towards synthetic unity and I don't analyze any more. I take from things what <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to have meaning and be most suitable to express my thought. I want to be direct, like Voltaire. No more metaphors. Ah those stuffed tomatoes of all the St-Pol-Roux of painting.|$|E

25|$|Many {{scholars}} {{believe the}} individual Psalms were redacted {{into a single}} collection in Second-Temple times. It had long been recognized that the collection bore the imprint of an underlying message or metanarrative, but that this message remained concealed, as Augustine of Hippo said, 'The sequence of the Psalms <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to contain the secret of a mighty mystery, but its meaning has not been revealed to me.' (Enarr. on Ps. 150.1) Others pointed out the presence of concatenation, that is, adjacent Psalms sharing similar words and themes. In time, this approach developed into recognizing overarching themes shared by whole groups of psalms.|$|E
25|$|Some {{languages}} have {{a distinct}} grammatical category of evidentiality {{that is required}} to be expressed at all times. The elements in European languages indicating the information source are optional and usually do not indicate evidentiality as their primary function — thus they do not form a grammatical category. The obligatory elements of grammatical evidentiality systems may be translated into English, variously, as I hear that, I see that, I think that, as I hear, as I can see, as far as I understand, they say, it is said, it seems, it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that, it looks like, it appears that, it turns out that, alleged, stated, allegedly, reportedly, obviously, etc.|$|E
25|$|If {{religious}} liberty includes, as it must, {{the right to}} communicate such experiences to others, it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> an impossible task for juries to separate fancied ones from real ones, dreams from happenings, and hallucinations from true clairvoyance. Such experiences, like some tones and colors, have existence for one, but none at all for another. They cannot be verified to {{the minds of those}} whose field of consciousness does not include religious insight. When one comes to trial which turns on any aspect of religious belief or representation, unbelievers among his judges are likely not to understand, and are almost certain not to believe, him.|$|E
