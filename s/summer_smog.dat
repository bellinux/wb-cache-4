5000|$|<b>Summer</b> <b>smog,</b> {{which is}} common in major cities such as London, Birmingham, New York City and Los Angeles, is caused by pollutants, mainly ozone, which collect in large cities, {{especially}} during the summer. It is formed when radiation from the sun causes ozone to build up in the lower atmosphere (troposphere), by combining nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds. At this point, ozone, which is protective in the upper atmosphere, can become harmful to humans, crops, other living creatures and buildings.|$|E

40|$|The {{bacterial}} mutagenicity {{of a set}} of 1993 urban particulate {{air pollution}} samples is examined using the Salmonella typhimurium TM 677 forward mutation assay. Ambient fine particulate samples were collected for 24 hr every sixth day throughout 1993 at four urban sites, including Long Beach, central Los Angeles, Azusa, and Rubidoux, California, and at an upwind background site on San Nicolas Island. Long Beach and central Los Angeles are congested urban areas where air quality is dominated by fresh emissions from air pollution sources; Azusa and Rubidoux are located farther downwind and receive transported air pollutants plus increased quantities of the products of atmospheric chemical reactions. Fine aerosol samples from Long Beach and Los Angeles show a pronounced seasonal variation in bacterial mutagenicity per cubic meter of ambient air, with maximum in the winter and a minimum in the <b>summer.</b> The downwind <b>smog</b> receptor site at Rubidoux shows peak mutagenicity (with postmitochondrial supernatant but no peak without postmitochondrial supernatant) during the September-October periods when direct transport from upwind sources can be expected. At most sites the mutagenicity per microgram of organic carbon from the aerosol is not obviously higher during the <b>summer</b> photochemical <b>smog</b> period than during the colder months. Significant spatial variation in bacterial mutagenicity is observed: mutagenicity per cubic meter of ambient air, on average, is more than an order of magnitude lower at San Nicolas Island than within the urban area. The highest mutagenicity values per microgram of organics supplied to the assay are found at the most congested urban sites at central Los Angeles and Long Beach. The highest annual average values of mutagenicity per cubic meter of air sampled occur at central Los Angeles. These findings stress the importance of proximity to sources of direct emissions of bacterial mutagens and imply that if important mutagen-forming atmospheric reactions occur, they likely occur in the winter and spring seasons as well as the photochemically more active summer and early fall periods...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} societal costs related to public health due to the degradation of air quality {{and the lack of}} physical activity, both affected by our built environment. The paper further shows road safety as another public health concern. Traffic fatalities are the number one cause of death in the world. Traffic accidents result in huge financial loss to the people involved and the related public health cost is {{a significant part of the}} total societal cost. Motor vehicle exhausts and industrial emissions, gasoline vapors, and chemical solvents as well as natural sources emit nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds, which are precursors to the formation of ground-level Ozone. High concentration values of ground-level Ozone in hot <b>summer</b> days produce <b>smog</b> and lead to respiratory problems and loss in worker’s productivity. These factors and associated economic costs to society are important in establishing public policy and decision-making for sustainable transportation and development of communities in both industrialized and developing countries.

The models include predictor variables of daily climatological data, traffic volume and mix, speed, aviation data, and emission inventory of point sources. These models have been implemented in the user friendly AQMAN computer program and used for a case study in Northern Mississippi.

40|$|The {{human cell}} {{mutagenicity}} of {{particulate air pollution}} samples collected in southern California is measured. The human cell mutation assay {{used in this study}} tests mutagenic activity at the thymidine kinase locus in h 1 A 1 v 2 cells using a 72 -h exposure. Throughout 1993, airborne fine particle samples were taken at a regional background site on San Nicolas Island upwind of Los Angeles and at four urban sites:[*] Long Beach, central Los Angeles, Azusa, and Rubidoux. The Long Beach site is in close proximity to direct emissions from industrialized sources including power plants, petroleum refineries, and the Los Angeles−Long Beach harbor complex. Central Los Angeles was chosen because of its dense vehicle traffic, railroad yards, and proximity to the central business district. Azusa and Rubidoux are photochemical smog receptor sites located generally downwind of the highest density of primary emissions sources. No systematic seasonal variation of the mutagenic potency (mutagenicity per unit organic aerosol mass) is observed at any of the urban sites. This suggests that the important human cell mutagens are not dominated by a seasonal emission source such as wood combustion and that if the atmospheric transformation products of photochemical air pollution are involved, then these reactions must occur during the winter as well as during the <b>summer</b> photochemical <b>smog</b> season. No significant spatial variation of annual average mutagenic potency of the aerosol was observed between three of the four urban sites; while the average mutagenic potency of the Long Beach aerosol was slightly higher than elsewhere in the air basin. This similarity of mutagenic potency values across widely separated monitoring sites suggests that the mutagenicity of the aerosol is due largely to ubiquitous emission sources (e. g., motor vehicle traffic or stationary source fuel combustion) rather than to proximity to isolated point sources of unusual mutagenic organics. The mutagen concentration per cubic meter of ambient air was computed by weighting the mutagenic potency values of the aerosol according to the mass concentration of organics present at each monitoring site. The human cell mutagen concentration in Los Angeles urban air was found to be 1 order of magnitude greater than at the background site studied upwind of the city, showing that the city is indeed a source of human cell mutagens...|$|R

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. Groups at risk are exercising people, elderly and children. Between 1990 and 1999 {{the number of children}} in the Netherlands diagnosed with asthma doubled, from about 2. 5 % in 1990 to over 5 % in 1999. Furthermore asthma is the most occurring chronic disease in children. The National Air Quality Monitoring Network (The LML) of the National Institute of Public Health and Environment (RIVM) monitors concentrations of NO 2, O 3 and PM 10 hourly in the Netherlands. The data about medication dispensing is extracted from the InterAction database, which records the dispensing of any medication by pharmacies in the North and East of the Netherlands. The relationship between NO 2 -, O 3 - and PM 10 -concentrations and the dispensed anti-asthma medication to children from 6 until 12 years old was investigated with regression analysis, the significance of the correlation coefficients was determined with a one-tailed t-test. The results show that 125 out of 1184 (= 10. 6 %) investigated correlations were statistically significant, and more significant correlations between O 3 -concentrations and anti-asthma medications than between NO 2 -concentrations and anti-asthma medications appeared, respectively 101 and 24. In 2002 69 significant positive correlations were present while in 2003 there were 56. Furthermore in the city there were 80 significant correlations and in the town 45. Some anti-asthma medications had more significant correlation coefficients than others. ATC-codes starting with R 01 had in total 23, R 03 had 16 and R 06 had 86 significant correlation coefficients, so the latter had the most significant correlations of the three types investigated medications. The statistical meaning of comparing numbers of significant correlations is not dealt with in this report. A surprisingly large number of negative correlations was also found, the meaning of this deserves further research. The results presented in this study indicate that the data that has been used on medication dispensing {{does not seem to be}} a promising way of investigating the relationship between asthma in children and air pollution at first sight, it however may be a valuable method. ...|$|E

40|$|Ozone {{throughout}} the troposphere is subject of significant {{temporal and spatial}} variability due to photochemical production in the planetary boundary layer and free troposphere, stratospheric intrusions, convective events and long range transport. However, high resolving observations of ozone in the troposphere are generally rare today. That is of special disadvantage for limited area models, which represent mathematically a differential equation system with an initial and boundary problem. As ozone concentrations usually increase from the earth surface to the stratosphere, a proper choice of the background ozone concentrations is necessary to reproduce or even predict the amount and distribution of ozone in a specific region of interest. In this paper the impact of background concentrations of ozone on regional scale model results is analysed during a <b>summer</b> <b>smog</b> episode over Europe. For this purpose ozone is artificially partitioned into individual categories. For each category, transport and chemical transformation is calculated separately. Initial and boundary concentrations of ozone dominate total ozone concentrations increasingly with height. But also in the planetary boundary layer they contribute with more than 30 % to the total ozone changes and are therefore far from being negligible. Moderately modified assumptions of background ozone concentrations reveal an uncertainty of near surface ozone concentrations of 5 - 15 % depending on the weather situation...|$|E
