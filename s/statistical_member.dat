40|$|This paper {{presents}} morphological type, membership, and U-V {{color for}} {{a sample of}} galaxies in the Coma cluster direction, complete down to M_B=- 15. 00 mag and extending down to M_B=- 14. 25 mag. We have examined 1155 objects from the GMP 1983 catalog on B and V images of the CFH 12 K camera, and obtained the Hubble type in most cases. Coma cluster membership for 473 galaxies was derived using morphology, apparent size, and surface brightness, and, afterward, redshift. The comparison among morphology- and redshift- memberships and among luminosity functions derived from this morphologically-selected sample, or by using <b>statistical</b> <b>members</b> or spectroscopic members, all show that the morphological membership provided here can be trusted. For the first time, the morphological classification of Coma galaxies reaches magnitudes that are faint enough to observe the whole magnitude range of the giant types, E, S 0, and spiral stages. The data {{presented in this paper}} makes our sample the richest environment where membership and morphology for complete samples down to faint magnitudes M_B~- 15 mag are available, thereby enlarging the baseline of environmental studies.

40|$|Allocations between {{experimental}} groups were hypothesized {{to be affected}} by (a) the type of resource being allocated and (b) whether allocations were for groups as whole units or for individuals within the groups. U. S. college students (N = 19) were asked to allocate a property for individual use (money) and a property for social power (calculator time), between either two individuals or two groups. Respondents allocated more money than calculator time to members of a numerical majority group, but only when allocations were made between groups. This pattern of data reached <b>statistical</b> significance for <b>members</b> of the majority and control groups but not for members of the minority group. The evidence suggests that intergroup allocations reflect fairness norms (such as proportionality and equality between groups) as well as in-group favoritism. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that the volatility of asset prices displays considerable persistence. That is, large movements in prices tend {{to be followed by}} more large moves, producing positive serial correlation in squared returns. Thus, current and past volatility can be used to predict future volatility. This fact is important to both financial market practitioners and regulators. Professional traders in equity and foreign exchange markets must pay attention not only to the expected return from their trading activity but also to the risk that they incur. Risk-averse investors will wish to reduce their exposure during periods of high volatility, and improvements in risk-adjusted performance depend upon the accuracy of volatility predictions. Many current models of risk management, such as Value-at-Risk (VaR), use volatility predictions as inputs. The bank capital adequacy standards recently proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision illustrate the importance of sophisticated risk management techniques for regulators. These norms are aimed at providing international banks with greater incentives to manage financial risk in a sophisticated fashion, so that they might economize on capital. One such system that is widely used is RiskMetrics™, developed by J. P. Morgan. A core component of the RiskMetrics system is a <b>statistical</b> model—a <b>member</b> of the large ARCH/ GARCH family—that forecasts volatility. Such ARCH/ Christopher J.

40|$|The forest owner cooperatives in Sweden were {{established}} {{almost a century}} ago with the aim to improve the private forest owners’ bargaining situation and improve silviculture (the study, cultivation, and management of forest trees). The characteristics of today’s private forest owners and forest industry are changing, something which should encourage the forest owner cooperatives to consider adaptations of their organizations. The aims of this paper are, first, to describe characteristics of forest owner cooperative members and second, to probe the applicability of farm cooperative research in this venture. The statements that are tested are based on characteristics established in farm cooperative research and refer to (i) a negative relation between forest cooperative member’s age and property size, (ii) a positive relation between member’s age and proportion of trade accomplished through the cooperative, (iii) a positive relation between member’s age and membership in cooperative boards and committees, and, finally, (iv) a positive relation between property size and resignation from the forest cooperative. The hypotheses were tested on data from Norra SkogsÃ¤garna, a forest cooperative in northern Sweden. None of the propositions found support in the data. The results thus indicate that forest cooperative members may differ from farm cooperative members in several respects. The premise is put forward {{that this may be}} due to differences between forest and farm owners’ situations with respect to market characteristics and investment intensity, something that can affect membership expectations.

40|$|The Burr type XII (BXII) {{distribution}} {{has been}} largely used in different fields due to its great flexibility for fitting data.

In order to give more flexibility to the BXII distribution, in this paper, modifications to this distribution {{through the use of}} parametric functions are introduced. For instance, members of this new family of distributions allow the analysis not only of data containing extreme values as the BXII distribution, but also of light-tailed data. We refer to this new family of distributions as the extended Burr Type XII distribution (EBXIID) family. <b>Statistical</b> properties of <b>members</b> of the EBXIID family are discussed.

40|$|This {{paper is}} an applied {{research}} {{in terms of}} objective and a descriptive research in terms of method. Having prepared the research plan, a questionnaire was designed based on goals and hypotheses of the research and {{was sent to the}} statistical universe. Also this paper is a field research in terms of data collection. As regards theoretical bases of the research, library data collection method has been applied. So, the required data has been gathered by referring to the related references, books, libraries and so on. To design a questionnaire and gather the opinions of the <b>statistical</b> universe <b>members,</b> field study method and researcher-made questionnaire have been used. The statistical universe comprises nurses and head of ICU and head nurses of Najmieh Hospital in Tehran. The respondents were selected by random sampling method. Also to estimate sample size, Morgan table was applied. The statistical universe consists of 65 members and according to the table, 56 questionnaires were determined for the research. So 60 questionnaires were sent and 58 ones were returned. Face and content validity of the research tool were approved by experts. The test reliability was estimated 0. 777 by calculating Cronbach's alpha coefficient. In this paper, factor analysis based on partial least squares structural equations method has been applied to analyze more important factors and coefficients, estimate independent variables coefficients and even determine effectiveness of each independent variable on each other and determine appropriateness of the questions and their coefficients in explaining the related index.
