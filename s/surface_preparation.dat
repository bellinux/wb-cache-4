25|$|Hydrodemolition (also {{known as}} hydro demolition, hydroblasting, hydro blasting, hydromilling, waterblasting, and waterjetting) is a {{concrete}} removal technique which utilizes high-pressure water to remove deteriorated and sound concrete {{as well as}} asphalt and grout. This process provides an excellent bonding surface for repair material and new coating applications. First developed in Europe in the 1970s, this technology has become widely accepted for concrete removal and <b>surface</b> <b>preparation</b> throughout Europe and North America.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{coloring}} {{of metals}} {{is an art}} involving craftsmanship and experience. Coloring techniques depend upon time, temperature, <b>surface</b> <b>preparation,</b> humidity and other variables. Pre-patinated copper sheets are produced by fabricators under controlled environments using patented chemical processes. Green patina finishes are primarily developed using acid chloride or acid sulfate. Treatments with ammonium chloride (sal ammoniac), cuprous chloride/hydrochloric acid, and ammonium sulfate are somewhat successful. Statuary finishes can be produced in light, medium, and dark brown, depending on the concentration and number of coloring applications. One advantage is that the treatment disguises surface markings on bright mill finish copper and can advance the natural patination process.|$|E
40|$|Cell <b>surface</b> <b>{{preparations}}</b> and ribosomal preparations were {{extracted from}} Klebsiella pneumoniae. Agar gel diffusion with antisera to cell <b>surface</b> <b>preparations</b> or ribosomal preparations indicated common antigenic components among the preparations. Lipopolysaccharide and capsular polysaccharide {{were identified in}} the cell <b>surface</b> <b>preparations.</b> These results and the previous identification of lipopolysaccharide and capsular polysaccharide in ribosomal preparations suggest that these antigens {{are responsible for the}} immunochemical cross-reactivity observed among these two bacterial extracts. Active protection could be induced in mice by these two preparations. On a dry-weight basis, cell <b>surface</b> <b>preparations</b> provided better immunoprotective activity than did ribosomal preparations. However, the 50 % protective dose of both preparations is practically the same {{on the basis of their}} capsular polysaccharide content. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the immunoprotective moiety of ribosomal preparations is the contaminating cell surface antigens. Furthermore, the low level of nucleotidic components detected in purified cell <b>surface</b> <b>preparations</b> led us to infer that the immunoprotective activity of capsular polysaccharide may not be dependent on the adjuvant activity of ribonucleic acid. The involvement of capsular polysaccharide in the immunoprotective capacity of cell <b>surface</b> <b>preparations</b> is demonstrated either by using a degradation of this antigen by K. pneumoniae bacteriophage K 2 -associated glycanase or by using a preparation extracted from a noncapsulated mutant of K. pneumoniae. Nevertheless, the low protective ability of purified capsular polysaccharides is in contrast to its greater activity when induced in bacterial cell <b>surface</b> <b>preparations.</b> The protective activity of K. pneumoniae capsular polysaccharide may be dependent on its association with other surface antigenic components present in cell <b>surface</b> <b>preparations</b> or may be dependent on its native form in the bacterial cell surface...|$|R

40|$|The immunoprotective {{activity}} of Klebsiella pneumoniae K 2 cell <b>surface</b> <b>preparations</b> and {{purified capsular polysaccharide}} was tested in mice. The 50 % protective dose (PD 50), expressed as capsular polysaccharide content, was 2 ng for cell <b>surface</b> <b>preparations</b> and 50 ng for purified capsular polysaccharide. Both preparations lost their immunoprotective activity after alkali treatment. Immune sera were raised in rabbits immunized with cell <b>surface</b> <b>preparations.</b> The precipitating and hemagglutinating capacity of these antisera was tested against either purified capsular polysaccharide or alkali-treated capsular polysaccharide. No difference was observed between the re{{activity of}} the antisera against each antigen. The protective activity of these sera was tested on mice in passive transfer experiments, before and after absorption with either purified capsular polysaccharide or alkali-treated capsular polysaccharide. The sera lost their protective activity after absorption with purified capsular polysaccharide and after absorption with alkali-treated capsular polysaccharide. These experiments show that the difference in immunoprotective activity of cell <b>surface</b> <b>preparations,</b> purified capsular polysaccharide, and alkali-treated capsular polysaccharide is not due to {{a difference in their}} antigenic determinants. Cell <b>surface</b> <b>preparations</b> and purified capsular polysaccharide were fractionated by gel filtration on Sepharose 4 B and by ultracentrifugation on cesium chloride density gradients. Three forms of capsular polysaccharide have been characterized. (i) A form of capsular polysaccharide with a very high protective activity (PD 50 = 2 ng) that copurified with protein and lipopolysaccharide and was characterized by a low coefficient of distribution (Kd = 0. 20) and a low density (1. 5 to 1. 6 g/cm 3). (ii) A form of capsular polysaccharide with an intermediate protective activity (PD 50 = 50 ng), contamined by less than 3 % protein and 1 % lipopolysaccharide, with a Kd of 0. 35, and a density of 1. 7 to 1. 8 g/cm 3. (iii) A nonimmunoprotective capsular polysaccharide obtained after alkali treatment of either cell <b>surface</b> <b>preparations</b> or purified capsular polysaccharide. The Kd of these fractions varied from 0. 20 to 0. 90 and their density from 1. 7 to 1. 8 g/cm 3...|$|R

The skin samples were mounted in Franz-type diffusion cells and transdermal hydrocortisone penetration was measured over 30 h. The pseudo-steady-state flux (JSS) of hydrocortisone through S, Al-C, Aq-C and TS skin was, respectively, 2. 3 (P = 0. 021), 2. 2 (P = 0. 037), 2. 0 (P = 0. 070) and 1. 5 (P = 0. 351) times greater than through the control skin, {{but there were no}} significant differences in the lag times (tlag) for hydrocortisone penetration between the groups.
