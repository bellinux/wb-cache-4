40|$|Bibliography: pages 100 - 108. The <b>snoek</b> Thyrsites atun is an {{important}} fish predator in the southern Benguela region. It is exploited by both a handline and a demersal fishery. A survey of the Cape line fishery revealed that <b>snoek</b> line fishing effort is changing from the traditional harbour-based line-boat to the nomadic ski-boat. It was widely claimed that <b>snoek</b> catches are declining and that migration patterns are changing. <b>Snoek</b> constitute a by-catch of the hake-directed demersal fishery but nevertheless are seasonally important. The principle prey of <b>snoek</b> caught by handline off the Cape Peninsula were anchovy and mantis shrimp. <b>Snoek</b> caught in midwater trawls offshore were feeding primarily on anchovy, with pilchard, euphausiids and amphipods also important. <b>Snoek</b> trawled demersally had a more diverse diet, dominated by redeye roundberring, lightfish, lanternfish, hake, buttersnoek and euphausiids. <b>Snoek</b> {{were caught in the}} demersal environment throughout daylight hours, but may come off the bottom at night. The small degree of overlap between the diet of <b>snoek</b> caught demersally offshore and that of <b>snoek</b> caught in the pelagic zone, both inshore and offshore, indicates that <b>snoek</b> do not seem to move extensively on a diurnal basis between the two zones. Over the period 1970 to 1985 availability of <b>snoek</b> to the handline fishery was strongly seasonal, with catches peaking from May to July, although the traditional winter <b>snoek</b> run is a declining phenomenon along the South African coast. At Dassen Island, for which catch data have only been available since 1981, peak months were from November to January. The <b>snoek</b> seems to move offshore from July and is trawled demersally until September. The presence of <b>snoek</b> larvae offshore between June and September indicates an offshore spawning migration. With the exception of the summer presence in the region of Dassen Island, <b>snoek</b> appear to be present in the southern Benguela region between April and September. Handline catches of <b>snoek</b> have declined markedly since 1978, but demersal catches have remained more stable...|$|R
40|$|Magister Philosophiae (Land and Agrarian Studies) - MPhil(LAS) In the Western Cape, <b>snoek</b> (Thyrsites atun) is {{a target}} for small scale fisheries. This fishery is {{comprised}} of recreational, subsistence and traditional line fisheries in the province. <b>Snoek</b> contributes 40 % to 50 % of the line fish which is landed. This thesis sought to identify the roles which are performed by informal <b>snoek</b> traders in certain Cape Town coloured 1 townships in the <b>snoek</b> value chain. There are various aspects of this fish which heightens its importance in the Western Cape. <b>Snoek</b> is significant {{in the provision of}} food security for many poor and working class individuals and households within the coloured townships of Cape Town. <b>Snoek</b> is an omega 3 -rich fish {{and is one of the}} Cape’s most well-known gastronomic traditions. It provides affordable and easily absorbable proteins, vitamins and minerals for township people. Poor people mostly rely on starches and fail to afford the most expensive protein sources like red meat. The <b>snoek</b> trade also helps in the creation of jobs and enables people to earn cash income. The study revealed that there is specialisation and division of labour between <b>snoek</b> traders and fishers. <b>Snoek</b> is sold via the auction system at the various landing zones scattered all over the Western Cape. It was observed that the <b>snoek</b> value chain is dominated by men and there are few women in the value chain who sell or clean <b>snoek.</b> Informal <b>snoek</b> traders ply their business next to shops or on the sides of busy roads using ‘bakkies’ 2 from where the fish is flayed and sold to the waiting customer to emphasise its freshness. <b>Snoek</b> traders create convenience by bringing fresh fish to customers in the townships. They also assume risks which come with venturing in business. Some <b>snoek</b> traders engage in multiple livelihood strategies by diversifying income generating activities rather than relying on one income source. Among the several challenges which <b>snoek</b> traders confront, one pressing challenge they need to address is their lack of organisation which prohibits them from speaking with one voice. The <b>snoek</b> value chain should be more efficient so that it keeps supplying the much needed nutrients in the townships. Both primary and secondary data collection techniques were used. <b>Snoek</b> traders face a myriad of challenges which require the authorities to address. They have no access to infrastructure with sanitary facilities. The other problem they face is that they are disorganised amongst themselves which weaken their cause. Traders and fishers would like to see the real transformation taking place within this <b>snoek</b> fishery. Traders are convinced that there is corruption within the fisheries department and many have lost faith in the system...|$|R

40|$|Cape <b>snoek</b> (Thyrsites atun) is an {{important}} source of protein for people in South Africa; however, nutritional information thereof is limited. The proximate and fatty acid compositions of raw and cooked (80 °C) <b>snoek</b> muscles were determined according to official AOAC methods. The mean moisture, ash, total lipids and protein for raw <b>snoek</b> were 72. 8 ± 1. 86 %, 1. 3 ± 0. 09 %, 4. 0 ± 1. 16 and 21. 5 ± 1. 35 %, respectively. Cape <b>snoek</b> is very high in palmitic acid (24. 65 ± 1. 43 %), oleic acid (18. 21 ± 2. 64 %), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 9. 11 ± 2. 06 %) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 19. 70 ± 3. 25 %). With the exception of total lipids, cooking significantly reduced moisture (69. 40 ± 2. 03 %) and ash (1. 12 ± 0. 12 %), and increased protein (24. 47 ± 1. 39 %) content.

40|$|Abstract: The <b>Snoek</b> relaxation, a {{specific}} point-defect induced anelastic relaxation phenomenon, {{is characteristic of}} an internal friction peak in bcc metals with interstitial solutes. Such internal friction mechanism has not been applied {{in the development of}} high damping alloy while grain boundary and twin boundary featured anelastic relaxations are applied in some high damping alloys. In this paper, the fundamental principles and experimental results concerning the <b>Snoek</b> relaxation are reviewed, and the feasibility to apply the <b>Snoek</b> relaxation mechanism into high damping alloys is discussed. Due to the peak-shape behavior in the <b>Snoek</b> relaxation type damping, composition design of a high damping alloys should takes temperature position, broadness and also peak height into account. Ti-Nb-O and Ti-V-Cr-O alloys are designed and fabricated by CCLM casting in our laboratory. It is conformed that the damping behaviors of the alloys are of <b>Snoek</b> relaxation type showing obvious frequency and temperature dependence. While the broadened damping peak caused by the substitutional solutes is advantage to improve the temperature stability of damping capacity, a large concentration of interstitial solute and texture control are required to improve the reduced damping capacity. 1...|$|R
