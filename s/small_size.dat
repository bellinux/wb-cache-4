40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to study the current situation and problems in developing educational quality by stakeholders’ participation in <b>small</b> <b>sized</b> schools. The research found that: For current situation and problem before developing the educational quality by stakeholders’ participation in <b>small</b> <b>sized</b> schools, both of <b>small</b> <b>sized</b> school teachers and administrators didn’t have system of educational quality by stakeholders’ participation in <b>small</b> <b>sized</b> schools clearly. For findings of system development by creating system from documentary synthesis, related literature, and action research of system criticizing, asking for experts’ suggestions, found that the system for developing educational quality by stakeholders’ participation in <b>small</b> <b>sized</b> schools including: 1) the organizational leading, 2) the strategic planning, 3) the focus on student quality, 4) the measurement of analysis and knowledge management, 5) the staff oriented, 6) the process management, and 7) the product. All of 7 factors would be in context of administration and management including the related associating and integrating based on environmental relation with stakeholders’ community organization. In addition, the challenge would be related factor in every step of system development in educational quality by stakeholders’ participation in <b>small</b> <b>sized</b> schools which would be guideline for managing <b>small</b> <b>sized</b> schools to be more efficient and effective.

5|$|A small, unisex monastic {{community}} in Bithynia, near Constantinople, may {{have developed the}} cross-in-square plan church during the Iconoclastic period, which would explain the plan's small scale and unified naos. The ruined church of St. John at Pelekete monastery is an early example. Monks had supported the use of icons, unlike the government-appointed secular clergy, and monasticism would become increasingly popular. A new type of privately funded urban monastery developed from the 9th century on, which may help to explain the <b>small</b> <b>size</b> of subsequent building.|$|E
5|$|A {{symmetric}} multiprocessor (SMP) is {{a computer}} system with multiple identical processors that share memory and connect via a bus. Bus contention prevents bus architectures from scaling. As a result, SMPs generally do not comprise more than 32processors. Because of the <b>small</b> <b>size</b> of the processors and the significant reduction in the requirements for bus bandwidth achieved by large caches, such symmetric multiprocessors are extremely cost-effective, provided that a sufficient amount of memory bandwidth exists.|$|E
5|$|All {{species of}} cone snails are venomous and can sting painfully when handled, {{although}} many species {{are too small}} to pose much of a risk to humans, and only a few fatalities have been reliably reported. Their venom is a complex mixture of toxins, some fast-acting and others slower but deadlier. The effects of individual cone-shell toxins on victims' nervous systems are so precise as to be useful tools for research in neurology, and the <b>small</b> <b>size</b> of their molecules makes it easy to synthesize them.|$|E

It is also thought that Arctic terns may, in spite of their <b>small</b> <b>size,</b> occasionally engage in kleptoparasitism by swooping at birds so as to startle them into releasing their catches. Several species are targeted—conspecifics, other terns (like the common tern), and some auk and grebe species.|$|E
5|$|At first sight, frogs seem rather defenceless {{because of}} their <b>small</b> <b>size,</b> slow movement, thin skin, and lack of {{defensive}} structures, such as spines, claws or teeth. Many use camouflage to avoid detection, the skin often being spotted or streaked in neutral colours that allow a stationary frog to merge into its surroundings. Some can make prodigious leaps, often into water, that help them to evade potential attackers, while many have other defensive adaptations and strategies.|$|E
