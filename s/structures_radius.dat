40|$|The {{performance}} of nearest neighbor (NN) queries degrades noticeably with increasing dimensionality of the data. This stems {{not only from}} reduced selectivity of high-dimensional data but also from an increased number of seek operations during query execution. We propose a new framework to transform NN queries into at most two range queries. This is achieved by first estimating the NN-radius, performing a range query with this radius, and (if not enough NNs were found) estimating the NN-radius again and performing a second range query. Since range queries know the set of pages to be read in advance, a page read scheduler can be employed to minimize read costs. This scheme guarantees that the query cost is bounded from above by the cost of 2 linear scans over {{a subset of the}} data pages, while typically resulting in costs well below a single scan. Our framework can be instantiated with different range query index <b>structures,</b> <b>radius</b> estimators, and page read schedulers. We prese [...] ...|$|E

In this work, the influence of two selected dicationic (gemini) surfac-tants (3, 3 ′-[1, 8 -(2, 7 -dioxaoctane) ]bis(1 -dodecylimidazolium) chloride and 3, 3 ′-[1, 12 -(2, 11 -dioxadodecane) ]bis(1 -dodecylimidazolium) chloride) on two model proteins, bovine serum albumin (BSA) and hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL), have been investigated. A pronounced and sophisticated influ-ence on BSA structure has been revealed, including a consider-able change of protein radius of gyration as well as substantial alteration of its secondary <b>structure.</b> <b>Radius</b> of gyration {{has been found to}} rise significantly with addition of surfactants and to fall down for high surfactants concentration.
