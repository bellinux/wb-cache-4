Simulation was run from 1970 to 2008 with historical inventories. Simulated SOC stock was compared with observations in a nation-wide stationary monitoring program conducted during 1979 – 1998. Historical land-use change, characterized by a large decline in the area of paddy fields as well as a small but continuous decline in the area of orchards, occurred along with a relatively large increase in upland crop fields, unmanaged grasslands, and settlements (i. e. conversion of agricultural fields due to urbanization or abandoning). Results of the simulation on SOC <b>stock</b> <b>change</b> under varying land-use change indicated that land-use conversion from agricultural fields to settlements or other lands, as well as that from paddy fields to croplands have likely been an increasing source of CO 2 emission, due to the reduction of organic carbon input to soils and the enhancement of SOC decomposition through transition of soil environment from anaerobic to aerobic conditions. The area-weighted mean concentrations of the simulated SOC stocks calculated for major soil groups under paddy fields and upland crop fields were comparable to those observed in the monitoring. Whereas in orchards, the simulated SOC stocks were underestimated. As the results of simulation indicated that SOC <b>stock</b> <b>change</b> under managed grasslands and settlements has been likely a major sink and source of CO 2 emission at country-scale, respectively, validation of SOC <b>stock</b> <b>change</b> under these land-use types, which could not have been accomplished due to limited availability or a lack of measurement, remains a forthcoming challenge...|$|E

The measured <b>stock</b> <b>change</b> estimate decreased much more than the model predictions. Model results varied not only due to the model structure and applied parameters, but also due to different input information and assumptions applied during the modelling processes.

40|$|At {{the moment}} three {{alternative}} approaches for estimating emissions and removals of CO 2 from forest harvesting and wood products are under discussion. These are atmospheric flow approach, <b>stock</b> <b>change</b> approach, {{and the production}} approach. Several methodologies are being developed {{to deal with these}} approaches. In the present report we test two of those The &apos;Forest Research Institute from New Zealand has developed an Excel based model&apos; (FR), and the FA model (Alterra supported by FORM Ecology Consultants). The IPCC approaches themselves are not under study here, only the models representing them. Above that, a sensitivity analysis of the data input has been done, with a special focus on life spans. The models are qualitatively and quantitatively compared, and a sensitivity analysis on life spans was carried out. In principle both models (FR &amp; FA) are very comparable, and can in principle be used as a basis for improved IPCC guidelines in this area. However, the current FR model focuses on the carbon dynamics in the long life span products only (on purpose), and thus lacks the following sources of CO 2 : actual burning of fuelwood (in atmospheric flow and production approach), immediate decomposition of wood residues (in atmospheric flow and production), and harvest figures (in <b>stock</b> <b>change</b> approach), which are relevant for determining the overall wood products carbon balance of a country. Thus the results of a full quantitative comparison of the FR and FA model were not so relevant. Finally, it is noted that the production approach can be interpreted in different ways. A wide variety of life span estimates was found in literature. Different shapes of decay functions are used. Also, confusion can occur because the half lives, total lives, as well as in- or excluding the disposed off phase, are used in literature. This contributes a lot to the uncertainty regarding life spans. The carbon balance of wood products showed the strongest sensitivity to life spans for New Zealand and The Netherlands. Especially the production approach is sensitive for changes in life spans. The overall effect of a decrease in life span is an increase of the sources, {{or in the case of}} The Netherlands under the <b>stock</b> <b>change</b> approach, a change from sink to source...|$|E
40|$|Important {{land use}} changes are {{expected}} in the European Union (EU) the coming decades, having effects on carbon stocks in soil and vegetation. We assessed how future land use change (LUC) can influence future carbon <b>stock</b> <b>change</b> in soil and vegetation in the EU. The {{emphasis is on the}} role of LUC in the overall carbon balance of the EU biosphere. Because LUC is the most dynamic driving factor of terrestrial carbon <b>stock</b> <b>change,</b> it is important to account for the dynamics of LUC in carbon <b>stock</b> <b>change</b> modelling. The major challenge in coupling a carbon model and a LUC model is the difference in spatial and temporal resolution generally used in these modelling approaches. We used a high-resolution LUC model and a carbon bookkeeping approach that takes into account effects of soil and forest age on carbon stock changes. These approaches best fit the chosen resolution and extent in a consistent manner. Four SRES scenarios that cover a range of possible future developments were evaluated: Global Economy (A 1) : lean government, strong globalization; Continental Markets (A 2) : lean government, regional cultural and economic development; Global Co-operation (B 1) : much governmental intervention, strong globalization; Regional Communities (B 2) : much governmental intervention, regional cultural and economic development. If land use remains unchanged, carbon sequestration rates are expected to decrease by 4 % in 2030 relative to 2000. LUC causes an additional sequestration rate decrease in the A 2 scenario of 2 % in 2030. In the other three scenarios, sequestration rate increases by 9 - 16 % in 2030 relative to 2000. In 2030, the terrestrial biosphere in the EU is expected to sequester between 90 and 111 Tg C year- 1. This is 6. 5 - 8 % of the projected anthropogenic emissions. In the B 2 scenario, the highest sequestration rate increase is expected (15 Tg C year- 1). Clear differences are found in the spatial distribution of sinks and sources between the scenarios, illustrating that land use {{is an important factor in}} future carbon sequestration changes that cannot be ignored...|$|E
40|$|This project {{aimed to}} {{identify}} {{the extent to which}} emissions due to changes in Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) stocks arising from Cropland and Grassland/Grazing Land management can be incorporated into the UK’s Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) inventory. Key management activities were identified which might affect SOC stocks. A literature review carried out as part of the project concluded that tillage reduction cannot be considered a reliable management option to increase the SOC content of UK soils. However increasing crop residue returns and increasing inputs of manure and fertiliser could increase SOC stock although the SOC stock increases resulting from manure and fertiliser inputs could be outweighed by increases nitrous oxide emissions and the risk of nitrate run-off. The review found that increasing crop yields through increased fertilisation and improved crop rotation could increase the annual input of crop residues and root exudate to soils and hence increase SOC on low fertility soils. Manure additions resulted in greater C sequestration than the addition of equivalent amounts of N as mineral fertiliser and the effect lasted longer. However, increasing inputs of nitrogen from fertiliser or manure risk increasing N 2 O emissions which could negate any increases in SOC stock. IPCC default <b>stock</b> <b>change</b> factors were judged to be inappropriate to the UK, based on expert opinion and the literature review findings. Therefore the project used the Daily DayCent and Landscape DNDC models to attempt to estimate <b>stock</b> <b>change</b> factors for Cropland management activities under UK conditions. Although based on a very limited dataset this suggested that the effect of Cropland management activities under UK conditions might be less than implied by the IPCC <b>stock</b> <b>change</b> factors. Tillage reduction was found to have little effect on SOC stocks. Increasing manure and crop residue inputs increased SOC stocks, with manure inputs being particularly effective. A framework for reporting SOC stock changes resulting from Cropland management was developed, and used to assess mitigation options. Overall the impact of Cropland Management on SOC is likely to be very small compared to other activities in the LULUCF inventory such as land use change. The most effective mitigation option was using Cropland from annual tillage crops to perennial crops, fallow and set aside. However given the need for food production there is limited scope for such change. Increasing manure, fertiliser and crop residue inputs gave smaller increases in SOC stocks, but practical considerations limit the scope of these actions. Lack of field data on the effect of Grassland improvement on SOC stocks was identified as a knowledge gap. The literature review suggested that intensification could increase SOC stocks under pasture on mineral soils. However, expert opinion suggested that this might not be the case for rough grazing on organo-mineral soils, where intensification might lead to SOC loss. This lack of data meant that {{it was not possible to}} calibrate or validate models to estimate UK specific <b>stock</b> <b>change</b> factors for Grassland. As the IPCC <b>stock</b> <b>change</b> factors were judged to be inappropriate to UK conditions assessment of the mitigation potential of Grassland management using these factors was not carried out to avoid presenting potentially misleading results. Suggested strategies for filling these knowledge gaps are outlined in the report. Attempts to assess grass/crop rotation patterns across the UK using data from the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) used to handle Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) payments were hampered by difficulties in obtaining access to the data. However land use change matrices were generated for England and Wales, and used to map areas of change. Subject to data availability, this approach could be used in future inventories to give a better representation the effect of rotation patterns on SOC stocks. ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Computer {{models have}} been used to assess soil organic carbon (SOC) <b>stock</b> <b>change.</b> Commonly, models require to {{determine}} soil bulk density (Db), a variable that is often lacking in soil data bases. To partly overcome this problem, pedotransfer functions (PTFs) are developed to estimate Db from other easily available soil properties. However, only a few studies have determined the accuracy of these functions and quantified their effects on the final quality of the spatial variability maps. In this context, the objectives of this study were: i) to develop one PTF to estimate Db in soils of the Brazilian Central Amazon region; ii) to compare the performance of PTFs generated with three other models generally used to estimate Db in soils of the Amazon region; and iii) to quantify the effect of applying these PTFs on the spatial variability maps of SOC stock. Using data from 96 soil profiles in the Urucu river basin in Brazil, a multiple linear regression model was generated to estimate Db using SOC, pH, sum of basic cations, aluminum (Al+ 3), and clay content. This model outperformed the three other PTFs published in the literature. The average estimation error of SOC stock using our model was 0. 03 Mg C ha− 1, which is markedly lower than the other PTFs (1. 06 and 1. 23 Mg C ha− 1, or 15 % and 17 %, respectively). Thus, the application of a non-validated PTF to estimate Db can introduce an error that is large enough to skew the significant difference in soil carbon <b>stock</b> <b>change...</b>|$|E

Results suggest that an initial forest C risk matrix may be constructed to focus attention on short- and long-term risks to forest C stocks (as opposed to implementation in decision making) using inventory-based estimates of total stocks and associated estimates of variability (i. e., coefficient of variation) among climate zones. The empirical parameterization of such a risk matrix highlighted numerous knowledge gaps: 1) robust measures of the likelihood of forest C <b>stock</b> <b>change</b> under climate change scenarios, 2) projections of forest C stocks given unforeseen socioeconomic conditions (i. e., land-use change), and 3) appropriate social responses to global change events {{for which there is no}} contemporary climate/disturbance analog (e. g., severe droughts in the Lake States) ...|$|E

Results of the DEM software comparison showed that while TERREST {{has the potential to}} produce much higher resolution DEM than ERDAS, it is unable to resolve crucial canopy features adequately. Lab tests demonstrated that additional laser data improves image registration and Z-axis DEM quality. Data collected in the field revealed difficult challenges in correctly modeling the location of laser strike and subsequently determining elevations in both software packages. Automated software segmentation of tree canopies provided stem diameter and biomass carbon estimates that were within 3 % of comparable ground based estimates in the Ohio site and produced similar biomass estimates for a limited number of plots in the Duke forest. Tree height change between time periods and canopy segmentation from multispectral imagery allowed calculation of forest carbon <b>stock</b> <b>change</b> at costs that are comparable to those for ground-based methods.

Additional research on automated canopy segmentation and multi-temporal image registration is needed to refine these methods for commercial use...|$|E
40|$|Successful {{regulation}} of common-pool resources {{calls for a}} better understanding of resource exploitation behavior. This paper introduces an approach that can measure fishermen's responsiveness to <b>stock</b> <b>changes</b> more accurately. In order to deal with the challenge of the latent fish stock, I adopt the method proposed by Zhang and Smith (2011) that derives a stock index from a heterogeneous production function. I use the imputed stock proxy in a count data model that describes fishing trip frequency. By these two steps, I can estimate the stock elasticity of fishing mortality. In the empirical study of the reef-fish fishery in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, I find that the popular method that uses catch rate as a stock proxy significantly underestimates fishermen's responses to <b>stock</b> <b>changes.</b> This result suggests that policy predictions based on the traditional method are overly optimistic. ...|$|R
