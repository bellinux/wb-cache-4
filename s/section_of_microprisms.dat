40|$|This report {{describes}} a short experimental {{investigation of the}} degree to which the visibility of green leafhoppers to video can be enhanced by the use of marking materials. The visibility of leafhopper-sized targets against surrounding vegetation can be greatly enhanced in additional (artificial) lighting by attaching small pieces <b>of</b> <b>microprism</b> retro-reflecting tape to the thorax of the insect. Tables are included giving the utility of various marker materials, the target visibility results, and the field of view of targets under different illuminating wavelengths...|$|R
40|$|A facile, but effective, two-step {{method was}} {{developed}} to prepare monoclinic LaPO₄:Eu³⁺ microspheres composed <b>of</b> <b>microprisms</b> with a controllable morphology. XRD and SEM studies revealed a spherical morphology and crystalline structure for the resulting material. It was also found that LaPO₄:Eu³⁺ microspheres prepared at 800 °C showed a higher luminescent intensity than primary hexagonal LaPO₄:Eu³⁺ microprisms. Furthermore, the luminescent performance of LaPO₄:Eu³⁺ microspheres was demonstrated {{to reach the standards}} of the LaPO₄:Eu³⁺ bulk material under the same conditions. These results suggest possibilities for the use of as-synthesized monoclinic LaPO₄:Eu³⁺ microspheres as alternatives to replace intrinsically uneven bulk materials for many application areas, including light display systems and optoelectronic devices. 6 page(s...|$|R
40|$|By the {{developments}} in ultra precision micro machining appreciable progress {{could be achieved}} {{in the production of}} large area micro- structured molds. With the help of these tools light steering films for computer displays or space-saving lighting concepts can be realized economically. On the other hand innovative production concepts cohere with new challenges for the quality control of the production process. For the production of large area micro-structured surfaces measuring procedures are needed, which are able to characterize complex surface geometries in optical quality fast and {{as close as possible to}} the machine. Thus, the main tasks are the measurement of steep slopes and the reduction of measurement time. The presented solutions are based on the systematic tilting of microstructured parts and the use of flexible lighting concepts to make surface geometries with steep slopes measurable. Another concept is based on the transfer of the interferometric form testing to the field of microstructures. A fast and automated interferometric form testing <b>of</b> <b>microprism</b> and microsphere arrays is presented...|$|R
