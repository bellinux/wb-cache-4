25|$|Howard Hampton, {{former leader}} of the Ontario New Democratic Party, argues that this {{averaging}} out {{of the cost of}} power ensures supply meets demand in a cost-effective manner. For example, to ensure overall <b>system</b> <b>reliability,</b> a considerable portion of generation capacity from peaking plants must remain idle most of the time. Operating costs for peaking plants, however, are usually expensive because they inefficiently convert costly fossil fuels to electricity.|$|E
25|$|In {{the field}} of <b>system</b> <b>reliability</b> {{orthogonal}} redundancy is that form of redundancy where the form of backup device or method is completely different from the prone to error device or method. The failure mode of an orthogonally redundant back-up device or method does not intersect with and is completely different from the failure mode of the device or method in need of redundancy to safeguard the total system against catastrophic failure.|$|E
25|$|One early {{introduction}} of energy market concepts and privatization to electric power systems {{took place in}} Chile in the early 1981s, in parallel with other market-oriented reforms associated with the Chicago Boys. The Chilean model was generally perceived as successful in bringing rationality and transparency to power pricing. Argentina improved on the Chilean model by imposing strict limits on market concentration and by improving the structure of payments to units held in reserve to assure <b>system</b> <b>reliability.</b> One of the principal purposes of the {{introduction of}} market concepts in Argentina was to privatize existing generation assets (which had fallen into disrepair under the government-owned monopoly, resulting in frequent service interruptions) and to attract capital needed for rehabilitation of those assets and for system expansion. The World Bank was active in introducing a variety of hybrid markets in other Latin American nations, including Peru, Brazil, and Colombia, during the 1990s, with limited success.|$|E

2500|$|The {{enclosed}} {{parabolic trough}} solar thermal system encapsulates the components within an off-the-shelf greenhouse type of glasshouse. The glasshouse protects the components {{from the elements}} that can negatively impact <b>system</b> <b>reliability</b> and efficiency. [...] This protection importantly includes nightly glass-roof washing with optimized water-efficient off-the-shelf automated washing systems. Lightweight curved solar-reflecting mirrors are suspended from {{the ceiling of the}} glasshouse by wires. A single-axis tracking system positions the mirrors to retrieve the optimal amount of sunlight. The mirrors concentrate the sunlight and focus it on a network of stationary steel pipes, also suspended from the glasshouse structure. Water is pumped through the pipes and boiled to generate steam when intense sun radiation is applied. The steam is available for process heat. Sheltering the mirrors from the wind allows them to achieve higher temperature rates and prevents dust from building up on the mirrors as a result from exposure to humidity.|$|E

40|$|In the {{big data}} era, <b>systems</b> <b>reliability</b> is {{critical}} to effective systems risk management. In this paper, a novel multiobjective approach, with hybridization of a known algorithm called NSGA-II and an adaptive population-based simulated annealing (APBSA) method is developed to solve the <b>systems</b> <b>reliability</b> optimization problems. In the first step, to create a good algorithm, we use a coevolutionary strategy. Since the proposed algorithm is very sensitive to parameter values, the response surface method is employed to estimate the appropriate parameters of the algorithm. Moreover, to examine the performance of our proposed approach, several test problems are generated, and the proposed hybrid algorithm and other commonly known approaches (i. e., MOGA, NRGA, and NSGA-II) are compared with respect to four performance measures: 1) mean ideal distance; 2) diversification metric; 3) percentage of domination; and 4) data envelopment analysis.
