25|$|Rossakoff {{arrives at}} Poirot's flat. She happily confesses to Poirot that <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> jewels in the professor's pocket {{as she had}} found them in her own bag when the raid started, and {{so she had to}} get rid of them as quickly as she could. It was Varesco who planted them on her and she admits that he is the true owner of the premises. Poirot takes her into the next room where Higgs and Cerberus are waiting. Higgs can handle any dog and took the {{otherwise}} fierce animal out during the raid. Poirot asks Rossakoff to order the obedient dog to drop what it is holding in its mouth and it does so. A small sealed packet of cocaine drops to the ground. A shocked Rossakoff loudly proclaims her innocence and Poirot says he believes her – the true criminal is Alice who is in league with Verasco. She carried the drugs in her large skirt pockets and dropped them into her clients' pockets on the dance floor. When the raid occurred and the lights went out temporarily, Poirot was waiting by Cerberus and heard her put the packet in the dog's mouth – and Poirot took the opportunity to cut off a sample of cloth from her sleeve as proof.|$|E
500|$|Currently ranked 2144th in Movies and Television on Amazon.com and 1713th in Film and Television on Amazon.co.uk, the box set {{received}} mixed reviews. Kelly West of Cinema Blend {{noted that}} the [...] "seriously extended episodes" [...] were not significantly expanded, only adding {{a few minutes of}} extra footage, which don't influence the storyline. She also noted a [...] "weakness" [...] in the audio commentary provided by four of the actresses, who she deemed to have been fantastic during the series, describing the features as [...] "random chit-chats". However, she praised Sandra Oh's commentary, noting that <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> most effort in hers by {{trying to come up with}} interest topics, while being [...] "amusing and worth listening to". She described the bonus features as [...] "mildly entertaining", emphasizing Dempsey's interview about his passion for racing cars, which she regarded useless. USA Today had a positive perspective on the box set, by calling it [...] "scintillating" [...] and [...] "addictive".|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to these criticisms, in 1853 Stowe published A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin, an attempt to document the veracity of the novel's depiction of slavery. In the book, Stowe discusses each of the major characters in Uncle Tom's Cabin and cites [...] "real life equivalents" [...] to them while also mounting a more [...] "aggressive attack on slavery in the South than the novel itself had." [...] Like the novel, A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin was a best-seller. However, while Stowe claimed A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin documented her previously consulted sources, she actually read many of the cited works only {{after the publication of}} her novel. [...] A major part of the Key was Stowe's critique of how the legal system supported slavery and licensed owners' mistreatment of slaves. Thus, Stowe put more than slavery on trial; <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> law on trial. This continued an important theme of Uncle Tom's Cabin—that the shadow of law brooded over the institution of slavery and allowed owners to mistreat slaves and then avoid punishment for their mistreatment. In some cases, as Stowe pointed out, it even prevented kind owners from freeing their slaves.|$|E

2500|$|Hooks' {{teaching}} career began in 1976 as an English professor and senior lecturer in Ethnic Studies at the University of Southern California. During her three years there, Golemics, a Los Angeles publisher, released her first published work, a chapbook of poems titled [...] "And There We Wept" [...] (1978), written under her pen name, [...] "bell hooks". She adopted her maternal great-grandmother's {{name as a}} pen name because her great-grandmother [...] "was known for her snappy and bold tongue, which [...] greatly admired". <b>She</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> name in lowercase letters [...] "to distinguish [...] her great-grandmother." [...] She said that her unconventional lowercasing of her name signifies {{what is most important}} is her works: the [...] "substance of books, not who I am." ...|$|E
2500|$|Anna Brun noticed Marie taking {{white powder}} from her {{malachite}} box and stirring {{it into the}} eggnog. When asked, Marie said it was [...] "orange-blossom sugar". But Anna's suspicions were aroused when she noticed a few white flakes floating {{on the surface of}} the eggnog after the patient took a few sips. She showed the glass to Dr. Massénat; he tasted the eggnog and experienced a burning sensation, but attributed the flakes to some ceiling plaster that may have fallen in the glass. Anna was not convinced; <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> rest of the eggnog in a cupboard and kept a close eye on Marie. She saw Marie stir more white powder into some soup for Charles. Again, Charles felt violently ill after a few sips. Anna took the cup of soup away and mustered enough courage to tell Charles's relatives of her suspicions.|$|E

2500|$|The damage {{occurred}} {{when she was}} flying a mission over Baghdad on April 7, 2003. [...] "We did our job with the guys there on the ground, and as {{we were on our}} way out is when I felt the jet get hit. It was pretty obvious — it was loud... I lost all hydraulics instantaneously, and the jet rolled left and pointed toward the ground, which was an uncomfortable feeling over Baghdad. It didn't respond to any of my control inputs." [...] She tried several procedures to get the aircraft under control, none of which worked; last, <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> plane into manual reversion, meaning she was flying the aircraft without hydraulics. The aircraft immediately responded. [...] "The jet started climbing away from the ground, which was a good feeling because there was no way I wanted to eject over Baghdad." [...] With some technical advice from her flight leader, Lieutenant Colonel Turner, she flew the injured plane for an hour back to the air base. [...] "The jet was performing exceptionally well. I had no doubt in my mind I was going to land that airplane." [...] Landing was tricky: [...] "When you lose all the hydraulics, you don't have speed brakes, you don't have brakes, and you don't have steering." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sue is {{initially}} presented as the glee club's [...] "arch-nemesis". Following the pilot episode, Lynch {{said she is}} [...] "pure evil and doesn't hide it", explaining that she was created {{as a product of}} Murphy, Brennan and Falchuk's [...] "inner mean girl". Lynch feels that Sue has the ability to be both [...] "horrible and really delightful at the same time", assessing that she continually speaks her mind as she enjoys appalling people with the things she says. She encapsulates Sue's world view as being about [...] "power and winning", stating that she will do anything to win. Sue's softer side manifests following the revelation that her sister has Down syndrome. She is depicted as kind and loving towards Jean, though Lynch stated that exploration of Sue's humanity would be limited. Sue is an atheist, but according to Murphy, does not want to be. He explained, [...] "She [...] saying to the world, 'Prove [...] wrong: If God is kindness and love, make me believe in God.'" [...] The second-season episode [...] "Grilled Cheesus" [...] focuses on the characters' differing approaches to religion. Sue lobbies against the performance of spiritual songs in school, engaging in a philosophical argument on the matter with school guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), which Murphy describes as the scene he is [...] "most proud to have been involved with in [...] entire career." [...] On the fifth-season episode [...] "Puppet Master", the reason behind Sue's track suit outfit was revealed. It was because she felt that she never received the respect she deserved as a teacher and even the then Principal Figgins [...] "insulted" [...] her and said that she was a cheerleading coach so she needed to [...] "try some pants" [...] because she was wearing an office skirt and that she had long hair. She said that the moment <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> track suit on, [...] "the world bowed before her" [...] and that she [...] "had one made in every color".|$|E
