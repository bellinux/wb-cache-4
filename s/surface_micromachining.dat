50|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>micromachining</b> uses layers {{deposited}} {{on the surface}} of a substrate as the structural materials, rather than using the substrate itself. <b>Surface</b> <b>micromachining</b> was created in the late 1980s to render micromachining of silicon more compatible with planar integrated circuit technology, with the goal of combining MEMS and integrated circuits on the same silicon wafer. The original <b>surface</b> <b>micromachining</b> concept was based on thin polycrystalline silicon layers patterned as movable mechanical structures and released by sacrificial etching of the underlying oxide layer. Interdigital comb electrodes were used to produce in-plane forces and to detect in-plane movement capacitively. This MEMS paradigm has enabled the manufacturing of low cost accelerometers for e.g. automotive air-bag systems and other applications where low performance and/or high g-ranges are sufficient. Analog Devices has pioneered the industrialization of <b>surface</b> <b>micromachining</b> and has realized the co-integration of MEMS and integrated circuits.|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that the {{dissipative}} damping force due to the air film trapped between the bottom of <b>surface</b> <b>micromachined</b> resonators and the substrate on which they are fabricated decreases in magnitude as the separation between the two increases. In order to further investigate this effect and compare experimental findings with theory, a new test device that enables modulation of the damping interaction between a <b>surface</b> <b>micromachined</b> resonator and the substrate has been fabricated. The device, fabricated by the PolyMUMPs process, consists of a <b>surface</b> <b>micromachined</b> polysilicon microresonator, which is elevated {{out of the plane}} of the substrate with the assistance of a bimorph beam. The resonator-to-substrate separation of the elevated resonator can be varied by changing the temperature of the bimorph beam. Q factors for different separations have been measured.
