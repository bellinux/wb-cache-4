The <b>Stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life</b> is a {{meditation}} on the artist's own mortality, depicting five ships at various distances from the shore. The foreground similarly shows five figures at different <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although most of {{the figures}} are generic {{representations}} of human forms in various walks and <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> Taft included himself, {{with one of his}} assistants following him, along {{the west side of the}} sculpture. He is portrayed wearing a smock, with his head bowed and hands clasped behind his back. His daughters served as models for some of the figures.|$|E
5|$|Five {{important}} Upanishad texts, {{according to}} Olivelle – the Jabala plus the Aruni, Laghu-Samnyasa, Kathashruti and Paramahamsa Upanishads – provide different {{answers to the}} question of when someone may renounce the worldly life to lead a monastic one. The Laghu-Samnyasa Upanishad, Kathashruti Upanishad and Paramahamsa Upanishad suggest that a man may renounce after sequentially completing the student, householder and retirement <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> and then getting the consent of his elders and direct family members. In contrast, the Jabala Upanishad and Aruni Upanishad assert that the choice is entirely up to the individual, without needing to have completed any stage of life nor requiring the consent of anyone else.|$|E
50|$|Dragonflies, {{including}} Plathemis lydia, {{spend most}} <b>of</b> their <b>life</b> cycle as aquatic larvae or nypmphs, during {{which there is}} up to a 99.9% mortality rate. The two most common sources of mortality during the aquatic <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> are predation and desiccation. Plathemis lydia then enter the adult <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> which only lasts a few weeks. During the adult <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> Plathemis lydia mate and select suitable sites to deposit their eggs.|$|R
50|$|The {{graduation}} from Brahmacharya <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> {{was marked by}} the Samavartanam ceremony. The graduate was then ready to either start Grihastha (householder) <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> or wait, or pursue a <b>life</b> <b>of</b> Sannyasa and solitude like Rishis in forest. Vyasa in Chapter 234 of Shanti Parva in the Mahabharata praises Brahmacharya as an important <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> necessary for learning, then adds Grihastha stage as the root of society and important to an individual's success.|$|R
50|$|In Indian traditions, Grihastha <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is a recommendation, {{but not a}} requirement. Any Brahmacharya may, {{if he or she}} wants, skip householder and {{retirement}} stage, go straight to Sannyasa <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> thereby renouncing worldly and materialistic pursuits and dedicating their lives to spiritual pursuits.|$|R
5|$|Friedrich was a {{prolific}} artist who {{produced more than}} 500 attributed works. In line with the Romantic ideals of his time, he intended his paintings to function as pure aesthetic statements, so he was cautious that the titles given to his work were not overly descriptive or evocative. It is likely that some of today's more literal titles, such as The <b>Stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life,</b> were not given by the artist himself, but were instead adopted {{during one of the}} revivals of interest in Friedrich. Complications arise when dating Friedrich's work, in part because he often did not directly name or date his canvases. He kept a carefully detailed notebook on his output, however, which has been used by scholars to tie paintings to their completion dates.|$|E
5|$|In the Vedic-era literature, {{only three}} ashramas (life stages) were mentioned, with Brahmacharya (student) {{as the first}} stage and the Grihastha (householder) as the second stage. The third stage of life, in the Vedic texts, {{combined}} Vanaprastha (retired or forest dweller) and Sannyasa (renunciation) as one ashrama. According to Soti Shivendra Chandra, a scholar at the Rohilkhand University, the separation of Vanaprastha and Sannyasa as two different <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is first mentioned in the Jabala Upanishad. However, Patrick Olivelle, {{a professor at the}} University of Texas at Austin, states that the Sannyasa ashrama as a separate stage is mentioned in Aruni Upanishad, which likely is a more ancient Upanishad.|$|E
5|$|While most temnospondyls are aquatic {{in early}} <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> most metoposaurids {{appear to have}} been {{terrestrial}} in their juvenile stage. Like other Mesozoic temnospondyls, adult metoposaurids were adapted to a semiaquatic lifestyle. Their bones are not highly developed for movement on land. The cross-sectional thickness of limb bones in adult metoposaurids shows that they could not withstand the stress of terrestrial locomotion. Juvenile individuals have bones that are thick enough to withstand this stress, and could probably move about on land. To maintain a terrestrial lifestyle, a temnospondyl's limb bones would have to thicken with positive allometry, meaning that they would grow at a greater rate {{than the rest of the}} body. This is not the case in metoposaurids, meaning that as their bodies grew larger they became less adapted toward a terrestrial lifestyle.|$|E

50|$|The Crisis {{discusses}} the <b>life</b> <b>of</b> a young actress' metamorphosis into a mature refined woman. When the actress first starts {{out in her}} career she is admired for her beauty, youthfulness, and novelty. Years later, although these accidental attributes are fading, she is still a talented actress, and she now possesses the experience and reflection needed for a truly aesthetic performance. The theme revolves around the transitions from the aesthetic <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> to the ethical <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> and how {{a person in the}} ethical <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is still capable of aesthetic enjoyment.|$|R
5000|$|The stage [...] "Grihastha" [...] is {{preceded by}} Brahmacharya (student) <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> and {{followed}} by Vanaprastha (retirement, forest dweller, still an advisor to the next generation) stage. In ancient texts, Grihastha <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is said to extend {{from the age of}} about 25 to about 50.|$|R
5|$|At the {{prenatal}} and neonatal <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> {{the presence}} of antibodies is provided by passive immunization from the mother. Early endogenous antibody production varies for different kinds of antibodies, and usually appear within {{the first years of}} life. Since antibodies exist freely in the bloodstream, they are said {{to be part of the}} humoral immune system. Circulating antibodies are produced by clonal B cells that specifically respond to only one antigen (an example is a virus capsid protein fragment). Antibodies contribute to immunity in three ways: They prevent pathogens from entering or damaging cells by binding to them; they stimulate removal of pathogens by macrophages and other cells by coating the pathogen; and they trigger destruction of pathogens by stimulating other immune responses such as the complement pathway. Antibodies will also trigger vasoactive amine degranulation to contribute to immunity against certain types of antigens (helminths, allergens).|$|E
25|$|In {{analysing}} {{the results}} of the investigation he found that people at certain <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> for example in old age and early childhood, {{were more likely to be}} in abject poverty, living below the poverty line, than at other <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> From this he formulated the idea of the poverty cycle in which some people moved in and out of absolute poverty during their lives.|$|E

25|$|Lopez and Ruzikah (1983) found that, {{when given}} the same {{resources}}, women tend to outlive men at all <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> after infancy.

25|$|In Sikh thought, Hell and Heaven are not {{places for}} living hereafter, {{they are part}} of spiritual {{topography}} of man and do not exist otherwise. They refer to good and evil <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> respectively and can be lived now and here during our earthly existence. For example, Guru Arjan explains that people who are entangled in emotional attachment and doubt are living in hell on this Earth i.e. their life is hellish.|$|E

5|$|Yajnavalkya {{answers that}} one may {{complete}} Brahmacharya (the student <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>life),</b> then Grihastha (householder), followed by Vanaprastha (retirement) and finally Sannyasa (pilgrimage as Parivrajaka Bhikshu, renunciation). Or, continues Yajnavalkya, one may renounce immediately {{after completing the}} student <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> or after the householder <b>stage,</b> regardless <b>of</b> whether or not one has completed the sacred fire ritual or any other rituals. Olivelle interprets the sacred fire ritual reference as an indirect reference to marriage, and thus the text asserts {{that those who have}} married or never married can both renounce. The Jabala Upanishad herein recommends that a person may renounce on the day he feels detached from the world, regardless <b>of</b> which <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> he is in, and whether he has completed that stage.|$|R

25|$|In one context, brahmacharya is {{the first}} of four ashrama (age-based stages) of a human life, with grihastha (householder), vanaprastha (forest dweller), and sannyasa (renunciation) being the other three asramas. The brahmacharya (bachelor student) stage of one's life, up to twenty-five years of age, was focused on {{education}} and included the practice of celibacy. In this context, it connotes chastity during the student stage of life for the purposes of learning from a guru (teacher), and during later <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> for the purposes of attaining spiritual liberation (moksha).|$|E
25|$|Western {{vegetarian}} diets {{are typically}} high in carotenoids, but relatively low in {{omega-3 fatty acids}} and vitamin B12. Vegans can have particularly low intake of vitamin B and calcium {{if they do not}} eat enough items such as collard greens, leafy greens, tempeh and tofu (soy). High levels of dietary fiber, folic acid, vitamins C and E, and magnesium, and low consumption of saturated fat are all considered to be beneficial aspects of a vegetarian diet. A well planned vegetarian diet will provide all nutrients in a meat-eater's diet to the same level for all <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
