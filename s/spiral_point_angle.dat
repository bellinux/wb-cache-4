40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access until 19 th July 2018. Drilling of bone {{is a common}} {{surgical}} procedure in orthopedics to produce holes for screw insertion. The force and temperature rise in bone drilling are two important factors affecting {{the outcome of the}} process. The present work attempts to investigate the effect of drill <b>point</b> <b>angle</b> on the level of force and temperature in bone in the presence of ultrasonic vibrations imposed on the drill along the drilling direction. The effect of drill speed on the drilling force and bone temperature was studied using two types of drills with different <b>point</b> <b>angles.</b> The influence of a range of ultrasonic frequencies and amplitudes of vibrations on drilling force, torque and surface temperature of bone was also investigated. The drilling force and bone temperature were found to be strongly influenced by the drill <b>point</b> <b>angle</b> in the presence of ultrasonic vibrations. The drill with larger <b>point</b> <b>angle</b> caused more force and temperature compared to the drill with smaller <b>point</b> <b>angle.</b> Ultrasonic frequency above 15 kHz was observed to produce more temperature in bone for both types of drill geometries.

(2) As to the torque and thrust, similar tedencies were seen. The influence of feeding speed was great, growing greater approximately in proportion to the feeding speed, while it also grew greater in proportion to the increase of the cutting speed, the cutting resistance revealing its minimum around the speed of 20 m/min regardless the variety of feeding speed. (3) The larger the <b>point</b> <b>angle</b> is, the greater is the torque and thrust and is the cutting temperature, so the feeding should be made small when the <b>point</b> <b>angle</b> is fixed large． (4) The form of chips is good at the feeding speed of 0. 1 /rev, revealing the form of flow type chips, especially it is most ideal at 180 °. At the feeding speed of 0. 2 mm/rev and at the increase speed of 30 m/min and onwards, tear type chips are to be seen produced, resulting the increase of the cutting temperature and of the cutting resistance．(5) In the drilling operation, the quality of forms of chips and of flow of chips will influence greatly upon the cutting temperature and the cutting resistance, accordingly it is most essential for thｅ sake of tools lives and for the economy of cutting power, to fix the cutting condition, observing the forms of chips and flowing patterns of chips...|$|R
