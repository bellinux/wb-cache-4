40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{a method for}} temporally <b>synchronising</b> image sequences of human body movement. The idea is based on matching similar moving objects in two video sequences to <b>synchronise</b> using temporal features. We describe the experiment with real-time image sequences of human movement skills, being “summersaults ” in this case study. Based on two principle motion features—the centre of mass and the principal axis—calculated from movement sequences, we discuss a detailed implementation, measurement {{of the difference between}} two moving objects, performance, and limitations of the proposed algorithm. The results indicate that the temporal <b>synchronising</b> algorithm proposed is useful for <b>synchronising</b> the movement of objects in video sequences...|$|R
50|$|A {{multisync}} monitor or multiscan monitor is {{a monitor}} that can properly <b>synchronise</b> with various {{horizontal and vertical}} scan frequencies. In contrast, fixed frequency monitors can only <b>synchronise</b> with a specific horizontal and vertical frequency, limiting their flexibility.|$|R
5|$|The air sacs, which hold air, do not {{contribute}} much to gas exchange, despite being thin-walled, {{as they are}} poorly vascularised. The air sacs expand and contract due {{to changes in the}} volume in the thorax and abdomen. This volume change is caused by the movement of the sternum and ribs and this movement is often <b>synchronised</b> with movement of the flight muscles.|$|E
5|$|Trillium grandiflorum is {{most common}} in rich, mixed upland forests. It is easily {{recognised}} by its attractive three-petaled white flowers, opening from late spring to early summer, that rise above a whorl of three, leaf-like bracts. It {{is an example of}} a spring ephemeral, a plant whose life-cycle is <b>synchronised</b> with that of the deciduous woodland which it favours.|$|E
5|$|Although figs flower asynchronously as a population, in {{most species}} {{flowering}} is <b>synchronised</b> within an individual. Newly emerged female wasps must {{move away from}} their natal tree {{in order to find}} figs in which to lay their eggs. This is to the advantage of the fig, since it prevents self-pollination. In Florida, individual F. aurea trees flower and fruit asynchronously. Within-tree asynchrony in flowering is likely to raise the probability of self-pollination, but it may be an adaptation that allows the species to maintain an adequate population of wasps at low population densities or in strongly seasonal climates.|$|E

5|$|Chaplin {{developed}} {{a passion for}} music {{as a child and}} taught himself to play the piano, violin, and cello. He considered the musical accompaniment of a film to be important, and from A Woman of Paris onwards he took an increasing interest in this area. With the advent of sound technology, Chaplin began using a <b>synchronised</b> orchestral soundtrack – composed by himself – for City Lights (1931). He thereafter composed the scores for all of his films, and from the late 1950s to his death, he scored all of his silent features and some of his short films.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{military}} and political weakness, during his rule Bulgaria remained a major cultural center and the ideas of Hesychasm dominated the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. Patriarch Evtimiy of Tarnovo became the most prominent cultural figure of the country. A number of texts were written or translated and an orthographic reform of the Bulgarian language was issued with <b>synchronised</b> rules. After the fall of Bulgaria, a number of scholars found refuge in the other Orthodox countries and brought {{the achievements of the}} Bulgarian culture to them.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, Western Electric, the {{manufacturing}} division of AT, acquired {{the rights to}} the de Forest audion, the forerunner of the triode vacuum tube. Over the next few years they developed it into a predictable and reliable device that made electronic amplification possible for the first time. Western Electric then branched-out into developing uses for the vacuum tube including public address systems and an electrical recording system for the recording industry. Beginning in 1922, the research branch of Western Electric began working intensively on recording technology for both sound-on-disc and sound-on film <b>synchronised</b> sound systems for motion-pictures.|$|E

5|$|Many teleosts form shoals, {{which serve}} {{multiple}} purposes in different species. Schooling is sometimes an antipredator adaptation, offering improved vigilance against predators. It {{is often more}} efficient to gather food by working as a group, and individual fish optimise their strategies by choosing to join or leave a shoal. When a predator has been noticed, prey fish respond defensively, resulting in collective shoal behaviours such as <b>synchronised</b> movements. Responses do not consist only of attempting to hide or flee; antipredator tactics include for example scattering and reassembling. Fish also aggregate in shoals to spawn.|$|E
5|$|S.E.5 no. A4850, {{fresh from}} its packing crate, was {{extensively}} modified for Ball: in particular {{he had the}} <b>synchronised</b> Vickers machine gun removed, to be replaced with a second Lewis gun fitted to fire downwards through {{the floor of the}} cockpit. He also had a slightly larger fuel tank installed. On 9 April, A4850 was refitted, and the downward-firing Lewis gun removed and replaced by the normal Vickers gun mounting. In a letter to Flora Young on 18 April, Ball mentioned getting his own hut on the flight line, and installing the members of his flight nearby.|$|E
5|$|The film {{received}} widespread critical acclaim. It {{pioneered the}} new wave cinema movement in Malayalam cinema {{and became one of}} the first Malayalam films to use <b>synchronised</b> sound and outdoor locales. The film also became the first Indian film to use sound as a leitmotif. It was shown at various film festivals around the world, and won four National Film Awards at the 20th National Film Awards in 1973, including Best Feature Film, Best Director for Gopalakrishnan, and Best Actress for Sharada.|$|E

5|$|The {{repertoire}} of behaviour involves <b>synchronised</b> performances of various actions such as preening, pointing, calling, bill clacking, staring, and combinations of such behaviours (like the sky-call). When a bird first {{returns to the}} colony it will dance with many partners, but {{after a number of}} years the number of birds an individual will interact with drops, until one partner is chosen and a pair is formed. They then continue to perfect an individual language that will eventually be unique to that one pair. Having established a pair bond that will last for life, however, most of that dance will never be used again.|$|E
5|$|The {{third stage}} of Zeppelin {{involved}} a delay until 21 May, {{on the basis}} that the Soviets had asked for them to be <b>synchronised</b> with their own invasion plans. This ran from 21 April until 9 May, when a major revision to the plans (stage four) was introduced. The Twelfth Army and Polish forces would land in Albania and Croatia, bypassing Greece due to mutiny within Allied Greek forces in Africa, with an invasion set in June. A major invasion of Southern France was also added, codenamed Vendetta.|$|E
5|$|The thorax {{has three}} segments, {{each with a}} pair of robust legs, and a pair of {{membranous}} wings on the hind two segments. The front legs of corbiculate bees bear combs for cleaning the antennae, and in many species the hind legs bear pollen baskets, flattened sections with incurving hairs to secure the collected pollen. The wings are <b>synchronised</b> in flight and the somewhat smaller hind wings connect to the forewings by a row of hooks along their margin which connect to a groove in the forewing. The abdomen has nine segments, the hindermost three being modified into the sting.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{financial}} crises, {{it took more}} than one and a half years for Gopalakrishnan to finish the film. Swayamvaram {{was one of the first}} Malayalam films to use <b>synchronised</b> sound and to be filmed in outdoor locales, for which Gopalakrishnan used his Nagra audio recorder. The film was shot in two schedules. It was delayed due to scheduling conflicts of the lead actress, Sharada. She was working in several films at that time, so Gopalakrishnan had to arrange the schedule to suit her convenience. The lead actor, Madhu, mentioned in an interview that Gopalakrishnan was clear about his characters and their behaviour. Gopalakrishnan also used to discuss the shoot with his crew before the shooting.|$|E
5|$|In late 1203, John {{attempted}} to relieve Château Gaillard, which although besieged by Philip was guarding the eastern flank of Normandy. John attempted a <b>synchronised</b> operation involving land-based and water-borne forces, considered by most historians today {{to have been}} imaginative in conception, but overly complex for forces of the period to have carried out successfully. John's relief operation was blocked by Philip's forces, and John turned back to Brittany {{in an attempt to}} draw Philip away from eastern Normandy. John successfully devastated much of Brittany, but did not deflect Philip's main thrust into the east of Normandy. Opinions vary amongst historians as to the military skill shown by John during this campaign, with most recent historians arguing that his performance was passable, although not impressive.|$|E
5|$|In {{works from}} Jeux vénitiens, Lutosławski wrote long {{passages}} {{in which the}} parts of the ensemble are not to be <b>synchronised</b> exactly. At cues from the conductor each instrumentalist may be instructed to move straight on to the next section, to finish their current section before moving on, or to stop. In this way the random elements within compositionally controlled limits defined by the term aleatory are carefully directed by the composer, who controls the architecture and harmonic progression of the piece precisely. Lutosławski notated the music exactly; there is no improvisation, no choice of parts is given to any instrumentalist, and there is thus no doubt about how the musical performance is to be realised.|$|E
