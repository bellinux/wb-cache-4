Different types of <b>sintered</b> materials; chromium molybdenum (SCM) <b>sintered</b> material and maraging steel (MAS) <b>sintered</b> material were fabricated by using {{selective laser melting}} (SLM) method. Measurement of cutting force and cutting temperature were carried out by using ball end mill {{in order to understand}} the influence of different hardness of <b>sintered</b> materials on machinability. Bulk carbon steel (JIS S 55 C) was selected as reference steel. Experimental results show that MAS <b>sintered</b> material is difficult to machine material where cutting force of MAS <b>sintered</b> material was higher than SCM <b>sintered</b> material. However, even though MAS <b>sintered</b> material has higher hardness than SCM <b>sintered</b> material, cutting temperature was low due to high thermal conductivity. From these results, MAS <b>sintered</b> material can be considered as good material to produce mold due to its high hardness and good machinability...|$|R

For the feed material used in the trials, to obtain <b>sinters</b> with mean softening temperatures above 1050 °C, peak bed temperatures above 1130 °C are required.

The results obtained showed that the methods applied produced accurate results and the preparation method was then applied on all samples that were analyzed. The XRD analyses show that the <b>sinter</b> contains spinel (mainly magnetite with variable Mg), hematite, dicalcium silicate (C 2 S) and silico ferrite of calcium and aluminum (SFCA) and that there are distinct differences between the fine and normal <b>sinter.</b> Fine <b>sinter</b> contains more hematite and less SFCA than normal <b>sinter.</b> The presence of the SFCA is considered to be essential for the production of strong <b>sinter.</b> The XRF analyses show that there are no distinctive differences in the chemistry of fine and normal <b>sinter.</b> The samples were then analyzed with an electron microprobe. It was found that the compositions of some of the SFCA phases present in the samples do not correspond to those described in the literature. Optical microscopy combined with point counting was conducted on the fine and normal <b>sinter</b> in order to determine differences and to compare the point counting data to the XRD results. The point counting results showed that the hematite present in the fine <b>sinter</b> is largely relict or unreacted hematite. <b>Sinter</b> pot test samples were analyzed with XRD and XRF. It was found that the pot test samples exhibited similar trends as the samples taken at the <b>sinter</b> plant. This shows that it is not only plant parameters such as sample transport that result in the formation of fines, but that carbon addition, flame temperature and reaction time may also play a role in the formation of fine <b>sinter</b> material. It has been concluded that the production of fine <b>sinter</b> is a direct function of the amount of hematite present in the <b>sinter.</b> The proposed hypothesis for this phenomenon involves the incomplete reaction of the <b>sinter</b> material during processing. Suggestions to decrease the amount of fine <b>sinter</b> formed include: uniform heat distribution during ignition, pO 2 alteration by reductant addition, lower ignition temperature, regulating the cooling regime and decreasing the grain size of lime.

5000|$|Piranha {{solution}} is particularly useful when cleaning <b>sintered</b> (or [...] "fritted") glassware. The {{size of the}} pores of <b>sintered</b> glassware is critical for its function, so {{it should not be}} cleaned with strong bases, which gradually dissolve the <b>sinter.</b> <b>Sintered</b> glass also tends to capture material deep within the structure, making it difficult to remove.

This is usually accomplished by allowing piranha solution to percolate backward through the <b>sintered</b> glass. Although cleaning <b>sintered</b> glassware will leave it as clean as possible without damaging the glassware it is not recommend due to the risk of explosion.|$|R
5|$|<b>Sintering</b> powders of {{samarium}} oxide and boron, in vacuum, {{yields a}} powder containing several samarium boride phases, and their volume ratio {{can be controlled}} through the mixing proportion. The powder can be converted into larger crystals of a certain samarium boride using arc melting or zone melting techniques, relying on the different melting/crystallization temperature of SmB6 (2580°C), SmB4 (about 2300°C) and SmB66 (2150°C). All these materials are hard, brittle, dark-gray solids with the hardness increasing with the boron content. Samarium diboride is too volatile to be produced with these methods and requires high pressure (about 65 kbar) and low temperatures between 1140 and 1240°C to stabilize its growth. Increasing the temperature results in the preferential formations of SmB6.|$|E

40|$|The <b>sinter</b> {{quality is}} {{dependent}} on <b>sinter</b> mineralogy, which in turn depends on the chemical compositions of the <b>sinter</b> mix. Although many research works have been conducted, further investigation {{on the effect of}} chemical compositions (MgO, A 2 O 3, Basicity) on the <b>sinter</b> quality is still required for further improvement of the <b>sinter</b> and more alternative additives are still being tested. In this project, a <b>sinter</b> pot has been used to manufacture <b>sinters,</b> which were characterized using point-counting to quantify the different phases and X-Ray diffraction to identify the polymorphic forms of Ca 2 SiO 4 of the silicate phases. The produced <b>sinters</b> were evaluated with respect to reducibility index (RI), reduction degradation index (RDI), physical breakdown (TI and AI), and production properties (yield, coke breeze rate and production rate). The influence of ignition temperature, magnesium oxide, alumina addition and basicity on the mineralogy as well as physical and chemical properties of iron ore <b>sinters</b> were investigated. Results were obtained as follows: For the Base case with a basicity of 2, 2. 8 mass% MgO content, 1. 7 mass % Al 2 O 3 and 10 mass% CaO, the effect of ignition temperature, which ranged between 864 oC and 1100 oC, on the <b>sinter</b> quality was investigated. Results showed that the ignition temperature had an effect on the <b>sinter</b> properties: reducibility (RI), physical strength (TI and AI), production properties (yield, coke breeze rate and production rate). The temperature 1053 oC was the best ignition temperature for an economically acceptable <b>sinter.</b> A further increase in ignition temperature was found to form melt {{on the surface of the}} <b>sinter</b> produced, leading to a <b>sinter</b> of low quality. Also, X-rays diffraction pattern showed that the allotropic transformation of the Ca 2 SiO 4 did not take place. The Low SiO 2 – Low Al 2 O 3 <b>sinter</b> had the highest reducibility index and had the highest Abrasion index and the lowest coke breeze rate at 2. 8 mass% MgO content compared to all the <b>sinters</b> produced in this project. For the High SiO 2 – Low Al 2 O 3 <b>sinter</b> MgO was added through dolomite and fused magnesia. A comparative study on the effect of dolomite and fused magnesia was conducted. The <b>sinter</b> to which fused magnesia was added had lower reducibility, higher reduction degradation, higher tumble index, lower abrasion index and lower coke breeze rate than the <b>sinter</b> to which dolomite was added. High SiO 2 – High Al 2 O 3 <b>sinter</b> had the lowest reducibility index, the lowest reduction degradation, the lowest tumbler index and the highest coke breeze rate. The increase in MgO content in all the <b>sinters</b> produced increased the coke breeze rate. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008.
