500|$|By this time, the war {{was closing}} in on the embattled Emperor. A Union of Czech Deputies had already sworn an oath to a new Czechoslovak state {{independent}} of the Habsburg Empire on 13 April 1918, the prestige of the German Army had taken a severe blow at the Battle of Amiens, and, on 25 September 1918, her brother in law King Ferdinand I of Bulgaria broke away from his allies in the Central Powers and sued for peace independently. Zita was with Charles when he received the telegram of Bulgaria's collapse. She remembered it [...] "made it even more urgent to start peace talks with the Western Powers while there was still <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about. On 16 October, the emperor issued a [...] "People's Manifesto" [...] proposing the empire be restructured on federal lines with each nationality gaining its own state. Instead, each nation broke away and the empire effectively dissolved.|$|E

500|$|After {{the season}} finale, Bell talked about Coulson losing his arm, saying that [...] "he paid a price—that was {{important}} to us. You don't mess with {{the forces of nature}} without getting bitten, {{and the fact that he}} literally saved everyone on the ship by that crystal not shattering was a wonderful, heroic thing and showed you that at heart, Coulson is a heroic man whose actions back up his words." [...] Bell also talked about the cliffhanger involving Simmons being absorbed by a Kree monolith: [...] "When we first started talking about the Monolith, we knew that it needed to present a threat and we needed to demonstrate some of that threat and the promise of more story... It's easy to kill a character for shock value or whatever, and we did have a number of deaths this season, but ... we prefer to leave you with <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about, to walk away with. This is something that came up in the room, we talked about what it meant ... The idea of getting Fitz and Simmons—who had been one person—to become two whole people, come back together, agree to go on a date, and then have this happen, felt beautifully poetic".|$|E

2500|$|Ed Brophy, {{director}} of the International Boxing Hall of Fame, noted Camacho's talents in attracting an audience. He said, [...] "Camacho {{brought a lot of}} excitement to boxing.

[...] Brophy also praised Camacho's boxing skills, describing him as [...] "an exciting fighter, and one of the greats. He faced the best, going up and down several divisions." [...] Alfredo R.

2500|$|Immediately {{following}} the incident Timberlake jokingly dismissed it, telling the inquisitive press: [...] " [...] love giving you all <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about." [...] His attitude quickly changed as the scandal {{grew into a}} serious controversy. People Magazine stated Timberlake {{was referred to as}} [...] "the Teflon man" [...] at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards because the incident did not affect him as it did with Jackson. In a 2006 interview with MTV, Timberlake said that compared to the huge backlash Jackson suffered, he himself received only about 10% of the blame; and he accused American society of being both [...] "harsher on women" [...] and [...] "unfairly harsh on ethnic people". Prior to plans for the Super Bowl performance, Jackson and Timberlake had discussed potentially recording a duet for Jackson's Damita Jo album, as well as a rumored collaboration for a Quincy Jones album, though neither came to fruition. In November 2013, Timberlake performed a cover of Jackson's [...] "Let's Wait Awhile" [...] on The 20/20 Experience World Tour before transitioning into his song [...] "Until the End of Time", which was regarded as a sign of affection or apology to Jackson.|$|E

6000|$|... "Musgrave's friends {{believe in}} him," [...] Don Arturo replied. [...] "But we must {{remember}} that caution is sometimes useful and the lad is young. I would sooner his promotion was gradual. But we have <b>something</b> else <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about." ...|$|R
2500|$|Many of {{her music}} videos were shot as short films {{exploring}} {{issues such as}} love triangles, abuse, and substance abuse romance, including [...] "We Found Love" [...] and [...] "Man Down". Her music video for [...] "Umbrella" [...] shows Rihanna's transition into adulthood and her newly adopted image. The [...] "dark, creepy" [...] scenes of [...] "Disturbia" [...] have been compared to Michael Jackson's Thriller. The video for [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] features Rihanna in a padded room playing a game of russian roulette with her partner. A scene of Rihanna being approached by a speeding car at night was compared to the altercation with Chris Brown. The Caribbean-inspired music video for [...] "Rude Boy" [...] was compared to rapper M.I.A.'s video [...] "Boyz" [...] by many critics for its colorful aesthetic similarities. In 2011, she released three controversial music videos about sadomasochism, rape, and domestic violence. [...] "Man Down", which features Rihanna shooting {{a man in a}} train station, was criticized by the Parents Television Council. [...] "We Found Love", which shows Rihanna and her love interest in a drug-filled unhealthy relationship, sparked criticism from the Rape Crisis Centre for its inappropriate message. But Charne Graham of the Houston Press defended the singer, asking, [...] "Why should Rihanna's music videos get everyone riled up when others' equally sexual and controversial videos are in rotation? [...] she just like to make music videos that give us <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about." [...] She is the first woman to pass two billion cumulative views on the music video website VEVO. As of December 2016, she has accumulated over 10 billion views on the site. Her VEVO YouTube channel is currently the fifth most subscribed channel on YouTube.|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{following}} the incident, Timberlake sounded unapologetic for his actions, telling Access Hollywood, [...] "Hey man, we love giving you all <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about." [...] Timberlake {{released a statement}} saying [...] "I am sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl. It was not intentional and is regrettable." [...] However, Timberlake was not required to film a video apology as Jackson was. Timberlake also addressed the incident at the Grammy Awards the following week, which Jackson was banned from attending after being scheduled as a presenter, saying [...] "I know it's been a rough week on everybody. What occurred was unintentional, completely regrettable and I apologize if you guys are offended." [...] Timberlake gave an additional interview at the Grammy event and stated, [...] "All I could say was, 'Oh, my God. Oh, my God,'" [...] Timberlake said. [...] "I looked at her. They brought a towel up on stage. They covered her up. I was completely embarrassed and just walked off the stage as quickly as I could. I'm frustrated at the whole situation. I'm frustrated that my character is being questioned. And {{the fact of the}} matter is, you know, I've had a good year, a really good year, especially with my music." [...] Timberlake later declared, [...] "It was something that went wrong. Then I felt like, I'm going to show everyone that this was something that didn't affect me, and I'm going to show up at the Grammys." [...] He later said he was unable to attend most of the halftime rehearsals due to being on tour in Spain, having only one day to rehearse. While promoting his sophomore album FutureSex/LoveSounds over two years later, Timberlake expressed regret for his behavior, saying, [...] "In my honest opinion now ... I could've handled it better. ... I'm part of a community that consider themselves artists. And if there was something I could have done in her defense that was more than I realized then, I would have. But the other half of me was like, 'Wow. We still haven't found the weapons of mass destruction and everybody cares about this!'" [...] He added, [...] "I probably got 10 percent of the blame, and that says something about society ... I think that America's harsher on women. And I think that America is, you know, unfairly harsh on ethnic people." ...|$|E
