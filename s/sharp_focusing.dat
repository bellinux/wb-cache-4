50|$|The {{heart of}} the {{telescope}} is an f/1.0 honeycombed construction, borosilicate primary mirror. The VATT's mirror is unusually 'fast', f/1, which means that its focal distance is equal to its diameter. Because it has such a short focal length, a Gregorian design could be employed which uses a concave secondary mirror at a point beyond the primary focus; this allows unusually <b>sharp</b> <b>focusing</b> across the field of view.|$|E
50|$|The device {{operates}} using {{a cutting}} action of an infrared laser. As the laser emits a radiation {{in the near}} infrared, in this wavelength regime the laser can interact with biological materials. Through <b>sharp</b> <b>focusing</b> of the probe within the sample, a focal point of very high intensity, up to TW/cm2, can be achieved. Through the non-linear interaction of the optical penetration in the focal region a material separation in {{a process known as}} photo-disruption is introduced. By limiting the laser pulse durations to the femtoseconds range, the energy expended at the target region is precisely controlled, thereby limiting the interaction zone of the cut to under a micrometre. External to this zone the ultra-short beam application time introduces minimal to no thermal damage to the remainder of the sample.|$|E

For use with a Leica IIIa RF and the Leitz 20 cm f/4.5 Telyt or 40 cm f/5 Telyt long focus lenses (all Germany). Long focus (and telephoto) lenses have very shallow {{depth of field}} and the short baseline rangefinders built into RF cameras cannot triangulate the subject distance accurately enough for acceptably <b>sharp</b> <b>focusing.</b> SLRs do not suffer from this problem, because they are focused by directly assessing the sharpness of the lens image - the lens serves as its own rangefinder. Reflex housings converted RFs into very awkward SLRs by inserting a reflex mirror and focusing screen between the lens and camera. Some even had image reversing optics. They also solved the RF camera's parallax error problem in macrophotography. Eventually, real SLRs were recognized as the simpler solution and supplanted RFs in the 1960s. The last reflex housing for a film camera, the Leica Visoflex III (West Germany; for Leica M4 series RFs), was discontinued in 1984.|$|E

50|$|The axis of {{the lens}} is {{normally}} perpendicular to the film (or sensor). Changing the angle between axis and film by tilting the lens standard backwards or forwards is called lens tilt, or just tilt. Tilt is especially useful in landscape photography. By using the Scheimpflug principle, the “plane of sharp focus” can be changed so that any plane can be brought into <b>sharp</b> <b>focus.</b> When the film plane and lens plane are parallel {{as is the case}} for most 35 mm cameras, the plane of <b>sharp</b> <b>focus</b> is also parallel to these two planes. If, however, the lens plane is tilted with respect to the film plane, the plane of <b>sharp</b> <b>focus</b> is also tilted according to geometrical and optical properties. The three planes intersect in a line below the camera for downward lens tilt. The tilted plane of <b>sharp</b> <b>focus</b> is useful, in that this plane can be made to coincide with a near and far object. Thus, both near and far objects on the plane are in focus.|$|R

We study circular, flat lenses composed of perforated air channels. The geometry is similar to binary Fresnel lenses, and the lenses exploit several resonance mechanisms to enhance the transmission, such as Fabry–Perot resonances in the channels and cavity resonances on the lens surface. The proposed lenses are able to transmit up to 83 % of the incident energy and generate <b>sharp</b> <b>focusing</b> with very high amplification (up to 16 [*]dB experimentally).

40|$|Tuning {{effect of}} {{different}} polarization states {{was presented in}} this paper. It can be realized by a plasmonic lens constructed with elliptical pinholes ranging from submicron to nanoscales distributed in variant period along radial direction. Propagation properties of the lens illuminated under four different polarization states: linear, elliptical, radial, and cylindrical vector beam, were calculated and analyzed combining with finite-difference time-domain algorithm. Different focusing performances of the lens were illustrated while the polarized light passes through the pinholes. Our calculation results demonstrate that polarization effect of the elliptical pinholes-based plasmonic lens can generate high transmission intensity and <b>sharp</b> <b>focusing</b> for our proposed specific structures.

SD-OCPM is an interferometric microscope capable of quantitative measurement of amplitude and phase of scattered light with high phase stability. Field-based dynamic light scattering (F-DLS) analysis allows for direct evaluation of complex-valued field autocorrelation function and measurement of localized diffusive and directional dynamic properties of biological and material samples with high spatial resolution.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to harness webcam {{technology}} for the biological monitoring of grassland plants, a Microsoft LifeCam-based photogrammetric system was developed for the remote capture of 3 D measurements of plants.

This paper presents {{the details of a}} qualitative evaluation of a LifeCam VX- 3000 for indoor and outdoor photogrammetric measurement together with the results of a case study involving two common small grassland plants. In the evaluation, laboratory and in-situ principal distance (PD) determination techniques were performed, thus evaluating the significance of the latter for improving measurement accuracy in an uncontrolled environment despite the ineffective focusing of this imaging sensor. The effect of outdoor ambient temperature on the PD was investigated. Results show that <b>sharp</b> <b>focusing</b> is a problem with this webcam, as shown by the disparity of the laboratory-determined PD of various object distances.

30|$|The MSI images {{presented}} in this paper were acquired with a Nikon D 800 DSLR (36 MP, CMOS sensor) digital camera modified for “full spectrum”, ultraviolet–visible‒infrared photography (between about 360 and 1100  nm). The CMOS sensor responds both to the near infrared and near ultraviolet ranges of the spectrum, however manufacturers install an IR cut-off filter in front of the sensor to reduce infrared transmission. There are companies that will remove this filter in commercial cameras for a small fee, and then the camera is said to be “full spectrum”. The camera is tethered to a computer to allow <b>sharp</b> <b>focusing</b> in non‒visible modes (IR and UV) using live view mode. The MSI images created with this camera do not precisely image the same area in each waveband because it is necessary to refocus the lens at the different wavelengths. In order to allow a comparative examination through the different spectral ranges, those images are uploaded as layers of a single document file in an image editing software, such as Adobe Photoshop or GIMP, and manually resized to overlap one another. Infrared Reflectography (IRR) was performed with an InGaAs camera (320 × 256 pixels) Merlin NIR by Indigo Systems. Some suggested references on art documentation and examination using each spectral band and the relative instrumentation for Infrared [1, 2, 20 – 23] and Ultraviolet [24, 25] are given.|$|E

40|$|Recently, Lemoult et al (2011 Phys. Rev. Lett. 107 064301) used time {{reversal}} {{to focus}} sound above {{an array of}} soda cans into a spot {{much smaller than the}} acoustic wavelength in air. In this study, we show that equally <b>sharp</b> <b>focusing</b> can be achieved without time reversal, by arranging transducers around a nearly circular array of soda cans. The size of the focal spot {{at the center of the}} array is made progressively smaller as the frequency approaches the Helmholtz resonance frequency of a can from below, and, near the resonance, becomes smaller than the size of a single can. We show that the locally resonant metamaterial formed by soda cans supports a guided wave at frequencies below the Helmholtz resonance frequency. The small focal spot results from a small wavelength of this guided wave near the resonance in combination with a near field effect making the acoustic field concentrate at the opening of a can. The focusing is achieved with propagating rather than evanescent waves. No sub-diffraction-limited focusing is observed if the diffraction limit is defined with respect to the wavelength of the guided mode in the metamaterial medium rather than the wavelength of the bulk wave in air.

40|$|In light microscopy, {{the spatial}} {{transverse}} resolution {{is a function}} of the wavelength and numerical aperture. The depth resolution is another function of these parameters. The factors that enable the detection of fine detail, make the <b>sharp</b> <b>focusing</b> of more than a thin slice of the depth in an object impossible. When the examination of fracture surfaces is attempted using light reflection microscopy, the roughness will often restrict the in-focus parts of an image to a small portion of the field of view. Several authors have presented methods that enable a set of digitised images to be processed into a single composite image which contains the in-focus parts from each image. These methods are effective, unfortunately the noise present in each digital image is accumulated, resulting in increasingly noisy composite images as the number of images in a set is increased. During processing, a separate image depicting the heights in the surface, i. e. a contour map, may be produced. This image is the key that enables the production of an in focus composite image which does not accumulate noise. Image analysis under computer control will frequently require the use of automatic focusing. Several authors have published criteria which may be used to determine the state of focus of an image. Such criteria have a clear application to the above process. This paper presents an evaluation of some methods used for the processing of such images, and also some procedures used for the determination of sharpness of focus and demonstrates a sensitive method for the evaluation of such procedures. Finally, an implementation of a method which uses the one of the simplest focus criteria is presented, and a procedure for the production of deep focus images which are free from the accumulation of noise...|$|E
40|$|A {{broadening}} {{application range}} has {{increased demand for}} advanced RF control. Recent research has identified several metamaterials to provide this control. This work seeks to expand this idea through several novel metamaterials with enhanced electromagnetic properties. First copper wires braided with Kevlar and nylon to form conductive coils are woven among structural fiber to create a fabric. This yielded a composite with all coils possessing the same handedness, producing a chiral material. The measured scattering parameters showed considerable chirality within the 5. 5 - 8 GHz frequency band, agreeing with simulation results. Electronic chirality tuning is investigated by integrating varactor diodes into an array of helical elements on a printed circuit board. Applying a varied reverse bias voltage across the sample effectively tunes the chiral behavior of the material. The measurements demonstrate the feasibility of creating a rigid helix composite with tuned chirality in the 5. 5 - 12. 4 GHz frequency band. Chirality can be further tuned mechanically through the deformation of an array of conductive coils. Parallel, metallic helices embedded in a polyurethane matrix are subjected to mechanical stretching for pitch adjustment. This change in pitch directly affects the overall chirality of the composite. Repeatable elastic deformation is achieved up to 50 % axial strain. Over the 5. 5 - 12. 5 GHz frequency range, an increase of 30 % axial strain yields an ~ 18 % change in axial chirality. Hyperbolic microwave focusing is explored through an indefinite medium with anisotropic permittivity. An array of 12 -gauge brass wires is embedded in Styrofoam and scanned over the 7 - 9 GHz frequency band to establish focusing patterns. A soft-focusing spot is observed at 7. 6 GHz with a relative gain of ~ 7 dB over averaged background. Applying an axial refractive gradient to a coil composite creates a lens capable of fine adjustment in the microwave range. The gradient required to achieve <b>sharp</b> <b>focusing,</b> {{and the extent of}} this effect, is calculated through an anisotropic ray-tracing analysis. A composite is created using coils of opposite handedness to minimize chiral effects. Through extension of these coils, the refractive index can effectively be fine-tuned to achieve the desired result. Measurements and full-wave simulations confirm a gain of 6 - 8 dB over averaged background at the predicted focal frequencie...|$|E
