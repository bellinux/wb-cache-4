50|$|Virtual folders {{are also}} a {{well-established}} construct in email clients. In early 1991, the Emacs-based mail reader VM provided a virtual folder facility in its version 5.09. VM allows the users to define virtual folders using rules, taking their mail content from one or more physical folders and based on selection criteria dealing with dates, authors, recipient, <b>subject,</b> <b>message</b> body etc. Virtual folders can also be created interactively and take content from previously defined virtual folders, thereby cascading the selection criteria. The Evolution email client created by Helix Code in 2000, also incorporated virtual folders. Folders can be created that automatically list e-mails matching user-defined rules, for example all e-mail from a particular address or all e-mail that includes a specific keyword. The Opera web browser released a new mail client (beta in November 2002, final version in Jan 2003), M2 in which virtual folders (called access points) were used for all email management. Virtual folders were automatically made for active contacts, for attachments and for assigned labels. Virtual folders were also automatically generated whenever a search was performed, and manual virtual folders could use multiple logical mail header rules for their construction (including using regular expressions). Microsoft Outlook 2003 added a similar feature called Search Folders. Gmail, first released in 2004, bases all of its mail management on virtual folders accessed via labels. Mozilla Thunderbird also {{has the ability to}} create search folders and from version 1.5 allowed the search to be done over more than one email account.|$|E

It is not easy to find out the important email or message quickly or within a stipulated time. So we are using clustering techniques for grouping similar emails. The attributes of an email like sender email id, receiver email id, <b>subject,</b> <b>message</b> body, sending time, attachments, cc, bcc, etc. are used for clustering the emails. Email classification can be applied to several different applications, including filtering messages based on priority, assigning messages to user-created folders, or identifying SPAM. In this project we are going to add certain extra features like clustering based {{on the subject of the}} email, priority of the person who sends the message, message body contents, date and time, size of the message and also add automatic answering feature for a received mail...|$|E

In addition to the brighter prospects which the proposed cable was opening up, the presence of the largest ship that had ever yet been constructed was a point of overwhelming attraction, and so great were the crowds that went on board to see the marine wonder, that it was found somewhat difficult to carry on the necessary work of coaling and making preparations for the voyage.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an adaptive system that “closes the loop ” by utilizing a real-time, directly sensed measure of cognitive {{state of the}} human operator. The Honeywell Augmented Cognition team has developed a Closed Loop Integrated Prototype (CLIP) of a Communications Scheduler, for application to the U. S. Army’s Future Force Warrior (FFW) program. It is expected that in a highly networked environment the sheer magnitude of communication traffic could overwhelm the individual soldier. The CLIP exploits real-time neurophysiological and physiological measurements of the human operator {{in order to create}} a cognitive state profile, which is used to augment the work environment to improve human-automation joint performance. An experiment showed that the Communications Scheduler enabled higher situation awareness and message comprehension in high workload conditions. Based solely on cognitive state, the system inferred a <b>subject’s</b> <b>message</b> comprehension and repeated unattended messages in the majority of cases, without yielding an unacceptably high false alarm rate...|$|R

40|$|We study {{a message}} passing network where nodes keep a numeric {{attitude}} toward a <b>subject.</b> <b>Messages</b> {{are created by}} a message factory and each is sent to a random seed-node, which then gets eventually propagated in the network. Each message has some information about the subject, which is interpreted by the receiving node based on its features. Hence, the same message could be interpreted quite differently by two different nodes. Once a message is interpreted, {{the attitude of the}} node toward the subject is updated. In this setting, the thesis is that an external agent can influence (in a desired way) the average attitude of the network, by sending the messages to specific nodes (rather than sending them randomly) based on the message content. We call this agent a leader which its goal is to minimize (maximize) the average attitude of the network, and its actions are choosing one of the seed-nodes for a given message. The leader does not have any information about the nodes in advance, instead, it eventually learns the interests of the seed-nodes through sending messages and receiving the feedback of the network. We formulate this as a contextual bandit problem and study the effectiveness of a leader in different network configurations. Moreover, we study the case that there are two adversarial leaders, and present different policies and evaluate their effectiveness. Finally, we study the leader's performance when there are dynamic changes in the nodes features and network's topology...|$|R

In wide area networks and wireless networks, the occurrence of process crashes, high delay variations and burst losses in message packets are common. So, this paper proposes a failure detector configurator which {{takes into account the}} probability distribution of loss burst lengths of message packets, by using a Markov model.

40|$|In the {{reliable}} message transmission problem (RMTP) processors {{communicate by}} exchanging messages, but the channel that connects two processors is <b>subject</b> to <b>message</b> loss, duplication, and reordering. Previous work focused on proposing protocols in asynchronous systems, where message size is finite and sequence numbers are bounded. However, if the channel can duplicate messages, lose messages, and arbitrarily reorder the messages, {{the problem is}} unsolvable. In this thesis, we consider a strengthening of the asynchronous model in which reordering of messages is bounded. In this model, we develop two efficient protocols to solve the RMTP: (1) when messages may be duplicated but not lost and (2) when messages may be duplicated and lost. This result {{is in contrast to}} the impossibility of such an algorithm when reordering is unbounded. Our protocols have the pleasing property that no messages need to be sent from the receiver to the sender...|$|R
