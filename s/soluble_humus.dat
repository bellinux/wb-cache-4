The incubation of wot soil untreated, however, leads to the mineralization of soil organic nitrogen by raising the incubating temperature from 30 ℃ to 40 ℃. In this paper, we called all the organic matter easily mineralized by treatments above mentioned 2 ̆ 2 easily decomposable organic matter, and studied, in the first, on the relation of such organic matter to Tyulin 2 ̆ 7 s so-called organomineral colloidal complexes of paddy soil?G 1, and G 2 groups?, {{and in the second}} on it 2 ̆ 7 s forms. From the results obtained in the first experiment; it was concluded that (1) the organic nitrogen mineralized by air-drying paddy soil is largely originatedfrom G 1, (2) that mineralized by raising the incubating temperature from 30 ℃ to 40 ℃, {{with the exception of the}} annual water-lodged paddy soil, is largely originated from G 2, (3) that mineralized by treating the paddy soil with alkali and adding the neutral sals is respectively originated from both G 1 and G 2. It was, therefore, elucidated that 2 ̆ 2 easily decomposable organic matter 2 ̆ 2 is held on Tyulin 2 ̆ 7 s so-called G 1 and G 2 groups. Now, when we call the organic matt e r which is peptized by the Tyulin 2 ̆ 7 s method 2 ̆ 2 easily <b>soluble</b> <b>humus</b> 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 easily decomposable organic matter 2 ̆ 2 is presumably contained in it. The results obtained in the second lead to the conclusion that easily <b>soluble</b> <b>humus</b> is for the most part Simon 2 ̆ 7 s so-called rotted products and Page 2 ̆ 7 s so-called non-humic matter, and that 2 ̆ 2 easily decomposable organic matter 2 ̆ 2 is a part of the rotted products and non-humic matter. 水田土壌の有機態窒素の無機化促進法としては, 従来の研究から, 乾土効果, 地温上昇, 土壌の稀薄アルカリ処理数果, 腐植解膠性中性毒類添加の数果等が挙げられるが, 効果筆者等はこのような処理方法で微生物によつて無機化される有機態窒素を易分解性有機物と呼ぴ, 易分解性有機物とチュリンの所謂土壌有機・無機膠質複合体との関係, 易分解性有機物の腐植の形態等に就いて実験を行い, 次のような結論を得た. (1) 乾土数果, 即ち水田土壌を予じめ風乾して, これを湛水放置した場合に無機化する有機態窒素の大部分はチューリンの所謂G 1 膠質群中にある. (2) 地温上昇効果, 即ち水田土壌を濕潤土のまま湛水放置し, 放置温度を 30 ℃から 40 ℃に上げる場合に無機化する有機態窒素は勿論G 2 膠質群中にもあるが, その大部は, 濕田を除けば, チューリンの所謂G 2 膠質群中にある. (3) 稀薄アルカリ処理効果及び腐植解膠性中性塩類の添加数果, 即ち水田の濕潤土にアルカリを添加し約pH 9 に調節後, これを湛水放置した場合に無機化する有機態窒素及び腐植解膠性中性塩類を, 腐植の解膠を起す程度に添加し湛水放置した場合に無機化する有機態窒素はG 1 三及びG 2 膠質群に明かにまたがつていることが確められた. 何れにしても, 易分解性有機物にはチューリンの所謂G 1, G 2 膠質群中にあることは確である. そして今土壌を稀薄なHCI(0. 01 N) で処理水洗した後, アルカリ性(0. 01 N) とした場合に分散して来る有機物を易溶性有機物と呼べぱ, 易努解性有機勃は易溶性有機物中に含有されている. 更に易分解性有機物は易溶性有機物の中,腐植化の進んでいないものであることが推定された...|$|E
40|$|Abiotic {{environmental}} factors of biological productivity were studied in seven lakes with low water exchange {{and a few}} inflows in different landscapes of Karelia (Russia). Lakes are not exposed to human impact. An indicator of the biological productivity is the phytoplankton photosynthesis rate calculated on the concentration of phosphorus in water. The water bodies vary from oligotrophic to mesotrophic according to their trophic level. Cluster and component analysis of chemicals was carried out, hydrological, morphometric and landscape characteristics of the lakes were also determined. It was shown that {{in the absence of}} anthropogenic influence the availability of phosphorus and trophic level of the studied lakes in the humid zone are determined by the water exchange, effluent per unit of water column, color of water and landscape features. The most productive water bodies are located on the fluvioglacial and moraine plains dominated by podsolic soils, which have a good flashing regime and <b>soluble</b> <b>humus</b> substances. These lakes are distinguished by a larger inflow of phosphorus forming a part of humus substances originated from the water-collecting area per unit of water column. Oligotrophic lakes are located in moraine and selga landscapes dominated by podbours and brown soils with a lot of humus slightly transformed. These lakes are characterized by less water exchange and drainage factor, and, accordingly, low values of phosphorus input and water color...|$|E
