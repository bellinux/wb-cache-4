2500|$|Autoimmunity {{can thus}} be defined simply as {{exceptions}} to the tolerance [...] "rules." [...] By doing this, an immune response is generated against self-tissue and cells. These mechanisms are known {{by many to be}} intrinsic. However, there are pathogenic mechanisms for the generation of autoimmune disease. Pathogens can induce autoimmunity by polyclonal activation of B or T cells, or increased expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or II molecules. There are several ways in which a pathogen can cause an autoimmune response. A pathogen may contain a protein that acts as a mitogen to encourage cell division, thus causing more B or T cell clones to be produced. Similarly, a pathogenic protein may act as a <b>superantigen</b> which causes rapid polyclonal activation of B or T cells. Pathogens can also cause the release of cytokines resulting in the activation of B or T cells, or they can alter macrophage function. Finally, pathogens may also expose B or T cells to cryptic determinants, which are self antigen determinants that have not been processed and presented sufficiently to tolerize the developing T cells in the thymus and are presented at the periphery where the infection occurs.|$|E

40|$|The role of <b>superantigens</b> in {{infectious}} diseases Exogenous antigens are presented to T lymphocytes through a mechanism that ensures a high recognition specificity.

40|$|Abstract: Bacterial <b>superantigens</b> {{trigger an}} excessive, Th 1 -cytokine {{response}} leading to toxic shock. We designed a peptide antagonist that inhibits SEB-induced expression of human genes for IL- 2, IFN-�, and TNF-�, cytokines that mediate shock. The peptide antagonist shows homology to a �-strand-hinge-�-helix domain that is conserved structurally in <b>superantigens</b> produced by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes yet remote from known binding {{sites for the}} major histocompatibility class II molecule and T-cell receptor. For Th 1 -cell activation, <b>superantigens</b> depend on this domain. The peptide protected mice against lethal challenge with SEB or SEA. Moreover, it rescued mice undergoing toxic shock. Surviving mice rapidly developed broad-spectrum, protective immunity, which rendered them resistant to further lethal challenges with different staphylococcal and streptococcal <b>superantigens.</b> Thus, the lethal effect of <b>superantigens,</b> mediated by Th 1 cytokines, can be blocked with a peptide antagonist that inhibits their action {{at the top of}} the toxicity cascade, before activation of T cells takes place.

40|$|<b>Superantigens</b> are {{the most}} potent T-cell mitogens so far described, and are {{believed}} to activate virtually all the T lymphocytes bearing the appropriate V beta segment in their T-cell receptor (TcR).

The paper objective was Identification of common bacterial antigens and S. aureus <b>superantigens</b> in synovial fluid (SF) of children with negative culture and direct smear for other bacteria except for S. aureus.  Methods: In this cross-sectional study a total of 62 patients {{with a mean age of}} 11 ± 3. 8 years (range: 5 months- 16 years) with acute arthritis in pediatric and orthopedic wards of Rasoul hospital (2008 - 2010) were studied. Three common bacterial antigens (e. g. S. Pneumonia, H. influenza, N. meningitis) using LPA (latex particle antigen) and Staphylococcal <b>superantigens</b> (TSST 1; Enterotoxin A; B; C) using ELISA method (ABcam; USA) were identified in 60 adequate SF samples with negative culture and negative direct smears (for other bacteria except for S. aureus. Staphylococcal <b>superantigens</b> were compared with S. aureus infection (positive culture or direct smear).  Results: Positive bacterial antigens (LPA test) were found in 4 cases including two S. Pneumonia, one N. meningitis, and one H. influenza. S. aureus was diagnosed in 7 cases including 4 positive cultures and 3 positive smears. Staphylococcal <b>superantigens</b> (toxins) were found in 73 % of SF samples. Some cases had 2 or 3 types of toxins. S. aureus toxins were reported in 47 % of culture negative SF samples. Positive TSST 1, Enterotoxin B, Enterotoxin A, and Enterotoxin C were found in 47 % (n= 28), 18 % (n= 10), 39 % (n= 22), and 39 % (n= 21) of cases respectively. The most common type of <b>superantigens</b> was TSST 1; and Enterotoxin A was the less common type. Except for Enterotoxin A, no relation between positive S. aureus culture and positive tests for <b>superantigens</b> in SF was found.  Conclusion: S. aureus has a prominent role in septic arthritis. S. aureus toxins might have a prominent role in arthritis with negative SF culture. Rapid identification of bacterial antigens (LPA) or S. aureus <b>superantigens</b> (toxins) are valuable for diagnosis in cases with negative cultures.

40|$|<b>Superantigens</b> are bacterial, viral, or {{retroviral}} proteins {{which can}} activate specifically {{a large proportion}} of T cells. In contrast with classical peptide antigen recognition, <b>superantigens</b> do not require processing to small peptides but act as complete or partially processed proteins.

The other polymorphic parts of the T cell receptor, which are crucial for classical antigen recognition, are not important for this interaction.
