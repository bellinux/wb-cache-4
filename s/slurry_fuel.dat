50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, the Soviet Union looked for {{new methods of}} using coal sludge for power generation. Coal-water <b>slurry</b> <b>fuel</b> was made in a Ball mill which {{pulverised}} the coal or coal sludge. This was done near a coal mine in Belovo, Siberia. The coal-water <b>slurry</b> <b>fuel</b> was transported through a pipeline to Novosibirskaya TEC-5, Novosibirsk, a distance of 262 km. The pipeline had three intermediate pumping stations. The Belovo Novosibirsk project used coal-water <b>slurry</b> <b>fuel</b> in steam boilers {{at a rate of}} 1340 tonnes per hour. There was a further project at Belovo Novosibirsk between 1989 and 1993 and development of coal-water <b>slurry</b> <b>fuel</b> technology for district heating stations and power stations. In 2004, a coal water <b>slurry</b> <b>fuel</b> production plant was opened at Enskiy village, Murmansk.|$|E
50|$|Large {{particle}} coal-water <b>slurry</b> <b>fuel</b> {{can be used}} {{to produce}} steam in boilers. Smaller (under 80 micrometer) particle coal-water <b>slurry</b> <b>fuel</b> can be used in diesel engines with or without co-fuels. For example, low speed marine or modular power plant diesels can operate on pure coal-water <b>slurry</b> <b>fuel</b> whereas medium speed diesels such as locomotive engines may need diesel 2 as a co-fuel which will act as an ignition source. Very small (5 to 10 micrometer) particle coal-water <b>slurry</b> <b>fuel</b> has been trialled in combined cycle gas turbine power plants. Smaller sized particles are more versatile in use but are more difficult to produce.|$|E
30|$|Rheological {{characteristics}} {{are very important}} to the industrial application of <b>slurry</b> <b>fuels.</b> These are not only related to the slurrying properties, but also directly affect the pumping, atomizing and combustion performances of the <b>slurry</b> <b>fuels</b> (Ma et al. 2012, 2013 a, b; Li et al. 2010; Meikap et al. 2005; Chen et al. 2009). Usually PCWS is expected to be of high viscosity to promote stability during storage and low viscosity to ensure fluidity during transport; hence, “shear-thinning” pseudoplastic {{characteristics are}} generally required in industry.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{ignition}} and combustion behaviour of single droplets of <b>slurry</b> <b>fuels</b> {{made from a}} coconut shell biochar was experimentally investigated. The <b>slurry</b> <b>fuels</b> were prepared with water content varying from 50 to 70 wt% and the median particle size (D 50) of the biochar of approximately 10 μm. The suspended single droplets of the <b>slurry</b> <b>fuels</b> wereignited and burned in air at 1023 K. The ignition delay time, burnout time and burning ratewere measured. It {{was found that the}} ignition delay time slightly increased as the water content increased from 50 wt% to 65 wt% but then decreased as the water further increased to 70 wt%, indicating that the effect of water content on the ignition delay time is a trade-off between the water evaporation time and biochar oxidation rate. Increasing droplet size or decreasing water content led to longer burnout timesof residual biochar. The burning rate of the residual biochar decreased with increasing the droplet size or decreasing water content...|$|R
30|$|The {{slurrying}} {{properties are}} most important for industrial application of the <b>slurry</b> <b>fuels.</b> The solid concentration of the <b>slurry</b> <b>fuels</b> should be increased {{as much as possible}} to reach a high level of heat value and thus ensure efficient gasification and combustion, but the viscosity should be low enough to facilitate preparation, pumping and atomization of the slurry. Many studies are aimed at influencing factors on PCWS’s slurrying properties (Gao et al. 2012 a, b; He et al. 2011; Xu et al. 2008; Vitolo et al. 1996; Wang et al. 2006). Yet, up to now, the effect of pH on slurrying properties of PCWS is rarely reported. Acid–alkali properties of the slurry can directly influence the interactions between the additives and the surface of petroleum coke particles and subsequently influence the slurrying properties of PCWS. In this work, the effects of pH on the slurrying properties of PCWS were investigated.|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of coal-water slurries as a boiler fuel is rapidly approaching commercialization. As distinguished from dilute pipeline <b>slurries,</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>slurries</b> are stable, highly-loaded (e. g. 70 % dry coal by weight) liquids {{which can be}} transported, stored, pumped, and burned like residual fuel oil. One of the key technologies required to obtain highly-loaded, low-viscosity mixtures is the particle size distribution of the coal. Two derivations of the optimum particle-size distribution for minimum slurry viscosity are compared and shown to result in equivalent forms. The theory of grinding is reviewed, and calculated distributions are presented. Experimentally-determined particle-size distributions obtained by both wet and dry grinding in ball mills are given and compared with the theoretical grinding results. It is shown that near-optimum distributions {{can be obtained by}} blending. I...|$|R

40|$|<b>Slurry</b> <b>fuels</b> {{of various}} forms of solids in diesel fuel are {{developed}} and evaluated for their relative potential as fuel for diesel engines. Thirteen test fuels with different solids concentrations are formulated using eight different materials. A variety of properties are examined including ash content, sulfur content, particle size distribution, and rheological properties.

The slurries are also tested in a single cylinder CLR engine in both direct injection and prechamber configurations. The data includes the normal performance parameters as well as heat release rates and emissions. The slurries perform very much like the baseline fuel.

40|$|Since the {{successful}} Coal-Oil Mixture tests {{carried out by}} G-M from 1975 to 1977, COM is rapidly maturing into a commercially available alternative fuel which is presently being produced and combusted by various companies in the United States. Long-term combustion and operating results are still required to firmly establish COM as a 'tried and true' commercial fuel to compete with residual oil, {{and in some cases}} natural gas. Although COM application is very site specific, payback for a retrofit would normally be less than three with a 10 % savings on the fuel. At the present time, there are at least four major produces offering COM as an alternate fuel. COM's future in utility and industrial applications looks good at this time, however, other developing <b>slurry</b> <b>fuels</b> and alternate fuels will become strong competitors in the years ahead.

30|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} with <b>slurry</b> <b>fuels</b> is in simultaneously maintaining the highest possible solid concentration stably and at a viscosity that is optimal for industrial application. Petroleum coke–water slurry (PCWS) has good slurryability but inferior stability because of high hydrophobic properties of petroleum coke, which can be overcome by co-slurrying of petroleum coke with lignite. Rich reserves of lignite in China—which account for up to 17  % of all Chinese coal resources—have attracted increasing attention as raw material for gasification (Zhan et al. 2011). The presence of significant amounts of inherent moisture and high oxygen content in lignite renders the preparation of lignite–water slurry (LWS) difficult. In contrast, such high hydrophilicity due to the extensive numbers of oxygen functional groups is beneficial for maintaining a good and stable slurry (Yu et al. 2012). Therefore, the blending of petroleum coke with lignite to prepare petroleum coke–lignite slurry (PCLS) can produce synergistic effects. PCLS with high-solid concentration, high calorific value, good fluidity, and excellent stability is desirable for gasification and combustion.|$|R
