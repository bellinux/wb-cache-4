2500|$|The {{origins of}} the blanket sleeper can be traced {{at least as far}} back as the late 19th century, to footed, {{one-piece}} sleeping garments for children, then known as night drawers. The first company to mass-produce blanket sleepers was Doctor Denton Sleeping Mills, which started using the term [...] "sleeping garment", for their garments, starting in 1865, and most had buttons instead of zippers (since the zipper wasn't invented until the early 20th century), and trap-doors or butt-flaps in the back, as early blanket sleepers, quite obviously, took on the same basic design as the traditional union-suit (which may have been where the idea of the sleeper originated; as the children's version of their fathers' union-suits). [...] However, the blanket sleeper first took something closely resembling its present form in the early 1950s, when many of the most recognizable features were first adopted, including the use of synthetic fabrics, <b>slip-resistant</b> soles, toe caps, rib-knit collar and cuffs, zipper closure, snap tab, and applique. [...] The term blanket sleeper also first came into common use at this time, although sleeper by itself appeared considerably earlier.|$|E

Some of the qualities of the material are that it is resistant to discoloration from the silica (beach sand), stain-resistant, <b>slip-resistant,</b> and able to withstand wear and tear for a lifetime. Also they are non-porous so as to not absorb water. The circular and triangular shapes are formed using die cut molds, and work fluidly with the undulating slopes of the promenade.

All of the 100% waterproof marine boots have non marking, <b>slip-resistant</b> soles in order to avoid any damage to the vessel's deck. All boots require thermal socks as the rubber does not provide enough warmth. Technical boots have a minimal insulating lining which is why socks are well advised.|$|E

5000|$|Sustainable Slip Resistance is a {{particular}} floor friction testing method and selection criteria for use in choosing and sourcing <b>slip-resistant</b> flooring that maintains good tribological characteristics over its life cycle to minimize slip and fall accidents. Testing floors before and after they are in place on a property can assure a building owner that safe flooring has been chosen and installed for its intended use. This floor slip resistance testing method, developed by the McDonald's Restaurant chain and now specified by many other property owners (e.g. Westfield, Aldi, Toyota) assesses the effects of mild abrasion on wet slip resistance. This test identifies flooring that has a high propensity to lose its wet slip resistance.|$|E

50|$|Over 150 safety {{criteria}} {{have been}} adopted in Germany and Australia for specific situations — swimming pool decks, commercial kitchens, restrooms, etc. These {{are based on a}} laboratory test device, the variable-angleramp, that is not readily portable. The pendulum tester is a portable ASTM method, has been used successfully since at least 1971 for assessing pedestrian traction potential, and is a national standard for pedestrian traction in 48 nations on four continents. Abrasion of a flooring sample, tested with the pendulum before and after, is being used to assess “Sustainable Slip Resistance.” Some architects and property owners are now combining this pendulum-based test with situation-specific safety criteria to specify and verify safe flooring. If flooring is in an area where it can get wet or otherwise lubricated (airborne deep-fryer fat, automobile grease, etc.), it needs to be <b>slip-resistant</b> under such conditions.|$|E

5000|$|Silicone Tails: Currently, {{silicone}} rubber tails (also known as platinum-cure silicone tails and Dragonskin silicone tails, after a silicone brand name) {{are the most}} popular and most expensive tails on the market. In addition to being relatively lifelike and durable, silicone tails are skin-safe and inert in most environments once cured. Neutral buoyancy in the water allows for ease of sinking and natural-looking swimming, although they are quite heavy (25-60 lbs) out of the water. Colors and patterns are only limited by the designer's imagination, and if produced properly, paint or pigment does not chip off the tail. The material has excellent elasticity, allowing relative ease in getting {{in and out of the}} tail, and fitting snugly once on. Silicone is <b>slip-resistant</b> and grips the skin, which results in less tail slip or gapping during vigorous swimming. It is rare to find silicone tails for less than $1000 USD, even used, and their prices increase with the amount of extra detail, color, and number of fins added. Silicone tails can costs many thousands of dollars. Mermaid Linden's tail is reported to have cost over $10,000 USD. [...] Due to the expense and heavier weight involved, platinum-cure silicone tails are not recommended for beginners.|$|E
40|$|AbstractVon Willebrand factor (vWF) adsorbs and immobilizes {{platelets}} {{at sites}} of injury under high-shear-rate conditions. It has been recently demonstrated that single vWF molecules only adsorb significantly to collagen above a threshold shear, {{and here we}} explain such counterintuitive behavior using a coarse-grained simulation and a phenomenological theory. We find that shear-induced adsorption only occurs if the vWF-surface bonds are <b>slip-resistant</b> such that force-induced unbinding is suppressed, which occurs in many biological bonds (i. e., catch bonds). Our results quantitatively match experimental observations and may be {{important to understand the}} activation and mechanical regulation of vWF activity during blood clotting...|$|E

EN 1090 - 2 specifies slip factors for often used surface conditions. For deviating conditions, slip factors have to be determined experimentally according to Annex G of EN 1090 - 2. The practice shows, that the slip test procedure according to Annex G is not clear in detail. For instance, the slip load {{has been defined as}} the load corresponding to a slip of 0. 15 mm. Furthermore, static tests have to be performed using a “normal speed” which is not clearly specified.
