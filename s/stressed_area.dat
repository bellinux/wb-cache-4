In 2012, Vancouver was ranked by Demographia as the second-most unaffordable in the world, rated as even more severely unaffordable in 2012 than in 2011. The city has adopted various strategies to reduce housing costs, including cooperative housing, legalized secondary suites, increased density and smart growth. As of April 2010, the average two-level home in Vancouver sold for a record high of $987,500, compared with the Canadian average of $365,141.|$|E

50|$|The {{primary means}} of failure in a slate roof is when {{individual}} slates lose their peg attachment and begin to slide out of place. This can open up small gaps above each slate. A secondary mode of failure is when the slates themselves begin to break up. The lower parts of a slate may break loose, giving a gap below a slate. Commonly the small and <b>stressed</b> <b>area</b> above the nail hole may fail, allowing the slate to slip as before. In the worst cases, a slate may simply break in half and be lost altogether. A common repair to slate roofs is to apply 'torching', a mortar fillet underneath the slates, attaching them to the battens.13 This may applied as either a repair, to hold slipping slates, or pre-emptively on construction.|$|E

Double-line and four-line structures are applied to the type II guides to increase mode confinement.

30|$|The {{results of}} the current study {{expressed}} that stress values above the corticotomy line were decreased creating a more <b>stressed</b> <b>area</b> below this line. In other words, the force generated by the RME remained in the corticotomy applied maxillary part. The stress levels of the non-corticotomy side were lower below the zygomatic buttress and higher above this region. Therefore, the over-stressed maxillary half splitted by the corticotomy could be moved easily in the transverse direction whereas the other part resisted to the RME force. Our findings were harmonious with a previous study which pointed out stress changes depending on the extent of surgical approaches [13].|$|E

Oxidation profiles have been compared to stress distribution profiles, resulting from a FE analysis conducted on the same liners geometries and couplings.

It was therefore possible to establish a correlation between <b>stressed</b> <b>areas</b> and observed oxidation...|$|R

The measurement was done with the Neutron Diffraction Method using the Neutron Diffractometer DN 1 -M PSTBM BATAN. A number of 15 points with 45 measurement directions were conducted on the k area in normal, transversal and longitudinal directions. The result of the experiment showed 185 Mpa and 160 Mpa residual stress magnitude in longitudinal and transversal directions in the same directions with the weld toe welding between the web and flange with the extent of the <b>stress</b> <b>area</b> 8 times of the flange thickness. The perpendicular welding of the weld toe resulted in 162 Mpa and 145 Mpa residual stresses in longitudinal and transversal directions with 4 times <b>stress</b> <b>area</b> extent from the flange thickness. The residual stress magnitude and the width of <b>stress</b> <b>area</b> indicated the k area as a vulnerable area to the initial crack occurrence, which may decrease the link performance.

40|$|Objective　To {{explore the}} effect of hemodynamic factors on the {{pathogenesis}} and development of intracranial aneurysms. The fluid-structure interaction (FSI) between blood and vessel wall would {{be considered in the}} process. Methods　 Based on the data of volume CT digital subtraction angiography (VCTDSA) in a patient with intracranial aneurysms, a true 3 D model of intracranial aneurysms was obtained by 3 D reconstruction and segmentation in the Mimics 10. 0 software. The model was induced into ANSYS 14. 0 software, and the vessel wall model was constructed based on human physiology. Fluid model and vascular wall model of intracranial aneurysms were calculated and analyzed with fluid-structure interaction using the finite element method. Results　In a cardiac cycle, an obvious vortex flow was contantly found inside the aneurysm with low shear <b>stress</b> <b>area</b> at the top and high shear <b>stress</b> <b>area</b> at the neck of aneurysm. There are larger deformation and Von-Mises <b>stress</b> <b>area</b> at the top, body and neck of the aneurysm. Conclusion　By fluid-structure coupling numerical simulation to explore the blood flow characteristics and biomechanical properties of the wall of aneurysm, the possible region prone to rupture may be speculated, thus the rupture risk of aneurysm may be evaluated. This method can provide a technical support for further research of hemodynamics of intracranial aneurysm. 		 		DOI: 10. 11855 /j. issn. 0577 - 7402. 2014. 11. 0...|$|R

40|$|During the {{sovereign}} debt crisis investors rebalanced out of stressed and into non-stressed euro area countries, thereby {{contributing to the}} tensions in euro area financial markets. This paper examines the geographical pattern of this great rebalancing. Specifically, we test whether euro area and non-euro area investors adjusted their holdings of debt securities of euro <b>area</b> <b>stressed</b> and non-stressed countries dis-proportionately relative to benchmarks derived from a standard gravity model for portfolio choice. We find that non-euro area investors under-invested in <b>stressed</b> euro <b>area</b> countries, but did not over-invest in non-stressed euro area countries. As regards intra-euro area flows, we do not find evidence for a disproportionate slowdown of capital flows from non-stressed into <b>stressed</b> euro <b>area</b> countries. Instead, our results suggest that investors in <b>stressed</b> euro <b>area</b> countries disproportionately shifted capital into debt securities of non-stressed euro area countries.

Each cured insulator is bonded to the BSM aluminum aft closure with an epoxy adhesive, and some of the curved areas in the rubber may have significant residual stresses. A number of recently bonded NBR insulators have shown fine surface cracks, and stressed insulator areas may be aging at a faster rate than unstressed areas, thus hastening the surface cracking.

Magnesium alloys are the improving materials with their better mechanical properties. The analysis was performed by using explicit version of ABAQUS Finite Element Modules. For achieving better and more realistic solution Incremental Sheet Forming (ISF) technique was used. In the present investigation, a Single Point Incremental Forming (SPIF) tool containing hemispherical end was used to characterize the formability of AZ 61 A magnesium alloy sheet. For the simulations the punch and dies were assumed to be rigid bodies. The forming loads and details of formability for AZ 61 A were obtained using contour plots of stress and strain. From the analysis, the formability of the material has been obtained. Stress, strain developed were also found and the maximum <b>stressed</b> <b>area</b> are noted which helps in determining the failure of the sheet metal during forming operation...|$|E

Four areas {{were selected for}} detailed study: 1) high stress, population predominantly black, 2) white, 3) low stress, population predominantly black, 4) white. A sample was drawn from each area of persons of the predominant race, 25 - 60 years old, married and living with spouse, and having relatives in the Detroit Area. Nurses interviewed such persons; three blood pressure readings were taken during the first half-hour of medical history, and skin color was rated. Results show that darker skin color, for black males especially, is related to higher pressure, independently of nine control variables (e. g., age, weight, socioeconomic status, etc.). However, younger black males (25 - 39 years of age) in high <b>stress</b> <b>areas</b> had higher pressure than counterparts in low <b>stress</b> <b>areas,</b> regardless of skin color and relative weight; for older black males (40 - 59 years of age) darker skin color was correlated with higher pressure, regardless of relative weight or <b>stress</b> <b>area.</b> For 35 blacks whose fathers were from the West Indies, pressures were higher than those with American-born fathers. These findings suggest that varied gene mixtures {{may be related to}} blood pressure levels and that skin color, an indicator of possible metabolic significance, combines with socially induced stress to induce higher blood pressures in lower class American blacks...|$|R
