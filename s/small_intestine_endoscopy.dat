40|$|Presently, problem-free {{diagnosis}} and therapy for diseases in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are not available. Particularly challenging is {{the treatment of}} diseases deep within the <b>small</b> <b>intestine.</b> <b>Endoscopy</b> is {{the most commonly used}} method for accessing the GI tract. However, the endoscope cannot reach much of the small intestines 25 feet of length. Techniques used currently are demanding on doctors and painful for their patients. In order to decrease trauma to patients and demands on physicians researchers have been focused on the development of minimally invasive endoscopy techniques. This dissertation presents the development and evaluation of a novel endoscopy method utilizing suction for locomotion within the small bowel. Several suction tips were designed and tested. Testing consisted of inserting suction tips in the small intestine of swine and allowing them to attach to the intestinal wall using vacuum alone, followed by the pulling of the tip parallel (longitudinal) to the intestine. Damage to the intestine was determined by histology and visual inspection. Data collected consisted of applied vacuum, the force required to pull the tip along the intestine and the position. Vacuum forces of 86 kPa were used to generate maximum pull forces of 4. 7 N. Results indicate locomotion by means of suction tips similar to those used in this study are safe and pose no significant harm to the intestinal wall. Additionally, forces of these magnitudes have significant potential in the locomotion of various therapeutic devices. Finally, the analyses and resultant data are presented. The results obtained support the theoretical and practical claims made by this dissertation...|$|E
40|$|Wireless Capsule {{endoscopy}} (WCE) {{allows a}} physician {{to examine the}} entire <b>small</b> <b>intestine.</b> Capsule <b>endoscopy</b> helps physicians to view <b>small</b> <b>intestine’s</b> internal structure- an area that isn’t easily reached with conventional endoscopy in a more distinct way. The most crucial problem with this technology is that too many images produced by WCE causes a tough task to physicians, so it is very significant if we can help physicians do diagnosis using computerized methods. In this paper, a new method aimed for small bowel tumor detection of WCE images is proposed. This new approach mainly focuses on texture feature, a powerful clue used by physicians, to detect tumor images with Supervisedclassification. Analysis is also done using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) based Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Unsupervised classification to discriminate tumor regions from normal regions.

50|$|Capsule {{endoscopy}} is used {{to examine}} parts of the gastrointestinal tract that cannot be seen {{with other types of}} endoscopy. Upper endoscopy, also called EGD, uses a camera attached to a long flexible tube to view the esophagus, the stomach {{and the beginning of the}} first part of the <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> called the duodenum. A colonoscope, inserted through the rectum, can view the colon and the distal portion of the <b>small</b> <b>intestine,</b> the terminal ileum. These two types of endoscopy cannot visualize the majority of the middle portion of the gastrointestinal tract, the <b>small</b> <b>intestine.</b> Capsule <b>endoscopy</b> is useful when disease is suspected in the <b>small</b> <b>intestine,</b> and can sometimes diagnose sources of occult bleeding visible microscopically only or causes of abdominal pain such as Crohn's disease, or peptic ulcers. Capsule endoscopy can be used to diagnose problems in the <b>small</b> <b>intestine,</b> but unlike EGD or colonoscopy it cannot treat pathology that may be discovered. Capsule endoscopy transfers the captured images wirelessly to an external receiver worn by the patient using one of appropriate frequency bands. The collected images are then transferred to a computer for diagnosis, review and display. A transmitted radio-frequency signal can be used to accurately estimate the location of the capsule and to track it in real time inside the body and gastrointestinal tract.|$|R

40|$|Background: Pyogenic {{granuloma}} (PG) is a polypoid lobular capillary hemangioma rarely {{observed in}} the gastrointestinal tract. Only a few cases in the small bowel have been described in the literature. Case presentation: A 58 -year-old man had been suffering from general fatigue and severe anemia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy did not reveal any significant bleeding. Abdominal computer tomography revealed a hypervascular tumor in the <b>small</b> <b>intestine.</b> Oral double-balloon <b>endoscopy</b> (DBE) detected a polypoid lesion (2 cm in diameter) in the jejunum. We performed laparoscopic-assisted partial resection of the jejunum. The histological features of the tumor were consistent with PG.

40|$|Gastrointestinal (GI) {{hemorrhage}} is {{a frequent}} and sometimes life-threatening complication of end-stage renal failure. Angiodysplasia (AD), vascular malformation, {{is the most common}} cause of recurrent lower-intestinal hemorrhage in patients with renal failure. We report four chronic hemodialysis patients with AD. All patients presented with severe anemia requiring transfusion. GI hemorrhage ceased spontaneously in three cases and after treatment with argon plasma coagulation in another. Diagnosis of AD is usually challenging, since its cause is still unknown, and its clinical presentation is variable. Lesions are multiple in 40 - 75 &#x 0025; of cases, often located in the stomach and duodenum but can affect the colon and the jejunum.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to search for small bowel lesions by means of a {{perioperative}} endoscopy in 20 patients operated on for Crohn's disease. Seven women and 13 men (mean age 29 years) had a total retrograde exploration to the angle of Treitz during an ileocolectomy (16 of 20 patients) or a colonic or ileal resection (four of 20 patients). Endoscopic exploration was completed, through an enterotomy, from the surgical area to the angle of Treitz. Periendoscopic biopsy samples were taken on macroscopic lesions and every 20 cm systematically. In 13 of 20 cases, various lesions scattered over the whole <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> were found. These were aphthoid ulcerations (10 patients), superficial ulcerations (seven patients), mucosal oedema (three patients), non-ulcerative stenosis (three patients), erythema (two patients), pseudopolyps (two patients), deep ulcerations (two patients), and ulcerative stenosis (one patient). In seven patients none of the lesions detected at perioperative endoscopy had been recognised by preoperative evaluation or surgical inspection of the serosal surface. A typical granuloma was found at biopsy of lesions identified by endoscopy in three cases and at biopsy of an apparently healthy area in one case. Thus 65 % of patients operated on for Crohn's disease had lesions of the <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> detected by <b>endoscopy,</b> which were unrecognised before surgery in more than half of the cases...|$|R
40|$|Wireless capsule {{endoscopy}} (WCE) has revolutionised {{the diagnosis}} and treatment of gastrointestinal tract, especially the <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> where traditional <b>endoscopies</b> cannot reach. However, this new technology leads to the inspection {{of a large number of}} images, which is a time-consuming process and also too hard by naked eyes for doctors. In this paper, we propose a new computerised method for bleeding detection in WCE images. We use the second component of CIE Lab colour space together with appropriate segmentation and enhancement techniques, involving an adaptive anisotropic diffusion (alike Perona–Malik diffusion). As a result of this procedure, it is possible to devise four functions to discriminate between bleeding and normal regions in WCE images. These four bleeding detectors rely on the eigenvalues of the Hessian and on the Laplacian of the modified enhanced image. Multiscale image analysis approach is also involved in the definition of these detectors for handling the maximum and minimum sizes at which the bleeding regions are expected to be found. Experimental results on several medical data-sets show that the new algorithm achieves a very good rate of success and promising performance for bleeding detection...|$|R
40|$|Virtual {{endoscopy}} {{is a novel}} {{three-dimensional reconstruction}} technique that is characterized by strong magnification and distortion of perspective. It simulates true optical endoscopy with the view restricted to the target organ. Following development and optimization of the imaging protocol for hollow organs and of the viewing technique in phantoms, virtual endoscopy was used in evaluating the paranasal sinuses, trachea, and the <b>small</b> and large <b>intestine.</b> Virtual <b>endoscopy</b> requires image acquisition with thin slices and isotropic voxels {{in order to ensure}} adequate visualization of morphologic details. The major role of virtual endoscopy in imaging of the nose, paranasal sinuses, and <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> is in documenting the findings. In evaluation of the trachea, it also serves to provide additional information for detecting central lung cancer. In evaluating the large <b>intestine,</b> virtual <b>endoscopy</b> can replace conventional double-contrast barium enema in preoperative assessment and has the potential to establish itself as the standard of reference, along with flexible coloscopy, for the exclusion or demonstration of colorectal polyps...|$|R
40|$|Video capsule {{endoscopy}} {{has been}} considered the gold standard in the detection of obscure gastro-intestinal bleeding. In the present investigation we conducted a prospective, randomly controlled multi-centre study with 153 patients, in which we compared the PillCam SB 3 (Medtronic) with the new CapsoCam SV- 1 (Nicolai). 75 patients received the PillCam SB 3 and 78 patients the CapsoCam SV- 1. The primary endpoint was the detection of a bleeding source. Secondary endpoints were the <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> passage- and evaluation-time, doctor and patient satisfaction with the examination {{as well as the}} documentation of capsule-associated complications. 153 patients were finally included after randomization of 181 eligible patients. The follow-up period was three months. With a power of 80 %, a difference of 20 % (50 % for the SB 3 capsule versus 70 % for the SV- 1) was hypothesized and tested by means of an χ 2 test at a two-tailed 5 % level of significance. The results showed that the CapsoCam SV- 1 detected more cases of bleeding with 39. 7 % (31 out of 78 examinations) compared to the PillCam SB 3 with 34. 6 % (26 out of 75 examinations). This difference was not statistically significant. The time taken to pass the <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> was faster with the CapsoCam SV- 1 (median: 244 minutes) than with the PillCam SB 3 (median: 256 minutes). Evaluation of data was performed significantly faster with the evaluation software of PillCam SB 3 (median: 27 minutes) than with the CapsoCam SV- 1 (median: 40 minutes). In their rating of the capsule endoscopy {{as well as of the}} respective evaluation software, doctors showed a tendency in favour of the PillCam SB 3. The analysis of patient satisfaction showed a surprisingly high degree of openness on the part of study participants to retrieving the capsule from the stool, with a high rating of examination comfort and without the necessity of wearing an external data recorder on the body. The rates of complication were 17, 9 % with the CapsoCam SV- 1 and 16 % with the PillCam SB 3. The rate of serious adverse events was 0 % with PillCam SB 3 and 4 % with CapsoCam SV- 1. The present study indicates that the CapsoCam SV- 1 can be introduced as a <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> capsule <b>endoscopy</b> for the detection of obscure gastrointestinal haemorrhage and sources of bleeding with results of comparable quality. Although the CapsoCam SV- 1 detected more bleeding sources the relevant findings can be reliably identified by both types of capsules...|$|R
