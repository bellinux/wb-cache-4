25|$|Wandle had {{not only}} lost her bow; what {{remained}} of her was now badly twisted. Readheads <b>straightened</b> <b>her,</b> built a new bow onto her and on either 30 March or 8 April 1943 {{she was ready to}} return to service.|$|E
500|$|Edina Müller {{was born}} on 28 June 1983, [...] {{and raised in the}} Rhineland town of Brühl. In 2000, at the age of 16, she was playing volleyball, and felt pain in her back. A doctor <b>straightened</b> <b>her</b> back, but within two hours she lost feeling in her legs. She was rushed to {{hospital}} where a blood clot was discovered. Diagnosed with paraplegia, she spent the next four months in hospital. She had to repeat Year 10 at Max Ernst Gymnasium, but graduated in 2003. Although she began using a wheelchair, she longed to return to playing sport, and initially tried sitting volleyball. She then took up wheelchair tennis, winning the Hungarian Open in 2005, but ultimately switched to wheelchair basketball, playing for ASV Bonn. In 2005, she was invited to attend a German national team training camp [...] by its coach, Holger Glinicki. The following year she made the national team and won bronze at the World Championships in Amsterdam.|$|E
500|$|Prior {{to hearing}} about The Game, Mowry {{had changed her}} {{appearance}} {{in order to be}} perceived as more mature and to emphasize the differences between herself and her twin sister. During this process, she lost [...] and <b>straightened</b> <b>her</b> hair for auditions. To prepare for the role, she frequently consulted her cousin, retired NFL fullback Jameel Cook, and other professional athletes. Mowry felt that playing the role of Melanie would enable her to be perceived as more mature following her appearances as Tia Landry on Sister, Sister. When discussing her reasons for auditioning, she said that she wanted to take on a more difficult role. She also described The Game as an opportunity to showcase her individuality. Mowry identified Melanie as the closest match to her personality in comparison to her previous roles. She cited her character's relationship with Derwin as reminiscent of her own romance and subsequent marriage to actor Cory Hardrict.|$|E

6000|$|... "With larks {{falling from}} the skies all round you, it's a pity YOU couldn't get put into something," [...] said Mrs. Bradley, <b>straightening</b> <b>her</b> pretty brows.|$|R
50|$|Arzu Karabulut {{admits that}} she is a great fan of Lionel Messi. She said in a {{newspaper}} interview that she even <b>straightens</b> <b>her</b> curly hair for her admiration.|$|R
60|$|Becky {{smiled as}} she spoke, and <b>straightened</b> <b>her</b> bent {{shoulders}} as if settling her burden for another trudge along the path of duty.|$|E
60|$|She {{had come}} to a resolution. Abruptly she got out of bed, {{smoothed}} her sheet and <b>straightened</b> <b>her</b> pillow and lay down, and fell almost instantly asleep.|$|E
60|$|But {{when she}} stood {{with him on the}} steamer again, bound for the Cape, when the spring breeze gave life to her faded hair, she <b>straightened</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulders}} and stood like a conqueror.|$|E
6000|$|... "She's sound. That is, {{she will}} be when we've had a month in which to <b>straighten</b> <b>her</b> up, or have had a {{carpenter}} and foundry gang sent on board her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'A blessing on that Wild Thing {{whoever he}} may be,' said the Woman, <b>straightening</b> <b>her</b> back, 'for I was a busy woman {{this morning and}} he has done me a service.' ...|$|R
60|$|And the girl, roused from semi-somnolence, {{would pull}} herself {{together}} with a little jerk, would <b>straighten</b> <b>her</b> shoulders and lift her chin, whilst a quickly smothered sigh of weariness would escape her lips.|$|R
60|$|But Violet's {{occasional}} fits {{of weakness}} were never {{of a very}} long duration. She dashed her hand impatiently across her eyes, <b>straightened</b> <b>her</b> tall figure, and laughed as she glanced {{at herself in the}} mirror.|$|E
60|$|Una {{carefully}} {{laid down}} the letter. She went over and <b>straightened</b> <b>her</b> mother's red wool slippers. She wanted to postpone for an exquisite throbbing moment the joy of announcing to herself {{that she had made}} a decision.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's curious," [...] Whitney persisted, [...] "because if the fellow's nerve {{had given}} way {{he would have gone}} over the {{motorcycle}} and into the gate. Anyhow, he didn't lose control, because he <b>straightened</b> <b>her</b> up the moment Andrew threw you back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We can anchor {{her without}} trouble," [...] {{said the old}} sailor. [...] "And perhaps <b>straighten</b> <b>her</b> up too, so the deck won't be so slanty. Then she'll be a reg'lar hotel for all hands." ...|$|R
50|$|Cahoon {{attended}} Vanderbilt University {{while continuing}} with treatments <b>straightening</b> <b>her</b> spine and {{serving on the}} dance/cheer team. She spent summer semesters in Europe. Her studies included a filmmaking course. She graduated with honors in 2008.|$|R
50|$|Animation - Musical Interlude: A {{picture of}} Rodin's The Kiss appears, with the {{addition}} of several small holes along the woman's leg. The woman <b>straightens</b> <b>her</b> leg out, and the man plays her like an ocarina.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nothing {{makes me}} perspire,' said Mary. As she bumped the chair under the porch she <b>straightened</b> <b>her</b> long back. The {{exertion}} {{had given her}} a colour, and the wind had loosened a wisp of hair across her forehead. Miss Fowler glanced at her.|$|E
60|$|They {{turned the}} clothes back. Paul saw his mother {{like a girl}} curled up in her flannel nightdress. Quickly they made {{one half of the}} bed, moved her, made the other, <b>straightened</b> <b>her</b> nightgown over her small feet, and covered her up.|$|E
60|$|There {{are women}} as well as men who have learnt the art of a sociable silence. Josephine and Sarah {{finished}} their cigarettes and their coffee in a condition of reflective ease. Then Sarah stood up and <b>straightened</b> <b>her</b> hair in front of the mirror.|$|E
60|$|She {{left the}} room. Lucian {{sat down and}} gave his {{attention}} to Alice, who had still enough of her old nervousness to make <b>her</b> <b>straighten</b> <b>her</b> shoulders and look stately. But he did not object to this; a little stiffness of manner gratified his taste.|$|R
60|$|Minnie Rauskukle, plump, hearty Minnie, heiress to {{the general}} store, gave {{evidence}} by bridling and <b>straightening</b> <b>her</b> pigeon-like body that {{she was aware of}} Milt behind her. He did not speak to her. He ducked into the door of the Old Home Poolroom and Restaurant.|$|R
6000|$|... "Leave me go" [...] she whimpered in genuine alarm, {{and when}} at length she was {{released}} {{she went to}} the mirror and began <b>straightening</b> <b>her</b> hat, which had flopped to one side of her head. [...] "I didn't mean nothin', I was only kiddie' you--what's the use of gettin' nutty over a jest?" ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{those who}} watched this unwonted scene could not guess what Dea Flavia felt, for {{her eyes were}} veiled by her long lashes, and the mouth {{expressed}} neither triumph nor pity. Menecreta now once more tried to steady her quivering voice; she <b>straightened</b> <b>her</b> weary back and said quite calmly: ...|$|E
60|$|Already Irène had <b>straightened</b> <b>her</b> graceful figure, {{with a quick}} jerk as if she {{had been}} struck. The terrible affront must have taken her {{completely}} unawares, but now that it had come, she instantly guessed its cause. Nevertheless there was nothing daunted or bashful about her attitude. The colour blazed into her cheeks, and her fine dark eyes responded to Lydie's scornful glance with one of defiance and of hate.|$|E
60|$|Then she roused {{herself from}} her torpor: {{she did not}} know how long she had stood beside the open window, but the fear seized her that that man must have seen and gloated over the agony of her mind. She <b>straightened</b> <b>her</b> graceful figure, threw back her proud head defiantly, and quietly walked up to the table, where Chauvelin seemed once more absorbed in the perusal of his papers.|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "In Racial Shame at Bandung," [...] Wright {{discusses}} the unofficial {{presence of the}} African American US Congressman Adam Clayton Powell at the conference and situates US racism {{in relation to a}} Cold War political situation in which racism was becoming an international liability for the United States. Later in this section, Wright recounts the story of a fellow African American reporter, Ethel Payne, who was also reporting on the Bandung Conference and was apparently looking for some Sterno to <b>straighten</b> <b>her</b> hair. Wright believes that racial shame prompts <b>her</b> to <b>straighten</b> <b>her</b> hair. He also reports on “an intimate interview with one the best-known Indonesian novelists,” who is quoted as saying: “I feel inferior. I can’t help it. It is hard to be in contact with the white Western world and not feel like that.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dearest Branwen!" [...] exclaimed the princess, {{throwing}} {{back the}} old woman's shawl, <b>straightening</b> <b>her</b> up, and hugging {{her when they}} were alone, [...] "how long you have been coming! Where have you been? Why have you forsaken me? And I have such quantities of news to tell you--but, what has become of your hair?" ...|$|R
50|$|Initially after Mary Elizabeth {{was struck}} with this disease, {{her mother did}} her best to treat her but this was not enough. Reaching out to his friend, Mary Elizabeth’s father sought out {{consultation}} from Dr. Abraham Flexner in 1915. In 1916, Mary Elizabeth and her father traveled to Boston so she could receive care to <b>straighten</b> <b>her</b> back.|$|R
60|$|Tom, smoking {{his pipe}} and cuddling his youngest-born on his knees, dropped an eyelid surreptitiously {{on his cheek}} in token that Sarah was in a tantrum. Saxon devoted herself to tying a ribbon in the hair {{of one of the}} little girls. Sarah lumbered heavily about the kitchen, washing and putting away the breakfast dishes. She <b>straightened</b> <b>her</b> back from the sink with a groan and glared at Saxon with fresh hostility.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Madame Celandine {{would be}} {{surprised}} if she could see how I have treated one of her masterpieces,' said she, as she <b>straightened</b> <b>her</b> crushed hat, and arranged her hair with those quick little deft pats of the palm with which women can accomplish so much in so short a time. Rumpled finery sets the hands of every woman within sight of it fidgeting, so Maude joined in at the patting and curling and forgot all about her tears.|$|E
6000|$|Again [...] "Mascot" [...] crawled up, inch by inch. They were on {{the home}} stretch, they were equal, the cheering broke out, then silence, then another terrific burst, shouts, yells and clappings--"Mascot" [...] had won the free-for-all. In the front row a woman stood up, swayed and shaken as a leaf in the wind. She <b>straightened</b> <b>her</b> scarlet hat and readjusted her veil unsteadily. There was {{a smile on her}} lips and tears in her eyes. No one noticed her. A man beside her drew her hand through his arm in a quiet {{proprietary}} fashion. They left the grand stand together.|$|E
60|$|The girl {{drew her}} hand from his and <b>straightened</b> to <b>her</b> full height.|$|R
40|$|One {{might imagine}} Joanna Brooks 2 ̆ 7 s American Lazarus: Religion and the Rise of African-American and Native American Literatures in the {{tradition}} of Jones and Allen 2 ̆ 7 s historical record <b>straightening.</b> <b>Her</b> detailed, lucidly presented narrative of contexts, communities, and texts (including that of Jones and Allen) is notable not only for its thorough explication o...|$|R
6000|$|Jordan's face {{showed his}} relief. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "you {{have got to}} take the month at sea.
