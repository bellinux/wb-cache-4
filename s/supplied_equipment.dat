5|$|Deep sea diving is {{underwater}} diving, {{usually with}} surface <b>supplied</b> <b>equipment,</b> and often {{refers to the}} use of standard diving dress with the traditional copper helmet. Hard hat diving is any form of diving with a helmet, including the standard copper helmet, and other forms of free-flow and lightweight demand helmets.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice between}} scuba and surface {{supplied}} diving equipment {{is based on}} both legal and logistical constraints. Where the diver requires mobility and a large range of movement, scuba is usually the choice if safety and legal constraints allow. Higher risk work, particularly commercial diving, may be restricted to surface <b>supplied</b> <b>equipment</b> by legislation and codes of practice.|$|E
5|$|Ordered on 2 February 1932 {{under the}} 1930 Naval Programme, Defender was laid {{down at the}} Vickers Armstrongs yard in Barrow as Yard Number 674 on 22 June 1931, and {{launched}} on 7 April 1932. She was completed on 31 October 1932 having cost a total of £223,979, excluding the Admiralty <b>supplied</b> <b>equipment</b> such as guns, ammunition and wireless outfits. The ship was initially assigned to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean and made a brief deployment to the Persian Gulf and Red Sea in September–November 1933.|$|E
40|$|The sizing of <b>supply</b> <b>equipment</b> {{to meet a}} {{time varying}} demand is an {{important}} engineering problem. Optimal sizing of various <b>supply</b> <b>equipment</b> can reduce the overall cost of the supply system significantly. In this paper, the screening curve methodology, originally proposed for planning electrical power system, is extended to address various process system related problems: cost optimal sizing of various pumps to satisfy time varying water demand, ideal mix of various lighting options for a given lighting load, etc. These examples illustrate that the proposed methodology is a simple, versatile, and powerful tool for appropriately sizing various equipment to satisfy time varying demands during grassroots design. During debottlenecking, supply system is expanded; new <b>supply</b> <b>equipment</b> are installed along with appropriate utilisation of existing <b>supply</b> <b>equipment.</b> A methodology is proposed to address expansion planning of various <b>supply</b> <b>equipment</b> during debottlenecking and demonstrated using an example of debottlenecking an air conditioning system.

5|$|Forester {{was built}} by J. Samuel White at its Cowes {{shipyard}} under the 1932 Naval Programme. The ship was laid down on 15 May 1933, launched on 28 June 1934, as the eleventh ship to carry the name, and completed on 19 April 1935. The ship cost 248,898 pounds, excluding Admiralty <b>supplied</b> <b>equipment</b> such as armaments and communications sets. Forester was initially assigned to the 6th Destroyer Flotilla (DF) of the Home Fleet, but was sent to reinforce the Mediterranean Fleet, together with most of her sister ships, during the Abyssinian crisis in June and remained here until February 1936. She was deployed to Gibraltar in September–October 1937 during the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939. The ship then returned home {{and spent the next}} two years with the 6th DF. The flotilla was renumbered the 8th Destroyer Flotilla in April 1939, five months before the start of World War II. Forester remained assigned to it until June 1940, escorting the larger ships of the fleet.|$|E
5|$|Fury {{was built}} by J. Samuel White at its Cowes {{shipyard}} under the 1932 Naval Programme. The ship was laid down on 19 May 1933, launched on 10 September 1934, as the eleventh ship to carry the name, and completed on 18 April 1935. The ship cost 248,538 pounds, excluding Admiralty <b>supplied</b> <b>equipment</b> such as armaments and communications sets. Fury was initially assigned to the 6th Destroyer Flotilla (DF) of the Home Fleet, but was sent to reinforce the Mediterranean Fleet, together with most of her sister ships, during the Abyssinian crisis in June. On 11 December 1936, {{the day after his}} abdication broadcast to the nation, Fury embarked HRH The Duke of Windsor for passage to Boulogne-sur-Mer. After returning home, she remained there aside from deployments to Spanish waters to enforce the arms embargo imposed on both sides in the Spanish Civil War by the Non-Intervention Committee. The flotilla was renumbered the 8th Destroyer Flotilla in April 1939, five months before the start of World War II. Fury remained assigned to it until June 1940, escorting the larger ships of the fleet and conducting anti-submarine patrols.|$|E

25|$|In {{professional}} diving, solo diving {{is normal}} procedure when one diver {{is sufficient to}} perform the required task, particularly on surface <b>supplied</b> <b>equipment,</b> {{to the extent that}} it is not even noted as an exception. However, a standby diver is required at the surface or at the bell, and the working diver must be in communication with the supervisor at the surface. Procedures for the dive are based on assessed risk.|$|E
25|$|By {{the turn}} of the twentieth century, two basic {{architectures}} for underwater breathing apparatus had been pioneered; open-circuit surface <b>supplied</b> <b>equipment</b> where the diver's exhaled gas is vented directly into the water, and closed-circuit breathing apparatus where the diver's carbon dioxide is filtered from unused oxygen, which is then recirculated. Closed circuit equipment was more easily adapted to scuba in the absence of reliable, portable, and economical high pressure gas storage vessels.|$|E

25|$|Through water {{communications}} systems are {{more suitable for}} scuba as the diver is not encumbered by a communications cable, but they can be fitted to surface <b>supplied</b> <b>equipment</b> if desired. Most through water systems have a Push To Talk (PTT) system, so that high power is only used to transmit the signal when the diver has something to say. For commercial diving applications this is a disadvantage, in that the supervisor can not monitor the condition of the divers by hearing them breathe.|$|E
25|$|Several {{companies}} that produced network equipment were irrevocably {{damaged by the}} debt taken on to fund their expansion and went bankrupt, causing {{what is known as}} the telecoms crash. However, some communications {{companies that}} <b>supplied</b> <b>equipment</b> and outsourced manufacturing, such as Cisco and Qualcomm, were able to survive. Similarly, in Europe, mobile phone companies overspent on 3G licences, which led them deep into debt and led to the telecoms crash. The investments in infrastructure were far out of proportion to both their current and projected cash flow.|$|E
25|$|The {{assessed}} {{risk of a}} dive would {{generally be}} considered unacceptable if the diver {{is not expected to}} cope with any single reasonably foreseeable incident with a significant probability of occurrence during that dive. Precisely where the line is drawn depends on circumstances. Professional diving operations tend to be less tolerant of risk than recreational, particularly technical divers, who are less constrained by occupational health and safety legislation and codes of practice. This is one of the factors driving the use of surface <b>supplied</b> <b>equipment</b> where reasonably practicable for professional work.|$|E

2500|$|The {{most obvious}} hazards of ice diving are getting lost under the ice, hypothermia, and {{regulator}} failure due to freezing. Scuba divers are generally tethered for safety. This {{means that the}} diver wears a harness to which [...] a line is secured, and {{the other end of}} the line is secured above the surface and monitored by an attendant. Surface <b>supplied</b> <b>equipment</b> inherently provides a tether, and reduces the risks of regulator first stage freezing as the first stage can be managed by the surface team, and the breathing gas supply is less limited. For the surface support team, the hazards include freezing temperatures and falling through thin ice.|$|E
2500|$|An {{order was}} placed with Barningham and Co. in August 1893 for rails, {{sleepers}} and wagons for a [...] gauge railway system, {{which would be}} used to deliver lime to the lime store and carry the compressed sludge to the old river bed for disposal. Barningham had previously <b>supplied</b> <b>equipment</b> to the Corporation for a light railway on Carrington Moss for the Cleansing Department. Track laying was carried out by the Paving Sub Committee and Highways Department. The Corporation also paid the Ship Canal company to construct Davyhulme Wharf, which would enable coal and chemicals to be delivered to the site. This required the railway to be extended and a road to be built to serve the wharf, and this work was not completed until October 1894, although the works had begun to treat sewage in January 1894.|$|E
2500|$|When {{this success}} was {{achieved}} in 1858 the Galloways {{gave up their}} licensed rights, which had not been bought back as had {{those of the other}} licensees. They went instead into partnership with Bessemer, Robert Longsdon and William Daniel Allen (long-term business partners, and both of them his brothers-in-law) in building and operating his steel works in Sheffield. The business, established in 1859, was called Henry Bessemer & Co. and the capital input totalled around £12,000 with Bessemer and Longdon contributing £6,000, Allen contributing £500 and the Galloways £5,000. The partnership agreement was to be operational for 14 years. It initially produced steel at £10 to £15 cheaper per ton than had previously been possible, and later for around £45 less. The Galloways <b>supplied</b> <b>equipment</b> for its works– including tyre mills for the production of railway wheels– as well as, later, for other works which licensed the process, such as the Weardale Iron Company and John Brown of Sheffield.
