5|$|I {{think it}} is {{important}} that people <b>see</b> <b>that</b> spirituality is at the base of Nonviolent Communication, and that they learn the mechanics of the process with that in mind. It's really a spiritual practice that I am trying to show as a way of life. Even though we don't mention this, people get seduced by the practice. Even if they practice this as a mechanical technique, they start to experience things between themselves and other people they weren't able to experience before. So eventually they come to the spirituality of the process. They begin to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> it's more than a communication process and realize it's really an attempt to manifest a certain spirituality.|$|E

3000|$|When the item-total {{correlation}} {{values in}} the above table are examined, it is <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> items 5 and 10 in reading are relatively low in size. The coefficients obtained for other items in the construct of assessing reading were satisfactory. As for the construct of assessing listening, it is <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> the correlation value obtained for items 9, 10, and 13 in this subtest was relatively low and the other items had satisfactory values. The third construct was assessing writing and in this construct, it is <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> most of the items had low-level correlation values. Finally, the last construct of the scale was assessing speaking, and it is <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> the item-total correlation values obtained {{for most of the}} items are below [...]. 50 and relatively low in size.|$|R

25|$|Such {{externalities}} are {{a result}} of firms externalising their costs onto a third party in order to reduce their own total cost. As a result of externalising such costs we <b>see</b> <b>that</b> members of society will be negatively affected by such behavior of the firm. In this case, we <b>see</b> <b>that</b> an increased cost of production on society creates a social cost curve that depicts a greater cost than the private cost curve.|$|E
