Pakistan, <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia,</b> and Egypt helped China kill off a statement on the Xinjiang situation in the OIC. There has been no public reaction by the Arab League, <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> and Iran on the situation and China has built stronger relations with Iran and <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> due to their influence in the Islamic world.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1991 Gulf War, {{during which}} many U.S. Apaches {{operated}} from bases within Saudi territory, <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> purchased twelve AH-64As for the Royal Saudi Land Force.

In August 2006, the Saudi Arabian government began negotiations for Apache upgrades worth up to $400M, possibly remanufacturing their AH-64As to the AH-64D Longbow configuration. In September 2008, the U.S. Government approved the purchase of 12 AH-64Ds requested by <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia.</b> In October 2010, <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> requested a further 70 AH-64Ds {{as part of a}} possible, massive arms deal.|$|E

5|$|From his {{headquarters}} in Tampa, Schwarzkopf began planning the operations to defend <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia.</b> Lieutenant General Charles Horner, USAF, ran the headquarters in Riyadh. Schwarzkopf planned supply lines for the 50,000 troops initially sent to <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia,</b> tapping Major General William G. Pagonis {{as director of}} the logistical operations, with U.S. Air Force cargo aircraft landing supplies at Dhahran and U.S. Navy ships offloading troops and supplies at Dammam. By August 20, 20,000 U.S. troops were in <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia,</b> with another 80,000 preparing to deploy, and a further 40,000 reserves tapped to augment them. Schwarzkopf arrived at the CENTCOM command in Riyadh on August 25, and on August 29 he conducted his first front-line tour of the potential combat zone, accompanied by reporters. Over the next several weeks, Schwarzkopf spoke frequently with both reporters and troops under his command, conducting many high-profile press conferences and updates to the situation in <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia.</b> Schwarzkopf worked to help coordinate the contributions of the different nations contributing military forces to the effort. By mid-October, Schwarzkopf indicated he was confident the forces were of a sufficient level that they could defend <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> if it was attacked. Through October, Schwarzkopf and his command were occupied with setting up facilities and supply lines for the troops streaming into <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia.</b> He also worked to minimize the culture clash among foreigners in sharia-dominated <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia,</b> such as the high visibility of women in military roles. Schwarzkopf remained at his command in Riyadh through December, making frequent frontline visits to the troops. On December 29, 1990, he received a warning order from The Pentagon to be ready to attack into Iraq and Kuwait by January 17.|$|E

5|$|The current Saudi {{court system}} {{was created by}} King Abdul Aziz, who founded the Kingdom of <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> in 1932, and was {{introduced}} to the country in stages between 1927 and 1960. It comprises general and summary Sharia courts, with some administrative tribunals to deal with disputes on specific modern regulations. Trials in <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> are bench trials.

Now, only <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> remains openly opposed to the declaration.
