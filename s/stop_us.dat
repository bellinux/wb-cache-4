25|$|Bustamante {{implemented}} {{other measures}} to make immigration less desirable for Anglo-Americans. He rescinded {{the property tax}} law, which had exempted immigrants from paying taxes for tenyears. He further increased tariffs on goods entering Mexico from the United States, causing their prices to rise. The 1830s laws also brought settlement contracts under federal rather than state control. Colonies {{that did not have}} at least 150inhabitants would be canceled. Among the affected colonies were the Nashville Company run by Sterling C. Robertson and the Galveston Bay and Texas Land Company, run by David G. Burnet, Lorenzo de Zavala and Joseph Vehlein. Finally, he prohibited further immigration to Texas from the United States, although Anglos would still be welcome in other parts of Mexico. The ban and other measures did not <b>stop</b> <b>U.S.</b> citizens from migrating illegally to Texas by the thousands. By 1834, it was estimated that over 30,000Anglos lived in Texas, compared to only 7,800Mexicans.|$|E

It's just about not letting {{anything}} bring you down.|$|E

500|$|With {{over twenty}} years of {{parliamentary}} majorities, Liberal ministers did as they wished {{with little regard for}} the opposition parties. The Mackenzie King and St. Laurent governments laid the groundwork for the welfare state, a development initially opposed by many Tories. C.D. Howe, considered one of the leading forces of the St. Laurent government, told his Tory opponents when they alleged that the Liberals would abolish tariffs if the people would let them, [...] "Who would <b>stop</b> <b>us?...</b> Don't take yourselves too seriously. If we wanted to get away with it, who would stop us?" ...|$|E
500|$|In a November 2010 {{interview}} {{reported at}} NME.com, drummer Joey Kramer {{confirmed that the}} band had every intention to finish and release their long-delayed album in 2011, stating, [...] "Really, {{at this point in}} time, the only thing that's going to <b>stop</b> <b>us</b> is if someone out-and-out dies. Other than that, we've already been through what we've been through and stood the test of time. What else is there?" [...] On January 18, 2011, Tyler declared that [...] "Joe (Perry) has got some licks and I've got a bunch of songs that I've written for solo and/or Aerosmith" [...] and the band would start prepping the album that week.|$|E
500|$|The early 1950s saw {{an era of}} {{prosperity}} in Canada; in most years there was a government surplus. In 1951, the Government introduced an old age pension for Canadians to receive {{from the age of}} 70. With little unemployment and thus a surplus in the unemployment insurance fund, coverage was extended to seasonal workers, such as fishermen. St. Laurent's supervision of his ministers was minimal at the start of his tenure, and decreased as the years passed. With the Opposition few in numbers, ministers did as they wanted, and when Howe was accused by British Columbia Tory MP Howard Green in 1951 of being willing to end tariffs if the people would let him, Howe replied, [...] "Who would <b>stop</b> <b>us?</b> [...] Don't take yourself too seriously. If we wanted to get away with it, who would stop us?" ...|$|E

500|$|The bootcamp {{stage of}} the {{competition}} began on 22 July 2010 at Wembley Arena, London and was broadcast on 25–26 September. Minogue continued her maternity leave and Cole did not attend because {{she was still in}} recovery. As Cole and Minogue were absent, producers of the show decided to axe bootcamp's live audience. The bootcamp stage was broadcast in two episodes on 25 and 26 September. The first day of bootcamp saw Cowell and Walsh split the 211 acts into their four categories: Boys, Girls, Over 25s and Groups. They received vocal coaching and each category later performed one song: the Boys sang [...] "Man in the Mirror", the Girls sang [...] "If I Were a Boy", the Over 25s sang [...] "Poker Face" [...] and the Groups sang [...] "Nothing's Gonna <b>Stop</b> <b>Us</b> Now". At the end of the day, the number of acts was cut to 108. On the second day, acts were given dance lessons by creative director Brian Friedman but they were not judged on their performances.|$|E

500|$|Author Dorothy Hobson has {{discussed}} {{the use of}} older female characters in British soap opera {{as a means of}} providing comedy. She compares Ethel and Dot's function in EastEnders to the trio of Ena Sharples, Minnie Caldwell and Martha Longhurst from Coronation Street with regard to providing humour. She has noted that following Ethel's retirement from the serial, the production team at EastEnders attempted to replicate Dot and Ethel's friendship by introducing a number of [...] "'friends' to fulfill the same function of a female friend for Dot and the series." [...] An example of this was the character Lilly Mattock (Barbara Keogh) who appeared between 1998 and 1999. [...] The author goes on to note that Ethel's role in Dot's narrative was difficult to replace because [...] "far from being complete stereotypes, their relationships depend on them being long-standing friends with the ability to share stories and reminisce. For the characters to 'work', {{there is a need for}} unspoken intimacy and a shared knowledge for each other's lives. They carry the internal knowledge of the narratives and share that knowledge with the audience." [...] Brown has spoken about the [...] "wonderful rapport" [...] she had with Gretchen Franklin who played Ethel. She added, [...] "I do miss Ethel, it was great with Dot and Ethel. They did try and <b>stop</b> <b>us</b> working together at one time, but the producer changed and it all went back to where it started." ...|$|E
