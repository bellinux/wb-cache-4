30|$|In addition, {{by observing}} the fourth to <b>seventh</b> <b>rows,</b> {{we find out}} that the SIFT {{descriptor}} is superior to the SURF descriptor in terms of the precision. And from the eighth to eleventh rows, we observe that the moment invariants-based feature descriptors are all inferior to SIFT or SURF descriptors in terms of precision. Considering the definitions of recall and precision, a comparable recall value but extremely low precision value implies that there are too many False Positives (or false alarms).|$|R

In a chapter in his book, he describes ‘How to Place the Prince's Seat’, where ‘all the objects in the scene appear better... than from any other place’. It is located approximately {{in the middle of}} the <b>seventh</b> <b>row</b> and it is a coveted place.|$|R
50|$|The 1996 UEFA European Under-16 Championship was the 14th {{edition of}} UEFA's European Under-16 Football Championship. Austria hosted the championship, during April 29 - May 11, 1996. 16 teams entered the competition, and Portugal {{defeated}} France {{in the final}} to win the competition for the third time. Portugal was {{the first team to}} win the title two years in a <b>row</b> (<b>Spain</b> did it again in 2007 and 2008).|$|R

5|$|Ununennium and unbinilium ({{elements}} 119 and 120) are {{the lightest}} elements {{that have not}} yet been synthesized: all the preceding elements have been synthesized, culminating in oganesson (element 118), the heaviest-known element, which completes the <b>seventh</b> <b>row</b> of the periodic table. Attempts to synthesize elements 119 and 120 push the limits of current technology, due to the decreasing cross sections of the production reactions and their probably short half-lives, expected to be on the order of microseconds. Heavier elements would likely be too short-lived to be detected with current technology: they would decay within a microsecond, before reaching the detectors.|$|R
500|$|In {{presentations of}} the {{periodic}} table, the lanthanides and the actinides are customarily shown as two additional rows below {{the main body}} of the table, with placeholders or else a selected single element of each series (either lanthanum or lutetium, and either actinium or lawrencium, respectively) shown in a single cell of the main table, between barium and hafnium, and radium and rutherfordium, respectively. [...] This convention is entirely a matter of aesthetics and formatting practicality; a rarely used wide-formatted periodic table inserts the lanthanide and actinide series in their proper places, as parts of the table's sixth and <b>seventh</b> <b>rows</b> (periods).|$|R

Holdsworth's final lap left him fifteenth, alongside early pace-setter Caruso. Team-mates Moffat and Steven Johnson took sixteenth and seventeenth, alongside Todd Kelly in the second Jack Daniels' Racing car, in what would be his final appearance in a Holden, having injured his shoulder in a training accident that would force him to miss the final four races of the 2012 season, while his team would switch to fielding Nissan Altimas in 2013.|$|R

Map series in the Southern and Arctic zones span eight degrees of longitude, while those in the High Arctic zone span sixteen degrees of longitude. The NTS designates the southernmost set of map series, from 40 to 44 degrees north latitude, with numbers that end with the digit 0, using 10, 20, 30 and 40. The third row, ending with the digit 2, spans from 2, 12, 22, 32 and so on to 102 off the west coast, while the fifth, sixth and <b>seventh</b> <b>rows</b> extend furthest west, using 115, 116 and 117.|$|R
5|$|Ireland has {{finished}} first seven times, {{more than any}} other country, Ireland also won the contest for three consecutive years (1992, 1993, 1994), more consecutive years than any other country. Three countries have won twice in a <b>row,</b> <b>Spain</b> (1968 and 1969), Luxembourg (1972 and 1973) and Israel (1978 and 1979). Along with Switzerland's win in the first contest, Serbia is the only other country to win with its debut entry (in 2007), though Serbia had competed prior as part of Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro. Under the voting system used between 1975 and 2015, the winner of the contest was decided by the final voting nation on eleven occasions.|$|R
50|$|A period 7 {{element is}} one of the {{chemical}} elements in the <b>seventh</b> <b>row</b> (or period) of the periodic table of the chemical elements. The periodic table is laid out in rows to illustrate recurring (periodic) trends in the chemical behaviour of the elements as their atomic number increases: a new row is begun when chemical behaviour begins to repeat, meaning that elements with similar behaviour fall into the same vertical columns. The seventh period contains 32 elements, tied for the most with period 6, beginning with francium and ending with oganesson, the heaviest element currently discovered. As a rule, period 7 elements fill their 7s shells first, then their 5f, 6d, and 7p shells, in that order; however, there are exceptions, such as uranium.|$|R

60|$|It {{was about}} half-way {{through the first}} act that Jill, whose {{attention}} had begun to wander, heard a soft groan at her side. The seats which Freddie Rooke had bought were at the extreme end of the <b>seventh</b> <b>row.</b> There was only one other seat in the row, and, as Derek had placed his mother on his left and was sitting between her and Jill, the latter had this seat on her right. It had been empty at {{the rise of the}} curtain, but in the past few minutes a man had slipped silently into it. The darkness prevented Jill from seeing his face, but it was plain that he was suffering, and her sympathy went out to him. His opinion of the play so obviously coincided with her own.|$|R
50|$|Every driver {{used the}} option tyres {{in the second}} session apart from Pérez, who was {{prevented}} from setting a flying lap with a problem similar to Rosberg's. The Toro Rossos occupied the row in front of him, Sébastien Buemi ahead of Jaime Alguersuari by two tenths of a second; while {{there was a very}} similar story at Williams, with Rubens Barrichello in front of Pastor Maldonado on the <b>seventh</b> <b>row.</b> In the dying moments of the session, Kobayashi, Bruno Senna and Vitaly Petrov all set lap times quick enough to progress into the top ten. This meant that the Force Indias of Adrian Sutil and Paul di Resta would have to start eleventh and twelfth respectively. Lewis Hamilton set the fastest time of the session with Sebastian Vettel and Jenson Button not far behind.|$|R
5|$|The second {{qualifying}} period was fifteen minutes in length, {{and was used}} to set positions eleven through to sixteen. It was once again topped by Nico Rosberg, {{who was the first}} person to set a time under 1:43.000 all weekend. Meanwhile, Lewis Hamilton locked his brakes on the approach to turn 7, damaging his race tyres. Hamilton narrowly avoided elimination, setting a time good enough to proceed on his last attempt. Romain Grosjean was eliminated in eleventh, having overcome issues with his brake balance. Nico Hülkenberg was a surprise elimination in twelfth, having run consistently at the front of the field throughout the weekend. His elimination was attributed to a miscommunication between himself and his engineer over the amount of fuel he had on board. Carlos Sainz Jr. and Fernando Alonso finished thirteenth and fourteenth to fill the <b>seventh</b> <b>row</b> of the grid, ahead of Gutiérrez.|$|R
50|$|With {{increasing}} atomic number, {{the experimental}} difficulties of producing and identifying a new element increase significantly. In the 1970s and 1980s, resources for new element research at Berkeley were diminishing, but the GSI laboratory at Darmstadt, Germany, {{under the leadership}} of Peter Armbruster and with considerable resources, was able to produce and identify elements 107-109 (107, bohrium; 108, hassium and 109, meitnerium). In the early 1990s, the Berkeley and Darmstadt groups made a collaborative attempt to create element 110. Experiments at Berkeley were unsuccessful, but eventually elements 110-112 (110, darmstadtium; 111, roentgenium and 112, copernicium) were identified at the Darmstadt laboratory. Subsequent work at the JINR laboratory at Dubna, led by Yuri Oganessian, was successful in identifying elements 113-118 (113, nihonium; 114, flerovium; 115, moscovium; 116, livermorium; 117, tennessine and 118, oganesson), thereby completing the <b>seventh</b> <b>row</b> of the periodic table of the elements.|$|R
50|$|In the final, Denmark was {{up against}} hosting nation, Spain. The final became a horrendous game for Denmark, losing with a record-breaking 16 goals, and losing the title {{for the second time}} in a <b>row,</b> with <b>Spain</b> {{declared}} as winner of the tournament {{for the second time in}} history.|$|R
5000|$|L'œil du prince ("the prince's eye") is a French {{expression}} {{popularized by}} Nicola Sabbatini (1574-1654), an Italian stage designer and {{architect of the}} Renaissance in his famous treatise published in 1638. It is an imaginary point in the audience of a theatre, located in its central axis, approximately 0.6 m (18 inches) above the stage, and at a distance equal to the stage's width. In most theaters it corresponds more or less to the <b>seventh</b> <b>row</b> of seats. Sabbatini, in a chapter in his book, describes ‘How to Place the Prince’s Seat’, where [...] "all the objects in the scene appear better... than from any other place". It is considered the best place and the most coveted one in the audience, which was reserved for the nobility (thus the reference to the prince). Due {{to the importance of}} these spectators, of course, many theater shows had their main movements and happenings designed in order {{to attract the attention of}} the prince's eye.|$|R

5|$|Up to {{the late}} 19th century, chemists {{unanimously}} agreed that thorium and uranium were analogous to hafnium and tungsten; {{the existence of the}} lanthanides in the sixth row was considered to be a one-off fluke. In 1892, British chemist Henry Bassett postulated a second extra-long periodic table row to accommodate known and undiscovered elements, considering thorium and uranium to be analogous to the lanthanides. In 1922, Danish physicist Niels Bohr published a theoretical model of the atom and its electron orbitals, which soon gathered wide acceptance. The model indicated that the <b>seventh</b> <b>row</b> of the periodic table should also have f-shells filling before the d-shells that were filled in the transition elements, like the sixth row with the lanthanides preceding the 5d transition metals. The existence of a second inner transition series, {{in the form of the}} actinides, was not accepted until similarities with the electron structures of the lanthanides had been established; Bohr suggested that the filling of the 5f orbitals may be delayed to after uranium.|$|R
50|$|The {{race was}} {{dominated}} by Emerson Fittipaldi for the first 400 miles. During that stretch, several contenders retired due to mechanical failures, including all three Penske machines. Top-five contenders Bobby Rahal, Jim Crawford, and Arie Luyendyk also {{dropped out of the}} race. Mario Andretti experienced electrical problems, which caused him to lose significant ground to the leader. Michael Andretti, who had started in the <b>seventh</b> <b>row,</b> had been chasing Fittipaldi the entire race and by the 150 lap mark, he was within sights of the leader. Meanwhile, Al Unser, Jr. remained on the leap lap in third place, despite being lapped earlier in the race. By this point, the three leaders had significant distance on the fourth place car of Raul Boesel. With less than 100 miles to go, Michael Andretti passed Fittipaldi for the lead, but his engine expired a few laps later, ending the young Andretti's bid for an Indy 500 win. Fittipaldi regained the lead, with Al Unser, Jr. second. The remainder of the field ran at least six laps behind.|$|R
50|$|The {{remaining}} 17 drivers all {{participated in}} the second qualifying session, and all drivers {{decided to use the}} option tyres. The two Toro Rosso cars were slowest in Q2, Buemi ahead of teammate Jaime Alguersuari. Although, Alguersuari moved up to 16th and Kobayashi into 17th once Buemi was excluded form qualifying due to a fuel irregularity demoting him to 24th position. Mexican rookie Sergio Pérez out-qualified his teammate again with 15th spot, behind the two Williams cars; Pastor Maldonado not in Q3, yet ahead of F1 veteran Rubens Barrichello on the <b>seventh</b> <b>row.</b> Force India's Paul di Resta and Nick Heidfeld in the Renault were very close to making the cut, but were both beaten by their teammates and stayed 12th and 11th respectively. This was only the 3rd time in 10 races that Force India driver Adrian Sutil out-qualified his rookie teammate, and Vitaly Petrov's Renault entered the top 10 {{for the first time since}} Canada. Paul di Resta later said he suffered from grip problems in Qualifying.|$|R
