5|$|Scully {{decides to}} join Mulder in the game, {{and the two}} fight Maitreya together. Maitreya begins to {{duplicate}} herself, making the task of killing her more difficult. Finally, Maitreya sits atop a virtual tank and aims it at the agents. Phoebe admits there {{is one way to}} stop the game, but doing so will erase the entire program. Despite protests from Ivan, Phoebe gives Byers the kill command, effectively destroying Maitreya along with the game while saving Mulder and Scully. During Mulder's narration, we <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the control room one of the monitors is still active. There, Ivan sees Maitreya's avatar, but with Scully's face.|$|E
5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> spite of great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret {{the lack of any}} intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E
25|$|We <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> {{the total}} range of pressure, the pH is always largely lower than pKa2 {{so that the}} CO32− {{concentration}} is always negligible with respect to HCO3− concentration. In fact, CO32− plays no quantitative role in the present calculation (see remark below).|$|E

25|$|A Diocesan Bishop {{may have}} bishops who assist in his ministry. The Coadjutor Bishop of a see {{has the right}} of {{succession}} on the death or resignation of the Diocesan Bishop, and, if the see is an archdiocese, holds the title of Archbishop. Similarly, a retired Diocesan Bishop keeps his connection with the see {{to which he was}} appointed, and is known as Bishop (or Archbishop) Emeritus of that see. On the other hand, an Auxiliary Bishop, who may also hold posts such as vicar general or episcopal vicar, is appointed bishop of a titular see, a <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the course of history has ceased to exist as an actual jurisdictional unit.|$|E
25|$|I don't hate Islam. I {{consider}} it a backward culture. I have travelled much in the world. And wherever Islam rules, it's just terrible. All the hypocrisy. It's a bit like those old Reformed Protestants. The Reformed lie all the time. And why is that? Because they have standards and values that are so high that you can't humanly maintain them. You also <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> that Muslim culture. Then look at the Netherlands. In what country could an electoral leader of such a large movement as mine be openly homosexual? How wonderful that that's possible. That's something that one can be proud of. And I'd like {{to keep it that}} way, thank you very much.|$|E
25|$|With Zoey {{forced to}} kill him, the {{helicopter}} crash lands {{in an industrial}} district outside the city. Finding an armored delivery truck, the group uses it {{to make their way}} to the town of Riverside. However, they find the road blocked, and travel the rest of the way on foot. After an encounter with an infected lunatic in the local church, they discover that the town is overrun, and decide to head to a nearby boathouse for rescue. Contacting a small fishing vessel, they manage to reach the city of Newburg on the other side of the river, only to find much of it in flames. Seeking cover in a large greenhouse, their rest is interrupted when a military C-130 Hercules passes overhead, leading the survivors to travel through the city's business district towards Metro International Airport. Upon arrival, the group <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> an attempt to contain the infection, the military had bombed the airport while infected pilots crash planes in an attempt to land; the runway however is largely intact, allowing the survivors to fuel up and escape in a waiting C-130.|$|E

500|$|On how Wilkes {{connects to}} Carter, Austin said Wilkes is [...] "one {{of the top}} {{scientists}} in his field , but he’s {{had to work hard}} to get there. It’s sort of a similar struggle of an African-American and a woman in the 1940s to try to succeed, so I think that they both <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> one another and that’s part of where the chemistry and connection comes from." [...] Expanding on the love triangle that forms between Wilkes, Sousa, and Carter, Austin said, [...] "we’re very nice to each other. We’re professional. I think that Sousa likes Wilkes enough and it’s the same the other way".|$|E

[...] So we <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the traditional definition of the real numbers, the equation 0.9* = 1 is built in at the beginning." [...] A further modification of the procedure leads to a different structure where the two are not equal. Although it is consistent, many of the common rules of decimal arithmetic no longer hold, for example the fraction [...] has no representation; see [...] "Alternative number systems" [...] below.|$|E
500|$|Naughty Dog {{designed}} Elena as a sidekick and {{a romantic}} interest to Drake, and her personality to complement his. However, she proves just as capable as Drake at gun battles and resourcefulness. Her voice actor commented, [...] "In the first game, she's a lot younger, she's {{a lot more}} naive, and she looks at things as being very possible, {{and in the second}} (game), has seen murders and adventure...the way that any person grows, you <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> her. She's a little bit more hesitant, a little more cynical". Commentators have mentioned how unusually strong and resilient Fisher is for a female character, and GamesRadar UK called her one of the strongest heroines in video gaming.|$|E

In her own contemporaneous diary entry dated 15 January 1993, Fraser described herself more as Pinter's [...] literary midwife. Indeed, she told Billington that [...] "other people [...] had a shaping influence on [...] politics" [...] and attributed changes in his writing and political views to a change from [...] "an unhappy, complicated personal life... to a happy, uncomplicated personal life", so that [...] "a side of Harold which had always been there was somehow released.

500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{featurette}} {{published by}} HBO following the airing of the episode, David Benioff {{spoke about the}} revelation in King's Landing, and Tommen's decision to abolish [...] "trial by combat," [...] stating [...] "This moment is a grievous blow for Cersei because she's been counting on trial by combat really {{since the end of}} season five. This was always her ace in the hole, the Mountain was never going to lose a trial by combat there's no one out there who could beat him. And then Tommen takes it away from her and knowing really what he's doing. He might be a weak King, but he's not an idiot, he understands that this move is going to mean that she's probably not going to fare that well in this trial. So it's a pretty devastating moment for Cersei, and you <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> her reaction, and partly because it just bodes so ill for this coming trial, and partly because it's her own son who's really betrayed her." ...|$|E

I was up all night rocking that joint. [...] same lyrics, I just reproduced the track." [...] "The Darkchild Remix" [...] was initially being sent to radio stations in the United States in mid-March 2002 and then became the opening track of the compilation album Now That's What I Call Music! 10 later that year; however, it was only released on April 1, 2002. The remix was heavily played in dance clubs, and Jerkins said he wasn't surprised with the popularity of it, since [...] " [...] reinvented herself. Everybody thought she was gonna come back with another 'Oops!... I Did It Again', but she went left and came with the 'I'm a Slave 4 U' joint, which is basically a club banger. You gotta big up people who reinvent themselves. I always said she was gonna {{be one of the}} people that's gonna be around for a minute, because I <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> her." [...] Finnish musician and record producer Jaakko Salovaara also created two remixes for the track, titled [...] "JS16 Dub" [...] and [...] "JS16 Remix".
