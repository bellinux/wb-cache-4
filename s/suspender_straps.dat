40|$|Pre-trip Digital Voice Recorder (DVR) {{recording}} and upload Remember {{that use of}} the DVR is mandatory unless the unit fails to function or is damaged. Please use the provided script (Appendix I) to complete the recording before every trip. Included in the script are instructions detailing the steps you should follow to upload the pre-trip audio file before every trip. Completion of the pre-trip {{recording and}} upload will provide a refresher on proper use of the DVR. If {{you have any questions}} regarding the upload or voice recorder, or if you have any issues with your DVR, please contact Glenn Chamberlain (508 - 495 - 2153, business hours; 339 - 237 - 0791 after hours), Charles Dunlap (508 - 495 - 2035), or after hours tech help phone (508 - 367 - 8256). The DVR is an important component of lobster pot/trap biological sampling and you must understand how to operate the unit to sample properly. If you are scheduled to deploy on a lobster trip, you are required to complete this exercise prior to deployment. Completing this exercise provides the opportunity to address any issues with the DVR before the trip. DVR Maintenance 1. Place recorder in a protective case and secure, using a lobster band, to a <b>suspender</b> <b>strap</b> of your foul weather gear. 2. During colder months, place the recorder in an internal pocket to keep it warm so the batteries do not run down prema-turely. 3. It is important that the recorder does not get wet. 4. The buttons on the recorder have been known to freeze up from moisture so try to use the headset inline mute button when-ever possible. 5. Practice using the headset mute button through a protective cover (baggie) with gloves on. 6. Plan battery changes during lulls while setting traps, moving between strings, or during crew breaks (rare!). 7. Bring 2 - 3 batteries for day (inshore) trips and 10 - 16 for multi-day (offshore) trips. 8. Save old batteries and dispose of properly. Following each trip lightly wipe the recorder with a clean damp cloth. Spray the headset mute button with WD 40...|$|R
