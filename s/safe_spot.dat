25|$|In {{the opinion}} of the archaeologists, the Jamamasjid of present Bharuch is {{probably}} this ancient temple. It is believed that in times of such invasions the idol of Shri Prabhu was kept at a <b>safe</b> <b>spot,</b> and, as time passed, new temples were constructed and the old idols were installed. To-day the idol is found in the new temple. There are here eleven other temples besides this.|$|E

Four of these eight <b>safe</b> <b>spots</b> are starting points. The spaces protrude from the surface of the board, thereby allowing the cones to rest on them neatly.|$|R

60|$|The {{suffering}} {{youth was}} only too {{glad to have}} somebody come to his aid, and he put up both hands, and those on the rocks hauled him up and then aided him {{to get to a}} <b>safe</b> <b>spot</b> on shore.

50|$|During {{the period}} of the high empire, a number of rich mansions stood here but they were mostly {{destroyed}} during the barbarian invasions of the 5th century, resulting in the area being almost completely abandoned, {{with the exception of a}} few convents on the heights of the Aventine Hill, located on a <b>safer</b> <b>spot.</b> The district became again inhabited during the Renaissance, when sometime during the 16th century the river port called Ripa Grande was made operational once again.|$|R
60|$|The canoe was now {{thirty or}} forty yards from the rough bank, and {{drifting}} fast. Driscoll obviously meant to land {{on a patch of}} shingle lower down, which was the only <b>safe</b> <b>spot</b> for some distance. At low-water one could run a canoe aground among the ledges that bordered the slack inner edge of the rapid, but when the Shadow rose in flood the current broke and boiled furiously among the rocks. One faces forward when paddling, and while Thirlwell watched the dark gaps in the pines open up and close he heard Driscoll shout. Next moment Scott leaned over the bow and plunged his arm into the water. It {{looked as if he had}} dropped his paddle and Thirlwell backed his in order to stop the craft.|$|E
6000|$|... [4] [...] "On {{the visit}} of General Lafayette to this country, in 1824, {{he came over to}} Brooklyn in state, and rode through the city. The {{children}} of the schools turn'd out to join in the welcome. An edifice for a free public library for youths was just then commencing, and Lafayette consented to stop on his way and lay the corner-stone. Numerous children arriving on the ground, where a huge irregular excavation for the building was already dug, surrounded with heaps of rough stone, several gentlemen assisted in lifting the children to safe or convenient spots to see the ceremony. Among the rest, Lafayette, also helping the children, took up the five-year-old Walt Whitman, and pressing the child a moment to his breast, and giving him a kiss, handed him down to a <b>safe</b> <b>spot</b> in the excavation."--John Burroughs.|$|E
60|$|The strongest {{instinct}} of {{this animal}} is {{to clear the}} ground thoroughly about its burrows; {{and it is this}} destructive habit that makes it necessary for cultivators of the soil to destroy all the vizcachas in or near their fields. On the uninhabited pampas, where the long grasses grow, I have often admired the vizcachera; for it is there the centre of a clean space, often of half an acre in extent, on which there is an even close-shaven turf: this clearing is surrounded by the usual rough growth of herbs and giant grasses. In such situations this habit of clearing the ground is eminently advantageous to them, as it affords them a comparatively <b>safe</b> <b>spot</b> to feed and disport themselves on, and over which they can fly to their burrows without meeting any obstruction, on the slightest alarm.|$|E
60|$|The last hole {{had given}} Alexander the honour again. He drove even more {{deliberately}} than before. For quite {{half a minute}} he stood over his ball, pawing at it with his driving-iron like a cat investigating a tortoise. Finally he despatched {{it to one of}} the few <b>safe</b> <b>spots</b> on the hillside. The drive from this tee has to be carefully calculated, for, if it be too straight, it will catch the slope and roll down into the ravine.|$|R
5000|$|Wizard: The primary nuking class; these casters {{are able}} to deal catastrophic damage to enemies over {{a very short time}} from a distance, {{particularly}} with their Manaburn skill, although the length of encounters often makes manaburn inefficient to use. Wizards are considered to be the masters of teleportation, and have appropriate spells to facilitate group travel to certain locations, including designated <b>safe</b> <b>spots</b> when things turn sour for the whole group. A Wizard's direct damage spells are generally from the fire, frost, and magic schools.|$|R

60|$|To {{speak of}} their doings on this pilgrimage, of ingress and egress, of tangent and parallax, of {{external}} and internal contact, would avail nothing. Is it not all written in the chronicles of the Astronomical Society? More to the point will it be to mention that Viviette's letter to Cambridge had been returned long before he reached that place, while her missive to Marseilles was, of course, misdirected altogether. On arriving in America, uncertain of an address in that country at which he would stay long, Swithin wrote his first letter to his grandmother; and in this he ordered that all communications {{should be sent to}} await him at Cape Town, as the only <b>safe</b> <b>spot</b> for finding him, sooner or later. The equatorial he also directed to be forwarded to the same place. At this time, too, he ventured to break Viviette's commands, and address a letter to her, not knowing of the strange results that had followed his absence from home.|$|E
6000|$|Presently we Whitmans all {{moved up}} to Tillary street, near Adams, where my father, who was a carpenter, built a house for himself and us all. It was from here I [...] "assisted" [...] the {{personal}} coming of Lafayette in 1824-'5 to Brooklyn. He came over the Old Ferry, as the now Fulton Ferry (partly navigated quite up to that day by [...] "horse boats," [...] though the first steamer had begun to be used hereabouts) was then call'd, and was receiv'd {{at the foot of}} Fulton street. It was on that occasion that the corner-stone of the Apprentices' Library, at the corner of Cranberry and Henry streets--since pull'd down--was laid by Lafayette's own hands. Numerous children arrived on the grounds, of whom I was one, and were assisted by several gentlemen to safe spots to view the ceremony. Among others, Lafayette, also helping the children, took me up--I was five years old, press'd me a moment to his breast--gave me a kiss and set me down in a <b>safe</b> <b>spot.</b> Lafayette was at that time between sixty-five and seventy years of age, with a manly figure and a kind face.|$|E

5000|$|Garissa, in the North Eastern Province around 200 km {{from the}} border with Somalia, was {{considered}} as [...] "one of the <b>safest</b> <b>spots</b> in the region". It housed both military barracks and police headquarters. Al-Shabaab, a multi-ethnic militant group based in Somalia with links to Al-Qaeda, had killed over 200 people in Kenya {{in the two years}} prior to the event, in attacks like the 2013 Westgate shopping mall shooting. These attacks significantly affected Kenya's tourism industry, although prior to Al-Shabaab's existence, the 2002 Mombasa attacks also targeted tourists. Previously, many of the militant group's attacks were outside major urban population centers.|$|R

On larger rapids it is the guides responsibility to keep the raft from flipping in unsafe places. Some guides will flip on purpose in <b>safe</b> <b>spots,</b> where the term flip to tip comes from.|$|R

This party in the boat, nine in number, survived the storm of that awful night, and were picked up the following morning by a Montrose sloop. Of those left in the ill-fated ship some remained in the after-part; a few stationed themselves near the bow, thinking it the <b>safest</b> <b>spot.</b> The captain stood helpless, his wife clinging to him, while several other females gave vent to their agony of despair in fearful cries.|$|R
