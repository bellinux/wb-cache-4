Vehicular access to the Zabbaleen Mokattam is possible only through three entrances, two of which are accessible only by crossing through the crowded, narrow, and steep streets of Manshiet Nasser. Because of the high congestion and road traffic, conflicts between the residents of the Manshiet Nasser settlement and the Zabbaleen, who need to haul their donkey carts loaded with garbage through the streets of Manshiet Nasser have often broken out. Occasionally, these conflicts took on religious overtones, as the inhabitants of the Manshiet Nasser settlement are mostly Muslims, whereas the inhabitants of the Mokattam settlement are mostly Coptic Christians.|$|E

40|$|The thesis focuses {{the topic}} of <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements</b> located along borders in twin cities on the Amazon context. The study claims that Twin Cities are {{integrated}} by informality, in this case by <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements</b> along borders. In addition to the integration, these <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements</b> are transforming the border from a limit towards a social spatial construction of their territory. Based on that, the study looks for a cross border approach which can be developed by local governments of twin cities in order to manage <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements</b> along borders as a shared and common problem.  In order to develop the research, the study {{has been done in}} the case of Leticia (Colombia) and Tabatinga (Brazil) twin cities in the Amazon. The thesis is focused in a natural space which has been the border between these twin cities the San Antonio ravine. Along this “natural” limit between Colombia and Brazil has been taken place an occupation of <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements</b> that has transformed the international limit into an “informal” urban space. The thesis developed two approaches in order to study the mentioned case of <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements</b> located along borders in twin cities. First, the study developed a bottom up approach analysing socioeconomic and physical characteristics of <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements</b> inhabitants and comparing both <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements</b> based on fieldwork findings. The comparative study looks for symmetric and asymmetric issues between both <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements</b> which are a key output towards a cross border approach between the twin cities based on needs and characteristics of <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements</b> inhabitants in the Amazon context.  On the other hand, the study developed a review of urban policies of Colombia and Brazil looking for aspects that can be taking into account for local government of Leticia and Tabatinga in their local policies for managing <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements</b> on flood prone lands located on the border’s fringe. In addition, the study made a review of the current frontiers policies of both countries in order to find key elements that can used by local government for developing a cross border cooperation for managing <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements</b> in a cooperation and integration framework. Finally, the study looks for a short and long term appropriate approach for managing these two <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements</b> located along the border between the Leticia and Tabatinga twin cities. The recommendations for both terms can be useful input for future housing policies, and urban planning and management instruments in the twin cities based on Amazon characteristics. Moreover, the research methodology developed in the study can be an appropriate research procedure for further urban studies in Leticia and Tabatinga twin cities, especially on <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements</b> along border’s fringe.

40|$|In {{precarious}} environments, such as <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements,</b> sustainability can {{be achieved}} as an economic resource. It is important, however, to start with assuring {{a sense of belonging}} in the members of the communities. Through observation in <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements</b> and conversations with their inhabitants, this paper presents a view on informal sustainability through participative processes. We argue that if we begin by looking at cultural sustainability, people’s sense of belonging becomes a key factor in taking care of the environment. We aim to demonstrate that even if <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements</b> are regarded as areas of conflict in terms of pollution, occupation of the land, and waste disposal, through informal processes people can achieve a degree of awareness that will not only result in sustainable practices, but that can also propose new creative ways to achieve them, with economical considerations in mind...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{developing}} countries like India, {{the number of}} slums and <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements</b> are increasing particularly in large cities. Mysore City {{one of the large}} cities in India and there are large number of slums and <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements.</b> Kudremala slum is one of the <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements</b> and the housing and development of infrastructure was not addressed by the Karnataka Slum Clearance and Improvement Board due to its land tenure problem for quite a long time. Kudremla had 120 households when the project was initiated. The innovative housing project was initiated by the local community jointly with the Non-government organisation by mobilising funds from international funding agency SELVIP and government agencies. The paper presents the processes of innovative approaches to cost effective housing in Kudremala slum through partnership of CBO and NGO, resource mobilisation efforts and use of cost effective technology including the self-help techniques in promoting housing and development of infrastructure...|$|R
25|$|There {{was a lack}} of {{good housing}} and a {{proliferation}} of <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements.</b> Combined with the high unemployment rate, this led to social problems from crime, a low standard of living, and unrest. The other deleterious effect of <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements</b> was that many of these were built of highly flammable materials, were poorly constructed and thus posed a high fire risk. A prominent example in this case is the Bukit Ho Swee Squatter Fire that broke out in 1961. In addition, there was poor sanitation, which led to the spread of infectious diseases.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – slums and <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements</b> are the {{physical}} manifestation of urban poverty, {{the root cause}} of the origin and growth being urban-rural migration, economic inequality and over all development of the country. Over crowding, no housing or dilapidated/sub standard houses, lack of proper light and drainage etc, are the common problems in slum areas. The urban community development (UCD) cell was established in 1967 in the Hyderabad and has been implementing urban poverty alleviating programs. The Draft National Housing Policy in 1998, adopted by the government for the betterment of living condition instead of “slum clearance” approach to that of “ slum improvement”. In this scenario, two clear-cut approaches emerge for tackling {{the physical}} and social problems of the slums and <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements.</b> So the main aim is to improve the environmental conditions of the poor, promoting health, safety and better living with the help of Geographical Information Systems as a tool.

40|$|Urbanisation of Pacific {{cities is}} causing {{substantial}} growth in <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements,</b> particularly in Fiji. This growth in <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements</b> is placing government resources under stress {{in terms of}} affordable housing solutions and extension of essential services on government capacities. Furthermore, unregulated urbanisation processes are leaving many <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements</b> living {{below the poverty line}} and placing settlers increasingly under survival pressures. Many have studied the various poverty and social dynamics affecting <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements</b> in Fiji as well as the government and non-government institutional responses to these situations. This thesis addresses how the urban poor in settlements marshal the necessary resources to organise inclusive and effectual communities that can influence public policy directions on issues that affect them. The assumption in this thesis considers that squatters face significant cultural and ideological barriers that either support or block their ability to function adequately in their challenging settings. Furthermore, this thesis explores the impacts of culture, religion and lived experiences on urban community development processes and how these experiences may affect the socio-economic well-being of community members. This research was based on primary data collection from a sample of eighteen householders across three contrasting <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements</b> in Suva, Fiji, during 2008. Householders were surveyed with application of a structured and internationally authenticated social capital-integrated questionnaire. The survey was used to investigate settlers‟ perceptions of the various organisational and social cohesion indicators in communities considered necessary to support community functioning. Of particular interest was the relative significance and importance of key social capital indicators. Social capital was seen as prerequisite for community development in a Fijian, Indo-Fijian and an integrated settlement. This thesis investigated how people might work together to sustain socially cohesive communities. The community organisational and interactive data indicators were analysed to compare the capacity assessment results and presented in a visual format to provide a „snapshot in time‟ of the status of community relations in the <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements</b> studied. It is contended that this approach could present a potential application for communities, government institutions and development practitioners to employ as an instrument to monitor the progress of community capacity development in future...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an evaluation}} of site and service projects as a strategy for meeting the housing needs for the low-income households in Nairobi, Kenya. These projects were {{an attempt by the}} government to help low-income households by increasing the housing stock available to these kinds of households.;The major source of data was from interviews conducted over a period of five months in the large Dandora project in Nairobi. Here, information was gleaned on changes in socio-economic, housing and migratory variables.;The data confirmed that the project significantly improved the housing conditions of those who moved. The project, however, did not directly meet the housing need of the low-incomes group because of the high housing costs of this project. The Dandora project benefited {{only a small percentage of}} residents from the <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements</b> and these characteristically earned higher incomes than were intended for this project. The analysis showed that the project mainly benefited respondents who had moved from standard housing (housing constructed with permanent materials and approved by the City Council). However, this does not necessarily indicate the failure of this housing strategy because the benefits to the ill housed in the <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements</b> could have been indirect ones resulting from filtering. The survey determined that 85 percent of those moving from standard housing left vacancies that could have benefited low-income households through filtering. An analysis of the migratory history of those surveyed indicated that most of the respondents had moved from the rural areas to standard housing prior to Dandora and not from the <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements,</b> suggesting that even with the second tier moves included, the site and service schemes 2 ̆ 7 direct impact on the City 2 ̆ 7 s <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements</b> was limited.

In this regard, 70 per cent of the urban population of Ethiopia is living in slums and <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements.</b> This article is on accessibility of land for residential purpose and existing <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements</b> in Burayu town in Oromia National Regional State, Ethiopia. The population of Burayu town is 100, 200 (2010) and the town is located about 15 kilo meters from the city limits of Addis Ababa metropolis, the capital of Ethiopia.
