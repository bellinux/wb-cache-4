The main purpose of grid-synchronization algorithms is to estimate the positive- and negative-sequence components of the utility voltage under unbalanced and distorted condition. The existing most advanced phase-locked loop (PLL) and frequency-locked loop (FLL) methods are well known method for grid-synchronization. The fundamental variable estimated by the PLL is the grid-phase angle, whereas the grid frequency is the one for the FLL. The most extended technique used for grid synchronization in three-phase three wire system is a <b>synchronous</b> <b>reference</b> <b>frame</b> PLL (SRF-PLL). The SRF-PLL works accurately during balanced condition, but cannot estimate voltage components during unbalanced condition.
