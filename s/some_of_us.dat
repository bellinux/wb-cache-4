5|$|The {{only reason}} the Nazis put on {{prisoner}} broadcasts {{is to get}} people justifiably anxious about relatives reported missing at the front {{to listen to their}} propaganda. Although many of the messages undoubtedly are true, they represent but a small fraction of our prisoners and we have no assurance that many of them are not faked from papers picked up on the battlefield. What concerns <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> is the consequences of listening to Nazi broadcasts unless you are a well-trained listener (and often, even if you are). Nazi arguments often sound plausible. A person may listen to them with all the skepticism in the world, knowing that every word is a lie. But if the content is sufficiently sensational (and it often is) the source may be forgotten in time, and out pops the Nazi lie, all unsuspecting.|$|E
25|$|I {{believe that}} 95 {{percent of us}} agree that the workers should control the industries.

25|$|A famous puzzle {{in human}} {{genetics}} is the genetic ability to taste phenylthiocarbamide (phenylthiourea or PTC), a morphism which {{was discovered in}} 1931. This substance, which to <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> is bitter, and to others tasteless, is of no great significance in itself, yet it is a genetic dimorphism. Because of its high frequency (which varies in different ethnic groups) it must be connected to some function of selective value. The ability to taste PTC itself is correlated {{with the ability to}} taste other bitter substances, many of which are toxic. Indeed, PTC itself is toxic, though not at the level of tasting it on litmus. Variation in PTC perception may reflect variation in dietary preferences throughout human evolution, and might correlate with susceptibility to diet-related diseases in modern populations. There is a statistical correlation between PTC tasting and liability to thyroid disease.|$|E
25|$|I cannot {{understand}} why we idle discussing religion. If we are honest—and scientists have to be—we must admit that religion is a jumble of false assertions, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God {{is a product of}} the human imagination. It is quite understandable why primitive people, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling. But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can't for the life of me see how the postulate of an Almighty God helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> want to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit. Religion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards—in heaven if not on earth—all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of all mortal sins.|$|E
500|$|Of the Chicago {{production}} at American Theater company, Chicago Tribune theatre critic Chris Jones praised {{the show as}} [...] "intensely arresting." [...] Time Out Chicago Kris Vire called the play [...] "a compact, stunning gut punch addressing the cultural affinities <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are allowed to escape and those we aren't." [...] However, Chicago Sun-Times critic Hedy Weiss noted that the plays five characters were all [...] "identity-warped", and the show was a [...] "minefield... that feels all too deliberately booby-trapped by the playwright." [...] The play won the Jeff Award—honoring excellence in Chicago Theater—for Best New Play in Chicago 2012.|$|E

500|$|While {{writing the}} scene with Meredith and Shepherd fighting, Rater {{explained}} that she was intending to show how they matured, adding: [...] "This is a real grown-up argument. Meredith isn't running away, getting all dark and going to Cristina for help getting out of her marriage. She's staying and fighting." [...] While writing the episode, writers intended {{the theme of the}} episode to be [...] "exposure", but after the episode was filmed, realized it was [...] "ambition". Rater commented on this: [...] "Derek wants to be Chief; Meredith wants to do a procedure that she knows she isn’t ready for; Cristina wants Teddy to stay." [...] In the episode, Oh's character asked her fellow residents if they would choose love or surgery, if need be, with Stevens choosing love and Yang and Meredith choosing surgery. The Grey Anatomy staff offered the insight: [...] "When we were first discussing this story we had a knock down drag out fight in the writers' room – if you had to choose your love or your art, which would you choose? And <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> came down on the Cristina side, and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> came down on the Izzie side – that in the end love is all that matters." [...] At the conclusion of the episode, Karev ended his marriage to Stevens. Rater expressed that the writers decided to have the fictional couple break-up, because Stevens wasn't sick anymore, and Karev would not have left her when she was.|$|E
500|$|With {{his career}} on hold, Hunt {{continued}} recording new songs and demos, posting {{them on his}} MySpace page, while Popular gained exposure among listeners through online music sharing. In 2009, he released the compilation album Use in Case of Emergency as a free download through his website. It featured previously unreleased material recorded by Hunt prior to Popular. He also continued touring, worked on an autobiographical book of short stories, entitled Tales of Friction, and studied classical piano. Hunt also took up photography after his girlfriend purchased him a camera. He started {{out on the streets}} of Los Angeles, where he photographed subjects on street corners and discarded objects, including furniture and numerous couches he found abandoned on the streets. In an interview for PopMatters, he explained how his photographying of people there inspired him: [...] "It's sad as you can quite imagine. It's also kind of welcoming to me. Sometimes I do get {{a chance to talk to}} them and hear a bit of their story. I'm not the only one out here who had an idea of trying to make it happen. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are luckier than others. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are more prepared than others. That's just the truth of the situation." [...] Along with photography, he was stimulated creatively after reading Legs McNeil's 1997 book Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral History of Punk and relating to its themes of artistic frustration and rebelliousness.|$|E
500|$|During the {{broadcast}} run of The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., TV Guide featured a positive {{review of the}} show in its Couch Critic column and wrote, [...] "It's as funny as it is exciting, which {{is not an easy}} combo to pull off... it's fresh and funny and different, and that's why we like it." [...] The magazine twice listed Brisco as a family-friendly TV program: [...] "Back when <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> grew up, Westerns were synonymous with great family entertainment, but– let's be honest– some of them were dull as dust. Not this one. Brisco is a Western with a sense of humor, filled with impish action for kids and adults." ...|$|E

500|$|Hanna, on McKinley's behalf, {{met with}} the eastern Republican {{political}} bosses, such as Senators Thomas Platt of New York and Matthew Quay of Pennsylvania, {{who were willing to}} guarantee McKinley's nomination in exchange for promises regarding patronage and offices. McKinley, however, was determined to obtain the nomination without making deals, and Hanna accepted that decision. Many of their early efforts were focused on the South; Hanna obtained a vacation home in southern Georgia where McKinley visited and met with Republican politicians from the region. McKinley needed 453½ delegate votes to gain the nomination; he gained nearly half that number from the South and border states. Platt lamented in his memoirs, [...] " [...] had the South practically solid before <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> awakened." ...|$|E
500|$|Concerned {{about the}} plight of fellow ex-servicemen, whose {{businesses}} were often failing, Gellibrand banded together with like-minded individuals to form the Hobart Remembrance Club. This organisation aimed to support ex-servicemen by providing employment and support for their businesses. The Hobart Club inspired the formation of Legacy Australia in Melbourne, which over time became a national movement, expanding its scope to the care of ex-servicemen's widows and their families. The Hobart Club did not join Legacy until 1940, but Charles Bean wrote in 1944 that [...] "coming back to the great and good man from whose original work it all sprang—there was a time when <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> thought that the best monument to John Gellibrand might be the story of Second Bullecourt. Now I feel there will be an even better—the record of Legacy." ...|$|E
500|$|Kelly drank a lot; saxophonist Jimmy Heath {{described}} him as [...] "an alcoholic" [...] who [...] "could control his drinking" [...] and not let his playing be affected by it. Kelly was known [...] "for being a very warm, generous human being". Bassist Bill Crow reported that Kelly was [...] "full of fun": [...] "He was often the center of backstage laughing sessions as we told stories on each other. Wynton had a removable upper front denture. While on stage, if he saw <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> standing in the wings listening, he would turn around so the audience couldn't see, give us a stern look, and drop his upper plate forward onto his lower lip, creating a grotesquely comical effect. Sometimes he heightened it by sticking his tongue out at us over his upper teeth." ...|$|E

The band initially dismissed a number of songs, since the material wasn't [...] "taking us anyplace new. We really wanted to grow musically with this [...]" [...] They pushed themselves, trying to write the best songs they could. According to Mascherino, the group [...] "didn’t spend as much time playing together in order to do exactly what we wanted to because <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> were new." ...|$|E
500|$|After marrying actress Jennifer Garner in 2005, and {{welcoming}} their first child, Affleck began a career comeback in 2006. Following {{a starring role}} in the little-seen Man About Town and a minor role in the crime drama Smokin' Aces, Affleck won acclaim for his performance as George Reeves in the noir biopic Hollywoodland. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised [...] "an award-caliber performance ... This is feeling, nuanced work from an actor <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> had prematurely written off." [...] Geoffrey Macnab of The Guardian said he [...] "beautifully" [...] captured [...] "the character's curious mix of charm, vulnerability and fatalism". He was awarded the Volpi Cup at the Venice Film Festival and {{was nominated for a}} Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor. Also in 2006, he made a cameo in Smith's Clerks II. Although they remain fans of each other's work, Affleck and Smith have had little contact since the making of Clerks II.|$|E
500|$|Barbirolli's {{repertoire}} {{was not as}} wide as that of many of {{his colleagues}} because he insisted on exhaustive preparation for any work he conducted. His colleague Sir Adrian Boult liked and admired Barbirolli but teased him for his meticulousness: [...] "We can't all be like you and spend months studying these things and then have days of rehearsals before we conduct them. For <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> they're only sporting events." [...] Barbirolli was shocked by such levity. His approach was illustrated by the care he took with Mahler's symphonies. His biographer Michael Kennedy commented, [...] "it is ironical that the effort of composing the symphonies shortened Mahler's life; interpreting them certainly put an enormous strain on Barbirolli in his last decade." [...] He found that mastering a Mahler symphony took between 18 months and two years, and he would spend hours meticulously bowing all the string parts in preparation for his performances. His first performance of Mahler's Ninth took nearly 50 hours of rehearsal.|$|E

500|$|Leng {{has named}} Living in the Material World as his {{personal}} favourite {{of all of}} Harrison's solo albums. According to Leng, with its combination of a defiant [...] "protest" [...] song in [...] "The Day the World Gets 'Round", the anti-stardom [...] "The Lord Loves the One", and [...] "perfect pop confections" [...] in [...] "Give Me Love" [...] and [...] "Don't Let Me Wait Too Long", Living in the Material World was the last album to capture the same clear-sighted, utopian spirit that characterised the 1960s. Eder likewise welcomes Material Worlds bold idealism, saying: [...] "Even {{in the summer of}} 1973, after years of war and strife and disillusionment, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> were still sort of looking – to borrow a phrase from a Lennon–McCartney song – or hoping to get from them something like 'the word' that would make us free. And George, God love him, had the temerity to actually oblige..." ...|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, the British press {{remained}} {{quiet on}} the subject until Alfred Blunt, Bishop of Bradford, gave a speech to his diocesan conference on 1 December, which alluded to the King's need of divine grace: [...] "We hope that he is aware of his need. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> wish that he gave more positive signs of his awareness." [...] The press took this for the first public comment by a notable person on the crisis and it became front page news the following day. When asked about it later, however, the bishop claimed he had not heard of Simpson {{at the time he}} wrote the speech. Acting on the advice of Edward's staff, Simpson left Britain for the south of France two days later in an attempt to escape intense press attention. Both she and the King were devastated by the separation. At a tearful departure, the King told her, [...] "I shall never give you up." ...|$|E
500|$|The Goodison Road Stand was {{partially}} demolished and rebuilt during the 1969–70 season with striking images of both {{old and new}} stands side by side. The new stand opened 1971, {{at a cost of}} £1 million. The new stand housed the 500 and 300 members clubs and an escalator to the tallest stand in the ground—the Top Balcony. However, not everyone thought that the upgrade was necessary at the time. Journalist Geoffrey Green of The Times wrote [...] "Goodison Park has always been a handsome fashionable stage for football, a living thing full of atmospherics-like a theatre. And now it has stepped into the demanding seventies with a facelift it scarcely seemed to need compared with <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> I know. New giant stands in place of the old; the latest in dazzling floodlight systems that cast not a shadow. A cathedral of a place indeed, fit for the gods of the game." ...|$|E
