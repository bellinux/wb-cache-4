500|$|Blue throat: The epithet [...] (Sanskrit nīla = [...] "blue", [...] = [...] "throat"). Since Shiva {{drank the}} Halahala poison churned {{up from the}} Samudra Manthan to {{eliminate}} its destructive capacity. Shocked by his act, Parvati <b>squeezed</b> <b>his</b> neck and stopped it in his neck {{to prevent it from}} spreading all over the universe, supposed to be in Shiva's stomach. However the poison was so potent that it changed the color of his neck to blue.|$|E
500|$|Sensitive {{about his}} weight, Daniel Lambert {{refused to allow}} himself to be weighed, but {{sometime}} around 1805, some friends persuaded him to come with them to a cock fight in Loughborough. Once he had <b>squeezed</b> <b>his</b> way into their carriage, {{the rest of the}} party drove the carriage onto a large scale and jumped out. After deducting the weight of the (previously weighed) empty carriage, they calculated that Lambert's weight was now , and that he had thus overtaken Edward Bright, the [...] "Fat Man of Maldon", as the heaviest authenticated person in recorded history.|$|E

2500|$|After the U.S. Army {{captured}} the bridge, {{during the next}} week they lined up anti-aircraft artillery of every description, virtually bumper to bumper to protect the bridgehead. On the afternoon of Wednesday, 7 March, Captain Carlton G.

2500|$|The arresting {{officers}} beat Louima {{with their}} fists, nightsticks, and hand-held police radios {{on the ride}} to the station. On arriving at the station house, he was strip-searched {{and put in a}} holding cell. The beating continued later, culminating with Louima being sexually assaulted in a bathroom at the 70th Precinct station house in Brooklyn. Volpe kicked Louima in the testicles, and while Louima's hands were cuffed behind his back, he first grabbed onto and <b>squeezed</b> <b>his</b> testicles and then sexually assaulted him with a broomstick. According to trial testimony, Volpe then walked through the precinct holding the bloody, excrement-stained instrument in his hand, bragging to a police sergeant that he [...] "took a man down tonight." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 18 September 1877 in Benalla, Kelly, while drunk, {{was arrested}} for riding over a {{footpath}} and locked-up for the night. The next day, while he was escorted by four policemen, he absconded and ran, taking refuge in a shoemaker's shop. The police and the shop owner tried to handcuff him but failed. During the struggle Kelly's trousers were ripped off. Trying to get Kelly to submit and taking advantage of his torn trousers, the Irish-born Constable Thomas Lonigan, whom Kelly later murdered at Stringybark Creek, [...] "black-balled" [...] him (grabbed and <b>squeezed</b> <b>his</b> testicles). During the struggle, a miller walked in, and on seeing the behaviour of the police said [...] "You {{should be ashamed of}} yourselves."

2500|$|Work at Ball Research brought Widlar {{in contact}} with Jean Hoerni and Sheldon Roberts, the creators of {{radiation}} hardened transistors and co-founders of Fairchild Semiconductor. Widlar {{decided to move to}} a semiconductor manufacturing company, and in 1963 Jerry Sanders, a Fairchild Semiconductor salesman, provided him the opportunity. According to Thomas Lee, Fairchild also wanted to have Widlar on board, and breached professional ethics by recruiting a key employee of their customer. In September 1963 Widlar was invited for an interview with Fairchild research and development (R) manager Heinz Ruegg. Widlar arrived at the interview intoxicated, and frankly told Ruegg what he thought about Fairchild's analog circuits: [...] "What they are doing is bullshit". Widlar was sent to another interview with the company's Applications Engineering division, which was based in Mountain View, California. The division head, John Hulme, hired Widlar despite objections from the first round interviewers. Widlar's first assignment at Fairchild targeted IC reliability through adjustments in fabrication processes. This early work, directed by process engineer David Talbert, reduced the price of planar process and made possible development of monolithic (fully integrated) linear ICs. Widlar, who formally reported to John Barrett, proved himself capable of quickly improving Barrett's own designs and very soon <b>squeezed</b> <b>his</b> nominal boss out of the company.|$|E
