Although they are still somewhat expensive, you should also consider the savings that you can obtain by eliminating many of the switches, potentiometers, etc. that the touch-screen can replace.

Soon afterward, MikroElektronika started selling 4. 3 ” TFT display boards based upon this new controller.

Writing any data larger than a single byte that spanned page boundaries would cause the data to wrap around {{to the beginning of the}} page. The likelihood of this occurring was slim - no one has reported it to date. However, just in case, this has now been squashed in this release. Deprecations: Going forward the ATTiny 85 is no longer officially supported. The library no longer supports using the page number + offset combination instead of addresses. If your code requires you to use a page number + offset combination, use the following code to helpaddress = (pagenumber << 8) + offset. The constructor no longer takes the pageOverflow variable as an argument. Page overflow is globally enabled by default and can be disabled by including a "#define DISABLEOVERFLOW" at the beginning of SPIFlash. h.
