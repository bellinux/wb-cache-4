2500|$|The arch was {{dedicated}} by Humphrey on May 25, 1968. He {{declared that the}} arch was [...] "a <b>soaring</b> <b>curve</b> in the sky that links the rich heritage of yesterday with the richer future of tomorrow" [...] and brings a [...] "new purpose" [...] and a [...] "new sense of urgency to wipe out every slum." [...] "Whatever is shoddy, whatever is ugly, whatever is waste, whatever is false, will be measured and condemned" [...] {{in comparison to the}} Gateway Arch. About 250,000 people were expected to attend, but rain canceled the outdoor activities. The ceremony had to be transferred into the visitor center. After the dedication, Humphrey crouched beneath an exit as he waited for the rain to subside so he could walk to his vehicle.|$|E
5000|$|In 1994 Anna Kisselgoff {{described}} Blossom's {{tribute to}} her mentor Nikolais after his death: [...] "Here, she is the tattered clown with a suitcase, gazing at a shattered Styrofoam mannekin. Reassembling the figure, she swept it into a <b>soaring</b> <b>curve.</b> but this was only a remembrance of poetic time past, a strong tribute {{to the death of}} an artist." ...|$|E

50|$|The stadium {{itself is}} home to Singapore Armed Forces FC/Warriors FC during the S-league {{football}} season. The stadium has become familiar for its elegant and <b>soaring</b> <b>curved</b> white steel roof, with supporting pylons, that covers the main grandstand.|$|R
25|$|The {{northern}} face of Haystacks is {{topped by}} crags which giving a <b>soaring</b> <b>curved</b> profile from {{the settlement of}} Gatesgarth at their base. On the left in this view is Green Crag, while the highest section, unnamed on Ordnance Survey maps is called Big Stack by Wainwright. Warnscale Beck, one of the feeder streams of Buttermere, runs down beneath Green Crag from its source near Great Round How. There are the remains of extensive quarries on the upper slopes of Warnscale, including Dubs, once served by a tramway from the summit of Honister Pass. Across Warnscale is Fleetwith Pike, a satellite of Grey Knotts.|$|R
5000|$|Furness, {{son of the}} Unitarian {{minister}} William Henry Furness, {{experimented with}} some of the ideas from his contemporaneous First Unitarian Church of Philadelphia (1883-86). Both churches had <b>soaring</b> <b>curved</b> roof trusses, vividly colored walls, and high windows that bathed the sanctuary in natural light. For St. Michael's, Furness chose royal-blue ceilings and Etruscan-red walls accented with metallic-gold trim, a color scheme that he had used to dramatic effect at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. [...] "Furniss" [...] (as the church historian misspelled the architect's name) also designed the church furniture [...] - [...] altar, pews, etc. [...] - [...] possibly fabricated by his frequent collaborator, Daniel Pabst. The blower for the Johnson & Son pipe organ (Op. 572, 1882) was housed in the base of the bell tower, and its pipes were stencilled with stylized flowers in colors that recalled Pennsylvania Dutch folk art.|$|R
500|$|According to AllMusic {{reviewer}} Heather Phares, Taking Back Sunday [...] "sometimes {{comes off}} as less than distinctive, and the album can sound like a generic soundtrack to generic teenage angst." [...] Phares called Where You Want to Be [...] "definitely a solid album... but crafting {{something a little more}} unique would take Taking Back Sunday's music that much farther." [...] On Chart Attack, despite the album's being [...] "overwrought" [...] its [...] "quality songwriting and some killer arrangements conceal Where You Want to Bes occasional off-the-chart cheese readings." [...] Although Drowned in Sound writer Mat Hocking expected the album {{to be one of the}} [...] "grittiest, most emotionally driving punk-pop records of the year," [...] it turned out to be [...] "an album that's playing it far too safe: melodies rise and fall, <b>soaring</b> and <b>curving</b> with painful predictability." ...|$|R
40|$|The ambitious late Gothic vaults {{created in}} the 15 th and 16 th centuries with their complex shape and {{complicated}} meshes of ribs <b>soaring</b> along spatial <b>curves,</b> were extremely demanding in their geometric design. This regards both {{the design of the}} whole structure, as also the design specifications for the single stone elements which were prefabricated and fit together on the building site with astonishing precision. In consequence, the particular character of these structures and their geometric features are intrinsically linked to the design routines and the geometric concepts used by the Master Builders. At present, these procedures and methods are not well understood, because they are not documented in original drawings, and because they differ in principle from the modern practice. In consequence, necessary works of repairing and restoring cannot recur to any information related to the original design. Moreover, understanding the characteristics of information transfer from the design to the execution, would cast a light on the information society in which these constructions were created. In several case studies, the geometric concepts of the intricate spatial curve systems of late Gothic vaults have been clarified on the basis of detailed surveys and geometrical analyses carried out on the built objects. On this background, also the existing sources such as historical design treatises could be re-interpreted. In a collaboration between the research group working on the design principles of late Gothic vaults at the Technische Universität Dresden, and expert stone masons specialized on historical working techniques and practical stereotomy at the Cathedral Workshop Œuvre Notre-Dame de Strasbourg, the phases of the design process, such as full-scale drawings on the tracing floor and the production of full-scale models and samples of ribs and keystones, are currently investigated in practical experiments. As result, we propose a complete picture of the design process from the general concept to the setting-out of the single stone elements. Further, we are able to drive general considerations on the Late Medieval and Early Modern design practice for stone structures and trace a new interpretation of the early treatises of stereotomy...|$|R
