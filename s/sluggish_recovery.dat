5000|$|Before the dissolution, {{there was}} notable {{dissatisfaction with the}} {{decision}} to dissolve within the LDP, because the LDP and its government partner, New Kōmeitō, feared losing their majority in the lower house, which chooses the Prime Minister. In the previous lower-house election (2003) and upper-house election (2004), the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) had performed handsomely, while the LDP was barely able to keep its majorities with a reduced number of seats despite the popularity of Koizumi. Election analysts ascribed the poor performance of the LDP to Koizumi's reforms that have eroded its traditional supporters such as farmers, [...] "Mom-Pop" [...] shop owners and construction workers, because the reforms, including deregulation and tax cuts, were tuned to help big global corporations like Toyota. Many in the LDP, among whom was Yoshiro Mori, former prime minister and Koizumi's long-time backer, showed a concern that the widening splits between Koizumi and the rebels within his party would help the competing DPJ candidates win seats in highly contested districts. At {{the height of the}} protest, Koizumi even had to dismiss a member of his Cabinet when he refused to sign the Imperial Ordinance for dissolution. There had also been concern that the so-called [...] "political vacuum", created if both the LDP and the DPJ fail to gain a clear majority, would impede the already <b>sluggish</b> <b>recovery</b> of the Japanese economy.|$|E

40|$|Among the stylised {{facts of}} {{economic}} transformation in East Central Europe {{are the following}} unpleasant developments-: the reemergence of fiscal deficits, the resilliance of medium inflation, and <b>sluggish</b> output <b>recovery.</b> This paper reviews the major interpretations found in the literature, including structuralist and demand-led approaches, and argues specifically against macroeconomic policy reversal. The concept of soft budget constraints for the state owned enterprise sector is used to develop an institutional interpretation of macroeconomic imbalances in the transformation process. Appropriate indicators of budget softness are derived and applied to the Polish evidence. The results {{support the hypothesis that}} current macroeconomic policy concerns are related to the continuing tolerance of loss making firms. The causes of soft budget constraints are found in perverse incentives in the financial sector, unclarified ownership rights, and the political reluctance to face large scale unemployment.

The data show relatively small and limited balance sheet adjustment - especially for those households considered the most likely to have been impacted by the economic collapse. The adjustment that did occur typically raised households' liquid asset holdings and/or saving and reduced their risky asset positions (stocks).

Overall, the findings are inconsistent with major adjustments occurring in households' balance sheet behavior - especially to the extent where these shifts would have contributed substantially to the <b>sluggish</b> economic <b>recovery...</b>|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} much {{discussion}} about the <b>sluggish</b> economic <b>recovery</b> out of the recent recession.

This paper uses Vector Autoregression (VAR) to analyze the employment gap in the United States over the past six decades. Unlike previous studies, it accounts for the most recent recession while also addressing alternative explanations - trade and globalization, government employment, the housing market, and the sectoral mix of the U.

40|$|ABSTRACT 12 This paper {{deals with}} the 20 -year (1988 - 2008) record of macroinvertebrate {{sampling}} from the UK’s 13 Acid Waters Monitoring Network. At 12 of the 22 sites a significant temporal trend in the 14 macroinvertebrate community is now evident. Indices of acidification suggest biological recovery at 15 five of the 11 streams sites and at five of the lakes. All 10 sites indicating biological recovery from 16 acidification also showed an increase in acid-neutralising capacity (ANC), although a further seven 17 sites showed chemical (ANC) recovery but no evident biological recovery. On a site-by-site basis 18 eight (four streams and four lakes) of the 20 sites investigated had significant relationships between 19 biotic indices of acidification and chemical measures of acidity, the latter explaining between 30 % 20 and 72 % of the biotic variation. Thus, the match between chemical and biological recovery is 21 incomplete, with biological recovery lagging improvements in chemistry, modest community changes 22 and most sites still showing signs of acid stress. The <b>sluggish</b> biological <b>recovery</b> may be ascribed to 23 aspects of the chemical environment that are still deleterious and/or to ecological inertia in the 24 reassembly of an acid-sensitive fauna. 2...|$|R

This generates a recession followed by a <b>sluggish</b> <b>recovery.</b> Conversely, an increase in fundamental volatility induces a short-lived recession and an expansion in the medium run.

40|$|In {{response}} to acute {{disruption of the}} permeability barrier of aged mammals there is a diminished capacity for barrier recovery, analogous to other aged organs when stressed. Acute barrier disruption increases levels of epidermal cytokines, and cytokines are known regulators of keratinocyte mitogenesis, as well as lipid synthesis in extracutaneous tissues. Underlying the <b>sluggish</b> barrier <b>recovery</b> in aged skin are diminished mRNA and protein levels for the interleukin- 1 cytokine family, and its receptors. To further elucidate {{the role of the}} interleukin- 1 family of cytokines in the barrier repair response, cytokine production was stimulated in aged murine skin with topical imiquimod application.

Furthermore, intracutaneous injections of interleukin- 1 α accelerated barrier recovery in aged mice. Finally, we showed that interleukin- 1 α added to cultured human keratinocytes stimulates epidermal lipid synthesis.

40|$|The {{housing sector}} {{has been one}} of the weakest links in the {{economic}} recovery, and the latest data continue to show only modest improvement. One obstacle to a pickup in housing demand has been tight mortgage credit standards. Indeed, loan standards for borrowers with lower credit scores have shown few signs of easing. Still, as the share of new mortgages financed in the private market has started to rise, access to credit may improve. Speaking about the broader economy in 2012, then-Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke referred to a number of unusual conditions that were impeding a return to normal growth. Two of these so-called headwinds were related to the <b>sluggish</b> housing <b>recovery.</b> The first was a debt overhang problem. Debt levels grew during the 2001 – 06 housing boom. But when growth prospects for house prices and income diminished during the recession, the debt remained, which may have weighed on consumer demand for all sorts of goods and services, including housing. The second housing-related headwind was the tightening of credit availability from lenders. The housing boom in the early 2000 s has often been attributed to an easing of the credit supply for all borrowers (see Mian and Sufi 2014). Relative to conditions during the boom, tighter constraints for borrowers after the recession could simply be part of a normalization in household credit markets. But they could also reflec...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{the wake}} of the end-Permian mass extinction, the Early Triassic (~ 251. 9 to 247 million years ago) is portrayed as an {{environmentally}} unstable interval characterized by several biotic crises and heavily depauperate marine benthic ecosystems. We describe a new fossil assemblage—the Paris Biota—from the earliest Spathian (middle Olenekian, ~ 250. 6 million years ago) of the Bear Lake area, southeastern Idaho, USA. This highly diversified assemblage documents a remarkably complex marine ecosystem including at least seven phyla and 20 distinct metazoan orders, along with algae. Most unexpectedly, it combines early Paleozoic and middle Mesozoic taxa previously unknown from the Triassic strata, among which are primitive Cambrian-Ordovician leptomitid sponges (a 200 –million year Lazarus taxon) and gladius-bearing coleoid cephalopods, a poorly documented group before the Jurassic (~ 50 million years after the Early Triassic). Additionally, the crinoid and ophiuroid specimens show derived anatomical characters that were thought to have evolved much later. Unlike previous works that suggested a <b>sluggish</b> postcrisis <b>recovery</b> and a low diversity for the Early Triassic benthic organisms, the unexpected composition of this exceptional assemblage points toward an early and rapid post-Permian diversification for these clades. Overall, it illustrates a phylogenetically diverse, functionally complex, and trophically multileveled marine ecosystem, from primary producers up to top predators and potential scavengers. Hence, the Paris Biota highlights the key evolutionary position of Early Triassic fossil ecosystems in the transition from the Paleozoic to the Modern marine evolutionary fauna {{at the dawn of the}} Mesozoic era...|$|R
