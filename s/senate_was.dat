Burton resigned from office on June 4, 1906, before the Senate could act.|$|E

5|$|Flanders's {{voting record}} in the <b>Senate</b> <b>was</b> more {{conservative}} than his senior colleague, George Aiken, and reflected Flanders's business orientation. In his second term, a Republican majority allowed Flanders to obtain seats on the Joint Economic Committee—this committee acted in an investigatory and advisory capacity to both Houses of the Congress—the Finance Committee and the Committee on Armed Services. These assignments reflected his interests as a senator.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy's staff drew up {{detailed}} {{plans for}} a candidacy in the 1984 presidential election that he considered, but with his family opposed and his realization that the <b>Senate</b> <b>was</b> a fully satisfying career, in late 1982 {{he decided not to}} run. Kennedy campaigned hard for Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale and defended vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro from criticism over being a pro-choice Catholic, but Reagan was re-elected in a landslide.|$|E
5|$|Local Republican Party leaders invited Garfield {{to enter}} {{politics}} upon {{the death of}} Cyrus Prentiss, the presumptive nominee for the local state senate seat. He was nominated by the party convention on the sixth ballot, and was elected, serving until 1861. Garfield's major effort in the state <b>senate</b> <b>was</b> a bill providing for Ohio's first geological survey to measure its mineral resources, though it failed.|$|E

5|$|Mathias {{remained}} {{active in}} his final days in the Senate, playing {{an important role in}} removing a death penalty provision in a 1986 Senate drug bill after threatening filibuster, and in preparing impeachment proceedings against federal judge Harry E.

5|$|On May 30, 2014, The Hill {{reported}} that the <b>Senate</b> <b>was</b> expected to consider legislation related to the VA scandal {{during the week of}} June 2, 2014. Their legislation was expected to address both the need to improve the healthcare that was being provided to veterans and the poor management of the Department of Veterans Affairs.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Senate</b> <b>was</b> the {{predominant}} political {{institution in the}} Roman Republic. The Senate's authority derived primarily from custom and tradition. It {{was also one of}} the few places in which free political discussion could take place. The Senate's principal role was as an advisory council to the consuls on matters of foreign and military policy, and it exercised a great deal of influence over consular decision-making.|$|E

5|$|After Harrison led Indiana's Republican {{delegation}} at the 1880 Republican National Convention, he {{was considered}} the state's presumptive candidate for the U.S. Senate. He gave speeches in favor of Garfield in Indiana and New York, further raising his profile in the party. However, when the Republicans retook {{the majority in the}} state legislature, Harrison's election to a six-year term in the U.S. <b>Senate</b> <b>was</b> threatened by Judge Walter Q. Gresham, his intra-party rival, but Harrison was ultimately chosen. After Garfield's election as president in 1880, his administration offered Harrison a cabinet position, but Harrison declined in favor of continuing his service in the US. Senate.|$|E
5|$|After further refusals {{from the}} USAF and DoD {{to provide the}} four {{officers}} for interview, Roth's committee gave the DoD and USAF until 14:30 on 31 October 1996 to provide the officers. The deadline passed without the officers appearing before the board. The next day the board sent senate subpoenas directly to the USAF headquarters office at the Pentagon, which refused to accept them. After learning that the <b>senate</b> <b>was</b> now planning to individually serve the four subpoenas directly to the four officers, the associate chief of the Air Force litigation division accepted the subpoenas.|$|E
5|$|As word {{increased}} of Bayh's intentions, {{political scientists}} opined on the detractions of a run. Citing {{the fact that}} his eight years as governor may be nullified by its distance in time and that his visibility in the <b>Senate</b> <b>was</b> low, critics pondered whether moderate voters may be more inclined to line with possible candidate Mark Warner of Virginia. However, this criticism subsided once Warner decided against a run in October 2006.|$|E

5|$|Davis's renewed {{service in}} the <b>Senate</b> <b>was</b> {{interrupted}} in early 1858 by an illness that began as a severe cold and which threatened him {{with the loss of}} his left eye.

On the Fourth of July, Davis delivered an anti-secessionist speech on board a ship near Boston. He again urged the preservation of the Union on October 11 in Faneuil Hall, Boston, and returned to the Senate soon after.|$|E
5|$|Desha's {{trial began}} January 17, 1825, in Cynthiana. William K. Wall, Commonwealth's Attorney for Harrison County, was the prosecutor, {{assisted}} by Fleming County Commonwealth's Attorney (and future Congressman) John Chambers and Martin P. Marshall. Rowan, {{who had just}} been elected to the U.S. <b>Senate,</b> <b>was</b> Desha's primary defense counsel, assisted by the governor's Secretary of State (and later U.S. Senator) William T. Barry, former Congressman William Brown, T. P. Taul, and James Crawford. It took two days to empanel a jury. Witness testimony consumed the next week, and Governor Desha attended each day of the trial. The closing statements of Rowan and Barry, both known as outstanding orators, took several days, and Chambers spoke last.|$|E
5|$|During 1895, Robert S. Hatcher, {{the reading}} clerk of the Indiana <b>Senate,</b> <b>was</b> {{directed}} {{to ascertain the}} legal status of the design of the state seal. After a thorough review, Hatcher found that the laws that authorized the seal did not explicitly state what its design should be. He recommended that a bill be passed to standardize the seal. Senator McCord submitted legislation for that purpose, but no action was taken on it.|$|E

5|$|Following Whitman's {{resignation}} and DiFrancesco's departure, John O. Bennett served as acting governor {{for three and}} a half days. During that time, he signed a few bills into law, gave a State of the State Address, and held parties at Drumthwacket, the New Jersey governor's mansion. Similarly, Richard J. Codey served as acting governor as well. Because control of the New Jersey State <b>Senate</b> <b>was</b> split, resulting in two Senate co-presidents, Codey and Bennett, each held the office of acting governor for three days. Perhaps this spectacle as much as any other factor led to the voters' decision to amend the state constitution to create the office of Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|In Star Wars and History {{published}} by Lucasfilm, it describes Palpatine's consolidation of power as being {{similar to the}} Roman political figure Augustus, named Octavian before renaming himself. Both legitimized authoritarian rule by saying that corruption in the <b>Senate</b> <b>was</b> hampering {{the powers of the}} head of state; both pressured the Senate to grant extraordinary powers to deal with a crisis, falsely claiming that they would rescind those powers once the crisis was over; and both relied on their strong control over military force.|$|E
5|$|Meetings {{could take}} place either inside or outside of the formal {{boundary}} of the city (the pomerium), though the official meeting place, or curia was at {{the centre of the}} Roman forum. The president of the <b>Senate</b> <b>was</b> normally one of the consuls, but it could be called to meet by any of the praetors or tribunes, both of whom had the authority to call the Senate, though praetors rarely did so unless the consuls were away and the tribunes almost never did so. Meetings were suffused in religious ritual. Temples were a preferred meeting site and auspices would be taken before the meeting could commence.|$|E
