5|$|In 2007, a {{researcher}} remarked that only little technical {{information is available}} about lenses, shutters and {{the speed of the}} photographic media, but reported that Neubronner obtained the film for his panoramic camera from ADOX. For this camera he estimated a film speed of ISO 25/15°–40/17° and a <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> of 1/60s–1/100s. The film was cut to the format 30mm×60mm and bent into a concave shape to prevent unnecessary distortion due to the half-circle movement of the lens.|$|E

25|$|From the Riga to Minox B, {{the film}} counter counts up to 50, while from Minox BL, C, to TLX, the film counter counts down from 36/30/15. For {{mechanical}} Minox 8x11 cameras, a separate <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> dial sets the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> from 1/2 to 1/1000 second, plus B and T (BL has no documented T). For electromagnetic shutter cameras, the shutter dial starts with 1/15 sec, {{and ends with}} 1/1000 (Minox C), or starts with 1/30 and ends with 1/2000 (Minox LX/TLX/CLX); the electromagnetic Minox camera also has an 'A' setting for automatic exposure, controlled by the built-in CdS (Minox C) or Spd (Minox LX/TLX) exposure meter.|$|E
50|$|<b>Shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> do not factor into {{guide number}} {{calculations}} and, {{for the most}} part, {{have no effect on}} electronic flash exposures. See Effect of <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds,</b> below.|$|R
50|$|Faster <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> are {{achieved}} by the second curtain closing before the first one has fully opened; {{this results in a}} vertical slit that travels horizontally across the film. Faster <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> simply require a narrower slit, as the speed of travel of the shutter curtains is not normally varied. Using this technique, modern SLR cameras are capable of <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> of up to 1/2000, 1/4000 or even 1/8000 of a second.|$|R
5000|$|Because leaf {{shutters}} synchronized electronic flash at all <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> {{especially at}} fast <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> of [...] {{of a second}} or faster, cameras using leaf shutters were more desirable to studio photographers who used sophisticated studio electronic flash systems.|$|R
25|$|Aperture {{priority}} is a semi-automatic shooting mode used in cameras. It permits the photographer to select an aperture setting {{and let the}} camera decide the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> and sometimes also ISO sensitivity for the correct exposure. This is {{also referred to as}} Aperture Priority Auto Exposure, A mode, AV mode (aperture-value mode), or semi-auto mode.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} way as one f-stop {{corresponds}} to a factor of two in light intensity, shutter speeds are arranged so that each setting differs in duration by a factor of approximately two from its neighbour. Opening up a lens by one stop allows twice as much light to fall on the film in a given period of time. Therefore, to have the same exposure at this larger aperture as at the previous aperture, the shutter would be opened for half as long (i.e., twice the speed). The film will respond equally to these equal amounts of light, since it has the property of reciprocity. This is less true for extremely long or short exposures, where we have reciprocity failure. Aperture, <b>shutter</b> <b>speed,</b> and film sensitivity are linked: for constant scene brightness, doubling the aperture area (one stop), halving the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> (doubling the time open), or using a film twice as sensitive, has the same effect on the exposed image. For all practical purposes extreme accuracy is not required (mechanical shutter speeds were notoriously inaccurate as wear and lubrication varied, with no effect on exposure). It is not significant that aperture areas and shutter speeds do not vary by a factor of precisely two.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, the perp walks {{dates back}} more than a century, to when cameras' <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> became fast enough to allow {{photography}} {{of a small group}} of individuals walking. It is believed to have been done even prior to Theodore Roosevelt's tenure as New York City police commissioner in the 1890s. The city's newspaper photographers soon ritualized it. J. Edgar Hoover, the first director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), made sure the press could witness his agents bringing accused gangsters Alvin Karpis and Harry Campbell to justice.|$|E

25|$|Between 1878 and 1884, Muybridge perfected {{his method}} of horses in motion, proving {{that they do}} have all four hooves off the ground during their running stride. In 1872, Muybridge settled Stanford's {{question}} with a single photographic negative showing his Standardbred trotting horse named Occident, airborne at the trot. This negative was lost, but the image survives through woodcuts made at the time (the technology for printed reproductions of photographs was still being developed). He later did additional studies, as well as improving his camera for quicker <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> and faster film emulsions. By 1878, spurred on by Stanford to expand the experiments, Muybridge had successfully photographed a horse at a trot; lantern slides have survived of this later work. Scientific American was among the publications at the time that carried reports of Muybridge's ground-breaking images.|$|E
25|$|All manned {{landings}} {{happened during}} the lunar daytime. Thus, the stars were outshone by the sun and by sunlight reflected off the Moon's surface. The astronauts' eyes were adapted to the sunlit landscape around {{them so that they}} could not see the relatively faint stars. Likewise, cameras were set for daylight exposure and could not detect the stars. Camera settings can turn a well-lit background to black when the foreground object is brightly lit, forcing the camera to increase <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> so that the foreground light does not wash out the image. A demonstration of this effect is here. The effect is similar to not being able to see stars from a brightly lit car park at night – the stars only become visible when the lights are turned off. The astronauts could see stars with the naked eye only when they were {{in the shadow of the}} Moon.|$|E

2500|$|An {{example of}} the use of f-numbers in {{photography}} is the sunny 16 rule: an approximately correct exposure will be obtained on a sunny day by using an aperture of 16 and the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> closest to the reciprocal of the ISO speed of the film; for example, using ISO 200 film, an aperture of 16 and a <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> of 1/200 second. The f-number may then be adjusted downwards for situations with lower light. Selecting a lower f-number is [...] "opening up" [...] the lens. Selecting a higher f-number is [...] "closing" [...] or [...] "stopping down" [...] the lens.|$|E

2500|$|The {{aperture}} stop of a photographic lens {{can be adjusted}} to control the amount of light reaching the film or image sensor.

[...] Typically, a fast shutter will require a larger aperture to ensure sufficient light exposure, and a slow shutter will require a smaller aperture to avoid excessive exposure.|$|E

2500|$|Serial time encoded amplified {{microscopy}} (STEAM) is an {{imaging method}} that provides ultrafast <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> and frame rate, by using optical image amplification {{to circumvent the}} fundamental trade-off between sensitivity and speed, and a single-pixel photodetector to {{eliminate the need for}} a detector array and readout time limitations [...] The method is at least 1000 times faster than the state-of-the-art CCD and CMOS cameras. Consequently, it is potentially useful for a broad range of scientific, industrial, and biomedical applications that require high image acquisition rates, including real-time diagnosis and evaluation of shockwaves, microfluidics, MEMS, and laser surgery.|$|E
2500|$|When {{images are}} {{acquired}} from locations with large differences in openness (for example, closed canopy locations and canopy gaps) {{it is essential}} to control camera exposure. If the camera is allowed to automatically adjust exposure (which is controlled by aperture and <b>shutter</b> <b>speed),</b> the result is that small openings in closed conditions will be bright, whereas openings of the same size in open conditions will be darker (for example, canopy areas around a gap). This means that during image analysis the same-sized holes will be interpreted as [...] "sky" [...] in a closed-canopy image and [...] "canopy" [...] in the open-canopy image. Without controlling exposure, the real differences between closed- and open-canopy conditions will be underestimated.|$|E
2500|$|The {{outline design}} of the F24 camera {{was carried out by}} the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough, and it was {{introduced}} in 1925. Detailed design, and most production, was by Williamson Manufacturing Company Ltd of Willesden Green, London NW.10. The F24 was designed to be lighter and smaller than the F8 camera of 1919, but the F8 continued to be used in less demanding installations. The main component units of the F24 are a body with roller blind focal plane shutter, gearbox, film magazine, and lens cone. Image film format is 5"×5", on 5" [...] wide roll film, with magazine capacity up to 250 exposures (the F8 offered images up to 8"×7.5" [...] on 9" [...] wide film). <b>Shutter</b> <b>speed</b> is preset between 1/100s and 1/1000s.|$|E

He set his camera for a lens setting between f/8 and f/11 and the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> at 1/400th second. Then, {{out of the corner}} of his eye, he saw six Marines start to raise the second flag. He swung his camera around toward the action and pushed the shutter. Three feet to his right, Sgt. Genaust captured the flag-raising from nearly the same angle using color motion picture film. To make sure he had a worthwhile photo to send to the AP, Rosenthal took another black and white photograph showing four of the second flag-raisers steadying the flagstaff waiting for the bottom of the pipe to be more secured with rocks; and afterwards a rope. When that was done, Rosenthal gathered a group of sixteen Marines and two Navy corpsmen around the base of the flagstaff for a posed shot (called the [...] "Gung Ho" [...] photo) which included First Lieutenant Harold Schrier, the only officer on the summit, who had volunteered to take the 40-man patrol up Mount Suribachi that morning to seize and occupy the crest and raise the battalion's flag.|$|E

40|$|Introduction In {{the real}} world, the scene may contain some well-illuminated {{areas as well}} as some areas that are in the darkness. The dynamic range of the scene, or the {{radiance}} ratio between the brightest and the darkest spots, can be quite big [...] it can span several orders of magnitude in some cases. This is a lot wider range than the range that our digital camera can adequately capture, and that our monitor can adequately display. The areas that are too bright for the dynamic range of our camera are going to be saturated on our image, and the areas that are too dark will be under-exposed. In both cases, all the information about these areas will be lost in the image. A way to solve this problem is to combine different <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> of our camera. Smaller <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> can give us good information about the bright areas (because we won't have saturation), and longer <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> effectively capture the dark areas.
