The setting was an acute inner London hospital trust, part of the UK's national health service. Of patients referred to a NLIU from acute wards, 80 were randomly assigned to usual care (remain in normal hospital system) and 97 to the NLIU (nursing-led care with no routine medical involvement). Patients were identified as medically stable but in need of additional nursing intervention by referring medical staff prior to full nursing assessment of suitability. Outcomes compared included functional dependence (Barthel Index), discharge destination and length of hospital stay. Inputs from nursing, paramedical and medical staff were measured. There {{was no significant difference in}} functional independence at discharge (p 0. 05). Patients undergoing usual care stayed in hospital for less time (mean difference 18 days, p< 0. 01) but the same number of patients were in hospital 90 days after recruitment (23 % NLIU, 24 % usual care p 0. 05) due to re-admissions. The model of care implemented differed considerably from that described in the literature with the NLIU having significantly fewer qualified nurses (RNs). Although the anticipated benefits of the NLIU were not demonstrated, the study does not conclude that the model should be rejected. Factors driving length of stay need to be further investigated, as does the possibility of post-discharge benefits.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} the Crown in the import substitution of munitions of warfare in England from 1558 to 1642. It will attempt to determine whether the Crown was responsible for their introduction and subsequent development, and if it was, why. The cordage, sailcloth and gunpowder industries were chosen as case studies in order to examine this issue. All three were first determined to have been import <b>substituted</b> during this <b>period.</b> While the Crown clearly thought these goods were necessary for national security, it cannot be assumed that it assisted these industries and that it did so because it was concerned that supplies coming from the continent might be difficult to procure. Important aspects to consider are first, the impact of the Crown on these native industries through its direct purchasing behaviour, and secondly, the impact on the industries of government acts and ordinances. If the Crown was interested in reducing dependence on foreign suppliers for these goods, then it would be expected that the Crown would, through purchasing behaviour and through legislation, support the domestic industries. It is argued here that when the Crown did act with the domestic industries in mind, fiscalism and personal finance were important considerations. It often appears to have done nothing at all. This is particularly true of the sailcloth industry. Cordage appears to have received its initial impetus as a result of personal financial concerns, but subsequent Crown support appears to have been fiscal. While interest in a domestic source of gunpowder seems apparent, fiscalism runs like a thread throughout all Crown interactions with the industry...|$|R

For illustrative purposes, we assume that the same shock a¤ects the state and control variables, and the magnitude of its impact is given by the known parameters a 2 and b 2, respectively. Such a system adequately represents the output from Dynare.

40|$|Pollen {{substitute}} diets are {{a valuable}} resource for maintaining strong and health honey bee colonies. Specific diets {{may be useful in}} one region or country and inadequate or economically unviable in others. We compared two artificial protein diets that had been formulated from locally-available ingredients in Brazil with bee bread and a non-protein sucrose diet. Groups of 100 newly-emerged, adult workers of Africanized honey bees in Brazil and European honey bees in the USA were confined in small cages and fed on one of four diets for seven days. The artificial diets included a high protein diet made of soy milk powder and albumin, and a lower protein level diet consisting of soy milk powder, brewer’s yeast and rice bran. The initial protein levels in newly emerged bees were approximately 18 - 21 μg/μL hemolymph. After feeding on the diets for seven days, the protein levels in the hemolymph were similar among the protein diet groups (~ 37 - 49 μg/μL after seven days), although Africanized bees acquired higher protein levels, increasing 145 and 100 % on diets D 1 and D 2, respectively, versus 83 and 60 % in the European bees. All the protein diets resulted in significantly higher levels of protein than sucrose solution alone. In the field, the two pollen substitute diets were tested during periods of low pollen availability in the field in two regions of Brazil. Food consumption, population development, colony weight, and honey production were evaluated to determine the impact of the diets on colony strength parameters. The colonies fed artificial diets had a significant improvement in all parameters, while control colonies dwindled during the dearth period. We conclude that these two artificial protein diets have good potential as pollen <b>substitutes</b> during dearth <b>periods</b> and that Africanized bees more efficiently utilize artificial protein diets than do European honey bees.

40|$|Grand fir (Abies grandis /Douglas ex D.

It was introduced to the Czech Republic, as well as to other European countries, since {{the first half of the}} 19 th century, mainly by aristocratic families. First plantings were performed in the parks, but gradually also in the forest stands. Another wave of interest in this tree species was associated with the decline of the domestic silver fir (Abies alba Mill.). It was to some extent <b>substitute,</b> for this <b>period</b> comes the greatest number of plantations in the country. The aim of this thesis is, therefore, monitoring of growth and production of the grand fir, but also the evaluation of the effects on the basic characteristics of the soil chemistry, nutrient dynamics and possible degradation effect on forest lands. Research areas were mainly located in the University Forest Enterprise Kostelec nad Černými lesy, but also in other places such as Hrubá Skála at Turnov, forests owned by Kinský at Žďár nad Sázavou and Kynšperk nad Ohří. Monitoring was carried out on already established and monitored middle-aged permanent plots (35 to 55 years), which were assessed at mensurational parameters (position, height, diameter at breast height, ratio of the green crown), in further the quantity and quality of forest floor and upper mineral soil components was studied. This work also contains the measurements of the provenance plot of Forestry and Game Management Research Institute. The results show that the grand fir is a productive tree species that exceeds the stock of domestic conifer tree species and its intensive growth is comparable with Douglas fir. From the perspective of provenance trials is crucial the correct choice of provenance, which achieves better yields and quality of wood. Best provenances come from the island Vancouver and the coast of Washington state. At the soil analysis reaching grand fir better values in comparison with Norway spruce and got it closer to the values of broad-leaved tree species. Thus it can be said that grand fir represents important soil-improving and stabilization tree species...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{existence}} of one global vegetable oil market. We analyze the historic price developments in the period 2000 {{until the end of}} 2015 of fish oil, soybean oil, groundnut oil, sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, corn oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, coconut oil and linseed oil. The existence of one market can be investigated by the means of Johansen cointegration tests. There is statistical evidence which suggests that there is a strong relationship among the oils in the long-run. The quality of the oils and which end-users the oils have, are the main factors which cause the degree of integration. The general oils (soybean, sunflower, rapeseed and palm oil) which are close substitutes in the cooking and margarine manufacturing are cointegrated over the full period. In addition, the law of one price is accepted for these oils. Tests of all ten oils as in one system rejects the law of one price, but suggests cointegration in the long-run. The lauric oils, coconut and palm kernel oil, are considered as cointegrated and forms a separate sub-market within the global vegetable oil market. Hence, the degree of market integration is strongly linked to the qualities of the oils. Fish oil has risen to become a premium oil compared to the other vegetable oils. During the commodity boom era, fish oil formed a stationary linear relationship with rapeseed oil. The observed integration between the two {{can be explained by the}} degree of substitution of fish oil by rapeseed oil as input in salmon feed – fish oil and rapeseed oil was <b>substitutes</b> in this <b>period,</b> despite fish oil’s premium qualities as a source of Omega- 3. There is a break around June 2011 which caused rapeseed oil (and the other vegetable oils) to diverge from fish oil. The high price of fish oil in the recent years is deemed as a result of high demand of fish oil in a new Omega- 3 market for human consumption. Thus, fish oil is no longer considered as integrated with the vegetable oils. The high prices of fish oil has caused the salmon feed costs to increase, as fish oil is an important input in the feed. The demand of fish oil is believed to be high in the future, both from the aquaculture industry and the Omega- 3 market. Therefore, we believe that the price of fish oil will be traded at premium compared to the vegetable oils in the future...|$|R
