25|$|The {{application}} of plasma polymers as coatings {{has also been}} studied. Plasma polymers formed from tetramethoxysilane have been studied as protective coatings and have shown to increase the hardness of polyethylene and polycarbonate. The use of plasma polymers to coat plastic lenses is increasing in popularity. Plasma depositions are able to easily coat curved materials with a good uniformity, {{such as those of}} bifocals. The different plasma polymers used can be not only <b>scratch</b> <b>resistant,</b> but also hydrophobic leading to anti-fogging effects.|$|E
25|$|Glass aquaria {{have been}} a popular choice for many home and {{hobbyist}} aquarists for many years.

Although the price {{is one of the main}} considerations for aquarists when deciding which of these two types of aquaria to purchase, for very large tanks, the price difference tends to disappear.|$|E
25|$|Glass was a {{desirable}} material for mirrors. Because {{the surface of}} glass is naturally smooth, it produces reflections with very little blur. In addition, glass is very hard and <b>scratch</b> <b>resistant.</b> However, glass by itself has little reflectivity, so people began coating it with metals to increase the reflectivity. Metal-coated glass mirrors are said by the Roman scholar Pliny the Elder to have been invented in Sidon (modern-day Lebanon) {{in the first century}} AD, although no archeological evidence of them date from before the third century. According to Pliny, the people of Sidon developed a technique for creating crude mirrors by coating blown glass with molten lead. Glass mirrors backed with gold leaf are mentioned by Pliny in his Natural History, written in about 77 AD. Because there were few ways to make a smooth piece of glass with a uniform thickness, these ancient glass-mirrors were made by blowing a glass bubble, and then cutting off a small, circular section, producing mirrors that were either concave or convex. These circular mirrors were typically small, from only a fraction of an inch to as much as eight inches in diameter. These small mirrors produced distorted images, yet were prized objects of high value. These ancient glass mirrors were very thin, thus very fragile, because the glass needed to be extremely thin to prevent cracking when coated with a hot, molten metal. Due to the poor quality, high cost, and small size of these ancient glass mirrors, solid metal-mirrors primarily of steel were usually preferred until the late nineteenth century.|$|E

50|$|Working with {{composite}} lumber {{is similar}} to working with wood. However, composite lumber has {{the added benefit of}} being less likely to split or delaminate.

Although composite lumber may resist these marring effects better than other materials, it will still show signs of wear over time. Composite lumber often has a plastic-like or synthetic appearance. Although manufacturers do mold the product with a wood grain or brush stroke pattern, some consumers simply do not like the artificial sheen.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{method for}} {{manufacturing}} diffraction gratings uses a photosensitive gel sandwiched between two substrates. [...] A holographic interference pattern exposes the gel which is later developed. [...] These gratings, called volume phase holography diffraction gratings (or VPH diffraction gratings) have no physical grooves, but instead a periodic modulation of the refractive index within the gel. [...] This removes {{much of the}} surface scattering effects typically seen in other types of gratings. [...] These gratings also tend to have higher efficiencies, and allow {{for the inclusion of}} complicated patterns into a single grating. In older versions of such gratings, environmental susceptibility was a trade-off, as the gel had to be contained at low temperature and humidity. [...] Typically, the photosensitive substances are sealed between two substrates which make them resistant to humidity, thermal and mechanical stresses. VPH diffraction gratings are not destroyed by accidental touches and are more <b>scratch</b> <b>resistant</b> than typical relief gratings.|$|E

40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{deals with the}} design of a transparent protective coating and its application on flat substrates in polycarbonate. The experimental analyses looked into the formulation of the coating material, the best strategy to deposit it as well as the characterization of the coated substrates. Visual appearance and morphological features of the coatings were studied by combined scanning electron microscope and contact gauge surface profiler. Their scratch and wear endurance were assessed by progressive and constant load scratching procedure and dry sliding linear reciprocating tribological tests. Imaging analyses were also used to evaluate the deformation response of the coating material to scratch and wear. Analytical modeling was developed accordingly, thus allowing to establish a strict relation between the design criteria of the coatings, the overall (coating + substrate) material performance and the loading conditions. The experimental findings showed the organic coatings were able to significantly improve the micro-mechanical and tribological response of the bare polycarbonate, thus making it available for a large share of applications where high performant, <b>scratch</b> and wear <b>resistant</b> materials are an ineluctable pre-requisite. © © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|A {{comparative}} {{evaluation of}} electrostatic spray and 'hot dipping' fluidized bed to deposit two different organic paints {{belonging to the}} class of thermoplastic (PPA 571, an alloy of acid modified polyolefins) and thermoset (TGIC-free transparent pigmented bronze polyester) powders was performed. Visual appearance of the investigated coatings was evaluated by colour, gloss and coating thickness measurements {{as well as by}} the determination of the surface morphologies. Micro-mechanical performance of the coatings was assessed by progressive load scratch tests. 'Hot dipping' fluidized bed is found a fast deposition technique as, after substrate pre-heating, it takes just few seconds to have the part completely powder coated. On the other hand, electrostatic spray deposition is a potentially selective coating technique, but it lasts longer (generally, 6 - 15 s) and, moreover, the coated parts must be post-cured for long time (at least, 15 min) and at high temperature (150 - 200 °C) to give rise to the formation of continuous films. Indeed, whilst 'hot dipping' fluidized bed is found particularly suitable for the deposition of thick and smooth thermoplastic coatings, electrostatic spray deposition is found the most viable technique to deposit thinner and highly <b>scratch</b> and wear <b>resistant</b> thermoset coatings. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|Applications of {{coloured}} {{thin films}} {{can be found}} on the production of high-quality consumer products, such as eyeglass frames, wristwatch casings and wristbands. These components should possess <b>scratch</b> and corrosion <b>resistant</b> surfaces through the desired lifetime. Recently, metal oxynitrides, MeNxOy (Me = early transition metal) were proposed for decorative applications. In these materials, variations on the amount of oxygen allow the film properties to be tailored, originating a wide range of colours. Additionally, these materials should also fulfil the wear and corrosion requirements above referred. In the present work the corrosion behaviour of single layered zirconium oxynitride, ZrNxOy films, immersed in artificial sweat solutions, is described. Films were produced by rf reactive magnetron sputtering at a constant substrate temperature of 300 ºC, from a pure Zr target. The main processing variable was the flow rate of reactive. The corrosion resistance was evaluated by potentiodynamic polarisation tests and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) at different immersion times, at room temperature. The corrosion resistance of the films is strongly affected by the O/N ratio. A slight tendency to improving the corrosion resistance of the films was found with the increasing in the atomic fraction of oxygen. Nevertheless, pitting was found in all samples. However, the amount of pits seems to be strongly dependent not only on the composition of the film, but also on the processing-induced defects distribution.

40|$|Melamine Formaldehyde (MF) resins are {{thermosetting}} synthetic materials. The present work {{deals with}} {{the evaluation of the}} impregnation process, modification of resin structure and abrasion resistant applications. During the industrial process paper is impregnated by aqueous oligomers. The drying procedure and the corresponding residual volatile content is a crucial step during production, because of its influence on the later surface quality. Standard measurement routines do not differentiate between physical and chemical origin. Using TGA and DSC methods, the evaporation of water could be characterized as a clear separation of solvent evaporation and the release of water during condensation. The method could be used to upgrade current quality control as well as reaction condition tuning. According to the characteristics of duroplastic material, the formed network is very dense but also brittle. Challenging applications require highly modified resins in order to decrease the network density. Substances from bio renewable resources offer chemical possibilities for covalent crosslinking. Several substance classes have been tested for compatibility via hydroxyl groups or amines. The addition of polyols under appropriate reaction conditions showed chemical incorporation into the MF prepolymer. NMR methods have been used to characterize the resins. The synthesized polymers represent a suitable alternative for the usage in challenging furniture and flooring laminate applications. MF applications for <b>scratch</b> and wear <b>resistant</b> surfaces are commonly reinforced by multiple layer setups with inorganic particles. Fulfilling normative requirements a one sheet setup of decorative paper has been developed and tested. The incorporation of special corundum particles directly on the decorative printed paper combined with a new coating system resulted in surfaces of the requested quality for wear resistance surfaces...|$|R
40|$|As surface {{engineering}} develops, {{the methods of}} applying coatings and the materials used have improved significantly. One method of coating deposition that is becoming increasingly popular is physical vapour deposition (PVD). This research investigates PVD coatings of single layered systems, dual layered systems and multilayered systems with varying layer thicknesses. The properties of the coatings are investigated along with the dependence of those properties on the coating materials, the coating architecture, the hardness and surface finish of the substrates used {{as well as the}} deposition conditions. Tests were carried out on the coatings to investigate their tribological and corrosion resistant properties compared against industry standard benchmark coatings of electrodeposited chromium and nickel respectively. The base materials chosen were as follows: CrN (hard wearing) and Graphit-iC (low friction) for the durable and low friction coatings; corrosion resistant IN 625 and chromium for the <b>scratch</b> and corrosion <b>resistant</b> coatings. The results showed that multilayering can be an effective tool for increasing the hardness and scratch resistance of a coating system; however, no benefit was seen in terms of the wear and corrosion resistance of the selected coating systems through multilayering. In terms of corrosion behaviour of the coated systems, the coatings themselves were corrosion resistant, and therefore the system behaviour depends upon the barrier properties of the PVD films. PVD coatings contain growth defects which provide a route for exposure of the substrate to the corrosive media. Irrespective of the film architecture, the substrate surface finish was seen to {{play a significant role in}} determining defect density, resulting in a lower defect density for coatings deposited on substrates with a finer surface finish, which resulted in an improvement in the corrosion barrier properties of the resulting films...|$|R
