40|$|A {{number of}} {{developments}} {{within the last}} 12 months promise to bring changes to the upper layers of the Domain Name System. In combination, these changes {{have the potential to}} radically transform the DNS root zone. DNS-OARC has, under a contract with ICANN, studied the impact of these proposed or imminent changes to the root zone. One of these changes is the increasing deployment of IPv 6 in both the root zone and the TLDs. ICANN has been offering AAAA record publication in the root zone since 2004; however, uptake has been somewhat slow. Five years later (July 2009), 169 TLDs have AAAA records while the other 111 do not. Another significant change is the advancing deployment of DNSSEC. At present, 10 full-production TLDs are signing their zones. The root zone remains unsigned, though, and DNSSEC-related records have yet to be added to it. However, parties responsible for the management of the root zone <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>expect</b> it to be signed {{by the end of this}} year...|$|E
40|$|Many have {{suggested}} we adopt policies that explicitly encourage the elderly to work. Behind this suggestion {{is the assumption}} that if an older person desires a job, one will be found; however, {{little is known about the}} extent to which this is true, and in the Health and Retirement Study, many more respondents <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>expect</b> to work after retirement than actually undertake work. This raises an important question: To what extent can the elderly readily find suitable jobs? In the context of a theoretical job search model, we examine the decision to search for a job and the probability of transitioning to employment using a large sample of non-workers from the Health and Retirement Study. The effects of both supply-side factors (individual characteristics) and demand-side factors (local labor market conditions) are estimated. We find employment transition rates are relatively low for older searchers: only half of older searchers successfully attain jobs. We examine various explanations for this result, including variation in search intensity, reservation wages, and the possibility of intervening health shocks. We conclude that about 13 % of older job searchers becomes a discouraged worker in the sense of being willing to work at the prevailing wage, but unable to find a job. ...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the discursive {{representation}} of women’s interests and needs in Makueni District, a rural area {{in the eastern part}} of Kenya. The study explores the mismatch between the way politicians and other community leaders select and represent these interests and needs and the way women construct these issues in women’s groups. It provides a fresh approach to the study of women’s issues by using a Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) as a means of uncovering the subtle ways in which the representation of these issues interfaces with questions of power. The thesis explores the overall question: how does a study of the language used to talk about women’s interests and needs help us understand the constraints and possibilities for women with regard to agency and change? Data was collected from political rallies, interviews and focus group discussions. The data for the entire study consists of four political speeches, ten interviews with politicians and other community leaders and eleven focus group discussions with women’s groups. CDA as theory and method provides a framework for understanding how prevailing discourses impact on the participation of women in the political process in Kenya. A key finding of the research is that though women, politicians and other community leaders construct women’s agency within deficit discourses, these discourses do not match women’s enacted practices or what political and community leaders <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>expect</b> of women. The contradiction that emerges from the study is that although everyone constructs women as lacking in agency, these women act as agentive subjects. All these three categories of research participants draw on prevailing discourses about women in Kenya which locate women is a discourse of negative representation. This language reflects and reproduces the exclusion of women in the political process because it is hard for women to believe that they have a contribution to make when they are interpellated by these deficit discourses. Women for example continuously demand for a leader, a mentor and a saviour; an individualized discourse yet agency and sustainability depend on the collective. Further, my research has shown that women’s groups that are the focus of this study (popularly known as merry-go-rounds in Kenya) are not ‘feminist’ groups. While the aim of feminist groups is transformation, the aim of the women’s groups is sustainability. Overall, the study shows that women’s power is located in traditional discourse and collective action is at the heart of women’s ability to sustain their existence and their communities. Women’s inaction on the other hand is located in deficit discourses, a negative discourse on women. If they were to understand and recognize the power of the collective, and that power is in the collective and not in an individual leader, they might choose to influence the political process in a different way. Such understanding might provide different possibilities for political agency and transformation. The key finding of this research is the need to change the discourse of negative representation so that women can recognize their own potential for power...|$|E

Implementing EHR systems requires an understanding of patient expectations for consent mechanisms and consideration of public awareness towards information sharing as might be made possible through integrated EHRs across primary and secondary health providers. ObjectivesTo explore levels of public awareness about EHRs and to examine attitudes towards different consent models with respect to sharing identifiable and de-identified records for healthcare provision, research and planning. MethodsA cross-sectional questionnaire survey was administered to adult patients and members of the public in primary and secondary care clinics in West London, UK in 2011. In total, 5331 individuals participated in the survey, and 3157 were included in the final analysis. ResultsThe majority (91 %) of respondents expected to be explicitly asked for consent for their identifiable records to be accessed for health provision, research or planning. Half the respondents (49 %) did not expect to be asked for consent before their de-identified records were accessed. Compared with White British respondents, those from all other ethnic groups were more likely to anticipate their permission would be obtained before their de-identified records were used. Of the study population, 59 % reported already being aware of EHRs before the survey. Older respondents and individuals with complex patterns of interaction with healthcare services were more likely to report prior awareness of EHRs. Individuals self-identifying as belonging to ethnic groups other than White British, and those with lower educational qualifications were less likely to report being aware of EHRs than White British respondents and respondents with degree-level education, respectively. Those who reported being aware of EHRs were less likely to <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>expected</b> explicit consent to be sought before use of their de-identified record. ConclusionsA large number of patients remain unaware of EHRs, while preference for implicit consent is stronger among those who report previous awareness.
