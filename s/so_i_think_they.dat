500|$|Durand {{was never}} {{informed}} of his character's arc and only learned more of Keamy's {{importance to the}} plot as he received new scripts; thus, he was thrilled when the role was expanded for his third appearance, in [...] "The Shape of Things to Come", when he kills Alex and Durand compared his excitement to that of [...] "a kid in a candy store." [...] He also stated that [...] "you really don't know what's {{going to happen in}} the next episode and you get the scripts pretty late, so it is pretty secretive and it's kind of exciting that way [...] you're really forced to get in the moment and say the words and play the guy". [...] Durand was initially met with negative reaction from fans on the street for this action and he defended his murderous character by arguing that it was actually more Ben's fault for failing to negotiate with Keamy; later, fans warmed up to Keamy. [...] Despite the antagonist's increasing popularity and fanbase, it became apparent to Durand that fans were hoping for Keamy's death in what promised to be a showdown in the season finale. [...] Throughout his nine-episode run, Keamy never receives an episode in which his backstory is developed through flashbacks and Durand holds this partially responsible for the negative reaction to his character, saying that the audience [...] " [...] really seen anything outside of Keamy's mission, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> definitely want him put down." [...] Following the season's conclusion, Durand stated that he would not be surprised if his character returned in the fifth season and concluding that [...] "Lost was really fun. [...] If I can have that experience in any genre, I'd take it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{concerns}} to the contrary, Glasberg denied that Ziva [...] "friend zoned" [...] Tony in the finale. He explained, [...] "It might not satisfy everyone out there, but I think we're getting there — she even reaches {{up with her}} hand and puts it very gently, and in a lovely way, on his shoulder before that kiss happens. I think there are gestures being made that have definitely advanced from where we were a year ago." [...] In response to complaints about {{the pace of the}} development, he said, [...] "There are a lot of fans {{who would like to see}} that story advance much faster than we're doing it, but I firmly believe a little goes a long way and there are ways to tease it and to flirt that are just as significant and just as meaningful." [...] He maintained, [...] "We made huge strides. Their relationship has evolved, has changed. They're a little more open with each other and a little more emotionally connected, certainly more than where we were at the beginning of the season. [...] may not be the big leap that a lot of people would like it to be, but I also feel like we're enjoying the pace at which this is happening. That's not to say we're not headed in the direction everyone would like to go, but I think we’re getting there. It's very complicated when two agents who are working together get into a relationship, and that's something that [...] would be very conscious of. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> would tread lightly, which is why, in theory, we're treading lightly and being very careful about the steps that we take." ...|$|E

2500|$|Earlier, Goodell had {{indicated}} {{that he was going}} to come down hard on the players involved, telling Eisen that they [...] "enthusiastically embraced" [...] the scheme. [...] "They are on the field, <b>so</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> are absolved from any responsibility because of that," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "The ape-men," [...] he cried. [...] "My God, what brutes! Don't {{raise your}} voice, for {{they have long}} ears--sharp eyes, too, but no power of scent, <b>so</b> far as <b>I</b> could judge, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> can sniff us out. Where have you been, young fellah? You were well out of it." ...|$|R

6000|$|Colonel Woodburn frowned a little, {{and passed}} over the joke. [...] "I think Mr. Lindau is right. Such {{exhibitions}} were common to both sides, though if you gentlemen will pardon me for saying <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> were less frequent on ours. We were fighting more immediately for existence. We were fewer than you were, and we knew it; we felt more intensely that if each were not for all, then none was for any." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What upon airth keeps those {{children}} <b>so</b> long? <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>they</b> were making chips!" [...] said Aunt Mehetabel; [...] "the fire's just a going {{out under the}} tea kettle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope <b>so,</b> sir. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> {{will be able}} {{to cross}} in our face, and it will do the men a lot of good to win the first fight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I went, {{who wished}} to learn all that I could of the building. They led me into a little chamber cut in the {{thickness}} of the stone-work, in the wall of which are slits like loop-holes for the shooting of arrows, wide within, but very narrow without, <b>so</b> that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> cannot be seen from below, hidden as they are between the rough stones of the tower.|$|R
6000|$|... "As to revenue," [...] said Rectus, {{just before}} we reached the hotel, [...] "I don't believe these people have much money to give {{for the support of}} a queen, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> ought to bring in provisions. The whole thing might be portioned out. She ought to have so many conchs a week, so many sticks of sugar-cane, and so many yams and other stuff. This might be fixed so that it wouldn't come hard on anybody." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} that I spoke so to you, Ralph, that awful day," [...] she said. [...] "For hours {{together}} I have thought over all that happened, {{and though it}} was hard to overcome a feeling of resentment against the others, and even you at first, I tried to judge them fairly; and, if it is not disloyal to say <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> were right. Some day, when there will be many things to settle, I hope to tell them so; but I cannot do it yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Waal," [...] Jerry said wrathfully, [...] "onless {{they catch}} Harry asleep, {{some of the}} darned skunks will be rubbed out afore they get his scalp. It is a good country for hiding trail. There are many streams {{coming down from the}} hills into the Big Wind, and they can turn up or down any of them as they please, and land on rocky ground too, so it would be no easy matter to track them. By the lay of the country there does not seem much chance of gold anywheres about here, and, as I reckon, they will be {{thinking}} more of that than of beaver skins, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> would push straight on." ...|$|E
25|$|We {{answered}} the charges <b>so</b> superabundantly that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> affected {{very few of}} our givers....Of course, they made a difference with some who had no inclination {{to look into the}} matter. On the other hand, they helped us financially.|$|R
5000|$|... "And if {{you look}} at the time frame for these three books--William Carlos Williams, Man Ray, Thomas Edison--they all begin sort of in the last vestiges of the {{industrial}} era and the romantic era in culture and they pass through the cataclysm of the wars and they end up sort of on the threshold of--of our day. And <b>so</b> <b>I</b> do <b>think</b> <b>they</b> all connect, even though on first blush it is--it's hard to see the connection, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> there is a connection." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The March winds blow {{everywhere}} in this wretched island, Madame Goesler, {{and there is}} no escaping them. Youth may prevail against them; but on me they are <b>so</b> potent that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> will succeed in driving me out of my country. I doubt whether an old man should ever live in England if he can help it." ...|$|R
60|$|Lastly: Since {{the world}} abounds with pestilent books {{particularly}} against this {{doctrine of the}} Trinity; it is fit to inform you, that the authors of them proceed wholly upon a mistake: They would shew how impossible it is that three can be one, and one can be three; whereas the Scripture saith no such thing, at least in that manner they would make it: but, only, {{that there is some}} kind of unity and distinction in the divine nature, which mankind cannot possibly comprehend: thus, the whole doctrine is short and plain, and in itself incapable of any controversy: since God himself hath pronounced the fact, but wholly concealed the manner. And therefore many divines, who thought fit to answer those wicked books, have been mistaken too, by answering fools in their folly; and endeavouring to explain a mystery, which God intended to keep secret from us. And, as I would exhort all men to avoid reading those wicked books written against this doctrine, as dangerous and pernicious; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> may omit the answers, as unnecessary. This I confess will probably affect but few or none among the generality of our congregations, who do not much trouble themselves with books, at least of this kind. However, many who do not read themselves, are seduced by others that do; and thus become unbelievers upon trust and at second-hand; and this is too frequent a case: for which reason I have endeavoured to put this doctrine upon a short and sure foot, levelled to the meanest understanding; by which we may, as the apostle directs, be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh us a reason of the hope that is in us, with meekness and fear.|$|E
6000|$|It {{seems to}} me that the South has two objects in view: firstly the [...] liberation of its trade and people from the law of tribute to the [...] North; {{secondly}} and perhaps mainly, the maintenance of the slave [...] system without fear or risk of Northern interference. That on the [...] other hand it is very difficult to analyse that movement of the [...] North which Mrs. Stowe finds sublime, but which in my eyes is [...] tumultuous. There is the anti-slavery motive impelling with great [...] vehemence a small section, which she rather offensively calls the [...] Christian people of the union; there is the spirit of protection [...] and monopoly, unwilling to surrender future booty; there is the [...] unquietness in the great towns, found in America as in all [...] countries, and ever ready for a row; there is the fear which Mr. [...] Motley described, that unless a firm front were shown against [...] secession it would not stop where it had begun; there is last and [...] (relatively to this subject matter) best of all the strong [...] instinct of national life, and the abhorrence of nature itself [...] towards all severance of an organised body. This last sentiment, [...] as well as the first, deserved to be treated by us with great [...] tenderness and respect.... As to the authority and title of the [...] North it must be granted primâ facie, but on examination it is [...] subject to a good deal of doubt, and I think it seems to have been [...] the intention of the framers of the constitution not to lay down a [...] rule for the solution of a great question of this kind, but to [...] leave it open. And if <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> were wise; for such a [...] question could only arise for any practical purpose at a time when [...] the foundations of the great social deep are broken up, and when [...] the forces brought into unrestrained play are by far too gigantic [...] to be controlled by paper conventions.|$|E
6000|$|... "So I did, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> would. I've {{only heard}} some o' them say they don't like white men so well as black; {{but if they}} was hungry they wouldn't be particular. Anyhow, I'm sure they would kill you. You see, Ralph, I've been a good while in them parts, and I've visited the {{different}} groups of islands oftentimes as a trader. And thorough-goin' blackguards some o' them traders are--no better than pirates, I can tell you. One captain that I sailed with was not a chip better than the one we're with now. He was trading with a friendly chief one day aboard his vessel. The chief had swam off to us with the things for trade tied atop of his head, for them chaps are like otters in the water. Well, the chief was hard on the captain, and would not part with some o' his things. When their bargainin' was over they shook hands, and the chief jumped overboard to swim ashore; but before he got forty yards from the ship, the captain seized a musket and shot him dead. He then hove up anchor and put to sea, and as we sailed along the shore he dropped six black fellows with his rifle, remarkin' that `that would spoil the trade for the next-comers.' But, as I was sayin', I'm up to the ways o' these fellows. One o' the laws o' the country is that every shipwrecked person {{who happens to be}} cast ashore, be he dead or alive, is doomed to be roasted and eaten. There was a small tradin' schooner wrecked off one of these islands when we were lyin' there in harbour during a storm. The crew was lost--all but three men, who swam ashore. The moment they landed, they were seized by the natives and carried up into the woods. We knew pretty well what their fate would be; but we could not help them, for our crew was small, and if we had gone ashore they would likely have killed us all. We never saw the three men again. But we heard frightful yelling and dancing and merrymaking that night; and one of the natives, who came aboard to trade with us next day, told us that the long pigs, as he called the men, had been roasted and eaten, and their bones were to be converted into sail-needles. He also said that white men were bad to eat, and that most o' the people on shore were sick." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She likes them. Lady Susan was a {{great help}} to her in London, and she feels the comfort of their honesty. They brought her to church with them one or two mornings, but it knocked her up to walk <b>so</b> early. Insensibly, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> do Lady Tyrrell's work in {{shutting}} her up from any of us." ...|$|R
500|$|On how Wilkes {{connects to}} Carter, Austin said Wilkes is [...] "one {{of the top}} {{scientists}} in his field , but he’s {{had to work hard}} to get there. It’s sort of a similar struggle of an African-American and a woman in the 1940s to try to succeed, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> both see that in one another and that’s part of where the chemistry and connection comes from." [...] Expanding on the love triangle that forms between Wilkes, Sousa, and Carter, Austin said, [...] "we’re very nice to each other. We’re professional. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that Sousa likes Wilkes enough and it’s the same the other way".|$|R
60|$|But {{there was}} no choice. Their master, Robertson, ordered them to come and after {{a glance at the}} Zulus they {{concluded}} that the command was one which would be enforced and that if they stopped behind, it would not be as living men. Also some of them had lost wives or children in the slaughter, which, if they were not very brave, filled them with a desire for revenge. Lastly, they could all shoot after a fashion and had good rifles; moreover if <b>I</b> may say <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> put confidence in my leadership. So they made the best of a bad business and got themselves ready.|$|R
60|$|This attempt, however, at {{guessing}} {{what may}} be the probable amount of the debt {{at the close of the}} war is absolutely futile. No one can as yet conjecture when the war may be over, or what collateral expenses may attend its close. It may be the case that the government, in fixing some boundary between the future United States and the future Southern Confederacy, will be called on to advance a very large sum of money as compensation for slaves who shall have been liberated in the border States, or have been swept down South into the cotton regions with the retreating hordes of the Southern army. The total of the bill cannot be reckoned up while the work is still unfinished. But, after all, that question as to the amount of the bill is not to us the question of the greatest interest. Whether the debt shall amount to two, or three, or even to four hundred millions sterling; whether it remain fixed at its present modest dimensions, or swell itself out to the magnificent proportions of our British debt; will the resources of the country enable it to bear such a burden? Will it be found that the Americans share with us that elastic power of endurance which has enabled us to bear a weight that would have ruined any other people of the same number? Have they the thews and muscles, the energy and endurance, the power of carrying which we possess? They have got our blood in their veins, and have these qualities gone with the blood? It is of little avail either to us or to the truth that we can show some difference between our position and their position which may seem to be in our favor. They doubtless could show other points of difference on the other side. With us, in the early years of this century, it was a contest for life and death, in which we could not stop to count the cost--in which we believed that we were fighting for all that we cared to call our own, and in which we were resolved that we would not be beaten as long as we had a man to fight and a guinea to spend. Fighting in this mind we won. Had we fought in any other mind I think I may say that we should not have won. To the Americans of the Northern States this also is a contest for life and death. I will not here stay to argue whether this need have been <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> are right; but this at least must be accorded to them--that, having gone into this matter of civil war, it behoves them to finish it with credit to themselves. There are many Englishmen who think that we were wrong to undertake the French war; but there is, I take it, no Englishman who thinks that we ought to have allowed ourselves to be beaten when we had undertaken it. To the Americans it is now a contest of life and death. They also cannot stop to count the cost, They also will go on as long as they have a dollar to spend or a man to fight.|$|E
50|$|It's {{hard to say}} definitively, {{because we}} don't own the {{copyright}} for it. The producers could make 10 more if they wanted to.

They've been making one a year every year for the past seven years, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> need some time off.|$|E
5000|$|Following the {{addition}} of Jimmy Carlin, a former rider for Jamie Thomas's Mystery brand, on September 3, 2013, Hsu announced his departure from the company. Hsu explained {{in an interview that}} was published on October 12, 2013 that his decision was spurred by the departure of longtime brand manager Matt Eversole who, according to Hsu, grew tired of protecting the brand from the profit-driven demands of shareholders. Barletta will take Eversole's place as Enjoi's brand manager and Hsu stated: [...] "Louie understands what Enjoi is all about, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> can still make something really great and I wish them the best." ...|$|E

Albini later observed the use of studio banter on Surfer Rosa: [...] "It's on their record forever <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> now <b>they</b> are obliged to say that they're ok with it, but I honestly don't know that that idea would've ever come up if I hadn't done it. There are times when things like that are revealing and entertaining and I kind of felt it was a bit gimmicky on this record." ...|$|R
5000|$|It's {{partly a}} {{question}} of point-of-view. The book is entirely {{in the voice of}} the 14-year-old girl. That sort of tips the feeling of it over a certain way. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> book is much funnier than the movie was <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> unfortunately, <b>they</b> lost a lot of humor in both the situations and in her voice. It also ends differently than the movie did. You see the main character - the little girl - 25 years later when she's an adult. Another way in which it's a little bit different from the movie - and maybe this is just because of the time the movie was made - is that it's a lot tougher and more violent than the movie reflects. Which is part of what's interesting about it.|$|R
50|$|Beiimaan Love {{released}} on 14 October 2016. The film was not promoted by Sunny {{and her husband}} Daniel Weber and Chaudhari claims {{that it was because}} he refused to chop off her intimate scenes in the film. “The duo is going through a psychological fear and box-office phobia. Sunny’s previous outings have not fared well. After seeing the rough cut, they wanted me to chop off intimate scenes between the actress and Rajneesh. Daniel claimed that he had contributed his bit by revamping Sunny’s films on the editing table.
