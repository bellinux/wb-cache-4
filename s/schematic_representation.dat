5|$|The seductive details {{effect has}} {{primarily}} been demonstrated {{at the point}} of knowledge acquisition (initial learning); its impact on transfer performance has not been clearly shown. Theory in text comprehension suggests that seductive details might be detrimental for recall but advantageous for transfer performance because of the <b>schematic</b> <b>representation</b> of information that trainees form during instruction. Researchers have described the seductive details effect as having a damaging effect on recall because it distracts trainees from learning and they tend to form inappropriate schemas to organize information. However, when learners are applying knowledge, empirical studies suggest that the distortion of the macro structure or schema of the instructional material is beneficial.|$|E

[...] It originates in a passage in the biblical Book of Isaiah which describes metaphorically the descent of the Messiah, and is accepted by Christians as referring to Jesus. [...] The various figures depicted in the lineage of Jesus are drawn from those names listed in the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke.|$|E
2500|$|The diagram shows a <b>schematic</b> <b>representation</b> of an NPN {{transistor}} {{connected to}} two voltage sources. ( [...] The same description applies to a PNP transistor with reversed directions of current flow and applied voltage.) [...] To make the transistor conduct appreciable current (on {{the order of}} 1mA) from C to E, VBE must be above a minimum value {{sometimes referred to as}} the cut-in voltage. The cut-in voltage is usually about 650mV for silicon BJTs at room temperature but can be different {{depending on the type of}} transistor and its biasing. This applied voltage causes the lower P-N junction to 'turn on', allowing a flow of electrons from the emitter into the base. In active mode, the electric field existing between base and collector (caused by VCE) will cause the majority of these electrons to cross the upper P-N junction into the collector to form the collector current IC. The remainder of the electrons recombine with holes, the majority carriers in the base, making a current through the base connection to form the base current, IB. As shown in the diagram, the emitter current, IE, is the total transistor current, which is the sum of the other terminal currents, (i.e., IE=IB+IC).|$|E

40|$|International audienceRepresenting spatio-temporal events using {{pictures}} or <b>schematic</b> <b>representations</b> {{is a difficult}} challenge, since static representations are meant to convey dynamic processes. A {{case in point is}} the representation of battles, for which historians have devised schematic maps using various conventions. More recently, in the field of geography, the language of choremes has been introduced for the representation of geographical change. This paper describes work in progress on the automatic pictorial representation of events extracted from natural language texts. The general purpose of the research consists in generating schematic visual pictures of spatio-temporal processes described in natural language texts. The application currently under development generates <b>schematic</b> <b>representations,</b> based on choremes, of the events described in a short excerpt from Caesar's " Gallic War " as a testbed...|$|R

40|$|Although visual-spatial {{representations}} {{are used}} extensively {{in mathematics and}} spatial ability is highly correlated with success in mathematics education, research to date has not demonstrated a clear relationship between use of visual-spatial representations and success in mathematical problem solving. The authors distinguished 2 types of visual-spatial representations: <b>schematic</b> <b>representations</b> that encode the spatial relations described in a problem and pictorial representations that encode the visual appearance of the objects described in the problem. Participants solved mathematical problems and reported on their solution strategies. The authors were able to reliably classify their visual-spatial <b>representations</b> as primarily <b>schematic</b> or primarily pictorial. Use of <b>schematic</b> spatial <b>representations</b> was associated with success in mathematical problem solving, whereas use of pictorial representations was negatively correlated with success. Use of <b>schematic</b> <b>representations</b> was also significantly correlated with one measure of spatial ability. The research therefore helps clarify the relationship between visual imagery, spatial ability, and mathematical problem solving. Visual imagery refers {{to the ability to}} form mental representations of the appearance of objects and to manipulat...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} has challenged classic theories of hippocampal function in spatial memory with findings that the hippocampus {{may be necessary}} for detailed representations of environments learned long ago, but not for remembering the gist or schematic aspects that are sufficient for navigating within those environments (Rosenbaum et al., 2000). We aimed to further probe distinctions between detailed and <b>schematic</b> <b>representations</b> of familiar environments with three hippocampal amnesic patients by testing them on a route description task and mental navigation tasks that assess the identity and location of landmarks, and distances and directions between them. The amnesic cases could describe basic directions along known, imagined routes, estimate distance and direction between well-known landmarks, and produce sketch maps with accurate layouts, suggestive of intact <b>schematic</b> <b>representations.</b> However, findings that patientsâ€™ route descriptions lack richness of detail, along with impoverished sketch maps and poor landmark recognition, substantiates previous findings that detailed representations are hippocampus-dependent...|$|R

40|$|To {{what extent}} are <b>schematic</b> <b>representations</b> neurally {{distinguished}} from language {{on the one}} hand, and from rich perceptual representations on the other? In a group lesion study, matching tasks depicting categorical spatial relations were used to probe for the comprehension of basic spatial concepts across distinct representational formats (words, pictures, schemas). Focused residual analyses using voxelbased lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) suggest that left hemisphere deficits in categorical spatial representation are difficult to distinguish from deficits in naming such relations, and that the right hemisphere plays a special role in extracting <b>schematic</b> <b>representations</b> from richly textured pictures. EE 555, a patient with simultagnosia, performed six similar matching tasks. On the only two tasks that did not include matching to, or from, schemas, EE 555 performed at chance levels. EE 555 was significantly better on schema tasks, indicating that abstract analog representations make spatial relations visible {{in a manner that}} symbols and complex images do not...|$|R

Moreover, each window contains buttons which are activated with the mouse and allow different kinds of function, all created by the authors to be displayed. In particular, navigation buttons allow the users to move in the program either sequentially or non-linearly, according to their needs. The possibility of obtaining information and <b>schematic</b> <b>representations</b> is given by specific buttons. There are also multiple buttons hidden in the images which, when activated, allow the name of the selected organ to be displayed. In conclusion, this program can be especially helpful since it allows different data sets to be integrated to provide the user with complete information. Moreover, the program allows learning to be controlled, that is the user to be informed on timing and methods for more effective studying...|$|R
