50|$|Prismacolor pastels are {{available}} in several different styles. Hard, <b>soft,</b> <b>oil,</b> and pencil pastels which each offer different textures and styles {{to a piece of}} art. Pastels are made into sticks for easy handling. The sticks are pure pigment with very few fillers to help support the structure and lay of color. There are two qualities to pastels: Artist and Student. Artist quality pastels have a higher ratio of pigment giving more intense color. Student pastels contain more fillers and byproduct to help the stick keep shape and allow the pastel to withstand pressure and crumbling. With artist pastels, the richer pigments and lack of binder cause the product to be more fragile yet costly. Hard pastels are made the same way as a soft pastel but contain more binder and less pigment. Hard pastels are more stable in different drawing techniques and come in both artist and student quality. Pastel pencils are for fine details and control. The shape and size of a pastel pencils resemble colored pencils and are suitable for outdoors work. The makeup of oil pastels is pigment coated in wax or oil giving lines and shading a crayon like texture. Oil pastels are more stable than a soft pastel and do not require a fixative to work. Unlike the other types of pastels, oil based pastels will not smudge, crumble or give off dust when working on paper. Although oil pastels lack the ability to blend into other colors, the pigments can be spread on a canvas like oil paints and {{are available}} in both student and artist quality.|$|E

All of which was a nightmare bred in full day and folly to boot; but it was the fault of the Genius of the Place, who made the Englishman feel that he had done a great wrong in trespassing into the very heart and soul of all Chitor. And, behind him, the Gau-Mukh guggled and choked like a man in his death-throe. The Englishman endured as long as he could--about two minutes. Then it came upon him that he must go quickly out of this place of years and blood--must get back to the afternoon sunshine, and Gerowlia, and the dak-bungalow with the French bedstead. He desired no archæological information, he wished to take no notes, and, above all, he did not care to look behind him, where stood the reminder that he was no better than the beasts that perish.

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{macroeconomic}} and financial effects of oil prices shocks in the euro area since its creation in 1999, with a special focus on the recent slump. The analysis is carried out episode by episode, within a time-varying parameter framework, consistent with the view that "not all the oil price shocks are alike", yet without imposing any a priori identification assumption. We find evidence of recessionary effects triggered not only by oil price hikes, but also by oil price slumps in some cases, likewise for the most recent episode, which is also rising deflation risk and financial distress. In addition through uncertainty effects, the current slump might then be depressing aggregate demand by increasing the real interest rate, as ECB monetary policy is already conducted at the zero lower bound. The increase in real money balances following the slump points to the accommodation of the shock by the ECB, concurrent {{with the implementation of}} the Quantitative Easing policy (Q. E.). Yet, in so far as Q. E failed to generate inflationary expectations within the current and expected environment of <b>soft</b> <b>oil</b> prices, the case for a more expansionary use of fiscal policy than in the past would become compelling, in order to counteract the deflationary and recessionary threats to the euro area...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} common {{production}} problems in oil and gas fields is scale deposition within oil and gas wellbores. Scale formation in surface and subsurface oil and gas production equipment has been recognised to be a major operational problem. The effect of scale formation is a reduction in the well productivity and the damage to safety valves and gas-lift mandrels. This investigation proposes a new and novel technique to address the problem and lay the foundations for a methodology for descaling in-situ production tubing. This problem currently requires either aggressive chemicals or extraction and replacement tubing both of which are very expensive. The overall aim of this investigation is to study the fundamentals of the decaling process using flat fan sprays at high water pressure (< 6 MPa) and high impact force (< 0. 657 MPa). The spray was characterised quantitatively and qualitatively under ambient conditions utilising single flat fan atomiser or a combination of two or three atomisers with an overlapping configurations. The volume (or mass) flux (VLf) was measured using a patternator which was designed during this investigation. Liquid volume (or mass) flux was found to be symmetrical at different downstream distances (25, 50 and 75 mm). Impact force (IF) was also experimentally measured at different downstream distances (25, 50 and 75 mm) and at various water supply pressure of 3. 7, 4. 8 and 6 MPa for the corresponding sprays. The result showed that impact force can lie between 0. 146 to 0. 657 MPa Sprays were also characterised using Phase-Doppler Anemometry (PDA). The range of velocity (U) was found to be between 62. 48 to 81. 85 m/s at 25 mm downstream distance whilst at 50 mm downstream, it was in the range of 55. 96 to 73. 13 m/s and at 75 mm was between 48. 89 to 66. 98 m/s. However, the Sauter mean drop size diameter (D^ at 25 downstream distances was found to be in the range of 62. 45 um to 75. 80 urn and at 50 mm downstream the drop size was between 67. 30 jam to 81. 43 urn whereas at 75 mm it was 73. 56 um to 86. 42 um. Also, from the results, the liquid volume flux (ULf) obtained using PDA was measured to be between 0. 063 and 1. 2 (cm 3 /s) /cm 2 at 25 mm downstream and 0. 016 to 0. 250 (cm 3 /s) /cm 2 at 50 mm and 0. 010 to 0. 120 (cm 3 /s) /cm 2 at 75 mm downstream distance. Comparing these results with those found via patternator mesurements showed in some instanous, that there is significant (i. e up to 90 %) difference between each values which were obtained by the PDA, measured at the centre of the sprays. This was mainley to lack of caputuring the certain drop sizes by PDA and also the design geometry of the patternator together with the nature of flat shape of the spray being not truly flat. Simulated laboratory scale removal rig was subsequently designed and built to demonstrate the effects of using overlapping flat sprays atomisers to remove scales that normally found in oil and gas. Four scale samples (candle wax, <b>soft</b> <b>oil</b> wax, soft gas and oil hard) were tested. The quantity of scale removed using soft candle wax was (53 cm 3) at 30 degree atomiser angle to the vertical axis. The scales samples which were obtained from both oil and gas fields were also tested as follows: - a total of 11. 688 cm 3 of soft scale was removed using three high pressure and high impact atomisers whilst the volume of the scale removed from the oil wax was within 13. 750 cm 3 for the hard oil scale was found to be approximately 0. 989 cm 3. The structures of the flat sprays were also mathematically analysed using the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) package which allowed validating the PDA data. The velocity of the drops compared well with those obtained from PDA. The liquid volume flux, however, was found, generally, between 26 % < ULf < 90 % compared with those of PDA data.

The proposed method of gravel placement behind a non-perforated liner, which is later perforated {open_quotes}in situ{close_quotes} with a new tool operated by coiled-tubing, is expected to greatly reduce costs resulting from sand production in horizontal wells operated under cyclic steam injection. The detailed configuration of the prototype tool is described. It includes two pairs of cutting wheels at the ends of spring-loaded pivoting arms, which are periodically pressed through the liner wall and shortly thereafter retracted, while the coiled tubing is being pulled-out. For each operating cycle of the hydraulically-operated tool, this results in a set of four narrow slots parallel to the liner axis, in two perpendicular diametral planes. The shape of the edges of each slot facilitates bridging by the gravel particles, for a more effective and compacted gravel-packing. The tool includes a few easily-assembled parts machined from surface-hardened alloy steel presenting great toughness, selected from those used in die making.

40|$|In {{recent years}} an {{increased}} use of polymers has occurred to modify asphalt binders, mainly to decrease pavement rutting but also to improve binder failure strain in direct tension. Whereas all of these effects positively impact the durability of polymermodified pavements, a need exists to quantify these improvements and the duration {{in the presence of}} oxidative aging. This research evaluated the durability of polymer modified asphalt (PMA) through a number of determinations that included the characterization of the original binder property and pavement-aged binder for modified and unmodified binders. Changes in styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) polymer modified binder properties from oxidation were analyzed using dynamic shear rheometry, ductility, and force ductility. Previous literature reports using size exclusion chromatography showed that degradation of the molecular weight profile of SBS accompanied the loss of PMA ductility. Yet base binder embrittlement also occurred, as evidenced by ductility and force ductility. Testing aged PMA binders at higher temperatures to soften the base binder restored the polymer modulus to the force ductility measurements as did blending with a <b>softer</b> deasphalted <b>oil.</b> These measurements indicate that the more significant cause of PMA degradation with aging is base binder embrittlement rather than polymer degradation. Sixteen pavements in 11 Texas Districts, plus four MnRoad pavements were evaluated in order to obtain a more detailed profile of binder oxidation in pavements. Slices of each core provided detail on binder oxidation and air voids. The data confirm that binders can oxidize at least several inches into the pavement. However, oxidation also can be significantly slowed, apparently by very low accessible air voids. Interestingly, the data indicate that the air voids that are relevant to the binder at a specific depth of the pavement are those in the immediate vicinity of the binder; low air voids above or below the binder do not seem to significantly affect the binder oxidation rate. Furthermore, that binders oxidize inches below the surface shows that temperature conducts well into the pavement, consistent with a heat conduction model that is used to calculate ground temperatures as a function of depth...|$|R

Norfolk adult female rabbits – approximately 13 months of age with a mean body weight of 4. 5 kg – are used. In both radial diaphyses, 1 cm osteoperiosteal segmental defects are created. The defect in the left radius is filled with the castor-oil-based polyurethane, and the right one, filled with cancellous bone autograft, collected from the left proximal humerus. The rabbits are euthanazed at 15, 30, 60, and 120 days postsurgery (5 animals/ period), for histological analyses. By radiographic analyses, at these time points, the bone regeneration is more evident and accelerated in the bone defects treated with the cancellous bone autograft. At 120 days postsurgery, the segmental bone defects treated with the cancellous bone autograft are totally reconstituted and remodeled, while the bone defects treated with polyurethane polymer have bone formation of 79 %. Histological study shows that the polyurethane acts as a space filler, minimizing the local production of fibrous tissue. No granule degradation, resorption or any inflammatory reaction is detected. Thus, it is possible to conclude that the castor-oil-plant-based polyurethane – in the granule presentation – is biocompatible and osteointegrated, but does not show the same bone regeneration capacity as the cancellous bone autograft...|$|R

Beach litter from different maritime States and the UTs showed that Odisha coast has the lowest (0. 31 g/m 2) quantity and Goa coast (205. 75 g/m 2) the highest quantity of beach debris. Archipelagic coasts of Andamans as well as Lakshadweep recorded values higher than Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and West Bengal. Samples of debris collected from beaches revealed that all the items were domestic and anthropogenic discards. Plastic litters such as single use carry bags and sachets of <b>soft</b> drinks, edible <b>oils,</b> detergents, beverages, cases of cosmetics, toothpaste, PET bottles, ice cream containers etc., recorded highest mean of 25. 47 g/m 2 from Goa coast and the lowest (0. 08 g/m 2) from Odisha. The relative percentage of mean values of plastic (B group) items in beach debris along the Indian coast registered highest mean percentage from Maharashtra (81...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of plastic}} {{polymers}} in the pharmaceutical packaging, has grown considerably {{during the last}} two decades. Amongst the commonly used plastics, the use or polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is gaining popularity in the industrialized countries for packaging of <b>soft</b> drinks, edible <b>oils,</b> alcoholic beverages and mineral water. The present study involves the evaluation of the utilization of PET bottles. for use as pharmaceutical containers for antacid formulations. The stability study was conducted by keeping amber-coloured PET bottles containing two commercially available antacid formulations, Dijex MP and Filmacid Forte Gel, in refrigerator and at room temperature, 37 Â°C, 45 Â°C and 80 oC. Various parameters were examined, as a function of time. The study revealed that initially viscosity and pH decreased slightly and then remained unchanged. There was no effect on the concentration of Al (OH 3) and Mg (OH) 2 but a decrease in the concentration of simethicone was observed. Other tests such as OTC test, ANC test and CO 2 determination also remained within the offical limit. However, simethicone lost its defoaming activity at 45 Â°C after six months and significant flavour loss was observed at elevated temperatures (37 Â°C and 45 Â°C). Qualitative GC analysis revealed leaching of various migrants from the containerâ€™s wall into the formulation, one of which has been identified as terephthalic acid...|$|R
