60|$|The maiden went upstairs, {{and when}} she had made the bed, <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
60|$|Trembling {{with terror}} and loving pity, <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down,</b> {{and began to}} pray afresh for that poor wild mother.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down,</b> and Hereward, {{in spite}} of himself, gently bound her hands and feet, kissing them as he bound them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! I ain't done no work, have I?" [...] snapped <b>she,</b> <b>laying</b> <b>down</b> the {{stocking}} and leveling {{a needle}} at him, and putting a frightful emphasis on [...] "I." ...|$|R
5000|$|Isifile {{is waiting}} for Orestes to return. She is in such grief that <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> <b>down</b> to rest. Alinda (a Lady) then sings a cheerful aria [...] "Per provo so" [...] {{on the subject of}} finding new love as a cure for pain.|$|R
50|$|Lois seeks {{refuge in}} the {{abandoned}} barn just as a storm hits the island. <b>She</b> <b>lays</b> <b>down</b> {{in one of the}} stalls and falls asleep, but when she wakes up, she discovers that the dogs have returned. The dogs growl menacingly before they attack Lois and kill her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] she said, in weary acquiescence, as <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> again, {{just enough}} {{refreshed}} by the coffee to become sleepy.|$|E
6000|$|... 25. Then <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> in the street, Right {{before the}} horses' feet, Expecting, {{with a patient}} eye, [...] 100 Murder, Fraud, and Anarchy.|$|E
60|$|With that <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> {{in the bed}} by his side, and her misery was {{so extreme}} that she fell in a deep slumber instantly.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lay</b> flat <b>down</b> {{upon the}} grass and was silent for several minutes. Then she whispered to Jeanne.|$|R
5000|$|In 2014, a Sunday Mail {{reporter}} did {{not think}} things would work out with John and Marilyn, commenting [...] "the course of poor Marilyn's love life has never run smooth. As she prepares {{to move in with}} John, it doesn't appear this relationship will either, as <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> <b>down</b> a series of daunting laws to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] <b>she</b> answered, <b>laying</b> <b>down</b> her work, {{which she}} had been {{carrying}} on with a languid semi-consciousness, most unlike her usual self.|$|R
60|$|In {{this way}} Tina wore out {{the long hours}} of the windy moon-light, till at last, with weary aching limbs, <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> in bed again, and slept from mere exhaustion.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> in her cosey crib {{with the}} pink cover and the lace curtains, and fell fast asleep, {{glad to have}} clean sheets, soft blankets, and her own little pillow once more.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Haldin, {{she told}} me, had not shed a tear. She {{was sitting up}} in bed, and her immobility, her silence, were very alarming. At last <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> gently and had motioned her {{daughter}} away.|$|E
5000|$|Melissa Maerz {{wrote in}} Spin, [...] "fans of '70s AM Gold will sip this stuff down {{like so much}} well-aged chardonnay. Buffeted by Ward's pillowy {{acoustic}} strums, Deschanel is a convincing soft-rock goddess, conjuring Linda Ronstadt on the country shuffle 'Thieves' and Skeeter Davis on a cover of 'Gonna Get Along Without Ya Now'. <b>She</b> <b>lays</b> <b>down</b> the lullaby 'If You Can't Sleep' with a voice as clear and rosy as stained glass." ...|$|R
50|$|With Joel's {{help and}} Jay's spiritual {{guidance}} from beyond, Denise {{is able to}} put the pieces of her life together to create what will become the platinum-selling work Grace of My Heart. As <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> <b>down</b> the piano track for the song, her life is recounted in pictures; leading to the moment when her own mother receives a copy of her album in the mail with a handwritten note. Seemingly proud of her daughter's success, she smiles. Denise finally finds her fit after all.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear Mr. Floyd," [...] she wrote.--"Did I {{forget about}} the cheese?" [...] <b>she</b> wondered, <b>laying</b> <b>down</b> her pen. No, she had told Rebecca that the cheese was in the hall. [...] "I am much surprised..." [...] she wrote.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll prob'ly {{get lots}} of rest tomorrow, when I become an orn'ment," [...] said Dorothy, sleepily. But <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> upon her couch, nevertheless, {{and in spite of}} all her worries was soon in the land of dreams.|$|E
60|$|Joan ached {{in every}} muscle {{and she was}} too tired to care what {{happened}} round the camp-fire. Jim had been close to her all day and that had kept up her spirit. It was not yet dark when <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> for the night.|$|E
60|$|She {{prepared}} for bed, and placing the lamp {{on the edge}} of the bureau, <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> to become absorbed in a paper-backed novel. The mill-clock was striking ten when she finished. There was a dreamy light in her eyes and a glow upon her face.|$|E
60|$|As {{their former}} nap had been interrupted, they readily agreed to Aquareine's {{proposal}} {{and at once}} went to their couches and composed themselves to slumber. When they were asleep, the fairy mermaid charmed her golden sword and then <b>she</b> also <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> to rest herself.|$|R
6000|$|... "And what perplexes you now, dear George?" [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>laying</b> <b>down</b> {{her work}} and looking up in his face with that straightforward, earnest gaze that in days of yore had set the stout backwoodsman's heart on fire, and still kept it in a {{perennial}} blaze.|$|R
60|$|Neale {{hesitated a}} moment, then {{reaching}} into the aperture, he got his hands under the girl's arms and carefully drew her out upon the grass. <b>She</b> <b>lay</b> face <b>down,</b> her hair a tumbled mass, her body inert. Neale's quick eye searched for bloodstains, but found none.|$|R
60|$|Rachel obeyed, and Noie sat by her, {{holding her}} hand, till {{presently}} {{her eyes shut}} and she slept. But Noie did not sleep. All that night she sat there watching and listening, till at length the dawn came and <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> also by the door and rested.|$|E
60|$|The Lady Rowena, {{with three}} of her attendants {{standing}} at her back, and arranging her hair ere <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> to rest, was seated {{in the sort of}} throne already mentioned, and looked as if born to exact general homage. The Pilgrim acknowledged her claim to it by a low genuflection.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> on her {{bed with}} a heavy sigh, and tried to sleep. It was useless. The dull weariness of herself which now possessed her was not the weariness which finds its remedy in repose. She rose again and sat by the window, looking out listlessly over the sea.|$|E
50|$|Prevenda composes, or more {{precisely}} <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> <b>down</b> visual-tactile matter, like the ashes of her feelings, over simple urban signs of human presence. The processes of growing of the images and of the matters they wear, the densification of the surfaces - symbolically speaking - build for the artist a niche of introspection. It’s a painting of emotional combustion, serious in inventiveness, without falling into the ludic. The technique of the artist produces an extremely rich pictural texture without intentionally recovering the ridiculous. Prevenda manufactures bricolating matters and materials without exalting the poverist non-finite. As the musical form close to her painting {{seems to be an}} ample organ tocatta.|$|R
5000|$|Back at the Suarez house, Hilda is {{knitting}} {{while the}} cemetery girls are sleeping. As she’s checking {{one of them}} to see if she’s breathing, the police pull up. “Who died?” one of them asks. It turns out it’s a policewoman who knows Hilda, and she has brought Justin home. He had wrecked their car into a tree. Hilda finally snaps out of it and tells [...] "the girls" [...] they have to leave, then has a heart-to-heart with Justin. First, <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> <b>down</b> the law, then tells him it’s OK to grieve. He tells her he just wanted his dad to be proud of him. They embrace and cry.|$|R
5000|$|Susan is then {{invited by}} a male resident, naked from the waist up, to take a ride around the camp's lake in his motor boat. Susan asks to be dropped off {{on the other side}} of the lake, where <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> <b>down,</b> falls asleep and dreams of disrobing and {{swimming}} naked in the lake. In the dream, Johnny swims up to her, but she is embarrassed by their nudity and asks him to leave. When Susan wakes up, Johnny is there with an update on the car and she tells him that that evening the director has asked them to perform a scene together from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet [...]|$|R
6000|$|... "Fetch me {{water from}} the spring!" [...] Mali said, authoritatively, in Polynesian. Without a moment's delay the girl darted off {{at the top of}} her speed, and soon {{returned}} with a large calabash full of fresh cool water, which <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> respectfully by the taboo line, not daring to cross it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Have they?" [...] {{she said}} faintly. Then <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> again, {{and it seemed}} to her that a very long time elapsed. Suddenly recollecting that Trefusis had {{supported}} her gently with his hand to prevent her falling back too rudely, she rose again, and this time got upon her feet with his help.|$|E
60|$|And {{she got up}} and strolled away again. By {{the time}} she returned, Surajah had lain down to sleep, and Ibrahim was on watch. Annie was, by this time, tired enough to be ready for sleep again, and, {{wrapping}} herself in a rug, <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> at a short distance from the others.|$|E
60|$|The girl understood, {{and taking}} the long knife <b>she</b> entered and <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> upon the soft grasses while Tarzan of the Apes {{stretched}} himself upon the ground across the entrance.|$|R
6000|$|I {{remember}} {{a girl in}} a coffee-house saying, [...] "I never drink spirits when in a public-'ouse." [...] She was a young and pretty waitress, and <b>she</b> was <b>laying</b> <b>down</b> to another waitress her pre-eminent respectability and discretion. Mrs. Grundy drew the line at spirits, but allowed that it was quite proper for a clean young girl to drink beer, and to go into a public-house to drink it.|$|R
6000|$|At length she cannot see it plainly, for {{the tears}} that fill her eyes; and then <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> her head <b>down</b> on his breast, and puts {{her arms around his}} neck, saying, 'Oh Walter, dearest love, I am so happy!' ...|$|R
