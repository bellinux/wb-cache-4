5|$|Tax {{revenue from}} the Belgian Congo enabled the Belgian {{government}} in exile and Free Belgian Forces to fund themselves, unlike most other states in exile, which operated through subsidies and donations from sympathetic governments. It also meant that the Belgian gold reserves, which had been moved to London in 1940, were not needed to fund the war effort, and therefore were <b>still</b> <b>available</b> {{at the end of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|The Natural History is {{generally}} divided into the organic {{plants and animals}} and the inorganic matter, although there are frequent digressions in each section.

5|$|The Whistleblower is a Canadian–German co-production. Weisz {{received}} the script from producer Amy Kaufman in 2007.

5|$|VHS {{tapes of}} Animaniacs were {{released}} in the United States and in the United Kingdom. All of these tapes are out of production, but are <b>still</b> <b>available</b> at online sellers. The episodes featured are jumbled at random and are in no particular order with the series. Each video featured four to five episodes each and accompanied {{by a handful of}} shorter skits, with a running time of about 45 minutes.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{only about}} $15,000 from the {{building}} fund was <b>still</b> <b>available</b> since money had already been spent on buying the property and materials from the Mellon Mansion. Further fund raising generated 1,200 pledges, 95 percent of which were fulfilled: 60 {{percent of the money}} came from 10 percent of the parishioners and approximately 10 percent of the people did not contribute at all. During this time, all of the books concerning the finances of the construction of the new church were kept by ladies of the St. Peter's Cenacle. The ladies not only recorded all of the pledges and collections, but they also recorded all notices and minutes from their meetings. While the church was being built, the Campaigners met almost every evening.|$|E

5|$|Berlioz's {{version is}} one of many which combine the Italian and French scores, {{although}} it is the most influential and well regarded. Since about 1870 three-act adaptations of the Berlioz score, translating it back into Italian and restoring much of the music from the 1774 French version which Berlioz had left out, were common. An 1889 edition for contralto, published by Ricordi, became the most popular. On occasion the role of Orfeo has even been transposed down an octave for a baritone to sing. Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Hermann Prey are two notable baritones who have performed the role in Germany. Fischer-Dieskau recorded the opera several times; his recordings are <b>still</b> <b>available</b> commercially.|$|E
5|$|Desolate North is {{the debut}} studio album by the funeral doom metal band Celestiial, first {{released}} by Bindrune Recordings on June 6, 2006. It comprises the five tracks from Celestiial's demo, Ashen, combined with three more tracks recorded separately. It was written, performed and recorded entirely by Tanner Anderson, {{the member of}} Celestiial, and was never written to be an album or to be performed. The Bindrune CD release is out-of-print, but Desolate North is <b>still</b> <b>available</b> digitally and in LP-format, the latter having been released by music distributor Handmade Birds in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{upheaval}} on shore, {{the arrival of}} the British blockade squadron provoked Renaud into taking action. Although the defences of Île de France were well prepared under Malartic's orders, food supplies were running low, with only rice <b>still</b> <b>available</b> in quantity. The potential for famine and consequent social unrest among the slave population was severe and Renaud sailed immediately to intercept Centurion and Diomede. The French squadron comprised the 40-gun frigate Cybèle under Captain Pierre Tréhouart, the 36-gun Prudente under Renaud, and the 14-gun brig Coureur under lieutenant de vaisseau Garaud. The 20-gun privateer corvettes Jean-Bart and Rosalie, as well as the aviso Sans-Culotte, accompanied the two frigates. The ships' crews were heavily augmented by volunteers, including a young Robert Surcouf on Cybèle, as well as a detachment of soldiers.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, Capper {{joined the}} Hampshire Home Guard and {{remained}} on duty with the unit until 1943. Post-War he retired fully to Bramdean House and remained there until {{shortly before his}} death. He was widowed in 1953 and died at Esperance Nursing Home in Eastbourne in May 1955, leaving a daughter. In 1971, his collected papers, and those of his brother Thompson, who had been an instructor at the Staff College, Camberley, were donated to the Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives at King's College London where they are <b>still</b> <b>available</b> to researchers.|$|E
5|$|Following his death, a rumour abounded that he {{had been}} killed {{charging}} the German lines on horseback. This story has persisted despite eye-witness accounts to the contrary. Capper was buried in Lillers Communal Cemetery behind British lines and his grave is surmounted by a Commonwealth War Graves Commission headstone. He is also commemorated on the War Memorial in Rayne, Essex, where he spent much of his boyhood with his uncle, the Rector of Rayne, Rev W S Hemming. His collected papers were donated to King's College in 1971, where they are <b>still</b> <b>available</b> to researchers and contain a wide selection of primary materials concerning the warfare of the early twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, some {{manufacturers}} (notably Samsung) introduced SSD controllers that extended {{the concept of}} BGC to analyze the file system used on the SSD, to identify recently deleted files and unpartitioned space. Samsung claimed that this would ensure that even systems (operating systems and SATA controller hardware) which do not support TRIM could achieve similar performance. The operation of the Samsung implementation appeared to assume and require an NTFS file system. It is not clear if this feature is <b>still</b> <b>available</b> in currently shipping SSDs from these manufacturers. Systematic data corruption has been reported on these drives {{if they are not}} formatted properly using MBR and NTFS.|$|E

5|$|Most {{information}} about Magnus is gleaned from Norse sagas and chronicles, which began appearing during the 12th century. The most important sources <b>still</b> <b>available</b> are the Norwegian chronicles Historia de Antiquitate Regum Norwagiensium by Theodoric the Monk and the anonymous Ágrip af Noregskonungasögum (or simply Ágrip) from the 1180s and the Icelandic sagas Heimskringla (by Snorri Sturluson), Morkinskinna and Fagrskinna, which date {{to about the}} 1220s. While the later sagas are the most detailed accounts, they are also generally considered the least reliable. Additional {{information about}} Magnus, in particular his campaigns, is found in sources from the British Isles, which included contemporary accounts.|$|E
5|$|On April 22, 2013, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings {{announced}} not {{to renew}} their existing deal with Viacom. Since then, Viacom's deal with Netflix expired and removed its shows such as SpongeBob, and Dora the Explorer. However, SpongeBob is <b>still</b> <b>available</b> to stream on Netflix in Canada. On June 4, 2013, Viacom announced a multi-year licensing agreement moving its programmings, such as SpongeBob and Dora the Explorer, to Amazon.com, Netflix's top competitor. Amazon agreed {{to pay more than}} $200 million to Viacom for the license, its largest subscription streaming transaction ever.|$|E

5|$|On October 20, 2009, Apple {{released}} a MacBook that {{introduced a new}} polycarbonate (plastic) unibody design, faster DDR3 memory, a multi-touch trackpad, an LED-backlit display, and a built-in seven-hour battery. The polycarbonate unibody MacBook, like its aluminum predecessor, lacks FireWire and, like the 13-inch MacBook Pro, has a combined audio in/out port. There is no infrared port and the Apple Remote is not included. On May 18, 2010, the MacBook was refreshed with a faster processor, a faster graphics card, improved battery life, {{and the ability to}} pass audio through the Mini DisplayPort connector. On July 20, 2011, the MacBook was discontinued for consumer purchases, but was <b>still</b> <b>available</b> to educational institutions until February 2012.|$|E
5|$|Rod Jones {{was known}} as a hard hitter and a {{world-class}} track star, but was a controversial selection because, coming from the run-heavy Southwest Conference, his pass-coverage skills were unknown. At 5'11", 165lbs., he was considered undersized for the NFL. Jones was the first defensive back selected, but was rated no better than fifth-best by most scouting services. The Buccaneers were criticized for taking linebacker Jackie Walker with their third pick, when Kevin Murphy of the national champion Oklahoma Sooners was <b>still</b> <b>available.</b> The Buccaneers did eventually draft Murphy, who they were surprised to find <b>still</b> <b>available</b> with their 40th overall selection. Murphy was believed to have fallen due to rumors of a knee injury. The Buccaneers had rated both Walker and Murphy among the top 15 players in the draft. Craig Swoope was rated as the best safety in the draft, but fell to the fourth round because of a previous charge (and acquittal) of conspiracy to distribute cocaine. Swoope was eventually the only Buccaneer to achieve any kind of postseason honors in 1986, being selected to the Football Digest All-Rookie team. The team went for big offensive linemen in the later rounds. One of them was J.D. Maarleveld, the first cancer patient drafted by the NFL. Maarleveld was considered to have been a second-round talent, but fell {{all the way to the}} fifth round. Belief that Maarleveld was worth much more money than the average fifth-rounder caused his agent, Greg Marotta, to advise him to reject the Buccaneers' offer and sign with the USFL Baltimore Stars. Maarleveld was eventually able to reach agreement with the Buccaneers.|$|E
5|$|Sales {{performance}} was disappointing. Jaguar {{had intended to}} produce up to 350 cars, but production ceased in 1994 with 275 production cars produced, not all {{of which had been}} sold; some left-hand drive examples were <b>still</b> <b>available</b> in 1997. The recession left many of those who placed a deposit unable to complete the purchase. The index linking of contracts exacerbated the issue, and added almost £200,000 to the purchase price between early 1990 and mid-1992. The McLaren F1 suffered from similarly poor sales performance, with just 71 cars sold against McLaren's target of 300. McLaren's F1 program eventually turned a small profit thanks to the sale and servicing of the 28 GTR racing variants produced.|$|E
