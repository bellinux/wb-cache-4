Under the circumstance of networking, it is undoubted {{a new way to}} train autonomous abilities of learners with applied technology benefits the development of learners in future. Therefore, both instructors and learners have necessity to master and share some skills and strategies of autonomous learning by means of applied technology. It is also essential that learners enhance their abilities to manage their time and develop a positive attitude and a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibilities</b> towards learning. Along with the advance of networking and multimedia college linguistic education is faced with great challenges and new opportunities. The dominant position of learners and the guidance role of instructors in the learning process is becoming increasingly prominent. Then the way of autonomous learning is gradually turning out to be an essential mode of learning in colleg...|$|E
30|$|The above {{arguments}} are well supported by existing literature. In {{the last few}} decades, academics, politicians, and civil analysts have cited the falling level of community involvement, an issue for concern; community involvement has been fundamental {{to the process of}} development. Fyfe (2009) says that community engagement is the most important approach to addressing demographically and geographically emphasized programs. While many argue that engagement initiatives among communities are difficult to estimate empirically, some studies also reveal reviews of major regeneration development, demonstrating the importance of community engagement. It has been argued that despite the acceptance of community engagement, evidence does not support the prevalence of such engagement, which met mixed results. Furthermore, the critical analysis suggests that community engagement creates a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibilities</b> for communities in terms of taking care of their surroundings (Lawson, and Kearns 2010). The literature around “community participation” is discussed in depth; the notion is {{that it is difficult to}} define in most accepted ways. The term is understood and spelt differently by numerous bodies as well as individual scholars, with some conflicting ideologies (Morris 2006). The benefits of community participation in a society are very extensive; some would say it is very comprehensive. Following decades of professional or state-led interventions, to be seen, the community has been an important knowledge resource, if captured, will lead to enhanced and responsible services. This aspect is based upon the simple base that the community knows best about their own problems, thus allowing policy makers to act according to that (Rydin, and Pennington 2000; Maguire, and Truscott 2006).|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} explores identity {{processes and}} approaches to professional practice of Tibetan educators working within schools {{administered by the}} Tibetan Government-in-exile (TGIE) in India and Nepal. Since 1960, schools administered by the TGIE have been centrally involved in the diaspora’s efforts to support the physical and cultural survival of individuals, and of {{the community as a}} whole. Schools attempt to support the development of youth who identify both as global citizens, and as Tibetans whose practices are consistent with historical values. Sociocultural theories of identity and community, agency and history-in-person, post-structural theories of globalization, and theories of liberatory pedagogy, are utilized to interpret data from open-ended interviews with 29 educators. Educators’ perceptions of their personal histories within the Tibetan diasporic struggle, their views on their positioning in relation {{to the rest of the}} world, and their processes of negotiating and making <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibilities</b> they associate with their work are investigated. Analysis reveals differing perspectives of four generations. The generations are distinguished by their circumstances in their early years: those born before or during their family’s 1959 exodus from Tibet, those born in refugee camps in the 1960 s, those born in the early years of refugee settlements in the 1970 s, and New Arrivals who escaped from Tibet in the 1980 s. Personal histories, current circumstances, globalization, and hoped-for futures, frame the contexts in which educators shape and implement their professional practices. Notions of personal and community empowerment and liberatory pedagogy are apparent as educators work with youth to promote particular futures for their community. Five decades of change globally and within Tibetan communities in India and Nepal, have altered the daily lives of Tibetans and generated shifts in the futures educators can imagine. These changes are reflected in an increasingly global outlook amongst Tibetan teachers (and students), and tension in the community struggles to define and maintain Tibetan national identity in diaspora. Efforts of educators to support and maintain cultural continuity and community affiliation for new generations of youth are fraught with challenges, necessitating creativity and innovation in vision and in practice...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{sought to}} explore the {{relationship}} between Iranian EFL teachers’ transformational leadership style and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility.</b> To do so, 183 Iranian EFL teachers took part in this study. The data were collected through Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (Avolio, Bass & Jung, 1995) and Teachers’ Responsibility Scale (Lauermann & Karabenick, 2013). To analyse the data, spearman correlation and linear regression were run. The results revealed that Iranian EFL teachers’ transformational leadership style was significantly correlated with their <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility.</b> Moreover, {{it was found that}} transformational leadership style was a positive predictor <b>of</b> teachers’ <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility.</b> It was concluded that higher transformational leadership styles contributes to higher <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility,</b> which in turn affects students’ learning and help them achieve their educational purposes. The finding of this study is particularly significant for educational practitioners and teachers, as it will help teachers focus on these two individual characteristics in order to augment both teaching and learning quality...|$|R

40|$|Responsibility can {{be defined}} as the belief that one {{possesses}} the pivotal power to provoke or prevent subjective crucial outcomes. Responsibility is crucial in the field of law. Institutions seeking to control individuals need to identify responsible agents to adequately punish or reward them. The present study is the first to empirically test the influence of task-unrelated physical effort on the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility.</b> The <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> was measured with a Likert-type response format. In Experiment 1, effort was manipulated independently of the task by requiring the participants to pull stretch bands of varying resistance levels. In Experiment 2, effort was manipulated by requiring the participants to press the keyboard either fast or slowly. Our results suggest the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> is not significantly influenced by effort. However, the participants on average felt more responsible in moral dilemmas than in neutral dilemmas. Moreover, this effect was stronger for females who experienced a greater <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> than males. These results allow us to conclude that agency and responsibility might not be connected in the ways previously described in the literature...|$|R

Three dimensions <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> were identified; responsibility for the learning process, student achievement and establishing a supportive social network. Students’ <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> personal <b>responsibility</b> was related to their ascriptions <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> to parents and teachers and their own subject-specific motivation and school achievement. All of these were found related to parents’ responsibility judgements and expectancies.
