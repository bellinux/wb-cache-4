40|$|Abstract:- This study {{examines}} the optimal run {{time for the}} economic manufacturing quantity (EMQ) model with failure-in-work, backlogging, and random breakdown happening in <b>stock-piling</b> time. A recent article by Chiu and Chiu [Mathematical modeling for production system with backlogging and failure in repair, Journal of Scientific & Industrial Research, 65 (2006) 499 - 506] investigated optimal lot-size for EMQ model with backordering and failure-in-rework. By incorporating random machine breakdown-another inevitable reliability factor into their model, this research examines its effects on the optimal run time and on the long-run average costs. Mathematical modeling and cost analysis are employed and the renewal reward theorem is used to cope with variable cycle length. Convexity of the expected production- inventory cost function is proved. An optimal replenishment policy that minimizes overall costs is derived for such an unreliable system. Numerical example is provided to show its practical usage. Managers in the field can adopt this run time decision to establish their own robust production plan accordingly...|$|E
40|$|In many {{important}} settings, promotions {{are a key}} instrument for driving sales and profits. Examples include promotions in supermarkets among others. The Promotion Optimization Problem (POP) is a challenging problem as the retailer needs to decide which products to promote, what is the depth of price discounts and finally, when to schedule the promotions. We introduce and study an optimization formulation that captures several important business requirements as constraints. We propose two general classes of demand functions depending on whether past prices have a multiplicative or an additive effect on current demand. These functions capture the promotion fatigue effect emerging from the <b>stock-piling</b> behavior of consumers and can be easily estimated from data. The objective is nonlinear (neither convex nor concave) and the feasible region has linear constraints with integer variables. Since the exact formulation is “hard”, we propose a linear approximation {{that allows us to}} solve the problem efficiently as a linear program (LP) by showing the integrality of the integer program (IP) formulation. We develop analytical results on the accuracy of the approximation relative to the optimal (but intractable) POP solution by showing guarantees relative to the optimal profits. In addition, we show computationally that the formulation solves fast in practice using actual data from a grocery retailer and that the accuracy is high. Together with our industry collaborators from Oracle Retail, our framework allows us to develop a tool which can help supermarket managers t...|$|E
