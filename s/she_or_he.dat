5|$|The Svalbard Treaty of 1920 {{established}} full Norwegian {{sovereignty over}} the archipelago. The treaty came {{into effect in}} 1925, following the Svalbard Act that established {{the institution of the}} Governor of Svalbard. <b>She</b> <b>or</b> <b>he</b> holds the responsibility as both county governor and chief of police, as well as holding other authority granted from the executive branch. Duties include environmental policy, family law, law enforcement, search and rescue, tourism management, information services, contact with foreign settlements and judge in some areas of maritime inquiries and judicial examinations—albeit never in the same cases as acting as police. Kjerstin Askholt has been governor since 2015; she is assisted by a staff of 26 professionals. The institution is subordinate to the Ministry of Justice and the Police, but reports to other ministries in matters within their portfolio.|$|E
25|$|In the Polity of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), {{the pastor}} and {{associate}} pastor(s) have votes {{as members of}} the session on any and all matters; however, often <b>she</b> <b>or</b> <b>he</b> refrains from voting except in tie situations. The Pastor is not a voting member of the congregation.|$|E
25|$|Immigrant {{petition}} (Form I-140 or Form I-130)– in {{the first}} step, USCIS approves the immigrant petition by a qualifying relative, an employer, or in rare cases, such as with an investor visa, the applicant himself. If a sibling is applying, <b>she</b> <b>or</b> <b>he</b> must have the same parents as the applicant.|$|E
5000|$|Gastprofessoren: A visiting scholar. If <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> lectures <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is {{sometimes}} also called a visiting professor. Further, a visiting scholar can also {{work as a}} Vertretungsprofessor.|$|R
5000|$|Two people {{meet and}} {{exchange}} closed bags, {{with the understanding}} that one of them contains money, and the other contains a purchase. Either player can choose to honor the deal by putting into his or her bag what <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> agreed, <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> can defect by handing over an empty bag.|$|R
50|$|A {{woman is}} {{pregnant}} with her brother's child. He takes her to the greenwood to have her child, but <b>she</b> dies (<b>or</b> <b>he</b> kills her at her request). He buries her and laments her death.|$|R
25|$|Permission {{from the}} {{employee}} {{is not required}} for deductions to be assessed. However, if the employee is a conscientious objector, that is refuses membership in a trade union {{on the grounds of}} conscience, <b>she</b> <b>or</b> <b>he</b> may request that their fees are paid to a fund administered by the Department of Labour.|$|E
25|$|It {{also created}} the Joint Board for the Enrollment of Actuaries, which {{licenses}} actuaries {{to perform a}} variety of actuarial tasks required of pension plans under ERISA. The Joint Board administers two examinations to prospective Enrolled Actuaries. After an individual passes the two exams and completes sufficient relevant professional experience, <b>she</b> <b>or</b> <b>he</b> becomes an Enrolled Actuary.|$|E
25|$|In most {{denominations}} {{the pastor}} serves as Moderator and presides over the session (primus inter pares), {{in which all}} elders have an equal vote. In some denominations, the pastor is not given a vote; however, in a sitting body of an even number or with a quorum of the session counted <b>she</b> <b>or</b> <b>he</b> can break a tie by a casting vote.|$|E
50|$|The show's {{participants}} are also interviewed {{over the course}} of game play; each student talks for 15 seconds or so, usually about activities in which <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> participates <b>or</b> interests <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> has.|$|R
60|$|Yet for aught I knew, {{the whole}} thing might have blown up at a minute's notice, <b>she,</b> <b>he,</b> <b>or</b> it being an {{arrangement}} of uncertain temper.|$|R
60|$|She remembered HE {{had bought}} no {{engagement}} ring at all, and she preferred William, {{who was not}} mean, if he were foolish. But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes <b>she</b> wore; <b>or</b> <b>he</b> told his mother with glee how {{they went to the}} theatre like great swells.|$|R
25|$|There {{are many}} ways to {{discriminate}} against people based on disabilities, including psychological ones. Anyone known to have a history of mental disorders can be considered disabled. Employers with more than 15 employees must take care to treat all employees fairly and with any accommodations needed. Even when an employee is doing a job exceptionally well, <b>she</b> <b>or</b> <b>he</b> is not necessarily no longer disabled; employers must continue to follow all policies for the disabled.|$|E
25|$|If {{the master}} makes a {{declaration}} of the slave's freedom, whether in jest or earnest, {{in the presence of}} the slave or another, then such a declaration becomes legally binding. Similarly, the master may promise manumission (verbally or in writing) that the slave is to be freed upon the former's death. Lastly, a slave is also freed automatically if <b>she</b> <b>or</b> <b>he</b> comes into the possession of a master who is directly related to her or him.|$|E
25|$|The sixteen {{subjects}} used {{to calculate}} the total must include the three core subjects – English, Swedish, and Mathematics. If the pupil fails any of the core subjects, <b>she</b> <b>or</b> <b>he</b> lacks qualification to attend secondary school. However, the student can still attend the secondary school individual program (individuellt program (IV)), either to gain competence in the core subjects and start a secondary school program or to complete the individual program and satisfy the requirements for a student degree (see below).|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why not? It {{is such a}} big house, you can't think. You {{need not}} come near the front apartments, if you think we shall be ashamed of you in your working clothes. How came you not to dress up a bit, Sol? Still, Berta won't mind it much. She says Lord Mountclere must take her as <b>she</b> is, <b>or</b> <b>he</b> is kindly welcome to leave her.' ...|$|R
50|$|Prior to Moore's {{recordings}} and Audichron equipment, an operator stationed {{in a booth}} would await {{the glow of a}} signal lamp, indicating that a subscriber had dialed the service; <b>she</b> (<b>or,</b> sometimes, <b>he)</b> would then announce the time at 10-second intervals until the lamp was extinguished. Callers reaching a disconnected number would be informed by the operator personally. Moore had one of these reading jobs herself before she was formally recorded.|$|R
60|$|A clever {{woman and}} {{thoroughly}} coached, thought I. Well, Zikali was {{never one to}} suffer fools, and doubtless she is another of the pawns whom he uses on his board of policy. Oh! <b>she,</b> <b>or</b> rather <b>he</b> was right; my heart was in Zululand, though {{not in the way}} he thought, and I longed to see the end of that great game played by a wizard against a despot and his hosts.|$|R
25|$|The way a DP can bind {{given this}} domain {{depends on the}} kind of that DP that is being bound. Anaphors (reflexives pronouns like herself and reciprocals like each other) must be bound in their domain, meaning they must have a c-commanding {{antecedent}} in their domain. Pronouns (such as <b>she</b> <b>or</b> <b>he)</b> must not be bound in their domain, meaning they cannot have a c-commanding antecedent in their domain. Finally, R-expressions (such as proper names, descriptions, or epithets) must not be bound, meaning they must not have a c-commanding antecedent at all.|$|E
25|$|An {{evolutionary}} psychology explanation for conversion disorder {{is that the}} symptoms may have been evolutionarily advantageous during warfare. A non-combatant with these symptoms signals non-verbally, possibly to someone speaking a different language, that <b>she</b> <b>or</b> <b>he</b> is not dangerous as a combatant and also may be carrying some form of dangerous infectious disease. This can explain that conversion disorder may develop following a threatening situation, {{that there may be}} a group effect with many people simultaneously developing similar symptoms (as in mass psychogenic illness), and the gender difference in prevalence.|$|E
25|$|In {{variations}} of two-handed play, no cards are initially dealt, a distinction {{from all other}} variations. Instead, the entire deck is placed face-down on the playing surface between the two players to form the widow. One player begins the hand-building process by drawing the top card of the widow. The player can either keep that card for her or his hand or reject the card. If the player chooses to hold the initial card, the player then draws a second card from the widow, then places it face-down, without looking at it, creating a discard pile. If the player rejects the first card, the card becomes the first card in the discard pile. The second card drawn from the widow must be kept, regardless of whether <b>she</b> <b>or</b> <b>he</b> preferred the first card. Players alternate turns in this hand-building process until all cards are chosen.|$|E
60|$|He went on. Molly {{was sitting}} quite still, {{looking into the}} shrubbery. He assumed she was listening; but whether <b>she</b> was <b>or</b> not, <b>he</b> must go on talking. The {{situation}} was difficult. Silence would make it more difficult.|$|R
60|$|They parted {{near to the}} Hanover Gate, but to-night he did {{not stand}} {{watching}} her as he had always done till she waved a last good-bye to him just before disappearing; so whether <b>she</b> turned <b>or</b> not <b>he</b> never knew.|$|R
5000|$|She {{stated in}} a {{separate}} interview: I do not understand why God can be all love and still inflict this kind of pain on people. This God is an underachiever. He does not do whatever {{he is supposed to}} be doing, whatever his sex is. Whether <b>he's</b> an it <b>or</b> a <b>she</b> <b>or</b> a <b>he</b> <b>or</b> whatever. But I'm sure that if you were a god or if I were the God, I would be doing a better job. Therefore, the only conclusion can be that possibly, God does not exist.|$|R
25|$|Authorship is {{a primary}} basis that {{employers}} use to evaluate academic personnel for employment, promotion, and tenure. In academic publishing, authorship of a work is claimed by those making intellectual contributions to {{the completion of the}} research described in the work. In simple cases, a solitary scholar carries out a research project and writes the subsequent article or book. In many disciplines, however, collaboration is the norm and issues of authorship can be controversial. In these contexts, authorship can encompass activities other than writing the article; a researcher who comes up with an experimental design and analyzes the data may be considered an author, even if <b>she</b> <b>or</b> <b>he</b> had little role in composing the text describing the results. According to some standards, even writing the entire article would not constitute authorship unless the writer was also involved in at least one other phase of the project.|$|E
25|$|Since LGBT {{people began}} to {{organize}} for their social and legal rights, access to equal health care has remained an important but often not primary issue. LGBT-specific health organizations have been formed, including charities educating on specific issues, health clinics, and even professional organizations for LGBT people and their allies. Many of them have advocated for specific changes to various governmental practices, and the ongoing effort to legalize same-sex marriage often includes examples of LGBT people unable to secure health coverage equivalent to that of their heterosexual counterparts. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) in the United States includes new protections for LGBT people. Under the ACA insurers can no longer turn someone away just because <b>she</b> <b>or</b> <b>he</b> is lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. In addition, ACA is funding preventive efforts for communities, including {{millions of dollars to}} use evidence-based interventions to address HIV-related health disparities. The Department of Health and Human Services is working with community centers serving the LGBT community to employ proven prevention strategies.|$|E
25|$|In the {{simplest}} {{case of a}} contractual breach, the performance that was owed will merely be the payment of a provable debt (an agreed sum of money). In this case, the Sale of Goods Act 1979 section 49 allows for a summary action for price of goods or services, meaning a quick set of court procedure rules are followed. Consumers also benefit under sections 48A-E, with a specific {{right to have a}} broken product to be repaired. An added benefit is that if a claimant brings an action for debt, <b>she</b> <b>or</b> <b>he</b> will have no further duty to mitigate his loss. This was another requirement that common law courts had invented, before a claim for breach of contract could be enforced. For instance, in contracts for services that spanned {{a long period of time}} (e.g. 5 years), the courts would often state that because a claimant should be able to find alternative work in a few months, and so should not receive money for the whole contract's duration. However, White & Carter (Councils) Ltd v McGregor an advertising company had a contract to display adverts for McGregor's garage business on public dustbins. McGregor said he wished to cancel the deal, but White & Carter Ltd refused, displayed the adverts anyway, and demanded the full sum of money. McGregor argued that they should have attempted to mitigate their loss by finding other clients, but the majority of the Lords held there was no further duty to mitigate. Claims in debt were different from damages.|$|E
60|$|They {{were passing}} a brilliantly-lit corner, {{and the light}} flashed upon his strong, set face with its heavy eyebrows and firm lips. He leaned back and laughed hoarsely. Was it her fancy, <b>she</b> wondered, <b>or</b> did <b>he</b> seem not wholly at his ease.|$|R
60|$|She {{drew her}} fingers away, and sank {{down into her}} easy-chair. Her head was buried in her hands. Was <b>she</b> {{thinking}} <b>or</b> weeping? <b>He</b> could not decide. While he hesitated she looked up, and he {{saw that there was}} no trace of tears upon her face.|$|R
6000|$|As to Paulina, {{the child}} was at once happy and mute, busy and watchful. Her father {{frequently}} lifted her to his knee; she would sit there till <b>she</b> felt <b>or</b> fancied <b>he</b> grew restless; then it was--"Papa, put me down; I shall tire you with my weight." ...|$|R
25|$|Since {{one might}} not travel faster than light, one might {{conclude}} that a human can never travel further from the Earth than 40 light-years if the traveler is active between the age of 20 and 60. A traveler would then {{never be able to}} reach more than the very few star systems which exist within the limit of 20–40 light-years from the Earth. This is a mistaken conclusion: because of time dilation, the traveler can travel thousands of light-years during their 40 active years. If the spaceship accelerates at a constant 1g (in its own changing frame of reference), it will, after 354 days, reach speeds a little under the speed of light (for an observer on Earth), and time dilation will increase their lifespan to thousands of Earth years, seen from the reference system of the Solar System, but the traveler's subjective lifespan will not thereby change. If the traveler returns to the Earth, <b>she</b> <b>or</b> <b>he</b> will land thousands of years into the Earth's future. Their speed will not be seen as higher than the speed of light by observers on Earth, and the traveler will not measure their speed as being higher than the speed of light, but will see a length contraction of the universe in their direction of travel. And as the traveler turns around to return, the Earth will seem to experience much more time than the traveler does. So, while their (ordinary) coordinate speed cannot exceed c, their proper speed (distance as seen by Earth divided by their proper time) can be much greater than c. This is seen in statistical studies of muons traveling much further than c times their half-life (at rest), if traveling close to c.|$|E
500|$|Balzac's use of repeat characters, {{moving in}} and out of the Comédies books, {{strengthens}} the realist representation. [...] "When the characters reappear", notes Rogers, [...] "they do not step out of nowhere; they emerge from the privacy of their own lives which, for an interval, we have not been allowed to see". He also used a realist technique which French novelist Marcel Proust later termed [...] "retrospective illumination", whereby a character's past is revealed long after <b>she</b> <b>or</b> <b>he</b> first appears.|$|E
500|$|According to {{traditional}} Jewish law, {{in the absence}} of a grown free Jewish male expert, a woman, a slave, or a child, that has the required skills, is also authorized to perform the circumcision, provided that <b>she</b> <b>or</b> <b>he</b> is Jewish. However, most streams of non-Orthodox Judaism allow female mohels, called mohalot ( [...] , the plural of [...] mohelet, feminine of mohel), without restriction. In 1984, Deborah Cohen became the first certified Reform mohelet; she was certified by the Berit Mila program of Reform Judaism.|$|E
60|$|Jude was exasperated, {{and went}} out to drag her in by main force. Then he {{suddenly}} lost his heat. Illuminated with the sense that all was over between them, and that it mattered not what <b>she</b> did, <b>or</b> <b>he,</b> her husband stood still, regarding her. Their lives were ruined, he thought; ruined by the fundamental error of their matrimonial union: that of having based a permanent contract on a temporary feeling which had no necessary connection with affinities that alone render a lifelong comradeship tolerable.|$|R
50|$|Lord Ingram and Chiel Wyet are {{brothers}} who {{fall in love}} with the same woman, Maisry. She falls in love with Wyet and becomes pregnant by him. Her father arranges the marriage to Lord Ingram. At the wedding, he learns of the baby; he may offer to claim the baby as his own, and <b>she</b> refuses, <b>or</b> <b>he</b> refuses. Lord Ingram and Chiel Wyet kill each other. Lady Maisry goes mad, resolving to beg, or go on pilgrimage, until she dies, and more for Lord Ingram than Chiel Wyet.|$|R
50|$|The Lure of the Local: Sense of Place in a Multicentered Society is a 1997 {{study of}} the sense of place, by American author and 1968 Guggenheim Fellowship winner Lucy Lippard. The phrase, coined by Lippard, in this study refers to a sense of place that an {{individual}} can have about where <b>she</b> lives, <b>or</b> where <b>he</b> lived in his childhood.|$|R
