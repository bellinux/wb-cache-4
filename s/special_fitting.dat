2500|$|An {{appeal was}} made to the Grand Fleet for volunteers for special service on 23 February 1918. Very few of the {{participants}} were aware of the objective. The cruisers involved in the blockade, including [...] were equipped in Chatham by over [...] for the <b>special</b> <b>fitting</b> out or stripping out (in the case of the ships to be sunk) of unnecessary equipment, including their masts. Iris, Daffodil and the submarines were converted in Portsmouth. The fleet made its rendezvous at Swin Deep, about [...] south of Clacton. The first opportunity for the raid was early April 1918 and on 2 April the fleet sailed and Zeebrugge was bombed by 65 Squadron from Dunkirk. The success of the raid depended upon smokescreens to protect the British ships from the fire of German coastal artillery but the wind direction was unfavourable and the attack was called off. Zeebrugge was visible to the fleet and the fleet to the Germans in Zeebrugge; seventy-seven ships of all sizes, some with their lights already switched off, had to make a sharp turn to the west to return to their bases.|$|E

50|$|Thales Introduced the Scorpion Helmet-Mounted Cueing System to the {{military}} aviation market in 2008. Scorpion was {{the winner of the}} Helmet Mounted Integrated Targeting (HMIT) program in 2010. Scorpion has the distinction of being the first color HMD introduced. It was developed for targeting pod, gimbaled sensor or high off-boresight missile cueing mission scenarios. Unlike most HMDs, which require custom helmets, Scorpion was designed to be installed on standard issue HGU-55/P and HGU-68/P helmets and is fully compatible with standard issue U.S. Pilot Flight Equipment without <b>special</b> <b>fitting.</b> It is also fully compatible with standard unmodified AN/AVS-9 Night Vision Goggles (NVG) and Panoramic Night Vision Goggles (PNVG).|$|E
50|$|Scorpion uses a novel {{optical system}} {{featuring}} a light-guide optical element (LOE) {{which provides a}} compact color collimated image to the pilot. This allows the display to be positioned between the pilot's eyes and NVGs. The display can be positioned as the pilot wishes. Sophisticated software correction accommodates the display position, providing an accurate image to the pilot and allowing the Scorpion HMCS to be installed onto a pilot's existing helmet with no <b>special</b> <b>fitting.</b> A visor can be deployed {{in front of the}} display providing protection during ejection. The visor can be clear, glare, high contrast, gradient, or laser protective. An NVG mount can be installed in place of the visor during flight. Once installed, NVGs can be placed in front of the display, thus allowing the pilot to view both the display symbols as well as the NVG image simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|An {{audiologist}} is {{a health-care}} professional specializing in identifying, diagnosing, treating and monitoring disorders of the auditory and vestibular system {{portions of the}} ear. Audiologists are trained to diagnose, manage and/or treat hearing, tinnitus, or balance problems. They dispense, manage, and rehabilitate hearing aids and assess candidacy for and map cochlear implants. They counsel families through a new diagnosis of hearing loss in infants, and help teach coping and compensation skills to late-deafened adults. They also help design and implement personal and industrial hearing safety programs, newborn hearing screening programs, school hearing screening programs, and provide <b>special</b> <b>fitting</b> ear plugs and other hearing protection devices to help prevent hearing loss. Audiologists are trained to evaluate peripheral vestibular disorders originating from inner ear pathologies. They also provide treatment for certain vestibular and balance disorders such as Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV). In addition, many audiologists work as auditory scientists in a research capacity.|$|E
50|$|Unlike water piping, if it the conduit {{is to be}} watertight, {{the idea}} is to keep water out, not in. In this case, gaskets are used with <b>special</b> <b>fittings,</b> such as the weatherhead leading from the {{overhead}} electrical mains to the electric meter.|$|R
50|$|Crimped or pressed {{connections}} use <b>special</b> <b>fittings</b> {{which are}} permanently attached to tubing with a powered crimper. The fittings, manufactured with a pre-installed sealant, slide over the tubing to be connected. High pressure {{is used to}} deform the fitting and compress the sealant against the inner tubing, creating a leakproof seal.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} ways to build a velomobile. One modern design is [...] "body-on-frame", in which a velomobile is made from a not-faired cycle plus a body. A {{standard}} cycle may be used, but often a custom cycle is used with <b>special</b> <b>fittings</b> to mount the body; the use of <b>special</b> <b>fittings</b> tends to improve fit and durability, and can also reduce weight. Body-on-frame construction allows flexible configuration: the body may be of any construction, as it {{does not need to be}} self-supporting, and various bodies can be used with various frames. Also, the body may be removed so the cycle alone can be used. However, the overall weight of body-on-frame is often higher than alternatives, as the body does have some intrinsic strength, yet this is not used to reduce the weight of the frame.|$|R

40|$|This study uses X-ray {{diffraction}} (XRD) {{techniques to}} investigate the nanostructural features {{of a series of}} four Pd/C catalysts, which had the same load, 0. 51 +/- 0. 02 wt%, as palladium, with significantly different dispersions, obtained by applying different temperature ageings up to 873 K. By means of a Rietveld refinement, performed using a <b>special</b> <b>fitting</b> procedure, which takes into account the various contributions to the background scattering, the palladium fraction due to nanoparticles or clusters smaller than about 20 - 25 Angstrom could be determined. We have compared this Rietveld (absolute) quantitative method with a simpler, but less precise, single-peak (relative) XRD analysis, interesting for fast industrial applications. The Pd fractions due to nanoparticles, as determined by the two methods, are close each other for all samples investigated, apart from one for which the disagreement is near 20 %...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the need}} for <b>special</b> <b>fitting</b> strategies, {{improvements}} in speech discrimination tests {{support the use of}} cochlear implantation (CI) for patients with Cogan syndrome. Adequate preimplant counselling is mandatory, to prevent high expectations and to stress the necessity for bilateral implantation. Objective: In 60 % of patients with Cogan syndrome, CI remains the only treatment option. Literature data agree that once the electrode array is properly inserted, functional outcomes are very good. Nevertheless, results may deteriorate due to progressive cochlear ossification. A few studies have documented the outcomes of CI in these patients, but none have reported the long-term results. Methods: This was a retrospective study describing the outcomes of 3 implanted patients with Cogan syndrome – among 300 adult patients who received a cochlear implant, 3 had become deaf due to Cogan syndrome. Results: In one patient the cochlear ossification advanced and the speech perception abilities worsened from the highest category to identification of words in closed set. The second patient complained of an abrupt reduction of loudness at 18 months post-implant, which required an increased electrical stimulation. The third patient reached the identification category probably due to auditory dyssynchrony, as an atypical consequence of the syndrome...|$|E
50|$|Most non-local {{components}} {{used in the}} car {{simply could}} not be manufactured in Australia, although Joyce would {{have been willing to}} try local producers had they existed.
