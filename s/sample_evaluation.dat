40|$|In this work, {{we look at}} {{the problem}} of multi-class image {{classification}} in a semi-supervised learning framework. Given a small set of labeled images, and a much larger set of unlabeled images, we propose a semi-supervised learning method that combines bootstrapping with <b>sample</b> <b>evaluation,</b> to continuously update the learned models for each class. Bootstrapping involves using self-labeled images to re-train the learned models. To overcome the semantic drift that naive boot-strapping is prone to, we use additional <b>sample</b> <b>evaluation</b> methods based on the ideas of co-training and pairwise constraints, {{to determine whether or not}} a newly classified instance should be used for re-training. Experimental results show the usefulness of <b>sample</b> <b>evaluation,</b> when used in conjunction with bootstrapping. In particular, our method is able to achieve a 8 % improvement in overall accuracy over baseline bootstrapping, on a 15 class subset of the SUN (Scene UNderstand-ing) dataset. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a systematic and application-oriented approach to training and evaluating named entity recognition and classification (NERC) systems, {{the purpose of}} which is to identify an optimal system and to train an optimal model for named entity tagging DeReKo, a very large general-purpose corpus of contemporary German (Kupietz et al., 2010). DeReKo 's strong dispersion wrt. genre, register and time forces us to base our decision for a specific NERC system on an evaluation performed on a representative sample of DeReKo instead of performance figures that have been reported for the individual NERC systems when evaluated on more uniform and less diverse data. We create and manually annotate such a representative <b>sample</b> as <b>evaluation</b> data for three different NERC systems, for each of which various models are learnt on multiple training data.

40|$|International audienceAutomation and {{advances}} in technology are the key elements in addressing the steadily increasing complexity of Macromolecular Crystallography (MX) experiments. Much of this complexity {{is due to the}} inter-and intra-crystal heterogeneity in diffraction quality often observed for crystals of multi-component macromolecular assemblies or membrane proteins. Such heterogeneity makes high-throughput <b>sample</b> <b>evaluation</b> an important and necessary tool for increasing the chances of a successful structure determination. The introduction at the ESRF of automatic sample changers in 2005 dramatically increased the number of samples that were tested for diffraction quality. This "first generation" of automation, coupled with advances in software aimed at optimising data collection strategies in MX, resulted in a three-fold {{increase in the number of}} crystal structures elucidated per year using data collected at the ESRF.

40|$|Abstract. An {{effective}} optimization method using Kriging {{model and}} parametric <b>sampling</b> <b>evaluation</b> strategy is proposed to solve dynamic optimization design. The optimization {{problem is to}} find the design variables such that the structural weight is minimum and dynamic displacement of the points concerned plus certain side constraints are satisfied. The types of design variables are considered as the sizing variables of the beams and columns. Kriging model is used to build the approximate mapping relationship between the forced vibration amplitude and design variables, reducing expensive dynamic reanalysis. A dynamic analysis program is used as black-box to obtain dynamic response. Numerical examples show that the method has good accuracy and efficiency. Versatility of this method can be expected {{to play an important role}} in future engineering optimization problems...|$|R
