500|$|Daniel Arkin, {{a first-year}} <b>staff</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> show, was {{inspired}} to write the episode based on an incident in his life. In 1991, Arkin had moved into a co-op apartment in Greenwich Village. His movers showed up late, so the crew began unloading around 4 o'clock in the evening.

In the subsequent years, many of Arkin's friends moved from homes and apartments into co-ops, a situation he describes as [...] "kind of frightening." ...|$|E
500|$|Both Margaret Salinger and Maynard {{characterized}} the author as a devoted film buff. According to Margaret, his favorite movies include Gigi (1958), The Lady Vanishes (1938), The 39 Steps (1935; Phoebe's favorite movie in The Catcher in the Rye), and the comedies of W.C. Fields, Laurel and Hardy, and the Marx Bros.. Predating VCRs, Salinger had an extensive collection of classic movies from the 1940s in 16mm prints. Maynard wrote that [...] "he loves movies, not films", and Salinger argued that her father's [...] "worldview is, essentially, {{a product of}} the movies of his day. To my father, all Spanish speakers are Puerto Rican washerwomen, or the toothless, grinning-gypsy types in a Marx Brothers movie". Lillian Ross, a <b>staff</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> New Yorker and longtime friend of Salinger's, wrote following his death, [...] "Salinger loved movies, and he was more fun than anyone to discuss them with. He enjoyed watching actors work, and he enjoyed knowing them. (He loved Anne Bancroft, hated Audrey Hepburn, and said that he had seen Grand Illusion ten times.)" ...|$|E
500|$|Backstage at SNL, Hartman {{was called}} [...] "the Glue", a name coined by Adam Sandler, {{according}} to Jay Mohr's book Gasping for Airtime. However, {{according to a}} biography on Hartman's life entitled You Might Remember Me: The Life and Times of Phil Hartman written by Mike Thomas, author and <b>staff</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Chicago Sun-Times, the nickname was created by SNL cast member and Hartman's frequent on-screen collaborator Jan Hooks. Hartman often helped other cast members. For example, he aided Jan Hooks in overcoming her stage fright. SNL creator Lorne Michaels explained {{the reason for the}} name: [...] "He kind of held the show together. He gave to everybody and demanded very little. He was very low-maintenance." [...] Michaels also added that Hartman was [...] "the least appreciated" [...] cast member by commentators outside the show, and praised his ability [...] "to do five or six parts in a show where you're playing support or you're doing remarkable character work". Hartman won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Program for SNL in 1989, sharing the award with the show's other writers. He was nominated in the same category in 1987, and individually in 1994 for Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program.|$|E

500|$|The writers later {{noted that}} the episode divided fans. Essentially, those who loved it were those who {{realized}} that the writing was intentionally bad {{as a way of}} parodying bad television writing, while others who did not understand this distinction were less enthusiastic. Matt Groening feared that the fans would interpret the episode in a negative light and was uneasy about the episode when it was in production. He later {{went on to say that}} the episode [...] "turned out great". The writers of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood called it, [...] "A very clever spin on the alternates offered by the Treehouse of Horrors run. Each of the spin-offs is very clever in its own way." [...] It has also appeared as one of the favorite episodes on a number of [...] "best of" [...] lists. Entertainment Weekly placed the episode 19th in their top 25 Simpsons episode list. In an interview for Star-News, The Simpsons writer Don Payne revealed that the episode was in his personal top six of the best The Simpsons episodes. Additionally, Gary Mullinax, a <b>staff</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> News Journal, picked the episode as part of his top-ten list.|$|E
500|$|After Fox {{picked up}} the show, it {{acquired}} the working title Chasing Zebras, Circling the Drain ("zebra" [...] is medical slang for an unusual or obscure diagnosis, while [...] "circling the drain" [...] refers to terminal cases, patients in an irreversible decline). The original premise of the show was {{of a team of}} doctors working together trying to [...] "diagnose the undiagnosable". Shore felt it was important to have an interesting central character, one who could examine patients' personal characteristics and diagnose their ailments by figuring out their secrets and lies. As Shore {{and the rest of the}} creative team explored the character's possibilities, the program concept became less of procedure and more focused upon the lead role. The character was named [...] "House", which was adopted as the show's title, as well. Shore developed the characters further and wrote the script for the pilot episode. Bryan Singer, who directed the pilot episode and had a major role in casting the primary roles, has said that the [...] "title of the pilot was 'Everybody Lies', and that's the premise of the show". Shore has said that the central storylines of several early episodes were based on the work of Berton Roueché, a <b>staff</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> New Yorker between 1944 and 1994, who specialized in features about unusual medical cases.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1940s, Salinger had confided {{in a letter}} to Whit Burnett that he was eager to sell the film rights to some of his stories in order to achieve {{financial}} security. According to Ian Hamilton, Salinger was disappointed when [...] "rumblings from Hollywood" [...] over his 1943 short story [...] "The Varioni Brothers" [...] came to nothing. Therefore, he immediately agreed when, in mid-1948, independent film producer Samuel Goldwyn offered to buy the film rights to his short story [...] "Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut". Though Salinger sold his story with the hope—in the words of his agent Dorothy Olding—that it [...] "would make a good movie", the film version of [...] "Wiggily" [...] was lambasted by critics upon its release in 1949. Renamed My Foolish Heart and starring Dana Andrews and Susan Hayward, the melodramatic film departed to such an extent from Salinger's story that Goldwyn biographer A. Scott Berg referred to it as a [...] "bastardization". As a result of this experience, Salinger never again permitted film adaptations to be made from his work. When Brigitte Bardot wanted to buy the rights to [...] "A Perfect Day for Bananafish", Salinger refused the request, but told his friend, Lillian Ross, longtime <b>staff</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> New Yorker, [...] "She's a cute, talented, lost enfante, and I'm tempted to accommodate her, pour le sport." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{episode was}} co-written by Andrew Goldberg and Alex Carter, both having written episodes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> show previously. The episode was {{directed}} by series regular Pete Michels, before {{the conclusion of the}} eighth production season, in his second episode of the season.

5000|$|The {{episode was}} written by series regular Patrick Meighan and {{directed}} by series regular Cyndi Tang, both in their second episode {{during the course of}} the ninth production season.

500|$|The Flukeman—also known affectionately as [...] "Flukey" [...] by {{the cast}} and crew—was portrayed by Darin Morgan, brother of {{executive}} producer Glen Morgan. He would become a <b>staff</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> show later in the second season. The Flukeman suit used by Morgan, which included flipper-like feet, yellow contact lenses, and fake teeth, took six hours to put on; this process was eventually sped up. Morgan wore the suit as much as 20 consecutive hours during shooting. As a result, {{he was forced to}} go to the bathroom while still wearing the suit. Morgan was rarely on set without being in full costume, and recalled that when he met up with David Duchovny again upon joining the series' writing staff, the actor had no idea who he was, despite having enjoyed an amiable relationship with the costumed Morgan previously. The suit dissolved in water, forcing special effects artist Toby Lindala to reconstruct the suit each day. Because the suit did not permit Morgan to breathe through his nose, he was unable to eat while wearing it. Carter described the character as [...] "the embodiment of everyone's sense of vulnerability, the idea of something that exists in the underworld of the sewer system and might in fact come to bite you in the least elegant of places". The original intention was showing even less of the Flukeman, but some angles and lighting ended up revealing more of the creature's design. Carter still felt it helped to [...] "get more creepy", as the Flukeman is not shown fully until the final scenes.|$|E
