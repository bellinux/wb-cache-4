5|$|Cooperativity is {{observed}} when two synapses are activated by weak stimuli incapable of inducing LTP when stimulated individually. But upon simultaneous weak stimulation, both synapses undergo LTP in a cooperative fashion. <b>Synaptic</b> tagging {{does not explain}} how multiple weak stimuli can result in a collective stimulus sufficient to induce LTP (this is explained by the postsynaptic summation of EPSPs described previously). Rather, <b>synaptic</b> tagging explains the ability of weakly stimulated synapses, none of which are capable of independently generating LTP, to receive the products of protein synthesis initiated collectively. As before, this may be accomplished through the synthesis of a local <b>synaptic</b> tag following weak <b>synaptic</b> stimulation.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all animals}} {{are capable of}} modifying their {{behavior}} {{as a result of}} experience—even the most primitive types of worms. Because behavior is driven by brain activity, changes in behavior must somehow correspond to changes inside the brain. Already in the late 19th century theorists like Santiago Ramón y Cajal argued that the most plausible explanation is that learning and memory are expressed as changes in the <b>synaptic</b> connections between neurons. Until 1970, however, experimental evidence to support the <b>synaptic</b> plasticity hypothesis was lacking. In 1971 Tim Bliss and Terje Lømo published a paper on a phenomenon now called long-term potentiation: the paper showed clear evidence of activity-induced <b>synaptic</b> changes that lasted for at least several days. Since then technical advances have made these sorts of experiments much easier to carry out, and thousands of studies have been made that have clarified the mechanism of <b>synaptic</b> change, and uncovered other types of activity-driven <b>synaptic</b> change in a variety of brain areas, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and physical activity appear to play a beneficial role in the process.|$|E
5|$|In neuroscience, {{long-term}} potentiation (LTP) is a persistent strengthening of synapses based on recent patterns of activity. These are patterns of <b>synaptic</b> activity that produce a long-lasting increase in signal transmission between two neurons. The opposite of LTP is long-term depression, which produces a long-lasting decrease in <b>synaptic</b> strength.|$|E
5|$|In normal neuromuscular function, a {{nerve impulse}} is carried down the axon (the long {{projection}} of a nerve cell) from the spinal cord. At the nerve ending in the neuromuscular junction, where the impulse {{is transferred to}} the muscle cell, the nerve impulse leads {{to the opening of}} voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC), the influx of calcium ions into the nerve terminal, and the calcium-dependent triggering of <b>synaptic</b> vesicle fusion with plasma membrane. These <b>synaptic</b> vesicles contain acetylcholine, which is released into the <b>synaptic</b> cleft and stimulates the acetylcholine receptors on the muscle. The muscle then contracts.|$|E
5|$|It is one {{of several}} {{phenomena}} underlying <b>synaptic</b> plasticity, the ability of chemical synapses to change their strength. As memories are thought to be encoded by modification of <b>synaptic</b> strength, LTP is widely considered one of the major cellular mechanisms that underlies learning and memory.|$|E
5|$|Cocaine, {{substituted}} amphetamines (including methamphetamine), Adderall, methylphenidate (marketed as Ritalin or Concerta), MDMA (ecstasy) {{and other}} psychostimulants exert their effects primarily or partly by increasing dopamine {{levels in the}} brain {{by a variety of}} mechanisms. Cocaine and methylphenidate are dopamine transporter blockers or reuptake inhibitors; they non-competitively inhibit dopamine reuptake, resulting in increased dopamine concentrations in the <b>synaptic</b> cleft. Like cocaine, substituted amphetamines and amphetamine also increase the concentration of dopamine in the <b>synaptic</b> cleft, but by different mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|LTP is persistent, lasting {{from several}} minutes to many months, {{and it is}} this {{persistence}} that separates LTP from other forms of <b>synaptic</b> plasticity.|$|E
5|$|On the {{molecular}} level, {{an increase of}} the postsynaptic scaffolding proteins PSD-95 and Homer1c {{has been shown to}} correlate with the stabilization of <b>synaptic</b> enlargement.|$|E
5|$|Other related {{studies have}} also shown {{evidence}} of <b>synaptic</b> alterations and their loss, in the ageing brain. Changes in gene expression alter the levels of proteins in various pathways {{and this has been}} shown to be evident in <b>synaptic</b> contact dysfunction or loss. This dysfunction has been seen to affect many structures of the brain and has a marked effect on inhibitory neurons resulting in a decreased level of neurotransmission, and subsequent cognitive decline and disease.|$|E
5|$|Package {{management}} operations can {{be performed}} with different tools available on Debian, from the lowest level command dpkg to graphical front-ends like <b>Synaptic.</b> The recommended standard for administering packages on a Debian system is the apt toolset.|$|E
5|$|Probably {{the most}} {{familiar}} form of cellular signaling is <b>synaptic</b> transmission, whereby a nerve impulse that has {{reached the end of}} one neuron is conveyed to an adjacent neuron via the release of neurotransmitters. This transmission is made possible by the action of <b>synaptic</b> vesicles loaded with the neurotransmitters to be released. These vesicles fuse with the cell membrane at the pre-synaptic terminal and release its contents to the exterior of the cell. The contents then diffuse across the synapse to the post-synaptic terminal.|$|E
5|$|The {{hippocampus}} {{has been}} seen as central to the pathology of schizophrenia, both in the neural and physiological effects. It has been generally accepted that there is an abnormal <b>synaptic</b> connectivity underlying schizophrenia. Several lines of evidence implicate changes in the <b>synaptic</b> organization and connectivity, in and from the hippocampus Many studies have found dysfunction in the <b>synaptic</b> circuitry within the hippocampus and its activity on the prefrontal cortex. The glutamatergic pathways have been seen to be largely affected. The subfield CA1 is seen to be the least involved of the other subfields, and CA4 and the subiculum have been reported elsewhere as being the most implicated areas. The review concluded that the pathology could be due to genetics, faulty neurodevelopment or abnormal neural plasticity. It was further concluded that schizophrenia is not due to any known neurodegenerative disorder.|$|E
5|$|The {{long-term}} {{stabilization of}} <b>synaptic</b> changes is also {{determined by a}} parallel increase of pre- and postsynaptic structures such as axonal bouton, dendritic spine and postsynaptic density.|$|E
5|$|The perforant path is {{the main}} output pathway of the entorhinal cortex (EC). The flow of {{information}} in the hippocampus is largely unidirectional. Axons from the pyramidal cells (in EC layer II) perforate the subiculum to project mainly to the granular layer in the dentate gyrus (first <b>synaptic</b> connection). Some axons project to CA3 and a lesser number project to CA1. The dentate granule cell axons, called mossy fibers, pass on the information, to the dendrites of CA3 pyramidal cells (second <b>synaptic</b> connection). From there, CA3 axons called Schaffer collaterals leave the deep part of the cell body and loop up to the apical dendrites and then extend to CA1. Axons from CA1 then project back to the entorhinal cortex (third <b>synaptic</b> connection) completing the trisynaptic loop or circuit.|$|E
5|$|The <b>synaptic</b> tag {{hypothesis}} {{may also}} account for LTP's associativity and cooperativity. Associativity (see Properties) is observed when one synapse is excited with LTP-inducing stimulation while a separate synapse is only weakly stimulated. Whereas {{one might expect}} only the strongly stimulated synapse to undergo LTP (since weak stimulation alone is insufficient to induce LTP at either synapse), both synapses will in fact undergo LTP. While weak stimuli are unable to induce protein synthesis in the cell body, they may prompt the synthesis of a <b>synaptic</b> tag. Simultaneous strong stimulation of a separate pathway, capable of inducing cell body protein synthesis, then may prompt the production of plasticity-related proteins, which are shipped cell-wide. With both synapses expressing the <b>synaptic</b> tag, both would capture the protein products resulting in the expression of LTP in both the strongly stimulated and weakly stimulated pathways.|$|E
5|$|Pyridostigmine {{decreases}} {{the degradation of}} acetylcholine after release into the <b>synaptic</b> cleft, and thereby improves muscle contraction. An older agent, guanidine, causes many side effects and is not recommended. 4-Aminopyridine (dalfampridine), an agent related to 3,4-aminopyridine, causes more side effects than 3,4-DAP and is also not recommended.|$|E
5|$|The role of LTP in {{disease is}} less clear than its role in basic {{mechanisms}} of <b>synaptic</b> plasticity. However, alterations in LTP may contribute {{to a number of}} neurological diseases, including depression, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and neuropathic pain. Impaired LTP may also have a role in Alzheimer's disease and drug addiction.|$|E
25|$|Several {{proteins}} of the <b>synaptic</b> ribbon {{have also}} {{been found to be}} associated with conventional synapses. RIM (Rab3-interacting proteins) is a GTPase expressed on <b>synaptic</b> vesicles that is important in priming <b>synaptic</b> vesicles. Immunostaining has revealed the presence of KIF3A, a component of the kinesin II motor complex whose function is still unknown. The presynaptic cytomatrix proteins Bassoon and Piccolo are both expressed at photoreceptor ribbons, but Piccolo is only expressed at retinal bipolar <b>synaptic</b> ribbons. Bassoon is responsible for attaching itself {{to the base of the}} <b>synaptic</b> ribbons and subsequently anchoring the <b>synaptic</b> ribbons. The function of Piccolo is unknown. Also important is the filaments that tether the vesicles to the ribbon synapse. These are shed during high rates of exocytosis. The only unique protein associated with the <b>synaptic</b> ribbon is RIBEYE, first identified in purified <b>synaptic</b> ribbon from bovine retina. It is found to be a part of all vertebrate <b>synaptic</b> ribbons in ribbon synapses and is the central portion of ribbon synapses. RIBEYE interactions are required to form a scaffold formation protein of the <b>synaptic</b> ribbon.|$|E
25|$|Surprisingly, DAT was not {{identified}} within any <b>synaptic</b> active zones. These {{results suggest that}} striatal dopamine reuptake may occur outside of <b>synaptic</b> specializations once dopamine diffuses from the <b>synaptic</b> cleft.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} indicates that glial cells of the hippocampus and cerebellum participate in <b>synaptic</b> transmission, regulate the clearance of neurotransmitters from the <b>synaptic</b> cleft, and release gliotransmitters such as ATP, which modulate <b>synaptic</b> function.|$|E
25|$|In {{correspondence}} to its activity, ribbon synapses can have <b>synaptic</b> ribbons that vary in size. In mouse photoreceptor synapses when the neurotransmitter release rate {{is high and}} exocytosis is high, the <b>synaptic</b> ribbons are long. When neurotransmitter release rate is low and exocytosis is low, the <b>synaptic</b> ribbons are short. A current hypothesis is that <b>synaptic</b> ribbons can enlarge {{by the addition of}} more RIBEYE subunit.|$|E
25|$|Short-term <b>synaptic</b> {{enhancement}} {{results from}} an increased probability of <b>synaptic</b> terminals releasing transmitters {{in response to}} pre-synaptic action potentials. Synapses will strengthen {{for a short time}} because of an increase in the amount of packaged transmitter released in response to each action potential. Depending on the time scales over which it acts <b>synaptic</b> enhancement is classified as neural facilitation, <b>synaptic</b> augmentation or post-tetanic potentiation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Synaptic</b> vesicle {{components}} are initially trafficked to the synapse using {{members of the}} kinesin motor family. In C. elegans the major motor for <b>synaptic</b> vesicles is UNC-104. There is also evidence that other proteins such as UNC-16/Sunday Driver regulate the use of motors for transport of <b>synaptic</b> vesicles.|$|E
25|$|When {{used as a}} rehabilitative intervention, {{particularly}} for respiration and walking, intermittent hypoxia typically works by using long-term facilitation (LTF). LTF, which is synonymous to long-term potentiation, occurs when there are long-term increases in <b>synaptic</b> strength due to <b>synaptic</b> plasticity. In the case of intermittent hypoxia, these increases in <b>synaptic</b> strength result in increased motor output.|$|E
25|$|In a {{chemical}} synapse, {{the process of}} <b>synaptic</b> transmission is as follows: when an action potential reaches the axon terminal, it opens voltage-gated calcium channels, allowing calcium ions to enter the terminal. Calcium causes <b>synaptic</b> vesicles filled with neurotransmitter molecules to fuse with the membrane, releasing their contents into the <b>synaptic</b> cleft. The neurotransmitters diffuse across the <b>synaptic</b> cleft and activate receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. High cytosolic calcium in the axon terminal also triggers mitochondrial calcium uptake, which, in turn, activates mitochondrial energy metabolism to produce ATP to support continuous neurotransmission.|$|E
25|$|The {{modification}} of <b>synaptic</b> strength {{is referred to}} as functional plasticity. Changes in <b>synaptic</b> strength involve distinct mechanisms of particular types of glial cells, the most researched type being astrocytes.|$|E
25|$|Modulation of <b>synaptic</b> transmission: In the supraoptic {{nucleus of}} the hypothalamus, rapid changes in {{astrocyte}} morphology {{have been shown to}} affect heterosynaptic transmission between neurons. In the hippocampus, astrocytes suppress <b>synaptic</b> transmission by releasing ATP, which is hydrolyzed by ectonucleotidases to yield adenosine. Adenosine acts on neuronal adenosine receptors to inhibit <b>synaptic</b> transmission, thereby increasing the dynamic range available for LTP.|$|E
25|$|In full {{collapse}} fusion, the <b>synaptic</b> vesicle merges {{and becomes}} {{incorporated into the}} cell membrane. The formation of the new membrane is a protein mediated process and can only occur under certain conditions. After an action potential, Ca2+ floods to the presynaptic membrane. Ca2+ binds to specific proteins in the cytoplasm, {{one of which is}} synaptotagmin, which in turn trigger the complete fusion of the <b>synaptic</b> vesicle with the cellular membrane. This complete fusion of the pore is assisted by SNARE proteins. This large family of proteins mediate docking of <b>synaptic</b> vesicles in an ATP-dependent manner. With the help of synaptobrevin on the <b>synaptic</b> vesicle, the t-SNARE complex on the membrane, made up of syntaxin and SNAP-25, can dock, prime, and fuse the <b>synaptic</b> vesicle into the membrane.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol's {{ability to}} alter {{behavior}} and decision-making stems from {{its impact on}} <b>synaptic</b> transmission at GABA receptors. Alcohol's effects on the <b>synaptic</b> level dampen the brain's processing ability and limit attentional capacity.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} shown that periods of intense {{stimulation}} at neural synapses deplete vesicle count as well as increase cellular capacitance and surface area. This indicates that after <b>synaptic</b> vesicles release their neurotransmitter payload, they merge with and become part of, the cellular membrane. After tagging <b>synaptic</b> vesicles with HRP (horseradish peroxidase), Heuser and Reese found that portions of the cellular membrane at the frog neuromuscular junction were taken up by the cell and converted back into <b>synaptic</b> vesicles. Studies suggest that the entire cycle of exocytosis, retrieval, and reformation of the <b>synaptic</b> vesicles requires less than 1 minute.|$|E
25|$|Trafficking {{proteins}} {{are more}} complex. They include intrinsic membrane proteins, peripherally bound proteins, and proteins such as SNAREs. These proteins {{do not share}} a characteristic {{that would make them}} identifiable as <b>synaptic</b> vesicle proteins, and little is known about how these proteins are specifically deposited into <b>synaptic</b> vesicles. Many but not all of the known <b>synaptic</b> vesicle proteins interact with non-vesicular proteins and are linked to specific functions.|$|E
25|$|Calcium {{transients}} in spines {{are a key}} {{trigger for}} <b>synaptic</b> plasticity. NMDA receptors, which have a high permeability for calcium, only conduct ions if the membrane potential is suffiently depolarized. The amount of calcium entering a spine during <b>synaptic</b> activity therefore depends on the depolarization of the spine head. Evidence from calcium imaging experiments (two-photon microscopy) and from compartmental modelling indicates that spines with high resistance necks experience larger calcium transients during <b>synaptic</b> activity.|$|E
25|$|The {{photoreceptor}} ribbon synapse {{is around}} 30nm in thickness. It sticks {{out into the}} cytoplasm around 200-1000nm and anchors along its base to the arciform density which is an electron dense structure that is anchored to the presynaptic membrane. The arciform density is located within the <b>synaptic</b> ridge, a small evagination of the presynaptic membrane. Hair cells lack an arciform density so the anchor of this ribbon {{is considered to be}} invisible by electron microscope. The ribbon’s surface has small particles that are around 5nm wide where the <b>synaptic</b> vesicles tether densely via fine protein filaments. There are multiple filaments per vesicle. There are also voltage gated L-type calcium channels on the docking sites of the ribbon synapse which trigger neurotransmitter release. Specifically, ribbon synapses contain specialized organelles called <b>synaptic</b> ribbons, which are large presynaptic structures associated in the active zone. They are thought to fine-tune the <b>synaptic</b> vesicle cycle. <b>Synaptic</b> ribbons are in close proximity to <b>synaptic</b> vesicles, which, in turn, are close to the presynaptic neurotransmitter release site via the ribbon.|$|E
25|$|When {{there is}} {{high-frequency}} NMDA receptor activation, {{there is an}} increase in the expression of a protein PSD-95 that increases <b>synaptic</b> capacity for AMPA receptors. This is what leads to a long-term increase in AMPA receptors and thus <b>synaptic</b> strength and plasticity.|$|E
25|$|In summary, MDMA enters monoamine neurons {{by acting}} as a monoamine {{transporter}} substrate. MDMA activity at VMAT2 moves neurotransmitters out from <b>synaptic</b> vesicles and into the cytosol; MDMA activity at TAAR1 moves neurotransmitters out of the cytosol and into the <b>synaptic</b> cleft.|$|E
25|$|Since {{learning}} and long-term memory {{are believed to}} result from strengthening or weakening the synapses via a mechanism known as <b>synaptic</b> plasticity or <b>synaptic</b> adaptation, the model should include this mechanism. The response of sensory receptors to various stimuli must also be modelled.|$|E
