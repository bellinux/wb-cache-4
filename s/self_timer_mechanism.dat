40|$|End-to-end {{protocols}} measure network {{characteristics and}} react {{based on their}} estimates of network performance. Network dynamics can alter the topology significantly, and thereby affect protocol operation. Topology changes may result in routing pathologies (such as route loops, packet interleaving), changes to the end-to-end path characteristics, network partition etc, that then impact the performance of end-to-end protocols. This paper presents methodologies to evaluate an end-to-end protocol {{in the presence of}} network dynamics using a simulator. A number of models of network dynamics are introduced. In the paper, we evaluate two end-to-end protocols over dynamic topologies and study the adaptivity of these protocols to topology changes. The first part of the paper illustrates the effect of packet interleaving on the performance of TCP. The second part of the paper is a systematic evaluation of the adaptive <b>timer</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in Scalable Reliable Multicast (SRM). The <b>timer</b> <b>mechanisms</b> ar [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Short message {{integrated}} distributed {{monitoring systems}} (SM-DMS) are growing rapidly in wireless communication applications in various areas, such as electromagnetic field (EMF) management, wastewater monitoring, {{and air pollution}} supervision, etc. However, delay in short messages often makes the data embedded in SM-DMS transmit unreliably. Moreover, there are few regulations dealing with this problem in SMS transmission protocols. In this study, based on {{the analysis of the}} command and data requirements in the SM-DMS, we developed a processing model for the control center to solve the delay problem in data transmission. Three components of the model: the data transmission protocol, the receiving buffer pool method, and the <b>timer</b> <b>mechanism</b> were described in detail. Discussions on adjusting the threshold parameter in the <b>timer</b> <b>mechanism</b> were presented for the adaptive performance during the runtime of the SM-DMS. This model optimized the data transmission reliability in SM-DMS, and provided a supplement to the data transmission reliability protocols at the application level.

50|$|The XG-9's {{integrated}} switch for on/off/self-timer/battery {{check was}} removed and its functions {{spread around the}} camera. The <b>self</b> <b>timer</b> was relocated to a switch {{on the front of}} the camera, on the left-hand side of the mirror housing. A new main on-off switch was placed beneath the shutter speed dial. The lock button for the shutter speed dial also functioned as a battery check; the front LED, also used for the self-timer, lit when that button was pressed and the batteries held adequate charge. Film speed and exposure compensation settings were moved to beneath the rewind knob.|$|R

While it is important to ensure that all nodes get a copy of the broadcast message, minimizing the number of sending nodes is equally important especially in resource-constrained wireless networks. Existing broadcasting protocols based on self-pruning are ineffective in achieving these objectives. Therefore this paper proposes two protocols based on simple <b>timer</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to prioritize broadcasting of messages such that node with most uncovered neighbors rebroadcast first. Additionally a <b>timer</b> suppression <b>mechanism</b> is proposed to further enhance the effectiveness of the broadcasting protocol. Compared with an existing protocol, extensive simulation experiments confirm that the proposed protocols achieve better performance. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|WSNs (Wireless Sensor Networks) {{can collect}} {{reliable}} and accurate information in distant and hazardous environments, {{and can be}} used in National Defence, Military Affairs, Industrial Control, Environmental Monitor, Traffic Management, Medical Care, Smart Home, etc. The sensor whose resources are limited is cheap, and depends on battery to supply electricity, so it’s important for routing to efficiently utilize its power. In this paper, an energy-efficient Single-Hop Active Clustering (SHAC) algorithm is proposed for wireless sensor networks. The core of SHAC has three parts. Firstly, a <b>timer</b> <b>mechanism</b> is introduced to select tentative cluster-heads. By analyzing relation between time of timer and residual energy, it is known that time of timer is inversely proportional to residual energy of nodes so a <b>timer</b> <b>mechanism</b> can balance the residual energy of the whole network nodes which improves the network energy efficiency. Secondly, a cost function is proposed to balance energy-efficient of each node. Finally, an active clustering algorithm is proposed for single-hop homogeneous networks. Through both theoretical analysis and numerical results, it is shown that SHAC prolongs the network lifetime significantly against the other clustering protocols such as LEACH-C and EECS. Under general instance, SHAC may prolong the lifetime by up to 50 % against EECS...|$|R

We first distinguish between intra- and inter-class fairness {{as a result of}} hierarchical resource access right in a secondary spectrum allocation regime. Further, we develop a <b>timer</b> <b>mechanism</b> to achieve round-robin, max-min and proportional fairness for intra-class scheduling in a CRN. The case of inter-class fairness is a addressed by defining a time bias to prioritize the resource access of primary links. Numerical results show that proportional fair scheduling sustains a good level of performance for both intra and inter-class fairness...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{real-time}} systems {{consist of}} a combination of hard real-time, firm real-time and soft real-time tasks. Hard real-time (HRT) tasks mandate strict timing requirements by requiring that a static timing analysis can be performed to compute a worst-case latency (WCL) bound. Firm real-time (FRT) and soft real-time (SRT) tasks, on the other hand, do not impose such stringent requirements. Instead, they tolerate infrequent violations of deadlines in favour of improved average-case performance. When deploying such a system on a multi-core platform, the hardware resources such as the main memory, caches and shared bus are shared between the tasks. This results in interference by FRT or SRT tasks on HRT tasks, which complicates the timing analysis for HRT tasks, and potentially yields unbounded WCL. This thesis presents a time-based cache coherence protocol, HourGlass, to predictably share data in a multi-core system across different criticality tasks. HourGlass is derived from the conventional Modified Shared Invalid (MSI) cache coherence protocol, and it is equipped with a <b>timer</b> <b>mechanism</b> that allows the cores to hold a valid copy of data in its private cache for certain duration. HourGlass is designed to ensure WCL bounds for HRT tasks, and it also provides performance improvements for FRT and SRT tasks. Such a coherence protocol encourages a trade-off between the WCL bounds for hard real-time tasks, and performance offered to firm or soft real-time tasks with the help of <b>timer</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> HourGlass was prototyped in gem 5, a micro-architectural simulator, and evaluated with multi-threaded benchmarks...|$|R
30|$|In TCP, a {{retransmission}} <b>timer</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{is adopted}} to ensure reliable delivery of data. The retransmission time-out value is dynamically determined by estimating the RTT {{samples of the}} connection. Under the above circumstances, when a delay spike occurs the sender may not receive an acknowledgment within the time-out period and, thus, the sender will regard all the transmitted but not acknowledged packets as lost. Consequently, the sender will unnecessarily reduce the sending rate and aggressively retransmit those packets that are deemed lost but are merely delayed. Meanwhile, TCP will exponentially increase the retransmission time-out value, {{which leads to a}} long waiting time period if congestion loss takes place and, thus, wastes the limited available bandwidth.|$|R

If efficiently re-established after chromosome duplication, histone modifications could help propagate gene expression patterns in dividing cells by epigenetic mechanisms. We used an integrated approach to investigate the dynamics of the conserved methylation of histone H 3 Lys 79 (H 3 K 79) by Dot 1. Our results show that methylation of H 3 K 79 progressively changes after histone deposition, which is incompatible with a rapid copy mechanism. Instead, methylation accumulates on ageing histones, providing the cell with a <b>timer</b> <b>mechanism</b> to directly couple cell-cycle length to changes in chromatin modification on the nucleosome core. © 2011 European Molecular Biology Organization...|$|R

Computer-related failure can be defined as any event that causes a computer-based medical device to function improperly or present harm to patients or users due to failures in any of the medical systems components including software, hardware, I/O, or battery. Most computer failures are software failures (Alemzadeh et al. 2013). To address software failure in our system, we used watchdog <b>timer</b> <b>mechanism</b> to monitor if the system hangs or does not respond for a specific period of time because of any software failure. For example, if the system hangs for more than one minute, the watchdog timer will restart the system. Moreover, if there is a hardware failure, an alarm message will be displayed to notify the user.|$|R
