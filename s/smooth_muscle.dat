5|$|The muscle of the {{esophagus}} in many mammals is striated initially, but then becomes <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> in the caudal third or so. In canines and ruminants, however, {{it is entirely}} striated to allow regurgitation to feed young (canines) or regurgitation to chew cud (ruminants). It is entirely <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> in amphibians, reptiles and birds.|$|E
5|$|Muscle cells (myocytes) {{form the}} active {{contractile}} tissue of the body. Muscle tissue functions to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs. Muscle is formed of contractile filaments and is separated into three main types; <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle,</b> skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. <b>Smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> has no striations when examined microscopically. It contracts slowly but maintains contractibility {{over a wide}} range of stretch lengths. It is found in such organs as sea anemone tentacles and the body wall of sea cucumbers. Skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension. It is found in the movement of appendages and jaws. Obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two. The filaments are staggered and {{this is the type of}} muscle found in earthworms that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions. In higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets. <b>Smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> is found in the walls of the uterus, bladder, intestines, stomach, oesophagus, respiratory airways, and blood vessels. Cardiac muscle is found only in the heart, allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body.|$|E

50|$|<b>Smooth</b> <b>muscles</b> are {{controlled}} {{directly by the}} autonomic nervous system and are involuntary, meaning that they are incapable of being moved by conscious thought.

5|$|Myosin {{regulatory}} {{light chain}} 2, ventricular/cardiac muscle isoform (MLC-2) {{also known as}} the regulatory light chain of myosin (RLC) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the MYL2 gene. This cardiac ventricular RLC isoform is distinct from that expressed in skeletal muscle (MYLPF), <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> (MYL12B) and cardiac atrial muscle (MYL7).|$|E
5|$|Some sources {{state that}} in {{contrast}} to the glans penis, the clitoral glans lacks <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> within its fibrovascular cap and is thus differentiated from the erectile tissues of the clitoris and bulbs; additionally, bulb size varies and may be dependent on age and estrogenization. Though the bulbs are considered the equivalent of the male spongiosum, they do not completely encircle the urethra.|$|E
5|$|The central adrenomedullary vein, in the adrenal medulla, is {{an unusual}} type of blood vessel. Its {{structure}} {{is different from the}} other veins in that the <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> in its tunica media (the middle layer of the vessel) is arranged in conspicuous, longitudinally oriented bundles.|$|E

50|$|There are {{at least}} four known endothelin receptors, ETA, ETB1, ETB2 and ETC, {{all of which are}} G protein-coupled receptors whose {{activation}} result in elevation of intracellular-free calcium, which constricts the <b>smooth</b> <b>muscles</b> of the blood vessels, raising blood pressure, or relaxes the <b>smooth</b> <b>muscles</b> of the blood vessels, lowering blood pressure, among other functions.|$|R

5|$|The {{ligament}} {{contains a}} slender band of skeletal muscle from the diaphragm and a fibromuscular band of <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> from the horizontal and ascending {{parts of the}} duodenum. When it contracts, by virtue of connections to {{the third and fourth}} parts of the duodenum, the suspensory muscle of the duodenum widens the angle of the duodenojejunal flexure, allowing movement of the intestinal contents.|$|E
5|$|The muscular {{layer of}} the {{esophagus}} has two types of muscle. The upper third of the esophagus contains striated muscle, the lower third contains <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle,</b> and the middle third contains a mixture of both. Muscle is arranged in two layers: {{one in which the}} muscle fibers run longitudinal to the esophagus, and the other in which the fibers encircle the esophagus. These are separated by the myenteric plexus, a tangled network of nerve fibers involved in the secretion of mucus and in peristalsis of the <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> of the esophagus. The outermost {{layer of the}} esophagus is the adventitia in most of its length, with the abdominal part being covered in serosa. This makes it distinct from many other structures in the gastrointestinal tract that only have a serosa.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} a {{medicinal}} enzyme inhibitor is sildenafil (Viagra), a common treatment for male erectile dysfunction. This compound is a potent inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5, the enzyme that degrades the signalling molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate. This signalling molecule triggers <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> relaxation and allows blood flow into the corpus cavernosum, which causes an erection. Since the drug decreases {{the activity of the}} enzyme that halts the signal, it makes this signal last {{for a longer period of}} time.|$|E

5|$|The lungs are {{supplied}} by nerves of the autonomic nervous system. Input from the {{parasympathetic nervous system}} occurs via the vagus nerve. When stimulated by acetylcholine, this causes constriction of the <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> lining the bronchus and bronchioles, and increases the secretions from glands. The lungs also have a sympathetic tone from norepinephrine acting on the beta 2 receptors in the respiratory tract, which causes bronchodilation.|$|E
5|$|The {{secretory}} {{phase is}} {{the final phase of}} the uterine cycle and it corresponds to the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle. During the secretory phase, the corpus luteum produces progesterone, which plays a vital role in making the endometrium receptive to implantation of the blastocyst and supportive of the early pregnancy, by increasing blood flow and uterine secretions and reducing the contractility of the <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> in the uterus; it also has the side effect of raising the woman's basal body temperature.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the lower}} {{respiratory}} tract including the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles is lined with respiratory epithelium. This is a ciliated epithelium interspersed with goblet cells which produce mucus, and club cells with actions similar to macrophages. Incomplete rings of cartilage in the trachea and smaller plates of cartilage in the bronchi, keep these airways open. Bronchioles are too narrow to support cartilage and their walls are of <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle,</b> and this is largely absent in the narrower respiratory bronchioles which are mainly just of epithelium. The respiratory tract ends in lobules. Each lobule consists of a respiratory bronchiole, which branches into alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs, which in turn divide into alveoli.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are three}} types of muscles - cardiac, skeletal, and <b>smooth.</b> <b>Smooth</b> <b>muscles</b> are used to control the flow of {{substances}} within the lumens of hollow organs, and are not consciously controlled. Skeletal and cardiac muscles have striations that are visible under a microscope due to the components within their cells. Only skeletal and <b>smooth</b> <b>muscles</b> {{are part of the}} musculoskeletal system and only the skeletal muscles can move the body. Cardiac muscles are found in the heart and are used only to circulate blood; like the <b>smooth</b> <b>muscles,</b> these muscles are not under conscious control. Skeletal muscles are attached to bones and arranged in opposing groups around joints. [...] Muscles are innervated, to communicate nervous energy to, by nerves, which conduct electrical currents from the central nervous system and cause the muscles to contract.|$|R

5|$|Telangiectasias and {{arteriovenous}} malformations in HHT {{are thought}} to arise because of changes in angiogenesis, the development of blood vessels out of existing ones. The {{development of a new}} blood vessel requires the activation and migration of various types of cells, chiefly endothelium, <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> and pericytes. The exact mechanism by which the HHT mutations influence this process is not yet clear, and it is likely that they disrupt a balance between pro- and antiangiogenic signals in blood vessels. The wall of telangiectasias is unusually friable, which explains the tendency of these lesions to bleed.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of calcium}} channel blockers, {{thought to be}} able to prevent the spasm of blood vessels by {{preventing}} calcium from entering <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> cells, has been proposed for prevention. The calcium channel blocker nimodipine when taken by mouth improves outcome if given between the fourth and twenty-first day after the bleeding, even if it does not reduce the amount of vasospasm detected on angiography. In traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, nimodipine does not affect long-term outcome, and is not recommended. Other calcium channel blockers and magnesium sulfate have been studied, but are not presently recommended; neither is there any evidence that shows benefit if nimodipine is given intravenously.|$|E

Laboratory experiments showed it increased tone of guinea pig <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> of the small bowel (ileum), and that when given to rats, it led to mydriasis, skeletal muscle weakness, and central nervous system depression. Turbinellus floccosus contains more than double the amount of this acid than the related T. kauffmanii.|$|E

25|$|MiR-1 has {{key roles}} in the {{development}} and differentiation of smooth and skeletal muscles. For example, in the lineage-specific differention of <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> cells from embroyonic stem cell derived cultures, MiR-1 is required; as its loss of function resulted in a reduction in <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> cell biomarkers and a reduction in the derived <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> cell population. There is evidence that the control of <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> cell differentiation by MiR-1 may be mediated by the down regulation of Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), since a MiR-1 recognition site is predicted in the 3' UTR of KLF4 and inhibition of MiR-1 results in reversed down-regulation of KLF4 and an inhibition of <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> cell differentiation. A mutation in the 3' UTR of the myostatin gene in Texel sheep creates a miR-1 and miR-206 target site. This is likely to cause the muscular phenotype of this breed of sheep.|$|E
