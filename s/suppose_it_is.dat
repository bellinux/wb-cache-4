25|$|In the Bayesian (or epistemological) interpretation, {{probability}} measures a “degree of belief.” Bayes’ theorem then {{links the}} degree of belief in a proposition before and after accounting for evidence. For example, <b>suppose</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> believed with 50% certainty that a coin is {{twice as likely to}} land heads than tails. If the coin is flipped a number of times and the outcomes observed, that degree of belief may rise, fall or remain the same depending on the results.|$|E
25|$|Kempe {{also showed}} {{correctly}} that G {{can have no}} vertex of degree 4. As before we remove the vertex v and four-color the remaining vertices. If all four neighbors of v are different colors, say red, green, blue, and yellow in clockwise order, we look for an alternating path of vertices colored red and blue joining the red and blue neighbors. Such a path is called a Kempe chain. There may be a Kempe chain joining the red and blue neighbors, {{and there may be}} a Kempe chain joining the green and yellow neighbors, but not both, since these two paths would necessarily intersect, and the vertex where they intersect cannot be colored. <b>Suppose</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the red and blue neighbors that are not chained together. Explore all vertices attached to the red neighbor by red-blue alternating paths, and then reverse the colors red and blue on all these vertices. The result is still a valid four-coloring, and v can now be added back and colored red.|$|E

The painting was not commissioned by her and he pursued her for the opportunity, quite unlike most of his portrait work where clients sought him out. Sargent wrote to a mutual acquaintance: ...|$|E
2500|$|The science {{revolution}} {{attributed to}} Thales began gaining political force, and this play offered {{a warning to}} the new thinkers. Kitto interprets the play as Sophocles' retort to the sophists, by dramatizing {{a situation in which}} humans face undeserved suffering through no fault of their own, but despite the apparent randomness of the events, {{the fact that they have}} been prophesied by the gods implies that the events are not random, despite the reasons being beyond human comprehension. Through the play, according to Kitto, Sophocles declares [...] "that it is wrong, in the face of the incomprehensible and unmoral, to deny the moral laws and accept chaos. What is right is to recognize facts and not delude ourselves. The universe is a unity; if, sometimes, we can see neither rhyme nor reason in it we should not <b>suppose</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> random.
