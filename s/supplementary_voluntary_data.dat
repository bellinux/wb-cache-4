40|$|Abstract: There {{has been}} {{enormous}} progress in geospatial data acquisition {{in the last}} decade. Centralized data collection, mainly by land surveying offices and local government agencies, has changed dramatically to <b>voluntary</b> <b>data</b> provision by citizens. Among a broad list of initiatives dealing with user generated geospatial information, OpenStreetMap (OSM) {{is one of the}} most famous crowd-sourced products. It is believed that the quality of collected information remains a valid concern. Therefore, qualitative assessment of OSM data as the most significant instance of volunteered geospatial information (VGI) is a considerable issue in the geospatial information community. One aspect of VGI quality assessment pertains to its comparison with institutionally referenced geospatial databases. This paper proposes a new quality metric for assessment of VGI accuracy and as well as for quality analysis of OSM dataset by evaluating its consistency with that of a reference map produced by Municipality of Tehran, Iran. A gridded map is employed and heuristic metrics such as Minimum Bounding Geometry area and directional distribution (Standard Deviational Ellipse), evaluated for both VGI and referenced data, are separately compared in each grid. Finally, in order to have a specific output as an integrated quality metric fo...|$|R

This paper presents an in-depth {{statistical analysis of}} risk-adjusted mortality of ICU admissions from 2000 to 2010 {{for the purpose of}} identifying ICUs with unusual performance. Methods: A cohort of 523, 462 patients from 144 ICUs was analysed. For each ICU, the natural logarithm of the standardised mortality ratio (log-SMR) was estimated from a risk-adjusted, three-level hierarchical model. This is the first time a three-level model has been fitted to such a large ICU database anywhere. The analysis was conducted in three stages which included the estimation of a null distribution to describe usual ICU performance. Log-SMRs with appropriate estimates of standard errors are presented in a funnel plot using 5 % false discovery rate thresholds. False coverage-statement rate confidence intervals are also presented. The observed numbers of deaths for ICUs identified as unusual are compared to the predicted true worst numbers of deaths under the model for usual ICU performance. Results: Seven ICUs were identified as performing unusually over the period 2000 to 2010, in particular, demonstrating high risk-adjusted mortality compared to the majority of ICUs.
