5|$|The last <b>squeaky</b> {{wheel in}} the City Council had been greased. The last {{independent}} voice {{had joined the}} chorus...Shiller's endorsement of Daley {{is all the more}} amazing when you look at where she started, about as close to a Marxist as you'd ever find at City Hall.|$|E
5|$|Colley Cibber was {{a rather}} {{unsuccessful}} young actor {{at the time of}} the split, with a <b>squeaky</b> voice and without any of the physical attractiveness of the soon-to-be-dead Horden. After the success of Love's Last Shift, his status was transformed, with both companies vying for his services as actor and playwright. He made an off-season transfer to Betterton's company in the summer of 1696 and wrote part of a play for the rebels before being re-seduced by Rich by means of a fat contract (Milhous). Cibber as Lord Foppington was thus also assured, and finally the première of The Relapse could be scheduled with some confidence. Cibber's performance in it was received with even greater acclaim than in his own play, Vanbrugh's Lord Foppington being a larger and, in the estimation of both contemporaries and modern critics, much funnier part than Sir Novelty Fashion. Vanbrugh's play incorporates some of the ad-libbing and affectations of Cibber's by all accounts inspired performance in Love's Last Shift. Cibber has thus imprinted not only his own playwriting but also his acting style and <b>squeaky</b> personality on Vanbrugh's best-known character.|$|E
5|$|Like other nuthatches, {{this is a}} noisy {{species with}} a range of vocalizations. The male's mating song is a rapid nasal qui-qui-qui-qui-qui-qui-qui. The contact call between members of a pair, given most {{frequently}} in the fall and winter is a thin <b>squeaky</b> nit, uttered up to 30 times a minute. A more distinctive sound is a shrill kri repeated rapidly with mounting anxiety or excitement kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri; the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin subspecies have a higher, faster yididitititit call, and Pacific birds a more nasal beeerf.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Spaceman tells Tracy {{that he is}} dating <b>Squeaky</b> Fromme {{and says}} {{that she is a}} handful. Fromme {{is a member of the}} Manson Family, and was sentenced to life {{imprisonment}} for attempting to assassinate United States President Gerald Ford in 1975. Jenna and Danny begin arguing after the two are forced to share a dressing room. She takes down Danny's poster of the Montreal Alouettes, a Canadian Football League team based in Montreal, Quebec, which was signed by Marc Trestman, the head coach of the Alouettes. Jenna says that she took down the poster because it was tacky, as are his mother's chain e-mails (a message that attempts to induce the recipient to make a number of copies of the letter and then pass them on to as many recipients as possible).|$|E
5|$|Woody {{prepares to}} go to cowboy camp with Andy, but during a brief play-time, Woody's right arm is accidentally torn. Andy's mom puts Woody on a shelf, and Andy leaves without Woody. The next day, Woody finds that Wheezy, a penguin <b>squeaky</b> toy, has been shelved for months due to a broken squeaker. Andy's mother puts Wheezy in a yard sale, but Woody rescues him, only to be stolen by a greedy toy collector, who takes him to his apartment. Buzz Lightyear {{and the rest of}} Andy's toys {{identify}} the thief from a commercial to be Al McWhiggin, the owner of a toy store called Al's Toy Barn. Buzz, Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, and Rex set out to rescue Woody.|$|E
5|$|Toy Storys {{script was}} {{strongly}} influenced by the ideas of screenwriter Robert McKee. The members of Pixar's story team—Lasseter, Stanton, Docter and Joe Ranft—were aware {{that most of them}} were beginners at writing for feature films. None of them had any feature story or writing credits to their name besides Ranft, who had taught a story class at CalArts and did some storyboard work prior. Seeking insight, Lasseter and Docter attended a three-day seminar in Los Angeles given by McKee. His principles, grounded in Aristotle's Poetics, dictated that a character emerges most realistically and compellingly from the choices that the protagonist makes in reaction to his problems. Disney also appointed Joel Cohen, Alec Sokolow and, later, Joss Whedon to help develop the script. Whedon found that the script wasn't working but had a great structure, and added the character of Rex and sought a pivotal role for Barbie. The story team continued to touch up the script as production was underway. Among the late additions was the encounter between Buzz and the alien <b>squeaky</b> toys at Pizza Planet, which emerged from a brainstorming session with a dozen directors, story artists, and animators from Disney.|$|E
5|$|Western jackdaws are voluble birds. The main call, {{frequently}} {{given in}} flight, is a metallic and <b>squeaky</b> chyak-chyak or kak-kak. This is a contact or greeting call. A feeding call made by adults to call young, or males when offering food to their mates, has been transcribed as kiaw or kyow. Females in return give a more drawn out version when begging for food from males, written as kyaay, tchaayk or giaaaa. Perched birds often chatter together, and before settling for the night, large roosting flocks make a cackling noise. Western jackdaws {{also have a}} hoarse, drawn-out alarm call, arrrrr or kaaaarr, used when warning of predators or when mobbing them. Nestlings begin making a soft cheep at about a week of age. As they grow, their voice becomes louder until their call is a penetrating screech around day 18. After this, the voice deepens and softens. From day 25, the young cease calling and become silent if they hear an unfamiliar noise. The European jackdaw can be trained to imitate human speech.|$|E

25|$|Inside the Bungalow {{was a large}} purple cupboard, {{and once}} or twice during each show, away from the {{attention}} of Dick, Dom and the Bungalow Heads, the cupboard doors would open to show the adventures of Diddy Dick and Dom. These were short pre-recorded sketches, {{no more than a}} minute in length, with Dick and Dom donning black clothes and attaching a small puppet's body around their necks. Both Diddy Dick and Diddy Dom spoke with very <b>squeaky</b> voices, edited in post production.|$|E
25|$|Buffalo {{is home to}} over 50 {{private and}} public art galleries, most notably the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, home to a {{collection}} of modern and contemporary art, and the Burchfield-Penney Art Center. In 2012, AmericanStyle ranked Buffalo twenty-fifth in its list of top mid-sized cities for art.

25|$|Thomas A. Edison {{had invented}} the {{phonograph}} in 1877. But the fame bestowed on Edison for this invention (sometimes called his most original) was {{not due to}} its quality. Recording with his tinfoil phonograph was too difficult to be practical, as the tinfoil tore easily, and even when the stylus was properly adjusted, its reproduction of sound was distorted and <b>squeaky,</b> and good {{for only a few}} playbacks; nevertheless Edison had discovered the secret of sound recording. However he did not work to improve its quality, likely because of an agreement to spend the next five years developing the New York City electric light and power system.|$|E
25|$|The {{breeding}} season {{begins with the}} rains. The male sings from a high perch and also performs aerobatic manoeuvers with rising and falling before diving with song notes. The song is a <b>squeaky</b> series of calls: chiwee-chiwee-chiwi-chip-chip-chip (or yousee-yousee-yousee-which-which-which-which). The nest is a cup of grass placed between leaves that are sewn together with cobwebs and resembles the nest of a common tailorbird but tends to be placed closer to the ground. The typical clutch consists {{of three or four}} eggs. The eggs vary in colour and they include glossy blue, pinkish white, greenish-blue or even pure white. They usually have reddish brown speckles at the broad end. Both parents incubate the eggs which hatch after about ten to eleven days. More than one brood may be raised in a season.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s, American author Joan Didion auditioned in {{the hotel}} for a Pasadena Playhouse theater part at a casting call and Pulitzer Prize-winning dramatist and author William Saroyan frequented the hotel bar.

25|$|In 2000 Suzuki's career came to {{an abrupt}} halt when Eiji Yamada, the President of her {{production}} company AG Communication, was convicted on tax evasion charges. AG Communication had evaded tax by under-reporting their earnings, and by consequence were underpaying royalties to artists. Suzuki's parents Tadao and Miyako Suzuki sued AG Communication for termination of her contract on these grounds, and that the association would taint her <b>squeaky</b> clean image. They attempted to set up a subsidiary called Music Tribe to solve the problem. The Tokyo District Court found in her favor, but the lawsuit resulted in Ami Suzuki's blacklisting because of an unwritten rule of the entertainment business in Japan: artists who get into legal disputes with their agents are blacklisted. In court documents, it was revealed that AG Communication had paid her very little to begin with: despite eight-figure record sales that year, Suzuki earned just $1500 a month at the start of her career, and a minuscule 0.4% royalty rate on CDs, raised to $9780 and 0.55% in 1999.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, {{she was in}} Los Angeles to {{audition}} for {{a role in the}} film , a fact that she revealed at the UK premiere of the film on 24 March 2004 in London. She got the role and three days after leaving S Club, she began filming. In March 2004, Spearritt successfully auditioned for a minor role in the horror film Seed of Chucky, which was seen by some as an attempt to distance herself from her <b>squeaky</b> clean S Club image. Shortly after completing filming, Spearritt decided to take a break from show-business to travel and spend time with her family. In early November 2005, she made her acting comeback in the BBC's Blessed, an eight-part sitcom. In Blessed, she played a minor role, appearing {{as a member of a}} fake girl band in two episodes. December 2005 saw Spearritt appearing in the unsuccessful West End musical, Snow! The Musical, at London's Sound Theatre. The musical was cancelled just three weeks into its run because of poor ticket sales - one show managed to attract an audience of only two people.|$|E

The album's closing track, [...] "Slow Jam", which Pitchfork reviewer Andy Beta said [...] "has that long goodbye of the best melancholy closers," [...] was described by Begrand as a [...] "warm, wide-eyed, watching-the-sun-rise song" [...] that features chiming guitars and a sample of a child's <b>squeaky</b> toy.|$|E
500|$|Leonard Nimoy {{tells the}} viewers goodnight. He is then {{reminded}} {{that the show}} still has ten minutes left by an off-screen <b>Squeaky</b> Voiced Teen, at which point he runs to his car and leaves. The <b>Squeaky</b> Voiced Teen takes over the narrating duties. Following the successful capture of the alien's existence, Homer and Bart present it to the media. Everyone in town finally believes Homer, though Lisa maintains {{that there must be}} a logical explanation. Friday comes again and everyone goes to the forest. The alien appears, promising love, but the townspeople begin to riot, and charge at the alien. Lisa and Waylon Smithers stop them just in time, showing that the [...] "alien" [...] is actually Mr. Burns. Smithers explains that Burns receives longevity treatment once a week in order to cheat death; this leaves him disoriented, as well as giving him a soft, high pitched voice {{as a result of a}} vocal cord scraping. Back to his normal self, Burns reveals that his green glow is due to many years of working in his nuclear plant, before receiving another booster injection from Dr. Nick. He reverts to his [...] "alien" [...] self; he begins to sing [...] "Good Morning Starshine", with the entire crowd [...] joining in. Squeaky-voiced Teen closes the episode by telling the viewers to watch the skies.|$|E

She has a <b>squeaky</b> voice that begins to grate on you; when she cries, {{you can see the}} onions in her eyes."

The initial trill is described as rising and then falling, and the last trill is described as long. Birds may sometimes vary the pattern and only use part of the song. The species is also described as making a <b>squeaky</b> and undulating screech, and males are described as whistling on the nest. Foraging males have been observed making an ascending [...] "shreee" [...] every few seconds while hunting for insects.|$|E
500|$|More {{mixed reviews}} were {{critical}} of Diamandis' vocal delivery. Lou Thomas from BBC Music commented that [...] "he consistently diverting changes in style across the album are fine—the wonky 80s shoulder-pad pop of 'The Outsider' {{is nothing like}} anything else here, for example. But over 13 songs of Sparks-voice and many similar staccato piano riffs listeners may feel bludgeoned by Marina and her slightly overbearing presence", concluding that her eccentric vocals would polarise opinions. Sean O'Neal wrote on The A.V. Club that after [...] "dozens of <b>squeaky</b> Regina Spektor-ish enunciations" [...] and [...] "Kate Bush trills", the [...] "overbearing need to prove herself just ends up being exhausting". Joe Rivers of No Ripcord praised [...] "Are You Satisfied?", [...] "Hollywood" [...] and [...] "Oh No!" [...] but was put off by sudden [...] "howling" [...] in [...] "Hermit the Frog" [...] and a [...] "throaty growl" [...] in [...] "The Outsider".|$|E
500|$|Critics praised I Not Stupid Too for its {{touching}} {{portrayal of}} the problems faced by Singaporean teenagers. According to a review in the South China Morning Post, the movie [...] "presents a candid portrait of Singaporean society at odds with its stereotypically <b>squeaky</b> clean image". Nie Peng of Shenzhen Daily felt the film [...] "captured the emotional depth and effectively conveyed the underlying theme of generation gaps", while movieXclusive.com reviewer Jolene Tan called it [...] "a good local movie that will have [...] laughing in stitches and crying at certain points". However, I Not Stupid Too was also panned for being overly preachy: a reviewer for The Hindu said that the movie [...] "feels like a public service program written by Singapore's social welfare department". Geoffrey Eu, a reviewer for The Business Times, commented that it [...] "takes the line that the viewer needs to be clubbed into submission rather than persuaded via a more subtle line of reasoning".|$|E
500|$|Glee costume {{designer}} Lou Eyrich described Rachel's costuming {{in an interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Originally, the inspiration for her look was Tracy Flick from Election—very buttoned-down, preppy, obnoxious, <b>squeaky</b> clean, nerdy. But she's got at least 12 costume changes each episode. That same look all the time just gets boring for the screen and for the actress to wear, so we spread it out a lot. We try to have her buttoned-up or wearing a nerdy sweater over a cute dress, like she doesn't quite get it right. Or she takes that sweater and tucks it into the skirt and pairs it with knee highs and flats. She makes it her way, which is more quirky. The popular girls {{find a way to make}} it look cool, but Rachel makes it look nerdy. But it's not old-school nerdy with thick glasses and pocket protectors. She thinks she's taking a trend and making it cool, but she wears it wrong." ...|$|E
500|$|Hot Press {{called it}} an [...] "obligatory ballad" [...] which portrays Jackon's musicality, {{showcasing}} her [...] "versatility and mastery of a bewildering array of styles." [...] Spence D. of IGN praised the single, calling it [...] "'70s retro mode" [...] and a perfect homage to the era of mainstream excess. The review added, [...] "It's <b>squeaky</b> and clean sounding in a sugary, fluff kind of way, {{almost as if it}} were a song recorded by Janet years ago and recently rediscovered. And you know what? It's cool because of that." [...] Aaron Foley of MLive considered it Jackson's fourth most underrated single, calling it among [...] "the fruits from that era that don't get the respect they deserve". Foley added, that after Jackson's Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy, [...] "I Want You" [...] "got lost in the wash. The starry-eyed, Motown-inspired ballad had Janet vulnerable and lovesick, boo hooing for her lover's attention." ...|$|E
500|$|Bob the Sponge is the comic's [...] "announcer". He resembles {{an actual}} sea sponge, {{and at first}} Hillenburg {{continued}} this design because it [...] "was the correct thing to do biologically as a marine-science teacher." [...] In determining the new character's personality, he drew inspiration from innocent, childlike figures that he enjoyed, such as Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, Jerry Lewis, and Pee-wee Herman. He then considered modeling the character after a kitchen sponge, and realized that this idea would match the character's square personality perfectly: [...] "t looked so funny. I think as far as cartoon language goes he was easier to recognize. He seemed to fit the character type I was looking fora somewhat nerdy, <b>squeaky</b> clean [...]" [...] To voice the central character of the series, Hillenburg turned to Tom Kenny, whose career in animation had started alongside Hillenburg's on Rocko's Modern Life. Elements of Kenny's own personality were employed in further developing the character.|$|E
500|$|Series co-creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk {{began working}} on American Horror Story before their Fox series Glee began production. Murphy {{wanted to do the}} {{opposite}} of what he'd done previously and thus began his work on the series. He stated, [...] "We're doing some <b>squeaky</b> clean, sweet, optimistic, non-cynical piece, I wanted to do something that sorta tapped into the different side of my personality." [...] Falchuk was intrigued by the idea of putting a different angle on the horror genre, stating that their main goal in creating the series was to scare viewers. He said, [...] "You want people {{to be a little bit}} off balance afterwards." [...] The dark tone of the series was influenced by the 1970s ABC soap opera Dark Shadows, which Murphy's grandmother forced him to watch when he was younger to toughen him up. In addition, the series draws inspiration from classic horror films such as Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby and Stanley Kubrick's The Shining.|$|E
500|$|Howard Stern {{played the}} sound {{on his radio}} show several times, {{including}} when Shatner appeared on the show to promote his upcoming television series Iron Chef USA on November 13, 2001. When Stern asked about the sound, Shatner said it had been produced by the boom operator. A similar claim was made on Shatner's website, where the noise was attributed to a <b>squeaky</b> jib. On Conan O'Brien's Late Night program on November 14, Shatner called it [...] "outrageous" [...] that Buckman should assume {{him to be the}} source of the sound rather than Nimoy. O'Brien responded, [...] "You're the captain! You outrank him! It's your responsibility!" [...] Pressed further by O'Brien on the sound's provenance, Shatner suggested that {{it may have been a}} dog bark or a bird call. According to Jaysen, the sound did not emanate from Shatner, and was most likely caused by cables rubbing against each other while a camera moved. [...] "It was probably some machine that nobody heard", Shatner said in a September 2002 interview. [...] "The controversy is over." ...|$|E
500|$|... "DNA" [...] is a mid-tempo electropop and R ballad, which {{incorporates}} {{influences of}} dubstep and runs {{for three minutes}} and 56 seconds. It contains an instrumentation consisted of a guitar riff, skittering and thumping drum beats, and spooky synthesisers accompanied with Little Mix's vocal performance. According to music website Popjustice, the song features [...] "a <b>squeaky</b> door effect" [...] and [...] "Cheiron-style slamming smashy noises." [...] Vicky Newman of the Shields Gazette said that the track has an urban edge to it. The song begins with a tinkling music box before Perrie Edwards starts singing the line [...] "Does he love you when you least expect it," [...] in a low register. After the second chorus, the song almost stops completely before a half-rapped, half-spoken middle eight, followed by a choral breakdown. The choral breakdown, described as [...] "Gothic" [...] by many critics, gives way to brief rave klaxon instrumentation. Viewed as a dark song by Little Mix and music critics alike, [...] "DNA" [...] sees the group depart from their fun and upbeat sound on previous single, [...] "Wings". It has been heavily compared to Katy Perry's [...] "E.T.", which was an influential factor in the song's development.|$|E
500|$|The male {{mistle thrush}} has a loud melodious song with fluted whistles, {{sounding}} like chewee-trewuu... trureetruuruu or similar, repeated {{three to six}} times, and used to advertise his territory, attract a mate and maintain the pair bond. The tone resembles that of the song thrush or blackbird, but compared to its relatives the mistle thrush's repertoire is less varied and the delivery is slower. The song is, however, much louder, often audible up to 2km (2,000yd) away. The song is given from a treetop or other elevated position mainly from November to early June. The male is most vocal in the early morning, and its tendency to sing after, and sometimes during, wet and windy weather led to the old name [...] "stormcock". The song may be heard in any month, although it is uncommon from July to August while the thrush is moulting. The main call, given by both sexes, is a dry chattering krrrr, louder when it is alarmed or excited. It is often likened {{to the sound of}} a football rattle, a form of musical ratchet. There is also a <b>squeaky</b> tuk contact call.|$|E
