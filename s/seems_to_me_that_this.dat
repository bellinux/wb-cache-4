2500|$|... "Tarski has {{stressed}} in {{his lecture}} (and I think justly) the great {{importance of the}} concept of general recursiveness (or Turing's computability). It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> importance is largely {{due to the fact that}} with this concept one has for the first time succeeded in giving an absolute notion to an interesting epistemological notion, i.e., one not depending on the formalism chosen.*"(GÃ¶del 1946 in Davis 1965:84).|$|E
2500|$|The Dorothy Vernon {{room in the}} Deanery was {{designed}} by {{the architects of the}} second renovation, Archer and Allen, and Lockwood de Forest. De Forest decorated the spaces between the dark, exposed ceiling beams with decorative brass panels with East Indian patterns. The floor, like several other spaces on campus, was of Mercer tiles as per the request of Thomas herself as seen a 1908 letter to Mercer when she notes, [...] "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> large room would not be complete unless it had a tile floor." ...|$|E
60|$|I may be mistaken, {{but it does}} <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Deerslayer is not {{a work of art}} in any sense; it does <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> it is {{destitute}} {{of every}} detail that goes to the making of a work of art; in truth, it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Deerslayer is just simply a literary delirium tremens.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{the most}} terrible thing in likenesses I have ever seen," [...] the woman {{continued}} slowly. [...] "When you entered the room a few seconds ago, it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> a miracle had happened. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the dead had come to life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A balloon?" [...] said Bernard. [...] "Nay, it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{till they}} were over, I never thought at all except {{how to get}} the most rollicking and the finest rowing out of life. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I had about as much sense as a green monkey." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Richie," [...] said Sir Mungo, [...] "it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{bride of}} yours {{is like to}} be master and mair in the {{conjugal}} state." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{has gone}} without his hat,' he murmured. 'It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is {{practically}} {{a case of}} running amok. And now {{to break the news}} to bereaved Comrade Gregory.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What!" [...] exclaimed Mrs. Fox, when {{from the}} other side of the lawn she saw him alight. [...] "Another young man with a valise! It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is an overdose!" ...|$|E
60|$|It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> young Bingo {{must have}} boosted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> some purpose.|$|R
60|$|And it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I {{had heard}} those words from him before.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the man's iron repose was shaken.|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> watch has {{the worst}} of it, Captain Lockett. We had from eight to twelve, and now from four to eight; and the other had only four hours on deck." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait," [...] and Dane's voice stopped him. [...] "Now, I don't fancy {{that would}} do. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{is a case}} in which a woman to look after him would be necessary." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{benefited from}} it. Now {{point out to}} me the various movements. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> large French battery must have galled the whole line terribly; but, on the other hand, it is itself very exposed." ...|$|E
60|$|I hesitated. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Grooten {{was taking}} {{a great deal for}} granted.|$|R
60|$|LORD GORING. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I am {{a little}} in the way here.|$|R
60|$|It almost <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I had, but Tedham {{came to my}} rescue most unexpectedly.|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is a {{good deal}} of fuss to make about one human being, a mere passing man and brother of a day, isn't it?" [...] said the colonel. [...] "Go on with Donnacona, do." ...|$|E
60|$|It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> one is {{distinctly}} {{superior to}} the one that was inspired for last year's edition. It is strange, but to my mind plain, that inspiring is an art which does not improve with practice.--M. T.|$|E
6000|$|... "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> report {{leaves us}} {{no room for}} doubt," [...] he said, when Carnally had {{finished}} reading the papers. [...] "We can't keep the mine working on such returns as these. But I want your honest opinion." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> online {{copyright}} infringement is {{a legitimate}} problem, but it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> COICA as written is the wrong medicine. Deploying this statute to combat online copyright infringement seems almost like using a bunker-busting cluster bomb when {{what you really need}} is a precision-guided missile. The collateral damage of this statute could be American innovation, American jobs, and a secure Internet." ...|$|R
60|$|The Baron hesitated. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he was {{peering into}} the shadows beyond the hedge.|$|R
60|$|BRASSBOUND. We'd {{have been}} somewhere, at all events. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> now I am nowhere.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear me!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "I do {{not know}} much about champagne, but it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> has not been opened very long. By the by, you all drank champagne?" [...] he went on. [...] "I see no trace of any spirits about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is a {{case that}} will take all a man's time and his brains. I have other work to do; but I shall be more than interested, and if I can help in any {{possible}} way I shall be glad to do so!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Kennedy {{is full of}} expedients, doctor, and it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> may {{be really}} a {{valuable}} one. All the cavalry men have jack boots, and I {{will give you an}} order to requisition as many as may be required. The men can get new ones from the stores at Ghent." ...|$|E
60|$|It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{there is}} an ugly cloud {{gathering}} on the political horizon in Natal.|$|R
25|$|It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Berlin {{would not}} be at all {{suitable}} for me while M.Euler is there.|$|R
60|$|I {{was utterly}} stunned; {{it had not}} <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> any wound could be mortal to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is a {{very strange}} {{position}} for a lady to take who {{was not going to}} close an eye last night in view of a situation which has not changed in the least, except for the worse. Don't you think you are rather culpably light-hearted all of a sudden?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is {{a little}} disheartening," [...] he said. [...] "It is exactly what one might have {{expected}} from Horlock or even Lethbridge. Miller, who is nearer to the proletariat than any of us, would have us believe that the people who should be the bulwark of the State are not fit for their position." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 12. Uses. By {{many thought}} delicious eating. (Bewick.) The fact is, or <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> entire group of marsh birds {{is meant to}} become to us the {{domestic}} poultry of marshy land; and I imagine that by proper irrigation and care, many districts of otherwise useless bog and sand, might be made more profitable to us than many fishing-grounds.|$|E
60|$|Lady Delahaye {{raised her}} eyebrows. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{in a quiet}} way she was {{becoming}} angry.|$|R
60|$|Lestrade {{shook his}} head, though it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> his manner was less {{absolutely}} assured than before.|$|R
60|$|There was a moment's silence. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the Duke was {{watching}} me with peculiar intentness.|$|R
