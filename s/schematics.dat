5|$|In {{addition}} to finding weaponry {{out in the}} wastelands, the player can also create their own. To craft such weapons, the player must use a workbench, possess either the necessary <b>schematics</b> or the right Perk, and scavenge for the items needed to make them. These weapons usually possess significant advantages over other weapons of their type. Each weapon's schematic has three copies that can be found, and possessing additional copies improves the condition (or number) of items produced at the workbench, while a higher repair skill {{will result in a}} better starting condition for the related weapon. Weapon <b>schematics</b> can be found lying in certain locations, bought from vendors, or received as quest rewards.|$|E
5|$|Several privately {{produced}} <b>schematics</b> {{are available}} online or in printed form, {{such as those}} by Hagstrom Map. Additionally, the New York City subway map {{has served as the}} subject of artistic endeavors.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by Atari, Inc. beginning in 1974; the earliest <b>schematics</b> in the service manual are from June 1974, while the last is from November. The <b>schematics</b> bear the logos of both Atari and Kee Games, a subsidiary company set up by Atari in 1973 {{in order to reach}} more distributors, which was merged with Atari in December 1974. The game was announced and shown at the Music Operators of America (MOA) Music & Amusement Machines Exposition on November 1–3, 1974, for release that month. It was then advertised in the December 7 issue of Cash Box.|$|E
5|$|In 2018, John Connor (Bale) leads {{an attack}} on a Skynet base, where he discovers human prisoners and <b>schematics</b> for a new type of Terminator, {{incorporating}} living tissue, the T-800. John survives a violent assault on the base, which is destroyed. Following John's departure, Marcus emerges from the base's wreckage and begins walking towards Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Bresnahan also {{developed}} the first batting helmet. He {{was hit in}} the head with a pitch by Andy Coakley of the Cincinnati Reds on June 18, 1907. Bresnahan was unconscious, and a Catholic priest read him his last rites. Bresnahan was hospitalized for ten days, during which time he developed <b>schematics</b> for a plastic batting helmet, though this piece of equipment did not become commonplace until the 1940s. Bresnahan was also the first catcher to wear a padded facemask while catching.|$|E
5|$|The {{project is}} put under tight {{security}} and its progress followed worldwide. Arroway learns that the signal also {{contains more than}} 60,000 pages of indecipherable data. The reclusive Hadden secretly meets with Arroway to provide the means to decode the pages, found when they are arranged in three dimensions rather than two-dimensional pages. The pages reveal <b>schematics</b> for a complex machine that is determined {{to be some kind}} of transport for a single occupant.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of {{the virus}} shows it was {{manufactured}} by the Illuminati, prompting Tong to send JC to Paris {{to try to make}} contact with the organization and obtain their help fighting Majestic 12. JC eventually meets with Illuminati leader Morgan Everett and learns that the Gray Death virus was intended to be used for augmentation technology, but Majestic 12, led by trillionaire businessman and former Illuminatus Bob Page, was able to steal and repurpose it into its current viral form. Everett recognizes that without VersaLife's universal constructor, Majestic 12 can no longer create the virus, and will likely target Vandenberg Air Force Base, where X-51, a group of former Area 51 scientists, have built another one. After aiding the base personnel in repelling a Majestic 12 attack, JC meets X-51 leader Gary Savage, who reveals that Daedalus is an artificial intelligence (AI) borne out of the ECHELON program. Everett attempts to gain control over Majestic 12's communications network by releasing Daedalus onto the U.S. military networks, but Page counters by releasing his own AI, Icarus, which merges with Daedalus to form a new AI, Helios, with the ability to control all global communications. After this, Savage enlists JC's help in procuring <b>schematics</b> for reconstructing components for the UC that were damaged during Majestic 12's raid of Vandenberg. JC finds the <b>schematics</b> and electronically transmits them to Savage. Page intercepts the transmission and launches a nuclear missile at Vandenberg to ensure that Area 51 (now Majestic 12's headquarters), will be the only location in the world with an operational UC. However, JC is able to reprogram the missile to strike Area 51. JC then travels there himself to confront Page.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile Captain Archer, {{accompanied}} by Lieutenant Reed, Ensign Sato, {{and a team}} of MACOs, enters the vortex created by the Xindi weapon. During the pursuit, a recovering Sato is pushed by Archer to decipher Degra's <b>schematics.</b> Again Archer is suddenly pulled into the future by Temporal Agent Daniels, this time to the founding of the United Federation of Planets, but Archer is again uninterested. Arriving near Earth, Archer receives an unexpected transmission from Commander Shran, who engages and then destroys the Reptilian ship. In the chaos, Archer and his team are able to beam aboard the weapon. A fierce fire-fight ensues, and as Archer and Sato try to disable the weapon, Commander Dolim attempts to stop them. He fails and the weapon is destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Sinclair sends Lothar to Cliff and Peevy's home to {{find the}} rocket pack. The FBI arrives, but Cliff and Peevy escape, while Lothar steals its {{detailed}} <b>schematics</b> drawn up by Peevy. Later, at the airfield diner, Cliff and Peevy are trapped by several Valentine mobsters; they learn that Jenny had a date with Sinclair, and of the actor's involvement {{in the hunt for}} the rocket pack. The diner patrons overpower the gangsters, while a bullet ricochet punctures the rocket's fuel tank, which Peevy temporarily patches with Cliff's chewing gum. Cliff proceeds to the South Seas Club, where he tells Jenny about his new alter ego. The Valentine gang arrives, and Jenny is kidnapped by Sinclair in the ensuing melée.|$|E
5|$|Alcorn first {{examined}} Bushnell's <b>schematics</b> for Computer Space, {{but found}} them to be illegible. He went on to create his own designs based on his knowledge of transistor–transistor logic and Bushnell's game. Feeling the basic game was too boring, Alcorn added features to give the game more appeal. He divided the paddle into eight segments to change the ball's angle of return. For example, the center segments return the ball a 90° angle in relation to the paddle, while the outer segments return the ball at smaller angles. He also made the ball accelerate the longer it remained in play; missing the ball reset the speed. Another feature was that the in-game paddles were unable to reach the top of screen. This was caused by a simple circuit that had an inherent defect. Instead of dedicating time to fixing the defect, Alcorn decided it gave the game more difficulty and helped limit the time the game could be played; he imagined two skilled players being able to play forever otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Although Amanda gains {{access to}} a revolver, a shotgun, a bolt gun, and a {{flamethrower}} {{over the course of}} the game, Alien: Isolation emphasizes evasion over direct combat by providing the player with limited ammunition. Fortunately, the player can also craft several items by collecting <b>schematics</b> and different kind of materials throughout the game. Items range from EMP mines to noisemakers, molotov cocktails and pipe bombs, among others. These items help the player deal with enemies and the alien. For example, the noisemaker can be used to attract enemies in one particular direction. The alien is afraid of fire, so using the flamethrower or a molotov cocktail will force it to retreat into the station's ventilation system. The player has a limited amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. Nevertheless, the player can restore lost health using medkits, which can be crafted with materials in Amanda's inventory.|$|E
5|$|Although Evans {{had always}} {{suffered}} from bouts of depression, and bitterness towards those he felt did not appreciate his inventions, such sentiments seemed to peak {{in his later}} years. During {{one of his many}} legal battles in 1809, comments from the presiding judge sent Evans into a particular fury in which he dramatically incinerated many <b>schematics</b> and papers regarding his inventions, both prior and future. Evans declared at the time that inventing had led only to heartache, disappointment and under-appreciation; and committed himself to business and material acquisition {{for the sake of his}} family. Ultimately what was burned represents only a small proportion of what survives from Evans, and he did continue his interest in inventing, but the tone of Evans's later life was undoubtedly one of hostility and disappointment.|$|E
5|$|Janek (Idris Elba) is {{captain of}} the Prometheus. Following Holloway's suggestion, he lands the ship near the {{structure}} containing the Juggernaut. During the expedition Janek remains on the Prometheus, observing the <b>schematics</b> which Fifield's spectagraphs develop. He seduces Meredith Vickers while Sean Fifield and Rafe Milburn radio for direction. Vickers and Janek recognize the Juggernaut as an Engineer ship. While Shaw prepares to join Weyland on the expedition to awaken the Engineer, Janek says that the Engineers had nefarious intentions with the biological weapons and he will {{do whatever is necessary}} to protect Earth's interests. When Vickers orders Janek to bring the Prometheus home, Shaw tells him that the Engineer ship is headed to Earth to release the black liquid and annihilate the human race. Janek decides to steer the Prometheus into the Engineer ship, and orders everyone to leave. Assistant pilots Chance and Ravel refuse and help Janek run the Prometheus into the Engineer ship, crippling it, sacrificing themselves, and saving the human race.|$|E
5|$|Shepard {{destroys the}} machine {{powering}} it and prepares {{to destroy the}} Collector base. However, the Illusive Man contacts Shepard and gives the order to sterilize the base instead with a timed radiation pulse {{so that it can}} be used against the Reapers. After deciding the fate of the base, Shepard destroys the awakened Human-Reaper and escapes with the surviving squad members. If no squad members survive, Shepard fails to escape and dies. Back on the Normandy, Shepard speaks with the Illusive Man, who is either pleased or furious with Shepard's decision. As Shepard meets in the Normandys cargo bay with the survivors, Joker gives the Commander <b>schematics</b> of a Reaper. Humanity now has the full attention of the Reapers, who awaken in dark space and descend upon the galaxy.|$|E
5|$|The shape-shifting Mystique gains {{information}} about Magneto's prison and helps him escape while also discovering <b>schematics</b> {{for a second}} Cerebro. Wolverine, Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro visit Iceman's parents in Boston and meet up with Storm, Jean, and Nightcrawler. The X-Jet is attacked by fighter jets en route back to the mansion and is shot down, but Magneto saves them from crashing. Magneto explains to the group that Stryker has built the second Cerebro to use it, and Xavier, to telepathically kill every mutant on the planet. Stryker's son, Jason, is a mutant with mind-controlling powers, which Stryker will use to force Xavier to do this. Stryker had also previously used Jason's powers to orchestrate Nightcrawler's attack as a pretense to gain approval to invade Xavier's mansion. Magneto also tells Wolverine that Stryker {{was the man who}} grafted his adamantium skeleton onto his bones. Jean reads Nightcrawler's mind and determines that Stryker's base is underground in a dam at Alkali Lake.|$|E
5|$|In Gotham City, {{some time}} after {{defeating}} the Penguin, the crime fighter Batman defuses a hostage situation caused by a criminal known as Two-Face, the alter ego of the former district attorney Harvey Dent, but Two-Face escapes and remains at large. Edward Nygma, a researcher at Wayne Enterprises who idolizes Bruce Wayne, has developed a device that can beam television into a person's brain. Bruce offers to let Nygma come up with <b>schematics</b> for the device {{and set up a}} meeting with his assistant. However, after Nygma demands an answer from him immediately, Bruce rejects the invention, believing it to be too close to mind manipulation. After killing his supervisor Fred Stickley, Nygma resigns and seeks retaliation against Bruce for rejecting his invention and begins to send him riddles (Nygma rigs the security cameras to record Stickley committing suicide, as well as a suicide note, which everybody believes but Bruce Wayne doubts this is the truth) A news report reveals how Harvey Dent became Two-Face: when he was prosecuting a mob boss named Sal Maroni, Maroni threw acid on Dent's face, disfiguring half of it. Batman tried to save him, but failed. After the incident, Dent seeks to kill Batman for failing to save him. Bruce meets Chase Meridian, a psychiatrist who is obsessed with Batman, and invites her to come with him to a circus event. After a performance from the circus performers, The Flying Graysons, Two-Face arrives and threatens to blow up the circus unless Batman comes forward and surrenders his life to him. The Flying Graysons attempt to stop Two-Face, but most of them get killed as a result. Only Dick Grayson, the youngest member, survives as he climbs to the roof and throws Two-Face's bomb into a river.|$|E
25|$|In April 2007, the Hines-led {{development}} group submitted its {{preliminary design}} <b>schematics</b> {{to the city}} for approval. The submission focused on the redevelopment of the park on the northwestern corner of the site, the reopening of 10th and I Streets NW, and the six parcels of land for the office buildings and residential housing. All buildings were designed to meet existing zoning regulations. Approval of the <b>schematics</b> and signing of the lease for the land were anticipated to occur in May 2007, so that construction could begin that fall. The <b>schematics</b> showed that 464 residential units would be apartments, and 222 units would be condominiums. Each building was 11 or 12 stories tall, and sheathed in glass and steel.|$|E
25|$|Model B rev. 2 {{also has}} a pad (called P5 {{on the board and}} P6 on the <b>schematics)</b> of 8 pins {{offering}} access to an additional 4 GPIO connections.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} many tools to support {{specific}} engineering {{tasks such as}} computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software to generate CNC machining instructions; manufacturing process management software for production engineering; EDA for printed circuit board (PCB) and circuit <b>schematics</b> for electronic engineers; MRO applications for maintenance management; and AEC software for civil engineering.|$|E
25|$|As a {{schematic}} diagram, {{it does not}} show the geographic locations but rather the relative positions of the stations, lines, the stations' connective relations, and fare zones. The basic design concepts have been widely adopted for other such maps around the world, and for maps of other sorts of transport networks and even conceptual <b>schematics.</b>|$|E
25|$|According to Lockhart, {{when the}} German Kaiser was {{expanding}} the war machine of Imperial Germany in 1909, British intelligence had scant knowledge regarding {{the types of}} weapons being forged inside Germany's war plants. At the behest of British intelligence, Reilly was sent to obtain {{the plans for the}} weapons. Reilly arrived in Essen, Germany, in 1909 disguised as a Baltic shipyard worker by the name of Karl Hahn. Having prepared his cover identity by learning welding at a Sheffield engineering firm, Reilly obtained a low-level position as a welder at the Essen plant. Soon he joined the plant fire brigade and persuaded its foreman that a set of plant <b>schematics</b> were needed to indicate the position of fire extinguishers and hydrants. These <b>schematics</b> were soon lodged in the foreman's office for members of the fire brigade to consult, and Reilly set about using them to locate the plans.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the rise}} of {{reconfigurable}} programmable logic devices, sharing of logic designs has been a form of open-source hardware. Instead of the <b>schematics,</b> hardware description language (HDL) code is shared. HDL descriptions are commonly used to set up system-on-a-chip systems either in field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) or directly in application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designs. HDL modules, when distributed, are called semiconductor intellectual property cores, or IP cores.|$|E
25|$|Within the {{scientific}} community, {{there is already}} considerable agreement {{in the form of}} the <b>schematics</b> used to represent electronic circuits, chemical symbols, mathematical symbols, and the Energy Systems Language of systems ecology. We can also see the international efforts at regularizing symbols used to regulate traffic, to indicate resources for tourists, and in maps. Some symbols have become nearly universal through their consistent use in computers and on the internet.|$|E
25|$|The Electronic Frontier Foundation has {{an ongoing}} lawsuit (Hepting v. AT) against the telecom giant AT Inc. for its {{assistance}} to the U.S. government in monitoring the communications of millions of American citizens. It has managed thus far to keep the proceedings open. Recently the documents, which were exposed by a whistleblower who had previously worked for AT, and showed <b>schematics</b> of the massive data mining system, were made public.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} widely used design tools in the {{profession}} is computer-aided design (CAD) software like CATIA, Autodesk Inventor, DSS SolidWorks or Pro Engineer which enables engineers to create 3D models, 2D drawings, and <b>schematics</b> of their designs. CAD together with digital mockup (DMU) and CAE software such as finite element method analysis or analytic element method allows engineers to create models of designs that can be analyzed without having to make expensive and time-consuming physical prototypes.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Evie {{looks for}} the Piece of Eden, {{managing}} to steal an Assassin journal from Thorne. Analyzing the journal, Evie discovers that {{it refers to the}} Shroud of Eden, a Piece of Eden that can heal any injury, including old age, and makes the wearer immortal. She follows the trail of clues underneath the mansion of , where she finds a map detailing the locations of all of the Assassin vaults hidden in London. Her search leads her to famous landmarks such as the Monument to the Great Fire of London and St. Paul's Cathedral. She obtains the key needed to access the Shroud's vault, but it is stolen by Thorne. Evie then heads to the Tower of London, where the vault is located and assassinates Thorne. Thorne explains the Shroud is not in the Tower and claims that the Assassins have no idea of the true power of the Shroud before dying. Green believes the real vault is hidden in Buckingham Palace, and enlists the aid of the Maharajah Duleep Singh to find the <b>schematics</b> for the building. Unfortunately, the Templars manage to seize the <b>schematics</b> first. In addition to her hunt for the Shroud, Evie also helps correct the unintended consequences Jacob's assassinations have caused such as medicine shortages and currency inflation.|$|E
25|$|Trespasser is {{the third}} and the last single-player {{downloadable}} content for the game. Players continue to {{assume the role of}} the Inquisitor, and have to face against a Qunari invasion and reestablish the authority of the Inquisition. The Trespasser DLC is set two years after the original game's ending. New wardrobe options and a Golden Nug statue, which allows players to keep all their acquired <b>schematics</b> and recipes, are also introduced in this downloadable content. It was announced during PAX Prime on August 29, 2015, and was released on September 8, 2015 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. According to BioWare, the team took inspirations from Indiana Jones and Captain America to create the game's story.|$|E
25|$|In February 1941, Camm {{commenced}} {{a series}} of discussions with officials within the Ministry of Aircraft Production {{on the topic of}} the P.1012. In March 1941 of that year, clearance to proceed with development of the design, referred to at this point as the Typhoon II, was granted. At this point, work was undertaken by a team of 45 draughtsmen at Hawker's wartime experimental design office at Claremont, Esher to convert the proposal into technical <b>schematics</b> from which to commence manufacture. In March 1941, the Air Ministry issued specification F.10/41 that had been written to fit the aircraft. By October 1941, development of the proposal had advanced {{to the point where the}} new design was finalised.|$|E
25|$|The {{perpetrators}} left three {{explosive devices}} connected {{to one another}} at the Inland Regional Center, contained inside the backpack left by Farook during the departmental event. The devices were described as pipe bombs constructed with Christmas lights and tied together, combined with a remote controlled car that was switched on. The poorly constructed devices failed to explode. Authorities believe that the pipe bombs were meant to target the emergency personnel responding to the scene. The device was hidden inside a canvas bag, and its build was similar to <b>schematics</b> published in Al Qaeda's Inspire magazine. Coworkers noticed the bag before the attack occurred, but thought that Farook would return for it and therefore did not investigate it.|$|E
25|$|On Earth, Mamoru's brother Susumu is {{scavenging}} on the irradiated surface {{near the}} half-buried {{wreck of the}} battleship Yamato, when an object impacts near him and knocks him unconscious. He awakens to find an alien message capsule. Susumu also notices that the radiation {{has been reduced to}} safe levels around him. He is rescued by Okita's returning ship and it is discovered that the capsule contains engineering <b>schematics</b> for a new warp drive and coordinates for the planet from which it came (Iskandar). After learning what happened at Mars, Susumu accuses Okita of using his brother as a sacrificial lamb and tries to hit him, but crewmember Yuki Mori violently stops him.|$|E
25|$|The {{documentary}} {{evidence for the}} construction of ancient galleys is fragmentary, particularly in pre-Roman times. Plans and <b>schematics</b> in the modern sense did not exist until the 17th century and nothing like them has survived from ancient times. How galleys were constructed has therefore been a matter of looking at circumstantial evidence in literature, art, coinage and monuments that include ships, some of them actually in natural size. Since the war galleys floated even with a ruptured hull and virtually never had any ballast or heavy cargo that could sink them, not a single wreckage of one has so far been found. The only exception has been a partial wreckage of a small Punic liburnian from the Roman era, the Marsala Ship.|$|E
25|$|In March 1992 Heath {{announced}} that it was discontinuing electronic kits after 45 years. The company had been the last large survivor of a dozen kit manufacturers during the 1960s. In 1995 Bull sold Heathkit to a private investor group called HIG, which then sold it to another investment group in 1998. Wanting to only concentrate on the educational products, this group sold the Heath/Zenith name and products to DESA International, a maker of specialty tools and heaters. In late 2008, Heathkit Educational Systems sold a large portion of its collection of legacy kit <b>schematics</b> and manuals along with permission to make reproductions to Don Peterson, though it still retained the copyrights and trademarks, and has pointers to people that can help with the older equipment.|$|E
25|$|Open-source {{hardware}} (OSH) {{consists of}} physical artifacts of technology designed and {{offered by the}} open design movement. Both free and open-source software (FOSS) and open-source hardware are created by this open-source culture movement and apply a like concept {{to a variety of}} components. It is sometimes, thus, referred to as FOSH (free and open-source hardware). The term usually means that information about the hardware is easily discerned so that others can make it – coupling it closely to the maker movement. Hardware design (i.e. mechanical drawings, <b>schematics,</b> bills of material, PCB layout data, HDL source code and integrated circuit layout data), in addition to the software that drives the hardware, are all released under free/libre terms. The original sharer gains feedback and potentially improvements on the design from the FOSH community. There is now significant evidence that such sharing can drive a high return on investment for investors.|$|E
