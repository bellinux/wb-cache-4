5000|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the Syrian Civil War in March 2011, tourism has declined steeply. According to official reports, hotel rooms designed for foreign tourists have been occupied by refugees. In the first quarter of 2012, tourism revenue was about 12.8 billion <b>Syrian</b> <b>pounds</b> ($178 million), compared with 52 billion <b>Syrian</b> <b>pounds</b> ($1 billion) {{in the first quarter of}} 2011, and the number of foreign tourists decreased by more than 76 percent in the 2012 quarter. Employment in the tourism industry was down by [...] "nearly two-thirds" [...] in that period. According to UNESCO, five of Syria's six World Heritage Sites have been affected by the civil war.

5000|$|Robert Kalina (born 29 June 1955) is an Austrian designer. For the National Bank of Austria {{he created}} the T 382 design, which was the winning design of the 1996 {{competition}} for the art shown on the euro banknotes. Kalina's design was chosen by the EMI Council (European Monetary Institute) on 3 December 1996. [...] Kalina also designed the banknotes for the Azerbaijani manat, the 2010 series of the <b>Syrian</b> <b>Pound</b> and the Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark.|$|E
5000|$|... the Syrian economy relies upon {{inherently}} unreliable revenue {{sources such}} as dwindling customs and income taxes which are heavily bolstered by lines of credit from Iran. Iran is believed to spend between $6 billion and $20 billion USD a year on Syria during the Syrian Civil War. The Syrian economy has contracted 60% and the <b>Syrian</b> <b>pound</b> has lost 80% of its value, with the economy becoming part state-owned and part war economy. At {{the outset of the}} ongoing Syrian Civil War, Syria was classified by the World Bank as a [...] "lower middle income country." [...] In 2010, Syria remained dependent on the oil and agriculture sectors. The oil sector provided about 40% of export earnings. Proven offshore expeditions have indicated that large sums of oil exist on the Mediterranean Sea floor between Syria and Cyprus. The agriculture sector contributes to about 20% of GDP and 20% of employment. Oil reserves are expected to decrease in the coming years and Syria has already become a net oil importer. Since the civil war began, the economy shrank by 35%, and the <b>Syrian</b> <b>pound</b> has fallen to one-sixth of its prewar value. The government increasingly relies on credit from Iran, Russia and China.|$|E
5000|$|On 24 March, Assad's media adviser, Buthaina Shaaban, {{said that}} the {{government}} will be [...] "studying the possibility of lifting the emergency law and licensing political parties". The Syrian government also announced a cut in personal taxation rates, an increase in public sector salaries of 1,500 <b>Syrian</b> <b>pounds</b> ($32.60 US) a month and pledges to increase press freedom, create more employment opportunities, and reduce corruption.|$|R
50|$|Even in July 2013, it was {{reported}} that foreign fighters continued to come to Syria and commit atrocities against both supporters and opponents of the government, as well as clashing with moderate rebel groups. This followed President Bashar al-Assad signing into law a bill that would punish anyone entering the country illegally with jail time and a fine. The fine would be between five million and 10 million <b>Syrian</b> <b>pounds.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1941, the peg to the French franc was {{replaced}} by a peg to the British <b>pound</b> of 8.83125 <b>Syrian</b> <b>pounds</b> = 1 British pound, {{as a consequence of the}} occupation of Syria by British and Free French forces. This rate was based on the pre-war conversion rate between the franc and sterling. In 1946, following devaluation of the franc, the pound was pegged once again to the franc at a rate of 1 pound = 54.35 francs. In 1947, the U.S. dollar was adopted as the peg for the Syrian currency, with 2.19148 pounds = 1 dollar, a rate which was maintained until 1961. The Lebanese and Syrian currencies split in 1948. From 1961, a series of official exchange rates were in operation, alongside a parallel, black market rate which reflected the true market rate for <b>Syrian</b> <b>pounds</b> in Jordan and Lebanon where there was a healthy trade in the Syrian currency. The market was allowed to flourish because everybody, including government and public sector companies, needed it. The black market rate diverged dramatically from the official rate in the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} {{abbreviation for}} the <b>Syrian</b> <b>pound</b> is SYP. On 5 December 2005, the selling rate quoted by the Commercial Bank of Syria was 58.4 SYP to the US dollar. A {{rate of about}} 50 pounds to one dollar has been usual in the early 2000s, but the exchange rate is subject to fluctuations. Since {{the start of the}} civil war against president Bashar al-Assad in 2011, the pound's exchange rate has deteriorated significantly, falling from 47 SYP for US$1 in March 2011 to 515 SYP for US$1 in July 2017.|$|E
5000|$|The {{denominations}} of {{most modern}} currencies, notably the euro and British pound, follow a 1-2-5 series. The United States and Canada follow the series 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 (cents), and also $5 and $10 which {{belong to the}} same series. However, after that comes $20, not $25. The ¼-½-1 series (... 0.1 0.25 0.5 1 2.5 5 10 ...) is also used by currencies derived from the former Dutch gulden (Aruban florin, Netherlands Antillean gulden, Surinamese dollar), some Middle Eastern currencies (Iraqi and Jordanian dinars, Lebanese pound, <b>Syrian</b> <b>pound),</b> and the Seychellois rupee. However, newer notes introduced in Lebanon and Syria due to inflation follow the standard 1-2-5 series instead.|$|E
50|$|The 10 <b>Syrian</b> <b>pound</b> coin {{is often}} used as a slug in Norway, as the shape and weight of this coin {{strongly}} resembles the 20 Norwegian krone coin. As of February 1, 2014, ten Syrian pounds converts to 0.44 Norwegian kroner. 20 NOK is over 45.4 times {{the value of the}} Syrian coin. While not easy to find in Norway, the Syrian coins are still used in automated machines there with such frequency that Posten Norge, the Norwegian postal service, decided to close many of their coins-to-cash machines on February 18, 2006, with plans to develop a system able to differentiate between the two coins. In the summer of 2005, a Norwegian man was sentenced to 30 days, suspended, for having used Syrian coins in arcade machines in the municipality of Bærum.|$|E
50|$|Also in 2009, the Sudanese {{government}} banned QuestNet after {{allegations were}} made relating to poor product {{quality and the}} non-receipt of products.

2500|$|Smoking in Syria is {{currently}} banned inside cafes (hookah bars), restaurants {{and other public}} spaces by a presidential decree issued on 12 October 2009 which went into effect on 21 April 2010.

50|$|Syria {{has taken}} gradual steps to loosen {{controls}} over foreign exchange. In 2003, the government canceled {{a law that}} criminalized private sector use of foreign currencies, and in 2005 it issued legislation that allowed licensed private banks to sell specific amounts of foreign currency to Syrian citizens under certain circumstances and {{to the private sector}} to finance imports. In October 2009, the Syrian Government further loosened its restrictions on currency transfers by allowing Syrians travelling abroad to withdraw the equivalent of up to U.S. $10,000 from their <b>Syrian</b> <b>pound</b> accounts. In practice, the decision allows local banks to open accounts of a maximum of U.S. $10,000 that their clients can use for their international payment cards. The holders of these accounts will be able to withdraw up to U.S. $10,000 per month while travelling abroad.|$|E
50|$|Before World War I, the Ottoman lira was used. In 1918, {{after the}} fall of the Ottoman Empire, the {{currency}} became the Egyptian pound. Upon gaining control of Syria and Lebanon, the French replaced the Egyptian pound with a new currency for Syria and Lebanon, the <b>Syrian</b> <b>pound,</b> which was linked to the French franc at a value of 1 pound = 20 francs. Lebanon issued its own coins from 1924 and banknotes from 1925. In 1939, the Lebanese currency was officially separated from that of Syria, though it was still linked to the French franc and remained interchangeable with Syrian money. In 1941, following France's defeat by Nazi Germany, the currency was linked instead to the British pound sterling at a rate of 8.83 Lebanese pounds = 1 pound sterling. A link to the French franc was restored after the war but was abandoned in 1949.|$|E
