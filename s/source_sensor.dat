40|$|In many blind source {{separation}} (BSS) applications, {{especially for}} biomedical signal processing, there are specific expectations regarding the {{spatial and temporal}} characteristics of some sources, but post-hoc comparisons between source estimates and anticipated outcomes can be complicated and unreliable. One alternative is to incorporate additional prior knowledge, e. g., about the spatial topography of selected <b>source</b> <b>sensor</b> projections, into the BSS approach by means of constraints. This letter describes {{a modified version of}} the FastICA algorithm for spatially constrained BSS, where the estimates of selected columns of the mixing matrix are constrained with reference to predetermined <b>source</b> <b>sensor</b> projections...|$|E
30|$|The frame {{rates at}} <b>source</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes are {{calculated}} {{in a different}} manner for each protocol. SUIT and FCE use fuzzy logic-based approach whereas QCC uses local buffer occupancy for deciding on the congestion level. According to the congestion level, the frame rate is assigned dynamically while generating images. In Figure  10, the average calculated frame rate at the <b>source</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes is illustrated. All of the protocols decrease the frame rate as the network is getting congested. QCC estimates the congestion level optimistically and therefore calculates higher frame rates than the others. On the other hand, FCE estimates the congestion in a pessimistic manner and calculates lower frame rates than the others. SUIT provides a balanced congestion level via its efficient fuzzy logic-based congestion estimation technique. Therefore, SUIT provides better performance than its competitors in all QoS metrics, except of the average received frame quality.|$|E

30|$|The {{evaluation}} {{is done in}} terms of the following: (a) network energy consumptions (i.e., transmission and receiving power), (b) transmission energy consumptions, (c) end-to-end data transmission delay, (d) accumulated routing delays, and (e) length of the paths {{in terms of the}} crossed hops. Network energy consumption is defined as the total energy consumed by all the sensors nodes for routing data over a certain period of time. Network energy consumptions also reflect the lifetime of the network, i.e., the remaining network energy. We measure the end-to-end delay as the time that is required to transmit data from any <b>source</b> <b>sensor</b> node to the BS based on the traversed Euclidean distances. Another type of delay is in terms of the routing delay. Using this metric, the accumulated routing delays from any <b>source</b> <b>sensor</b> node to the BS are measured. Between these pairs of nodes, we also use another metric that counts the number of hops traversed on the path way which actually measures the network's paths lengths.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Communication privacy {{techniques}} that pro-tect {{the locations of}} <b>source</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes and sink nodes from either global or local adversaries have received significant attention recently. The improvement in capture time, which is {{the time it takes}} for an adversary to identify the location of the source, is often estimated using simulations. In this paper, we present probabilistic models to analyze the expected capture time of <b>source</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes for recently privacy protocols against (1) local adversary using phantom routing, and (2) global adversary using statistically strong source anonymity (SSA). Using these models, we show that both phantom routing and SSA fall short of achieving high degree of anonymity. The phantom source routing improves the capture time over normal routing methods, but falls short of possible upper bounds on expected capture time. SSA is prone to simple time correlation attack by a global adversary; even with a large number of dummy message transmitted by non-source nodes, the propagation of one real message from source to sink will be sufficient to identify the source with almost no false positives. Based on these findings, we suggest a simple modification to SSA that increases the false positive rate to nearly 90 percent and thus the capture time. I...|$|E
40|$|Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) {{have many}} {{promising}} applications for monitoring critical regions, like military surveillance and wildlife monitor-ing. In such applications, {{it is critical}} to protect the location of the <b>source</b> <b>sensor</b> that generates the data, as exposure of this information usually re-veals the location of the object being monitored. Traditional security mech-anisms, like encryption, have been proven to be ineffective as the location of the source can also be revealed by analyzing the traffic flow in the net-work. In this paper, we investigate the source-location privacy issue. We first propose a realistic semi-global eavesdropping attack model and show its effectiveness in compromising an existing source-location preserving tech-nique. Furthermore, to measure source location privacy against the semi-global eavesdropper, we define a model for-angle anonymity. Additionally, we design a new protocol called Mules-Saving-Source (MSS) that preserves α-angle anonymity by adapting the conventional function of data mules. We theoretically analyze the delay incurred by using data mules in MSS, and we examine via extensive simulations the trade off between the delay and privacy preservation under different data mule mobility patterns. We cate-gorize the delay in MSS as being caused primarily due to the buffering time at the <b>source</b> <b>sensor</b> and the data mules. Motivated by this observation...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{wireless}} sensor network (WSN) technology adapted to underground channel conditions is developed, which has important theoretical and practical value for safety monitoring in underground coal mines. According to the characteristics that the space, time and frequency resources of underground tunnel are open, it is proposed to constitute wireless sensor nodes based on multicarrier {{code division multiple access}} (MC-CDMA) to make full use of these resources. To improve the wireless transmission performance of <b>source</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes, it is also proposed to utilize cooperative sensors with good channel conditions from the sink node to assist source sensors with poor channel conditions. Moreover, the total power of the <b>source</b> <b>sensor</b> and its cooperative sensors is allocated {{on the basis of their}} channel conditions to increase the energy efficiency of the WSN. To solve the problem that multiple access interference (MAI) arises when multiple source sensors transmit monitoring information simultaneously, a kind of multi-sensor detection (MSD) algorithm with particle swarm optimization (PSO), namely D-PSO, is proposed for the time-frequency coded cooperative MC-CDMA WSN. Simulation results show that the average bit error rate (BER) performance of the proposed WSN in an underground coal mine is improved significantly by using wireless sensor nodes based on MC-CDMA, adopting time-frequency coded cooperative transmission and D-PSO algorithm with particle swarm optimization...|$|E

This system also exploited the spatial diversity of the sensors; however, it was assumed that the time delay for transmission between the re-transmitters and the receptor sensor was greater than the largest channel delay. This condition implies the existence of large overhead (long guard time intervals) for extremely severe channel conditions. This study also assumes that all channels are flat fading.|$|E

40|$|Generalized cross {{validation}} (GCV) provides an effective method for {{the determination of}} optimal regularization parameters in acoustical inverse problems. The problem of reconstructing acoustic source distributions from field measurements is very often ill-posed. The use of Tikonhov regularization, for example, often suppresses the effect of small singular values in the Green function matrix to be inverted and these are in turn often associated with ``high spatial frequencies'' of the source distribution. The net effect is to produce a useful estimate of the acoustic source strength distribution but with a limited spatial resolution. This paper will explore the relationship between estimation accuracy, spatial resolution, noise level, and <b>source</b> <b>sensor</b> geometry when a range of inverse sound radiation problems is regularized using GCV.
