5|$|As part of {{improving}} road {{access to the}} Fort Dix Military Reservation {{at the onset of}} World War II, a Works Progress Administration project improved the paved road connecting the fort to Bordentown. In 1941, this road was legislated as Route S39, a state highway spur of Route 39 (now US206) that was to run from the fort to Mansfield <b>Square.</b> <b>Construction</b> on the access road was completed in 1943 at a cost of over $2 million. Route S39 became Route 68 in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering. The same year, an extension of Route 68 was legislated to run south from Fort Dix to the intersection with Route 70 and Route 72 at the Four Mile Circle. In 1961, a freeway was proposed along the Route 68 corridor, running from a planned Route 38 freeway near Fort Dix south to Route 70 and Route 72; however, this was never built.|$|E

25|$|In 1748, the Academy of Arts {{commissioned}} a monumental {{statue of the}} king on horseback by the sculptor Bouchardon, and the Academy of Architecture was assigned to create a square, to be called Place Louis XV, where it could be erected. The site selected was the marshy open space between the Seine, the moat and bridge to the Tuileries garden, and the Champs-Élysées, {{which led to the}} Étoile, convergence of hunting trails on {{the western edge of the}} city (now Place Charles de Gaulle-Étoile). The winning plans for the square and buildings next to it were drawn by the architect Ange-Jacques Gabriel. Gabriel designed two large mansions with a street between them, Rue Royale, designed to give a clear view of the statue in the center of the <b>square.</b> <b>Construction</b> began in 1754, and the statue was put in place and dedicated on 23 February 1763. The two large mansions were still unfinished, but the façades were finished in 1765-66.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{considered}} repeated-root cyclic codes whose {{block length}} is divisible by the {{characteristic of the}} underlying field. Cyclic self dual codes are also the repeated root cyclic codes. It {{is known about the}} one-level <b>squaring</b> <b>construction</b> for binary repeated root cyclic codes. In this correspondence, we introduced of two level <b>squaring</b> <b>construction</b> for binary repeated root cyclic codes of length 2 a b, a> 0, b is odd. Keywords—Squaring Construction, generator matrix, self dual codes, cyclic codes, coset codes, repeated root cyclic codes. p> 1. The codes having these types of properties are called repeated root cyclic codes. Nedeloaia [3] derived the one- level <b>squaring</b> <b>construction</b> for all binary repeated root cyclic codes by using VanLint’s [7] result. In this paper we will use the result proved by Nadeloaia [3] and give the two – level <b>squaring</b> <b>construction</b> for all binary repeated root cyclic codes. Manuscript is arranged in following manner. In Section II we presented the notation and definition. In Section III we had given the previous results and some definition of theorems which will be help in our study and we derived the generator matrix for 2 – level <b>squaring</b> <b>construction,</b> T I...|$|R

This algorithm involves 199 real operations, {{which is}} less than {{one half of the}} computational complexity of the known maximum-likelihood decoding algorithms for this code.
