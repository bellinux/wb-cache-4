5|$|The {{picture of}} Elizabeth painted by her Protestant admirers {{of the early}} 17th century has proved lasting and influential. Her memory was also revived during the Napoleonic Wars, when the nation again found itself {{on the brink of}} invasion. In the Victorian era, the Elizabethan legend was adapted to the {{imperial}} ideology of the day, and in the mid-20th century, Elizabeth was a romantic symbol of the national resistance to foreign threat. Historians of that period, such as J. E. Neale (1934) and A. L. Rowse (1950), interpreted Elizabeth's reign as a golden age of progress. Neale and Rowse also idealised the Queen personally: <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> everything right; her more unpleasant traits were ignored or explained as signs of stress.|$|E
5|$|With the Burger's {{house now}} empty, Rosa sells it and moves in with Conrad, {{a student who}} had befriended her during her father's trial. Conrad {{questions}} her about {{her role in the}} Burger family and asks why <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> what she was told. Later Rosa leaves Conrad and moves into a flat on her own and works as a physiotherapist. In 1975 Rosa attends a party of a friend in Soweto, and it is there that she hears a black university student dismissing all whites' help as irrelevant, saying that whites cannot know what blacks want, and that blacks will liberate themselves. Despite being labelled a Communist and under surveillance by the authorities, Rosa manages to get a passport, and flies to Nice in France to spend several months with Katya, her father's first wife. There she meets Bernard Chabalier, a visiting academic from Paris. They become lovers and he persuades her to return with him to Paris.|$|E
2500|$|David Foster said, [...] "My {{wife and}} I are {{in shock and}} truly devastated. Donna {{changed the face of}} pop culture forever. There is no doubt that music would sound {{different}} today if she had never graced us with her talent. She was a super-diva and a true superstar who never compromised when it came to her career or her family. <b>She</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> it with class, dignity, grace and zero attitude. She lived in rare air ... She was the most spectacular, considerate, constant, giving, generous and loving friend of 35 years. I am at a total loss trying to process this tragic news." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Perhaps she would, but I don't think she'd be comfortable; {{or if she}} were, she'd {{make the}} others uncomfortable. <b>She</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> exactly what <b>she</b> pleases." ...|$|R
60|$|She'd say {{something}} unexpected, of course. <b>She</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> {{say something}} unexpected.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} me. <b>She</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> {{have the most}} {{wonderful}} eyes.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes--and locked herself in. <b>She</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> that. Well, I suppose I {{shall see}} her next week." [...] And Mrs. Touchett's husband slowly resumed his former posture.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{probably}} {{lost her}} temper and broke her contract and came away. <b>She's</b> <b>always</b> <b>doing</b> {{that sort of}} thing. She's known for it. She must be a horrid woman." ...|$|R
50|$|War {{and history}} are {{important}} in this novel; Allende has confided <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> thorough historical research for her novels for accuracy. Also, she describes the ultra-conservative characteristics of Chilean society at that time.|$|R
60|$|Altiora {{compressed}} {{her lips}} and shook her head. <b>She</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> shake her head when you asked that of anyone.|$|E
60|$|The girl blushed and curtseyed, {{and said}} shyly that she hoped <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> {{her best to}} keep things neat and clean.|$|E
60|$|Helen {{dismissed}} {{the subject as}} abruptly as <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> when the conversation touched too nearly on the sensitive edge of her soul dreams.|$|E
6000|$|... "That Freeland woman! When I {{think of}} the {{mischief}} <b>she's</b> <b>always</b> <b>done</b> here, by her example and her irreligion--I can't forgive her. I don't believe you'll make any impression on Mr. Freeland; he's entirely under her thumb." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother {{is going}} to offer {{up a lot of}} candles in the church. <b>She</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> when Nostromo has been away fighting. I shall have some to carry up to the Chapel of the Madonna in the Cathedral." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By George, <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>does.</b> If there's {{anything}} wrong it's been with Hugh; and, by George, I don't {{know what it}} is he was up to when you first came home. It wasn't my doing--of course you know that." ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Stanbury was {{standing}} {{up as she}} said this,--as <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> on such occasions, liking {{to have a full}} mastery over the dish.|$|E

6000|$|... "She {{need not}} be afraid to speak," [...] said Ethel, [...] "for <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> it well and winningly. I have seen her give a reproof in so firm and kind a way, and so bright in the instant of forgiveness." ...|$|R
6000|$|That's Maria, I'll swear! <b>She's</b> <b>always</b> <b>doing</b> it. Whenever I hear [...] of some lady fainting about {{upon the}} {{furniture}} at my presence, and [...] sending {{for a glass}} of water, I say to myself, There's Maria at it [...] again, by God! ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, uncommonly so. You will {{hardly believe}} it, but she {{actually}} {{asked me to}} dine. <b>She</b> <b>always</b> <b>does,</b> you know, when she wants to show her good humour. If you'd broken your leg, and she wished to commiserate you, she'd ask you to dinner." ...|$|R

6000|$|Edward, {{finding that}} he was {{diverting}} them, began to make absurd mistakes on purpose, so that Elizabeth was forced to call him to order.

60|$|Mrs. Gradgrind, weakly smiling, {{and giving}} no other sign of vitality, looked (as <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>did)</b> like an indifferently {{executed}} transparency {{of a small}} female figure, without enough light behind it.|$|E
