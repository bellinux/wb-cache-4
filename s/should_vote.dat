5|$|Fifty-eight {{cardinals}} {{were present}} on 9 October when the conclave began. Since Charles II was dying at this time, Spain's cardinal electors were unsure {{of how they}} <b>should</b> <b>vote,</b> {{and they did not}} work closely with electors that were loyal to the Holy Roman Emperor. From the beginning, {{it was clear that the}} impending death of Charles II was likely to cause a lengthy conclave, because the next pope would be expected to respond to the anticipated political crisis in Spain following Charles' imminent death.|$|E
5|$|In August 1843, {{just after}} she turned 25, Stone {{traveled}} by train, steamship, and stagecoach to Oberlin College in Ohio, the country's first college to admit {{both women and}} African Americans. She entered the college believing that women <b>should</b> <b>vote</b> and assume political office, that women should study the classic professions and that women {{should be able to}} speak their minds in a public forum. Oberlin College did not share all of these sentiments.|$|E
5|$|The thirty-five Tribes {{were not}} ethnic or kinship groups, {{but rather a}} generic {{division}} into which Roman citizens were distributed. When the Tribes were created the divisions were geographical, similar to modern Parliamentary constituencies. However, since one joined the same Tribe that one's father belonged to, the geographical distinctions were eventually lost. The order that the 35 Tribes voted in was selected randomly by lot. The order was not chosen at once, and after each Tribe had voted, a lot {{was used to determine}} which Tribe <b>should</b> <b>vote</b> next. The first Tribe selected was usually the most important Tribe, because it often decided the matter. It was believed that the order of the lot was chosen by the Gods, and thus, that the position held by the early voting Tribes was the position of the Gods. Once a majority of Tribes had voted the same way, voting ended.|$|E

25|$|His {{second term}} {{was filled with}} {{controversy}} involving his plan to move the University of Mississippi from Oxford to Jackson. That idea was eventually defeated. During the 1928 presidential election, Bilbo helped Al Smith to carry the state by a large margin; he spread stories that Republican Herbert Hoover had socialized with a black woman, so voters <b>should</b> <b>vote</b> against him.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the theory}} of direct democracy, on the other hand, {{citizens}} <b>should</b> <b>vote</b> directly, not through their representatives, on legislative proposals. Proponents of direct democracy offer varied reasons to support this view. Political activity can be valuable in itself, it socialises and educates citizens, and popular participation can check powerful elites. Most importantly, citizens do not really rule themselves unless they directly decide laws and policies.|$|E
25|$|On 7 August 1965, Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman, seeing no {{alternative}} to avoid further bloodshed, advised the Parliament of Malaysia that it <b>should</b> <b>vote</b> to expel Singapore from Malaysia. Despite last-ditch attempts by PAP leaders, including Lee Kuan Yew, to keep Singapore as a state in the union, the Parliament on 9 August 1965 voted 126–0 in favour of the expulsion of Singapore.|$|E

25|$|In July 2003, the {{hierarchy}} of the Catholic Church in Canada protested the Chrétien government's plans to include same-sex couples in civil marriage. This is significant because Catholicism has a larger number of adherents in Canada than any other religion or denomination, with 43.6% of the population identifying themselves as Catholic. The church criticisms were accompanied by Vatican claims that Catholic politicians <b>should</b> <b>vote</b> according to their personal beliefs rather than the policy of the government.|$|E
25|$|The {{tradition}} {{is seen in}} many shorter episodes of limited minority protest against the United States. During the War of 1812, Federalists conducted a Hartford Convention proposing New England secession during wartime to reopen trade with the declared enemy of the United States. It led to accusations of treason and {{the demise of the}} Federalist Party as a force in American politics. In 1921, the Maryland Attorney General sued to block woman suffrage. He argued in Leser v. Garnett that state legislatures were Constitutionally the sole determiners of who <b>should</b> <b>vote</b> in what federal or state elections, and that the 19th Amendment was improper. The Supreme Court's judicial review of the state court findings held that the 19th Amendment was Constitutional, and that it applied to the women's right to vote in every state. Women now vote in every state under the authority of the U.S. Constitution.|$|E
25|$|There {{were many}} heated ideological {{conflicts}} between the two governments, even on the economic front. Despite an earlier agreement to establish a common market, Singapore continued to face restrictions when trading {{with the rest of}} Malaysia. In retaliation, Singapore did not extend to Sabah and Sarawak {{the full extent of the}} loans agreed to for economic development of the two eastern states. The situation escalated to such an intensity that talks soon broke down and abusive speeches and writing became rife on both sides. Because of this, on 7 August 1965,the then Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman, seeing no alternative to avoid further bloodshed, advised the Parliament of Malaysia that it <b>should</b> <b>vote</b> to expel Singapore from Malaysia. On 9 August 1965, the Malaysian Parliament voted 126 to 0 (with Singaporean delegates not present) to move a bill to amend the constitution providing for Singapore to separate from the Federation of Malaysia.|$|E

25|$|To hear Edward's voice, Bella {{attempts}} cliff-diving {{and nearly}} drowns, {{but she is}} saved by Jacob. Edward, after mistakenly being informed that Bella has committed suicide, travels to Volterra, Italy, to request the Volturi to destroy him. Alice returns to Forks and discovers Bella is alive; she and Bella pursue Edward to Italy and successfully prevent him from showing himself in daylight to humans, an act {{that would result in}} his execution. The trio are taken to the Volturi. Because Bella knows about vampires, the Volturi want to kill her, but Alice claims she has foreseen Bella becoming a vampire. Because most humans are unaware that vampires exist, the Volturi threaten to kill Bella if this does not happen soon. Upon returning home, Edward tells Bella that he never stopped loving her, and he only left Forks because he thought it would protect her. He apologizes for his misguided action and asks for her forgiveness, which Bella quickly grants. Bella, intent on becoming a vampire, decides that Edward's family <b>should</b> <b>vote</b> on her fate. All but Rosalie and Edward vote for her to be changed, but Edward agrees to change her himself if she will marry him.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} December, {{the newly}} formed group [...] "Vermonters for Honest Government" [...] raised $30,000 to air {{television}} advertisements aimed at pressuring legislators to vote for Milne. The group's founder, retired United States Navy Captain Bill Round, said that legislators <b>should</b> <b>vote</b> against Shumlin because [...] "he's promised a lot and failed to deliver." [...] Round did not reveal {{the source of the}} group's funding. Milne said that while he had no connection to the group, he appreciated the sentiment. By contrast, Shumlin said that he would [...] "absolutely not" [...] run any advertisements, nor would he campaign for legislators' votes or spend any money. He added that he was [...] "not worried" [...] about the vote.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{had three}} goals in Reconstruction. He sought a speedy {{restoration}} of the states, {{on the grounds that}} they had never truly left the Union, and thus should again be recognized once loyal citizens formed a government. To Johnson, African-American suffrage was a delay and a distraction; it had always been a state responsibility to decide who <b>should</b> <b>vote.</b> Second, political power in the Southern states should pass from the planter class to his beloved [...] "plebeians". Johnson feared that the freedmen, many of whom were still economically bound to their former masters, might vote at their direction. Johnson's third priority was election in his own right in 1868, [...] a feat no one who had succeeded a deceased president had managed to accomplish, attempting to secure a Democratic anti Congressional Reconstruction coalition in the South.|$|E

40|$|<b>Should</b> <b>voting</b> be compulsory? Many {{people believe}} that it should, and that countries, like Britain, which have never had compulsion, ought to adopt it. As is common with such things, the {{arguments}} are a mixture of principle and political calculation, reflecting the idea that compulsory voting is morally right {{and that it is}} likely to prove politically beneficial. This article casts a sceptical eye on both types of argument. It shows that compulsory voting is generally unjustified although there are good reasons to worry about declining voter turnout in established democracies, and to worry about inequalities of turnout as well...|$|R
500|$|The Estates General convened on 5 May 1789; debate {{began on}} whether the delegates <b>should</b> <b>vote</b> by head or by Estate. If by Estate, then the nobility and clergy {{would be able to}} outvote the commons; if by head, then the larger Third Estate could dominate. Before the meeting, {{as a member of the}} [...] "Committee of Thirty", Lafayette {{agitated}} for voting by head, rather than estate. He could not get a majority of his own Estate to agree, but the clergy was willing to join with the commons, and on the 17th, the group declared itself the National Assembly. The loyalist response was to lock out the group, including Lafayette, while those who had not supported the Assembly met inside. This action led to the Tennis Court Oath, where the excluded members swore to not separate until a constitution was established. The Assembly continued to meet, and on 11 July 1789, Lafayette presented a draft of the [...] "Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen" [...] to the Assembly, written by himself in consultation with Jefferson. The next day, after the dismissal of Finance Minister Jacques Necker (who was seen as a reformer), lawyer Camille Desmoulins led an armed mob. The king had the royal army under the duc de Broglie surround Paris. On 14 July, the fortress known as the Bastille was stormed by the mob.|$|E
