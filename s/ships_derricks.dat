50|$|In {{the period}} {{up to the}} First World War and for about a decade afterwards, all vessels at the {{southern}} end of Lake Tanganyika had to lie offshore at Katuta Bay and unload by lighter or local canoe. This was thought highly unsatisfactory as the SS Liemba was then exposed on a lee shore to storms from the Northerly trade winds which could cause a dangerous sharp swell in the shallow waters of the bay. Also the <b>shipâ€™s</b> <b>derricks</b> could not be used efficiently to unload heavier or bulk cargoes like bags of cement or large oil drums.|$|R

2500|$|The {{ship with}} the 3rd RTR's tanks arrived from Southampton at [...] but {{unloading}} was very slow, as [...] of petrol had been loaded on deck {{and had to}} be moved using only the <b>ship's</b> <b>derricks,</b> as a power cut had immobilised the cranes on the docks. A power cut and a strike by the ship's crew for [...] hours during the night of [...] added to the delay and the captain had intended to leave the harbour without waiting, until he was held up at gunpoint by a 3rd RTR officer. The dock workers were exhausted, having been at work unloading rations for the BEF for many hours and {{it was not until the}} following morning that the vehicles had been unloaded and refuelled. The cruiser tanks had been loaded first {{and had to be}} unloaded after everything else. More delay was caused by the tank guns having been coated in a preservative and loaded separately. The guns had to be cleaned off, before they could be remounted.|$|R

50|$|Although {{cargo of}} this sort can be {{delivered}} straight from a truck or train onto a ship, the most common way is for the cargo to be delivered to the dock {{in advance of the}} arrival of the ship and for the cargo to be stored in warehouses. When the ship arrives the cargo is then taken from the warehouse to the quay and then lifted on board by either the <b>ship's</b> gear (<b>derricks</b> or cranes) or by the dockside cranes. The discharge of the ship is the reverse of the loading operation.|$|R
5000|$|Outwardly the Leninsky Komsomol class <b>ships</b> with cargo <b>derricks</b> {{are similar}} to the ships US [...] "Mariner class", - three {{structures}} (long forecastle, accommodation superstructure at the middle and aftcastle), the Engine Room at the middle, sloping nose, cruising (round) stern. The Leninsky Komsomol class ships had the same length about and less width.|$|R
25|$|It was {{immediately}} {{clear that the}} 1898 explosion had done far more damage to the Maine than previously assumed, and that the ship might not be capable of refloating at all. The caisson plan, however, was nevertheless considered risky. The Special Board sought the approval of President Taft for the caisson plan and the decision to sink the wreck at sea. The work included contracting for local labor wherever possible, but using U.S. Navy <b>ships</b> and <b>derricks.</b> Taft gave his approval on October 13. Taft invited Cuba and Spain to name a representative to be on-site during the salvage operation at all times. The Spanish agreed to observer status. With the plan approved, the Lackawanna Steel Company began manufacturing the interlocking steel piles to create the caisson walls.|$|R

50|$|The {{story begins}} during a voyage on the South China Sea, where {{almost at once}} <b>Derrick's</b> <b>ship</b> {{encounters}} a typhoon. Surviving this perilous experience, the ship under Captain Sullivan reaches shore and completes the rendezvous with Professor Ayrton. The party is equipped for the journey to the road to Samarcand. Members of the party include his relatives, Cousin Ayrton and Uncle Sullivan; Derrick, himself; Sullivan's intrepid companion, Ross; the ship's Chinese cook, Li Han; and one of Captain Sullivan's seamen, Olaf Svenssen. Horses and Mongolian guides are engaged: Derrick becomes a skilled horseman and learns to speak Mongolian. The party follows a circuitous route to the road to Samarcand to travel in safety and to satisfy Professor Ayrton's archaeological wishes. This circuitous route sends the band to areas that reveal interesting aspects of the Chinese, Mongolian and Tibetan cultures.|$|R
5000|$|Derrick is an American {{teenager}} {{who came to}} China with his missionary parents. He was orphaned and taken under his uncle's care aboard the sailing <b>ship</b> The Wanderer. <b>Derrick</b> is {{at the wheel of}} the sailing ship in the South China Sea. The boy's uncle, Captain Sullivan of the Asian Pacific shipping trade, feels {{the time has come to}} prepare Derrick for his future. He, his companion Ross and Derrick's older cousin, all believe that the youth must now leave the ship and attend school in England. This cousin, Professor Ayrton, is en route to China from England. He is an elderly, highly educated man and an expert in oriental archaeology. Derrick is unhappy with the prospect of leaving the ship, and Professor Ayrton proposes [...] "to gild the pill of education" [...] by taking the youth back to England via the famous road to Samarcand.|$|R
40|$|The Derrick Corporation {{participated in}} this project in a slig~ 1 tly {{different}} way. Rather than ship machines to the Coleraine Minerals Research Laboratory pilot plant, two drums of each sample were <b>shipped</b> to the <b>Derrick</b> Corporation laboratory in Buffalo, New York. In addition, Derrick requested that two machines be tested rather than one, so that a previous technology could {{be compared with the}} new. Both changes in protocol were approved by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, for which acknowledgment and thanks are certainly due. Using the feed samples, Derrick staff optimized the separations in an initial series of tests. From these tests, the optimum solids, panel sizes, and other relevant operating conditions were selected before formal test sequences began. The scope of work for this project follows the pattern set in Part 1, in which five tests were completed on each of two feed samples, one from Hibbing Taconite, and one from Northshore Mining. In this case, the number of tests is doubled again to apply to two different screening machines. Part 2 also includes silica and magnetic iron assays on head samples as well as on each size fraction. The separation criteria for these tests was to achieve a split near 100 microns for the Hibbing Taconite material, and an undersize grade close to 90 % - 325 mesh for the Northshore Mining material. After the panels were selected and other operating issues were decided, the formal test sequence involved using two values for feed rate and two values of feed solids that were just higher and just lower than in the initial tests. The idea was to bracket the optimum separation and measure the variation in screen performance as these two parameters varied. For each machine sample combination, the four tests were completed in a 2 x 2 pattern, and a fifth test was a repetition of one of the first four in order to measure experimental error.
