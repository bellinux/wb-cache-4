A <b>swept</b> <b>surface</b> approximation is automatically done, including extraction of the trajectory and the corresponding deforming 2 D curves. The <b>swept</b> <b>surface</b> is described by a map from a real interval to both rigid body deformations and 2 D curves. These 2 D curves are analyzed and decomposed into many elements, which can be edited respectively, and a novel pattern analysis is also performed on these elements to extract curve patterns. These 2 D curves serve as handles for controlling the geometry, and modifications to them can change the geometry directly. Thus, users can just edit the pattern or element curve to control the global geometry. We show the novelty and efficiency of our framework using varietal demonstrations.|$|E

The second approach converts the intersection problem to that of finding the zero-set of polynomial equations in the parameter space.

All the computations required for machining are performed in real time based on the exact surface geometry, including tool path planning, tool path interpolation, tool offsetting, and tool path step-over to achieve a prescribed scallop height. A G-code command (G 05) is introduced to concisely communicate the precise surface geometry and all necessary process parameters to the controller. The <b>swept</b> <b>surface</b> interpolator offers profound accuracy and efficiency advantages over the traditional approach of generating voluminous piecewise-linear/circular tool path approximations as a preprocessing step.

30|$|Luckily, {{we observe}} that a {{significant}} amount of feature regions we can see in 3 D models are cylinder-like and have the nature of sweeping, that is, they can be described by <b>swept</b> <b>surface.</b> In general, it is known as swept volume, which is generated by the motion (including deformation) of arbitrary 3 D object. In this paper, we only consider <b>swept</b> <b>surface</b> generated by restricting the object to be planar curves. The <b>swept</b> <b>surface</b> is a natural, intuitive, and convenient 3 D modeling method with a long history and is widely used in computer-aided design (CAD) field. It is generated by moving curve C 1 (v) along another curve C 2 (u), which are called profile curve and trajectory curve respectively, and C 1 (u) may be deformed during its motion along the trajectory. <b>Swept</b> <b>surface</b> can naturally decompose the shape into the trajectory and associated profile curves. If we restrict C 1 (v) to be planar curves, it can be described and analyzed easily using cross-planes given by local Frenet frames [8] of the trajectory. Then, editing the surface details becomes editing 2 D curves, which provides both convenient and precise controlling of the shape. The most exciting thing is that the analysis of the geometry similarity becomes the analysis of a sequence of 2 D curves, which is much easier. Such analysis also enables the system to supply intelligent editing as mentioned above. These 2 D profile curves can be further decomposed into many elementary elements, including PCA (principle component analysis) and multi-resolution analysis, each of which can be analyzed and edited independently. This is also our main motivation. In CAD field, this is also known as generalized cylinders [9]. Modeling using generalized cylinders is done through construction of the trajectory and the profile curves (cross-section curves), respectively.|$|E

In the areas of this palm-control surface where bulges occur in certain poses of a real hand, the vertices are given their own trajectories, so that the palm forms realistic shapes as the joints bend. Palm lines can also be modeled as valleys in the skin by sketching them on a displacement map on the palmcontrol surface, and activating them when appropriate joint movements take place. Self-intersections and collisions are detected using geometric primitives that are automatically generated from, and deform with, the sweeps and palm surface.
