40|$|Abstract. A single {{roll caster}} {{equipped}} with a scraper was devised to cast the strip with sound free solidified surface. A property of this single caster is equipment of the scraper. Semisolid metal on the free solidified surface was scribed by a scraper and the surface became flat. Center line segregation did not occur as the strip was solidified from single side. The AA 5182 aluminum alloy could be cast at speeds up to 40 m/min. Thickness was about 3 mm. Pressure of the unit width from the scraper was ranging from 0. 1 N/mm to 1. 0 N/mm, and these pressure {{was enough to make}} the free solidified surface flat. Roll cast strip could be cold rolled down to 1 mm. There was not difference between roll contact surface and the free solidified surface after cold rolling by a visual examination. Result of tension test of the roll cast strip was as same as that of D. C. cast and rolled strip. Deep drawing test was operated at the conditions both of the roll contact surface and the free solidified surface was outside. LDR (limited drawing ratio) was same at both conditions and they were 1. 8. Thickness of the strip was controlled by the roll speed, solidification length (length of the melt pool) and pressure of the <b>scraper.</b> The single <b>roll</b> caster is simpler than a twin roll caster. Rigidity for rolling was not needed for the single roll caster. Cost of the roll is half comparing a twin roll caster. The equipment cost of the single roll caster is more economy than that of the twin roll caster...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is to show the {{characteristics}} of two kinds of roll casters for three-layer clad strip of aluminium alloys. Moreover, the characteristics of these twin roll casters were compeered with the early type of roll casters for clad strip. Design/methodology/approach: Design was tried to attain the fabrication of the roll casters to cast the three-layers-clad-strip. One caster was an unequal diameter roll caster equipped with a scraper. The scraper was adopted to prevent the mixture of different kinds of melts of the alloys. The scraper was used to cast the clad strip with clear interfaces between each strip. The other caster was a tandem type roll caster assembled from two vertical type twin roll casters. A vertical type of twin roll was mounted on the other vertical type of a twin roll caster. Findings: Three layers of clad strips could be cast by two kinds of the roll casters developed in the present study. The casting speed was 20 m/min. This speed was much higher at the conventional twin roll caster for the aluminium alloys. Each strip of three layers clad strip was connected strictly. The element of clad strip did not peel at the interface by continuous bending. The as-cast clad strip could be cold-rolled. The element of alloys did not mix at the connecting interface of the strips. The casting conditions which affected the connecting of the strips and condition of interface were investigated and shown in this paper. Research limitations/implications: The width of the strip was from 30 mm to 50 mm. The casting of the wide strip was not investigated. The alloy used in the present study was only aluminium alloys. The length of the cast strip was 3 m. The thickness of element strip was from 0. 8 mm to 1. 5 mm. The difference of the melting temperature of the alloys was within 50 Â°C. The number of the layers was less than three layers. Practical implications: The roll caster invented in the present study can be used for the fabrication of the clad strip. The clad strip is, for example, used for the brazing sheet of the radiator for the automotive industry. Originality/value: There was not a report concerning the roll caster for three layers clad strip. The roll casters for clad strips shown in this paper were of an original process. Especially, the use of the <b>scraper</b> in the <b>roll</b> casting was original...|$|R
