5|$|Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia {{defines a}} Malay as a Malaysian citizen {{born to a}} Malaysian citizen who professes to be a Muslim, habitually speaks the Malay language, adheres to Malay customs, and is {{domiciled}} in Malaysia or Singapore. Though this definition is not according to ancestry lineage, it is however correct in the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> behaviours. Culture, which controls a great proportion of general mentality and social behaviour, is succeeded through the mother tongue and religion. Article 160 unites Malays from different ethnic groups as the prevailing race and thus embraces them with the political prowess to dominate and rule over other races: Chinese, Indians, Kadazan, Iban, Orang Asli etc. This is also apparent from the name of UMNO (United Malays National Organisation), who are a staunch political proponent of this role.|$|E
5|$|The nature {{artist and}} the fantasy artist in Potter are at odds: the mouse, the toad, and the insects share the same habitat but there seems no logical reason for the mouse and the toad to be {{humanised}} while the insects remain their natural selves. Logically, they should be humanised, too. While the toad is an invader like the insects, he does Mrs. Tittlemouse the service of ridding her house of the bees yet is inexplicably excluded from the party, an affront to the reader's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> right and wrong. It is possible Potter's carelessness {{in the details of}} Mrs. Tittlemouse can be attributed to a desire on her part to simply display her ability to draw from nature or to her interest in book production being supplanted by a growing interest in farming and local life and politics in Sawrey.|$|E

40|$|<b>Sense</b> <b>of</b> community, <b>social</b> capital, and {{emerging}} adulthood are all topics of increasing interest in multiple fields {{over the past}} three decades. Both <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community and <b>social</b> capital are predictors of overall well-being for individuals and communities. As emerging adults begin to establish a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> person and place, many have begun to look to young professionals groups as an outlet for networking and identity exploration. There is limited research on the impact of these organizations related to <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community and <b>social</b> capital. This case study is meant to be a starting point to expand the research on this topic. A survey of 97 members of the Young Professionals Networking Group in San Luis Obispo assessed level of participation within the group as well as <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community utilizing the <b>Sense</b> <b>of</b> Community Index (SCI- 2). A one-way ANOVA compared mean differences between established participation levels (low, medium, high). It was determined the more active a member is within the YPNG, the higher <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community they displayed. Six active members were then recruited to participate in a focus group to discover if active participation in YPNG impacts one’s <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> perceived <b>social</b> capital. Open and axial coding of the focus group data indicated that membership within YPNG increases relational qualities that are consistent with the literature on social capital. The results from this case study indicate that active membership in networking groups may lead to a higher <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community and enhanced perceptions <b>of</b> <b>social</b> capital. More research is necessary to determine how one’s <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community and <b>social</b> capital are impacted before and after joining such groups...|$|R

40|$|Depression {{is common}} {{among the elderly}} members of Hong Kong Chinese society. The {{objectives}} {{of the present study}} are to assess the relationship between everyday competence and depressive symptoms and to test whether <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> control and <b>social</b> support mediate and moderate the impact of deterioration in everyday competence on depressive symptoms. The respondents were 393 people aged 60 years and older from a cross-sectional study of a representative community sample of the elderly population in Hong Kong and they were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. In multiple regression analyses, we found that everyday competence was significantly and negatively related to depressive symptoms (β = - 0. 26, p < 0. 01) after we had adjusted age, gender, marital status, years of education, self-rated health status, and number of chronic illnesses. Moreover, both <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> control and <b>social</b> support were mediators in the linkage between everyday competence and depression. However, neither <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> control nor <b>social</b> support moderated the effect of everyday competence on depression. Findings suggest that both <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> control and <b>social</b> support play important roles in the relationship between everyday competence and depression. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

25|$|Externally focused theories, in contrast, {{suggest that}} reunion {{is a way}} for adoptees to {{overcome}} social stigma. First proposed by Goffman, the theory has four parts: 1) adoptees perceive the absence of biological ties as distinguishing their adoptive family from others, 2) this understanding is strengthened by experiences where non-adoptees suggest adoptive ties are weaker than blood ties, 3) together, these factors engender, in some adoptees, a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> exclusion, and 4) these adoptees react by searching for a blood tie that reinforces their membership in the community. The externally focused rationale for reunion suggests adoptees may be well adjusted and happy within their adoptive families, but will search as an attempt to resolve experiences of social stigma.|$|E
25|$|Imbued with a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> justice, Irvine often selects or writes {{songs that}} are based on {{historical}} events and presented from the victim's perspective. Some of these songs chronicle the abject living and working conditions imposed on groups of people: the emigrants; the brutalized migrant workers; the exploited textile strikers or coalminers. Other songs recall the archetypal experiences of single individuals: the woman seduced by an unfaithful man or disowned by her father; the destitute young man ostracized or murdered on the order of his sweetheart’s rich father; the down-on-his-luck farmer or the unemployed worker; the young man inveigled by the army's recruiting sergeant; the scapegoats. Irvine's songs also denounce worker deaths and industrial diseases, and lament the plight of hunted animals. His repertoire includes humorous songs, but also bittersweet ones of unrequited love, or of lovers cruelly separated or dramatically reunited. He also sings about famous racehorses, men or women masquerading in various disguises, a fantastical fox preying on young maidens, and the violent lives of outlaws.|$|E
25|$|At {{about the}} same time as the role of the Panchayat was declining, a number of other {{institutions}} arose that would replace the Panchayat's role in contributing to the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> cohesiveness that the community desperately sought. By the mid-19th century, the Parsis were keenly aware that their numbers were declining and saw education as a possible solution to the problem. In 1842 Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy established the Parsi Benevolent Fund with the aim of improving, through education, the condition of the impoverished Parsis still living in Surat and its environs. In 1849 the Parsis established their first school (co-educational, which was a novelty at the time, but would soon be split into separate schools for boys and girls) and the education movement quickened. The number of Parsi schools multiplied, but other schools and colleges were also freely attended. Accompanied by better education and social cohesiveness, the community's sense of distinctiveness grew, and in 1854 Dinshaw Maneckji Petit founded the Persian Zoroastrian Amelioration Fund with the aim of improving conditions for his less fortunate co-religionists in Iran. The fund succeeded in convincing a number of Iranian Zoroastrians to emigrate to India (where they are known today as Iranis) and the efforts of its emissary Maneckji Limji Hataria may have been instrumental in obtaining a remission of the jizya for their co-religionists in 1882.|$|E
