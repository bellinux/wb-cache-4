50|$|Fourteen {{days after}} the Bencleugh shipwrecked, her sister ship Friendship arrived at Macquarie Island. The Friendship had left Port Chalmers shortly after the Bencleugh. After a short <b>sealing</b> <b>run,</b> the Friendship left with the Bencleugh's three injured sailors and {{as many of the}} {{remainder}} of the Bencleugh crew as could be arranged and returned to Port Chalmers. After arriving at Port Chalmers, the Friendship was immediately fitted out again and dispatched back to Macquarie Island. The Friendship finally returned nearly four months after the wreck of the Bencleugh. The Bencleugh crew busied themselves on the island by sealing and had made 15 tons of oil {{by the time of the}} Friendship's return. After four challenging months, with many of the crew wearing sailcloth for clothes, the Bencleugh crew arrived back in New Zealand in time to celebrate Christmas 1877.|$|E
40|$|AbstractFillet weld is the {{predominant}} weld type used for connecting different elements e. g. in shipbuilding, offshore and bridge structures. One of prevalent research questions is the structural {{integrity of the}} welded joint. Post weld improvement techniques are being actively researched, as high stress areas like an incomplete penetration on the root side or fluctuations in penetration depth cannot be avoided. Development of laser and laser-arc hybrid welding processes have greatly contributed to increase of production capacity and reduction of heat-induced distortions by producing single pass full penetration welds in thin- and medium thickness structural steel parts. Present study addresses {{the issue of how}} {{to improve the quality of}} the fillet welds by welding the <b>sealing</b> <b>run</b> on the root side with defocused laser beam. Welds having incomplete or excessive penetration were produced with several beam angles and laser beam spot sizes on surface. As a conclusion, significant decrease or even complete elimination of the seam irregularities, which act as the failure starting points during service, is achieved...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Mechanical seal end {{faces are}} {{separated}} by a thin fluid film. The thickness of this film must be optimized so as to preventing the serious friction of two end faces and minimizing the fluid leakage. The micro scope condition monitoring of end face is of importance to ensure mechanical <b>seals</b> <b>run</b> normally. A method for measuring the film thickness of end faces and detecting the friction of end faces of mechanical seal has been presented in this paper. Eddy current sensors embedded in the stationary ring of mechanical seals are used to directly measure {{the thickness of the}} liquid-lubricated film. The Eddy current signal is decomposed by empirical mode decomposition into a series of intrinsic mode function. The information reflecting the film thickness is obtained by eliminating the false intrinsic mode function components. Acoustic emission sensor placed on the lateral of stationary ring i...|$|R

50|$|Both SEAL Team FOUR and SEAL Team SIX, the {{predecessor}} to DEVGRU, {{participated in the}} US invasion of Grenada. The SEALs' two primary missions were the extraction of Grenada's Governor-General and the capture of Grenada's only radio tower. Neither mission was well briefed or sufficiently supported with timely intelligence and the <b>SEALs</b> <b>ran</b> into trouble from the very beginning. On Oct 24, 1983, 12 operators from SEAL Team SIX and 4 Air Force Combat Control Team members(CCT) conducted a predawn combat airborne water insertion from C130 Hercules with Zodiac inflatable rubber boats 40 kilometers north of Point Salinas, Grenada. The team inserted with full combat gear in bad weather with low visibility conditions and high winds. Four SEALs drowned and were never recovered. SEALs split into two teams and proceeded to their objectives. After digging in at the Governor's mansion, the SEALs realized they had forgotten to load their cryptographic satellite phone. As Grenadian and Cuban troops surrounded the team, the SEALs' only radio ran out of battery power, and they used the mansion's land line telephone to call in AC-130 gunship fire support. The SEALs were pinned down in the mansion overnight and were relieved and extracted {{by a group of}} Marines the following morning.|$|R

ISIL militants broke into the position using three truck bombs followed by bulldozers which cleared the wreckage away, the U.S. responded with fighter, bomber and drone carrying out 31 airstrikes; which killed 58 IS militants and destroyed 20 vehicles, stopping the attack. Keating IV was part of a nearly 20-man QRF that was sent to rescue a dozen U.S. advisors and to assist the Peshmerga, during the battle the <b>SEALs</b> <b>ran</b> low on ammunition and Keating's machine gun malfunctioned so he went back to a nearby coalition vehicle to get a new weapon and additional ammunition. Keating, now armed with a sniper rifle, climbed on top of a building and began firing on the ISIS fighters.
