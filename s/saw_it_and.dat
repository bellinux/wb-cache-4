5|$|The Great Salt Lake entered written European history {{through the}} records of Silvestre VÃ©lez de Escalante, who learned of its {{existence}} from the Timpanogos Utes in 1776. No European name was given to it at the time, {{and it was not}} shown on the map by Bernardo Miera y Pacheco, the cartographer for the expedition. In 1824, it was observed, apparently independently, by Jim Bridger and Etienne Provost. Shortly thereafter other trappers <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> walked around it.|$|E

To his surprise, he learns that what upset her most was not what he did, but that Bart <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> will one day misconstrue {{it as a sign}} that it is okay to treat women like sex objects. She insists that he take Bart to meet Princess Kashmir so that Bart can see for himself that she {{is more than just a}} stripper. Left with no alternative, Homer and Bart scour the strip clubs of Springfield to find Princess Kashmir. Eventually, they track her down at the Sapphire Lounge.|$|E

Upon {{arriving at the}} Atlantic City morgue, Scully and Mulder discover that the body was eaten by a human. However, the local detective, Thompson, denies the agents access to the investigation. Scully returns to Washington to attend her godson's birthday party, while Mulder stays in New Jersey. At the party, Scully meets Rob, the divorced father {{of one of the}} guests. Meanwhile, Mulder questions homeless people about the case. A man shows him a drawing of a humanoid and tells him that he <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> that the other homeless people and cops know about it. Mulder gives his hotel room key to the man and sleeps in the alley, where he sees a shadowy, human-like creature. He chases the creature, but is arrested before he can catch it.|$|E

25|$|Secretary of the Navy Welles {{was dismayed}} by the failure. The small {{casualty}} list, coupled with Du Pont's evident reluctance beforehand, led him to believe at first that the attack was not pressed with vigor. His criticism softened only when John Rodgers, who {{was known to be}} a thoroughly competent and aggressive officer, sided with Du Pont. As Rodgers <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> as Welles had to agree, Charleston could not be taken by a purely naval assault. It would require a combined operation, with full cooperation of both services, to achieve that.|$|E
25|$|Garrett {{made her}} Broadway debut in 1942 in the revue Of V We Sing, which closed after 76 {{performances}} but {{led to her}} being cast in the Harold Rome revue Let Freedom Sing later that year. It closed after only eight performances, but producer Mike Todd <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> signed her to understudy Ethel Merman and play a small role in the 1943 Cole Porter musical Something for the Boys. Merman became ill during the run, allowing Garrett to play the lead for a week. During this time she was seen by producer Vinton Freedley, who cast her in Jackpot, a Vernon Duke/Howard Dietz musical also starring Nanette Fabray and Allan Jones. The show closed quickly, and Garrett began touring the country with her nightclub act.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, {{a fight between}} Fighter Command and Bomber Command was brewing. Bomber Command was ramping up its campaign, but was {{suffering}} mounting losses {{at the hands of}} Josef Kammhuber's increasingly effective defences. They began pressing for permission to use chaff, known in the UK under the code-name window, which in testing had demonstrated its ability to blind radar systems. Air Chief Charles Frederick Algenon Porter ordered Bomber Command to begin using window on 4 April 1942, but he rescinded that command on 5 May under pressure from Sholto Douglas. Douglas pointed out that the Germans would be able to copy window the first time they <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> it was unwise to use it until its effect on the UK's own radars was better understood.|$|E

25|$|Returning to the District in 1854, Washington {{remained}} there until 1861. He {{had some success}} as a painter of portraits and history paintings, and exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and the National Academy of Design. While working at the Patent Office, in 1855, he drew an unauthorized copy of Leutze's Washington Crossing the Delaware in colored crayon {{on the wall of}} a basement room in the building. The office messenger <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> was preparing to whitewash over it when one of Washington's superiors, William Langdon, praised it; soon the Commissioner of the Patent Office took note, and brought President Franklin Pierce and his Secretary of the Interior, Robert McClelland, to view the picture. So impressed were they that the president returned on the following day, bringing with him his wife and another lady. What became of the picture is unknown, although it was recorded as having been still in place as late as October 1856.|$|E
25|$|As Haliburton did, {{and still}} does, contain a {{tremendous}} amount of game, the Ojibwa tribe did use the area as a summer hunting ground at least at the time of early settlers. At the time of the early settlers in the 1870s and 1880s, there were still small Indian hunting parties passing through the Paudash Lake area during the summer. While they had no permanent camp on the lake, the hunting parties would occasionally spend the night on Wolf Point on Joe Bay or {{at the north end of}} Silent Lake. Certainly Paudash Lake did have an earlier name in the Anishinaabe language spoken by the Ojibwa, as did all major Haliburton lakes. However, very few other major Haliburton lakes have retained Anishinaabe associated names, the most notable being Kashagawigamog (long-winding-water). But settlers did have a tendency of naming lakes after the clan chief who appeared to identify with a lake, as described above, and for that reason the use of the Paudash name could suggest that the Paudash clan frequented that lake and considered it their hunting-fishing territory in the same way Jack's Lake and Eel's Lake were named after two brothers - Jack and Eel, and that settler history shows Jack fiercely claiming his territory (breaking beaver traps set by others). In early settler times, names of lakes were not given by governments but by settlers according to what family or chief/patriarch of clan seemed to claim it their territory. Aboriginal boat using hunter gatherer tribes were organized in this way - and it is a natural pattern because it can be found throughout the northern wilderness among boat-using peoples - they defined their hunting territories according to water basins, and if it was a river, then the extended families or clans claimed tributaries and lakes of that river system. There could be some 5-6 clans on branches of that river system. wandering from campsite to campsite in a territory determined by this activity, dependent on where their canoes could go. But these clans might be small - maybe a dozen or so people - and natural human social needs brought clans together usually annually in a common place. For river oriented clans, that common place would be at the bottom of that river system. Paudash Lake, like Eels and Jacks, not to mention Stoney and others, are all on waterways flowing to Rice Lake; thus Rice Lake became the congregating site and governments <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> most early original reserves were defined at these congregating sites and then the clans were encouraged to remain and farm and not travel to their traditional hunting territory (that was passed down from father to son within a clan). Paudash Lake, thus, is a Rice lake Ojibwa lake, and that is why its name is Paudash - the same as that of a dominant Rice Lake family in Ojibwa history.|$|E

Tracy TormÃ© was then given the job of rewriting it, but some producers thought the new version was too dark until Roddenberry <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> endorsed the new version. In one of the original versions, it was a faction within Starfleet who were conspirators rather than alien parasites, but Roddenberry did not like showing Starfleet itself in such a dark manner.

500|$|Neither Not One Less nor Zhang's other 1999 film The Road Home was {{selected}} for the 1999 Cannes Film Festival's Official Selection, the most prestigious competition in the festival, where several of Zhang's earlier films had won awards.

Rather than have his films shown in a less competitive portion of the festival, Zhang withdrew them both in protest, stating that the movies were apolitical.
